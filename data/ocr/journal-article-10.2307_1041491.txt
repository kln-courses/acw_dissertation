<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some Micro-Economic Reflections on Income and Wealth Inequalities By HARRY G. JOHNSON ABSTRACT: Concern about inequality involves naive anthro- pomorphism and the Judaic-Christian tradition. Both lead to anachronistic images of modern society and to concern with sharing its presumably effortlessly-acquired surplus. Ob- served inequality in contemporary society is largely the by- product of the success of that society in providing opportuni- ties for self-fulfillment. As examples, consumption needs and income-earning capacity are poorly synchronized over time, implying cross-sectional inequalities between people at differ- ent ages; people's consumption preferences also differ early and late in life. People differ in their preferences for either risky or safe occupations. The policy problem of inequality reform is to correct inequalities of opportunity without taxing socially useful exercises of choice and subsidizing socially undesirable ones. One of the major sources of difficulty is the role of the family in the transmission of material property, genetic char- acteristics-good or bad-and attitudes towards work and life. Few, indeed, would be prepared to alter sufficiently the insti- tution of the family to eliminate these family-transmitted sources of inequality. Harry G. Johnson is Professor of Economics at both the London School of Economics and the University of Chicago, and was recently Irving Fisher Visiting Professor at Yale University. Educated at the Universities of Toronto, Cambridge and Harvard, he has written widely on both social policy relating to inequality and the pure theory of income distribution; his most recent book is The Theory of Income Distribution. 53</page><page sequence="2">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY T HE subject of inequalities of in- come and wealth is of perennial interest, erupting into acute concern from time to time. Such eruptions show a high degree of correlation with two frequently-but not necessarily- related phases of economic and political development: (1) serious, and/or pro- longed, depression which both frustrates prevalent expectations of prosperity, se- curity and rising standards of living and generates private and public concern over the growth of income and the ex- ploitation of opportunities for increasing income in the future through application and planning; (2) loss of national self- confidence, with respect to both the purposiveness of the political process and the quality of life provided by the economic system, which the political process is presumed to direct to the ser- vice of aims nobler than the mere satis- faction of material wants. In the mod- ern world, with its rapid international communications system, concern with inequality in the United States tends to spread to other countries that lack the same objective domestic reasons for dis- content. For example, recent discussion of poverty in Canada and the United Kingdom can be fairly reliably traced back to the United States: first in the case of the early 1960s, to the evident and well-publicized failure of Blacks, and of poor people generally, to par- ticipate in the national affluence; and later, to the demoralizing effects, espe- cially upon educated and draftable young males, of the expensive fiasco in Vietnam. THE FOUNDATIONS FOR CONCERN WITH INEQUALITY The underlying foundations for spo- radic, acute concern with inequality seemingly consists of two elements. The first is a naive and basically infan- tile anthropomorphism: because men are physically identical-at least, men in reasonably homogeneous ethnic and other social groupings-inequalities in the socially determined capacity to sat- isfy biological and social wants are con- sidered unjust. Such anthropomor- phism either disregards or denies the social role of these inequalities in moti- vation and reward, which contribute to the organization of the society for sur- vival and progress in the face of erosive internal and external pressures. The second element is the historical, Western inheritance of the Judaic-Christian tra- dition: the equality of man before God. Originally, this belief was primarily an affirmation of the right to survival and self-fulfillment for a minority group against which there was discrimination; now-following the advent of the In- dustrial Revolution and the associated rise of popular democratic government- it has been shorn of its countervailing affirmation of the religious legitimacy of duly constituted authdrity and status differentiation by the materialistic sec- ularization of culture. In essence, these elements are emo- tional rather than rational; as a result, they lend themselves both to the inter- pretation of current social organization in terms of archaic myths and to the projection of personal self-doubts and strains engendered by life in modern society. In particular, there are strong tendencies to interpret modern society in terms of feudal or early industrial structures which were based upon the family inheritance of landed or accumu- lated property in the nonhuman means of production. This interpretation is especially anachronistic for those soci- eties which are based upon the oppor- tunity for immigrants to escape limita- tions, imposed by a class structure, on economic and social mobility. Amer- ican society is an explicit-although not singular-prototype; other societies are 54</page><page sequence="3">MICRO-ECONOMIC REFLECTIONS ON INEQUALITY also increasingly incorporating elements of social reward for economic achieve- ment. Furthermore, there are tend- encies to identify equality with the universal opportunity to enjoy the ad- vantages of cultivation of self-for- merly reserved to the few who mo- nopolized the economic surplus above subsistence through capture, accumula- tion, ownership and careful administra- tion of scarce nonhuman factors of production-without worrying about how a surplus of sufficient size can be created and maintained if no one is entitled to the profits of minding the store. These misinterpretations of the prob- lem lead to an exaggerated and naive conception of the importance of, and urgent need to correct, inequality. This naivete is reflected in the use of such superficial and irrelevant statistics as: the top x percent of the population re- ceives a percent of the income-where x is a small fraction and a a sufficiently large integer to convey the impression of obscenity. They also lead to ana- lytically weak or unsupported recom- mendations for policy, such as remedy- ing inequality by giving large sums, taken from those who currently have high incomes, to those who have not. PROBLEMS OF DETERMINING INEQUALITY This is not to deny that there are serious ethical problems of inequality about which something should be done. However, I wish to assert that the problem should not be viewed in terms of the absolute ethical principle that all men should be economically and socially equal, but rather ought to be viewed and analyzed in terms of a sophisticated understanding of the mechanisms of modern society's eco- nomic organization. The essential point in this assertion is that observed in- equality in income distribution is, to a large extent, a by-product of the modern economic system. The success of a modern economic system lies in its providing opportunities of free choice and self-fulfillment for man-considered, in the short run, as having diverse tastes, preferences and attitudes; in the long run, as being mortal, with a limited life-span of pat- terned change in physical, mental and social characteristics; and as having hopes of transcendental immortality de- pendent upon the procreation of his species. The economic opportunities which the system provides should be consistent with the survival and prog- ress of human society and not depen- dent upon the institutions of legal or de facto slavery that characterized earlier systems. Therefore, in a broad sense, the problem of inequality is that of determining the areas in which, and the extent to which, modern society falls short of this ideal generalization; of devising appropriate remedies for these shortcomings; and of avoiding the danger of superficial solutions to prob- lems at the expense of creating new and more intractable basic difficulties. In traditional debates on the subject of inequality, the conservative defense of things-as-they-are rests upon the proposition that inequality is necessary to provide incentives for hard work, discipline, inventiveness and accumula- tion; the only exception customarily allowed is the legitimacy of the claims of the deserving poor-that is, those who are poor through no fault of character or circumstance of their own- on the conscience of the rich. This posi- tion is indefensible not simply because it is easy to pick holes in its almost complete endorsement of all inequalities but, more fundamentally, because it entails an antidemocratic instrumental 55</page><page sequence="4">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY concept of the relation of the citizen to the state. The point being made here is quite different: the exercise of the alterna- tives of choice provided to the citizen necessarily give rise to observed in- equalities of income, as conventionally measured. Efforts to prevent this out- come, or to cancel it out by post facto income redistribution, run the serious risk of depriving the citizen of the benefits of freedom of choice and self- fulfillment and of eventually requiring a reversion to a more authoritative, or totalitarian, structure of society and the state.1 This point rests firmly upon: various recent developments in the micro-economic analysis of the func- tioning of the labor market, most notably the life cycle theory of the con- sumption function; the concept of hu- man capital; the analysis of the impli- cations for career choices of varying attitudes towards risk and future, versus present, consumption; and the detailed theory of leisure as a consump- tion good. To put the point very briefly and generally, one can ignore differences among individuals in opportunities and capacities for economic performance, for the moment, and concentrate on the implications of significant differences in tastes and preferences. One can expect to observe the following phenomena- as well as others not listed-all of which 1. An important signpost is the tendency for Western governments to be increasingly pressed towards the use of incomes policy as a means of controlling the inflation, conse- quent on state assumption of responsibility for full employment, as a matter of achieving the two presumed social objectives of eco- nomic efficiency and economic equality. What is initially intended as a macro-economic policy for eliminating a socially undesirable side-effect in pursuit of these objectives in- evitably becomes a range of micro- interven- tions in the freedom of individual economic decisions. would lead to observed differences in labor income on a cross-sectional basis and some of which, to observed differences in wealth and property.2 Economic characteristics of the human life span First, the individual life span is eco- nomically characterized by nonsynchro- nous patterned variation with age, in both material consumption needs and potential productive contribution. On the consumption side, the typical pat- tern involves limited but gradually ex- panding needs during a first period of upbringing and education; a multiplica- tion of needs in the phase of family formation, child-bearing and child- rearing; a phasing out of these needs as children, in their turn, mature and leave home; and a subsequent diminu- tion of needs with aging and the ap- proach of death, possibly with a final upsurge of needs for medical attention and physical care. On the production side, the individual begins life incapa- ble of productive contribution and de- pendent upon parental provision; defers the exploitation of immediate produc- tive potential for the sake of investment in education to increase future produc- tive potential; acquires increasing poten- tial through job experience up to some peak point, after which capacity gradu- ally depreciates; and retires from active participation in production, long before death. These nonsynchronous consumption and production patterns over the life span would imply cross-sectional in- equality of income and wealth. These inequalities would exist because incen- tives to earn money, rather than to en- joy leisure, vary with age and family 2. For further discussion see, Harry G. Johnson, The Theory of Income Distribution (London: Gray-Mills Publishing, 1973), espe- cially the final two chapters. 56</page><page sequence="5">MICRO-ECONOMIC REFLECTIONS ON INEQUALITY responsibility-in youth, with claims on family resources. Furthermore, it is rational to convert human capital- earning power-into material capital and vice versa-for example, by borrow- ing or by investing in income-yielding property in order to finance family formation, possibly education of self, and/or children, and retirement. Obvi- ously, such cross-sectional, statistically- created evidence of inequality, where in essence there is none, should not be interpreted as indicating a significant social problem. Individual preferences Second, individual choices reflecting differences in preferences will produce observed inequalities of labor income, property income or wealth among indi- viduals at the same phase of the life cycle. People can legitimately differ in their preferences: some may prefer an early, austere, hard-working and pro- ductive life for the sake of a comfort- able old age as an independent worker or affluent retired person; others may prefer to live it up in their youth while hoping that their future will take care of itself. They can also legitimately differ in their preferences for either fam- ily formation and child upbringing or more personal leisure and material con- sumption, in the potential child-raising and subsequent phases of the life cycle. They may choose between a fixed com- mitment to regular, but limited, hours of work and the freedom to work in concentrated spurts, punctuated by pe- riods of voluntary idleness; or between either high material consumption and scanty leisure or low material consump- tion and ample leisure-where leisure should be interpreted broadly to include such phenomena as: the long paid holi- days available to school teachers and civil servants; the opportunity to serve one's fellow men through political, charitable and civic-minded activity; the opportunity to entertain oneself by exercising one's mental and physical talents.3 Risk Finally, given the uncertainties of career choice in an uncertain world, people may legitimately differ in their attitudes towards risk. Those who dis- like risk will settle for careers which offer greater security, at the expense of a lower prospective average income for such people as a group. Those who enjoy risk will opt for careers with a prospect of an exceptionally high in- come, at the expense of possible sub- stantially lower individual income and also of a lower average income for such people as a group than would be obtainable in safer occupations. A society composed of a majority of risk-averters would be statistically char- acterized by the presence of a relatively small number of extremely high incomes and of incomes not far below the aver- age. By contrast, a society composed of a majority of risk-takers would be statistically characterized by a relatively high number of very low incomes and of incomes not much above the average. The former society would presumably view its income distribution problem as one of inordinate income inequality; the latter, as one of unwarranted large scale poverty. In both cases, the statistical facts are the outcome of voluntary choice. To make a social problem of them would require introducing the ad- 3. In place of resenting those people whose life-style involves high and conspicuous con- sumption of material goods, one might well pity them for the poverty of personal and cultural resources that make this life-style their optimal choice. Some radicals, of course, manage to meld resentment and contempt to a high pitch of moral indignation about those who live more richly and ostentatiously than they, themselves. 57</page><page sequence="6">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ditional-although not unreasonable- assumption that the choices of a signifi- cant number of society's members are biased by ignorance of opportunities and risks, a lack of resources to exploit opportunities and/or the fact that in- equalities in the achievements of parents are unfairly passed on to their chil- dren as inequalities of knowledge and resources for exploiting opportunities. SUGGESTED REMEDIES FOR INEQUALITY The conclusion to be drawn from this brief analysis is that ethically-motivated social concern about inequality should properly focus on inequalities of oppor- tunities and the knowledge and re- sources required to exploit them prop- erly. It should not focus on the sta- tistical facts of measured inequality which indiscriminately reflect both in- equality of original opportunities and rational, voluntary choices among avail- able opportunities intended to maximize individual self-fulfillment. Analysis and remedies that focus on the resultant in- come distribution-and attempt to cor- rect it by redistributive, progressive in- come and inheritance taxes and social security systems-will, if implemented, have unintended or, perhaps even worse, intended side effects. Such taxation will disproportionately burden those who have preferences for non-procreation- that is, for high-quality, low-number families rather than high-quantity, low- quality, high-public-expense families; preferences for future, over present, con- sumption; preferences for high-skilled, over low-skilled, careers; preferences for material, over leisure, consumption; and preferences for risky, high-payoff, over secure, low-payoff, careers. In effect, some of the preferences that would be subsidized are definitely antisocial. Apart from the public or tax-payers' expense imposed by private indulgence in fecundity, losses accrue to society if those with creative talents choose leisure rather than work or further development of their talents through rigorous training. The absence of social devices for pooling many career risks implies that private risk-taking tends to be on too low a scale for social optimality, anyway. Moreover, advo- cacy of redistributionary taxation and expenditure policies almost invariably assumes that habits of hard work and honesty will survive fiscal mauling; however, tax avoidance and evasion re- spond readily to profit incentives-espe- cially if the taxes are thought to be unjust-and, in the long run, social institutions and customs adapt to pro- duce the kind of people favored by the fiscal system.4 The suggestion to focus equalitarian policies on providing information about, and resources for, exploiting available opportunities carries with it a number of obvious implications for the types of policies that might effectively be pur- sued: better schooling for the children of the poor; better public health care for all children; loan finance to cover maintenance costs and fees for educa- tion for the older children of impecu- nious parents; earlier and more direc- tive career counseling; and public assistance to, or provision of, more information abopt available, alterna- tive jobs, coupled with grants or loan assistance to facilitate geographical and occupational mobility. Even policies of that kind raise ques- tions about how they will operate in 4. The author has encountered complaints in Sweden that the younger generation is unwilling to adopt careers requiring responsi- bility and hard work, and in the United Kingdom that it is impossible to do the private saving required to attain a modicum of independence. In the United States, com- plaints are mounting that welfare makes it preferable for inordinately large numbers of people to opt out of work entirely. 58</page><page sequence="7">MICRO-ECONOMIC REFLECTIONS ON INEQUALITY practice. A variety of evidence suggests that, as an approximation, existing gov- ernment tax and expenditure policies re- distribute income from the very rich and the very poor towards the middle class. There is also massive evidence from the results of the short-lived War on Pov- erty, launched by President Johnson in 1964, that crash programs and bright ideas directed at the surface of the problem primarily waste resources. Low and uncertain incomes are not merely low and uncertain incomes; they are a way of life, a culture that will take a long-sustained and expensive ef- fort to transform. A large part of this problem is the role of the family in relation to its offspring in the period of social conditioning which precedes full adulthood, signalled by the entry into the labor force, and which, to all ap- pearances, dominates over the social conditioning provided by the formal education system. In an important sense, modern society has created this problem for itself. It is a by-product of its success in achiev- ing affluence and a consequence of both the narrowing down of the kinship system to the nuclear family and the social ordering of the community to include only casual social relationships with business acquaintances or a few economically-equally-situated neighbors. The result of this, along with the ex- treme specialization of parental par- ticipation in the economic system, is to limit severely the growing child's knowl- edge of the economic world-particu- larly in the least affluent families con- fined to ghetto life-and the family's resources available for investment in the exploitation of economic opportunities. Furthermore, the pace of economic change and increasing affluence fre- quently makes the knowledge parents have of the world out of date and mis- leading; thus, youth is less willing to take parental advice than was the youth of former days-when both boys and girls could expect to live their adult lives more or less as their parents had- who could benefit from their parents' instruction and example. The family's role in child-rearing raises two major difficulties for policies seeking to increase equality. One, which is relatively minor, is that the motiva- tion for, or the by-product of, material success is the capacity to accumulate material property and to pass it on to one's children, thereby relieving them of the necessity to work for a living. Much contemporary inheritance taxa- tion-and still more, swingeing inheri- tance tax proposals which have been advanced-aim to eliminate this effect of economic success as far as possible. Judging from the relative stability of statistics on inequality of ownership of property, the results seem to have been nugatory, by and large. To be effective in decreasing inequality, inheritance taxes should be graduated according to the amounts received by individual ben- eficiaries, as well as by their individual personal means, rather than by the size of the estate. However, their effect is largely negated because such taxes can be avoided in countless ways by fore- sighted and perfectly legal action. On the other hand, there is much qualita- tive evidence that large individual ac- cumulations of wealth tend to be dis- persed in a generation or two, frequently into worthy charitable purposes. Exces- sive concern over unearned economic advantages enjoyed by the first genera- tion of descendants may well be too myopic as a basis for equalitarian eco- nomic reform. Of course, it is our own generation of descendants of the rich that irk us the most acutely; only as we age, do we see that their children turn out no better than ours-and sometimes far worse-and then realize, too late, 59</page><page sequence="8">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY that our childhood resentments were unjustified. The far more serious problem of in- equality associated with inheritance is concerned with the bequeathing of less tangible, but probably far more impor- tant, productive assets than material property. In the modern economy-as John K. Galbraith's major life work emphasizes-it is not property as such, but the ability to manage property and to combine it productively with other inputs under shrewd management, that counts. Success in this context depends broadly upon three characteristics of the individual that may be classified, in one way or another, as inherited: native ability, inherited genetically; educa- tion which, although nominally pro- vided equally for all through the formal education system, depends upon inheri- tance-in the sense of a family back- ground of parental interest, encourage- ment and willingness to spend real resources and time to complement and augment the formal educational experi- ence-for its absorption and effective use; and an elusive quality which in- corporates determination and ability to accept responsibility and hard work for no immediate return in discharging it- again a matter of family background and parental example which, unfortu- nately, does not appear to be communi- cated equally to children of the same parents. CONCLUSION The late Frank H. Knight was fond of pointing out, in criticism of the equalitarians of his day, that there is no more ethical justification for inequal- ity of an individual's capacity to exploit opportunities, derived from genetical in- heritance, than there is for inequalities of inheritance of property. This point seems incontrovertible-although it suits the book of society's critics whose supe- rior position in society derives from their intellectual brilliance and literary facil- ity to identify inequality as inequality derived from property income. In fact, such inequality is probably less of a fundamental social problem than the other forms of inherited inequality just mentioned; personal concentrations of material property are probably more easily dissipated by foolishness and force of circumstance than personal con- centrations of familial, genetical and behavioral characteristics. Knight was firmly convinced that it would be impossible to eliminate effec- tively, or to reduce significantly, in- equalities associated with nontangible familial inheritance. Utopian philoso- phers throughout history have struggled with the problem. However, their thoughts concentrated on the organiza- tion of relatively small communities, living an austere life based upon a relatively simple and unchanging eco- nomic technology; the societies they idealized were highly regimented and joyless constructions, certain eventu- ally to run out of great ideas whose contemplation would liberate the human spirit. In fact, this has been amply demonstrated by the unhappy experi- ence and eventual collapse of the vast majority of utopian communities. Today, one could conceivably do far better to ensure equality of juvenile training and opportunity; vast scientific resources of modern genetics are avail- able, as well as material resources and administrative knowledge necessary for the raising of children under far more comfortable regimentation-psychologi- cal and physical-than that which is currently provided even by the best or- phanages. Yet, which bold, but soci- ally respectable, philosopher-not to mention which political party-would have the courage to suggest seriously the complete supersession of the family by the scientific orphanage, now or in the foreseeable future? 60</page></plain_text>
