<plain_text><page sequence="1">Impact of Regulations on R&amp;D The Costs and Effects of Regulations Paul F. Chenea In 1974 the cost of regulations ran over $1 billion for General Motors. While some of this cost is justified, the author believes that over-regulation is resulting in unnecessary costs and his hobbling research. The founder of GM research, Charles F. Kettering once said, "One of the things we have to be thank ful for is that we don't get as much government as we pay for." That was some time ago. Today, I think he would probably add, "But in some areas of regulation, we're getting more government than we can afford." Regulatory agencies are a growth industry. Since the creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1887, Congress has set up 82 regu latory agencies. These agencies now employ 64,000 people. Their budgets in 1976 will total $2.9 bil lion. In 1975 they published 45,000 pages of rules, regulations, standards, and notices in the Federal Register. Fourteen new agencies were legislated into existence in the last eight years. None of them has been abolished. The politician and jurist, James F. Byrnes, summed it up well when he commented, "The nearest approach to immortality on earth is a government bureau." What Regulations Cost GM Last year, General Motors undertook a corpora tion-wide study to determine just what the costs are to GM of the regulations generated by all of these agencies. More than one hundred plant loca tions and a dozen staffs spent several months devel oping the information. We are repeating the proc ess this year, and will probably continue to do so on an annual basis. Table 1 gives a summary of the impact on the Dr. Chenea is vice president, Research Laboratories, Gener al Motors Corp. He received degrees at the University of California and University of Michigan and taught at several schools before joining GM in 1958. This paper was pre sented at the Fall Meeting of the Industrial Research Insti tute last October. entire General Motors Corporation in 1974 of com plying, or preparing to comply, with government regulations. (Figures for 1975 are not available yet.) The grand total cost, estimated to be $1.3 billion, does not include the cost of emission con trol and safety hardware on our products; nor does it include the taxes we pay. The regulation-related work involved the equivalent of the full-time effort of about 25,300 employees.

In some areas corporate records aren't maintained in a fashion that facilitates determination of the cost of government regulation. In these areas, we estimated our costs. But the figures are as accurate as we could make them. The employees column includes clerical and other support personnel as well as technical personnel. The hours worked as a result of regulations were totaled and then con verted to the equivalent number of employees working a calendar year.

The costs of the first three categories — Regula tion of Vehicles, Regulation of Plant Facilities, and Government Reports and Administrative Costs Related to Regulation — are covered in more detail in Tables 2,3, and 4. The figures on vehicle regula tion are fairly self-explanatory. The greatest ex penditure is, of course, in automotive emission control. Our research and development effort on alternative power sources is also included in this $454 million figure. In Table 4, the amount re ported for Industrial Relations reflects GM's ex penses associated with administering the Civil Rights Act, the Occupational and Safety Health Act, and similar items. Environmental Activities covers administrative expenditures involving such things as the Clean Air Act and the Federal Water Pollution Act. Legal Activities covers items such as the costs of gathering data for antitrust investiga tions and of patent work. Taxes relates primarily to the costs of preparing tax reports. It does not include the taxes, themselves. Other covers a multi tude of things not covered elsewhere. For instance, it includes administrative costs relating to the En dangered Species Act. GM was involved in this act through our former use of whale oil in transmission fluids. Regulation-Prompted Research These cost figures are an indication of the ex tent of GM's total involvement in existing or anti Table 4/Impact of Government Reports and Administrative Costs Related to Regulations on General Motors in the 1974 Calendar Year Equivalent Expenditures Full-Time in Millions Employees Industrial Relations $ 44 1,400 Environmental Activities 43 1,000 Legal Activities 26 800 Energy Management 21 200 Taxes 12 400 Business Statistics 3 100 Marketing Functions 3 100 Other 38 900 TOTAL $190 4,900 cipated government regulations. The General Motors Research Laboratories, of course, plays a part in this involvement. Our regulation-prompted research moves in many directions, all of them challenging. For example, researchers in the Soci etal Analysis Department have been engaged, among other things, in a program of psychoacous tical studies to find answers to the question: "What is noise pollution?" Noise is a tricky thing to eval uate. The annoyance potential of a specific sound goes far beyond its intensity. The scratch of a fin gernail on a blackboard can set teeth on edge, while the gurgle of a brook can be relaxing. Noises that please some people bother others. We need to know more about a noise if we are to assure that government regulations are realistic. To get some answers, our Societal Analysis Department psychologists have designed a set of experiments that they hope will eventually lead to the quantification of annoyance due to traffic noise. In one experiment, for example, a group of 20 non-GM people were exposed to a set of 13 traffic noises. The people listened to pairs of these sounds played through a high fidelity sound repro duction system in a semi-anechoic chamber. They rated each pair of sounds in terms of which sound they preferred and of how dissimilar the two sounds were. Our psychologists analyzed their re sponses with sophisticated scaling methods and related them to the physical measures that charac terized the physical differences of the various traf fic noises. They found that one noise measure ment, the average equivalent energy level, ac counted for most of the differences in preferability and similarity between the various sounds. Other programs of our societal analysis re searchers involve intensive benefit-cost analyses of automotive pollution abatement and surveys of cost-effectiveness studies to determine where ex penditures will pay off best in terms of additional years of life.

The GM Biomedical Science Department is another group doing imaginative research. Not satisfied with chest impact studies using pigs, cadavers, and anthropomorphic dummies, the bio medical researchers turned to the real thing. They found a circus stunt diver, named Henri La Mothe, who routinely launches himself from a 34-foot tower into a tank of water a foot deep. He hits the water at about 32 miles per hour, but survives by curving his body and taking the impact on his chest. Our researchers instrumented him and made exhaustive studies of what happened to his body on impact. They were encouraged to learn that the human chest could regularly withstand impacts in excess of current government standards. The GM Environmental Science Department has a mobile atmospheric laboratory, the only such mobile sampling lab in the automotive industry. Over the past five years it has crisscrossed the United States, amassing a wide range of pollutant and air quality data. More recently, it has been used to study ozone concentrations in rural areas. And its travel agenda keeps growing. Unnecessary Defensive Research Over the past decade, GM's research and devel opment spending to meet safety, emission, and fuel economy standards imposed by regulatory agencies has grown until it accounts for close to half of our R&amp;D budget. Some of this research GM would be doing anyway, in order to make our vehicles as safe as possible and to mitigate or eliminate any adverse health or environmental effects related to their use. We are heavily involved right now in research aimed at increasing vehicle fuel economy. And we'd be so involved whether the government man dated it or not. For one thing, as good corporate citizens, we want to do what we can to stretch the nation's dwindling oil reserves. And for another, as practical persons, we know that more and more consumers will soon begin demanding more fuel miserly cars as the price of gasoline goes up. So, we have every incentive to make our cars more fuel efficient. However, much of our regulation-related re search we feel shouldn't be necessary. And that's research we're forced to do to defend ourselves against regulations based on faulty or incomplete data. The sulfate experiment we ran over a year ago is one example of this sort of defensive re search. The sulfate question arose when the cataly tic converters were introduced on American cars in 1975. The converters do an excellent job of clean ing up hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emis sions in car exhausts by oxidizing them. But they also oxidize the sulfur compounds in fuel to sul ates. EPA scientists began to question whether these sulfates could build up to hazardous levels along roadsides as more and more cars in the future be came equipped with the converters. So they cal culated sulfate concentrations in the air near busy expressways, using a mathematical model originally designed to predict long distance dispersion from stationary smokestacks. This model predicted trouble. Under unusual meteorlogical conditions, roadside sulfate concentrations might reach health threatening levels, it prophesied. Rumblings about setting sulfate emission standards for 1979 and later model cars began emanating from the EPA. GM did not agree with the EPA's sulfate pre dictions. Roadside sampling done along Detroit and Los Angeles freeways led our environmental scientists to feel that the EPA's figures were much too high. And we had reservations about the dis persion model the EPA had used. To settle the matter, we decided to simulate crowded freeway conditions of the future with catalyst-equipped cars and measure the sulfates produced. Other auto manufacturers, the EPA, the Department of Transportation, Brookhaven Na tional Laboratory, and others participated. The experiment was run at the GM Proving Ground at Milford, Michigan, with a test fleet of 352 catalyst-equipped vehicles. We erected six towers across the roadway. There were three sam pling points on each tower to sniff out emissions at different heights, and two additional ground level sampling points to measure sulfates and take weather readings. Mobile laboratories brought to the site took additional measurements. We ran two lanes of cars in either direction on the 2'/2 mile track at 50 miles per hour on the straightaway. The cars were driven in platoons of 22 vehicles each with a gap between the platoons to compensate for the slowing of the cars on the turns. In this way we achieved a traffic density of 1365 vehicles per lane per hour. Our researchers did everything they could to build up road side emissions. Even the days and time of day were specially chosen for weather conditions that would cause emissions to hover close to the ground and thus maximize sul fate readings. From the massive amount of data compiled it was learned that the EPA estimates of potential sulfate buildup at ground levels along busy free ways were up to 20 times too high. The sulfate particles are very small and disperse like a gas. The EPA model, which predicted that the sulfates would hover in high concentration close to the ground, did not take proper account of the effect of vehicle turbulence which causes the sulfates to be efficiently mixed upwards. As a result of this experiment and other data, the EPA has announced it will not now propose a sulfate emission standard. What did this bit of de fensive research cost the GM Research Labs? Close 24/Research Management</page><page sequence="4">to a million dollars. A million dollars we had to spend on research because a regulatory agency had not done its homework. A million dollars we could have put to more productive uses. Here's another example of unnecessary re search. The auto industry has been trying unsuc cessfully for some time to develop technology to meet the statutory 0.4 gram per mile standard for nitrogen oxide emissions, in spite of the fact that the EPA and a large segment of the scientific com munity have long recognized that the standard was not only based on faulty data but is also substan tially more stringent than necessary to meet air quality needs. No evaluation of benefits and costs was made before the standard was set. Later, after the direct benefit-cost relationship was shown to be negative, it was too late. The law was on the books. And it still is. We are also subjected to conflicting require ments from different agencies. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to enforce emission standards; the Energy Policy and Conservation Act requires the Department of Transportation to enforce fuel economy standards — both with unneeded help from Congress. At the present state of the art, the technical fixes we can apply to reduce emissions work at cross-purposes to improve fuel economy. We can't do both to the extent proposed. From its beginnings, 56 years ago, the primary mission of the GM Research Laboratories has been to create new technical knowledge in areas that are, or may be, of commercial interest to General Motors. Until a few years ago, when regulations began siphoning off our dollars, this was the main thrust of our research effort. And it should still be. In spite of the sophistication and refinement of today's automobile, there is much that can be done to make it even better. Effects of Over-Regulation So far I have talked about the involvement of General Motors Research Laboratories with govern ment regulations and about some of the problems of the auto industry in general. Let's now look at the broader picture — the effect of over-regulation on the national economy. Over-regulation penalizes us all. Ever tightening auto emission controls, for example, obviously adds to the cost of products. "Inflation by fiat," one writer recently called it. The U.S. News and World Report estimated last year that Federal regu lations, taken all together, add $130 billion a year to the cost of what people buy. That is about $2000 for each American family. And let us not forget that the consumer pays a second time in taxes to support the regulatory agencies. In addition to what regulation is costing in dividual corporations, in lost research opportu nities, we must consider the "opportunity cost" to the nation. Researchers in the GM Societal Analy sis Department recently surveyed cost-effectiveness studies of 27 different mortality risks. They re ported the cost of programs to reduce these risks in terms of dollars per year of additional life. The studies ranged from a uterine cancer screening pro gram, which it was estimated would cost $110 for each additional year of life expectancy to the statutory carbon monoxide emission standard of 3.4 grams per mile, which, based on the best data available, would cost an estimated $22 million for each additional year of life expectancy. Obviously, funds allocated to the cancer screening program would provide many times the return of the carbon monoxide emission standard. I should point out that the present carbon monoxide emission stand ard is 15 grams per mile; the 3.4 grams used in this study is a standard now required by law for 1978. We must face the questions : How do you measure the cost of lives sacrificed because funds are diverted to less effective pro grams? How do you measure the cost of foregoing al ternative benefits from education, housing, mobil ity, national security, space exploration, the arts — all aspects of the quality of life? And how do you measure the cost in individual freedoms which are eliminated when policy makers impose their authority, their values, on a nation? In all fairness we have to admit that some regu lations are necessary. Safety, for example, doesn't sell. It must be legislated. And no car buyer will voluntarily pay extra for emission hardware on his vehicle. Thus, I don't mean to imply that all gov ernment regulation is bad and should be elimi nated. Far from it. Reasonable regulation is re quired for the common good. With our population growing and our resources dwindling, regulation is essential to our survival. Government regulation is vital to any organized society and, to the extent that it is necessary, we are prepared to pay the costs. Needed: Necessary and Resonable Regulations Necessary and reasonable. These are the two criteria against which all government regulation should be measured. We Americans tend to think there's a legislative solution to every problem. But sometimes — and I'm thinking of unnecessary regu lation, now — it is better not to react too quickly or too severely. Sometimes the best policy is: "Don't just do something, stand there." We must be also aware of what Henry Hazlitt, the financial writer, calls "the fallacy of overlook ing secondary consequences." This is "the per sistent tendency of men to see only the immediate effects of a given policy, or its effects only on a special group, and to neglect to inquire what the long-run effects of that policy will be, not only on March 19 77ß 5</page><page sequence="5">that special group but on all groups." Before we move to make things better, we ought to be sure we won't make things worse. In their recent book entitled, "Regulation and Drug Development," Dr. William Wardell and Dr. Louis Lasagna, made a statement that all of us in research oriented can appreciate. They said "... any legislative or regulatory intervention is an experiment which deserves careful planning of its design and evaluation. We are now at the threshold of larger and bolder legislative and regulatory ex periments . . . We should at the very least acknowl edge the experimental nature of these new policies and act accordingly. Their implementation must be designed as the experiment that it is — with valid controls and systems for measuring the results (against goals) set up in advance. Only in this way can the impact of new legislation and regulation be ascertained." We need more data on which to base decisions. In particular, the federal government should begin to develop, outside the regulating agencies, an un biased program for accumulating substantial medical data to establish air and water quality standards at levels that meet the nation's best inter ests. And a national accident data system would give us all — government and industry alike — the facts that can be used to help determine more ac curately where vehicle safety should be improved. Regulators should be made more accountable. Each agency should be evaluated periodically in terms of how its performance meets its original objectives. And the relevance of these objectives should be reviewed in light of changing national priorities. Regulators should be required to consider alter natives to direct regulation of industry and its products. Economic incentives or disincentives may accomplish the desired end with less cost, less disruption of the free market place and the total economy. Industry must more actively combat existing unnecessary and unreasonable regulation. As many businesses are now doing, all of us should make studies of our own regulatory costs. And we should publish the results widely; let people know what regulations are costing them and what they are getting or not getting for their money. Give govern ment officials facts and figures. By focusing atten tion on these costs we can gain support from con sumers and relief from government. Over a main gate to the General Motors Tech nical Center, is written, "Gateway to Tomorrow." We firmly believe these symbolic words. Industrial research establishments provide the technology on which tomorrow will turn. If research is hobbled by excessive regulation, that tomorrow will be only an extension of today. But, if we work together to achieve necessary, reasonable regulation, that tomorrow will be an exciting one, filled with scien tific advances and technological innovations. 26/Research Management</page></plain_text>
