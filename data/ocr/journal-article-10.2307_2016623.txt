JANUARY 5, 1933 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ON THE EXISTENCE OF A NECESSARY BEING T HOUGH men make gods in their own likeness, the Godhead is not thereby exhausted. For, to evade the difficulties of the problem, " What God is, " by a simple deification of man himself or of some element in Nature, and to deny the existence of the problem, "Whether God is," is but to cut the Gordian knot which intertwines these two problems. Unfortunately for modern thought, this has occurred and the problems remain unsolved. And, though few to- day accept Kant's epistemology, there are many who affirm unques- tioningly that Kant has overthrown forever all arguments for the existence of a necessary, unconditioned Being. And this despite the fact that these same individuals refuse to accept the epistemology on which Kant's arguments are based. In the streams of idealistic thought which flowed from the Critique of Pure Reason as from their source, there formed the notion of the "Absolute," the ideally perfect and infinite whole. But this notion of the Absolute as all-containing was found to be incompatible with any personal pluralism in which individual persons were any- thing more than mere parts of the whole. On the ground, then, that finite selves were relatively independent of the Absolute, the Abso- lute was in turn conceived to be not strictly absolute, but finite. The existence of evil was another stumbling block before the Absolute Idealist. If the Absolute was to be perfect and all-con- taining, it was more than a Herculean task to explain how evil could possibly exist in the universe, in the Absolute. So, from the ethical approach as well as from that of personal pluralism, some modifica- tion of the notion of the Absolute to that of a finite God was neces- sary. Even more direct to the same end was the course of those who at- tached themselves more particularly to the Critique of Practical Reason. For the "practical reason" deals directly with experience. And experience is only of Nature. Then, for God to be knowable He had to be Nature or an element in Nature, hence finite. The Kantian tradition has thus led directly to the notion of a finite God. And, with the acceptance of the notion of a finite God, the problem of the existence of God, "Whether God is," is shunted aside as irrelevant, or, at least, as unimportant. For a finite God 5</page><page sequence="2">6 JOURNAL OF PhIILOSOPHY can be known with ease in the same way as any other element in the universe. Reason has been cast aside; for God is to be found in "'practical reason," in mystic states, in intuition, in religious ex- periences, in one source of knowledge or another, or in some need or affection. The sole important problem is then that of the nature of God. Is He Progress, Love, Value, Service, Nature, Perfection, or some other deified element of Nature? This notion of God as finite has resulted directly from the modern method of procedure, from the "interiority" of modern thought. For modern thought has reversed the traditional order, and begins with the discovery of all objects of knowledge in the epistemological ego, and then attempts, by a sort of epistemological gymnastics, to lift the knower up by his boot-straps, and thereby externalize the objects of knowledge back to the place where they were originally observed, outside of the subject knowing. To argue to the existence of God in this non-traditional spirit, it would be necessary first to enrich the knowledge of the self, and then, if possible, by that means come to a knowledge of the real world and of God. This method of "interiority" has naturally resulted in many vagaries: analyses of subjective elements of knowledge have been erected into metaphysi- cal dogmas without due attention to that other equally important basis of a metaphysics, the analysis of the real objects of knowledge. lThus, those "Interiorists" who fail to externalize their knowledge of the real are the Idealists, and their God is the Ideal Absolute, the perfect and ordered unity of the multiple elements in knowledge. And those "Interiorists" who succeed in externalizing Nature are the Realists, and their God, when they recognize one, is some ele- ment in Nature, or Nature itself. Things have thus been called Gods, but calling a thing God does not make it so. Indeed, if moderns insist on criticizing the traditional notion of God as anthropomorphic, the traditionalist might well reply that the moderns have "theo- morphized" Nature. The traditional philosophic method was one of "exteriority." Thus the Ancients and the Scholastics proceeded from one object of knowledge to another. Metaphysics meant literally "beyond " and "after" physics, it was a study of the real world. And this "ex- teriority" (this analysis of the objects of knowledge) is prior to "interiority" (the analysis of the subjective elements of knowledge) in this sense: the notions and arguments dealing with God and with Nature ought first to be examined on their factual or objective side, i.e., metaphysically, and only thereafter treated epistemologically, in relation to the subject knowing. The traditional notion of God maintains that God is a necessary and self-sufficient Being. God is, Who is. By His very nature God</page><page sequence="3">ON THE EXISTENCE OF A NECESSARY BEING 7 exists. Hence to say that God exists, but could be non-existent, would be self-contradictory, would be contrary to the logical necessity in- volved, for the notion of God is that of a Being that necessarily exists. Though this notion does not in any way prove the existence of God, it does signify that, if God exists, His essence and existence are so closely related that His existence follows directly out of His essence. So that, if any one knows the essence of the necessary Being, he knows also on what account the necessary Being exists. But this traditional notion of God does not imply that of all-con- taining; God is simply self-sufficient and necessary. Therefore per- sonal pluralism, so far from being a difficulty for the traditional niotion of a necessary Being, is one of the premises on which its argu- ment is based. For the notion of necessary Being in no wise implies that persons are mere parts of the whole which is necessary Being. Nor is the universe with its evil in any sense a blot on the perfection of God, for the universe, though dependent on, is distinct from, the necessary Being. The traditional argument of most weight for the existence of God is generally accepted to be that based on the contingency of the universe. It might be stated thus briefly: Consider any existent. It is either (1) unconditioned or (2) con- ditioned. (1) If it is an unconditioned existent, then it is self-sufficient and niecessary, for an ens a se is always an ens necessaritum and vice versa. An unconditioned existent has no external condition for its existence. Then neither can it have any external reason for its existence. But it must have a sufficient reason for its existence. And this suffi- ciency must be within since it is not from without. Therefore an unconditioned existent is self-sufficient. And if self-sufficient, then necessary. (2) In the second alternative, if the given existent be condi- tioned, there still must be an unconditioned being. For all ex- istents can not be conditioned. For, in this alternative that the given existent is conditioned, this conditioned being must have conditions for its existence in such a way as to constitute a series of conditioned existents. Without denying the possibility that this series of conditioned existents might be endless and infinite, the traditional argument maintains that, even though each member of the series causally explains the existence of the member or members dependent upon it, nevertheless the series as a whole, and as containing all conditioned existents, is insufficient to explain its existence as such. The traditional argument maintains that this is true, regardless of the number of members of the causal series, whether the number be finite, or infinite and endless. The</page><page sequence="4">8 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY argument proceeds from the fact that each individual being is con- ditioned by another existent to the fact that each individual being is contingent, not necessary. Hence the series as a whole is con- tingent. But there must be some sufficient reason for the existence of the series as a whole. And this is to be found only in a necessary, self-sufficient being. And if this being is necessary and self-suffi- cient, then it is also unconditioned. It is to be noticed that this unconditioned being is not a first cause in the sense of temporal antecedence; this argument is not con- cerned with the problem of the eternity of the universe. Instead of proving a beginning or creation of the world, this argument attempts to prove only that a necessary, unconditioned being exists as the reason for the existence of all conditioned existents, and thereby satisfies the Principle of Sufficient Reason. If each term of a series is conditioned and contingent, then the series as a whole is condi- tioned and contingent. Though the individual causes explain their individual effects, the contingency of all the causes together remains unexplained. The existence of the entire series is to be explained only by the existence of a necessary being, for the contingent members of the series do not satisfy the Principle of Sufficient Reason. Kant's chief objection to the argument from contingency was based on the notion of totality he employed. He recognized but two types of totality, the empirical totality of a "successive synthesis" and the a priori, transcendental, and subjective synthesis. But, ac- cording to Kant, the notion of "all" as used above in reference to all conditioned existents would be that of an empirical synthesis: "The conception of totality itself is in the present case the representation of a completed synthesis of the parts; and this completion, and con- sequently its conception, is impossible."' Kant explains the two types of "successive synthesis": "I shall term the synthesis of the series on the side of the conditions-from that nearest to the given phenomenon up to the more remote-regressive; that which proceeds on the side of the conditioned, from the immediate consequence to the more remote, I shall call the progressive synthesis. " 2 But the notion of "all" as employed above in our argument is not the totality of successive synthesis as Kant claimed. Nor need it be. The universal of "successive synthesis" is merely the empirical uni- versal of limited extensibility in which we have experienced or can easily empirically verify the totality of the inclusion. "All the words on this page" would be an example of this type of totality. It is this kind of universal which is employed in examples of what has been called perfect induction. There is another type of universal, how- ever, the universal of indefinite extensibility, where the denotation 1 Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, Meiklejohn translation, p. 342. 2 Kant, ibid., p. 328.</page><page sequence="5">ON THE EXISTENCE OF A NECESSARY BEING 9 includes all the members of the class, known or unknown, so long as they answer to the essential characteristics of the class. Practi- cally all our scientific judgments are stated in terms of universals of this kind. Though all existing water has not been analyzed, nor probably ever shall be, all water is H20. And this analysis is valid not only for the water that has been already examined, but for all water whatsoever, wherever it be, so long as it is water. The analysis of all the water in the Pacific Ocean would not make this judgment one fraction more probable. Scientific investigation, in its exam- ination of particular instances, comes to the conclusion that it is the nature of a given thing to be such and such. It then extrapolates beyond the known instances for which it can formulate an empirical universal and states that, no matter how many there be of this type, whether of finite or infinite number, all the members of the class (and not merely those which have been examined) possess certain properties. In cases such as these which define the nature of things, probability does not merely approach a definite goal, but actually attains it. Kant has claimed that the universals of indefinite extensibility are transcendental, good only for the realm of phenomena, and hence are practically subjective. Kant argues that, since this universality is not experienced, it is supplied by a form of the mind, the category of totality. Kant argues further that "'successive synthesis" is pos- sible only in the case of a finite number, that it is impossible in the case of an endless, infinite denotation. For he claims that the con- cept of totality in the case of an endless series is that of successive synthesis, the completed synthesis of the parts; "and this completion, and consequently its conception, is impossible." We admit with Kant that the completed empirical synthesis of an endless series is inconceivable and impossible. But, opposed to Kant, we believe that the universal of indefinite extensibility can legitimately comprise even an infinite series, both collectively and distributively, and that, not by reason of any empirical synthesis, but by reason of the nature of the things examined, by reason of the Uniformity of Nature. And hence this universality is not something merely subjective and tran- scendental, but objective, since it is based on the very nature of things as they exist. Our notion of totality as used in the argument is not that of "successive synthesis." Yet it has objective reference, and can legitimately be used both collectively and distributively. It has just as real a denotation, and is just as much a concrete universal as is any empirical universal, though it does not touch the question of the actual quantity, whether infinite or finite, of the conditioned existents. They may be either of infinite number, or a successive synthesis may be possible. Nor does our notion of "all " bear on the</page><page sequence="6">10 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY question of the spatial limitation or infinity of the universe; nor on the problem, whether the universe had a beginning or is eternal. The solutions of these latter problems are, perhaps, philosophically uncertain. Another alleged difficulty faced by the argument from con- tingency is based on its use of the Principle of Sufficient Reason. Professor Arthur 0. Lovejoy,3 Professor William Savery,4 and the philosophers of emergent evolution in general, raise the question or expressly deny the universal validity of this principle. The Principle of Sufficient Reason of things may be stated: Everything which exists must have a sufficient reason for its existence. The validity of this principle, unlike that of the Principle of Con- tradiction, is not immediately intuited. It is not an axiom. Its validity is conditional on the explicability of things. Everything which exists must have a sufficient reason for its existence, if it is not to be inexplicable.5 The Principle of Sufficient Reason is then based directly on the Principle of Explicability: Everything which exists is by nature explainable. This Principle of Explicability expresses a very firm conviction of all thought. And it is based on the nature of science and of things. The structure of thought is such that it demands an explanation for everything. And the nature of things is such that it corresponds to the veridical explanations of science. All human science seeks, as far as possible, to erect factual verifications and deductive proofs for the relations which exist between things. And a scientific explana- tion is deemed to be true if it corresponds to the ultimate nature of things. In this relation between the nature of science and the nature of things is seen the fact that the laws of science, of thought, are also the laws of things. This necessary assumption, trust, and hope of the intellectual enterprise is fundamental to the possibility, meaning, and validity of science. Science assumes that its expression of facts and laws on the one hand, agrees in the main with the fundamental laws of the world of reality on the other. But this conviction is not an immediately intuited axiom, nor can it be deduced from any more fundamental principle already known as true. It can only be veri- fied by the pragmatic sanction, it works. As in the factual verifica- tions of certain mathematical deductions of Einstein. But the Principle of Explicability in no wise implies that all knowledge is necessarily veridical, nor that science need be capable 3 Cf.

The Heisenberg Principle of In- determinism, for example, does not in the least deny the Principle of Explicability (it is itself an example of scientific explanation) biit merely sets limits to the possibility of exact measurements of velocity, if the position is given, and of position, the velocity being given. And, though science has erred in its explanations at times, these very errors were explanations. The Principle of Explicability signifies merely that the relations between knowledge and things are such that knowledge can express, and at times actually does express and ex- plain, objective facts. The explicability of things is thus limited by its expression (lleisenberg), and by its possibility of error. MIoreover, science does not pretend to have explained all things rightly, but only as- sumes that knowledge is explanatory by nature. These limitations, then, do not invalidate the universal applicability of the Principle of Explicability. But, in recent times, this problem of universal ap- plicability of scientific explanation has been resurrected. Thus, to Lotze's questions, why there is a world at all, and why the content of the world is what it is and not something else, why the world is rnot in rest but in motion, and why motion is in one direction and not in another, Professor Savery replies, "The answer to all of them is: there is no 'why.' . . . Instead of Leibniz' famous dictum, we may say that everything happens without a sufficient reason.... Recently I heard a group of scientists express their dissatisfaction at our not being able to explain the ultimate customs of nature. They had not learned Hume's lesson, which is not that we are unable to explain, but that there is no explanation. . . . That hoary old pseudo-axiom of Aristotle and the Scholastics that the causal stream cannot rise higher than its source belongs to the pathology of human thought. " 6 Professor Savery thus makes an exception to the Principle of Explicability in favor of some of the fundamental problems of philosophy and states that they have no explanation. He then pro- ceeds to offer his own explanation, to state his cosmogony, the cos- mogony of Chance. Similary, for those who postulate a primitive Chaos, it is demanded of that Chaos that it have within it, or out- side of it, some potentiality, some power whereby its development to its present state is explained. Chance and Chaos are themselves ex- planations, hypotheses, which illustrate the fact that it is the very nature of knowledge to explain, and the nature of things to be ex- plained. Without explanation, even philosophy itself has neither validity nor significance. For philosophy is a science. And sciences explain. 6"Chance and Cosmogony," Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association, 1931, pp. 165, 163.</page><page sequence="8">12 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Another premiss of our argument is the observed fact that en- tities existing in the universe are conditioned by other things and events. Consider the paper on which these words are written. This paper would not now exist were it not for the anterior existence of some fibrous substance from which this particular sheet of paper was made. And this fibrous substance could not have grown had the sun not given off its heat, had rain not given the plant sufficient moisture, had it not been for the existence of thousands of con- tributing factors in the history of the universe. Furthermore, this sheet of paper would not exist here and now except for the existence of some individual who operated a certain machine on the day on which this sheet passed through the machine. And these individual things and persons were in turn conditioned in a similar fashion by other individual conditions, both persons and things. So, when we refer to conditions, we are referring to existent things and persons (the sun, plants, rain-drops, workmen, machines, etc., as in the above example) without which any given conditioned existent could not have existed. If the former had not existed, then neither could the latter. As Baldwin defines it, a condition is a "sine qua non, an 'essential' thing or event without which another (conditioned) be- ing cannot be." Though all conditioned existents are contingent existents, we can distinguish between conditionedness and contingency. Conditioned- ness signifies merely the dependence of one being on another for some particular determination or determinations (quality or quali- ties), dependence on other existents for its existence in its present, determined form. Contingency, on the other hand, implies that a being is not necessary, that it does not contain within itself the suffi- cient reason of its existence, that it demands the existence of another existent fully to explain, not its determinations, but the fact that it exists at all. But all conditioned existents are contingent, for, if any existent has or has had external conditions for its existence as it now exists, then that existent is not a necessary, self-sufficient existent, but contingent. The necessity and the unconditionedness of existence are similarly distinct: a necessary existent is one which has within itself, in its very nature or essence, the sufficient reason for its existence; an un- conditioned existent, on the other hand, has no external conditions for its existence. But if any existent has no external condition for its existence, then it must contain within itself the reason for its exis- tence (The Principle of Sufficient Reason). Then any unconditioned existent is also a necessary existent. And vice versa, for if a being exists by its very nature, it does not depend on another being. In the traditional statement of the argument from contingency,</page><page sequence="9">ON THE EXISTENCE OF A NECESSARY BEING 13 as above, the Principle of Sufficient Reason is conceived as demand- ing the existence of a being outside of the series of conditioned ex- istents in order that the fact of their existence might be explained. To this it might be objected that a sort of reification is involved, that the Principle of Sufficient Reason demands only the existence of some inner logical necessity, some law, and not at all the existence of an- other being. Though we believe that the Principle of Sufficient Reason might legitimately demand the existence of a being outside of the series of conditioned beings, we think that the following presentation of the argument, based on the discovery of the neces- sary Being within the series of conditions, avoids this difficulty, in part at least, for the conditions are given as existent. Conisidered distributively, we have observed that some, at least, of the conditions of any conditioned existent are externally condi- tioned. Considered collectively, outside of all the conditions of any condi- tioned existent, there exists no condition. Therefore all the condi- tions of any given conditioned existent must be externally uncon- ditioned. The sufficient reason for the existence of any group of beings must be found either within the group or outside of the group. But the sufficient reason for the existence of all conditions is not outside of the group for there are no conditions outside of all the conditions. Therefore the sufficient reason for the existence of all the conditions, considered collectively, must be somewhere within the group. In other words, the group of conditions must have its self-sufficiency, its necessity, somewhere within the group. We are given, then, that, considered distributively, some at least of the conditions are externally conditioned, and that, considered col- lectively, all the conditions have their self-sufficiency. their necessity, somewhere within the group. There are now but three logical al- ternatives: either this group of conditions is self-sufficient as a group, while each and every individual condition is contingent; or each individual is self-sufficient; or the self-sufficiency of one (or more) conditions is the sufficient reason for the existence of all the con- ditions. The first alternative is impossible, for if all the conditions as a group are self-sufficient, then one, at least, of the conditions is self- sufficient. For contradictory attributes can not be predicated of a group as a group and all the individual members of the group, if the attribute predicated of the group be a positive quality. The second alternative is equally impossible, for some of the con- ditions were given as conditioned; and a conditioned existent can not be self-sufficient, therefore each and every condition can not be self-sufficient.</page><page sequence="10">14 JOURNAL OF PIIILOSOPHY The third alternative then follows, that one (or more) conditions are self-sufficient. But if this existent is self-sufficient, then it is lnecessary; and if it is necessary it is unconditioned. It is an ens necessarium, an ens a se. Following the principle that beings are not to be multiplied without reason, and in view of the fact that there seems to be no important reason why there should be more than one unconditioned being, and in view of the fact that the order in the universe would be more difficult to explain if there were more than one necessary being, it may safely be concluded that there exists one, and only one, unconditioned, necessary Being.
