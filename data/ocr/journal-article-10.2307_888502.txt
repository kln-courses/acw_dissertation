David Nash's amiable monolith in oak, Mizunara bowl (Fig.64), whose avowed calm- ness and attention to the labour of the hand seemed very much at home in the cloisters, was a loser in this respect, especially with a rope barrier set around it; and Anthony Caro's Capital was dwarfed in the foyer of One Canada Square, an ironic result since Caro himself pointed out, many years ago, that no-one had yet devised a sculpture to sit below a skyscraper. An exception was Antony Gormley who, once again, showed his propensity for the theatrical by instal- ling a single recumbent iron figure in a still unoccupied shopping area so that it appeared to float in the empty, morgue-like space. Keith Rand's Originalform, a column of warped and twisted oak panels sited on the edge of the old docks outside the devel- opment, also contrasted well with the tower. Symptomatically, both these artists have provided different sculptures from those 64. Mizunara bowl, by David Nash. Oak (exh. Salisbury Cathedral). they had installed at Salisbury. As many of these works inadvertently demonstrated, the modern office foyer has the ability to reduce sculptures to executive toys, cultural signifiers of prestige and decor but having no meaning. In recent years, this has often seemed to be the case with the work of the American artist, Joel Shapiro, whose large anthropomorphic sculptures, cast in bronze from blocks of wood, have become an ubiquitous essential of the Amer- ican foyer. It was heartening, therefore, to see a survey of his work at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park at West Bretton near Wakefield;3 and further sculptures by him at the New Art Centre, Roche Court near Salisbury (closed 31st August). Both shows demonstrated Shapiro's rich formal devel- opment from the earlier, small house shapes to the large 'figures' and more complex sculptures of recent years. In these two land- scape settings his works seemed stranger and more intriguing as geometries than they do in any office environment.

Brussels James Ensor Although James Ensor cultivated his image as a misunderstood outsider, he has long been established as the central figure of Belgian modernism. During his lifetime he was showered with official honours, and this ambitious exhibition at the Musees royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels (to 13th February), commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of his death, is yet another testament to the privileged position he occupies in his native land. Two hundred of Ensor's paintings are currently displayed in Brussels, alongside some one hundred and fifty works on paper and countless documents, letters and photographs which throw new light on his creative methods. Although this is the most exhaustive retro- spective of Ensor's work to date, the painting that did most to establish his international 65. Skeletons trying to warm themselves, by James Ensor. 1889. 75 by 60 cm. (Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth; exh. Musees royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels). compositions such as the Kimbell Muse- um's Skeletons trying to warm themselves of 1889 (Fig.65) and exquisitely delicate still lifes and seascapes dating from the 1890s, hang side by side with many a flat and empty painting in this enormous show. As he advanced in years Ensor began to parody his earlier style and the brilliant subversiveness of his paint- ing deteriorated into decorative repetition. The exhibition would have benefited from stricter editing throughout, but a token representation would have sufficed in the rooms devoted to the last fifty years of the artist's life. Ensor's best work (like that of several major modernist artists, including de Chirico, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Christian Schad), enjoyed a brief flowering followed by a long decline, and there is no doubt that his reputation would be better served by a more selective exhibition devot- ed to his early years. Ensor's imagination and ambition were sparked by the brilliant constellation of circumstances he encountered in Brussels 66. Scandalised masks, by James Ensor. 1883. 135 by 112 cm.

Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles and appears in the city that inspired its creation only in the ghostly disguise of a large illuminated transparency. To some extent this major disappoint- ment is compensated for by the presence of numerous lesser-known masterpieces. Ensor was a famously contradictory and in- consistent character: wonderfully inventive 765</page><page sequence="2">EXHIBITION REVIEWS decline into alcoholism the artist recorded in his painting of Scandalised masks (1883; Fig.66), Ensor had close ties with England, and he was inspired by British satirical illustrations and by Hogarth. In 1887 he travelled to London to see works by Turner, whose spirit presides over Ensor's own sea- scapes (Fig.68), in which a veil of mystery and glory is cast over the humble seaside town of Ostend. By the mid-1880s, Ensor had evolved a fluorescent palette, partly derived from his studies of light falling on the brightly coloured silks or reflected in the Chinese porcelains and mother-of-pearl shells in his still lifes. Slight slippages in the realism of these compositions gradually led to the figures and masks assuming a strange and alarming life of their own. Ensor was obvi- ously fascinated by the experience of the carnival, which undermined and disrupted the structures of authority that normally governed society. But his satirical masks and skeletons also draw on Flemish tradi- tions and the inspiration he derived, in par- ticular, from Bruegel and Bosch. Given that the present retrospective is staged in the Musees royaux des Beaux-Arts, more could be made of Ensor's specific quotations from pictures in the museum's permanent collec- tion. For example, the figure with the long nose to the left of St Anthony in Bosch's famous triptych ofthe Bemptation of StAnthony is an obvious source for Ensor's masked father in Scandalised masks and for the crotch- ety figure threading her way across a floor strewn with skulls in Ehe astonishment of the mask Wouse (1889). On the rear panels of Bosch's triptych, the scenes of Christ carry- ing the cross, tormented by angry crowds, also struck a deep chord in Ensor, inspiring a whole series of variations in which he explored his own persecution complexes through the theme of the mocked Christ. Ensor's ability to blend national traditions with the themes and styles of international modernism gave rise to his tnost vivid and original paintings. In Bosch and Bruegel he discovered kindred spirits, preoccupied as he was himself with the theme of human vanity. In blackly comical images such as his skeletonised self-portrait of 1889 (Fig. 69), where he gradually replaces his head in the various states of the engraving with a grimacing skull, he too is caught in the cycle of vanity and vanitas that characterised his vision of human fate. But as time went on Ensor lost his self-irony and he was increas- ingly sucked into the game of simulation and dissimulation which he played with his audience. As Sabine Bown-Tavernier remarks in her perceptive essay on Ensor's still lifes in the catalogue,' Ensor's face became increasingly like a mask, while his emotions were invested in the objects with which he surrounded himself. In the 1 880s, Ensor's vulnerability and inspired brilliance were directly expressed in the series of sub- lime drawings and engravings on the theme of Christ mocked, which are dramatically installed in Brussels around the illuminated reproduction of Christ's enty into Brussels. But this degree of self-dramatisation was impos- sible to maintain, and as Ensor retreated behind the 'protective shell' of his masks his decline into self-parody began. 67.

Far from working on the margins of modernism, Ensor found himself at its epicentre when he joined the progres- sive, internationally oriented exhibiting society of L4s XXand won the support of the influential critic, Emil Verhaeren. Travel- ling to Paris in 1884 and 1889, Ensor was very much aware of the innovatory styles of the period and, like other artists of his generation, he began to use light and colour . o as an expresslve torce. During these formative years we find Ensor engaging with the debates about the relative value of observation and imagina- tion which preoccupied his Symbolist peers. Concentrating on portraits and still lifes, he veered between depicting humble kitchen vegetables and the exotic masks, fans and decorative chinoiserie he grew up alongside in the trinket shop run for tourists by his mother's family in Ostend. A decade in advance of Edouard Vuillard, he developed a new kind of psychological realism in his paintings of claustrophobic bourgeois interi- ors where the silent dramas of family life unfold.

By the turn of the century Ensor had also lost his enemies. Several of his most brilliant images such as The intrigue of 1890 and Skeletonsfighting over a hanged man of 1891 (Fig.67) were created at a moment of intense personal crisis, just before Ensor put his studio and all its contents up for sale for the sum of 8,500 francs and found no buyers. From this position he struck out, not only at the critics and ignorant bourgeois public who refused to recognise his genius, but also at doctors, judges, lawyers and any other figures of authority he could find. This polit- ical dimension of Ensor's work was rooted in his personal experience, and as he began to enjoy the fruits of his success he lost his inventiveness and critical edge. Increasingly devoted to his musical compositions, Ensor lived the last years of his long life as the grand, celebrated eccentric he had always aspired to be. JILL LLOYD 'Ensor.

Bonn Philip Guston On leaving the eight galleries that held the mid-sized exhibition of paintings from 1947 to 1979 by Philip Guston at the Kunst- museum, Bonn (closed 1st November),1 the visitor was able to walk straight into several rooms devoted to the German neo- expressionists of the 1970s and 80s. The comparison acted like a prism through which the deep originality of the American artist was refracted. While Guston's pre- cedent was plain enough in the raw figura- tion of George Baselitz, a subtler aftermath ran through the work ofAnselm Kiefer and others. By its far-sighted engagement with such ideas as pastiche, droll irony, fragmen- tation, fear and loathing - not to mention how it took the pulse of an epoch rent by war and the Holocaust - Guston's imagina- tion almost appears to have pre-empted an entire later generation of artists. Because a large U.S. retrospective is planned for 2003, the cardinal sin of the current selection - its choice of the belated date of 1947 at which to broach Guston's career - is easily forgiven. Isolated in a separate triangular space and bereft of the highly significant output that preceded it, The tormentors (Fig.70) of 1947/48 became an especially portentous starting-point. Here we are already at a turning in Guston's progress that also parallels the great cross- roads of abstract expressionism itself. The tormentors, in short, shifts from narrative symbolism to a state that exalts the abstract immediacy of paint, all the while looking back to Braque's late ateliers. That the flat- tened quality of this canvas deceptively suggests relining may be of some import. Forms from Guston's past imagery - shoe soles, a trumpet's bell at lower right or the flail held by a hooded Klansman - are reduced to contours sunk into the brown- black facture. Everything is hieroglyphic, the first of many moments when Guston summons some dark equation between image and script, world and language. The pictures from the early 1950s that followed in the second room were of the kind that helped to establish Guston's signature style as a member of the New York School. However, such stereotyping obscures the fact that in these years Guston was less truly himself than during both the earlier and later phases. For the spell of the chromatic fields of Newman and Rothko or Still's impasto looms large in the 1950 Red painting and Ochre painting I, just as the later Monet advises the tinted mirage of Zone (1953/54). Yet these still manage to be exquisite creations, their ambiguities con- firmed by how they answered the natural lighting from above - blanching when the sun shone, then waxing more intense once it dimmed. Notable, too, is the ongoing pres- ence of signatures on the rectos. Were they possibly tokens of an attitude that refused to banish all vestiges of denotation from the pictorial surface? An aura of presence began to recrudesce in the monumental oils that occupied Guston through the second half of the 1950s. For that reason, their titles seem so apt - The return, Native's return (Fig. 71), The mirror- allusions to the artist's homecoming to the realms of resemblance. The carefully messy brushwork implies 'pure' abstract shapes frayed and pestered by the tug of unruly elements from real life. Colour is also in a rumpus: lush blues and reds quar- rel with opaque grey. It feels as if a painter's joys were up against the grim murk of exis- tence. Throughout the show an occasional work was sited to announce what lay ahead and two items in the third gallery, respec- tively from 1960 and 1962, prepared for the so-called 'dark pictures' that lasted until 1965. Guston remarked of these least ingra- tiating efforts that 'the white pigment is used to erase the black... and so becomes grey .... Sometimes the erasure gets more real to me than the image'.2 Again the implicit metaphor is textual. Then came Guston's implacable rebellion against the 'abstract' side of his own self with the insurgent figuration that dominat- ed the output of the final decade. There was enough of this in Bonn to confirm (if proof were needed) what a tremendous feat it rep- resented, yet too little to satisfy the aficionado. Towards the end of his career, Guston could be said to have emerged as the visual poet of existentialism par excellence. Others had either skirted or lost themselves in this territory - consider how L.S. Lowry and 70. The tormentors, by Philip Guston. 1947-48. 103.8 by 153.7 cm.
