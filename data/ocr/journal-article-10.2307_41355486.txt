<plain_text><page sequence="1">PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY. SEVENTEENTH ORDINARY MEETING. Wednesday, April 13th, 1921. Sir Arthur Duckham, K.C.B., M.Inst. C.E., in the Chair. The Chairman, in introducing Prof. Arm- strong, the author of the paper to be read that evening, said that he had an intimate knowledge of the subject with which he would deal and could speak with authority on it from both the technical and the practical points of view. Another great advantage was that Prof. Armstrong was not biassed on the subject but was trying to arrive at the truth in regard to a matter which he had very much at heart. The following paper was then read : - RELATIVITY AND THE PROBLEMS OF COAL. LOW TEMPERATURE CARBONISATION AND SMOKELESS FUEL. By Professor Henry E. Armstrong, Ph.D., LL.D., D.Sc., F.R.S. He held that the state of England, notwith- standing the superficies of a material prosperity, was one of impending doom, unless it were timety arrested by those who were in high places. * ***** ' Europe is not happy. Amid its false excite- ment, its bustling invention and its endless toil, a profound melancholy broods over its spirit and groans at its heart.

Disraeli : ' ' Tancred. ' ? The aspect of the years that approach us is as solemn as it is full of mystery ; and the weight of evil against which we have to contend is increasing like the letting out of water. Ruskin : ''Seven Lamps of Architecture." These citations are proof that shrewd observers, if not prophets, were abroad in our country so recently as the middle of last century. To-day we are a house entirely divided against itself : we were never more so, never so lacking in sense of proportion and particularly in the faculty of proportionate judgment. God and the Devil seem to be ever present in each one of us and the Devil usually leads ; after all, these two conceptions are but the poetic embodiment in single words of the sum of human experience. Having made unparalleled sacrifices, with that inconsequent obstinacy which is our characteristic, we are now showing unpar- alleled and suicidal selfishness. Leaders with ideals, gifted with sanity and some breadth of outlook, alive to the possibilities and competent to grasp them, are nowhere to be found. We no longer allow such to arise. The race of teachers is at its last gasp of incompetency. Teaching is too entirely in the hands of the learned, who, as Hazlitt has told us, are necessarily ignorant. The University of London will only have parrots. Some drastic means of reform must be found. Disraeli, who foresaw most things and long ago commented- on our neglect of architecture, a subject only recently the topic of discussion, said, that what was wanted in Architecture, as in most things , was a man. To attempt to find refuge in a Committee of Taste would be to escape from the mediocrity of one to the mediocrity of many. "One suggestion might be made - no profession in England had done its duty until it had furnished its victim. Suppose an architect were hanged ? Terror has its inspiration as well as competition. ' ' Suppose a selection made of present leaders not only from the schools but fpom employers and from trade unions and that the chosen were dealt with by some striking lethal process ? The example might at least give rise to thought. Thought of coal can only make one white hot with wrath in these days. Clearly coal is at the root of most of our difficulties : we are suffering severely from a Coalitis brought on by the unreasoned use of it as fuel and gross neglect of the things of the spirit. Are we never to cease from using coal to basé purpose and from making it the cause of our quarrels ? Rather should we weave pure ideals and romance around its use and learn to rate it at its true value. Some halt we must call in the race to destruction ; some organised effort there must be to make knowledge of avail: at present, it seems to be given no part in the conduct of our affairs ; we are governed only by oppor- tunism. As I shall show presently, we are but trying to do to-day with coal what was done successfully a century ago. That science can kill is now fully recog- nised ; few see that it has the power of curing souls ; the fault rests mainly with its priesthood, who are so occupied in looking into the future that they fail to take the most elementary precautions to safeguard their advance. Nothing is more wonderful than the significance of language, the power of the human mind to put meaning into its symbols ; and yet words rarely evoke their proper response. We have little desire to plumb their full meaning. No word in constant use has suffered more from this neglect than has "CoaL" The schools heed it not, the so-called organs of public opinion are in no way concerned to give it vogue ; nothing counts but price per ton. If we were seeing, reasoning beings, we should worship coal as our most pripeless possession - worship it as the greatest of Heaven-sent blessings, those of us who are orthodox ; the rest, in any case, would worship it devoutly, instead of wasting it always. Worship, let me say, has been defined by Carlyle as " transcendent wonder ; wonder for which there is now no limit or measure : that is worship." Such worship Coal deserves. We may become excited over matters of no public consequence - why not over matters that count ? Only recently Science had its Big Gooseberry Season, a virulent</page><page sequence="3">May 6,1921. JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. 387 new German diséase, Einsteinœmia, sudden- ly making* its appearance among mathe- maticians ; a not inconsiderable section of scientific workers was laid low by it ; one week it entirely overcame Nature. The infection was also caught by that most resistant of our institutions, the Press, which as a rule is immune to Science, though often sensitive to Spooks, being in the hands of an opportunist class that knows not Joseph and has no outlook* on the future. The dear old Times was the most severely affected ; but this is not sur- prising, in view of the example it sets, in its special article, at the end of each week, encouraging readers to have faith and say their prayers - at the same time seeking to destroy our faith in the one object of worship that is left to us, our Prime Minister. Suppose The Times were to realise that there are serious subjects to be dealt with and each week devoted a column to Coal ? People would begin to ask - "What is Coal ?" No other material affords the same opportunity of teaching Duty to one's Neighbour. It is at least equal in importance to pigeons. Literary writers are allowed to prose ad nauseam on subjects of no con- sequence - why cannot we recognise that the world now has real needs and that literary tags have lost their value ? " We must seek to deal with what is. The dealers in the ''let it be granted" are a great race, whether they belong to the church or to some other condition of life. By adding a fourth dimension to their speculations, the Einsteinsemics have ex- tended their conceptions of the Universe and have evolved a novel doctrine of Relativity . They would have us modify not a few of our long cherished beliefs ; but it will be safer to suspend judgment. Some of us take the liberty of awaiting proof, before classing speculation as theory : unfortunately we are so Greek-less to-day, that the dis- tinction between hypothesis and theory goes unrecognised. And we have it on no less august authority than that of "Our Scientific Correspondent" in The Times, that the new supra-mundane doctrine is not for ordinary mortals. It is comforting to be told that - 4 4 those who are not advanced mathe- maticians must reconcile themselves to inability to understand Einstein's for- mulae - Einstein uses a geometry of four dimensions and human experience does not contain the materials out of which the imagination can build a picture in more than three. ' ' Our present state would seem to be one of no imagination in any dimension. In effect, the new cult is but a recognition of the fact that "we don't know where we are" in the Cosmos - which is certainly true. Whatever the ultimate fate of the philosophers' dream, it is clear that we have far too long neglected to develop and apply a sound doctrine of Relativity to our sub- lunary affairs. We don't really know where we aro to-day but at most are aware that we are where we are with reference to others and in no absolute sense. Tho opportunism which has so long characterised our actions must make way for some considered course : a dimension, if not a fourth, of organised intelligence, within human comprehension, must be imported into our affairs. Time was, centuries ago, when the nations led an isolated existeдce and were happy according to their lights. Unfortunately certain restless individuals, who in the good old days would have been knocked on the head - very properly - as disturbers of the peace, instead of saying as their father» had done, 44 1 don't think," began to whisper "I know." A magic password came into their possession and they were able to forge an entirely new key - the experi- mental method : armed with these and infi- nite courage and perseverance, they were able to unlock the caves of knowledge, to penetrate far and wide into their utmost ramifications and to discover an astounding treasure. Why is not their story listened to everywhere ? Surely, if Chu Chin Chow can be played nightly, during five years, to crowded houses, by characters clad in colours from coal, if we had any histrionic talent among us, we should stage a far more entrancing drama dealing with King Coal himself. The new Wizards have relentlessly mouthed their "Open Sesame" during a century or so. Their key -word has been simply "Science" - but the modern Ali Baba, who has battened on their findings, loads his poor stupid ass with the electric telegraph, railroads, steamships and cannon. The forty thieves behind him began by taking toll of the Sun's ancient hoard of black diamond and flashed the Jewel most arrogantly the wide world o'er. As do all who acquire a fortune beyond dreams of avarice, Ali Baba and his friends have</page><page sequence="4">388 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS May 6, 1921. squandered in every direction. Unfor- tunately they have shared their plunder with the multitude and as a consequence morals have been abrogated universally. Worse stilly all the peoples have been brought into competition and conflict. Our earth can now be so swiftly encompassed with a girdle that national independence is no more. The recent war was but the in- evitable consequence of an overwhelming confidence bred of the scientific uses to which Nature's hoard may be put - of a confidence without touch of altruism, let alone understanding. The writing on the wall was never more ominous. It is clear that our civilisation is not even skin deep ; that it takes little to bring the elemental man to the surface ; that he is ever ready to see red. "With all their enormous differences in natural endowment, men agree in one thing aňd that is their innate desire to enjoy the pleasures and to escape the pains of life ; and, in short, to do nothing but that which it pleases them to do, without the least reference to the welfare of the society into which they are born. That is their inheritance (the reality at the bottom of the doctrine of original sin) from the long series of ancestors, human and semi- human and brutal, in whom the strength of this innate tendency to self-assertion was the con- dition of victory in the struggle for existence. That is the reason of the insatiable hunger for enjoyment of all mankind, which is one of the essential conditions of success in the war with the state of nature outside ; and yet the sure agent of the destruction of society if allowed free play within. ' ' Evolution and Ethics. Huxley's Collected Essays, Vol. IX. The verdict of science must be against those who foreshadow an alteration of our nature : the records of the past are proof to us that it has little if any structural plas- ticity and it is obvious that education cannot modify us materially. If we were in any degree plastic, we should not be what we are ; no type would be long preserved. The implastic races are those that are likely to survive. Only by the application of breeding methods, consciously or unconsciously, can we produce a change. Such change is proceeding but in the wrong direction. Mephistophelian science garbed as humanity is everywhere encouraging the propagation of the unfit and promoting their survival : the lesson taught by Darwin is nowhere regarded. War, instead of strengthening the race, has deprived us of our best stock* The intellectual man is fast being taxed out of existence - he cannot afford to breed. The intellectual woman is now seeking for man's scalp in every direction and through education is lowering her domestic attrac- tions, even her human desires. Raisers of stock know f#ll well that the consequences must be : good milkers cannot be bred from a milkless herd. Chemists, perhaps, more than any other class of worker are entitled to pronounce an opinion on these matters, in view of their intimate knowledge of ultimate structure and of the structural peculiarities of living matter as influencing function : all modern work tends to show that we are largely the creatures of a chemical control. Mr. Wells, who clearly should have been a Bishop - he has all the qualifications of a cleric, including those of a complete self- esteem bordering on infallibility - would have all the peoples united in one great World State : but having proved that he cannot feel the pulse of the past* he need not be taken seriously as wearer of the prophet's mantle. Nominally, Mr. Wells received a scientific training; actually, it may almost be said of him, as was said of Mr. Gladstone by Herbert Spencer, that he is the type of the unscientific mind - a dreamer. It is clear that the lessons of anthropology and of history are without meaning to him - otherwise he could not contemplate the peaceful browsing together everywhere of the lions and lambs of the earth. In the past the peoples were happy because they were apart ; but the black diamond has demoralised all but savage societies - and the missionaries account for these. Mr. Wells would have the Americans believe that the railways came as an un- qualified blessing to the United States. Actually they have ministered to human i selfishness and greed in the most deplorable manner possible - a vast continent has been depleted of its natural resources within three or four generations in an inconceivably ruthless and inconsiderate manner : the great oilfields, opened up only about 60 years ago, will be worked out, we are told, within less than a century. The country has been peopled, not by a natural process but by overflow - it has, in the main, served * See Mr. Wells as Historian. "An inquiry into the facts of Mr. H. G.

JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. 389 as the safety valve of the European con- tinent and the Asiatic overflow is now seeking entry. The sway of the black diamond over the American continent has therefore ministered to the undue multiplication of populations in Europe. In this country, we know, there has been an enormous increase of population «ince the so-called industrial revolution set in. Some halt must be called. In the near future, if we have any regard for coming needs, the present efficiency of coal -using appliances must be quadrupled and only half the amount raised : then at most half the number of miners that is now employed will find occupation in the industry. America will not always swallow up the surplus of other nations - the moral is clear. A true doctrine of Relativity should enable the nations to define and preserve their respective positions. The opportunism which has so long characterised our actions should give way to some considered course. So long as coal can be had at prices at which it can be used we must remain united in one inharmonious whole - and put up with each other's interference as best we may ; but the wand of Science is now passing into the hands of the East. An we be not careful, world-wide quarrels may easily arise. Recent publications on the "Conflict of Colour" are of absorbing interest in this connection. Apart from coal, sooner or later, if we encourage the growth of populations at modern rates, the struggle for food will be unavoidable. Few see what are the govern- ing and limiting factors of supply. More than once I have pointed out from this platform, that we must take heed of the rapidly growing depletion of the stores of phosphate - this and potash, rather than coal, are perhaps the limiting factors of the world's advance. Science hitherto has been used chiefly on the side of competitive industry and on that of sentiment, in entire disregard of the main principles of evolutionary doctrine. We have far to go before we make right application of our modern pass-word - to school ourselves against the ignorance and false sentiment which bar our way to the provident use of the materials won from the cave of knowledge. The world needs a new religion - it may well find one in the recovery of the most ancient of all, that of Sun Worship, by making Coal the chief object of reverence. Unfortunately, though ever glad to bask in it^ beams, we have not even the savage's wonder at its might - our children are in no way taught to understand and glory in their dependence upon its lustre ; or to realise that they are not merely warmed and cheered by it but fed with its aid ; or to rejoice in their heritage of coal, as witness of the Sun's considerate activity on their behalf in the far distant past : to see that it is their Capital. The more we penetrate into the mystery of the Universe, the more marvellous it becomes. Speculation has long been rife as to the origin of the Sun's heat. Now we are beginning to think of our luminary as constituted not of elementary materials as we know them but largely of the finer materials of which these are composed : in fact, we are beginning to think of matter as built up of atoms of electricity - electrons - and the Sun's output of energy as largely generated in the gradual building up of the elements from these finer constituents. - The Sun's rays, falling on the plant, enable it to grow at the expense of the carbonaceous food presented to it in the atmosphere - only to the extent of 3 parts in 10,000. Eating plant food, we are able to utilise the car- bonaceous building-stones fashioned in the plant, with the aid of solar energy, from air, earth and ^vater ; hence we are heirs of our Sun. Much of the carbon assimilated by plants in the far distant past has been preserved to us as coal. So that in coal we may read an epic with which none that is written in books can compare. The Scribes, let alone the Pharisees, have nothing to offer which can be set against this know- ledge - and yet we make no use of it in our system of education. At the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Belfast, in 1902, we were entertained by one of the Clubs at a Smoking Concert. A programme was provided with illustrations topical of tit-bits from the Sectional Addresses. Among them was one of a literary man sitting on the floor gazing blankly at a coal-scuttle, with the script, "A scuttle full of coal excites no emotion in the literary mind'* (Professor Armstrong). The artist of to-day might well take our Minister of Education as his model of the literary man. In no speech of his have I ever noticed a refer- ence either to coal or to the Sun - yet he has had much to say of the value of</page><page sequence="6">390 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS May 6, 1921. reading. A Minister who has thought some meaning into the things of life and will advocate attention being paid to them in the schools has yet to be found. Let us hope that one of the numerous Coal Controllers of the past, if not Mr. Smillie, will be offered the office at the next vacancy. Whatever be behind the veil, so much of her secret has now been torn from Nature that science can give no credence to the crude and selfish anthropomorphic inter- pretations of the past. Unfortunately, mankind is weighted with mental disa- bilities acquired in a superstitious period of long duration, now perhaps inseparable from his structure ; but at least he can be taught that, in the long run, the safety of his skin wTill only be secured if he make proper use of the opportunities at his disposal. The future of civilisation depends on our right use of coal and all must learn to treat it with respect. It must be an object of transcendent wonder to those who can in any way picture its story and realise its potentialities, who can grasp the fact that its main component is the basal unit of our own structure and that the mosaics of that structure, to the all-seeing eye of the chemist, are of patterns of a most exquisite, ordered beauty but at the same time of extraordinary fixity of design, administrate of an iron purpose. The problems of coal cannot be dealt with simply or by any one interest in an effective manner. In no other field of action is co-operation so essential to success - the tasks are beyond the power of individ- uals ; there must be a combination of forces - many heads now unwilling to approach must be knocked together. We have to consult convenience as well as aim at economy. Smoke Prevention. Not a halfpenny should be spent, not a minute wasted, in further inquiry into the "Smoke Nuisance". Such inquiry can only be futile. Legislation will be impossible until we have approved means of preventing smoke. Much has been said of late as to the need of introducing Art into common life. As Mr. Newton has pointed out, in a recent letter in The Times (March 30), the move- ment can have but little result unless we get rid of smoke. He paints the effect of smoke in lurid terms but there is nothing new in his recital. The degrading story has been told over and over again - yet no one does anything. The only possible solution is to use smokeless fuels. Smokeless fuels are of two kinds, gaseous and solid. Each has its special advantages, each its disadvantages. I believe we need to use both in our domestic life ; they are natural partners and can be made mutually helpful. History will but be repeated should their correlative and balanced use be secured in the early future ; they were in use together a century ago but the one has long since been improved into oblivion and the other is now a hopeless weakling. The foundation of the Gas Lighting Industry is to be dated back to an experi- ment made by one William Murdock, in his backyard, in 1792. Heating coal in an iron pot, he caused the gas which was given off to pass through a pipe into his house and burnt it as a domestic sacrifice at the altar of coal - but the public, having no regard for symbols, never puts significance into the flame. Murdock's invention, as is well known, was gradually developed, first at Boulton and Watts' Soho Works, at Birmingham. In 1810 an Act of Parliament was passed authorising the formation of a Statutory Company to supply London with the new gas. Two years later, the Company became known as the Gas Light and Coke Company ; though existent to-day, the Company has never more than half justified its name and the splendour of its flame has steadily diminished with the years. Most interesting particulars of the industry were published in 1819 by Frederick Accum, well known as the author of several chemical works and, I believe, at one time, an assis- tant to Sir Humphry Davy. The coal was carbonised in cast iron retorts, preferably of cylindrical shape - about 2 bushels of coal, in a layer 5 to 8 inches thick, per retort. Apparently they were worked at about a cherry -red heat, probably not exceeding 700° -750° C. The carbonising period was from 6 to 8 hours ; but Accum gives details of several series of trials, carried out at the Westminster , station, to ascertain the best time of heating, from which the conclusion was drawn that 8 rather than 6 hours was the preferable period. The average yield of gas in these trials varied from 8300 to 10,000 feet per chaldron (27 cwt.) of coal- say 6150 to , 7400 cubic feet per ton. From the balance</page><page sequence="7">¡May 6, 1S21. JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. 391 sheets quoted by Accum, it appears that the coal cost £2 lis. 6d. per chaldron; the coke sold at £1 7s. Od. per chaldron and the gas at 15 shillings per thousand cubic feet. It is clear that the gas will have been rich and the coke not very hard. Accum writes with extraordinary en- thusiasm of the use of gas both as an illu- minating and as a heating agent. Mr. Maiben had ascertained, he says - 4 4 that gas from coal gives nearly the same heat when put into combustion which is yielded by a third part of the coal from which it is extracted. "There are no coals to be carried in, no ashes to be carried out ; there is no blowing, no sweeping of cinders, no dust, no interruption of servants ; there is no excessive heat in one stage, no sudden clamping at another ; we have the choice of any temperature which we can regulate with the utmost ease. The fire itself is lively and pleasant to the eye ; inclosed in transparencies it receives a degree of splendour not easily imagined. ' ' Evidently gas was gas in those days ; and as to the Coke- "The coal is so far from being reduced in consequence of the gas-light process, to an useless mass, that in many places immense quantities are reduced to the state of coke for the purpose of rendering the coal a better fuel than it was in its natural state ; for coke gives a strong and lasting heat. It is equally valuable for kitchen and parlour fires and still more as a necessary requisite in some important branches of manufacture, so that in whatever quantity coke may be produced, it can never want a good market. The demand for coke in this capital, since the establishment of the gas-light works, has prodigiously increased. Num- erous taverns, offices and public establish- ments which heretofore burnt coal, now use coke to the total exclusion of coal ; and in almost every manufactory, which requires both extensive lighting and heating, gas and coke are now the means jointly employed. A coke fire emits a very uniform and intense heat ; it produces no sparks and burns free from soot and smoke. ' ' Why, a century ago, when soft coke became available, did people turn from coal to this new material ? Surely because it was a clean, honest fuel, not a dirty one. They would do so again to-day for the same reason, if the chance were given - nay, more, no one would object to the use of such fuel being made compulsory, the smoke nuisance is now so terrible in its effects. Why is coke gone out of general use as a fuel ? Because neither Science nor Rel- ativity has troubled the gas engineer ; he has simply concentrated his attention on producing and piping gas. When the demand for gas grew and it was necessary to cheapen the supply, the temperature of carbonisation was raised, so as to produce a larger volume of gas. So long as iron retorts were used, little could be done ; but as soon as fire clay retorts were successfully introduced, it became possible to raise the heats very considerably. More gas was obtained, it is true ; but the coke became useless for domestic purposes, too much burnt-out to kindle easily and give a cheerful fire in an ordinary grate. The' rot set in 60 to 50 years ago - from that time on the quality of gas was steadily reduced : a curious losing race between gas and burner took place ; whilst burners were greatly improved, gas was reduced in illuminating efficiency and heating power, as the Companies were allowed to use the better burners in testing it. Protests were made on behalf of the public by my old chief, the late Sir Edward Frankland - but without effect. At the time of the panic consequent on the intro- duction of electric light, the gas industry came near to death's door and was only saved by the introduction about five and twenty years ago of the Auer von Welsbach mantle - which not only made intrinsic illuminating poweï of secondary conse- quence but permitted a gas of low heating power to be used with effect. Now the gas companies are cheerfully carting considerable quantities of atmospheric nitrogen about in their mains - not merely running ill -fill ed trains but putting stones in place of the passengers who should be forthcoming. Ours is an age of progress, something must be forced to move. My interest in coal and gas dates far back. A student under Hofmann, Frankland and Kolbe, I naturally gave special attention to organic chemistry. Kolbe introduced me to Phenol in 1868 : I have always maintained the greatest affection for this my first coal- tar love ; there is no more engaging minx among one's chemical sweethearts. No lecture course ever made so great an im-</page><page sequence="8">392 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. May 6, 1921. pression on me as did that of Frankland delivered in 1867, at the Royal Institution, in which he demonstrated his views on the origin of light in flames. I increased my acquaintance with the Phenol family during the seventies and found them a charming group. Then I was led tò turn my attention to the manufacture of gas from oil and especially to the By-products, thus entering upon a neglected line of inquiry opened up by Faraday in 1825. Accum has a chapter on 4 4 Gas from Oil," which is copied from ' the Journal of this Society (VI, p. 108). It is noteworthy that, in those early days, gas from oil was supplied compressed into portable vessels which were the fore- runners of those in which hydrogen, oxygen, acetylene, etc., are now purveyed ; and that, four years hence, we must celebrate the laying of the foundation stone of the Coal- tar Colour Industry a century ago, in the Royal Institution, Albemarle Street, by Faraday, through the discovery of benzene in the liquid produced on compressing oil -gas. To judge, however, from the recent events, especially from the military occu- pation of the Directorate of our Government enterprise, it ife not improbable that, by that time, there may be no Coal Tar Colour Industry left in the country and that we shall but be doing honour to the pious founder - of German industry. In 1885, I ventured to address the Iron and Steel Institute on the recovery of the matters latent in coal, as completely as possible and in the most economical and advantageous manner and form. In con- cluding my brief harangue, I pointed out - 4 4 that we know practically nothing of what happens when coal is distilled or of the conditions most favourable to the production of the valuable constituents of tar. Until we possess adequate know- ledge on these points, the coking of coal and the manufacture of gas from coal and oil are empirical operations and cannot be scientifically conducted. It would not be difficult to gain the required information but the aid of the chemist must be sought and the experiments must be on a moderately large and therefore expensive scale. Our private dabbling with tars from various sources can never lead to a really satisfactory result. The interests involved are so great, the subject is one of such national importance, that failure to initiate and execute the necessary systematic experi- ments without further loss of time is simply inexcusable. ' ' * Of course nothing came of this appeal to the myopic vision of coal owners and coal users. The late Prof. Vivian B. Lewes, in his Cantor Lectures on Fuel and its Future, delivered before this Society in March, 1908, calling attention to a paper read before the Society of Chemical Industry, twenty-two years previously, by Mr. Lewis Wright^ under the title, 4 4 What shall we do with our tar ? ' ' remarks, that - ' ' In the discussion that followed the paper Dr. Armstrong asked the pertinent questions - Was the gas maker right in his present method of treating coal ? Would it not be better to deal with it so as to produce a large proportion of residuals and a different class of coke ? In the twenty -two years that have elapsed since these questions were asked, the gas managers of the country have not only ignored them but have, with self- complacent egotism that brooked no interference, worked in the exactly oppo- site direction. ' ' Being a patient soul, realising that nothing short of a deluge could wash out an intelligent interest from the mountains of prejudice, I continued to dabble with tars but said nothing more - until 1908, when I could contain myself no longer and again turned to the Iron and Steel Institute. I need only quote the opening lines of my communication - 4 4 There must be not a few at the present time who find it difficult to remain calm, when they reflect on the ruthless way in which the world's accumulated stores of raw material, especially of fuel, both coal and oil, are being used up ; who shudder when they notice the indifference displayed in all civilised lands to the consequences which must accrue from such waste in by no means distant times to come. ' ' The consequences are with us to-day. In 1910 and again in 1913, I initiated discussion on the provident use of Coal at the meetings of the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Sheffield and Birmingham. These towns were not to be stirred. My advocacy of smokeless fuel in 1910 was qùietly scoffed at by the * Note with reference to the methods proposed for coking coal and recovering volatile matters.

I sought to awaken a coal conscience at a Conference in Cardiff early in 1915, later in the same year at Manchester, at New- castle in 1916 and at Nottingham in 1917. There was great hullabaloo on this last occasion - but only because, copying Disraeli, I suggested that a little lynching might do good. The purists of the Society of Chemical Industry were so lacking in sense of humour that they would not allow the publication of my joking remarks. Short of going to the stake or hanging myself - more appropriately, perhaps, taking coal-gas - I could do no more. Others have had no greater success. My final appeal must be to Cassar here. To repeat words I used at a recent Conference at the Efficiency Exhibition at Olympia : • It is to the lasting disgrace of the coal owners that they have not moved a finger to improve coal for public use, so that full value might be got out of it. It is to the lasting disgrace of the great users of coal that they have done nothing, either collectively or individually, to inquire into methods of avoiding the great waste involved in the use of raw coal. Sheffield, to take an instance, for years past, has been a disgrace to our civilization : nowhere else has there been such culpable waste of coal. Production of Smokeless Fuel. It has been left to the business promoter and visionary to save the situation. Though absolutely unscientific and liable to be misled by their agents, workers of this class are human and their ways therefore appeal to human nature, whilst the cold calculations of science pass unnoticed ; and being free from professional limitations, seeing the promise and not the difficulties, they are enterprising and hopeful. We constantly blame their methods and they sometimes mislead us badly ; but these Mark Tapleys of the world have often intervened with success and unless Relativity be made to count in our affairs, it will be long before we shall do without their assistance. The history of the solid fuel enterprise I propose to deal with, as far as I can gather it from scattered items of information, is briefly as follows. It is a chequered story, one showing up the petty behaviour of vested interests and the" extraordinary narrowness of vision of our industrial leaders. Two men chiefly have been concerned in the invention - I use the term "in- vention" advisedly, as the fuel I am about to speak of is a novel and distinct product of a kind unknown prior to 1905 - Mr- F. W. Salisbury -Jones, who throughout has been the moving spirit ; and the late Mr. Thomas Parker. The former began his career under Rhodes, in South Africa, hence his invincible optimism and dash. Mr. Parker, who was born in 1843, commenced life in the Coalbrookdale Iron Works and began by lighting the fires for the men at half -past five in the morning - so his attention was early directed to fuel. In 1881, he designed the house grate known as the Kyrie, winning the first medal offered by the newly formed Coal Smoke Abate- ment Society. Leaving the Iron Works, he entered the Engineering trade. In 1878 he designed and built a Dynamo for use in the electro-deposition of metals. He then entered into partnership with Mr. Elwell ; the firm was well known in the early days when Ayrton, Perry and I were witnesses of the birth and rapid growth of the Elec- trical Industry consequent on the intro- duction of the electric light and then of electric traction. Mr. Parker was a man of great originality and full of scientific enthusiasm. In 1900, he was engaged on plans for the electrification of the Metropolitan Railway in London, which was afterwards carried out under his direction ; Mr. Salisbury -J ones with his brother was busy in developing the Motor Bus. The two pioneers often came together ; meeting at the fireside, at a time when the smoke nuisance was the subject of constant complaint, they began to discuss the possibility of producing a solid fuel,, which would burn easily and cheerfully as a clear fire does without producing smoke, by subjecting coal to a treatment similar to that to which it undergoes in an ordinary fire - i.e., carbonising at a relatively low temperature. The electrification of the Metropolitan Railway was complete in 1905 and the- Motor Bus industry was well on its feet at about the same time. Mr. Parker and Mr. Salisbury- Jones then entered upon the spceial study of the problem they had formulated in their minds : the experiments were carried out at Wednesfield near Birmingham, where Parker had made preliminary trials in 1908. It is of importance to note that, in the</page><page sequence="10">Ш JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOC1KTY OF ARTS. May 6, 1921. first experiments, a tube three inches wide, perforated with holes, was filled with coal and fired inside a larger "retort," to the point at which illuminating gas ceased to be given off. The result was most satis- factory- -the fuel was compact, so that it would withstand handling and carriage ; it was not only easily kindled but burnt readily in an ordinary grate, giving the cheerful fire required. The coal had been -carbonised under pressure, as it were, whilst the volatile matter could escape freely. The need of carbonising in such a way seems to have been generally overlooked - hence the impression abroad subsequently, when the new fuel began to be discussed, that low temperature Gas Works coke was a similar product. In the earliest large scale trials, tapered, wrought iron cylinders were used, closed with perforated caps ; these, 1 am led to believe, were about 5 feet long. Such cylinders, 10 to 12 inches in diameter, are referred to in Mr. Parkers' patent specifi- cation (No. 14365, 1906), where the impor- tance of filling them with coal is emphasised. The cylinders were heated in a flat bottomed reverberatory furnace ; they were introduced at the one end, gradually rolled to the other and then taken out, fresh ones being intro- duced as they were removed. He soon passed to vertical carbonising vessels, heated a¿ll round. One of the earliest ovens was made 12 feet high, 4 feet across and 12 inches wide at the bottom, tapering to 8 inches at the top ; this was built up in sections bolted together. A set of four of these was worked but the charge was too thick and became overheated on the outside and insufficiently within ; also the coked mass stuck badly. At an early date Mr. Parker cast the retorts of an inverted V shape ; at first, they were made about 3 feet high, 6 feet broad and tapered from 3 inches at the top to 4 J inches at the bottom ; but ultimately the dimensions were increased up to 12 to 14 feet high, 11 feet long and the tapering from about 3J to 7 -A inches. A satisfactory thickness - about 3/8ths of an inch - was arrived at only after many trials. Some Were cast with plain, some with corrugated sides. He also tried long, tapering vertical tubes and obtaining good results proceeded tó cast a dozen of these together in two rows of six, eafch 6 inches in diameter at the top and about 12 feet long. He was indifferent as to thickness, thinking that heat would travel easily through iron. A plant was built of 24 of these units ranged side by side and occupied an area only 20 x 40 feet ; this gave an output of 40 tons of the fuel per diem. I myself saw this plant in opera- tion. Initially castings were obtained from out- side but these proved to be so unsatisfactory that Mr. Parker became his own founder, utilising his early experience in an iron works ; much of his success appears to have been due to this circumstance but, on the other hand, the mania he developed for casting seems to have led him to neglect other essential factors. Thus he never gave adequate attention either to the oven- bottom or to letting down and cooling the heated charge. He was undoubtedly hampered' by his lack of gas engineering experience ; like so many inventors before him, he was overcome by an all -convincing belief in his idea and in his ability to solve it alone ; he certainly obtained very remark- able results. The new smokeless fuel was registered as Coalite in 1906 and was very widely adver- tised. A syndicate was also formed to pro- vide the further funds required for the prosecution of the inquiry, necessarily a very expensive one. The foundry was extended and the plant increased. The results were so satisfactory that it was decided to form a larger * Company - to purchase the patent rights, the Wednesfield ground and plant and a property at Barking for new works. Let me here quote a dead witness, the late Prof. Vivian B. Lewis (Cantor Lectures on Fuel, 1908), as to the position at this time. "The idea being taken up and vigorously pushed in the City resulted in the forma- tion of a Company and the shock which the amour proj&gt;re of the gas industry received at finding amateurs gravely proposing to show them how coal should be carbonised roused in them a feeling of rabid resentment which was admirably reflected in the articles of the leading gas journals." Any one who takes the trouble to read the Press notices of Coalite in 1907 will realise that this is a mild description of the virulence displayed in interested quarters. Far worse was the direct action taken by the Gas Light and Coke Co. in issuing the following advertisement (in June, 1907) : -</page><page sequence="11">May 6, 1921. JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. 395 CARBO The Gas Light and Coke Company's NEW SMOKELESS FUEL. Made in ordinary Gas Retorts. Clean to handle. Lights readily in the ordinary grate without the assistance of coal. Quickly attains a state of Incandescence. Gives out great Heat. Is absolutely Smokeless. This advertisement was fatal to the proposed company and most seriously crippled the enterprise. "If the new fuel could be made at any moment by the Gas , Co's., why form a new Company ? ' ' was the argument. As a matter of fact Carbo was found out by the Public within a year and the Gas Companies never became purveyors of a fuel comparable with Coalite. Gas Companies Coke was long a drug in the market and was selling at 9/- per ton just before the war in 1914 ; but the effect remained - Coalite was discredited. However, the Company was formed and a plant was erected at Barking, the w7orks at Wednesfield was extended and plants were erected at Plymouth and Ну the. At least 100,000 tons of Coalite were made at the different works. Much of it was magnificent in quality. One of my oldest friends, a chemist and a judge of fuel, I well recollect was enthusiastic over it at first but afterwards dissatisfied. Reminding him of this, he has just given me a sample which he put aside in 1906 or 1907. I have not yet myself seen anything so good produced. Every variety of coal seems to have been tested and here a mistake was made. The early advertisements promised a fuel low in ash and that first produced was of this character ; unfortunately, in the desire to show that all coals could be made into fuel, much unwashed coal full of ash was used : naturally users were not pleased with the product. Then some of the Coalite put on sale was very like ordinary coke, through being overheated. Unfortunately, after about two years, the battery of iron retorts at Wednesfield became distorted - too slim in the waist - and the carbonised fuel could not be dis- charged without forcing : I imagine that the iron began to "grow" through oxidation. This led to the production of a very high percentage of Breeze or Smalls. The best way of getting over this difficulty appeared to be to substitute firebrick for iron but the funds to make the change were wanting ; none the less experiments were begun in this direction. Although the enterprise, on the whole, failed to meet with support here, the Germans were more alive to its value. Early in 1913, a big German Coking Interest made the proposal that, provided they were satisfied with it after a year's trial, they would join with the Coalite Company in developing the process. An agreement was entered into and a most striking contribution to the process was soon made by the Germans,, as they sent over a retort, similar to the smaller V-shaped retorts that had been made in iron by Mr. Parker, cast whole in fire clay. Here, in the backward state of our refractories industry, the feat was impossible and probably is still. The Germans were satisfied with the trials they witnessed and eventually sent over a staff to start work on the erection of a complete plant : shortly after their arrival came the* war. Mr. Parker retired in 1914, entirely dis- heartened, feeling that the opposition of the gas interest had made success im- possible. He died in 1915, as did also Prof. Vivian B. Lewes, who had been intimately associated with him in the Wednesfield inquiry from the beginning. With these two men perished most of the fruits of knowledge gained at great expense- over a long period of years. Such has too often been our experience in the past- The mistake made was in allowing Mr- Parker to work apart : whilst too many cooks spoil a broth, the preparation of a banquet needs a number ; but the inventor is a jealous creature and naturally attaches an exaggerated value to his idea and is not sufficiently alive to his limitations. Experiments at Barnsley. To pass now to my own experience of the process. I knew of it only from hearsay up to 1908. Some time in that year, the then Chairman of the Company, the late Sir Wm. Preece, F.R.S., who was long the chief Electrician of the Post Office, whom I met not unfrequently at our Club, the Athenaeum, invited me to join him in a visit to the works at Wednesfield. I did so and paid a second visit, perhaps a year later. At that time I gave no special heed to the fuel side of the problem : but the</page><page sequence="12">:î96 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. May 6, 1921. plant referred to on page 394, described in The Times of October 27th, 1908, was in operation and I saw several charges dropped ; I remember that it was necessary to force some of them down. I was more concerned with the tar, which I knew must be unlike ordinary Cías Works Tar, so spent my time mainly in trying to ascertain what had been learnt about this product of the process and -arranging that suitable samples of the crude material might be put at my disposal for study. The 4 'Chemist" in •charge was one whose soul had not risen much above the extraction of carbolic acid from the tar and my efforts to extract information were generally foiled in the way that has not infrequently been experienced by the 4 4 Professor" in the past, when he has visited a works - only to be viewed with suspicion. I formed the impression that this part of the work was of the usual empirical order. Much work was done with the tar in my laboratory and in opening the discussion on "The Provident Use of Coal" in Sheffield in 1910, I gave an account, in general terms, of my results. Sir William Preece falling ill, I heard little more of the enterprise until after the publication of my Newcastle paper on "The Problems of Coal with reference to the complete and provident utilisation of the supplies and of fuels generally : a pre- liminar}^ discussion and scheme," read February 19th, 1916, in the Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry, in which I had referred to Coalite. I received an ' invitation to visit the office of the Coalite Co. to inspect the plans of works then in course of erection. I was shown a most impressive set of working drawings of a plant to be erected near Barnsley (Yorks) : I could get little explanation of their origin but it seemed to me, at the time, that they savoured largely of German inspiration in their minute elaboration. However, being no judge of paper plans, I asked to see the works and was granted the privilege of visiting them at frequent intervals. I had, at this time, realised the enormous potential value of the process as a source of oil fuel and was anxious to render what help I could. When T first went down, little more than the foundations were laid : progress was exas- peratingly slow under the conditions which then prevailed, as skilled labour was scarcely to be had ; and delivery of material was very slow. The most distressing of the many object lessons the works afforded was the inferior quality of the refractory materials : few if any of the bricks supplied for the construction of the ovens were of specified size and it was necessary to grind and shape them before use : one felt that much of the strength was being taken out of them; fmd the cost was great. I was present during the first few days when carbonisation was begun and on numerous later occasions. It was soon obvious that no one of the staff had had any previous experience of the process and that the experience gained by Mr. Parker had been cast to the winds ; it was also clear that an exceptionally intelligent set of men was required to work so complex a plant : it soon appeared that most serious errors of construction had been made. The large inverted V-shaped ovens were gas fired, by means of numerous burners fixed one above the other. No scrubber was provided to remove dust and tar from the gas as it issued from the Mond Producer. Consequently, the burners were constantly clogged by tar and the regulation of the heats was very difficult. A refined and most costly machine had been constructed for the discharge of the ovens. This was a carriage running on rails, provided with two rams which could be electrically driven by a dynamo on the carriage. These rams were to be moved up and down through two tall boxes, so as to bring down the charges from the ovens above into these boxes, where the hot coke was to be cooled off by the external application of a water spray projected at the sides of the box by a small pump on the carriage. The "expectation was that the charge would just drop out of the oven when the door was lowered ; and that it could be cooled off in very few minutes. The carriage was to be moved to a discharger, a short distance off, where two hydraulic rams were to force up the bottoms on which the charges had been carried down into the boxes and in this way push out the cooled material on to a travel- ling band. Everything was to go as greased lightning. It was all perfect on paper - but as often before, beautiful theory was killed by ugly fact. W7hen the ram was run up until it was under the door closing the bottom of the oven and the catches were released, the door came away as the ram was lowered - but this bottom rarely carried the charge. During coking, the coal had expanded but had not</page><page sequence="13">May О, 1921. JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS¿ 397 afterwards contracted sufficiently to be free at the sides ; pressure from above seldom sufficed to move it and it was necessary to hack the burning mass out from below. The difficulty was never overcome and the discharging machine was soon put aside and the charge brought down on to a jury platform, where it was cooled off by squirting water on the glowing mass - a senseless proceeding, which ruined it as a fuel. Coalite must not be touched by water. On the few occasions when the charge came down into the cooling box, this proved to be entirely ineffective. I believe the cause to have been failure to close the openings properly at the bottom and top of the box, so that the charge burnt merrily inside, through in draught of air, counteract- ing the vain attempt to cool it from outside. A third serious fault was at the oven bot- tom. This was a long, narrow, cast iron box filled in with firebrick, in which a shallow channel was cut. A short curtain of thin iron plate was fixed to the oven bottom and when the door was brought into position, the curtain fitted into this channel ; water being run into the channel, a water seal was provided. The door carried the charge of coal to be carbonised - naturally, as car- bonisation went on, it became hot and the water boiled away. The water seal was altogether insufficient and at first provision was not even made to keep it filled. The leakage of air into the oven was therefore considerable, the charge was "overburnt, very little tar was produced and the gas was beneath contempt in quality. A better bottom was provided, after a time, with a deep water seal ; but then the jointing between the retort and the iron curtain proved defective. The experience was just that nearly all of us have had who have engaged in ex- perimental inquiry : a first experiment rarely does succeed in the expected manner and more often than not more is learnt from an unsuccessful than from a successful first trial : the difficulties and weak spots are made apparent. So it was at Barnsley. The great mistake made there - and it is the mistake the engineer is prone to make - was to erect complete works before the efficiency of the primary unit had been •established, even before the conditions of the problem, the requirements to be met, were fully understood : what is worse, without submi tting the scheme to competent criticism of its details. The first set of 9 ovens was soon rendered useless. Meanwhile a second similar set had been more carefully built : although this had the same faults as the first, now and then it was operated with some degree of success. Much more might have been learnt from it had the works managers been willing to listen to advice : as it was, the trials were unsystematic and unscientific and opportunities were wasted. I have never before had such an object lessson : never before have I felt so sure that we must modify our methods if we are to succeed in the future. To state my meaning in the one word in the English language which sums up the situation : if we are to solve problems of any importance, we must put them into the hands of gentlemen ; of men who will recognise that even the youngest among us is fallible ; who will subordinate the natural human tendency to be jealous of any and all "interference" in the interests of the cause to which they are committed : in short, who will realise the value of Rela- tivity and seek to work in harmonious co-operation with others. At the beginning of January, 1919, I wrote out a statement of the impressions I had formed, during 1917 and '18, from which I copy the following paragraphs. "Judging from its appearance, the Coalite produced has been over-carbonised on the average ; and the proportion of volatile matter has been unduly low. But these faults may be in part accounted for by the leakage of air into the ovens and especially the unsatisfactory method of discharging adopted, which has in- volved the exposure of the hot coalite to air and subsequent cooling by water. "Although the amount of tar produced, in the later trials, has varied considèrably, the average is not unsatisfactory, con- sidering the difficulties encountered. The maximum produced on some occasions has been not far short of that expected. The most satisfactory point established, however, is the fact that the tar as a whole (less a small proportion of the most volatile part) has passed muster as an Admiralty fuel. "It may therefore, be claimed that it is established that both a satisfactory solid fuel and a satisfactory oil fuel have been produced. Every improvement (especially the abolition of all air leakage) will undoubtedly be followed by an im- provement in these two fuels ; the rest</page><page sequence="14">398 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. May 6, 1921. will follow when these are satisfactory. "All that remains to be done is to construct an oven which can be operated satisfactorily and economically over a considerable period. Considerable difficulty may yet be experienced in effecting this object but it can only be a question of perseverance. The stake to be played for is one of such extreme public importance that any expenditure within reason will be justified and is called for. 4 'The results obtained with the second set of nine ovens are generally of s.o encouraging a character, that it appears to be desirable forthwith to construct a similar set, introducing the improve- ments in construction of the brick- work which experience shows to be necessary and making every effort to avoid leakage of air into the ovens during the carbonising operation. Modifications should be made both in the cover plates and in the oven bottoms to prevent such an air leakage. The attempt should be made to design a different form of oven bottom ; one in which the charge is held up by a plate hinged to the bottom of . the oven whilst the seal is effected by means of a separate light tray seems possible. The hinged plate might serve, when let down, to direct the charge into the cooling box ; the curtain might be fixed at some distance away from this plate, on either side, so that it would not be disturbed during the discharging operation. 4 4 The introduction of a simpler, better mode of discharge is imperative. Prob- ably the Coalite could be delivered directly into boxes each holding the charge from one or two ovens at most, which could be covered up with tightly fitting lids and cooled off in water. Another possible method would be to provide a travelling stage under the ovens on to which the charges could be let down and then conveyed awáy rapidly into a . cooling chamber ; this should be closed in, as far as possible, so as to prevent the access of air to the heated Coalite. ''New simpler forms of oven should be designed and put into operation without delay. A far simpler heating arrangement than that now in use is indicated as desirable. Instead of a farge number of burners requiring separate supply and regulation, gas might be introduced together with heated air from as few vents as possible into a mixing chamber, from which the burning gas might pass up vertical flues on the oven sides and down a central flue to the recuperator. Trials should also be made with lesser thicknesses of coal to ascertain if these could be carbonised so much more rapidly as to compensate for the lessened amount dealt with in each operation. "As it is probable that the amount of smokeless fuel required in future will be relatively small, it will be possible to use selected coals for its production. The coal used in the later trials has been of one kind and apparently one that is not specially suitable - at least it has not been found that it contracts regularly to such an extent as to leave the charge free at the end of the carbonising period. It will be necessary to try a variety of coals, so as to discover the kind which will contract to the right extent to give free delivery on discharge. "In addition to experiments bearing on the production of Coalite, however, the attempt should be made, without delay, to devise plant for the continuous carbonisation of coals which could not well be converted into Coalite, so as to separate their volatile constituents (gas, ammonia and oils) as completely as possible ; the residue should be charged immediately into producers and gasified. "To carry out a programme such as indicated above will not be an easy matter : it will be a costly enterprise and will only be feasible and successful if a competent staff be secured and all concerned can agree to work harmoniously together and to co-operate at every stage of the operation. The old English system in which each foreman or director keeps everything to himself, in which no effective co-operation of different interests is secured, must not be allowed to prevail. ' ' In May, 1919, the process came under a new management and the Company was fortunate in securing the services of Mr. T. M. Davidson, an engineer of original mind with a wide general experience. Three more ovens were built on the lines I have described. Studying these and dealing with the information that was available from the ID 17- 18 trials and the suggestions that had been made, Mr. Davidson soon grasped the essential features-</page><page sequence="15">'Mag 6, 1921. JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. 3Ó9 of the problem and has met the difficulties in a peculiarly happy way. The plant built to his designs has been in operation «ince November, 1920, and is undoubtedly a practical success. He has surmounted the expansion trouble in a strikingly simple and original manner, by building the oven, which is 1 1 inches wide, with upright walls and hanging in it two cast-iron plates in which numerous holes are drilled ; these plates can be moved in a vertical plane over a certain narrow range. Coal is filled into the space between the side of the oven and the opposed face of each plate, so that the width of the charge can be varied ; a space is left between the two plates. During carbonisation, the plates exercise the necessary pressure upon the coal ; at the same time, the volatile matters can escape at numerous points into the central space between them, thus avoiding undue local pressure on the walls of the oven. When carbonisation is at an end, the charge can be released by moving the plates away from the coked masses. During carbonisation, the charge is held up by an iron plate closing the bottom of the oven ; the plate is pivoted on a bar extending across the oven-bottom, so that it can be drawn aside by a lever at the oven-end. The oven is built immediately over and in direct connection with an airtight chamber cooled by water on either side. A door at the front of this chamber can be opened, so as to allow of the discharge of the cooled Coalite. In practice, the cooling chamber is first opened and the charge let down from a previous operation is raked out ; the Coalite is so cool that it can be handled. The door is then closed and screwed up tightly. Next, the oven top having been moved away, the bottom plate holding up the charge is drawn aside and the two vertical plates are then approximated and moved away from the two slabs of Coalite, which are then brought down into the cooling chamber below. The difficulties attending this operation are all but overcome : such as they are, they are obvious and will be met by slight adjustments. Of course, improve- ments are bound to come with use. The bottom plate having been brought into position, the vertical plates are adjusted, a charge is filled in and the top replaced. Carbonisation takes place in 5 to 8 hours, according to the thickness of the slab of Coalite produced. I show specimens of the Coalite which is now being made, such as I have seen discharged on several recent occasions and have even picked up with my own naked hands as it came out. It is a perfect product, equal I am told to the best produced by Mr. Parker. I think, in recognition of the great service which he rendered, some day soon, as large a slab as possible, enclosed in a museum case, should be placed in some prominent position, as the most appropriate tribute that can be paid to his memory : perhaps under it will be placed an apology signed by gas -engineers throughout the country ; being of a forgiving nature, recognising that we are all at some time miserable sinners, I will not advocate that Disraeli's suggestion be acted upon. If the completion of the invention and the development of the industry which cannot but arise be not now supported by all concerned, if the use of smokeless, solid, fuel - now that it is possible to produce a suitable on&amp; - be not soon made general : then indeed we shall all deserve to be hanged. Coal -Oil as Fuel. Let me now refer to the liquid oily product obtained on carbonising coal at low tem- peratures. It is too soon to speak of its uses in definite terms - we have everything to learn concerning its properties. It is so different from Gas Works Tar and the Tars produced in making metallurgical coke that, in my opinion, it should not even be spoken of as Tar : then no confusion will arise ; we shall do well to prevent confusion from the beginning. It will not be easy to find a name that will appeal. Coal -Oil as opposed to Coal-Tar may suffice for the present. It is safe, in the first instance, to value Coal -Oil simply as liquid fuel ; apart from cresol (cresylic acid), which is easily extracted from the oil by alkali, it contains none of the constituents of Coal Tar which gives this its special value. A certain amount of motor spirit may be separated from the oil and more of this can be scrubbed from the gas given off during carbonisation. In a practical test made by the Admiralty in 1918, the oil was found to be well within the specification in use for oil fuels. Already in the fourth article in The Times, on Coalite, in 1908, the special value of a supply of oil from Coal to the Navy was not overlooked.</page><page sequence="16">400 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. May 6, ieM. * 4 Should it ever come to pass that oil becomes the staple fuel of the Navy - and already most of the torpedo boats and destroyers are fitted for the combus- tion of liquid fuel - an abundant native supply of such an oil would become of paramount importance. It is an intoler- able position and one which offends the national sense of propriety, that this country should be dependent upon the foreigner for any part of the 'sinews of war. ' The use of oil fuel has passed the stage of experiment. It is now among the accepted order of things. It is therefore of the greatest importance that a never failing supply of burning oils should be produced within these Islands." Nov. 12th , 1908. %Much has been said during and since the War of the value of what are now called Key Industries. In the event of another war, oil will infallibly be our key of keys. The geological probability that we should find oil, in this country, was never great and after the trials that have been made, little hope is left to us. Bearing this in mind, it is imperative that we protect the coming industry against any interference from the oil interests : they must not be allowed to follow the dog-in-the-manger policy dis- played a few years ago by the gas interests. Probably, in the not distant future, a considerable saving of oil fuel will be effected by the use of specially prepared solid fuels in their place. By selecting coals and by carbonising under these or those conditions, it is possible to produce a series of fuels varying greatly in the readiness with which they burn. The coming shortness of oil fuel will often be met in this way, I believe. Already favourable results have been obtained with Coalite in this direction, using it for the purposes of road traction. In this account I have dealt advisedly with only one process, because I have had in view the immediate need which faces us of abolishing the smoke nuisance, whilst conserving the volatile matters in coal ; also because the process is one with which I am acquainted. To-day there are many active workers in the field and it is to be supposed that, ere long, we shall be in possession of a number of processes each applicable to some special purpose and conditions. Our Fuel Policy. Our immediate concern must now be to frame a comprehensive doctrine of Relativity to govern our use of fuel - of the energy at our disposal in coal. Interests must be consolidated, if we are in any way to secure both economy and efficiency. Hitherto, the coal interests have held aloof from every other but have battened upon all. The gas interests have been hopelessly narrow In their outlook. The electrical interests have perforce been developed apart from all others, because no one was wise enough in the beginning to foresee their importance. The Gas Industry made an irremediable mistake when it failed to adopt the infant Electricity at its birth ; its second great mistake was made in despising the movement for the production of a smokeless fuel. The manufacture of gas by methods in any way like those in use at present cannot be much longer an economic proposition : investors will decline to support so isolated an industry. We have to make up our minds as to how we shall be fed with energy in' future ; I believe we need it in all the four forms of Electricity, Gas, Liquid Fuel and Solid Smokeless Fuel. Co-operative organisations must be de- veloped for the supply of all these four forms. The -Germans have long since recognised that the by-products of one branch of manufacture must be made the raw material of another - that nothing may be wasted and that materials should he used in a progressive economic order. Our primary unit being coal, we must first take from it the volatile constituents - gas and oil ; then use the residue either as solid fuel or after complete gasification. As an illuminant for domestic use, elec- tricity stands unrivalled and its use should be universal. As time goes on we shall also use it more and more to assist us in our household work. It is also a superlative means of transmitting power on a large scale. Glowing coal has a beauty and charm of surface which no clay -begotten gas fire can ever exhibit - and it creates an atmos- phere of health such as gas and central heating cannot give. I feel sure that Ruskin would never have brooked the presence of a gas stove - he would have put his foot through it. I believe that all who can will continue to worship the Sun by the sacrifice of suitably carbonised coal on the domestic hearth.

JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. 401 The convenience of gas is so great -that many, sacrificing their aesthetic feelings, if they have any, will prefer to use it alone - provided the cost be not prohibitive. Gas, however, is fast reaching a price which must be prohibitive, especially when the cost of maintaining fittings in repair is taken into account : the mantles and burners of to-day are constantly breaking down ; honesty is* gone out of their manu- facture. The relative cost of gas and solid fuel should also be considered. A ton of good domestic coal, costing say £3 per ton, should afford 30 million British Thermal Heat Units : so that the Coal Therm (100,000 units) would cost about 2Jd. The South Metropolitan Gas Co. charges me 10.] d. per therm for its gas - probably the best in the country. Perhaps it is worth while to use gas at a cost up to three times the value of the coal therm- so I pay Ц times, at least, as much for my gas as it is worth. The sulphur impurity gas carries is most detrimental to plants and to household fittings. Being so much a Radical and also a Chemist, I have to be conservative in some things and so hitherto have had only gas in my house : 1 have now lost patience with it, however, and would get rid of it at once were it not that electric fittings are so costly. I think not a few of us will be forced back to oil lamps. The same dis- ability affects the gas stove, though perhaps not to the same extent : it is fragile and its efficiency falls off with use to a disturbing extent. Gas too is very easily wasted. Oil we must have for use in the internal combustion engine. Shortly the Americans will have none to spare and who knows what will be the fate of other sources of aupply ? We can only get it in quantity from our coal and from oil shales. If, however, we are to use gaseous fuel on any extended scale in the future, users must be trained not to waste it. Nothing is easier than to have the tap full on ; nothing more difficult than to persuade the average person so to adjust the supply that the punishment may fit the crime. Go into any chemical laboratory and notice the Bunsen burners - as a rule, the flames of those not in use will be turned full on and whether full on or not the air supply will rarely be properly adjusted. Probably a third to a half of the gas used in our laboratories is wasted As a teacher, I often sought to make students appreciate this point but rarely with success ; and I could never get my staff to see that flames were kept low or turned out when not required. There should be a flash-flame to every burner. Another of my fads was to protest against the waste of water. Notice anyone washing up - the tap is usually left running, not turned off, as it should be, directly the required modicum of water has been delivered. Notice also that in cleans- ing a vessel, most people fill it with water, then pour out the water and proceed to fill the vessel once more and so on ; the washing out is equally well done if only a small quantity of water be used each time. My desire was, however, not merely to teach students to economise gas and water but especially to lead them to do things in a thoughtful manner- deliberately and with intent. No such training is ever given in the schools and the average student is past thinking when he comes to College. In this as in most other respects, there is no prin- ciple of Relativity in our school system ; it. has nothing to do with practical require- ments ; but the Scribes will have it. so and the public makes no attempt to exercise control. A Ve get what we deserve. In using coal, excepting perhaps steam pressure at the boiler, practically nothing is measured ; in the electrical industry, every- thing is measured and indicated. The moral plane on which the coal user stands is, therefore, in no way comparable with that of the electrician. The waste of coal in our households is enormous : the kitchener makes economy impossible and no cook has the vestige of a coal conscience. In works there is the same careless disregard. Messrs. Crosfield and Sons have long had on their staff a fuel manager, who has been of the greatest service in securing not only economy but efficiency. I do not know that any firm has followed their example. Only this last week, however, I have learnt on authority that in a large manufacturing works in which the consumption of coal was under 4,000 tons per week, it has been found possible to save about 1,000 tons per week, merely by turning down taps, as it were. Coal is our only national asset : if we do not use it wisely, without fail we shall lose our place in the wTorld. It therefore behoves us to make it an object of adoration and care, not as it is at the moment the cause of an entirely inexcusable and wicked strife.</page><page sequence="18">1402 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. May 6, 1921. Whatever the rights of the present dispute, we cannot but admit that the miners have seen what must be the ultimate solution of the problem. All such elements of intelligence as we have should be brought together without delay, in considered con- . ference, to devise a rational scheme for its future working and use. DISCUSSION. The Chairman (Sir Arthur Duckham, K.C.B., M.Inst.C.E.), in opening the discussion, said he was sure all those present had very much appreciated the author's most interesting description of the low temperature carbonisation plant and its products. He thought they would also like to express their appreciation of the splendid work done by Mr. Salisbury Jones and Mr. Parker, whom the author mentioned. Personalty he had followed that work very closely and had been much impressed by it ; he had visited Barnsley and seen the plant there, and it had been explained to him in great detail. Speaking as an outside engineer, he thought the plant at Barnsley was quite near enough to a commercial, satisfactorily working plant. As the author had said, there were one or two small items in the plant that required improving, but the firm appreciated its defects and he was quite certain the very competent engineer, Mr. Davidson, who was now in charge of the plant, would succeed in remedying them. The great drawback, to his mind, of low tem- perature carbonisation was that he had never seen - or been convinced that there could be - an absolutely satisfactory balance sheet in connection with that process, and he thought that was the reason why it had not been taken up, and was not being taken up to-day, by the gas industry. The two items to be taken into consideration in connection with the balance sheet in low temperature carbonisation were the value of the semi-coke or coalite and the value of the oils. He had been speaking in that room recently for another Society on the subject of coal as a source of oil supply and he had tried to find a value for low temperature coal oils, as the author called them, but he could riot get any really sound value. He had spoken to those connected with low temperature carbonisation plant and had been told that high prices could be obtained for the fuel produced, prices which put the financial balance sheet on a proper footing. He told Mr. Salisbury Jones that if the firm could obtain a good price for the oil and a contract for a long period, and if the public took up the use of the fuel, the firm had a very prosperous future before it. He thought it would be agreed that the oil from a low temperature carbonisation plant should be of good value, and he had great hopes that further development work on that oil would prove it was of the highest value ; and he agreed with the author that all coal should be treated before use and the hydrocarbons in the form of oil removed. The fuel produced by low temperature carbonisation was the crux of the whole question to his mind. He had tried it and examined it and compared it with other fuels. On one occasion he imported a ton of it into his own house, together with a ton of another fuel, coke made in a continuously working vertical retort, and about a fortnight afterwards his cook said that if he bought any more of "that black murk" she would leave the house. Therefore he might be prejudiced about it ! He thought the question of the fuel was one that required further discussion. The other point on which he was not at one with the author was that he had no great liking for solid fuel but thought the future of this country was with heat units distributed as gas or oil, and light and power units distributed as electricity. He had recently been talking in Sheffield to a very important mining engineer there, who said he was not going to open up his colliery until he could build a colliery with only one railway siding and that only with an inward traffic of pit props ; he would have two pipelines out, one for oil and one for gas. That gentleman had the audacity to suggest that he should arrange it for him, but he replied that he would like a little more time to think about it ! In conclusion, he wished to emphasise the fact that the balance 3heet was the point that required discussion. Every one appreciated the advantages of smokeless fuel and of taking oil out of the coal, and the work that had been done in that direction, and he thought that, as far as their plant was concerned, the Company that had been responsible for that work had reached a practical success, and much praise was due to them. Dr. J. A. Harker, F.R.S., said that, while he greatly appreciated the extremely interesting account the author had given, particularly of the recent experiments at Barnsley, and the evolution of the process, he thought it was a little unfortunate that the author had not given a more definite answer to that aspect of the question which the Chairman had mentioned, г.е., the balance sheet. Some years ago the Ministry of Munitions were considering, owing to the threats of the submarines, what steps should be taken if this country was obliged to find a substitute for the nitrate of soda imported from Chile, and the problem of the fixation of nitrogen was very prominently before the Ministry at that time. In connection with that it appeared possible that this country might be driven to use a process for fixing nitrogen which would require very large quantities of electric power. In a country where, certainly under war conditions, it was quite impossible to provide that electric power from a large station driven by water, it seemed illogical to</page><page sequence="19">May 6,1921. JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. 403 burn coal and destroy, by burning the coal raw in a furnace, that amount of fixed nitrogen which was in the coal and which ought to be recovered. In a station to generate 100,000 k.w. the annual loss of nitrogen would amount to about 25,000 tons of ammonium sulphate. In connection with the possibility of establishing a large power station such as he had mentioned, it was necessary to examine whether, as part of the scheme for that station, carbonisation of the fuel by any of the known processes should be /attempted. At that time the question of low temperature carbonisation was very prominently before the public, and the Ministry felt it was a subject which should certainly not be ignored. A Sub-Committee, including Mr. W. R. Cooper, chairman, Sir John Snell, and Mr. Albright - Sir Arthur Duckham was also associated with it - visited Barnsley twice and were given the fullest facilities to see the work that was being carried on there. It was only a large scale experiment at that date, and perhaps the author would agree that it was still only an experiment, whose value was not yet proved. That experiment, however, was of such an important character that it was necessary for the results attained to be understood, and in the course of the Committee's investigations the following facts were ascertained. On a pre- war basis, the claim of the Coalite Company was to take a ton of coal costing about £1 and make about 14 cwt. of coalite from it, of which 12 to 13 cwt. was saleable as lump coalite, the remainder being breeze,- which was utilized in the process. The production of a satisfactory balance sheet depended on the 13 cwt. of coalite being sold for the same price as that given for the ton of coal, the by-products obtainable paying for the running of the process and providing the profits. The whole economics of the process would be upset if, as had been pointed out, the price obtained for the by- products was not sufficient for that purpose. On the claims of the Company on a pre-war basis it seemed to him that the point as to whether the balance sheet was satisfactory or not rested on quite a narrow margin of something like 6d. or Is. a ton. Now that coal to put into the retort was going to cost up to £3 a ton - it might not be quite as much as that on a large scale - did the author expect that the Company would be able to sell the resulting coalite for roughly £4 10s., and to run the process simply on the pre-war lines multiplied by a factor representing the increased price of coal V If that was so, coalite might serve as a low tem- perature fuel for domestic use, but he could not see that it could have the slightest application to large scale power production. He had hoped that the plant and experience of the Coalite Company would have made it possible to substitute for the fuel costing £1 a ton on a pre-war basis coal costing about 8s. or 9s., and to have an extremely valuable intermediate step, i.e., instead of burning raw coal in a big power station, either to use in the boilers the coalite and the power gas obtained in the process, or to gasify the coalite afterwards and use the whole of the thermal units as gaseous fuel. On the pre-war basis, if it had been possible so to modify the plant, which was then designed solely for making smokeless fuel from a good coal, it might have been possible - with some accompanying disadvantages perhaps - to substitute a more or less low grade coal, such as would be used in a large power station, and- do something equally good from the point of view of national economy. The possibility of doing that seemed much more remote with coal- ' at its present price. There was no doubt, however, from the evidence collected by the Nitrogen Products Committee, some of which was published in their Report, that the Barnsley experiment was far and away th&amp; most serious low temperature carbonisation1 experiment that had yet been made. When he was at the Bureau of Mines in America he was asked to deal in a lecture to the staff of the Bureau, with the question of the carbonisation of coal as treated in the Report. Some of the experts there were extremely interested in the presentation of the facts as given in that report, and in some additional data he was able to furnish as to the Barnsley scheme. The author's description of the way in which the Barnsley Company had succeeded in overcoming the difficulties outlined was of considerable interest. He wished to congratulate the Company on the- progress it had made, but he felt inclined to agree with the Chairman that from many points of view the economics of the scheme were not vet proved. Mr. J. F. Ward said Mr. Marshall wished to « point out that no reference had been made to. internally heated coal, in which Mr. Marshall- had taken a great interest and in connection; with which some experiments had already been carried out. It had not been fully proved that the volatile matter could be condensed from the large amount of producer gas which was: necessary to carbonise the coďl, but quite/ sufficient evidence had been forthcoming to show that when suitable condensing arrangements had been made, practically the whole of the eon- • densable hydrocarbon could be obtained. The; principal point was that the gas evolved from the producer was not entirely lost but could be ¡ used for power purposes, and, if necessary» •• could be introduced into the retort. Economy^! of fuel must be considerable in producing the' : amount of fuel necessary to complete catfbori+b isation and none of the gas used in carbomfeiiig ¡ was lost if the retort was erected near a potoer- using works. He thought the method that should - be adopted was that which! used internally:, heated rather then externally heü ted retorts^*, and in that Mr. Marshall agreed.</page><page sequence="20">404 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. May 6, 1921. Mr. A. H. Seabrook said it was in connection with electric supply that he first began to look into the possibilities of extracting something out of the coal before it was burned under the boilers. He spent a great deal of time on the matter, but he found that on the whole the capital cost and the increased cost of the labour required to run the plant really equalled the value of the products obtained. The par- ticular form of the process in which he had been interested was the Tozer process. A plant to work that process was now being constructed in South Africa and would be finished by about the end of the year, and it would be very inter- esting to see what results were obtained. The procese consisted roughly of the low temperature carbonisation of the fuel first of all and the gasification of the resulting semi-coke, and the firing of boilers with the gas, about 140 or 150 B.T. [I. per foot, and the production of calcium carbide. His own experience with fuel car- bonised at low temperature was that it was excellent as far as its smokeless qualities were concerned but that it burned very rapidly compared with ordinary coke. He could not see that the producers of the semi-coke were going to get a large price per ton for it, and, as Dr. Barker pointed out, the value of that product was the crux of the whole question. It was no good going to a huge capital ex- penditure and a huge labour cost, in order to get something out of coal that ought to be got from it, if it could not be done on a satisfactory financial basis. Mr. W. H. Patchell said he had spent a good deal of money on low temperature carbon- isation and after thoroughly going into the .subject he felt obliged to advise those interested in it to drop it and go in for complete gasi- fication. He was very much struck by the sample of coalite shown by the author. When he saw that sample, after looking at the photographs shown on the screen, he wondered where it «ame from and what special system of selection the author used to pick such a large piece up, because the photographs showed that the coalite was practically all breeze. Some people started to sell low temperature coke and then went on tò say that everything must be coked, but everything would not coke. Only a relatively small proportion of coal in this country would coke. A good deal of money had been spent on plant to burn low grade coal for the sake of obtaining the by-products from it, but it would be found that in every case the use of that kind of coal had been abandoned and the best coal obtainable was employed instead. Thai showed that the difficulty of handling was the crux of the whole question. Now that people could not always get coal and had to burn coke, they appreciated what the people who had tried to burn low grade coal were up against. Further, he did not know whether the "black muck" to which the Chairman had referred was the coalite or the vertical retort coke ! In the previous autumn he had tried to get through to see the Smith process used in the States, as that seemed to him one of the most promising systems that had yet been invented. It was a two-stage process. The first stage was to make the coke and the second stage to briquette it. He thought the Company at Barnsley would have to pay serious attention to that process and that they would have to have some kind of briquetting, because low temperature fuels were very friable. Another promising, process was the Neilson process, in which the coke was made to stick together while it was in a plastic state instead of being briquetted. There was also another process in the States, which had a kind of movable grate, not de- pending on gravity, to get the coke out. Some of those processes were exceedingly interesting. He thought some method of making low tem- perature coke more coherent and easier to transport would have to be adopted in this country. Mr. G. M. Gill, speaking as a gas engineer, said that when the coalite process was first introduced he studied it and thought it was fundamentally wrong as a carbonising process. Very great claims were made on behalf of it at that time and a great deal of money was put into it by the public, much of which was lost. It seemed to him that the great problem in low temperature carbonising was to make a coke which would stand handling, and he did not think there was any process by which it was possible for that to be done, while leaving a considerable proportion of volatile matter still in the coke and only heating it to a compara- tively low temperature. In a gasworks the coal was heated to a high temperature, the volatile matter being driven right off, and in the process the coke became harder each extra minute it was carbonised, and in that way it was made strong enough to stand the rough treatment that it received in the ordinai y course of handling. Even in that process, with the coke made so hard, something like 10 per cent, of coke dust was obtained. Gas engineers did not agree with the author that their procoss was inefficient. Out of a ton of coal they obtained about 16 to 17 cwt. of useful products for disposal, of which 4 to 5 cwt. consisted of gas, tar and ammonia products, and 12 to 13 cwt. of coke and coke breeze, the balance of 3 or 4 cwt. as coke, being used for carbonising the coal. It would be seen, therefore, that coke formed the larger portion of the products, and he did not think gas coke ought to be despised at all. It was a fuel that contained a little moisture, ash, and volatile matter, but the vast bulk of it was carbon. It was most suitable for burning in hand-fired boilers, of which there were many thousands in this country. As coke consisted almost entirely of carbon, it was unnecessary to regulate the air when burning</page><page sequence="21">May e, 1921. JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. 40Ô it, after having once fixed the correct quantity, whereas with coal the air ought to be varied from minute to minute, which was of course impracticable. Gas engineers were not at all dissatisfied with their process, but they were quite willing to admit the advantages of low temperature carbonisation when they saw a satisfactory balance sheet obtained from the process. That had not been seen yet, but it might be produced in the future and would be welcomed by gas engineers. Mr. D. M. Henshaw said he thought the subject of low temperature carbonistaion should be carefully investigated by those who were interested in the matter of coal conservation. He would like to ask the author what amount of ash was contained in the sample of coalite ex- hibited. The ash content of the coal had a good deal to do with the question whether it could be successfully coked and the coke kept in a condi- tion suitable for transport and then burned, for example, in the domestic fire grate. If the coal had a high ash content, then, no matter what amount of volatile matter was left in the coke, it still had certain disabilities which were inherent in coke of any description, in that it made a dusty fire. Dust was perhaps almost as much a drawback to solid fuel as smoke was. Looked, at from the standpoint of the producer of fuel oil, he supposed the matter had to be considered from the point of view of the value of that oil полу and in the future. If the balance sheet was such that the fuel oil was going to be the product of pre-eminent value, certain coals which were not strictly coking coals might be treated by the low temperature carbonisation process for the production of fuel oil. With regard to the Neilson retort which had been mentioned, that was now in an advanced experimental stage and was distinct from the other processes that had been tried out in this country in that it had the peculiar feature of being heated internally by the sensible heat of producer gas. The producer was linked up in direct connection with the retort, which was an inclined cylinder very similar to a rotary cement kiln, and the coal was allowed to travel slowly down the cylinder by reason of the angle of inclination and the slow rotation of the cylinder. A certain proportion of the semi- coke produced was used in the producer for the production of the producer gas, the gas being led directly from the producer, which was worked at a relatively high temperature, and the coking process was carried out by means of the sensible heat of the producer gas. The gases evolved from the coal were mixed with the producer gas and removed to the upper end of the cylinder. As Dr. Ward had mentioned, the question had yet to be fully established as to what the prospects were of recovering the volatile products from the combined gases and as to what the value of those products would be when recovered in that way. He thought the salient feature of the process was that one did not require a superheated surface, such as was used in the retort which was externally heated, in order to carry out the process of carbonisation. In all forms of externally heated retorts the wall of the retort was naturally of a higher tem- perature than the material being treated, and he 4 thought experts who had investigated the matter had established the fact that a great deal of the condensable gases which were evolved came directly into contact, when released from the coal, with the superheated surfaces and were cracked or split up, and a great deal of the condensable contents was thus lost. Conse- quently one might assume that a great pro- portion of what would be valuable fuel oil or other forms of liquid products was lost in the cracking up stage which thus took place. In conclusion, he wished to say that the paper had been an extremely enjoyable one, and he was sure everyone present was very much indebted to the author for it, particularly for the detailed description given of the process established at Barnsley. Dr. F. Mollwo Perkin said the paper was a very interesting one, but he was rather sorry the author had confined himself entirely to the one process. As several speakers had mentioned, there were many other low temperature car- bonisation processes. There were the Tozer, the Yeadon Whittaker retorts, also the Smith process, which was a dual process, the coke being made first and then briquetted. He was not at all sure that that was not the best process to employ, because, as Mr. Gill had said, in the gas works 10 per cent, of the coke was obtained in the form of breeze, which could be briquetted. Furthermore, if the coke from the low temperature carbonisation process, which was much softer than that produced in a gas works, was briquetted, a very valuable domestic fuel was obtained. At the present moment the binder pitch used for the briquetting was very expensive, but pitch was obtained when either low temperature or high temperature products were being produced. It was rather difficult sometimes to make gas engineers understand that the products obtained by low temperature carbonisation were not the same as those obtained by high temperature carbonisation. It was said that benzol was obtained by low temperature carbonisation, just as it was at a gas works, but that was quite wrong. From the low temperature carbonisation process motor spirit, fuel oil and pitch were obtained, but different products were obtained in the gas works. The coke from the gas works was very much harder, generally speaking, than the coke from the low temperature process. He had recently examined some coke made from coal obtained from some of the Kent ^collieries, and which had been carbonised at 600° C., and the coke was just as hard as ordinary coke obtained from either horizontal or vertical</page><page sequence="22">406 JOURNAL Oí THE ROYAL SOCIETÝ OF ÁRŤS. May e, ioti. retorts. In order to increase the quantity of gas produced, gas works had recently been steaming their vertical retorts very heavily, and were thus burning a considerable quantity of their carbon, and as a consequence they obtained a coke which was pretty high in ash, because, owing to the carbon being burned off, naturally the ash content increased. The ash content in any coke depended entirely upon the ash which was in the coal before it was carbonised, whether it was carbonised at high or low tem- perature. It was an extraordinary thing, however, that verj' often coal which contained a considerable quantity of ash would, if car- bonised, yield 1агце quantities of oil and at the same time give a very useful briquette, which, although it might be ashy, would burn well. It was sometimes said that if the last 12 per cent, in the low temperature coke was distilled off a great deal more oil would be obtained, but that was not so. Gas was obtained and not oil. He had recently been carbonising some peat at a temperature of 500° 0., and he obtained 6,000 ft. of gas, which was what he expected to obtain, but 'yhen that same peat was carbonised at a temperature of 600° C. it gave between 10,000 and 11,000 cubic ft. of gas and also a larger yield of oil. In gas engineering there was a great deal yet to be learned on the subject of carbonisation: so far, however, this country had led the way in the matter. The Chairman (Sir Arthur Duckman, K.C.B., M.Inst.C.E.) said there were two points he wished to bring before the meeting One was the question of briquetting, which was one of the most important, that had to be considered in connection with the handling of fuel. The briquetting of some fuels, such as peat and lignite, was easy, but the briquetting of coal was not so satisfactory, and he had never yet seen a successful method of briquetting coke. He understood, however, that work was being carried out on that subject. The briqtietting of any sort of fuel was a very important matter and one that ought to receive careful considera- tion. He thought those who were concerned with low temperature carbonisation would welcome some method of briquetting the dust that remained behind. The other point he wished to mention was with regard to the work being done at the present time in the removal of ash from coal. If one imagined a low tem- perature plant working with a more or less ash-free coal one would realise at once the improvement that would be brought about, because it was quite certain that a material like coalite made an ash which was not pleasant to have in a fire grate or wherever it was burned. If those two points were taken into considera- tion he thought it would be of very great assist- ance to the development of low temperature fuel and fuel from gas works. The possibilities of a coke which produced practically no ash were to his mind wonderful. Most of those present had heard of the Trent process, the Elmore process and others in that connection, but he did not think success had been achieved by any of those processes, although they pro- vided good groundwork for further development. Prof. H. E. Armstrong, in replying to the discussion, called attention to a bottle of coal oil he had brought to the meeting, to show how - absolutely different it was from coal tar. The oil could be poured easily, almost like water. With regard to the demands that had been made for the balance sheet of the process, it was not for a professor to deal with questions of cost. He had said that the process dated back to the year 1905 but practically it only dated back to a year ago, when plant was set going which produced the magnificent product cf which he exhibited a specimen. Mr. Parker did a great work with Mr. Salisbury J ones in showing that low temperature carbonisation was practic- able ; but he never developed it satisfactorily and his knowledge was largely lost. The first Barnsley experiment was not a practical success; but on the second Barnsley experiment a most, remark- able process had been developed, and only minor adjustments were required to bring it to a point when it would be entirely practicable. He did not wish to undertake the discussion of toro many subjects at the. same time ; he had advisedly dealt with the subject from the point of view of the general public only and the use of -a material which would make life fairlv comfortable in a big city. With regard to the Chairman's statement that in the future gas only would be burned, there was an immense amount to be said for that ; but it must be realised that the fight was going to be between gas and coalite. Either gas together with coalite would be used or gas only. The cost of bringing gas into a big city and supplying everyone with it must be taken into considera- tion, as a very large capital would be required for the mains to give the necessary supply. Personally he did not believe that gas under- takings were going to develop on that scale for a long time to come. The Chairman said that he had tried coalite : if he tried it several years ago it could not have been the same thing as the coalite now produced. Coalite was never made at Barnsley prior to November, 1920. Something was sold before under that name but it all suffered from being over-burned through exposure to the air while it was cooling down. No proper cooling off ргосезз was then developed ; indeed the invention of that process was the great step forward that had now been taken. The factory at Barnsley was an absolutely smokeless one and afforded a great contrast to a high temperature metal- lurgical coke works a short distance off. The people of this country liad to make up their minds whether or not they were going to make their cities comfortable to live in, and that</page><page sequence="23">May с, 1921. JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS. 407 could only be done with the aid of smokeless fuel. The question whether they were going to use coalite with gas for cooking purposes or gas only was one that could only be decided in the future. Coalite was quite hard enough for ordinary purposes and it burned in the most perfect manner possible. People ought to be pre- pared to pay more for it than for coal ; it was a better fuel than coal because it did not burn away so rapidly and because it was smokeless. It could be said quite definitely that the minimum value of the oil obtained was that of any similar crude petroleum fuel oil. There was quite enough coal which could be converted into coalite to supply that material for a long time; and quite a large number of small coals, when properly washed, could be improved very much as fuel by conversion into coalite. The specimen he showed was made from a washed coal and prob- ably did not contain more than 5 or (5 per cent. Of ash. No coal ought to be used which had not been washed down to that point if a proper fuel were to be produced. It seemed to him that there was no difficulty in getting at the economics of the process : taking the two facts into account - that a superior kind of fuel was obtained and an oil which was certainly at least as valuable as any similar petroleum fuel oil - a fair idea could be obtained of the pros- pects. In addition, there was a certain amount of motor oil to be got and 5,000 ft. of gas per ton of coal. With reference to the Chairman's friend at Sheffield who proposed to send out his coal as gas, in the ease of a town like Sheffield, where gas was largely used, that was the only rational policy to pursue ; but London was in an entirely different position. London was further away from the coalfields, although not so far as it was thought to be a few years ago, before the Kent coal had been brought into use. As hckhad said at the conclusion of his paper, some intelligence must now be used in dealing with the question of the fuels to be employed ; people must set to work on the subject so that a proper proportionate system of treatment could be introduced. He thought the gas light companies were now for the third time in a critical position and that they had once more to make up their minds whether they would go into partnership with other interests or not. He did not believe for a moment that when people had once learned to appreciate coalite they would use ordinary coal for domestic purposes. He trusted one result of the present meeting would be that an effort would be made to treat the whole fuel problem in a scientific manner, so that all the various interests might in some way or other be united and dealt with comprehensively. On the motion of The Chairman, seconded by Mr. Patchell, a hearty vote of thanks was accorded to Prof. Armstrong for his interesting paper, and the meeting then terminated.</page></plain_text>
