<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY ANTHROPOMORPHIC MAT FROM NEW MEXICO Several Southwestern archaeologists who have seen the mat pictured in Figure 136 consider it unusual enough to merit description in print, despite a scarcity of information about its provenience and associations. The mat has catalog number 943/7 in the collections of the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum at Canyon, Texas. It was donated to the Museum by Henry Crain of Canyon in 1942. Mr. Crain informs me that he found the mat in a multiroomed cave about 1/2 mile above the mouth of Mule Creek, a tributary of the San Francisco River in the Mogollon Range of southwestern New Mexico, not far from Clifton, Arizona. He and several hunting companions removed the mat and other archaeological materials from the cave in 1899, when he was ranching in the Mogollon region. Other items included 2 small brown pottery bowls, 2 wooden bows 4 or 5 feet long, and a number of obsidian-tipped ar- rows. Smaller bows and poorly preserved arrows were left in the cave. Mr. Crain recalls that the cave was later investigated by someone from New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts at Las Cruces. The shape of the mat is shown in Figure 136. In its present headless condition the specimen is 17 inches long and 12 inches wide. According to Mr. Crain, the head was present when the mat was collected, and was a featureless rectangle somewhat wider than the neck, on which it was centered. Also missing are triangular areas at the outside of the left elbow, the outer corner of the right hand, and the bottom of the right foot. The mat is made of thin yucca strips from 2 to 4 mm. wide. The material is well preserved, retaining its color and flexibility. The mat is loosely twilled in a two-over, two-under technic, except in the lower body and right leg, where a three-over, three-under technic prevails. Strip ends on the back side are long and un- concealed. The mat retains no trace of painting or other decoration. JACK T. HUGHES Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum Canyon, Texas December, 1954 A FLUTED POINT SITE IN UTAH * The Statewide Archeological Survey of the Depart- ment of Anthropology at the University of Utah was recently informed of a site 12 miles east of Ferron, Utah, which has yielded at least one fluted point. Homer Behunin, the local collector who reported the site, found the point (Fig. 137 a) protruding from the wall of Silverhorn Wash about 15 feet below the surface. The Silverhorn Site (42EM8) proved, upon examina- tion, to be a shallow rock shelter in a protected bend of the wash. The shelter contains at least 12 occupation levels separated by sterile alluvial deposits. The upper- * The work herein reported was financed by the University of Utah Research Fund. most occupation level is covered by about 10 feet of hard, compact alluvium which reaches to within about a foot of the shelter roof. The occupation levels are easily detected through the presence of small pieces of charcoal which have been somewhat disturbed by the inundations which brought in the alluvial materials. In addition to charcoal, small burned areas or hearths, chips, bone fragments, and occasional artifacts are to be found. Limited testing by the author and a group of students failed to produce more fluted points but the bases of 2 blades (Fig. 137 b, c) were found. Silverhorn Wash is at the western edge of the San Raphael Swell. It is a short southern tributary of Ferron Creek which in turn is a southern tributary of the San Raphael River. A study of the wash made by Loren W. Slentz of the Department of Geology at the Uni- versity of Utah has brought out several significant facts. The canyon, at most 100 yards wide, and from 20 to 60 feet deep, was eroded into sandstone bedrock. The a ;55~ ~ ~ ?j!: C b FIG. 137. Silverhorn size.)
