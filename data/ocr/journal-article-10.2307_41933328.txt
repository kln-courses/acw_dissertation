<plain_text><page sequence="1">Puett, Michael J.: To Become a God : Cosmology, Sacrifice, and Self-Divinization in Early China , Harvard- Yenching Institute Monograph Series, 57. (Cambridge: Harvard University Asia Center, 2002), xvii + 358pp., $49.50. ISBN 0-674-00959-2. The author (History, Harvard) draws upon the most recently discovered texts as well as those traditionally studied to pursue the "debate" (p. 4) from Shang to Han between the view that human beings must propitiate the gods to divine their intent and perhaps influence their actions and the view that human beings may themselves acquire a spiritual character and its attendant power. He pilots a course among the chief scholars who have preceded him in interpreting the Chinese sources. Puett concludes at the end of Western Han when such thinkers as Kuang Heng turned back in time from the Qin-Han theomorphic view to the Shang and Western Zhou kings and the rituals which, following David Keightley, sought to influence lower ancestors who would appeal to those above them who would then seek to please the more powerful, non-ancestral spirits up to Di. He quotes Keightley, "The Shang con- ceived of the Nature and the Ancestral Powers as occupying a hierarchy of negotiabil- ity, with the close ancestors and ancestresses of the pantheon being most open to this kind of pledging, and the high Powers, both ancestral and natural, being less approach- able in this way." (p. 48.) Thus was formed a unity of ancestral ghosts and the spirits of nature. The old system was challenged by the fourth century with the appearance at court of individuals who claimed to be able to jump over the hierarchy of deceased an- cestors directly to establish communication with the overarching Great One. Of special interest is the text Taiyi sheng shui discovered in the Guodian tomb and "probably dating to the late fourth century BC... 'The Great One gives birth to Water. Water goes back and supplements [i.e., joins with] the Great One. They thereby com- plete Heaven. Heaven goes back and supplements the Great One. They thereby com- plete Earth. Heaven and Earth [return and supplement each other.]'" Here the Great One generates "on its own" water. Water and the Great One then "join to give birth to Heaven. Then Heaven and the Great One combine to make the Earth." (p. 160.) Puett examines the emergence during Warring States of attempts to substitute self- cultivation for practices such as divination and sacrifice, based on new understandings of the nature of spirits and their relation to humanity. Humans now sought to bridge the gap between themselves and the spirits. That is, rather than anthropomorphizing di- JAH 37/1 (2003)</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 1 1 1 vinities, they sought themselves to approach divinity. It is to this cluster of practices that the "self-divinization" of Puett's title refers. The contest between classical specialists in ritual and the champions of the Great One went on during the Qin and Han. Puett argues that the sacrificial system of the time was based not so much on a correlative system as on divinization through sacrifice as opposed to cosmology. He describes the consolidation of local cults and appeal to higher gods in aid of the divinization of the ruler himself, culminating in the Emperor Wu's sacrifices to the Great One. Puett describes the criticism of this theomorphism by both the Huainanzi , which argued for a cosmological divinization, and Dong Zhongshu who would substitute for divinization a system of correlative sacrifices. Chapter 7 ex- amines cosmologies from the Huainanzi based on ascension and self-divinization, theomorphic humans and anthropomorphic gods. As Puett notes, according to the views set out in Huainanzi, neither sagehood nor the state of being a True Man was the exclu- sive province of the ruler. "Anyone can achieve either state through self-cultivation." (p. 285.) The potential threat to ordered government is apparent. Meanwhile, Sima Qian saw the geographic expansion of the empire as a means of accruing increasing di- vine power to the emperor. And it was in part due to that very expansion, and its insta- bility, that rulers came to be returned to the status of human beings, operating in a realm quite separate from the divine. Chapter 8 examines the new sacrificial system of Wudi based on Taiyi "the Great One" and the critiques thereof and why in 31 B.C the system was rejected in favor of a new set of sacrifices to Heaven and Earth, these reputedly harking back to Western Zhou. This new system rejected claims to self-divinization or theomorphism on the part of humans. Heaven and humans are seen rather as correlated, each operating in its own sphere. Hereafter, "claims of ascension and self-divinization ceased to be favored at court. And, indirectly, these reforms may in part have been responsible for the later popularity of millenarian movements, many of which would, in their critiques of the Han state, embrace the very notions of divinization and ascension that the reforms of Kuang Heng and others had driven out of the central court."
