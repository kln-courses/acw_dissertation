He directs the Southern Hebrides Mesolithic Project, which is reconstructing early postglacial hunter-gatherer settlement patterns in western Scotland. His book The Prehistory of the Mind will be published by Thames and Hudson in 1996. Previous publications include Thoughtful Foragers: a Study of Prehistoric Decision-Making (CUP, 1990). Evolutionary psychology's model of the mind What is the mind? It is like a Swiss Army knife, pro- posed the evolutionary psychologist Leda Cosmides at a recent conference hosted jointly by the British Academy and Royal Society It is no more than a col- lection of specialized devices housed within a single case. The devices of the mind are cognitive processes each dedicated to a specific aspect of thought and beha- viour, such as those concerning language, social inter- action or manipulating physical objects. In the jargon of the evolutionary psychologists, the mind has a domain- specific architecture: a series of mental modules which are universal to all humans and which evolved to solve the adaptive problems faced by Pleistocene hunter-gatherers (Barkow et al 1992; Hirschfeld &amp; Gel- man 1994). The core of their argument is that the pressures of the Pleistocene hunter-gatherer lifestyle had the result that specific ways of thinking became 'hard wired' into the human mind: those ways of thinking which achieved reproductive success for our Palaeolithic ancestors. As such, the evolutionary psychologists argue, the mind is content rich at birth with intuitive knowledge about the structure of the world - or at least the world of the Pleistocene. The cultural context in which a young mind develops today is argued to play a minor con- tribution in comparison to this universal, genetically fixed cognitive endowment in determining how the ma- ture mind will think and the types of knowledge it will acquire. As a consequence, evolutionary psychology is claimed to be the path towards understanding both the human mind and human culture. Is this just sociobiology by the backdoor? Yet an- other attempt at academic hegemony over the social sciences by biologists? Some of the work by evolution- ary psychologists certainly seems to be little different from the sociobiological outpourings of the 1 970s. David Buss's (1994) recent book, for instance, which gives us the supposedly startling result that young women like to 'mate with' wealthy men, while men like to 'mate with' pretty young girls, seems to match some of the sociobiology with regard to the trivial na- ture of its questions and answers. But other proposals made by the evolutionary psychologists should be taken more seriously by social anthropologists as they find very wide support from experimental, developmental and comparative psychology. Leda Cosmides's (1989) own experimental studies using the Wason selection test have shown that people appear more adept at solving problems when these are framfd in social rather than non-social terms. This arises, she argues, from the manner in which the mind has been designed by natural selection. Studies of child development have also shown that young minds appear to contain knowledge about the world which could not have been acquired from experience since birth, such as about the structure of language (Pinker 1994), the beha- viour of physical objects (Spelke 1991) and the ways in which minds work (Whiten 1991). Young minds also appear to possess an intuitive understanding of basic bi- ology (Atran 1990). Studies of cognitive pathologies, such as autism, have shown that when some parts of the mind can break down other parts are left unaffected, supporting the idea of relatively independent mental modules (Leslie 1991; Donald 1991). There is indeed a substantial and rapidly growing body of theory and data to support the idea that the mind has a domain-specific architecture, involving mental modules which are con- tent rich and evolved to solve the problems faced by our hunter-gatherer ancestors. Yet common sense tells us otherwise. Now common sense is not always the best guide as to how the world works; common sense tells us that there should not be a senseless war in Bosnia, or that primary education should not be underfunded in Britain. We know that both of these are indeed the case. Yet when it comes to the mind, common sense provides a compelling argu- ment against the proposals of the evolutionary psycho- logists. If they are correct, how can people be so good at engaging in activities which have no possible selective benefit to Pleistocene hunter-gatherers, such as pure mathematics? Could no more than a hunter-gatherer mentality enable us to have developed cures for cancer, placed mhen on the moon and developed the internet? Could these, as an evolutionary psychologists might argue, be no more than the chance by-products of a hunter-gatherer mentality which had evolved for prob- lems concerned with making stone tools or acquiring sufficient food? I think not. Moreover, when we think about how our own minds work we have no inkling that we may be constantly switching from one sort of mental module to another. Our intuitive understanding of our own minds is that we use the same thought processes when we are inter- acting with people, ideas or physical objects. That is, we have a general purpose, non-specialized intelligence. If we possessed independent cognitive processes for thinking about different types of entities, how can we be so good at using analogy and metaphor? How can I tell my daughter that she is a flower, if one part of my mind knows about pretty flowers, and another about my pretty daughter? Indeed simply by being able to invoke the analogy that the mind is like a Swiss Army knife, Leda Cosmides appears to falsify the claim that is being made. Now it may be argued that there is no reason why we should have an understanding of our own mental archi- tecture and are consequently suffering from 'instinct blindness'. I find this difficult to accept: if a domain specific architecture has been gradually built by mil- lions of years of evolution why are we so blind to its existence? Why do we intuitively feel that our minds are quite the reverse, a general purpose learning mech- anism? A further reason for doubting that our minds have no more than a domain-specific, content rich architecture imposed by the adaptive problems faced by Pleistocene hunter-gatherers, is that we have no trouble under- standing, and indeed positively enjoy watching, types of behaviour that Pleistocene hunter-gatherers could never have seen.

Young children have no difficulty with watching animals that can talk, people that can fly, change shape or turn into animals. If their young minds were solely adapted to the structure of the real (Pleistocene) world, surely children should not enjoy and laugh at their car- toons, but be confused, indeed terrified by them. But they are not. The mind seems to be infinitely flexible in the types of behaviour and entities it can imagine and believe to exist. It is not just our common sense that counters the claims of the evolutionary psychologists. So too does the whole foundation of social anthropology. Consider, for instance, our understanding of modern foragers, those people whose lifestyles most closely resemble those of the Pleistocene. When we consider societies such as the !Kung or Inuit, it is impossible to identify any boundaries between different aspects of behaviour. For instance, where does the social behaviour of hunter-gatherers start and finish? As anthropologists such as Tim Ingold (1992, 1993) and Nerit Birt-David (1992) have so effectively described, the natural world appears to be thought of in precisely the same terms as other humans beings. When foragers hunt, or gather plants&gt;, or make tools, they are engaging as much in so- cial activity as in non-social pursuits. Indeed many of the major themes of social anthropology, such as totem- ism (Willis 1990), exist simply because there is a cog- nitive fluidity between the types of activities that evol- utionary psychologists would like to partition into dif- ferent domains, such as the social and natural worlds. All activities by hunter-gatherers are so deeply en- twined, conflated and embedded within each other that the identification of any discrete behavioural domains, such as 'social behaviour' or 'hunting behaviour' or 'tool making behaviour', is simply impossible (Mithen 1 996a). The evidently non-domain-specific character of the hunter-gatherer mind has been most effectively de- scribed by Ernest Gellner (1988, 45-46): 'The confla- tion and confusion of functions, aims and criteria' he stated, 'is the normal, original condition of mankind ... the conflated meanings constitute for him, a single and indivisible semantic content'. Gellner was writing about verbally expressed statements; but precisely the same interpretation must hold for the actions and the material culture of hunter-gatherers. There are no discrete beha- vioural domains; and as such there can be no discrete cognitive domains. Social anthropology tells us that the mind cannot be like a Swiss Army knife. We have, therefore, a major confrontation between the model of the mind proposed by the evolutionary psychologists, for which substantial evidence can be found in various areas of psychology, and the model of the mind which is both intuitively most reasonable and which is evident from social anthropology. How can these two positions be resolved? The answer may well lie in looking to that data set which is so frequently ignored by both social anthropologists and evolutionary biologists/psychologists: the archaeological record of the Pleistocene. The Middle/Upper Palaeolithic transition One of the major features of that archaeological record is what is known as the Middle/Upper Palaeolithic ttan- sition. This transition, occurring between 60-30,000 years ago, is constituted by a complex geographical and temporal mosaic of behavioural change. For instance the colonization of Australia probably at c.50,000 years ago, is accepted as a feature of the Upper Palaeolithic. So too is the first appearance of art, at c.35,000 years ago in Europe, although it may have also been created by the first Australians. In many different regions of the Old World, the first tools made from organic materials, the first sites with clear spatial structure, and the first architecture only occur after 40,000 years ago. All of these many and varied behaviour changes have been well documented in recent research such as by Paul Mellars (1989) and Clive Gamble (Stringer &amp; Gamble 1993). The scale and extent of these behavioural changes have led some to argue that they must reflect a major change in the nature of cognition (e.g. Mellars 1989). It is not feasible that a mere change in social organiza- tion, or perhaps the invention of new tool types, could have had such a profound influence on almost every single aspect of past behaviour. So what sort of cogni- tive change may this have been? The appearance of modern language has been the most frequent answer (e.g. Davidson &amp; Noble 1989; Mellars 1989; Whallon 1989). The problem with this answer is that there is com- pelling evidence that language has a long evolutionary history. Pleistocene hunter-gatherers long before the transition are likely to have possessed a linguistic ca- pacity as complex as that which we use today. Perhaps the most important evidence for this is the discovery of a hyoid bone in a Neanderthal burial at Kebara cave in Israel, dating to c.63,000 years ago (Arensburg et al 1990). This, together with recent reconstructions of the vocal tract of Neanderthals, indicates a fully evolved capacity for language (Schepartz 1993): evidence fur- ther supported by the brain size of early humans, which implies that they were living in large group sizes for which language is likely to have been essential for maintaining social cohesion (Dunbar 1993). So if there is no discernible evidence for a cognitive change regarding language at the transition, what other features of the mind might be considered? Well, here we may find a resolution to the confrontation between the evolutionary psychologists with their domain-spe- cific view of the mind, and social anthropologists with their emphasis on cognitive fluidity. Does the Middle/Upper Palaeolithic transition mark a change in mental architecture from a domain-specific to a cogni- tively fluid architecture (Mithen 1993, 1 996b)? A domain-specific intelligence does indeed appear compatible with the nature of the archaeological record, and inferred behaviour, prior to the Upper Palaeolithic (Mithen 1995). For instance, if we consider the Nean- derthals of Europe we can see that they readily engaged in many complex patterns of behaviour - which would, according to the argument of Cosmides, have required specialized cognitive processes. But these complex acti- vities seem to have remained very unconnected to each other. The following arguments are all discussed at length in Mithen (1996b). The Neanderthal mind First consider the tool making abilities of Neanderthals. These were highly skilful when stone was being knapped. Neanderthals produced fine symmetrical handaxes using bifacial flaking, and they mastered the levallois technique (one side of the core flat and the other domed). Both of these require a significant degree of planning, the imposition of preconceived form, and the mental rotations of artefacts during the course of manufacture. These methods of stone knapping are at least as complex as those used by modern humans dur- ing the Upper Palaeolithic. They imply that the Nean- derthals had specialized cognitive processes for man- Science. Cambridge: Cambridge U.P. Bar-Yosef, 0. 1994.

Yet in spite of this, the tools they made remained relatively simple. Their most complicated hunting weapon, for instance, appears to have been no more than a single point hafted on a wooden shaft. Why didn't Neanderthals make multi-component hunting weapons which would have increased their foraging efficiency? Such multi-compo- nent weapons are pervasive among modern hunter-ga- therers, and particularly complex among those who live in high latitude environments, which are the most com- parable to those exploited by the Neanderthals. Another odd thing about Neanderthals in that they made such limited (if any) use of antler, ivory and bone as raw materials. The manner in which stone was worked shows that they had considerable manual dex- terity; the effectiveness of bone or antler as raw ma- terials for hunting weapons can clearly be seen among modern hunters, and those of the Upper Palaeolithic. Moreover, we know from the mortality patterns of Neanderthals that they were under considerable adap- tive stress (Trinkaus 1995) that could have been re- duced by more effective hunting weapons, either by de- signing multi-component weapons or using bone and antler as raw materials. Before we consider why Nean- derthals did neither of these, we must consider other features of the Neanderthal mind. We should attribute Neanderthals with a 'natural his- tory intelligence': a suite of content rich cognitive pro- cesses geared to understanding the behaviour and dis- tribution of natural resources, such as animals, plants and features of the landscape. The basis for doing this is simply the fact that Neanderthals survived in such a diverse range of glacial and interglacial environments, many of which would have been rich in carnivores. The glacial phases of the Pleistocene would have been par- ticularly challenging as there would have been a dearth of food supplies during the winter months. How were Neanderthals able to survive in such envi- ronments? As I noted above, Neanderthals did not have complex, multi-component tools which are essential to the lives of modern foragers in glaciated environments. Without such tools, Neanderthals are likely to have sur- vived partly by working very hard, which can be seen in the extent of physical stress evident from their bones, partly by having a complex social organization, and partly by possessing an extensive and detailed under- standing of natural history. This is also something that can be seen among modem foragers, who are natural historians par excellence (Mithen 1990). An under- standing of animal behaviour and the myriad range of environmental cues as to their location and movements (such as hoofprints) is essential if one is to survive on game, whether that game is hunted or scavenged. We have good evidence that Neanderthals were doing both of these, and we should be in no doubt that they had specialized cognitive processes devoted to under- standing the natural world. We should also attribute to Neanderthals an advanced social intelligence - a suite of cognitive processes used for developing friendships and alliances, for use in de- ception and cunning in social strategies, and for infer- ring what other members of their groups were thinking and how they were likely to behave. Chimpanzees ap- pear to display a specialized social intelligence of this type, apparently more advanced than they exhibit in other domains of behaviour (Byrne 1995; Mithen 1 996b) and consequently a discrete domain of social in- telligence seems to have arisen early in human evol- ution. Advanced levels of social intelligence are essential if primates (hominid or otherwise) are to live within large groups (Dunbar 1993). Various lines of evidence indi- cate that Neanderthals were doing so. For instance, the environmental conditions of Pleistocene Europe during the glaciated phases, notably the high degrees of preda- tion risk and the availability of food in large, but ir- regularly distributed 'packages' (i.e. carcasses) are pre- cisely those which are know to favour the formation of large group sizes (Mithen 1994). In addition, by using a significant correlation between group size and brain size among extant primates, it has been possible to pre- dict that Neanderthals were living in groups of an aver- age size of 148 members (Aiello &amp; Dunbar 1993). Whether or not this specific figure is correct, we can be confident that Neanderthals lived within large groups and that they possessed an advanced level of social in- telligence to have done so. Having established this, another behavioural paradox becomes evident. Modern foragers mediate their social relations using items of material culture, such as beads and pendants. These are used for sending social mess- ages and as such greatly facilitate social interaction. But even though we can be confident that Neanderthals were able to make complex artefacts, and employed complex social strategies, material culture appears to have played no role in social interaction. No beads or pendants were made. No social messages were invested in their stone tools. It is evident, therefore, that with regard to cognitive processes involved in the manufacture of stone arte- facts, the exploitation of the natural world, social inter- action and language, Neanderthals appear to be little different to modern humans. So how can we explain all the things that Neanderthals did not do, but which are essential features of the behavioural repertoire of mod- ern humans when living as hunter-gatherers? Why didn't Neanderthals make specialized, multi-component hunting weapons, or use bone or antler as raw ma- terials, or invest their tools with social information, or make items of personal ornamentation, or indeed any types of art at all? And we can ask precisely the same questions about other types of Middle Palaeolithic hominids, such as the early anatomically modern hu- mans from the Near East who left an archaeological record barely distinguishable from that of the Neander- thals (Bar-Yosef 1994). From a domain specific to a cognitively fluid mentality There is, I think, a relatively straightforward explana- tion for the behavioural paradoxes of early humans, who seem to be so much like us (or at least modem hunter-gatherers) in some respects, and so different in others: they had a domain specific mentality. Prior to the start of the Upper Palaeolithic the mind appears to have been like a Swiss army knife (Figure 1). A series of specialized devices - the technical, natural history and social intelligences, and the linguistic capacity - housed within a single case. These devices of the mind seem to have been truly independent from each other, for the types of behaviour absent from the Middle Pal- aeolithic repertoire are just those which required the in- tegration of cognitive processes found within more than one domain (Mithen 1 996b). Consider the manufacture of complex, specialized hunting weapons dedicated to killing specific types of animals in specific contexts. To make these, one needs to integrate what one knows about animal behaviour with what one knows about making stone artefacts. One Gibson &amp; T. Ingold, pp. 429-445. Cambridge: Cambridge U.P.

But during the Middle Palaeolithic, thought about these appears to have been undertaken in separate cognitive domains. The integration of knowledge about animals and tools to make specialized hunting weapons did not - could not - occur. Similarly to make beads and pendants which carry social messages requires an ability to integrate aspects of social and technical intel- ligence, something beyond the domain specific men- tality of Middle Palaeolithic humans. All of the behaviours absent from the Middle Palae- olithic behavioural repertoire become evident after the transition to the Upper Palaeolithic (Figure 2). This transition appears to make a dramatic increase in the extent of accessibility between cognitive domains. The cognitive fluidity of the modem mind, the study of which is the cornerstone of social anthropology, ap- pears to have arisen only c.50,000 years ago, an ex- tremely recent date in human evolution. This appears to resolve the confrontation between the evolutionary psychologists' view of the mind, and that which we intuitively feel and find supported by social anthropology. The mind is no longer like a Swiss Army knife, but it has indeed been built on a domain-specific mental architecture the basis of which took millions of vpers tn evnlve When the Puvniltinnnrv ncvtnhnnaiGctc claim to have identified a domain-specific architecture in the modem mind, what they have really exposed is the deeply underlying mental structure. Like good ar- chaeologists, they have excavated the mind and looked below the surface. There they have found a series of specialized mental modules which had, as they pre- dicted, been gradually built up by the processes of evol- ution in which natural selection is likely to have played a major role. Our intuition only sees the surface, the most recent cognitive development, the cognitive fluidity that arose just 50,000 years ago (Figure 3). But it is this cognitive fluidity that make us so different from other animal species, for it allows us to do things such as thinking of animals as people (the basis of an- thropomorphism) and people as animals (the basis of totemism). Before concluding, I must briefly introduce one fur- ther thread to the argument that has so far been mis- sing. This is the process of cognitive development. Whereas the young child growing up within a Pleis- tocene hunter-gatherer society may have developed specialized domains for thinking about tool manufac- ture, or natural history, and if this was a post-Middle Palaeolithic child a cognitive fluidity would have de- veloped between these, the cognitive domains of the modem mind partly reflect our cultural context. This argument has been most powerfully made by Annette Karmiloff-Smith in her 1992 book Beyond Modularity: A Developmental Perspective on Cognitive Science. She argues that there are indeed hard wired mental modules within the mind which are products of evolution such as an intuitive psychology and an intuitive physics - these are the type of mental models that Cosmides &amp; Tooby refer to. But these act as a mere 'kick start' to the development of specialized cognitive domains, the nature of which are partly influenced by one's cultural environment. Consequently, within a hunter-gatherer society a do- main for natural history intelligence may develop. Within a child in our society, however, a specialized domain for 'mathematics' may develop, even though Pleistocene hunter-gatherers did not engage in mathe- matics. Each individual may indeed be thought of as developing their own unique domain-specific mental architecture, arising from a series of shared mental mo- dules, and the unique cultural circumstances within which they live. Karmiloff-Smith argues that the minds of young children are indeed dominated by a domain- specific mentality, but that after the age of around four a cognitive fluidity arises between these domains. To quote her, 'knowledge becomes applicable beyond the special purpose goals for which it is normally used and perceptual links across domains can be forged' (1994, ed. S. Carey &amp; R. Gelman.

Quite clearly I see an important analogy between these process of cognitive development in the child and the process of cognitive evolution of Homo, but (thank- fully) space is too short in this article to get into the knotty issue of the extent to which ontogeny recapitu- lates phylogeny. If we return to the type of cognitive domains that arise in a hunter-gatherer cultural context, we can see that cognitive fluidity had immense adaptive value. For instance, it allows the production of artefacts such as specialized hunting weapons. It enables one to attribute human-like minds to animals and improve one's abil- ities at predicting their behaviour. The appearance of cognitive fluidity transforms social relations, for it allows these to be mediated by material culture and the natural world. It also allows the mind to create brand- new ways of thinking, simply by combining processes from different domains, and to imagine all sorts of en- tities that violate domain boundaries, whether these be mythical beings or simply Donald Duck. And a vast amount of these new types of thoughts and behaviour will have no direct adaptive value. In summary, it is because of cognitive fluidity that functions, aims and criteria of human actions are, as Gellner stated, so confused and conflated. It is because of this that evolutionary psychology has only a limited contribution to make to our understanding of the mod- ern mind and culture. Social anthropology remains safe from this second onslaught from the biological sciences, having already survived the sociobiologists of the 1970s. But while they may have failed to provide an adequate model for the modern mind, evolutionary psychologists appear to have made a major contribution to prehistoric archaeology. Using the power of analogy, with which the modern mind in uniquely endowed, it can be proposed that the Neanderthal mind was just like a Swiss Army knife. O</page></plain_text>
