<plain_text><page sequence="1">Figures Beyond the Text: A Theory of Readable Character in the Novel STEVEN COHAN What do we mean when we expect a character to be readable enough to stimulate an interaction of some kind between the text of a novel and its reader? Most efforts to define "readable character" turn to the novel's realist tradition of psychological representation, but I want to propose a different and more flexible approach to this important question. I want to argue that character is readable when the text and its reader work together to promote the representational figure's transformation into a virtual existent. In the text itself character is embedded in a discourse which presents the human figure as a subject in its own right. Thus the strong appeal of character as a psychological representation. But through the reader's active participation in the text he collaborates with it to experience character as something more: an object of his perception. The virtual existence of character results from the construction of the figure as subject-as-object in the reader's own imaginative space. Regardless of the referential identity the figure means to signify in the discourse, character is actually readable because of its virtual identity, which in effect promotes an imaginative gestalt for the figure, "a unitary whole of varying degrees of rich- ness of detail, which, by virtue of its intrinsic articulation and structure, possesses coherence and consolidation and, thus, detachs itself as an organized and closed unit from the surrounding field." 1 Character is therefore readable, not as a representation, but as a coherently perceived figure existing, during the reading act, in the imaginative space produced in the reader's mind by the transmission of that figure (the text's coded instructions for perceiving it as a figure) and its reception (the reader's acting upon those instructions to imagine it as a figure). A perspective of the sort I have in mind is necessary if we are to understand what we require of character in our effort to read it, but this orientation is one which criticism has only begun to delineate. Seymour Chatman recognizes the need for "an open theory of character" which can push our concerns beyond the matter of "plot functions" to "argue that character is reconstructed by the audience from evidence announced or implicit in an original construction and communicated by the discourse . .. ." 2 We cannot arrive at such a desirable "open theory," however, until we put into place the representationalism implied by the conventional function of the human figure. Chatman himself, in response to his important question, "What is it that we reconstruct," finally resorts to a 1 Aron Gurwitsch, The Field of Consciousness (Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 1964), p. 115. 2 Seymour Chatman, Story and Discourse: Narrative Structure in Fiction and Film (Ithaca: Cornell Uni- versity Press, 1978), p. 119.</page><page sequence="2">NOVEL FALL 1983 psychological model, defining "character" as "a paradigm of traits." These traits, for Chatman, imply the psychology of the figure, one organized around the reve- lation of behavior.3 Likewise, Tzvetan Todorov attempts to define "character" as more than a cipher, as more than the product of "referential linguistic forms" or "the agent of a series of actions." But he too can do so only by equating the human sign with the psychological reality it signifies. "[While] not every character has a character, so to speak," Todorov explains, ". . . as soon as psychological determinism appears in the text, the fictional character becomes endowed with character: he acts in a certain way, because he is shy, weak, courageous, etc. There is no such thing as character without determinism of this type." 4 Why is it so difficult for narratologists like Chatman and Todorov to define "character" from a perspective that respects the convention of "psychological determinism" without requiring it or, and this is usually the case, becoming synonymous with it? Surely we all nod our heads in agreement at the familiar observation that character is a character with character; but in doing so we end where we began and, like the tramps waiting for Godot, stand still in the process of getting there. So why can't we avoid this snare of tautology when it comes to a theory of character? Much of what we customarily attribute to the significance of character as the primary human referent in a novel's text-the point of instigation for the reader's own construction of the text as a fictive world-has become equated with the example of nineteenth-century realism, which orients its representation of experience around character as an intelligible psychology. Though George Levine argues that the disruptive texts of realism actually predict modernism, about character he sees a departure: "The Victorian realist . . . puts primary emphasis on character; and the shift of emphasis from character is part of the whole transformation away from realism." 5 If we associate the function of character with the program of realism, as Levine does, then we place our emphasis on too limited an area of inquiry and remain with Chatman and Todorov, defining character as a "paradigm of traits." Most critics seem unwilling to move any further, however, so character and psychological representation stay joined together as the Siamese twins of novel theory. Realism in particular seems to epitomize the "psychological deter- minism" of character because it shouts its "insistence," to quote Leo Bersani, "on the readability of personality." 6 As a result of this assumption, Bersani argues, "Behavior in realistic fiction is continuously expressive of character. Apparently random incidents neatly carry messages about personality; and the world is thus at least structurally congenial to character, in the sense that it is constantly proposing to our intelligence objects and events which contain s Chatman, pp. 119, 126. 4 Tzvetan Todorov, "Reading as Construction," trans.

But this conservative line of reasoning, typical of critics when they approach the question of character in the novel no matter what radical theory of fiction they may otherwise advance, obscures the imaginative function of character by making it a primary avenue of entrance into the debate over the merits of realism as a mode of representation and, hence, as a psychological ideology. Responses of this sort to the problem of character generally fall into one of three camps. The first includes humanists such as W. J. Harvey, Christopher Gillie, John Bayley, and Martin Price, who defend the importance of character by appealing to the mimetic values of realist fiction.11 The second includes structuralists such as Chatman and Todorov, who describe these values as "components" of narrative while not responding to them as values at all. The third includes post-structuralists such as Bersani and Helene Cixous, who follow the models of Barthes and Lacan to claim, in Cixous's. words, that "'character' is the product of a repression of subjectivity." 12 By thus challenging realism as a bogus ideology, this third camp calls into question the identifying function of character as something "to be figured out, understood, read," since "The ideology underlying this fetishization of 'character'" works only to produce a "marketable" text for consumption by a conservative, bourgeois audience, one so committed to the values of stability and coherence in reality that it seeks confirmation of these values in its fiction.l3 When placed in this critical arena, character functions-comfortably, indiffer- ently, or deviously-as a psychological microcosm of the text itself as a representation, and a debate of this sort only misdirects our attention. From whichever side of the arena we look, the readability of character still seems to require, for good or ill, that the figure be a transparent grid-a personality for the 7 Bersani, p. 53. 8 Bersani, p. 69. 9 Bersani, p. 214. 10 Bersani, p. 69. 11 W.

Although we do need to recognize the limitation of this critical orientation towards character, we still cannot ignore the figure's referentiality altogether, and I am not proposing that we do so. Character does point to a human referent, for as readers we rely on the figure's being more than a series of linguistic signals encoding it in the text so that we can respond to it as an imaginative construction of human reality; and this is the case even with characters in novels that openly defy realist conventions regarding intelligible personality. Granted, the modern- ist reaction to realism often focused on the representation of character, as in Virginia Woolf's celebrated attack on Arnold Bennett.14 Prodding of this sort, however, which encourages Levine to exclude character when it comes to charting realism's evolution into modernism, does not necessarily lead to Jonathan Culler's explanation of why characters in novels by writers such as Woolf "cannot be treated according to nineteenth-century models; they are nodes in the verbal structure of the work, whose identity is relatively precarious." 15 To understand character as "nodes in the verbal structure of the work" assigns to it the same textual status as rhetoric, and this designation claims to eliminate from the human figure its representational human status entirely. Now character becomes, in Martin Price's words, "at most the constellated form of image patterns, historical allusions, philosophic themes." 16 Yet Price, like Culler, overstates the case. Even the rhetoric of a modernist text must somehow be leading us beyond the text, past its verbal nodes to an imaginary space in the reader's mind. Otherwise how could Culler put forth his claim that the "identity" of character in modernist fiction "is relatively precarious"? In other words, if we follow Culler, first to conceive of character as a verbal node, then as an identity, however precarious its representation, we find ourselves once again moving away from the text-the discourse-to imagine the human referent of the text-the character whose identity is somehow created by that discourse. However we approach it, character sustains an imaginative position superior to and yet not detached from the text's discourse, because of the figure's claim of referentiality, whatever stylized form that claim may take. So the question remains, especially when prompted by contemporary fiction and its challenge to "psychological determinism": can we examine character as a figure projecting an identity without necessarily relying upon realism's psychological model to define the imaginary dimensions of that identity as the text both promotes and grounds it? Todorov, I think, isolates our problem somewhat when he observes that a character may actually lack a character in the psychological sense of the word. To begin with, he points out, "In and of itself the fictional character [at first evoked by a text's linguistic reference to an anthropomorphic being] has 14 Virginia Woolf, "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown" (1924), rpt.

To examine the inherent readability of character, then, we need to locate our orientation not in the psychological grounding of realism (representationalism) or in the aesthetic grounding of modernism (self-reflexivity), but in that crucial space between the text and its reader. For it is here that the coherence of character as a virtual existent comes into play. II Wolfgang Iser's explanation of the reading process in phenomenological terms has begun to map out clear directions leading us to that space between text and reader, which I see as the location where we can understand character as an imaginative construction that does not necessarily depend upon the require- ment of intelligible psychological representation. Iser approaches reading as an act of ideation, a concept he derives from Husserl. According to Iser the text itself relies on its own indeterminacy-those implicit areas in the discourse he identifies as "gaps" or "blanks," as well as the more explicit areas he calls "negations"-to force the reader's active participation, so that he can experience the aesthetic dimension of the text by ideating its content. Communication in literature, then, is a process set in motion and regulated not by a given code but by a mutually restrictive and magnifying interaction between the explicit and the implicit, between revelation and concealment.... Blanks and negations both control the process of communication in their own different ways: the blanks leave open the connections between perspectives in the text, and so spur the reader into coordinating these perspectives-in other words, they induce the reader to perform basic operations within the text. The various types of negation invoke familiar or determinate elements only to cancel them out. What is canceled, however, remains in view, and thus brings about modifications in the reader's attitude toward what is familiar or deter- minate-in other words, he is guided to adopt a position in relation to the text.18 From this engagement the reader produces his sense of the work's coherence, to see it emerging from beneath the textual manifestations of indeterminacy. Ultimately Iser has in mind a distinction between the interpretation and the reception of the text regarding its coherence, and I will be referring to that 17 Todorov, p. 77. 18 Wolfgang Iser, The Act of Reading: A Theory of Aesthetic Response (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1978), pp. 168-69. 9</page><page sequence="6">NOVELIFALL 1983 part of his theory later. But first I want to emphasize what he explains about a text's appeal to its reader to construct a virtual world out of the discourse, which itself embeds that world-along with its potential for readerly ideation-entirely in words. The text stimulates the reader's imagination by heightening blank or negational spaces to interrupt the discourse's appearance of straight-forward semantic content. Blanks and negations draw the reader into the virtual world encoded within the text, because the discordances they generate appeal to his imagination to smooth the sudden ruptures or to fill the unexpected gaps. The reader himself provides the missing connections or accounts for the reversals of conventional strategies in the text's "repertoire," which can include character as a representational figure. Once he constructs this virtual space in his mind and enters it imaginatively, the reader "makes conceivable that which has not been formulated" in the text itself,19 and this activity includes not only the assemblage of "meaning" but also the construction of a character's identity as a virtual existent. Consequently, since the reader experiences a virtual reality that exists only so long as it is perceived as a coherent structure in his imagination, the act of reading, according to Iser, stimulates an experience of "irrealization, in the sense that we are preoccupied with something that takes us out of our own given reality." 20 This latter point I want to emphasize in particular. Iser's explanation of the reading process as an act of irrealization provides us with a useful framework for understanding character as an imaginative construction, what I have been calling a "virtual existent." But at the same time some redirection of Iser's theory is in order, for in the long run his discussion works to minimize the imaginative dynamic of irrealization occurring through the reader's contact with the text. Although his model of the reading act begins with the text's indeterminacy stimulating mental images in the reader's mind, Iser tends to equate such images with ideas, thereby emphasizing the text's appeal to the reader's intellect above all else. Whenever he applies his model to a particular text he ends up sub- ordinating the reader's experience of irrealization to the achievement of intellec- tual comprehension, so the illustrations he cites to demonstrate his theory of reading do not fully sample its imaginative dimensions as a virtualizing activity. Yet the advantage of Iser's model for our purposes is that it does move us beyond an exclusive concern with comprehension, even though he himself does not make full use of this potential. To build a theory of character from Iser's model we therefore need to extend its application and its emphasis beyond his own concern with intellectual comprehension as the goal of reading. The intellect certainly does not remain passive while reading, but that is not the sole area of the reader's mind stimu- lated by the text. Reading fiction is, finally, an act of imaginative perception that calls into play more than the reader's intellect to serve more interests than that of comprehension alone, because the reader's engagement with the human figure requires that he bring to bear upon the text a variety of imaginative resources: 19 Iser, p. 139. 20 Iser, p. 140. 10</page><page sequence="7">STEVEN COHAN READABLE CHARACTER only then can he experience the fictive world as a virtual reality while reading. The reader's construction of the text as a virtual reality transports the figure and its world from the text to that "irrealized" space in his own mind, which exists beyond the realm of discourse. The value of Iser's model, then, is that it asks us to recognize how the process of constructing the figure's virtual existence, while grounded by the text and performed by the reader, actually occurs neither in the text, though the conventions of narration make it appear otherwise, nor in the reader's own "given reality," for any stimulus from outside the text will intrude upon the activity of irrealization to disrupt it, but rather in what I have called the imaginative space between the two, which materializes in the reader's mind. Let me begin to illustrate the orientation I am proposing for our understanding of character as a readable figure by looking at a few examples of my own. One of the most self-conscious, not to say outrageous, instances of a text's appeal to its reader to enter that imaginative space beyond the text occurs in Tristram Shandy. Tristram announces that he will describe the Widow Wadman (to give her a content, so to speak), but then provides instead two blank pages with these instructions: "Sit down, Sir, paint her to your own mind-as like your mistress as you can-as unlike your wife as your conscience will let you-'tis all one to me-please but your own fancy to it." 21 Even though Tristram confesses that what his reader may choose as filler for this quite literal blank may be "all one" to him, since he equates the two blank pages with a transparency, elsewhere Sterne's text does implicitly direct our ideation of the Widow's character, as later revealed by her vigorous pursuit of innocent Uncle Toby, to determine what we, as collaborating readers, may put down upon those two blank pages without ignoring the text altogether. Their context in the entire work, then, already starts to fill those pages with invisible script, despite Tristram's claim that we have our own fancy-not to say our own lived experience-at our disposal to make the text itself, in essence, disappear from view as a text. Now we should not take Sterne's joke lightly. First of all, it reminds us how much the creation of character in a novel seems to depend upon the text's dis- course and its representationality, which fill that empty space with a content for the Widow's otherwise blank figure. If character were just a blank page we would be at a loss, for we would literally have nothing to read. But too, this joke makes us realize that a reader does indeed bring something of his own experience-his imagination-to a novel: the character is actually a blank space in that the figure exists solely in the reader's imagination, not in the text, so these two pages in Tristram Shandy invite us as readers to enter an extra-textual space in our own heads. Just how do we get there? It is not the description or explanation of behavior, that "paradigm of traits" exhibited by the figure, which necessarily transforms the Widow into an imaginative gestalt, a figure whose identity we can imagine. Rather, her behavior with Uncle Toby instigates a coded set of instructions that determine our options for what we see her as, by foregrounding some "traits," 21 Laurence Sterne, Tristram Shandy, ed. James Aiken Work (New York: Odyssey Press, 1940), p. 470. 11</page><page sequence="8">12 NOVELJFALL 1983 precluding others, in the process supplying us with enough clues so as to distin- guish figure from narrative background. "If what we call 'identity' were not anchored in a constant relationship with environment," Gombrich claims in Art and Illusion, "it would be lost in the chaos of swirling impressions that never repeat themselves." 22 In this example the Widow's behavior, set in contrast to that of the other characters, provides us with such an environment for singling out her figure (and for laughing, too, at what we discover). "Character," Todorov asks us to remember, "is a compromise between difference and repeti- tion," 23 so our construction of the Widow as a virtual existent depends on both. We need to find an attribute of difference in her figure, in order to identify it as a distinct figure (the Widow as opposed to Mrs. Shandy, say), and one of repetition, in order to keep locating that distinct figure in the imaginative field whenever we come upon references to her in the narrative. These two attributes, however, need not necessarily be translated into the psychological discourse of behavior. Rhetoric, of the sort Dickens's novels rely upon, works just as well. There the textual assertion of a peculiar rhetorical description proceeds, in one breath, to define the sameness indentifiable with the figure and to establish its difference from other figures, for the specific trope be- comes so vivid in our minds that it seems inseparable from the figure it sup- posedly means only to describe as a piece of discourse. Recall, for instance, Mrs. Snagsby in Bleak House. She is not a very important character in the novel. E.M. Forster would have called her a "flat" character, one who does not surprise us because her behavior follows a predictable, unvarying pattern. In this respect, she lacks a character as Todorov defines the word: there is little "psychological determinism" operating upon her figure. But while Mrs. Snagsby may lack dimension as a psychological representation, she is still quite vivid as an imaginative figure. Dickens's text establishes Mrs. Snagsby's potential for a virtual existence from the moment it first introduces her. She is "short," we are told, with a "compressed" waist, but most of all it is her nose that should command our attention. She has "a sharp nose like a sharp autumn evening, inclined to be frosty towards the end." 24 Here Mrs. Snagsby's nose stands in for her entire personality. The discourse renders her as little more than a rhetorical device, synecdoche, in much the same way that the luminous reflection of something on water is suggested on a canvas of Monet's by brush strokes and dabs of colors: bits and pieces produce the optical (or virtual) illusion of a representational whole. Dickens's rhetoric similarly invites us to collaborate with it to complete the image, to make of Mrs. Snagsby something more than the sum of the few words affixing her to the text. The sharpness of a frosty autumn evening connotes a range of sensation larger than the actual subject matter of this descriptive statement-her nose-would suggest, releasing for our imaginations a sense of 22 E.H.

Evoking a concrete visual image of the woman's nose through the simile of an autumn evening, the discourse first encourages us to use observations from our own experience to see Mrs. Snagsby as something physical-an imaginatively visual figure, in possession of a face and a body as well as a nose-and then as something more intangible as well- the shrill-tempered woman sporting this sharp and frosty nose. In other words, as we read we follow a direction encoded in the text to see the character, not as words, but as an eidetic image, "Mrs. Snagsby," and the words have led us into filling in the blank established by the synecdoche, so we supply the visual pieces that the discourse itself does not explicitly provide. Since discourse, even as a spur towards representation, can only offer us a metonymic exposition of a figure, we have to participate in the character's construction, much as Tristram invites us to do with the Widow Wadman, by completing the instruction encoded in the partial description to achieve a more complete actualization of the figure's virtual presence in our minds. Indeed, the inability to do just that, to construct a virtual existence-an eidos-for the figure, may well discourage a reader from turning to novels for pleasure, as a student confessed to me, when he explained that he could not respond to characters in a novel as more than "words," unless he had originally seen a film version of it.25 Mrs. Snagsby's existence therefore depends upon our constructing her as a virtual presence according to the direction encoded in the text's condensation of her figure into metonymic and metaphoric discourse. Throughout our reading of Bleak House we continue to think of her as a "flat" character only because Dickens's text does not change or extend the coding for our construction of her virtual existence. As an imaginative figure she is not "flat" at all; she just remains limited to the same "sharp" note trumpeted every time she appears. Our sense of her as a virtual existent distinguished from other such figures in Bleak House consequently develops without further variation because of the text's repetition of its initial direction. Grounded by a discourse which keeps her potential for virtual existence couched in a recurring type of rhetorical description, our ideation of her figure now remains consistent; it is continually reinforced by Dickens's narration (and her own dialogue) but not extended any further. If this were to remain the only type of direction for our construction of the figures in Dickens's text, we would not be able to sustain our interest in them for long, and Bleak House is very long. For an extension of our engagement with the figures in Dickens's novel we can, of course, turn to Esther. The text provides us with a more dimensional (and more psychologically representational) range of direction for Esther's figure. This is a rather conventional means of readerly engagement with a figure's 25 Iser argues how such passivity on my student's part would work against his imaginative engagement with a novel's text. In his case the supposed "optical enrichment" of a filmic treatment, whose actors make the figures visually determinate, actually excludes him from an active role in the production of the figures as mental images, so that the figures are perceived entirely within their own space, inhibiting an effort on his part to collaborate in their construction (see Iser, pp. 138-39). 13</page><page sequence="10">NOVELIFALL 1983 virtual existence. More revealing for our purposes, and more crucial to Dickens's text itself, is Lady Dedlock. The text seems to provide very little helpful direction when it comes to Lady Dedlock, especially in contrast to the more complete psychological representation of her daughter. This contrast in and of itself establishes a blank that draws us towards Lady Dedlock's figure, and the dis- course encourages our interest because it instructs us to envision her not in a "melting" but in a "freezing" mood of inanimation and indolence,26 as a further pointed contrast to the obsessive, manic energy of the other characters, such as Mrs. Snagsby. Lady Dedlock is not a cipher, yet neither is she "round" in Forster's psycho- logical definition of that term. Because she is not explained psychologically by the text's discourse, we construct her figure much in the way we do Mrs. Snagsby's. In this case, however, the discourse as a whole supplies the metonymic reference that stimulates our imaginative construction of her virtual existence. In contrast to Esther, whose history the text documents to encourage our under- standing of her figure as it was psychologically determined by her childhood, Lady Dedlock shows how little character need depend upon psychological dis- course of that sort to activate our imaginative construction of the figure as a virtual existent. Lady Dedlock, the most psychologically elusive of the characters in Bleak House, is, along with Tulkinghorn, actually the most imaginatively compelling, precisely because she seems so blank a page as a "person." To read her character we need to look between the lines of the text with greater pene- tration and more imaginative engagement than we need to do in order to ideate an existence for Esther or Mrs. Snagsby. For much of Bleak House Lady Dedlock seems opaque, masked, her face not a mirror of her personality, as it is for Mrs. Snagsby. The text presents Lady Dedlock to us through a series of aristocratic poses ruptured infrequently by an emotional outburst. Whenever the narration allows us to glimpse the heat smoldering beneath the icy exterior it only draws us further into the text in an attempt to penetrate her usual indifference to account for that volatile contrast of "freezing" and "melting" moods. In other words, we try to interpret her as a character in the psychological sense by completing the missing psycho- logical discourse ourselves. The plot, it would seem, provides us with some explanation of her behavior; but when all is said and done it actually gives us very little to go on, since her relationship with Hawdon remains shrouded in unanswered questions about her past. All we have to rely on for our knowledge of her history is what Tulkinghorn reports, and the sinister tone of his veiled explanation in Chapter 40 makes what he says suspect. So with this the case we go beyond the discourse about her to find our way, to coordinate her lack of animation to the recurring images of disease, or to the problem of sexual repression, or to the spiritual bankruptcy of a moneyed class, all three very standard explanations of her "character." No matter how we do try to account for her presence in the novel, however, Lady Dedlock remains a puzzle, a blank, psychologically indeterminate, but 26 Dickens, p. 13. 14</page><page sequence="11">STEVEN COHANIREADABLE CHARACTER nevertheless very readable. Whatever psychological content we try to imagine for her out of the text's grounding of her figure in a representational world traumatized by sex, class, and money, Lady Dedlock's "frozen" personality makes her anything but a statue in our minds, as the variety of explanations for her behavior testifies. Because her figure is grounded by ellipses it pulls us through the text, first to focus the emotional tensions that make the text itself so imaginatively compelling, and then to draw these tensions into our own readerly space. Thus she well serves her text's reception, not as a psychological representation, but as a virtual existent; for what we end up doing for her figure is to supply ourselves the passionate energy which the text implicitly directs us to see there in her figure but which it resists addressing in the discourse about her except in the most conditional of phrasing to emphasize how masked she is even to the omnipresent narrative voice. When we do finally watch her passions erupt in Chapters 41 and 55, we find confir- mation of the volatile energy we have been imagining between the lines of the elusive discourse about her, and more encouragement to continue doing so. For even in these two scenes, while the narration observes her in a display of passion, it relies mainly on the image of her unkempt hair "wildly thrown" and "wildly scattered" as a metaphoric reference to her mental disorder.27 We can conclude, then, that Lady Dedlock exists for our imaginations solely as the product of an incomplete discourse about her repressed energy; and for her figure to radiate that energy which she strains against, as her figure seems to do, we provide it in our imaginative conception of her, although we tend to attribute its presence to the text itself.28 In fact, however, the text only stimulates our imaginative production of her as a virtual figure suspended between those two extreme points of "freezing" and "melting." III The Widow Wadman, Mrs. Snagsby, Lady Dedlock, each figure lacks the degree of coherent psychological content we readily find in Emma Woodhouse, say, or Dorothea Brooke; and I have chosen these three "incomplete" characters as my initial examples for that very reason. Their resonance as human figures does not depend upon their being framed by a specific psychological discourse- whether articulated through an evolving sequence of actions to promote growth or a narrational account of growth-to make them imaginatively credible or readable. What I have wanted to emphasize through their example is that to understand character as a readable figure we need to distinguish between its psychological attributes as a representational figure and its phenomenological identity as an imagined figure. I have in mind when I stress this point the line drawn by phenomenologists 27 Dickens, pp. 513, 666. 28 Susan R. Horton agrees with what I am saying, although she concentrates on the text as a representation which affords the reader access to Dickens's imagination. "The great amount of energy that radiates from Dickens's novels is actually in part our own," Horton concludes. "Reading Dickens, finally, is a participatory sport." The Reader in the Dickens World: Style and Response (Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1981), p. 13. 15</page><page sequence="12">NOVEL|FALL 1983 between "the [perceived] thing as it really is," which we can roughly call the psychological reality character represents, and "the [perceived] thing as it appears and is experienced through the given act, and through that act alone," which we can similarly call the virtual identity a reader constructs for the character during the reading experience.29 This sharp distinction allows us to put the human figure's representationality in a perspective subordinate to the space between the text and its reader. When we conceive of the perceived figure's identity in this context-to comprehend what makes the figure identi- fiable enough to be perceived and experienced by the reader as a figure with a "content" that distinguishes it from other figures or grounds-we can then move beyond the matter of identity as a psychological content, for we are now conceiving of the figure as an imagined object as well as an imagined subject. Ordinarily the discourse of a novel seems to obscure this perspective. As a representational mode narration tends to blur a distinction between character as object and subject, because of the genre's particular richness in representing character as a bearer of consciousness. In the text as a representational mode character appears in the discourse as the subject of consciousness. As Dorrit Cohn quite rightly observes, "narrative fiction is the only literary genre, as well as the only kind of narrative, in which the unspoken thoughts, feelings, perceptions of a person other than the speaker can be portrayed." 30 Nevertheless, while that feeling of sharing another's consciousness seems very real in many novels, while it greatly contributes to the power such fictions have for readers, just as it activates, as well, the text's own claim as an intelligible psychological discourse-while the narration seems to do all of this, it actually deflects the imaginative reality of character as a figure experienced by the reader in a space beyond the text. Despite the discourse's encouragement, we are not intruders upon another's consciousness. That consciousness does not exist materially as consciousness, only as a discourse about consciousness. It therefore follows that the figure identified by the text's discourse as a subject of consciousness is also the object of our consciousness as readers of that discourse. Reading, after all, involves us in an act of consciousness that is stimulated by the text. As Iser puts it, "The ability to perceive oneself during the process of participation is an essential quality of the aesthetic experience; the observer finds himself in a strange, halfway position: he is involved and he watches himself being in- volved." 31 Like all acts of consciousness, this one too produces for the perceiver (the reader) a gestalt, "a universal, formal pattern of organization [for the perceived object as it appears to the perceiver], realized in every field of consciousness, regardless of content." 32 The text's narration of the figure's representational existence as a subject works with the reader's imaginative perception of the figure as an object to stimulate the reader's own double consciousness as subject (becoming involved 29 Gurwitsch, p. 170. 30 Dorrit Cohn, Transparent Minds: Narrative Modes for Presenting Consciousness in Fiction (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1978), p. 7. 31 Iser, p. 134. 32 Gurwitsch, p. 55. i6</page><page sequence="13">STEVEN COHANIREADABLE CHARACTER in the representation) and object (watching that involvement occur). Out of this double engagement the reader builds a similar double construction of character, the imagined figure as subject-as-object, which we can understand as two concurrent fields of readerly perception. For an illustration of this double construction consider Mrs. Dalloway. As a psychological representation Woolf's novel records, in James Naremore's phrase, "a world without a self." 33 Clarissa Dalloway's character seems to resist the conventional equation of identity with predictable continuities, for she appears to be a bundle of competing impressions. At times she sees herself as young or old, as female or male, as wife or virgin, as corporeal or ethereal. When we think of Clarissa as a representational figure, the subject of conscious- ness, her identity seems fluid, without shape. We do not ignore her feeling of "being laid out like a mist between the people she knew best, who lifted her on their branches as she had seen the trees lift the mist." 34 Nor do we minimize her belief that "our apparitions, the part of us which appears, are so momentary, compared with the other, the unseen part of us, which spreads wide" (p. 232). Although the self she assembles for presentation to her world must be "pointed; dartlike; definite" (p. 55), at bottom she senses something amorphous within her consciousness, something "invisible; unseen; unknown" (p. 14). The text of Woolf's novel renders Clarissa's sensation of fluidity and shape- lessness through its discourse about her. Here, for example, is the narration recounting one of those moments during which Clarissa feels her self spreading wide: Only for a moment; but it was enough. It was a sudden revelation, a tinge like a blush which one tried to check and then, as it spread, one yielded to its expansion, and rushed to the farthest verge and there quivered and felt the world come closer, swollen with some astonishing significance, some pressure of rapture, which split its thin skin and gushed and poured with an extraor- dinary alleviation over the cracks and sores! Then, for that moment, she had seen an illumination; a match burning in a crocus; an inner meaning almost expressed. But the close withdrew; the hard softened. It was over-the moment. (p. 47) This passage describing Clarissa's "sudden revelation" occurs in a paragraph that runs over two pages, but these five sentences stylistically enclose her moment of consciousness as a self-contained unit to draw us towards her figural space so that we experience the emotional intensity of her "illumination." The relatively brief first sentence, two independent clauses linked by a semi-colon, stands out in contrast to the lengthy sentences that precede it in the paragraph. The cadence of this sentence, a recurring syntactic structure in Woolf's prose, thus signals the opening of Clarissa's epiphany. The second sentence expands 33 James Naremore, The World without a Self: Virginia Woolf and the Novel (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1973). 34 Virginia Woolf, Mrs. Dalloway (New York: Harcourt, 1925), p. 12.

The third sentence then slows down the intensity of expression to relieve the tempo of the previous sentence; here the linking of three phrases with semi-colons makes the cadence somewhat weightier as a reflection of the waning of intensity and as a preparation for the moment's termination. The fourth sentence now repeats the syntax of the first to frame the epiphany, and the moment's closure is itself announced in the last and shortest, most straight-forward sentence of the five: "It was over-the moment." The style of this passage renders the intensity of Clarissa's revelation so that we imagine her as a figural subject, for it makes her consciousness known to us through a piece of discourse whose semantic content visibly mainfests itself in a syntactic pattern. When the rhythm of Woolf's syntax reflects Clarissa's epiphany as sensation, we seem to penetrate her consciousness even though she herself assumes it is "invisible; unseen; unknown." In doing so, we imagine what she experiences as a subject of consciousness, but we also experience a continuity heightening our sense of her as a figural object. The rhythm of expansion/contraction, which Clarissa feels as a moment of discontinuity and dissolution, is actually narrated in a style that carries us into the density of the moment while moving us beyond its specific psychological content because of its peculiar stylistic rendering. The syntactic reinforcement of Clarissa's conscious- ness in this passage does render the single moment quite vividly, but the style is also representative of the text's prose throughout. The passage, taken as dis- course, actually makes us perceive both the difference (this single moment) and the repetition (the recurring style) of Clarissa's experience. Woolf's prose conse- quently informs each isolated moment of psychological fragmentation with a principle of repetition and, hence, of continuity, for it gives to all such moments a similar stylistic identity in the discourse. The narration itself thus encourages us to see Clarissa's consciousness radiating from a continuous identity, what she thinks of as "one centre, one diamond . . . that diamond shape, that single person" (pp. 55-56), even though she herself fragments that centre. The text of Mrs. Dalloway, then, as opposed to the reality represented by the text, directs us to imagine Clarissa's figure as an object, so to construct an identity for her figure, we respect her own discontinuous psychological content but also go beyond it. In this sense do we construct her as subject-as-object to imagine her as a continuously identifiable virtual existent throughout our reading. We receive Clarissa's momentary selves as variations of a single virtual identity that seems continuous to our imaginations only because the text embeds the figural consciousness in discourse, in language, to encourage our perceiving the figure as subject-as-object. Clarissa's discontinuity as a figural subject is further balanced by her continuity as a figural object through the narrative's chronological sequence of a single day and its shifting viewpoint. Both the</page><page sequence="15">STEVEN COHANJREADABLE CHARACTER structure and the narration of the text direct our reading of Clarissa's figure so that she becomes imaginatively visible in our minds as an existent. As a figural subject Clarissa sustains a discontinuous psychological content, but the rhythm of variation in her consciousness, we discover as we proceed serially through the narrative, is itself the repetition of states of self-consciousness and self- effacement, of expansion and contraction, so the passage I cited offers us an example of the type of revelation she repeatedly experiences throughout the day. Within this pattern of expansion/contraction is her figure's own subjective (and representational) consciousness, which we construct as the object of our percep- tion, because the text instructs us to look beyond the individual moments which define her as a discontinuous subject. Being Clarissa's readers, we respond to such textual signals to move her figure beyond the temporal, psychological dimensions that otherwise restrict her to a representational human world. Only then can we take notice of her experienc- ing both difference and repetition to imagine her as subject and object. Since the narration's shifting viewpoint presents Clarissa as she sees her self, as she thinks others see her, and as others do see her, the text continually directs us to imagine her figure from this double perspective. Clarissa herself can momentarily experience the same degree of irrealization: "She sliced like a knife through everything; at the same time was outside, looking on" (p. 11). But whereas this double consciousness of her self as both subject and object lasts only a moment for Clarissa, we sustain it for the duration of our reading, because Woolf's viewpoint, which can even shift between authorial and figural perspec- tives in mid-sentence, insures our continual reception of Clarissa as subject-as- object, just as the prose style and the structure invite us to imagine the continuity and repetition underlying the discontinuity and difference that Clarissa experiences. In Mrs. Dalloway we achieve a type of readerly engagement that I want to offer as a model for our construction of character as a readable figure. The reader's own imaginative centralization of the character as a virtual existent overcomes without denying the fragmentation which the character herself may experience as a representation of reality. The reader consequently imagines the figure from two concurrent perspectives in relation to the text and its fictive impression of reality: the character as subject-as-object. Affixed to the discourse as the subject of consciousness, character renders the text as a representational world; whereas, at the same time, provoked by that discourse into becoming the object of the reader's perception, character stimulates the reader to transform the representational world into a virtual world, whose coherence he can perceive because the text instructs him to imagine virtually what it can only shape through words. When identifying this pattern as a model of readable character, however, we must also recognize that it works inversely just as well. The reticence of narration to penetrate consciousness in a novel, like the absence of narration in film or drama, does not necessarily impoverish our response. Far from it, as Lady Dedlock shows, since Dickens's narration treats her as a minimal 19</page><page sequence="16">20 NOVEL FALL 1983 subject. The more the discourse presents the figure as an object by not presenting its inner space as a subject through narration, the more it draws the figure into our space where we construct its identity as a subject, by and large just reversing the procedure I've described occurring through the narration of Mrs. Dalloway. In either case, the figure imagined as subject-as-object or as object-as-subject, we are working with the same dynamic that "enables us to produce an image of the imaginary object [the figure as a virtual existent], which otherwise has no existence of its own. . . . and because we are imagining and producing it, we are actually in its presence and it is in ours." 35 I am concentrating on narra- tion as the spur for our construction of the figure as a virtual existent because it is the mode of presenting character peculiar to the novel as a text; and since character in the novel so depends upon narration for its ground, the discourse can facilitate the ease with which we move the figure into our space, as in the examples of both Clarissa Dalloway and Lady Dedlock, or it can seem to thwart our imaginative possession of the figure, to underscore the pressures we exert upon the text. Consequently, the text's invitation to coordinate or separate these two perspectives-the figure as subject-as-object-works to determine our particular reception of the figure as a virtual existent. IV One might counter what I have been proposing by arguing that I can make my claim about the figure as subject-as-object in Mrs. Dalloway only because, in this particular instance, the text as Woolf constructed it assents to my readerly organization of its pieces of representation into an imaginative whole. For one thing, her style, I said, instructs us to do just that. To be sure, critics vary in the degree to which they are willing to accept fiction, in Iser's phrase, "as the gestalt of the imaginary," 36 what for our purposes we might term the imaginative ground encoded within the text that outlines character as a perceived figure (subject-as-object) and then promotes that figure's virtual existence for the reader. Chatman does believe that by definition a narrative manifests "discernible organization" or it would not be a narrative.37 Bersani, on the other hand, dis- agrees. He maintains that such manifestations of organization (he calls them "significant design" 38) work, especially when they concern character, to repress expressions of desire because they correlate the narrative field to a stable representation of the self. Thus he interprets the readability of character in the context of his dissatisfaction with representations of a structured self. "For what we are actually in its presence and it is in ours." 'n I am concentrating on narra- we call character," he concludes, "is also a partial self. Its appearance of completeness, of wholeness, may be nothing more than the illusion created by the centralizing of a partial self. Such centralization involves both the organization of our desires into psychic structures and the expulsion of nonstructurable desires. 3s Iser, p. 139. 36 Wolfgang Iser, "The Current Situation of Literary Theory: Key Concepts and the Imaginary," New Literary History 11 (1979), 17. 37 Chatman, p. 21. 38 Bersani, p. 52.</page><page sequence="17">STEVEN COHAN READABLE CHARACTER 21 Character, in short, is also a piece of a person; it has the factitious coherence of all obsessions." 39 Bersani, in other words, would argue, first, that the degree of coherence I claimed for the reader of Mrs. Dalloway depends upon an illusion of centrality asserted by the text itself, which ends up falsifying what the character herself experiences; and second, that the reader should only imagine this illusion of coherence if instructed to do so by the text's explicit narrative "design," its organization of experience as a discourse (here, in Woolf's text, through its style, structure, and viewpoint) advocating psychological coherence. I find that Bersani's explanation actually confuses the problem of "character" as a "centralized" figure. To begin with, he does not consider the important distinction between character as an object and as a subject of perception, which in the case of Mrs. Dalloway allows us to confront the fragmentation of self as a character experiences it and, at the same time, to move beyond what we normally consider to be the psychologically "real" (the self as a single self, as a subject) through the "irrealization" demanded of reading. In fact, this imaginative activity allows us to experience what Cixous, who responds to character much as Bersani does, wants from a radical literature: "space enough for everyone, for each more-than-one, and for each one of me." 40 In contrast to what I am claiming, Bersani lodges the question of the figure's coherence entirely inside the text's representationality, rather than beyond it, so his reasoning, like Cixous's, only encourages him to read character as a psycho- logical print-out and not as an imaginative configuration produced by the collusion of text and reader to coordinate objective and subjective fields into a virtual existence. Consequently, while he advocates an exciting, subversive "in- coherent" literature that deconstructs what he calls realism's production of "readable personality" to expand the scope of character, he treats the reader's role in that production-or, for that matter, in that deconstruction-much too lightly, attributing the pursuit of coherence, as far as the reader is concerned, to previous experiences of realistic fiction, and defining coherence only on psy- chological grounds: how a text represents consciousness through its character- ization of the figure as a stable representation of the self. So however he cuts his cake, Bersani still conceives of the text as a psychological discourse, whereas the interaction between the text and its reader, which actually produces that "appear- ance of completeness" for character in the reader's imagination, is more complex and versatile than Bersani allows. What needs to be explained here is the imaginative coherence we as readers strive for while reading character in order to construct the figure as a virtual existent distinct enough from its ground so that it can be experienced as subject and object. "Perception," Rudolf Arnheim explains, "can abstract objects from their context only because it grasps shape as organized structure, rather than recording it as a mosaic of elements." 41 With this in mind, then, we need to consider the degree to which the text must prompt such abstraction by embed- 39 Bersani, p. 313. 40 Cixous, p. 402. 41 Rudolf Arnheim, Visual Thinking (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1969), p. 41.</page><page sequence="18">NOVELJFALL 1983 ding within its own discourse a reflection of what the reader himself constructs in his imagination. Stanley Fish goes so far as to dislocate the reader's sense of coherence from the text's discourse entirely: "the place where sense is made or not made," he maintains, "is the reader's mind rather than the printed page or the space between the covers of a book." 42 This is indeed the case, as Iser's model proposes, but we still need to account for the stimulus which encourages the reader to make sense, to abstract shape as an organized structure, or which frustrates his attempt to do so. James Kincaid wonders if we attribute coherence as a principal insep- arable from narrative, as Chatman does, because we fear "logical contradiction." To assuage this implicit threat of a text's potential for contradiction, Kincaid believes that we hunt for "organizing patterns." Thus he postulates that a text, far from being a highly patterned or randomly arranged sequence, actually presents its reader with "a structure of mutually competing coherences," which he then tries to sort out, to organize, to totalize or centralize because of the very demands of reading as an act of perception and cognition.43 All this may be rather thorny brush to try to part, but once again Iser's model of the reading act may perhaps help clear our way. In addressing the matter of a reader's construction of "totality" from the text's own indeter- minacy, Iser delineates two areas of comprehension in the reading process, following Paul Ricoeur to distinguish the enterprise of achieving "meaning" from that of finding "significance." "Meaning," Iser explains, "is the refer- ential totality which is implied by the aspects contained in the text and which must be assembled in the course of reading. Significance is the reader's absorp- tion of the meaning into his own existence. Only the two together can guarantee the effectiveness of an experience which entails the reader constituting himself by constituting a reality hitherto unfamiliar to himself."44 This distinction points to the reader's need to interpret (to comprehend significance in) the mean- ing (the assemblage of blanks and negations into a gestalt) which he experiences while reading. Or as Rudolf E. Kuenzli summarizes Iser's intention: "Significance then is the reader's interpretation of his aesthetic experience; he explains the meaning by relating it to familiar codes." 45 Nevertheless, in conventional use "meaning" and "significance" do not seem to fall into such different streams, however much Iser tries to part the waters; and as Kuenzli notes, since publishing The Act of Reading Iser has changed his terminology in order to clarify his point: semantic interpretation ("significance" or concretely verbalized meaning) as distinct from imaginative reception (the experience of the text or ideated "meaning" in the sense of perceiving an aesthetic gestalt). In this clearer light, both "meaning" and "significance" as conventional terms address the semantic interpretation of the text. Interpretation 42 Stanley E.

"Meaning as such," Iser now points out, "is not the ultimate dimension of the literary text, but of literary theory, whose discourse is aimed at making the text translatable into terms of understanding." The reader's act of interpretation strains "to assemble meaning," to coordinate "what is represented and what the representation stands for," in order to heal the unavoidable split between the two by understanding represen- tation as semantic content. The reader's act of reception, on the other hand, "is a process of experiencing the imaginative gestalt brought forth by the text." 46 Reception, in other words, leads to the imaginative production of virtual percep- tion, that phenomenological irrealization of the reader's to produce an ideation- the construction of both virtual existence and virtual meaning-of what the text represents verbally---and incompletely-in its own language: "The aesthetic object is produced in the recipient's mind as a correlate of the text, and as such it is open to inspection by acts of comprehension; hence the business of interpreta- tion, which translates the aesthetic object into a concrete meaning." 47 I want to emphasize Iser's point of contrast between "interpretation" and "reception," because it articulates in critical terminology the distinction I referred to earlier between our sense of character as the representational subject the text means it to be (our interpretation of what the figure represents as a subject) and our sense of what it appears as virtually (our reception, our absorp- tion of the figure as subject-as-object into our own imaginative fields). Character, then, is very much what Bersani says it is, though for different reasons and with different implications: the figure is "a piece of a person" masquerading as "the appearance of completeness" only in that the text stimulates in our imaginations certain impressions of the human figure and persuades us, through its unavoid- able indeterminacy, to imagine some kind of coherent package, a gestalt, for these impressions, so that we can, in esssence, complete the text by following its coded instructions to construct the virtual existence of the figure; and in doing that, we can experience its fragmentation as a representation, or its stability, or even both. Consequently, as Kincaid suggests, we do seek implications of coherence while reading the text; but to admit this is not to agree with Bersani that the direction to organize the represented experience into a coherent imaginative gestalt necessarily translates back into a confirmation either of semantic or psychological intelligibility. In this regard, semantic coherence, achieved through the act of interpretation, requires some kind of violation of the text's inherent richness as a tension between rupture and containment, harmony and discord, whereas imaginative coherence, achieved through the act of reading, allows us to experience both possibilities concurrently. To ask whether we understand the self in Mrs. Dalloway as either object or subject so as to decide, once and for 46 Iser, "Current Situation," pp. 17-19. 47 Iser, "Current Situation," p. 19. 23</page><page sequence="20">NOVEL FALL 1983 all, whether or not there is a self in Woolf's fictive world, this question, like the concern with a coherent psychological discourse in general, demands an answer only to stabilize an interpretative choice as an argument about the narrative's content, thereby translating "the aesthetic object into a concrete meaning." The text itself is actually built out of a potential for semantic incoherence, which can lead to interpretative difference, but which above all else engages the reader in the construction of the work as an imaginative coherence. This activity involves the reader in both imaginative and interpretative acts. The potential breach between these two activities is very much the concern of fiction when its discourse openly frustrates our effort to read character as an intelligible psychological representation. In The French Lieutenant's Woman, for example, the text's discourse does not assent to our construction of Sarah Woodruff as a virtual existent in the manner by which Woolf's discourse seems to encourage our reading of Clarissa's figure as subject and object. Indeed, in contrast to Woolf's, Fowles's novel seems to be an active demonstration of Kincaid's claim that texts present their readers with structures of mutually competing coher- ences. When we turn to Sarah in particular, all our attempts to read her figure as subject-as-object seem to short-circuit if we are not to violate the text's overt declaration of indeterminacy. Sarah's figure ends up seeming as blank a page as Lady Dedlock's, but whereas Dickens's text appears willing to aid our reception by dwelling upon the figure as object and blanking it out as subject, Fowles's text continually negates and reverses the figure as both object and subject. Sarah's grounding in indeterminacy therefore appears in a text that seems openly hostile to our receiving her figure at all. We are consistently made to see her in two com- peting lights, neither one clearly focused, neither one complementing the other, as they do in Mrs. Dalloway. At times Sarah emerges in the text as a representation, a figural subject with motives for her behavior and thus a psychological content to which we as readers have access; but at other times she stands out as the text's own invention, a figural object which the narrator manipulates at will in his chess game with the reader. The indeterminacy of Sarah's figure is thus established by the lack of coordination between subject and object in the discourse: the figure is either one or the other at any given moment in the narration, often in a single paragraph. Any attempt to conjoin her figure as both subject and object only seems to instigate more gaps and ruptures, serving to place all responsibility for understanding her behavior (or her moves as a chess piece, queen to our unknowing pawn) onto our shoulders. Sarah's figure seems unreadable, then, because the text's discourse claims to be representational when at the same time it sends us a competing signal to cancel its earlier instruction to centralize her character as a psychological representation. The narrator explains that Sarah "was intelligent . . . [able] to classify other people's worth: to understand them, in the fullest sense of the word." 48 Likewise, he informs us about her behavior as the French Lieutenant's Woman, that "she was far less mad than she seemed.... Her exhibitions of her shame had a kind of purpose" (pp. 56-57). (And Sarah later confirms this 48 John Fowles, The French Lieutenant's Woman (New York: New American Library, 1970), p. 47. Further page references will be included in my text. 24</page><page sequence="21">STEVEN COHANIREADABLE CHARACTER reading when she explains to Charles her motive for making her history public.) Yet all the while he encourages his reader to pursue this line of reception, to understand Sarah as a credible subject, the narrator simultaneously repels such an effort. "Who is Sarah?" he asks. "I do not know. This story I am telling is all my imagination. These characters I create never existed outside my own mind. ... Modern women like Sarah exist, and I have never understood them" (p. 80). The narrator ends up contradicting himself. After denying any referent for Sarah's figure other than his own imagination (and yet supplying one, too- "modern women"-at the same time), he claims to be unable to penetrate her figure as a subject, whereas previously he has done so. All he can do as her narrator, he explains, is "report" (p. 81), that is, present her as a figural object. But even then he proceeds, not to report, but to penetrate her once again as a figural subject. Why does she emerge from the woods to expose herself? "The reason was simple. She had overslept, and she knew she was late .... Also, Charles' down-staring face had shocked her" (p. 83). To make matters even more confusing, in the light of later revelations everything the narrator has so far explained or reported about Sarah seems suspect, since we cannot help inferring from each sudden twist of the plot that her role-playing has always been working to entrap Charles, for whatever reasons she has in mind, and the narration suggests several. Our minds cannot help spinning in the face of such negation and contradiction, as we realize that the text seems unwilling to help us when it comes to interpreting her figure as either a psychological representation or an authorial tool. Nonetheless, our imaginations go to work all the more, since the indeterminacy of the narration only draws us closer to her figure, inviting us- daring us-to imagine her existence as a virtual figure. Because Sarah's indeterminate figure does seem to frustrate our efforts at both interpretation and reception, it actually stimulates our readerly engage- ment to make us appreciate how the text does work to center, not our inter- pretation, but our reception of her figure. The difficulty we face in reading Sarah arises only if we assume that interpretation and reception, representa- tion and imagination, work together here, as they do in Bleak House or Mrs. Dalloway. This is the readerly expectation that Fowles's text evokes through its many allusions to traditional fiction and then cancels out to seem hostile to our efforts at reception. Part of what we must experience as readers in order to construct Sarah's virtual existence is her very lack of focus as an instrument of representation and, hence, of interpretation. As a result, even though the narrator's discourse retreats as much as it advances every time he tries to get a fix on Sarah, the text does signal an instruction for our construction of her figure as a virtual existent. The narrator himself, remember, says that "Modern women like Sarah exist, and I have never understood them." Her essential mystery, her inability to be understood, undermines her as a representation with a stable psychological content, but it also provides the clue to her identity as a virtual existent. For by the same token, the narrator's confession that he can indeed imagine her and create her without understanding her suggests that we can well do the same, though we must construct her on her own terms: "I am not to be understood even by 25</page><page sequence="22">NOVELJFALL 1983 myself" (p. 354). We can therefore find a point of centrality for Sarah's figure that can accommodate the text's indeterminacy without having to make it a determinate content. That is, the more opaque Sarah becomes in the text as an unreadable psychological content, the more determinate her figure becomes in our imagina- tive fields so long as we construct her virtual existence according to the dimensions of mystery she herself continually establishes by virtue of her indeterminacy as a subject. These dimensions do set her apart from the narra- tive ground because her figure deflects penetration by that ground. Through her opacity Sarah emerges in our minds as a figural object which we try to imagine as a figural subject, first by pursuing her motives, perhaps, but ulti- mately by reversing the procedure I outlined in Mrs. Dalloway to construct her figure as object-as-subject. By concentrating on her inherent opacity as an object we confront and absorb her inescapable mystery as a subject. When Sarah smiles at Charles, for instance, we get a clue for such figural construction from the text. To Charles her smile becomes a "revelation of her humor, that her sadness was not total. And in those wide eyes, so somber, sad and direct, was revealed an irony, a new dimension of herself" (p. 150). This new dimension, I want to stress, is non-verbal, even in the features being described; it emerges from a facial gesture, so it resists semantic translation, although Charles himself tries to interpret it. By understanding her humor as an alternative to her sadness, he wants to coordinate this new view of her to his previous view, but he does so in terms of her local history, The French Lieutenant's Woman, for that is the only way he knows how to read her. The narration denies for us that type of reading, since it makes her history too indeterminate to understand unless we engage in an act of interpretation our- selves, which requires us to select one pattern of coherence from the many that compete for our attention. By so frustrating our initial attempts to construct Sarah as a representation of an intelligible personality, the text actually highlights for us the importance of her ironic look, which is a mode of expression, particularly in the specific instance I just cited, that works by indirection, by meaning what it cannot say to remain beyond our ken semantically. Sarah is, finally, unintelligible in that her figural content is imaginative, not semantic, so it always seems able to repel any attempt to understand it fully through the discourse of representation and interpretation, the conventional mode of narration. But if we receive her imaginatively as a figure who is not to be understood in the conventional manner by which novelistic characters are assumed to be understood, then she does project a virtual existence. As we construct her figure, she then begins to centralize for our readerly space the mystery and tension that the narration itself articulates through its indeterminate discourse about her. Whether viewed as Victorian woman, modern woman, or the text's invention, Sarah's figure works upon us to imagine, and consequently to experience in our own space, the energy of desire (fiction) subverting the restraints of culture (determinate form). This imaginative content the discourse can only render incompletely through its language; and the text's own indeterminacy embodies the inability of discourse 26</page><page sequence="23">STEVEN COHANIREADABLE CHARACTER to achieve its end, semantic content, without first domesticating its imaginative content through an act of interpretation. With Sarah we come back full circle to the Widow Wadman and Tristram's two blank pages. Like Sterne's novel, The French Lieutenant's Woman orches- trates the negations and blanks in its discourse to increase our self-consciousness of the reading act itself. The textual discourse explaining the representational figure is no more than an unactualized field of imaginative existence for that figure. What the text actually does is to present its reader with discourse, relying on him to use it to construct the figure as a virtual existent with an imaginary content. So when we read we do need some encoded direction, how- ever enigmatic, some encouragement, however devious, from the text to learn how it informs its discourse with the potential for stimulating in our imaginations a perception of the figure as distinct from its narrative ground. Fowles's text works through its competing instructions about Sarah's character as a repre- sentation to make us aware of our very need to centralize what we receive from a text through both interpretative and imaginative acts; and, like Tristram's two blank pages, it intensifies our realization that such activities take place in our space alone, not in the text's, even though more straight-forward, representational novels may claim otherwise when they work to superimpose their own textual space onto their readers's imaginative space. Character is readable, Sarah being no exception, when it helps stimulate our construction of that imaginative space in our minds as we read. Character, after all, only creates the illusion of being a reference to the real world. In truth, the figure is an imaginative construction, a virtual existent that leads us beyond a concern with psychological intelligibility, with the figure's semantic content. Our construction of the figure, like the text's encoded directions, may build out of referential material, just as it builds out of discourse; but it always pushes us beyond the text into an imaginative space located in our own heads. The act of interpretation effects to bridge our way back into the text, or even outward to the real world, in order to account for our reception, to explain its import, and, most of all, to communicate to other readers what we have experienced while reading. While we should not minimize this activity, we should also put it into perspective, for it necessarily conceives of character's readability in the light of semantic coherence. Our reception of the figure may encourage that semantic translation, it may not. In any event, the act of reading itself, if understood as an imaginative rather than an interpretative activity, does not require, finally, that we coordinate what we receive to what the text represents in order to achieve a coherent semantic content. In fact, as Iser explains, any text must produce some semantic rupture, some discordance, for it to be received imaginatively. This is particularly important when it comes to reading character. Our construction depends, not on psychological delineation as the primary impetus, but on our absorbing the figure into that space beyond the text, where it can be transformed from a series of linguistic signals and semantic referents into a virtual existent. This capacity for transformation is what draws us towards novels, and makes us focus our attention on their characters, in the first place. 27</page></plain_text>
