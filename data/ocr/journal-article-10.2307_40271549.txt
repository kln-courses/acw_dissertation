KINGSLAND Department of History of Science and Technology Johns Hopkins University Baltimore, MD 21218 USA E-mail: Sharon@jhu.edu Abstract. In Landscapes and Labscapes Robert Köhler emphasized the separation between laboratory and field cultures and the creation of new "hybrid" or mixed practices as field sciences matured in the early twentieth century. This article explores related changes in laboratory practices, especially novel designs for the analysis of organism-environment relations in the mid-twentieth century. American ecologist Victor Shelford argued in 1929 that technological improvements and indoor climate control should be applied to ecological laboratories, but his recommendations were too ambitious for the time. In the postwar period Frits W. Went, plant physiologist at the California Institute of Technology, created a new high-tech laboratory, dubbed a "phytotron", in the hope that it would transform plant sciences by allowing for unprecedented control of environmental variables. Went's aspirations, the research conducted in his laboratory, and its impact in initiating an international movement, are considered. Went's laboratory can be seen as a "hybrid culture" evolving in the laboratory, complementing and intersecting with some of the field practices that Köhler describes. It was also a countercultural movement against the reductionist trends of molecular biology in the 1950s and 1960s. By considering the history of the laboratory in relation to field sciences, we can explore how new funding sources and cross-disciplinary relations affected the development of field sciences, especially in the postwar period.

These are generally described as conflicts between "experimentalists" and</page><page sequence="2">290 SHARON E. KINGSLAND "naturalists" or between laboratory and field scientists. Robert Köhler, building on this literature, redirected this discussion along new lines in his book of 2002, Landscapes and Labscapes. Inspired by the literature in historical geography, he analyzed these conflicts by developing a metaphorical "cultural geography" of scientific borderlands, in this case the border region imagined as lying in between the laboratory and the field.1 Biological struggles for authority, he suggested, were roughly comparable to cultural clashes in frontier environments, which set in motion changes that produced new hybrid cultures in these border re- gions. A central historical question has been how practices that combine observation and experiments in such "borderland regions" of science have evolved over time, and how the dynamic interaction of laboratory and field cultures has shaped field sciences. In Landscapes and Labscapes Kohler invited us to explore the evolving methods of field research and the changing career paths of field scientists in the first half of the twentieth century. With the rise of the modern laboratory in the late-nineteenth century, he argued, a new borderland was created, the lab-field border, and he explored how sci- entists adapted to this border region in fields such as ecology, evolu- tionary biology and experimental taxonomy. He reminded us that the laboratory and the field represented different "cultures," or ways of approaching scientific work, and that the products of laboratory work were often seen as superior to field study, because they were judged to be more rigorous and universally valid, rather than being tied to obser- vations made in particular places. The main problem he addressed was how field scientists gained confidence and authority, given this disparity in cultural values. He envisioned the field-lab borderland as an "intangible cultural space" that at first was an idea or an imagined place but became a real place, a place where "border culture" was "experienced and lived."2 He studied scientists working within the border regions that connected the laboratory and the field and assessed how well they met the challenge of combining elements of each culture in their efforts to further the sciences of ecology and evolutionary biology. At first their efforts to create a hybrid culture were unsuccessful, but by the 1940s Köhler detected clear evidence of successful adaptation in this dynamic "borderland" region of science. He emphasized the evolutionary process occurring in the field, that is, the way field scientists made their science more rigorous (and in this respect more "lablike") but without adopting the methods 1 Köhler, 2002. 2 Ibid., pp. 5-6.</page><page sequence="3">FRITS WENT'S ATOMIC AGE GREENHOUSE 29 1 of the laboratory in a strict sense, or the material culture of the labo- ratory. Field scientists, he argued, had to learn to free themselves from strict adherence to the ideals of laboratory culture before they could create a new hybrid culture appropriate to field science. He saw inno- vation arising in the field as field biologists became more sophisticated, more self-confident, and less enslaved by laboratory culture in their approach to science. The overall story is one of emancipation of field science from laboratory culture. He adopted this approach intentionally in order to avoid a "lab-centered" view of the history of biology and in order to give field science balanced treatment. However, he also referred in passing to the coevolution of laboratory and field, while admitting that its history was not yet written, in part because the history of the "laboratory movement" of the nineteenth century was unwritten.3 He did draw attention to the creation of new kinds of laboratory spaces, such as marine stations, biological farms, vivaria and field laboratories, which were more suited to field sciences because they reconnected the scientist with the world of nature.4 Viewing the sometimes faltering early attempts to create these experi- mental facilities, one might conclude that the initial vision was seriously flawed, but I would like to emphasize how difficult it was in those early years both to obtain resources and to overcome problems of laboratory design. Reinventing the laboratory was a demanding and costly undertaking, which depended in part on the level of technology avail- able at any given time. While some, such as Illinois animal ecologist Victor Ernest Shelford, perceived the need for this kind of reinvention at an early stage in the development of ecology, bringing it about was a daunting task. It was not until after the Second World War that a relatively suc- cessful, albeit controversial, example of such a reinvented laboratory was built. I will expand the story started by Köhler into the postwar period by focusing on one laboratory in particular: the Earhart Plant Research Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology (Cal- tech). This laboratory opened in 1949 under the direction of plant physiologist Frits Warmolt Went. Known colloquially as a "phytotron" because of its superficial resemblance to a cyclotron, it was intended to be a state-of-the-art laboratory, not for reductionist biology but spe- cifically for the study of whole organisms and for problems that were of direct relevance to field sciences and to agriculture. 3 Ibid., p. 3. 4 Ibid., pp. 41-55.</page><page sequence="4">292 SHARON E. KINGSLAND I view this facility as the laboratory equivalent to the ''hybrid cul- ture" that Köhler described as emerging in the field. However, this laboratory hybrid was created a little after the time period that Köhler examined, which ended around 1950. 1 will explore the motives driving the reinvention of the laboratory, some of the scientific problems studied in this new environment, and the impact that it had on the postwar scientific landscape. The Earhart Laboratory became a model for similar laboratories constructed around the world and could be considered to have spawned a true "laboratory movement." The history of field science, in short, is not a story of the creation of one form of hybrid culture, but of two, which coexisted in an uncertain relationship. By examining the "lab-field border" from the laboratory side, we also have a means of extending Kohler's narrative about the maturation of field sciences into the postwar period. Köhler admitted that the postwar trajectory of his story was hard to discern. He ended his book with a short survey of "border biology" after the war, but his examples emphasized field practice and did not consider what might be occurring in the history of the laboratory. One way to connect the prewar and postwar cultures is to put the history of the laboratory back into the narrative and investigate how innovation in laboratory designs con- tributed to the development of field sciences. An important change in the postwar period was the emergence of funding sources, both private and public, for construction and operation of new kinds of laboratories that used state-of-the-art technologies for climate control. Putting the laboratory into the narrative serves another useful function because the laboratory was a multi-disciplinary environment where both basic and practical problems were studied. Ecological studies were pursued in the Earhart laboratory, alongside work in plant physiology, evolutionary biology, and work on applied problems relating to agriculture and forestry. We already know from historical research that the growth of postwar ecology, especially systems ecology, reflected practical problems emerging in the postwar period, such as concern about radiation in the environment, and that national labora- tories such as the Oak Ridge National Laboratory were growth centers for ecology.5 Physiological ecology likewise benefited from interest in solving practical problems, such as improving agricultural productivity, reducing damage to plants from smog, and restoring degraded grass- lands. The Earhart Laboratory, being well suited for the study of practical problems, could attract funding by being open to such prac- tical investigations. Examining these places, one can get a better 5 Booking, 1997; Kwa, 1993.</page><page sequence="5">FRITS WENT'S ATOMIC AGE GREENHOUSE 293 appreciation of the extent to which horticultural and agricultural problems underlie the development of basic botanical sciences, includ- ing the development of ecology. The Need for Laboratory Innovation Before introducing the Earhart Laboratory at Caltech I briefly consider some of the obstacles to the pursuit of experimental ecology in the early twentieth century, using one of Köhler' s key examples: Victor Shelford, a leading animal ecologist and first president of the Ecological Society of America. Ecology was defined as a subject in the late-nineteenth century and developed disciplinary coherence during the first two dec- ades of the twentieth century. It was considered to be both an obser- vational and an experimental science that drew upon natural history, morphology, and physiology. Andreas Schimper, a German botanist who wrote a seminal treatise in ecology, Plant Geography upon a Physiological Basis (1898, with an English translation in 1903), defined ecological plant geography as a science that "leans closely on experi- mental physiology" and investigates problems of plant distribution and adaptive change.6 Using (experimental methods, he argued, it was pos- sible to "sever the study of adaptations from dilettantism" and "free it from anthropomorphic trifling, which has threatened to bring it into complete discredit." As ecology developed, the continuing relationship between ecology and physiology was explicitly acknowledged by the custom of dividing ecology into two branches. "Autecology" (or auto-ecology) referred to the study of single species and problems of organism-environment relations. "Synecology" referred to the study of groups or communities of species and how the composition of communities changed over time. Synecology depended on autecology: to understand the dynamic rela- tions underlying community structure and development, it was neces- sary to have basic knowledge about how organisms responded to their environments. This knowledge in turn required basic physiological understanding, so that autecology was in practice synonymous with "physiological ecology" or "ecological physiology." Although ecologists believed that they should take their experiments into the field and derive their theories and principles after immersing themselves in the field environment, they also gave thought to the need to improve laboratory designs and practices. Essential as it was to work in 6 Schimper, 1903, p. vi.</page><page sequence="6">294 SHARON E. KINGSLAND the field, field conditions could never be completely controlled and interpretations of results were open to challenge. The more controlled environment of the laboratory could offer important support to field studies. Shelford, one of the first generation of American animal ecolo- gists, was an example of someone who devoted considerable attention to the laboratory environment, as well as to field research. As Köhler de- scribes, Shelford moved from field to laboratory ecology in 1913, devel- oping the vivarium at the University of Illinois into a physiological laboratory devoted to zoological problems. Here he worked for 15 years, until in 1928 he left the vivarium and went back to field research. For Köhler, this abrupt shift from field to lab and then back to field was an indication of Shelford's failure to understand that trying to apply laboratory ideals to ecology was inappropriate and was doomed from the outset. Shelford represented a failed idealist who had assumed a "communality of interest among physiologists and ecologists that did not exist" because "physiologists of the field and of the lab worked on different problems to different ends."7 Quoting Shelford in 1933, Köhler emphasized his heartfelt recognition that ecologists had placed far too much faith in carefully controlled experiments. Shelford was an example of someone who had tried too hard to import laboratory culture into ecology and had "deferred too readily to the superior standing of experiment."8 His career path, punctuated by "abrupt flights from field to lab and back," was taken to be an indicator of a failed vision of ecology.9 I agree with Kohler's assessment that Shelford did not realize his ideal because "he was never able to devise a method of experiment that met laboratory standards and was appropriate to field problems."10 However, rather than viewing Shelford as someone struggling for 15 years with a failed vision caused by his reluctance to wean himself from laboratory ideals, I would like to explore an alternative idea, which was that he was a visionary ahead of his time. I would argue that Shelford did perceive the difference between traditional laboratory physiology and ecology, but at the same time also knew that ecological work depended on physiological knowledge. What he wanted to create was an ecological laboratory that was appropriate for ecological problems. In the 1920s he could imagine what that laboratory might contain, but he could not build it. 7 Köhler, 2002, p. 160. 8 Ibid., p. 162. 9 Ibid., p. 163. 10 Ibid.</page><page sequence="7">FRITS WENTS ATOMIC AGE GREENHOUSE 295 To grasp Shelford's dilemma we should consider the arguments he made in his text of 1929, Laboratory and Field Ecology, which sum- marized his years of laboratory research. To some extent the book seems to expose Shelford's failure as an experimentalist, but in other respects it is a remarkable book for its reflections on the importance of laboratory infrastructure and what might be learned from past failures. Somewhat oddly, Shelford rejected the term "autecology" as being unnecessary, insisting that ecology was the science of communities.11 What he seemed to be underscoring was the idea that ecology was not limited to or reducible to autecology and that ecologists always had to relate their studies to entire communities of organisms. But he did not mean that ecology no longer included the subject matter of traditional autecology, for his book was largely devoted to problems that would have fallen into the category of autecology. These included general problems of how animals responded to climatic conditions such as temperature, light and moisture, and how soil conditions affected plant and animal growth. His discussion of how animals and plants re- sponded to external conditions led to a detailed analysis of what kinds of facilities were needed to simulate different climate conditions indoors. Thus the book, although marking the close of Shelford's stint as a laboratory ecologist, was an appeal for a new approach to laboratory science and for a new kind of laboratory that would be suited to eco- logical investigations. Shelford's discussion, especially in a key chapter dealing with buildings and equipment for climate simulation, revealed how compli- cated the design of an ecological laboratory could be and how crucial it was to approach such design problems with care and foresight.12 The maintenance of "constant conditions" was not the objective of the ecological laboratory, for organisms did not thrive in constant envi- ronments. Rather, controlled variation of environmental conditions was the goal. Shelford emphasized the importance of bringing design and innovation to the laboratory. For instance, he pointed out that it was necessary to abandon the notion that a laboratory greenhouse was anything like a commercial greenhouse: such buildings had to be de- signed from scratch and properly sited so that they met the requirements of experiments. Laboratory directors had to develop collaborative relationships with engineers and make sure that engineers understood that "the organism dictates the character of the equipment."13 As he 11 Shelford, 1929, p. 2; Croker, 1991. 12 Shelford, 1929, pp. 383-425. 13 Ibid., p. 392.</page><page sequence="8">296 SHARON E. KINGSLAND stressed, climate simulation work was not simple and the apparatus used could not be simple.14 Improved laboratory design could not occur before certain techno- logical innovations, such as lighting, air-conditioning, and means of modifying and monitoring environmental conditions, were available. In the 1920s, when Shelford was writing his book, such technologies were relatively new but were developing in a way that seemed promising for laboratory research. For example, a state-of-the-art botanical labora- tory, which Shelford cited for its use of innovative experimental designs, had just opened in 1924 in Yonkers, New York, the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research. The brainchild of William Boyce Thompson, mining magnate and one of the richest men in America, this institute was intended to advance botanical research in relation to agricultural problems, on the model of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. Thompson's sudden zeal for scientific philanthropy was a result of his experience during the First World War while on a Red Cross relief mission sent to Russia in 1917. Witnessing the Bol- shevik Revolution, he was deeply impressed by the connection between food supply and social stability, which he translated into the idea of creating a research institute dedicated to improving agricultural effi- ciency. He poured millions of dollars into his research institute until his death in 1930.15 Much of the climate-control equipment used at the Boyce Thompson Institute was new and untested in laboratory environments. In the 1910s air-conditioning was starting to be used in factories, especially in textile mills and food manufacturing, and by the 1920s motion picture theaters were a growing market for air-conditioning.16 Engineers in the heating and ventilation field were developing expertise designing different sys- tems for various places and functions, and in 1919 the American Society of Heating and Ventilation Engineers established their own research laboratory at the U.S. Bureau of Mines in Pittsburgh. When Thompson decided to establish a plant research institute in 1919, the technology and expertise were just becoming available to allow him to create a facility with an unprecedented level of control over the environment.17 In fact Thompson's vision for his laboratory and greenhouse complex ran ahead of the engineering capabilities of the day. Its director, bota- nist William Crocker, anticipated that future discoveries in plant science 14 Ibid. 15 Hagedorn, 1935. 16 Cooper, 1998. 17 Anonymous, 1925.</page><page sequence="9">FRITS WENT'S ATOMIC AGE GREENHOUSE 297 as well as improved mechanical engineering would necessitate continual refinements of design, as well as expansion of the facility.18 When it opened in 1924 it was meant to be a work in progress, where only a portion of the controls that they expected eventually to use had yet been installed. Figuring out how to use and run such a facility was very challenging. When Frits Went visited the Institute in 1946, he was disappointed that the funds available did not seem to be used to full advantage.19 He believed that little forethought had gone into the selection of investiga- tors, research problems, and even planning of the physical equipment. "A lot of expensive equipment and extensive laboratories are present," he noted, "but they have in no way been integrated. Most of the special equipment was not in use, and seemed rather a drag than an asset.... Most of the air-conditioning equipment originally installed in all their greenhouses has been removed on account of inefficient engineering."20 To his dismay he concluded that the Institute was operating too much like a horticultural experiment station, with inadequate emphasis on basic science and too much attention to immediate practical problems. Throwing money at problems allowed for some experimentation in designing equipment for climate-control, but did not necessarily produce successful integration of institutional design and research questions. Seeing how difficult it was to operate a complex research facility even in the 1940s, we can appreciate the enormous gap between Shelford's visions for laboratory life and what was realistic for the 1920s. What he laid out in 1929 was an indication of what a laboratory and greenhouse complex could be, and what kinds of climate control machinery and apparatus it might include, rather than what actually existed at that time. Describing his own work at the University of Illinois, he was at pains to point out not just what facilities he had at his disposal for experimental work, but exactly what deficiencies hampered experimental work and what technologies had to be abandoned or modified to get better results. Shelford also complained of lack of funding for climatic and eco- logical research. Privately funded operations like the Boyce Thompson Institute could hardly be emulated elsewhere, and even that Institute required external funds to supplement its endowment following Thompson's death. Shelford thought that such facilities could only be supported through public funds, but that it would take an important economic problem to motivate such expenditure and that research 18 Crocker, 1925, p. 32. 19 A description of the Institute's research for the first two decades is in Crocker, 1948. 20 Went, 1946.</page><page sequence="10">298 SHARON E. KINGSLAND interest would likely wane after 3 years if the work could not be brought to a close within that time period.21 His scenario of a high-tech labo- ratory-based ecological research program, while on the one hand ambitious and optimistic about success if facilities could be created, seemed at the same time to despair that the obstacles to this vision could truly be overcome, due to lack of resources. As Charles Kofoid re- marked in his review of Shelford's book, "This is truly an imposing program. The author's estimate that 'a small plant' for this purpose could be built for $300,000 is another way of expressing this conclu- sion."22 Another reviewer concluded that given the "elaborate and expensive apparatus" that Shelford deemed necessary for ecological work "it does not seem likely that his program will be followed up by very many experimental workers."23 (As this reviewer pointed out, a Carrier air-conditioning cabinet alone cost $2,000 in 1930.) Shelford's ambitions for ecology, if unrealizable at that time, were not rejected as inappropriate in principle, however. Charles Elton pointed out that Shelford's book showed that the "progress of animal ecology has greatly depended upon the parallel development of physics and chemistry, and of technical inventions, without which it is impos- sible to make quantitative analysis of animal environments."24 He continued, "Prof. Shelford has a vision of animal ecology as an exact quantitative science, and if the results of this type of ecological work are still in an early stage, and remain uncoordinated, no one can doubt their importance in the future."25 Nor did Shelford himself abandon this vision, despite the discouragement that Köhler noted in 1933. In the early 1950s Shelford, now emeritus professor at Illinois, still lamented the imperfect conditions that he had worked under 35 years earlier. In 1953 he complained that "about 5,000 teachers, investigators, and especially postgraduate students in the United States in the fields of plant ecology and taxonomy, wildlife, ornithology, animal ecology and ichthyology are deprived of opportunities to do experimental work because of obsolete campus and building plans."26 Ever hopeful, he proposed new plans for an improved biological research plant. Shelford's continuing interest in laboratory development can be better understood just by considering a subset of his research proposals, 21 Shelford, 1929, pp. 424^125. 22 Kofoid, 1930, p. 610. 23 Cook, 1930, p. 614. 24 Elton, 1931, p. 216. 25 Ibid., p. 217. 26 Shelford, 1953, p. 425.</page><page sequence="11">FRITS WENTS ATOMIC AGE GREENHOUSE 299 those connecting ecology to physiology. Lack of facilities could affect how quickly physiological discoveries were used to expand the scope of ecology. For example in 1920 two agricultural scientists, Wightman Wells Garner and his assistant Harry Ardell Allard, published a dis- covery that was considered to be of far-reaching significance in physi- ology, ecology, and agricultural science.27 They had discovered in 1918 that certain plants appeared to be able to measure the length of the day, and that in those species key stages of plant development, such as flowering, were determined by day-length. After 2 years of painstaking experiments they concluded that plants fell into four basic types: short- day plants, long-day plants, plants intermediate between these groups, and indeterminate plants that seemed indifferent to length of day. Garner called the response of plants to day-length "photoperiodism" and the discovery was immediately recognized as important.28 Soon scientists found that other characteristics of plants, beyond flowering and fruiting, were apparently affected by the length of day.29 Barrington Moore, president of the Ecological Society of America, published a favorable review in 1920 in Ecology, encouraging ecologists to examine this effect in the plants they studied in the field.30 Shelford noted in 1929 that the physiological effect of light was a promising field for investigation and that photoperiodism appeared to be important as a stimulus for sexual reproduction in animals as well as plants.31 Allard himself published an ecological study of photoperiodism in 1932, arguing that understanding the length-of-day requirements of plants allowed for a clearer interpretation of their behavior and natural dis- tribution.32 But the response by ecologists to this discovery was rela- tively slow. As late as 1953 we find Shelford complaining that the effect of photoperiodism on wild plants was barely touched, and that the entire field "which is so important to the solution of the problems of the ecologist, geographer and palaeontologist remains largely to be explored."33 In part, he implied, this meager response reflected the lack of facilities for experimental analysis. 27 Garner and Allard, 1920. 28 Garner and Allard, 1922. The term "photoperiodism" was suggested by O. F. Cook of the Bureau of Plant Industry. 29 Kellerman, 1926, p. 90.

KINGSLAND The Laboratory as a Cultural Borderland By the time that Shelford uttered these complaints in the 1950s, an innovative experiment in laboratory design was already underway in botanical science, namely the Earhart Plant Research Laboratory at Caltech. It was not apparently derived from Shelford's ideas, but had independent origins in botany and horticulture. Its director, Frits Went, aspired to bring field science and laboratory science into closer rela- tionship. Unlike Shelford, Went was able to mobilize the resources needed to translate his dream into a new state-of-the-art laboratory facility. Went's ambition was to build a completely new kind of labo- ratory, where "all possible climatic factors, such as light, temperature, humidity, gas content of the air, wind, rain, or fog" were "simulta- neously and independently controllable."34 Such a laboratory would contribute to agricultural and related practical problems, to be sure, but it would also do basic research and fulfill the academic mission of the research university where it was located. While other biologists at Caltech were turning toward biochemistry and genetics, Went embraced what he fervently believed was an important but neglected subject, the environment and its impact on organisms. Soon after opening in 1949 the Earhart laboratory was dubbed the "phytotron" because its complex control panel resembled the control room of a cyclotron (Figure I).35 Went at first did not like the neolo- gism but soon embraced it, appreciating its power in signaling some- thing modern and conjuring up the authority and mystique of physics. The Caltech phytotron became a model for other facilities in the U.S. and around the world: all were known as "phytotrons" no matter where they were located. Unlike the earlier Boyce Thompson Institute, it successfully generated a new laboratory movement from the 1950s through the 1970s. This emerging movement at the "lab-field border- land" constituted a hybrid culture evolving within the laboratory, one that complemented the hybrid culture that Köhler has described evolving in the field. Went was unusually qualified by his upbringing and career to serve as a cross-cultural ambassador. If we imagine that the scientific cultures of field and laboratory meet in "frontier" landscapes, we should realize that these frontiers are not necessarily remote wilderness locations, but also include botanical gardens, which geographically could be either 34 Went, 1957a, p. 93.

His father, Friedrich August Ferdinand Christian Went, was a plant physiologist and director of the botanical garden at the University of Utrecht, which also had a modern, well- equipped laboratory. The Went family lived next to the botanical gar- den, so Frits was constantly exposed to laboratory life as well as to the garden environment, its greenhouses, and the exotic plants arriving from the famed Royal Botanical Gardens at Buitenzorg (now Bogor) on the island of Java.36 Exotic plants such as orchids were grown in greenhouses at Utrecht to find out if they would behave as they did in Indonesia. From an early age Went was exposed to the general problem of organism-environment relations and what happens when plants are moved from their native habitats. 36 Went, 1990.</page><page sequence="14">302 SHARON E. KINGSLAND When Went decided to become a botanist, his doctoral work in physiology on the subject of plant hormones was done under his father's direction at Utrecht. Went devised a way to measure the presence of a plant growth hormone, later called auxin, and showed that it was nec- essary for certain types of plant growth. His thesis on the subject, pub- lished in 1928, was considered important for proving the existence of plant hormones and is now regarded as a classic study in plant physi- ology.37 After the doctorate it was normal for Dutch botanists to go to the colonies to establish their careers. Went worked in Java from 1927 until 1933, when he accepted a faculty position in plant physiology at Caltech. His experience in this tropical environment turned his interests more toward ecological problems, in part from necessity. The heat and humidity prevented the use of complex equipment for physiological experiments, so he pursued simpler experiments and problems in plant ecology that could be studied through field research. The experience of the tropical environment left a deep impression on him, as it had done earlier for one of the pioneers of ecological plant geography, Andreas Schimper, who had also worked in the Dutch East Indies.38 In his eco- logical studies Went saw himself as following the lead of Schimper, who had explored problems of plant adaptation, relating ecological obser- vations to general Darwinian ideas about evolutionary processes.39 Went arrived at Caltech, then, with prior experience of the "two cultures" of laboratory and field, and of the borderland located in the colonial setting in Java. If one tried to imagine a person perfectly pre- pared to develop a new "hybrid culture" on the lab-field borderland, Went might be the ideal candidate. What is interesting for our purposes is that the new hybrid culture took shape within a redesigned laboratory setting, rather than in field-based research. Went recognized, as Shelford had, that it was important to have a place for rigorous controlled experiments, a place where the laboratory ideal of repeatability and universality could be developed and sustained. To achieve this goal in a way that was relevant to field science required a new kind of laboratory. From Orchid Culture to Phytotron While the allusion to the cyclotron conjures up a vision of Big Science in the postwar period, the immediate inspiration for Went's phytotron 37 Went, 1928b. 38 Cittadino, 1990. 39 Went and Went, 1945, p. 400.</page><page sequence="15">FRITS WENT'S ATOMIC AGE GREENHOUSE 303 predated the Second World War and had different origins: American enthusiasm for orchid culture, which was becoming a big business. Before 1900 orchid culture in the United States was confined to private estates and park conservatories, with few orchids being grown for sale. In the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century, knowledge of how to grow orchids from seed and create new hybrid forms advanced stea- dily.40 By the 1920s, with improved technologies, it became possible to propagate otherwise rare and expensive orchids in large numbers. Hy- brid orchids, with their larger size and greater vigor, became more important in the cut-flower business and orchid growing ballooned into a multi-million dollar business. In the South and West, interest in orchid culture led to experiments with air-conditioned greenhouses, since orchids require careful ventila- tion and controlled temperatures. One innovative amateur orchid grower was Henry O. Eversole, a physician and former representative of the Rockefeller Foundation for Eastern Europe, who had retired and was living near Caltech. He had approached the Carrier air-condition- ing company about air-conditioning his greenhouses but was told it was impossible, so he worked with engineers and physicists to design and build an air-conditioned greenhouse for his private orchid collection in 1933, the same year that Frits Went arrived at Caltech. Eversole then interested a local grower in building an experimental greenhouse of commercial size, hoping to develop the commercial potential of such greenhouses. Growing techniques were slightly different in air-condi- tioned spaces, however, and Eversole conducted extensive experiments to discover what environmental conditions and nutrient supplements optimized the growth of his plants.41 Eversole eventually approached Went, who was impressed not only with the mechanical innovations of the air-conditioned greenhouse but with Eversole's acumen and observational powers as he worked out what environmental conditions best suited his plants. Eversole offered to build an air-conditioned greenhouse for Went at Caltech. At the time Caltech had a small greenhouse that had been built for Went's prede- cessor, Herman Dolk, who had died in a car accident in 1932. That greenhouse lacked a gas supply, because the gas, then produced from coal, contained ethylene, which affected plant responses.42 Went accepted Eversole's offer on the condition that he build two greenhouses so that comparative experiments could be done. Eversole's sister-in-law, 40 White, 1942; Griesbach, 2003. 41 Went, 1990, pp. 26-27; White, 1942, pp. 30, 72-75. 42 Bonner, 1980, p. 17.</page><page sequence="16">304 SHARON E. KINGSLAND Lucy Mason Clark, donated the funds for construction and the Clark greenhouses opened in 1939. Although Went's prior work in botany and at Caltech had been based on studies of hormones, especially the growth hormone auxin, he had lost interest in further hormone studies by 1937 and was looking for another project. Eversole's overture was enough to steer him toward studies of organism-environment relations, a subject related not only to his earlier studies in Java but to his growing fasci- nation with the desert environment of California. The other scientists at Caltech, Went explained, were preoccupied with biochemistry and were not thinking about studying the role of the environment in plant development.43 Thus he pretty much controlled the work done in the Clark greenhouses. In 1943 Went highlighted the improved efficiency that would result from designs that enabled scientists to control temperature and humidity in laboratories. Growing plants under controlled conditions "makes experiments more reproducible and conclusions more binding," he noted, hoping that "demonstration of successful operation of these air-conditioned greenhouses should prompt many more botanical institutes to construct similar houses."44 One of the first results to come out of his work at the Clark greenhouses was the discovery of ther- moperiodicity, that is, the discovery that certain plants, such as toma- toes, needed a daily cycle of temperature change, with lower night temperatures, to grow and set fruit optimally. Eversole had actually anticipated this result in his orchid work, a discovery that Went attributed to Eversole's willingness to tinker with his thermostats and observe the results, rather than be "bound by the rigid rules of scientific experimentation."45 These designs set the stage for the construction of a more elaborate set of climate-controlled laboratories and greenhouses after the war. By this time, Went was able to benefit from two decades of research on physiological problems, such as photoperiodism, that involved the study of mature plants and their environmental responses. Physiologists investigating these subjects had had to solve various practical problems of laboratory and equipment design, and Went and Eversole toured the country in 1946 to learn from these places what worked and what did not. For instance, scientists studying photoperiodism at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Maryland, which Went and Eversole visited, used carbon-arc lights because they provided high-intensity 43 Went, 1974, p. 11. 44 Went, 1943, p. 163. 45 Went, 1974, p. 11.</page><page sequence="17">FRITS WENT'S ATOMIC AGE GREENHOUSE 305 light. But the burning carbon produced toxic fumes that had to be drawn off by a ventilation system. Lighting also produced heat, requiring refrigeration of the rooms.46 Seemingly minor differences in experimental rooms produced different results, so it was important to standardize equipment and know exactly what the environmental con- ditions were. Designing a laboratory to explore organism-environment relations meant solving various problems of climate control and taking advantage of new technologies, such as air-conditioning or the new fluorescent lighting, as they became available. Went's visit to Beltsville also prompted a collaborative experiment that led to a key improvement in laboratory design. The Beltsville team had an exceptionally high-quality spectrograph, which the scientists were using to investigate the effect of different wavelengths of light on plants. Sterling Brown Hendricks, a physical chemist and former Cal- tech student, who was then working on problems of soil nutrition at Beltsville, had designed the instrument using two large glass prisms borrowed from the Astrophysical Laboratory at the Smithsonian Institution. Hendricks's spectrograph produced a rainbow over five feet long that could be directed onto individual plants and allowed for exact measurement of the plant's response to different wavelengths of light.47 The team had found that the red end of the spectrum was particularly effective with two wavelengths, one in the red and the other closer to infrared, called "far-red", being especially important. At that time it was normal to use an orange-red "safelight" in lab- oratory darkrooms, and Went had noticed at Caltech that the seedlings growing at the front of his shelves had larger leaves than ones farther back. His preliminary experiments suggested that red light influenced leaf growth the most, while blue light was ineffective. The spectrograph allowed Went and the Beltsville team to make a more exact study of what wavelength was affecting seedling growth. Their conclusions, published in 1949, were that the same wavelength of light that caused flowering in photoperiodically sensitive plants also appeared to cause leaf growth in the pea seedlings that Went was studying.48 This result implied that such different processes as flowering and leaf growth were controlled by the same mechanism, which was quite surprising. But their team experiment also had important implications for lab- oratory design. As recalled by Arthur Galston, one of Went's colleagues at Caltech, "dark rooms all over the country had to be refurbished. 46 Parker and Borthwick, 1949. 47 Butler and Wadleigh, 1987; Hendricks, 1970. 48 Parker et al., 1949.</page><page sequence="18">306 SHARON E. KINGSLAND Before then, plants had been grown in red safelights."49 Now they had to replace their red light filters with green filters that would allow plants to grow properly. This example illustrates the way that laboratory de- signs had to be constantly adjusted as experiments were performed and new findings emerged. One could not know in advance what design was optimal - on the contrary, the design details emerged from observation and discovery. Laboratory designs for the study of growth and devel- opmental processes in plants required technological innovation, sharp observation, and skill in designing and using instruments. While the Beltsville innovations were made in a physiological context, they were focusing on organism-environment relations, suggesting that a com- parable level of innovation could benefit other fields, such as ecology, that were linked to physiology. By the late- 1940s it was possible to bring to experimental ecology, and to other field sciences, a kind of laboratory that simply could not have been built earlier because the technology and knowledge of plant physiology had not existed. A New Experimental Mini-World Buoyed by his earlier laboratory experiments and by his sense that Caltech could lead the country in botanical research, Went prodded Robert Millikan, head of the Board of Trustees and de facto president of Caltech, to approve the creation of a larger research facility. Millikan persuaded his friend Harry B. Earhart, oil baron turned philanthropist, to donate funds for the project. The selling point to Earhart was that the research would result in large improvements in agricultural efficiency the world over and therefore have enormous economic as well as bio- logical impact. As with William Boyce Thompson earlier, concern with food production in the aftermath of a world war motivated investment in plant research. The Earhart Foundation agreed in 1946 to donate $200,000 to Caltech for construction and equipment costs of labora- tories and air-conditioned greenhouses. But postwar inflation soon rendered this amount inadequate, and in 1948 the Foundation offered an additional $207,000. Building began in 1948 and the completed Earhart Laboratory was dedicated on June 7, 1949. The exterior design was modest, a one-story building resembling a "big pleasant house" with greenhouses attached and with a basement level where 49 Sage, 1992, p. 59.</page><page sequence="19">FRITS WENTS ATOMIC AGE GREENHOUSE 307 Figure 2. An external view of the phytotron, showing laboratory building and at- tached greenhouse. Courtesy of the Archives, California Institute of Technology most of the air-conditioning equipment was located (Figures 2 and 3).50 Filtering and purifying the air was itself a major technical problem be- cause the region was already heavily contaminated with smog. In fact one of the main research projects conducted in the phytotron would be to determine the composition of smog and its effect on plant health. The interior layout required team effort and the coordination of scientists, engineers, and contractor.51 Arthur Hess, the mechanical engineer who had worked with Eversole on his air-conditioned greenhouse, accom- plished the "superhuman feat" of designing systems of air ducts, hot and cold water piping, circulation pumps, air conditioners and heaters. The layout of electrical conduits, motor circuits, and lights was equally com- plex. Lighting came from incandescent lamps and from fluorescent tubes, a new technology developed largely after the war. Nearly 1 1 1,000 feet of electric wire connected all the lamps, motors and other machinery with the power supply in the transformer room.52 As Went remarked, "Dr. Eversole's remarkable intuition' for anything pertaining to living 50 Went, 1957b, p. 86. 51 Went, 1950, p. 94. 52 Ibid., p. 106.</page><page sequence="20">308 SHARON E.

Plant physiologists from Caltech, such as James F. Bonner, Arie Haagen-Smit, and Arthur Galston worked extensively in the phytotron, and many scientists from other institutions worked there for various lengths of time. The laboratory operated as a "weather factory" for the production of wind, rain and fog, and even altering the gas content of the air in special rooms. A wind tunnel in the basement could produce winds of up to 30 km per hour. Photographic equipment enabled scientists to do routine photographing of all plants growing in the greenhouses at regular intervals. The complex contained a total of 54 spaces with different conditions and plants could be moved around on wheeled tables for maximum flexibility. The idea was to be able to create any number of artificial climates, limited only by the size of the rooms and greenhouses. The central control room, the "brains of the building", had "long panels covered with dials and recorders" showing conditions in every room, with a superintendent reigning over the controls.55 53 Ibid., p. 94. 54 Ibid. In a later description Went had 14 artificially lighted rooms and 10 dark- rooms, suggesting that the original design was slightly altered. 55 Ibid., p. 97; Went, 1957a, p. 87.</page><page sequence="21">FRITS WENTS ATOMIC AGE GREENHOUSE 309 The phytotron represented a new kind of experimental mini-world whose object was to pin down the relationship between plants and the environment by making it possible to reproduce various climates in which a plant might grow. Even time was measured differently, with each day divided into one hundred "centidays" of 14 minutes and 24 seconds duration. Days were numbered starting from the opening date of the phytotron. One approached this experimental world with the precaution of a surgeon entering an operating room. Fumigants killed animals in the building, and air, water, sand, plants and humans were made as germ-free as possible. The entrance to the building was through two washrooms with lockers, one each for men and women, which functioned as decontamination chambers, in which researchers changed into sterilized laboratory clothes. Visitors donned "freshly laundered hospital gowns and caps or the regular doctor's uniforms used in operating rooms" and sprayed their shoes with DDT.56 The floor was washed regularly with insecticides, cigarettes were sterilized in auto- claves, lunch foods that might carry aphids were banned, and labora- tory notebooks were fumigated. These quarantine precautions did not completely prevent disease and pest infestations, but they kept the infestations to a manageable level. Although the first year was largely devoted to working out problems with equipment, the laboratory was soon drawing the attention of researchers, becoming, exactly as Went had hoped, a Mecca for biologists around the world. Apart from the humorous allusion to the controls of the cyclotron, the term "phytotron" suggested that the facility would serve biologists in the same way that the cyclotron served physicists, and in doing so would eventually transform the plant sciences. Reviewing the experi- mental studies of the laboratory in 1957, Went emphasized that the term "phytotron" designated a comprehensive set of laboratory spaces and growing rooms designed to achieve an unprecedented level of control over experiments. The objective was to bring order and control to experiments and resolve controversies. Many of the conflicting theories and arguments rife in plant science were the result of growing plants under non-controlled or poorly controlled conditions, he argued. As a consequence, experiments could not be reproduced, experimental evi- dence was conflicting, and unknown variables were affecting the out- come of experiments. With more precise experiments there was the possibility of creating a "theoretical biology" that was comparable to "theoretical physics," by which he presumably meant a theory on which 56 Went, 1957a, p. 48.</page><page sequence="22">310 SHARON E. KINGSLAND there was general consensus within biology.57 Not only that, but better control resulting in greater reproducibility would mean that fewer experiments could be run to substantiate a given interpretation, "which makes the research worker more efficient."58 The use of the phytotron also required thought about the selection of plants for experiments. The aim of the work was to get an "overall picture of basic plant behavior" with particular emphasis on the rela- tionship between plants and the environment.59 The plants studied had to be suited not only to the kinds of research questions being asked but also to the space itself. Some species were better for studying the effects of climate on growth or flowering, while others were selected to study the effect of environment on the germination of seeds. Limitations on space required practical decisions about size of plants. Early on, Went chose the tomato as a good organism for studying the relationship between temperature and growth. But the pea (Pisum) was smaller and more convenient, and the trend was toward smaller plants. Along with other botanists in the 1940s, Went began deliberately searching for "botanical Drosophilas" or small, widely distributed and easy to grow annuals that could be raised in large quantities.60 Research continued on orchids as well, especially a species of the genus Cattleya that had a strong response to photoperiod. A side benefit of the orchid work was production of floral gifts for the secretaries at Caltech. As Went re- marked, "We received marvelous cooperation from the various departments, especially from Buildings and Grounds."61 One might imagine that the phytotron was a forbidding environment of complex instrumentation, but Went conceived of it as a place to reconnect the experimentalist with the experimental organism, and through the process of experiment to get a feel for the reactions and responses of the organism. The phytotron was meant to encourage greater intimacy with the plant itself. The apparatus and machinery for the experiments was separate from the growing rooms and mostly 57 Ibid., p. 319. 58 Ibid., p. 321. 59 Ibid., p. 97. 60 Whyte, 1949, p. 55 for reference to "botanical Drosophilas"; Went, 1957a, p. 97; see Leonelli, 2007 on the subsequent history of botanical Drosophilas. German botanist Friedrich Laibach believed he had found the ideal plant in Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress or mouse cress, native to Europe, which eventually did become the main "botanical Drosophila") whereas Went promoted two different species, Baeria chry- sostoma (coast goldfields) and Phacelia parryae (knotweed) both native to southern California. 61 Went, 1990, p. 28.</page><page sequence="23">FRITS WENT'S ATOMIC AGE GREENHOUSE 3 1 1 installed in the basement, leaving the first floor for growing and handling of plants: "Anyone carrying out an experiment in the Earhart Laboratory is continuously in the closest contact with thousands of other living plants, all being tested for their responses, and naturally one gets an appreciation of the general validity of the response obtained with one's own experimental plants," Went explained.62 The phytotron was supposed to "reduce the complexity of response sufficiently to approach problems which formerly were submerged in a morass of statistics." Went expected his experimentalists to observe individual plants closely and not just take average measurements. The Phytotron as Cultural Force Went's ambitions were almost unlimited. He envisioned a transforma- tion in the relationship between various branches of plant science, in which the phytotron served as a key instrument linking different groups in the plant sciences. In part because of the expense of constructing and operating a phytotron, it had to be a cooperative venture involving people in academe, the government, and industry. Went suggested that in an agricultural experiment station, for example, researchers in agri- culture, horticulture, plant nutrition, plant breeding, pathology and climatology would all require a range of environmental conditions which a phytotron could provide. New interdisciplinary studies, such as agroclimatology, could advance through integrated work involving such teams, contributing both to basic science but also to specific problems in agriculture, horticulture and forestry by showing which crop varieties grew best in given locations.63 One such study at the phytotron followed a disastrous year in 1955 when, after an unusually hot summer, the tomato crop in the eastern U.S. failed.64 The Campbell Soup Company, whose tomato soup was being marketed as a key ingredient of American comfort food, stationed one of their breeders in the phytotron to breed a heat resistant and commercially acceptable tomato. The artificial envi- ronment allowed researchers to raise and test four generations a year instead of one, enabling them to create an improved tomato by 1957. Went hoped that the kind of control provided in the phytotron would persuade the practical grower and agriculturist of the value of 62 Went, 1957a, p. 327. 63 Went, 1957b. 64 Went, 1962, p. 157.</page><page sequence="24">3 1 2 SHARON E. KINGSLAND basic physiological research. Many of the experiments conducted were on plants of agricultural importance and dealt with questions of optimal conditions for growth and why crops could be grown in some regions and not in others. There was a cooperative relationship between the Caltech researchers and the Beltsville group. Sterling Hendricks worked for several months at the phytotron, while Arthur Galston from Caltech went to Beltsville to work with Hendricks and his spectrograph. The phytotron was seen as a facility that would help to fine-tune the kinds of experiments that would normally be done in the field or in greenhouses that were not as carefully controlled. Apart from these specific practical functions, Went thought the academic disciplines could also be transformed through "phytotronics." In a large botanical institute, physiologists, morphologists, ecologists, geneticists, taxonomists, and biochemists would find uses for a phyto- tron. Moreover, the phytotron would push the descriptive sciences such as ecology, morphology, anatomy, and evolution toward new and fertile experimental studies.65 Ideally it would reduce the bewildering com- plexity of field experiments through better control of variables, and would allow greenhouse experimental results to be extrapolated to the field. Finally, the phytotron was an instrument of internationalism, bringing together investigators from all continents and through this interaction fostering international understanding.66 Went imagined the phytotron as a cultural force of biological uni- fication, not just transforming disciplines and supporting interdisci- plinary endeavors, but also counter-acting the tendency toward more reductionist forms of biological research that lost sight of the whole organism and its environment. His phytotron represented a counter- cultural movement of resistance against the divisive trends of molecular biology. As he proclaimed in 1962, the year James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize, "Statements suggesting that if we knew all about DNA and RNA, we would understand the secrets of life, or that molecular biology holds the solution to the problems of biology can only be made by immature minds. Such minds are carried away by the glitter of modern physics and chemistry, and ignore the complexity of nature."67 Went wanted the phytotron to serve "all of biology, classical as well as molecular" by 03 Went, 1957a, p. 323. 66 Ibid., p. 328. Went's father also had promoted internationalism, especially through the International Union of Biological Sciences, as a way to improve the status of biology in relation to the physical sciences. See Went, 1928a. 67 Went, 1962, p. 151.</page><page sequence="25">FRITS WENT'S ATOMIC AGE GREENHOUSE 313 bringing biologists together "instead of pulling them apart, as the establishment of a separate department of molecular biology tends to do." Went of course did believe that biology should be more like physics in certain respects, but not if that meant an end to the classical bio- logical concern with whole organisms. Some reviewers of Went's book of 1957 describing his "emporium of experimental exactitude" appreciated the work conducted in the phy- totron but showed reluctance to embrace Went's views of the phyto- tron's importance for the future of botany.68 But given the expense of the phytotron, Went as director had to promote and advertize, rather than realistically assess, his product. The promotion paid off as the Earhart Laboratory became a model for similar facilities around the world. Starting in 1950 and through the 1970s, phytotrons of different size and design were built in Europe, Japan, the USSR, Canada, Tai- wan, and elsewhere in the United States.69 Two of the largest were at Gif-sur- Yvette, near Paris, built in 1958, and at Canberra, Australia (1962). Lloyd Evans of the Canberra group had spent 2 years at Cal- tech, including eighteen months in the Earhart Laboratory, where he studied photoperiodism. Returning to Australia in 1956, he joined a campaign for the creation of an Australian phytotron. Went himself contributed to the campaign at the invitation of Australia's Common- wealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, for which he wrote a report based on a tour of New Zealand and Australia in 1955. He particularly noted the value of having a phytotron in Australia for the study of autecology. In comments that strikingly echoed Shelford's words in 1953, Went wrote that "In many places, including the United States of America, ecology is now in disrepute, either because it re- mained too long in the purely descriptive stage or because of much sloppy work and thinking. With the facilities of a phytotron, ecology enters in a new, largely experimental stage, where the causal relation- ships between plant and environment can become established."70 He thought Canberra was ideally located for a phytotron and recom- mended building one the same size as the Earhart Laboratory. It was duly celebrated with an international symposium, introduced by Went, when it opened in 1962.71 68 Metcalfe, 1958; Thimann, 1958. 69 See references in Downs, 1980, for the literature on various phytotrons worldwide. 70 Went, 1956, p. 8. 71 Evans, 1963a, 2003.</page><page sequence="26">3 1 4 SHARON E. KINGSLAND In 1958 Hendricks and Went argued that the phytotron had been accepted as an experimental tool, "comparable to telescopes, particle accelerators, fossil collections, and other tools of science."72 They pointed to increased funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for controlled-environment studies, as proof of widespread interest in these tools. Went's research had received NSF funding since 1952 and the Earhart Laboratory received operating funds from NSF starting in 1956.73 Hendricks and Went, along with other scientists and engineers, were part of a committee formed in 1958 (with NSF funding) to assess the level of support within the broader scientific community, not just for phytotrons but also for "biotrons" that would include animals as well as plants. The University of Wisconsin received an NSF grant for construction of a biotron laboratory, which was operational by 1967 and was envisioned as a national or regional laboratory serving people from other institutions. The USDA research center at Beltsville acquired a phytotron in 1963. By 1970 two phytotrons were in operation in a cooperative project between Duke University and North Carolina State University, the Southeastern Plant Environment Laboratories (or SEPEL).74 While meant for the use of plant scientists in the south- eastern U.S., the facilities were available to scientists from around the world. Went left Caltech in 1958 to become Director of the Missouri Botanical Garden, where he created a different kind of controlled cli- mate facility, the Climatron. This facility was not suitable for research, and Went left 5 years later after a disagreement with the trustees to take a position at the Desert Research Institute at Reno, Nevada, where he founded a Laboratory of Desert Biology, a more modest facility than the phytotron. The Desert Research Institute now is home to the Frits Went Laboratory, a set of smaller controlled laboratories and glass houses for the study of ecosystem functions. In general the phytotron movement tapered off by the end of the 1970s, no more large facilities were built, and there was a shift to smaller controlled-environment cabinets or eco-cells, as at the Went Laboratory in Nevada. The more ambitious phytotrons and biotrons of the 1960s were too expensive to build and operate, could take years to complete, and did not in the end serve as the regional or national centers they were intended to be.75 72 Hendricks and Went, 1958, p. 510. 73 Appel, 2000, p. 183. 74 Kramer, Hellmers, and Downs, 1970. 75 Appel, 2000, pp. 183-186.</page><page sequence="27">FRITS WENTS ATOMIC AGE GREENHOUSE 3 1 5 At Caltech phytotronics continued under the direction of plant physiologist Anton Lang, and a new laboratory partly funded by the Campbell Soup Company (and known as the "soup kitchen") was ad- ded to the complex in 1960. These did not long survive Lang's departure in 1965 to become director of the Plant Research Laboratory built by the Atomic Energy Commission at Michigan State University. By this time, Lang recalled, he was the only faculty member at Caltech "still interested in plants as distinct organisms" and there was no one outside his own group with whom to discuss problems in depth.76 The decisive shift toward molecular biology and other areas of experimental biology meant the disappearance of plant research at Caltech. Its phytotron and associated laboratories and greenhouses were razed in 1972 to make way for a new laboratory for behavioral biology. There had always been tension and jealousies between the different areas of biology at Caltech because of the huge expense of running the phytotron, with others feeling that it was getting a disproportionate share of funding. Went, though enthusiastic and ambitious, did not approach his "big science" laboratory with the skills of a big-science administrator and did not do enough fund-raising, which meant that the phytotron was never self-supporting. Moreover, the scientists working in the phytotron were aware of its limitations. As Lang explained, as a scientific instrument comparable to an ultracentrifuge or computer, the phytotron determined what kind of work could be done.77 It could be inflexible: sometimes it was necessary to go outside the phytotron if special needs arose. At Michigan State he did not regret not having a full-fledged phytotron, although he believed the Caltech instrument was useful for science. But although its legacy at Caltech was mixed, the phytotron did spawn a laboratory movement, prompting similar con- structions around the world for about three decades. Putting the Laboratory into the Picture I have argued that in the lab-field borderlands scientists in the laboratory as well as scientists in the field were innovating to improve the standards of the field sciences. The key point is that Kohler's "border culture" was also "experienced and lived" within the laboratory itself, producing a new kind of laboratory that was meant to serve field scientists. It differed from the "generic place that appears in our mind's eye when we think of 76 Lang, 1980, p. 20. 77 Ibid., p. 20.</page><page sequence="28">3 1 6 SHARON E. KINGSLAND labs," from the field station or biological farm, and from the modern laboratory of biochemistry or molecular biology.78 Its work was driven by a classic problem of field research: how do organisms respond to their environments? To use Kohler's metaphor of cultural evolution, we could say that there were two "hybrid cultures" being created: one entailed devising new approaches to experiment and observation in the field, while the other entailed a reinvention of the laboratory. For this reason I would modify Kohler's claim that the development of field science required a separation from certain ideals of, laboratory culture, and emphasize the idea that, at least in some places, the laboratory itself was changing to meet the needs of field science. We should not view this as an attempt to bring the field into the laboratory, because the phytotron's purpose was not to replicate or model complex natural systems. Trying to model nature would have produced complicated experiments that would be hard to interpret. We should not confuse this kind of project with the later "Biosphere" construction in Arizona, which is an effort to simulate the earth's environment indoors.79 The values dominating in the phytotron were still laboratory values of experimental rigor, precision, and reproduc- ibility, but with attention to the study of whole organisms and to organism-environment relations. Without sacrificing the scientific ideals of the physiological laboratory, the phytotron was meant to clarify and improve upon field research. Once we put the laboratory side of the field-lab coevolutionary process into the picture, we can look for places where the two hybrid cultures were intersecting and see whether this interaction modifies our view of field research. One example of intersection involves a study that Köhler identified as a successful hybrid strategy for experimental field science: the Carnegie Institution of Washington's program in experi- mental taxonomy and evolutionary biology, represented in the work of Jens Clausen, David Keck and William Hiesey. The Carnegie labora- tory at Stanford, California, built in 1928, was a center of research on what was known as "experimental taxonomy," building on earlier transplant experiments designed to assess how plant development was affected by environment. As Köhler shows, following Hagen, this group appears to have achieved notable success in developing an interdisci- plinary or synthetic approach to problems of evolutionary biology and taxonomy.80 78 Kohler, 2002, p. 6. 79 Allen, 1991. See Hagen, 1984, for the first analysis of this Carnegie research program.</page><page sequence="29">FRITS WENT'S ATOMIC AGE GREENHOUSE 3 1 7 Kohler views the evolution of superior field strategies, such as this one, as products of growing sophistication and confidence among field researchers.81 He argues that crucial intellectual advances came when field scientists liberated themselves from slavish adherence to laboratory culture and learned instead to formulate problems and experiments that were appropriate to the field environment. When Clausen conducted transplant experiments in the field, Kohler finds it significant that he "did not relocate laboratory procedures to the field, as Shelford tried to do," nor did he "take objects from nature into the lab for experimental purposes."82 In other words, Clausen represents a successful strategy that is based on the idea of separation of cultures, a separation that liberated field scientists and allowed them room to create a new hybrid culture in the field. Kohler is no doubt correct that biologists had to learn how to perform experiments in the field and that some succeeded in these tasks better than others. But in this particular instance, if we follow the story a little further, there is a laboratory in the picture: none other than Caltech' s phytotron, for William Hiesey, Clausen's collab- orator, did in fact work extensively in the Clark greenhouses at Caltech and later in the phytotron. Went had immediately seen that his laboratory might be of use to the Carnegie researchers and had proposed that they cooperate. In the 1940s the Carnegie scientists were interested in the problem of creating new varieties of range grass, with new qualities and suited to new environ- ments, by hybridizing species from contrasting environments. Figuring out how to re-seed depleted ranges and establish grass cover on burned areas depended on knowing how temperature affected the germination of seeds. It was quite difficult at this time to judge a plant's field success from laboratory studies. The controlled laboratory environment at Caltech was meant to make it easier to predict what might occur in the field. Clausen, Keck, and Hiesey were collaborating on studies of how different races were formed in adaptation to changing environmental conditions. These "climatic races" or "ecological races" were genetically distinct, and they wanted to learn more about the relationship between ecology, physiology, and genetics. Hiesey's initial work at Caltech was part of the collaborative project.83 In 1950 he continued his phytotron studies, collaborating with Went on the study of grasses and other 81 Kohler, 2002, pp. 168-172. 82 Ibid., p. 171. 83 Clausen et al., 1948.</page><page sequence="30">3 1 8 SHARON E. KINGSLAND species.84 It at once became clear that distinct climatic races had quite different growth responses when subjected to the same temperature.85 This result suggested the need to take a closer look at the comparative physiology of ecological races. The phytotron studies helped to sharpen the questions that the scientists were asking, directing their attention to deeper study of racial differences. Hiesey imagined that experiments in controlled environments could bridge the long-standing gap between physiology and genetics and achieve a better understanding of the importance of heredity and environment in physiological and bio- chemical processes. These investigations in the 1950s promoted disci- plinary synthesis or integration of work in physiology, ecology, and genetics. In 1957 Hiesey did not think that this synthesis had been accomplished, but he did think that experiments in controlled envi- ronments were key ingredients for success. Went for his part did field research in the deserts of Southern Cali- fornia and took a keen interest in desert ecology, publishing regularly on ecological topics. In 1957 he devised a Mobile Desert Laboratory, essentially a laboratory on wheels, for studies of desert adaptations. The privately funded laboratory was based in the desert near Palm Springs and consisted of a truck and house-trailer modified into a laboratory with work tables and instruments. The truck carried water, a generator and an air compressor. Went thought of this as complementing the Earhart laboratory's work and providing an opportunity to study ani- mal as well as plant ecology. Thus the emergence of new hybrid cultures at the lab-field border resulted from complementary evolutionary changes both in the field and in the laboratory. These did not always entail emancipation of field workers from laboratory norms and standards, as Köhler argues, although in some cases such emancipation may well have occurred. But if we look at people like Went and Hiesey, there was continued inter- action between laboratory and field cultures, and more to the point, a dramatic change was going on within the laboratory, so that laboratory work could be relevant to field problems. While the values of laboratory culture - rigor and reproducibility - remained central goals, the labo- ratory itself evolved into a different kind of workplace. I would not claim that either of these cultural "hybrids" instantly overcame the difficulties of solving complex scientific questions. A major challenge was to figure out how to use phytotrons most 84 Hiesey, 1951; 1957, pp. 153-163. 85 Hiesey, 1952.</page><page sequence="31">FRITS WENT'S ATOMIC AGE GREENHOUSE 319 effectively. At the symposium in 1962 marking the opening of the phytotron in Canberra, Lloyd Evans commented on the still vexing problem of relating experimental results obtained in controlled envi- ronments to the vastly more complex conditions found in the field.86 In the discussion provoked by his paper, speakers drew attention to the computer-like nature of the phytotron, able to produce any environ- mental complex. As with the computer, it could provide "reliable, intelligible answers only when presented with intelligent, logical ques- tions."87 But the idea of the phytotron as a place where disciplines met remained an important goal. Robert Jack Downs, who had been part of the photoperiodism team at Beltsville in the 1950s and later became director of the phytotron at North Carolina State University, put it this way in 1980: "In a phytotron the gap between physiology and micro- climatology can be narrowed, ecology can become an experimental science, the genetics of response to climate can be explored and the biochemical and physiological mechanisms affected by climate stress can be identified and understood."88 One can think of such laboratories as cultural forces for scientific synthesis or interdisciplinarity, and it would be valuable to explore further how well disciplines really connect in such workplaces. Conclusion I have presented the Earhart laboratory as a place where a new hybrid culture was created at the lab-field border. There is far more to be explored to understand what these evolving practices meant for science and how they reflected broader cultural and economic trends. To reflect first on what kind of "hybrid" was produced in this high-tech labora- tory, perhaps the most surprising finding is that such a place was not the exclusive product of scientists espousing elite "laboratory values" and lacking connection to the larger social world. The role of Eversole, amateur breeder, enthusiast, and intelligent tinkerer, and of the engi- neers with whom he worked, is an important part of this story. Went appreciated how Eversole's ability to contribute to science was a result of the fact that he was not bound by rigid rules of scientific experiment. Through Eversole, Went made connections to orchid growers and expanded his interest in the scientific problems that orchids presented. 86 Evans, 1963b, p. 421. 87 Ibid., p. 435. 88 Downs, 1980, p. 485.</page><page sequence="32">320 SHARON E. KINGSLAND By looking at the lab-field border from the laboratory side we can appreciate the role of horticulture and agriculture as drivers of scientific innovation and as contributors to cultural change in science. Second, the existence of this laboratory "hybrid" suggests that the field sciences still required assistance from laboratory-based research in the 1950s, that scientists were dissatisfied with the poor level of support for field science, and that perceptions of weakness in field science still had to be countered and overcome. An important part of the postwar story of field sciences was how scientists worked to gain resources, in- crease visibility, and improve the status of their fields of research. Experiments with new kinds of laboratories were one aspect of this effort. Third, as we consider the conceptual products of science, we should be aware of how laboratories like the Earhart contributed not just to individual disciplines but also to the development of interdisciplinary fields, such as radiation biology and photobiology, that were emerging in the interwar period and continued in the postwar period. These interdisciplinary subjects could cut across the boundary of field and laboratory, involved research on different kinds of organisms, and contributed to the emergence of new general concepts that applied both to plants and animals. One such concept, for example, was the emer- gence of the idea of the "biological clock", an area of growing interest in the mid-1950s, although the term "biological clock" itself dates to the 1920s. While observations of rhythmic activity in organisms were very old, the new idea was that organisms displayed rhythmic responses because they possessed time measurement mechanisms. Because the phytotron work involved whole-organism responses to environmental changes, the research addressed the problem of circadian rhythms and the biological clock. Thus the Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Quantitative Biology in 1960, which was devoted to the subject of biological clocks, included papers by Went (then at the Missouri Botanical Garden), Sterling Hendricks, and Harry R. Highkin from Caltech.89 Although the biological clock concept owed more to zoo- logical observation and experiment, the fact that plants also displayed rhythm and were able to measure time showed the generality of the concept. Fourth, thinking more broadly about why scientific patrons such as William B. Thompson and Harry B. Earhart chose to support plant research, we can also begin to situate these scientific changes within a broader debate about food supply, population growth, war and social 89 Cold Spring Harbor Symposia, 1961.</page><page sequence="33">FRITS WENT'S ATOMIC AGE GREENHOUSE 32 1 stability, topics only lightly touched on here. Opening up the black box of the laboratory also shifts our focus to the material basis of science, and the way changes in funding, institutions, and technologies enabled certain paths to open up, perhaps closed down other paths, and deter- mined how quickly or evenly science moved along those paths. In addition, we have a vehicle for extending the narrative from the interwar period to the postwar period and examining how postwar enthusiasm for "big science" and for regional and national laboratories influenced the pursuit of classical biological problems. The larger point is that we should not think of the history of field science as a separate story from the history of the laboratory, but can see both field science and laboratory science as comprising a single story, one that connects to a larger story of American culture and enterprise. The goal of unification and connection, the search for a single story that weaves together disparate themes, was an ambition that ran through Phil Pauly's work as a historian of biology and was most clearly expressed in his final book, Fruits and Plains. In a memorial tribute to his work, we might reflect on what other opportunities exist to connect themes across fields and how we might appreciate Phil's drive, in his words, to "see the past as a whole, or more attainably, to see together the histories of the environment, agriculture, science, art, and on national development."
