Lewiston: Edwin Mellen Press, 1992. 260 pages. $69.95, Hardbound. (Reviewed by Don Webster, Oklahoma State University.) The Writings of Larry E. Axel (1946-1991): Studies in Liberal Religious Thought is the first volume of the Highlands Institute's Religious Thought Series. In addition to sixteen articles selected from the papers of Larry Axel, this memorial collection includes two essays to "acquaint the reader with the life work" of a friend and teacher: "Reflections on Creative Relational Living" by</page><page sequence="2">222 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy Art Zannoni, and "Religious Empiricism and the Problem of Religious Adequacy" by Tyron Inbody. Larry Axel was, along with Creighton Peden, the joint founder and until his death, the editor of the American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy. Those who knew Larry Axel, I feel certain, will find the book a sensitive and fitting tribute as well as a matter of record regarding the "depth" of community that has emerged among the members of the Highlands Institute for American Religious Thought. For those of us who are new to the group, the book serves as an exciting and stimulating resource affirming the creative exchange that has occurred between the participants in the Institute. At the same time, the book invites the reader to explore and assess selected essays from the life work of Larry Axel. I have found the selections a meaningful introduction to Larry Axel's life-long struggle with the significance of the Chicago School and the import such a study might have for reshaping the current theological task. I do not know just when or why Larry Axel first became interested in the Chicago School, but his doctoral dissertation at Temple University in 1975 was entitled "God or Man at Chicago: The 'Chicago School' of Theology with Special Reference to the Roles of G. B. Foster, E. S. Ames and H. N. Wieman" (82). In addition, since ten of the sixteen essays in the book are specific interpretations of the contributions of the Chicago group, there can be little doubt that Larry Axel continued to explore the merits of the Chicago School. Further, the documentation in the sixteen articles record a continued participation in conferences, interviews, and correspondence probing the theology advanced by the Chicago School. Larry Axel's friendship and interaction with Bernard Loomer and especially Bernard Meland is obvious throughout the book. A second dimension of the book presents Larry Axel's own involvement in the reconstruction of empirical theology. Six articles constitute this part of the book. Larry Axel's own contribution first surfaces in his writings regarding the Holocaust, a theme which recurs in three essays regarding religious possibilities after 1945. He calls for a bold but sensitive theological treatment of evil. The proposed reconstruction is expanded to include species extinction in a final essay, called "Ants, Humans, Gods: Revisiting and Dismissing the Old Problem of Evil," and is the only one of the sixteen that has not been previously published. In this essay, Larry Axel makes the fullest presentation of his own form of "creaturalism." The new form of creaturalism originates in part from Larry Axel's interpretation of Bernard Meland and is spelled out as a four-point task in a response to Bernard Loomer's "The Size of God" (169-174). The four-point proposal is repeated later and expanded as a new agenda for theology in "Religious Creaturalism" (207-217). The four proposals are: (1) "systematic" theology is oxymoronic and must be repudiated, (2) "theodicies"</page><page sequence="3">Vol 15, a 2, May 1994 223 are an unacceptable treatment of the problem of evil and should be abandoned, (3) "eschatological reflection" must avoid parochial and individualistic formulations, and (4) "hierarchical" thinking must be overcome. All four proposals reject aspects of accepted solutions for the problem of evil. I believe we can narrate the progress of thought in the writings of Larry Axel if we tell how the four proposals for "Creaturalism" originate in his own critical history of the Chicago School. Consequently, I will retell that story as it applies specifically to each of the four proposals and then point out how the narrative stumbles over an impasse between connectionalism in the distinct forms developed by Wieman and Loomer. My genealogy works with the supposition that the problem of evil is the integrating theme of Larry Axel's creaturalism. The Repudiation of "Systematic" Theology: The difference between rational and empirical "connectivism" is a basic episode in the genealogy of "creaturalism," but the origins of that story may be traced back to an even earlier Chicago rejection of "divine authority" as the justification of theology. For Larry Axel the problems with "systematics" begin with the Chicago School proper in the perspectives of Shatter Mathews, G. B. Foster, E. S. Ames, A. E. Haydon, and G. B. Smith. The major accomplishment of these members of the Divinity School rests in their sociohistorical approach to religious studies. The sociohistorical method was used to reject any appeal to "sacred texts" as transhistorical authorities with a privileged revelation. Rather, the ideas in religious traditions are explained functionally by the Chicagoans as adaptations to specific environmental situations. The procedure had its roots in the pragmatism of William James and the instrumentalism of John Dewey. The pragmatic source had added significance in the Chicago adoption of a social rather than an individual stance toward religious experience. The drift of the school's development of the sociohistorical method was from theism to humanism. The arrival at Chicago in 1926 of . N. Wieman registers, according to Larry Axel, a "new turn" in theological method. Wieman introduced the earlier Chicago School to Whitehead and "connectionalism." The immediate correction Wieman sought was a rejection of humanism with an empirical clarification of theism. In Wieman's case in the Divinity School, unlike that of Charles Hartshorne in the philosophy department, the affirmation of theism was guided by an empirical method rather than upon a rational a priori stance. The empirical approach was developed further along "process" or "connectionalist" lines by Bernard Loomer. Loomer7 s dissertation became the Divinity School handbook for "process thought." The empirical outlook was given additional support when Bernard Meland, a student of G. B. Smith, returned as a faculty member in 1946.</page><page sequence="4">224 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy Larry Axel's own development is formulated by his reflection on the theological significance of these events. The sociohistorical method freed religious studies from "authority" and the empirical method freed them from rational abstraction. His friendship with Bernard Meland strengthened Larry Axel's orientation toward lived experience with an abhorrence of rational abstractions. Thus, Larry Axel's project of creaturalism starts from a disaffection with "systemic argument." Theodicy Does Not Address the Problem of Evil: Another concern Larry Axel explored in his tale of the sociohistorical method was its drift toward humanism. The significance of Wieman, in Larry Axel's story, is his return to soteriological theism: "God is to be identified only with that within the universe which is creative of human personality and its highest fulfillment" (127). Further, Wieman asserts "a contextual orientation" in place of a "cosmological" one (127). The problem with Wieman's approach is that "the Ultimate was almost always rendered in terms of the source of human good" (242). This scenario is critical for Larry Axel. First, his study of the Holocaust raised questions about the superiority of human reason. Second, his ecological interest raised serious doubts about humanism as mere "species-egotism" (245). Anthropocentrism is understood as the misguided exaltation of human reason or any other characteristic which privileges the human species. A "species-centric" outlook magnifies "tribalism" when it privileges connections between God and human fulfillment. Bernard Loomer complicates the issue with his claim that God and world must be identified, since the "stature" of God requires both the highest intensity and integrity of life that human fulfillment can accommodate even when it accepts the empirical ambiguity of God regarding good and evil. Loomer inverts the cosmological and the contextual position adopted by Wieman (171-173). The Wieman-Loomer difficulty with theism is modified by Bernard Meland who holds exclusively to neither a contextual nor a cosmic theism, but expounds a "mystical naturalism" instead (212-213). The creative presence of God, according to Bernard Meland, is never as clear and specific as alleged by Wieman. Rather, God is experienced ambiguously, both locally and cosmically. The ambiguity even in sensitive awareness means one cannot speak of God apart from fallible forms and symbols that respect the human margins of intelligibility. Nevertheless, Meland insists that human life must rise above its drift toward mediocrity (115). Larry Axel's account ends in perplexity over an impasse between "fulfillment" and "ambiguity." Eschatology Must Overcome Species-Egocentrism: According to Larry Axel, supernaturalism has promoted individual human immortality and humanism has promoted species utopianism. Both eschatologies set an ideal</page><page sequence="5">Vol 15, No. 2, May 1994 225 goal as the lure or reward for personal moral achievement Larry Axel is distressed that there is a loss of moral incentive when these "tribal" sorts of justification for the moral meaning of life are dispelled. He suggests that a third way is available in the creatural stance of Bernard Meland. First, Meland recognizes that there is an unavoidable tragic sense in lived experience (237). Second, for Meland, religion does not provide a pure principle of perfection governing the connectedness of all lived experiences (236). Following Meland's insights, Larry Axel recommends that the image of the "suffering servant" be substituted for the usual goal of self fulfillment or "growth" as the measure of "stature" (240). With this measure the ants have some degrees of achievement above humans (241). Hierarchiai Thinking Overcome: The focus of Larry Axel's story of the Chicago School regarding "hierarchiai" thinking rests primarily with his responses to Loomer and Meland. He discounts Wieman's theism as overly constricted toward the human good just as the drift of the sociohistorical period was toward the human realization of collective ideals. However, what exercises him most is the difference between the ambiguity over good and evil in Loomer's identification of God with the total world. For Larry Axel, Loomer's account of God stands in sharp contrast with Meland's affirmation of a tragic sense of life coupled with an appreciative awareness of "grace" in both the "cosmic matrix" and the "contextual matrix." Larry Axel believes that Meland offers a third way that embraces neither the humanistic nor the theistic pole in the debate over meaningful life. "As a third alternative, he sought to draw attention to religion as relating more to an aesthetic mode of experiencing one's earthrootedness and to renounce a view of religion as a more narrowly conceived theological or moral witness" (109). Axel concludes from his interview of Meland that "we need to realize that there are alternatives other than supernaturalistic dualism or an anthropomorphism that results in nothing more significant than a worship of humanity. Neither cosmology is consistent with modern knowledge or with the drama of human sensibilities toward the life-forces that surround and sustain us" (115). I find Larry Axel's use of the Chicago School and his creative interaction with Wieman, Loomer, and Meland very intriguing. That so much progress can be made toward earth wisdom in this manner is a commendation of the Chicagoans and Larry Axel. However, I have promised a last word concerning an alleged impasse. Larry Axel's creaturalism belabors an impasse between Wieman's contextualism and Loomer's totalism in an effort to find a warrant that reinforces his preference for Meland's sensitivity continuous with nature. I want to suggest that the missing warrant lies in the often ignored value of "place." A residual anthropocentric abstraction lies with process thought's quest for</page><page sequence="6">226 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy life's meaning in cosmopolitan totalities rather than in the creative relations between creatures dwelling in finite ecosystems. "Being at home in the universe," presupposes a niche in one or more ecosystems. Despite great mobility and cosmic aspirations, individual humans are locally embodied dwellers. Ecosystems depend on shared sensitivity to "momentary" balances in the local webs of life. Globalism must be felt contextually. Only through earth dwelling sensitivity can the individual as fellow sufferer flourish over mediocrity. Any impasse in Larry Axel's struggle to maintain the intensity of life, the integrity of being, and an adequate "religious creaturalism" can be overcome in the context of Meland's structured experiences enriched by a sense of "place."</page></plain_text>
