<plain_text><page sequence="1">News and Notes The Maya ruins of Lamay, Quintana Roo, Mexico GRAZ (Karl Herbert Mayer). The important and large Maya ruins of Tzibanche are located in the southern part of the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, close to the modern settle ment of Morocoy. The ruins were discovered by the British explorer Thomas Gann in 1927 (Gann 1927; 1935), who also discovered another, smaller ruin nearby named Kinichna. The geographical location of both sites was determined by Mexicon staff member Stephan Merk in 1998 with a hand held GPS navigator and gave the following results: Tzibanche: latitude 18° 39.53' North, longitude 88° 45.53' West, and Kinichna: latitude 18° 39.53' North, longitude 88° 46.11' West. The site name of Tzibanche, used for a long time since the discovery by Gann (for example: Harrison 1973; Mayer 1982; Lopez de la Rosa and Velazquez 1991) has in recent years changed its spelling to Dzibanche (as in, e.g., Nalda 1994; Nalda et al. 1994; Nalda and Lopez 1995; Campana 1995). In the environs of the two ruins another site was discov ered which is named Tutil, also spelt Tut'til and T'ut'il (Lopez de la Rosa and Velazquez 1991; Mayer 1991). An archaeological map in an unpublished report of 1997 by Luz Evelia Campana Valenzuela (published by Nondédéo 2003, Fig. 51), shows the location of Dzibanche, Kinichna, Tutil, as well as two other groups of ruins in the general Dzibanche region, namely Ka'tali and Lamay. In 1993-1994 the Mexican Instituto Nacional de Antropo logfa e Historia (INAH) initiated an extensive archaeological IUIMJUIMIU LAIVIW I "K &lt;D 1 PLAZA ALTA 2 TEMPLO DE LAS COLUMNAS 3 TEMPLO SURESTE 4 TEMPLO NORESTE 5 TEMPLO PRINCIPAL 6 PLAZA BAJA H Conjunto Lamay es uno de !os grupos arçuitectonfces monumentales que, junto con Kinichna, Tutil y Ka'tali, formai» parte del gran asentamiento prehispanico conocido como Diibanehe.

Nalda considers the sites of Kinichna, Tutil and Lamay as peripherical groups of Dzibanche and not as separate archaeological sites. He de scribes the five obviously distinct ruins as "grupos" or "complejos", groups or complexes. The INAH project par ticularly focused on the excavation, consolidation, and resto ration of architecture at Dzibanche and Kinichna. Whereas the sites, groups, or architectural complexes of Dzibanche, Kinichna, and the unrestored Tutil are already partially pub lished in the archaeological literature, Lamay still remains unpublished. This site, probably formerly named "Complejo Central" (Nalda et al. 1994:19), is located approximately 1 km north west from the centre of Dzibanche, and about the same distance east of Tutil. When visited in March of 2004, Lamay was closed to the public because it was in the process of restoration by INAH personnel. Nevertheless the architec tural complex could be seen and photographed from outside the restricted area by passing visitors, who visited the now excellently restored and easily accessible ruins of Dzibanche and Kinichna. A large sign erected by INAH (Fig.l), placed outside of the ruins, provides a plan view without scale of the core zone of the "Conjunto Lamay" and gives a brief descrip tion in Spanish of this site which will here be partially Fig. 3.

The principal structure of the complex is an acropolis consisting of eight edifices distributed above two basements. The one sited to the east was constructed at the beginning of the Early Classic (300 - 600 D.C.), a large basement of three com pounds with mouldings on the front and a central staircase, possibly flanked by stucco masks; in the Late Classic (600 - 900 D.C.) these edifices were remodelled and according to new needs a large row of residential spaces was built between the Southeast Temple and the Northeast Temple". The so-called acropolis of Lamay encompasses, accord ing to this INAH information, a higher and a lower plaza, the Temple of the Columns, the Southeast Temple, the Northeast Temple, and the Principal Temple. Presently, the acropolis is not entirely free of debris and is partially obscured by veg etation, such as bushes and trees (Fig. 2). However, the excavations have revealed many architectural details, such as rectangular openings in the exterior walls, as well as the typical small limestone slabs used in the construction of large masonry structures in Late Classic times (Figs. 3, 4). When the restoration work by INAH at Lamay is completed, another important site within the Dzibanche region of Southern Quintana Roo will be accessible to the public. Fig. 2. The acropolis of Lamay.

Moreover, the mu seum displays many other pieces made of jade and greenstone, collars, earrings, and different weapons, like stone knifes and lance points, as well as excentrics made of flintstone and obsidian. The aforementioned "Cancuen Panel", dating to the late eighth century A.D., is the most famous artwork of the museum; although of unknown provenance it has been gen erally ascribed to the large Classic Maya site of Cancuen on the Rio de la Pasion in the Southern Peten (Scheie and Grube 1994; Mayer 1995a, b: 40-42; Fahsen and Jackson 2002; Guenter 2002; Kistler 2004). The roughly rectangular panel is complete, is 94 cm high,138 cm high, and 14 cm thick. The textual image encompasses 160 beautifully carved glyph-blocks (A1-P10), arranged into 16 columns and 10 rows and features several times the Emblem Glyph of Cancuen. The panel, allegedly looted around 1970, is known since at least 1981, has been offered for sale in 1994 in Guatemala City and since 2000 has been displayed in the museum in Coban, where it can be publicly seen and in spected for the first time. For the kind permission to take photos in the museum and to publish them, I wish to express my gratitude to Gladys de Deulofeu of the Museo del Principe Maya, Cobân.

During July and August of2004, members of the Ndaxagua project carried out an anthropo logical investigation in a colossal natural tunnel near Tepelmeme de Morelos, in the Coixtlahuaca basin of north western Oaxaca. The work, generously funded by the Foun dation for the Advancement in Mesoamerican Studies, en gaged investigators from Brandeis University in Boston, Brigham Young University in Utah, and the Universidad de las Américas in Cholula. The research goals aimed at produc ing a topographic map of the through-cave to accurately determine its dimensions and to properly locate a rich body of Prehispanic inscriptions painted on the walls. A second ob jective was to generate a thorough documentation of the paintings using multi-spectral and conventional photographic techniques. In addition, the project members conducted a survey of the tunnel and of several hilltops in its immediate vicinity to better contextualize the use of the cave through time. Conversations with indigenous peoples by the team's socio-cultural anthropologist sought to elucidate the role played by the tunnel in the local social memory and cultural imagination. The tunnel was the setting for multiple episodes of paint ing during Prehispanic times, but the great majority of the documented imagery can be dated stylistically between the 5th and 9th centuries A.D. While the inscriptional conven Fig. 10. A ceramic decorated head and a shell ornament (photo: Karl .. , .. . ... ,. , . , , . .. ..

The samples of ceramic fragments collected inside the tunnel and in most of the surrounding human settlements detected by the survey yielded, among other wares, an ubiquitous red on buff pottery with close ties with the "Coyotlatelco" complexes from the Central Highlands, a widespread set of ceramic traditions that immediately post date the maximum peak of political centralization at Teotihuacan. Some of the Nuine inscriptions appear superimposed, a phenomenon that poses interpretative difficulties in deter mining syntagmatic relations between groups of paintings. Various semiological processes could account for such over lapping, including palimpsests, formal, and/or functional symbolic relationships. Few well-bounded narratives are present, and many of the paintings involve signs accompa nied by numbers rendered with bars and dots. The lack of any instance of the known versions of the Nuine year glyph strongly suggests that such glyphs have a nominative func tion, referencing the names of individuals according to the day in which they were born. Although those names are indexical to the ancient regional calendrical system, they do not signal chronological properties. In this regard, the Nuine paintings in the tunnel may resemble the most recent inscrib ing practices at the locale. Since the 1950s, the walls of the through-cave have become a canvas to write in the Spanish alphabetic script "Recuerdos" that memorialize the presence of visitors to a place that, given its monumentality, inspires much awe. Such apprehension of the natural landscape must have had added ideological dimensions in antiquity, given the known perception of caves as portals to the under world and to origins. Lienzo de Quauhquechollan shows Spanish conquest of Guatemala LEIDEN (Netherlands Organization For Scientific Research). In her PhD studies of the Lienzo de Quauhquechollan, Florine Asselbergs (Leiden University, Netherlands) has discovered the Spanish conquest of Guatemala portrayed on an indigenous painting. It depicts a landscape with roads, rivers and places where battles and the associated events are marked. Until recently, it had been thought that the painting represented campaigns of conquest by the Quauhquecholteca and Spaniards through Central Mexico. However, Asselbergs established that the document portrays a campaign of conquest through Guatemala by the Spanish conqueror Jorge de Alvarado in 1527-1529. It forms an extremely detailed and unique indigenous report of an otherwise scarcely chronicled period, and is also the oldest map of Guatemala. The lienzo records the history of the Quauhquecholteca who settled around 1400 in the area of present-day San Martin Huaquechula, to the south-east of Mexico City. The Lienzo de Quauhquechollan is now housed in a museum in Puebla, Mexico.

Call for papers for the new journal: LACES SAN DIEGO (Leon Zamosc). Latin American and Caribbean Ethnic Studies (LACES) is a new cross-disciplinary journal for quality research on ethnicity, race relations, and indig enous peoples in Latin America and the Caribbean. The editorial board consists of Jorge Duany (Univ. de Puerto Rico), Wolfgang Gabbert (Univ. Hannover), Tanya Korovkin (Univ. of Waterloo), Joanne Rappaport (Georgetown Univ.), Rhoda Reddock (Univ. of the West Indies), Peter Wade (Univ. of Manchester) and Leon Zamosc (Univ. of California, San Diego, Editor-in-Chief). LACES is open to case studies, comparative analyses and theoretical contributions that reflect innovative and critical perspectives, focused on any country or countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, written by authors from any where in the world. The journal welcomes scholarly work from all the relevant disciplines in the Social Sciences and the Humanities. Its primary interest is on manuscripts that are analytically inspired by the problematics of ethnic studies; i.e., works that contribute to knowledge and debates about the construction of cultural difference and its consequences. Latin American and Caribbean Ethnic Studies - LACES will be launched in 2006. The journal is published by Routledge (Taylor and Francis Group). Contributions are now invited for the early issues of the journal. Submissions will be considered for the following sections: Articles: Regu lar research papers (about 12000 words). Research Notes: Short research papers (about 6000 words). Perspectives: Papers that provide synthetic overview, conceptual discus sion, critical commentary, or historical perspective (about 6000 words). Papers accepted for review are evaluated anonymously by at least two referees. Final decisions on publication rest with the journal's editors. Notes on style, reference system, and the procedure for the submission of papers are available on the LACES website at: &lt;http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/ 17442222.asp&gt;. The journal's language of publication is English. Since translations are difficult and costly, authors who write in Spanish, Portuguese, and other Latin American or Caribbean languages may want to know that a paper has been accepted before having it translated to English. LACES will be ready to receive and review papers in these languages. Their final acceptance, however, will be condi tioned on the submission of a translation of publishable quality.
