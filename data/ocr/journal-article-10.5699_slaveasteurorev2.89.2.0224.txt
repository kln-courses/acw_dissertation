<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> SEER, Vol. 89, No. 2, April 2011 Rozanov, the Creation, and the  Rejection of Eschatology ADAM URE I Vasilii Rozanov (1856–1919) was one of the most important thinkers  and religious commentators of Russia’s pre-revolutionary period,  although his contribution to the development of Russian philosophy,  and to Russian religious and social affairs, has been seriously over- looked in Western scholarship. Rozanov is perhaps best known in the  West for the fragmentary, poetic style of his later writings known infor- mally as the Opavshelistika, which includes the 1912 Uedinennoe (Solitaria)  and the two ‘baskets’ of Opavshie list ́ia (Fallen Leaves) of 1913 and 1915,  but he also wrote many hundreds of essays and articles on Russian  religious affairs which had a profound and lasting influence on the  teachings of the Russian Orthodox Church, on government policy, and  also on the course of Russian philosophy, and this aspect of his work  has not yet received due attention. Rozanov’s career can be loosely divided into three periods. The first,  lasting from around 1886–99 and roughly corresponding with his work  as a schoolmaster in the Russian provinces, is marked by his concern  with universal schemes of epistemology and history. Inspired most  directly by Fedor Shperk and Konstantin Leont ́ev, but also by Hegel  and Slavophile theories of integral knowledge, Rozanov lays out his  thinking on the nature of the cosmos and its organic development. In  his first work, O ponimanii (On Understanding, 1886), he examines the  origin of being, arguing against positivism for a type of understanding  which recognizes the underlying unity of phenomena. This unity is  underlined by a common origin of all things in the Creator. This work  underpins the rest of the Rozanov oeuvre, in that (following predomi- nantly from Aristotle) he examines the physical world in terms of its  activity, rather than its being. Rozanov examines closely the processes  of creatorship, and also how these lead to an obligation on humanity  to reach an understanding of the world through experience. This marks the theoretical foundations for the practical examinations  which dominate Rozanov’s second period, approximately from when  Adam Ure lives in London, and writes on Russian intellectual and cultural history, with a  particular emphasis on the work of Vasilii Rozanov. </page> <page sequence="2"> adam  ure 225 he took up full-time employment at Suvorin’s Novoe Vremia in 1899 to  his turn to the Opavshelistika in 1911, and which constitutes the focus of  this article. Rozanov in considerable depth examines the consequences  for society of a religious outlook, dominated by the Russian Orthodox  Church, which ignores the importance of the origins of the universe  and subsequently sees the material world as alienated from the Divine.  Rozanov argues that the Church teaches humankind that this Earth is  necessarily sinful until its final redemption at the eschaton. Therefore,  according to Rozanov, the Church is inherently pessimistic as it  preaches that salvation can only be found through a disassociation  from the material realm, encouraging us to seek death; he finds to back  up his claims numerous examples of Russians who believe that earthly  existence is sinful and who cultivate physical suffering as a result, who  are trapped in miserable marriages, who murder their illegitimate  children out of shame, or who escape the supposed evil of material  existence through suicide. The third period, which lasts the rest of Rozanov’s life, is marked by  his feverish composition of his ‘leaves’, which have been subsequently  compiled and released as several books. Despite their seemingly  chaotic style, there is a deeper unity to the Opavshelistika in that it marks  the natural culmination of what had come before. If Rozanov’s early  career was a search for a deeper underlying theoretical framework  which is only fleshed out in the practical examinations of his second  period, his final stage is the point where Rozanov himself responds to  his earlier calls for humanity to respond to the creativity of the Divine  through its own religious activity. This is manifested in the production  of a holy (for Rozanov) type of writing where creative practice is often  privileged over its content. Nevertheless, all these periods are tied  together by Rozanov’s fidelity to the origins of being, making him in  some ways a strikingly honest thinker. Rozanov’s reputation within Russian philosophy has been under- mined by claims of inconsistency; the criticism of opponents such as  Struve and Trotskii, who were unwilling to discern an underlying  framework to his writings, persists. There are glaring contradictions in  some of what Rozanov writes. However, I contend that such superficial  inconsistencies are underpinned by a deeper search for the correct  response to God’s love for the world. I concur with Galkovskii’s conten- tion that Rozanov’s outlook was consistent throughout his life, unlike  some of his perhaps more famous peers who fundamentally changed  their views during their careers, but who are paradoxically not charged  with similar accusations of inconsistency.1 Indeed, I go further by  arguing that Rozanov was in many respects a fundamentalist thinker.  1 Dmitrii Galkovskii, ‘Zakruglennyi mir’, in Beskonechnyi tupik, 2 vols, Moscow, 2008, 2,  pp. 1078–1100 (pp. 1080–81). </page> <page sequence="3"> 226 rozanov  and  the  creat ion He participates in the general climate where thinkers felt able to  challenge the position of the Church, and Rozanov acknowledges his  debt to Solov ́ev for paving the way in this respect.2 However, once  Rozanov has put into place his own rival version of Christianity (which  does in itself contain many formal aspects of Orthodox doctrine, as  well as a reliance on Old Testament thinking), he then preserves the  Church’s uncompromising approach to religious truths. Curiously, no  commentator has yet picked up on Leporskii’s charge that Rozanov  wanted to replace the dogma of the established Church with his own  dogma.3 However, in his uncompromising view that man is obliged  constantly to renew his ties with God through the repeated experience  of creativity, Rozanov opens a new way of thinking about the  relationship between dogma and experience. In this article, I examine principally Rozanov’s second period, as  during this fruitful time he integrates his former theories on the origins  and nature of the cosmos with a long and detailed study of the theol- ogy and teaching of the Russian Orthodox Church. This works across  many hundreds of articles in various periodicals calling into question  the Church’s official position on many issues of Russian life, but  predominantly on birth and death. The consequences of God’s  Creation of the Earth form always the central point of Rozanov’s  thought, and it is therefore possible to treat his ideas to a large extent  synchronically rather than diachronically. This is not an attempt to  impose upon Rozanov’s way of thinking a rigid system, but is rather  an effort to identify the central concerns that run through his works  and provide them with an underlying unity. These form the core of  Rozanov’s project to re-orientate Russian religiosity and culture more  broadly around the origins of being, and not its end. This question of eschatology is one of the most important in Russian  culture.4 The question of the end of time, however this is construed,  2 For a sophisticated examination of Solov ́ev’s challenge to Church doctrine and his  influence on subsequent religious philosophy in Russia, see V.

Novoselov, among several other contemporaries, agreed. 4 Most commentators appear to ascribe Russian eschatology to the influence of  Orthodox apocalypticism. Billington writes that the fathers of the Eastern Church ‘willed  to Orthodox Christendom a penchant for believing that the Christian Empire of the East  might yet be transformed into the final, heavenly kingdom’; he also discusses ‘the flight into  apocalyptic prophecy’ which the Russians adopted from the Byzantines.

In his examination of the history of Russian philosophy, Berdiaev also examines the  strong eschatological aspect of Russian culture. He writes: ‘The Russian people, by its  metaphysical nature and its calling in the world is a people of the end. The Apocalypse  always played an important role among the people, and among the higher cultural ele- ments, for Russian writers and thinkers.’ Nikolai Berdiaev, Russkaia ideia: Osnovye problemy  russkoi mysli XIX veka i nachala XX veka, Paris, 1971, p. 195. </page> <page sequence="4"> adam  ure 227 has been a dominant factor in Russian religion, and Russian religious  thought. This issue became more pressing in the pre-revolutionary  period, with growing political and social upheaval making the ushering  in of a new world more likely.5 In examining the reasons for the  importance of eschatology in Russian culture, it has been argued  that the apocalyptic nature of Orthodox Christianity has had a long  influence in Russia, and also on the development of modern Russian  philosophy.6 The eschatological orientation of Eastern Christianity emerges from  its specific emphasis on the Resurrection of Christ.7 The Resurrection,  although the central event in all Christian denominations, has a spe- cific prominence in Orthodoxy, and by extension, in Russian religious  philosophy.8 The focus of the Orthodox worshipper is turned away  from earthly existence as it is in the present, to the eventual transfigu- ration of the world at the end of time. Although Orthodoxy presents  the world as innately holy, as it has been created by God, this sanctity  is contingent on its final redemption at the eschaton. The physical  world is presented as matter-in-waiting, which has little value in itself  other than in the way it points to the eventual salvation of man. For Vasilii Rozanov, this eschatological focus of Orthodoxy per- meated all aspects of Russian culture. Rozanov contends that the  Orthodox Church has taught the Russian people that the physical  world is detached from God, and that salvation can only be attained  in the next world.9 For Rozanov, this hostility within Orthodoxy  to physical experience is intrinsically linked to its eschatology and its  5 This is discussed in various places by Katsis.

Katsis, Russkaia eskhatologiia i russkaia  literatura, Moscow, 2000, pp. 12–14. 6 Berdiaev, Russkaia ideia, p. 197. 7 Eastern Christianity is focused clearly on the eschatology of Christ’s life: ‘The West  focuses more on the humanity of Christ, on the earthly life and death of Jesus, whereas the  East views the mystery of the incarnation as a theophany and hence sees it in the light of  the resurrection, which is the basis of salvation.’ The Encyclopedia of Christianity.

Gustafson, Madison, WI,  1996, pp. 31–48 (p. 38). 9 There is a basis to Rozanov’s line of argument. In formal Orthodox teaching, inspired  by the teachings of the Pseudo-Dionysius on apophaticism, God is in His Essence com- pletely separate from the Earth and human experience; communion with the Energies of  the Divine is only possible through the denial of this world.

Rozanov sees the Russian  Orthodox Church as dominated by a morbid fascination with death  and by asceticism, with monks and priests teaching their flock to shun  this world and seek death instead.10 He also argues that the Orthodox  Church rejects marriage, sexual activity and childbirth, which stand at  the centre of his own approach to religion. In this paper, I examine Rozanov’s rejection of the eschatology  in Russian Orthodox teaching, and in Russian culture more broadly.  His focus is not a speculative paradise at the end of time, but one that  he locates within human experience, in the Garden of Eden. The  image of Eden as narrated in the Old Testament is for Rozanov the  defining aspect of religiosity, providing for him the proof that the ideal  has already been experienced by humankind, and is a condition which  it is possible to restore. In the first section of this article, I shall examine the ambiguities  in Orthodox doctrine in its evaluation of the physical world, which  Rozanov explores in his investigations of what he perceives to be  the Church’s overwhelming pessimism. I pay particular attention to a  lecture delivered to the Religious-Philosophical Society in 1907, in  which Rozanov posits the figure of Jesus Christ as the reason for the  Church’s eschatology, and conclude by noting that Rozanov’s approach  has consequences for the development of an ‘experiential dogmatics’. II The doctrine of the Orthodox Church towards the material world is in  many ways ambiguous. Formally, it teaches that the Earth is holy, as  it was created by God. The Incarnation of God in Jesus Christ upholds  this, and also provides the model for physical elements of Orthodox  worship. Yet creation in Orthodoxy is only defined in terms of its  movement towards its final transfiguration at the end of time.11 The  world’s sanctity rests on the promise of a future event; historicity  is necessarily unified with eschatology, only made possible through  10 Rozanov and his peer Leont ́ev both see the Russian Orthodox Church as dominated  by monasticism, which Leont ́ev welcomes, and Rozanov rejects. See Frederick C.  Copleston, Philosophy in Russia: From Herzen to Lenin and Berdyaev, Notre Dame, IN, 1986,  p. 195. Berdiaev considers Rozanov’s depiction of Orthodoxy as monastic a caricature.

Ultimately, the holiness of  matter is confirmed through the death of Christ. Therefore, in terms  of the reality of the Kingdom of God, the Orthodox worshipper is  confronted with the ‘already’, and yet at the same time, the ‘not yet’;  the world is constituted as matter-in-waiting.12 The Resurrection takes  precedence over all other events in Christological activity, including the  birth of Christ and the activity of God the Father.13 By making deification contingent on the death of Christ, the  Orthodox Church teaches that salvation can only be achieved after our  own deaths. Asceticism becomes a dominant aspect of Orthodoxy, for  example as in the work of Nil Sorskii, one of the most revered Russian  saints: Meditate on the brevity of our earthly life. Let us be concerned with the  hour of our death by not giving ourselves over to the worries of this  world and to unprofitable cares. ‘Every person crumbles to dust,’ says Holy  Scripture. In spite of the fact that we and the whole world seemingly  are in charge of ourselves, nevertheless, let us abide in the grave, taking  nothing there of this world, neither beauty nor glory nor power; no honors  nor any other temporal good creature [. . .]  Thus we should keep in mind the thought of our Lord’s Second Coming  and our resurrection and the Last Judgement, recalling that our Lord  taught about these future events found in his Gospel.14 The concept of kenosis has fed more widely into Russian culture.  In her seminal work, Gorodetskaia argues that humility, modelled on  the suffering and death of Christ, has become a national ideal.15 It is  this apparent desire to suffer in this world which Rozanov rejects in  Russian Orthodoxy. Rozanov sees Orthodoxy as dominated by a teach- ing that people must seek suffering and death.16 Another consequence  of this issue is that, according to Rozanov, Orthodoxy teaches that this  world is alienated from God and inherently satanic.17 The Russian  12 Vassiliadis, Eucharist and Witness, p. 52. Zizioulas describes at length how the Orthodox  understand the world as holy, but also in need of future redemption; this in turn has led  to problems in reconciling the concepts of history and eschatology, leading to the privileg- ing of the latter.

Any suggestion  that the idea is privileged over the material would imply an inherent  deficiency to the world which could only be overcome at a subsequent  descent of the Logos. Rozanov also draws heavily on the Christian concept of imitatio Dei.  God has granted all living things, including humans, the possibility of  achieving this by placing in them the potential to repeat the Creation  through sexual union. Rozanov sees God as bisexual, comprising  a male and female component which come together to create. Rozanov  rejects the tradition of Sophiology in Russian philosophy, and argues  that his peers have mistaken the feminine aspect of the divine. This also  reveals much about Rozanov’s unique manipulation of ancient and  modern. When the world was created, of course it was whole, ‘finished’: but it  was dull. God (the gods) said: ‘Let us give it splendour!’ And the gods  created — the countenance. I always make the mistake of saying in the old  way ‘God’, when for a long time we should say Gods; for there are two of  them, Elo-him, and not Elo-ah (singular form). It is time for us to abandon  this error, given to us by theological thoughtlessness. There are two Gods  — His masculine aspect, and the feminine aspect. This former aspect is that  ‘Eternal Feminine’, the world’s femininity, of which everyone has started  18 Rozanov sees sin as a real and present phenomenon, which emerges from our rejection  of God’s command to multiply and constitutes the subordination of our nature to our  intellect. See especially V. V. Rozanov, ‘Grekh’, in Okolo narodnoi dushi: Stat ́i 1906–1908 gg.,  ed. A. N. Nikoliukin, Moscow, 2003, pp. 347–55 (p. 349). 19 See V. V. Rozanov, ‘Beloe khristianstvo’, in Okolo narodnoi dushi, pp. 99–106 (p. 100).  The opposition between a creation-based world-view and an eschatological religiosity also  emerges in Berdiaev’s studies. Berdiaev insists the eschatological world-view is the norm in  Russian philosophy, and that the ‘elemental’ approach to religion is surprisingly rare in his  country; Rozanov is Berdiaev’s major exception. See Berdiaev, Russkaia ideia, p. 199. 20 Rozanov depicts a cosmos whose principal component is not the atom, but the  eternally-flowing semen of God. See his letter of 9 March 1918 (O.S.) to Gollerbakh,  reprinted in E. F. Gollerbakh, V. V. Rozanov: Zhizn ́ i tvorchestvo, Paris, 1976, p. 43. 21 V. V.

Just as in people — daughters are  the image of the father, and sons of the mother.22 This rejection of Sophiology has important consequences for the  relationship in Rozanov’s thought between dogma and the individual,  to which I shall return briefly below. God has placed in nature male  and female elements of each species and granted them the potential  to come together and repeat His work. This is experienced sexually,  therefore sexual desire is the holiest and most natural expression of  man’s desire for reunion with God. He writes: ‘This is the “unseen  copulation”, which is the reason for all “that is seen”. It is strange.  But it is true. All nature, of course, is the “copulation of things”, the  “sexuality of things”.’23 It is this activity which supports the relationship of the individual to  the universal for Rozanov. He looks to the activity through which the  individual realizes his potential, overcoming his isolation and achieving  reintegration into the universal. Sex for Rozanov is the fulfilment of  personality, and can lead to immortality. This contrasts strongly with  many of his opponents, in particular Merezhkovskii, who argued that  sex leads to the dissolution of the person, and is therefore similar to  death in its function.24 In the period in question, Rozanov applies his philosophical  approach to an examination of theology and its influence on Russian  culture. Rozanov combined his expertise in philosophy with a detailed  knowledge of Scripture. Like Hegel, Rozanov believes that both reli- gion and philosophy share the same subject of inquiry. Both these fields  inform and justify each other in Rozanov’s approach, which shares  certain aspects with Christian apologetics, but also with Solov ́ev.  Rozanov locates the foundation to his approach in the passage in  Genesis that narrates the Creation of the world by God, and which is  immediately followed by God’s command that man should be fruitful  and multiply. This makes explicit the links between Creation and the  obligation placed on humans to produce children; despite Rozanov’s  openness to creativity, there are aspects of his thought which are  strangely deontological. Humanity cannot escape the command to  procreate. 22 Vasilii Rozanov, Liudi lunnogo sveta: Metafizika khristianstva, St Petersburg, 2003, p. 58. 23 V. V. Rozanov, Poslednie list ́ia, ed. A. N.

In his approach to sex and death, Merezhkovskii anticipates to some degree the ideas  of Georges Bataille. </page> <page sequence="9"> 232 rozanov  and  the  creat ion God created the world (‘Genesis’, ‘The Engendering’, the ‘Bara Elohim . . .’)  and the human in it, as the crown of everything, the beloved creature of  God; and He formed a union with this human; and the human stood,  enchanted by the world, and started himself to create, to make, ‘to  decorate’, without sorrow or concern.25 Sexual activity is at the forefront of his engagement with Church  teaching, and he believes that it is wrong to condemn sexual activity,  within or outside the formal bonds of marriage. Rozanov concedes that  the Church might accept marriage in its teachings, but he believes that  this is a reluctant acceptance, and that in practice the Church would  much prefer its parishioners to remain chaste. People will always have  sex with each other, but the Church’s disapproval of physical relations  has cast a veil of universal shame over the issue. This is particularly  the case for unmarried women; whereas Rozanov urges the Church to  accept illegitimate children, instead social stigmas encourage women  to hide them away or, even worse, to murder them. Rozanov takes  this further and reproaches the Church for condemning all forms of  creativity, especially literary.26 The necessity of sexual activity for Rozanov is tied to the concept of  the family. The family provides the basis for man’s religious activity,  and family life is the ideal condition of human existence as decreed by  God in Genesis. The family is ‘the step upwards to God’.27 Family ties  mediate between history and the origins of humanity, and preserve  and ensure the connection between God and the Earth through man’s  activity.28 Rozanov started to examine the Russian family in depth around the  end of the nineteenth century. His 1901 book, V mire neiasnogo i nereshen- nogo, investigated the religious philosophy of the family, in particular  the reverence for the family in what he considers its pre-Christian form.  This was followed by his 1903 work, Semeinyi vopros v Rossii, which  examined the practical consequences of the neglect of family values in  Russia. It examines Rozanov’s theme that childbirth is a re-enactment  of the Creation, and also looks in depth at the forms of worship,  25 V. V.

He refers to the etymology of the word ‘cosmos’, deriving from the ancient  Greek for ‘to make beautiful’. He understands the cosmos as the result of God’s creative  energy, to which man is called upon to respond with his own creative forces. 26 V. V.

This might appear contradictory in a thinker who valued  marriage. However, Rozanov’s attachment to beginnings allows for a  great deal of dynamism in his thought. Following Leont ́ev, Rozanov  takes an organic view of culture, and to all living phenomena. How- ever, where Leont ́ev’s view is for Rozanov highly pessimistic, with a  focus on decay, Rozanov modifies this by arguing for the possibility of  rebirth: all disintegration contains the potential for new life.30 Rozanov  applies this to matters of divorce. Love between spouses blossoms and  fades; he says that in their lifetime people usually love at least two  or three times, and only very rarely once.31 Hence people should be  allowed to consummate, dissolve, and enter into new marriages freely.  Divorce does not weaken the family unit, but actually strengthens it.  ‘Divorce is the pathway through which we cleanse our most important  social institution.’32 However, the Church refused to grant him a  divorce from his first wife, and he had to enter into an essentially  bigamous relationship with his second wife, Varvara Rudneva.  Their marriage was consecrated unofficially in a secret service by a  complicit priest in a locked church. Whereas the birth of any child is a holy act for Rozanov, he was  deeply distressed by the fact that the Church and the state refused  formally to recognize his paternity of his children with Rudneva.  However, it is important to note that Rozanov’s investigation into the  Russian family was not just a matter of personal concern. He cor- responded with and supported many ordinary Russians across the  country regarding their family problems, including people who had  been ostracized for finding new love in extra-marital relations. He also  petitioned the Church and the state, with eventual success, to reform  divorce laws. Of all his peers, in a philosophical environment obsessed  with finding viable answers to matters of faith, Rozanov was one of  29 V. V.

He understands the Church as naturally constituted by the body of the  Russian people; just as all Russians are innately members of this body,  as linked by their common biology, it is impossible for a non-Russian  to be a member of their Church. It is also impossible for Russians  to be excommunicated from the Church. Here Rozanov is close to a  strong tradition in Russia, still strong within the Orthodox Church  today, that does not differentiate between Russianness and Orthodoxy.  Rozanov is also close to the traditions of the pochvenniki, who identified  the organic concept of the Russian people as the locus for a national  religion. He also shares the pochvenniki’s opposition to the common  Slavophile view that the Orthodox Church as an institution naturally  expresses a doctrinal truth. However, Rozanov always considered him- self a faithful member of the Church. There is no sense that Rozanov  wants to demolish the Church; rather, he posits an engagement  from within, an attack on a ecclesiastical leadership which he believes  has lost its way and is in need of restoration. This is very much a  downward-up approach, launched in the name of the people; it is  worth noting Rozanov’s deep affection for individual priests, Orthodox  church buildings and Orthodoxy’s rites and rituals.34 Rozanov is concerned about the eschatological nature of Russian  philosophy, which has emerged from Orthodoxy. Despite his apprecia- tion of the manner of his rival’s engagement with Russian religious  traditions, Rozanov is critical of the eschatological aspects adopted by  Solov ́ev.35 Solov ́ev’s Christianity is focused on the ‘absolute promise’  of the eventual Kingdom of God, guaranteed by Christ’s death and  Resurrection.36 Rozanov picks up on Solov ́ev’s focus on the  Apocalypse, which is a subject to which he returns throughout his  33 See Tat ́iana Rozanova, Bud ́te svetly dukhom (Vospominaniia o V. V. Rozanove), ed. A. N.  Bogoslovskii, Moscow, 1999, p. 71. 34 Tareev, one of Rozanov’s most astute critics, notes Rozanov’s complex attitude to  Orthodoxy: ‘A serving priest, dressed in chasuble, is necessarily his enemy, but the very  same priest, as a family man, would inevitably be his friend.’ See Tareev, ‘V. V. Rozanov’,  p. 53. 35 Russian scholars have examined the relationship between Rozanov and Solov ́ev,  though this is an important area of study which requires more attention, especially in the  West. Most existing Russian scholarship centres on the two men’s arguments over religious  freedom. See, for example, Valerii Fateev, S russkoi bezdnoi v dushe: Zhizneopisanie Vasiliia  Rozanova, Kostroma, 2001, pp. 262–67. In these pages, Fateev also discusses at length the  arguments between the two men over the nature of the Apocalypse. Despite this focus in  scholarship, however, Rozanov believes that his polemics with Solov ́ev originated in their  opposing appraisals of Pushkin. V. V.

However, Rozanov, having known Solov ́ev himself,  is keenly interested in Solov ́ev’s personality. Rozanov considers  Solov ́ev a cold, ghostlike figure who was obsessed with the Antichrist  and an inescapable ‘supernatural’ sadness.39 He argues, therefore, that  Solov ́ev was unable to formulate a coherent philosophy of love that  validates physical existence: he had no family, no children, and no real  home.40 More critically, Rozanov cites Solov ́ev as the main culprit for  promoting eschatological trends throughout Russian culture, despite  his contribution to the development of Russian philosophy.41 Rozanov  concludes that the followers of Solov ́ev — especially Merezhkovskii  and Filosofov — will be intrinsically eschatological and anti- Russian.42 III Rozanov’s attention to beginnings and restarts helps him pry at the  division between Judaism and Christianity. He displays no particular  love for the Jewish people per se, and this remains consistent  throughout his career. This is an unfortunately common factor in  37 V. V. Rozanov, ‘Chto protiv printsipa tvorcheskoi svobody nashlis ́ vozrazit ́ zashchit- niki svobody khaoticheskoi’, in Russkaia mysl ́, Moscow, 2006, pp. 387–421 (p. 390). 38 V. V. Rozanov, ‘Iz starykh pisem. Pis ́ma Vlad. Serg. Solov ́eva’, in ibid., pp. 444–81  (p. 455). 39 Rozanov writes about Solov ́ev’s inability to love in many places, but perhaps one of  the most prominent instances where he links Solov ́ev’s lack of roots with his coldness to  other people is to be found in V. V. Rozanov, ‘Avtoportret Vl. S. Solov ́eva: Tserkovnye  zaniatiia ego i ego lichnost ́’, in Okolo narodnoi dushi, pp. 392–99 (p. 398). 40 Ibid. Rozanov was astonished that the ascetic Vladimir Solov ́ev could emerge  from such a productive figure as his father Sergei, who was a true family man with many  children. Rozanov writes that ‘the philosopher Solov ́ev is the living and personal negation  of the historian Solov ́ev’. From this one could even suggest that Rozanov is using the  Solov ́ev family as a demonstration of the manner in which an over-emphasis on philoso- phy has destroyed simple family life in Russia. V.

Rozanov expresses  his admiration for aspects of Jewish religious behaviour, in particular  the way it has preserved what he sees as a reverence for the Old  Testament in a contemporary setting; however, this is more a study of  religious practices rather than an expression of affection towards Jewish  people themselves, and Rozanov’s interest with the Jewish proximity to  the beginning of the world is often manifested as an acute envy.43 The complexity of Rozanov’s attitude towards Christianity stems  from his belief that religion is a natural and physical response to  Creation, rather than the product of its formal institutions. The central  aspect of this is childbirth which, Rozanov states, repeats the Creation  of the Earth, and through which humanity is saved. Pre-Christian  peoples, especially the ancient Egyptians (he often speaks in this context  of the ‘Egyptian Church’), have possessed Divine truths without  recourse to Christ.44 Therefore the Russians’ decision to adopt  Orthodox Christianity as a means to express their religiosity is an area  of concern for him. Rozanov rues the fact that Russia adopted the  Byzantine version of Christianity (he often expresses an admiration for  Western forms of Christianity which permit a greater attachment to  earthly affairs). In a call to the Russian Church’s leadership, Rozanov  draws up a list of questions which the clergy should answer, the most  important of which being why the Church has rejected the Creation  and the joys of the Old Testament in favour of the ‘tearful pietism’ and  apocalyptic fervour of the New Testament.45 He calls upon the Church  to renew its relationship to the Old Testament as a first step in its  renewed engagement with Russian society. However, throughout this period in question, Rozanov shifts the  focus of his attention from the doctrines and teachings of the Orthodox  Church to the figure of Jesus Christ Himself. Rozanov relies purely on  a relationship with the Father, omitting the role of the Second Person  of the Trinity. This has important consequences for the way Rozanov  attempts to reform Christianity. For Christians, salvation is contingent  43 Mondry picks up on Rozanov’s envy of the Jews’ privileged position in world history.  See Genrietta Mondri, ‘Vasilii Rozanov, evrei i russkaia literatura’, in Efim Kurganov  and Genrietta Mondri, Rozanov i evrei, St Petersburg, 2000, pp. 155–267 (p. 159). However,  Rozanov’s fascination with the Jewish people stems predominantly from their historical  exposure to the religion of the ancient Egyptians, who Rozanov claims were the only  people fully to understand the Creation. His later open animosity towards the Jewish  community stems from this fascination, and his eventual conclusion that the Jews abused  the truths gathered taken from the Egyptians. This area requires much more scholarly  attention. See Rozanov’s foreword to Iz vostochnykh motivov, reprinted in V. V. Rozanov,  ‘Predislovie’, in Vozrozhdaiushchiisia Egipet, ed. A. N. Nikoliukin, Moscow, 1999, p. 7. 44 Berdiaev termed Rozanov a ‘Christian without Christ’. N. A.

It becomes clear that Rozanov’s attempt to reform Russian  Orthodoxy is not an esoteric desire but a distinct way of approaching  a common project, that is the renegotiation of the relationship between  Russian Christianity and contemporary civilization. One of the main  inspirations behind this was Bukharev, and many of Rozanov’s peers  struggled to find a new dialogue between religious discourse and  culture.47 For Rozanov, it is of paramount importance that the Church  re-engage with Russian society, and his project largely involves search- ing for a common cultural origin to religion and civilization. Like many  of his peers, and inspired directly by Bukharev, Rozanov believes that  Christianity could not hide behind monastery walls but must re-involve  itself in all aspects of Russian life, including art, politics and social  affairs. For this reason, Rozanov often speaks approvingly of the  European Renaissance, an interest he shared with Florenskii, as this  was a time when he believes humanity re-evaluated its relationship with  elements of pre-Christian religions, and drew on aspects of its practical  endeavours, including the arts and sciences. The question of Christ and culture, so crucial at this period not just  in Russia but across European philosophy, is examined closely in a  1907 lecture, delivered to the Religious-Philosophical Society, entitled  ‘O Sladchaishem Iisuse i gor ́kikh plodakh mira’ (‘On the Sweetest  Jesus and the Bitter Fruits of the World’). In this talk, Rozanov  also expands on the consequences of Christ’s unearthly nature for  Christianity and Russian civilization more widely. Rozanov engages  with one of the most prominent themes in the thought of his contem- porary Merezhkovskii, that is the project to reconcile the teachings of  Christianity with modern Russian culture, and to bring about a form  of religion which is relevant to the everyday.48 46 The divinity of Christ, and His identity with God as the second Person of the Trinity,  was formalized at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, which remains the basis for Orthodox  Christology to this day, which agreed that Jesus was ‘one and the same Christ, Son, Lord,  only-begotten, acknowledged in two natures which undergo no confusion, no change, no  division, no separation; at no point was the difference between the natures taken away  through the union, but rather the property of both natures is preserved and comes  together into a single person and a single subsistent being; he is not parted or divided into  two persons, but is one and the same only-begotten Son, God, Word, Lord Jesus Christ’.  The Encyclopedia of Christianity, p. 399. 47 A useful examination of this is provided by Paul Valliere in ‘The Theology of Culture  in Late Imperial Russia’, in Sacred Stories: Religion and Spirituality in Modern Russia, ed. Mark  D. Steinberg and Heather J. Coleman, Bloomington, IN, 2007, pp. 377–95. 48 Unlike Rozanov, Merezhkovskii was intent on developing a new religion from a  synthesis of paganism and Christianity, into a third age of man’s religiosity, which would  ‘united heaven and earth’. See, for example, D. S. Merezhkovskii, Ne mir, no mech: K  budushchei kritike khristianstva, St Petersburg, 1908, p. 39. </page> <page sequence="15"> 238 rozanov  and  the  creat ion The Religious-Philosophical Society, and in its earlier guise as  the Religious-Philosophical Meetings, was a specific forum in which  Russian religious thinkers took it upon themselves to overcome the  divisions between Russian society and the Church. Rozanov was a  prominent advocate in promoting Russian thought as an expression  of popular will, not as the esoteric speculation of an elistist group.  However, the foundation of the Religious-Philosophical Society also  required a new type of engagement between Russian philosophy and  Orthodoxy. Many thinkers were deeply concerned over their growing  alienation from the Church; Gippius famously wrote that an ‘iron cur- tain’ had descended between Russian thought and the Church, which  divided Nevskii Prospekt at the Nikolaevskii railway station and cut off  the two groups from each other.49 However, dialogue between religious  thinkers and the clergy, which the state tolerated only semi-officially  and soon closed down, only served to highlight the differences between  formal Orthodoxy and speculative religious thought. The Church sees  a large proportion of its earthly task as essentially completed, in some  ways denying a soteriological meaning to earthly history; all its teach- ings and dogma, including the Liturgy, have already been given through  God and Christ and do not require addition or alteration. Therefore  the Church leans towards a separation of divine and earthly history,  which is one of the key points of investigation in the traditions of  Russian religious thought.50 For Rozanov and many of his coevals, including Merezhkovskii, the  idea of history and culture are closely linked, and yet Rozanov rejects  his peers’ attempts to re-examine the New Testament as the basis for  contemporary civilization. Although one of the senior members of the  Religious-Philosophical Society, Rozanov had his own specific agenda,  49 Z. N. Gippius, ‘Zadumchivyi strannik: O Rozanove’, in Vasilii Rozanov: pro et contra, 2,  pp. 143–85 (p. 153). 50 Kuznetsov argues that the apophatic traditions of Russian Orthodoxy, inherited from  the Greeks, have encouraged this distinction of history from eschatology. See P. Kuznetsov,  ‘Metafizicheskii Nartsiss i russkoe molchanie: P. Ia. Chaadaev i sud ́ba filosofii v Rossii’, in  P. Ia. Chaadaev: pro et contra. Lichnost ́ i tvorchestvo Petra Chaadaeva v otsenke russkikh myslitelei i  issledovatelei, ed. A. A. Ermichev and A. A. Zlatopol ́skaia, St Petersburg, 1998, pp. 729–52  (p. 730). Robin Aizlewood has also investigated this point in his study of the tensions  between ontological and rational concepts of truth in Russian thought, and writes: ‘earthly  historical existence is viewed as essentially already completed, and so in inheriting  this tradition Russian consciousness finds itself in a position of extra-historical existence’  (‘Revisiting Russian Identity in Russian Thought: From Chaadaev to the Early Twentieth  Century’, Slavonic and East European Review, 78, 2000, 1, pp. 20–43 [p. 23]). Many Russian  thinkers, including Rozanov and Berdiaev, engaged with the apophaticism prevalent in  Orthodoxy, arguing that a teaching that God in His essence is entirely distinct from this  world would lead to atheism. This argument has been picked up more recently in Mikhail  Epstein, ‘Post-Atheism: From Apophatic Theology to “Minimal Religion”’, in Mikhail  Epstein, Alexander Genis and Slobodanka Vladiv-Glover, Russian Postmodernism: New  Per spectives on Post-Soviet Culture, ed. and trans. Slobodanka Vladiv-Glover, Oxford, 1999,  pp. 345–93. </page> <page sequence="16"> adam  ure 239 which was to encourage both the Church and philosophers to recon- sider the Old Testament. Rozanov engages with Merezhkovskii’s  argument that the Gospel can be considered cultural in terms of  its relevance to contemporary society. Turning against the Church’s  neglect of the start of the Bible, and looking specifically to Russian  literature as a means for spiritual renewal, Rozanov rejects Merezh- kovskii’s claim that Russia’s clergy and her writers could ‘sit harmoni- ously around the same table, conduct pleasant conversations and drink  the same, tasty, tea’. Instead, Rozanov writes that it is impossible to  insert a piece of Gogol ́ into any of the Gospels or Epistles of the New  Testament.51 Rozanov expands on the division between the Church  and society; he writes that those who engage in cultural activities  cannot find a place in the church, and that the clergy refuse to engage  with contemporary civilization. Priests do not visit the theatre, and  avoid reading literary works. In what Rozanov considers a perversion  of the harmony of the spiritual and the physical, he notes that priests  seek physical discomfort, as they believe that any earthly joys are sinful:  he writes that priests are allowed jam, but it is much better if the jam  is sour.52 Rozanov uses the transformation of Saul of Tarsus into the Apostle  Paul to explain further the fractious relationship between the ancient  world and Orthodoxy. He writes that there was no gradual, organic  transition from one to the other, but instead a sudden and violent  change which does not allow for harmony. As soon as Saul became  Paul, he stopped going to the theatre. Paul never suggested that the  Athenians continue to visit the Olympic Games; instead of the har- mony of the ancient world and Christianity, posited by Merezhkovskii,  Rozanov argues that Saul and Paul ‘devour each other’s “self”’.53  Throughout his career, Rozanov is fascinated with St Paul’s writings  and his transformation of ancient religious practices. Rozanov criti- cizes the New Testament for not being an ‘earthly book’. There is also  a certain amount of sadness Rozanov sees in the New Testament,  which he often opposes with the family-based pleasures, as Rozanov  sees them, in the Old Testament. Rozanov insists that all religious  activity must be enjoyable, and based in reference to earthly joys.54  51 Rozanov, ‘O Sladchaishem Iisuse’, p. 418. 52 Ibid., pp. 419. 53 Ibid., pp. 418–19. 54 The issue of harmony between spiritual and terrestrial to which Rozanov strives has  been questioned. Filosofov argues that Rozanov was unable to find an answer to the pro- blem of the opposition he sets up between Christ and the world. D. V. Filosofov, ‘Rets.:  V. V. Rozanov, “Okolo tserkovnykh sten”, TT. I i II, SPb., 1905–1906’, in Vasilii Rozanov:  pro et contra, 2, pp. 5–15 (p. 15). Nosov comments that, far from realizing a unity of Heaven  and Earth within his own activity, Rozanov’s person was disrupted by his overbearing  attraction to the world. See Sergei Nosov, V. V. Rozanov: Estetika svobody, St Petersburg, 1993,  p. 9. </page> <page sequence="17"> 240 rozanov  and  the  creat ion ‘There is no laughter, no sexual love in the Gospels, and one drop of  either would burn all the pages of that wondrous book to ashes, would  “tear asunder the curtain” of Christianity.’55 The Church’s refusal to accept contemporary culture has widened  the division between man and God. The Gospels contain joys unre- lated to this world, which exist only at an ‘immeasurable height above  the Earth and humanity’.56 Rozanov argues that the Church encour- ages an exclusive focus on the spiritual side of religion, which results in  the clear separation of religious affairs from the physical reality expe- rienced by man. Once people are preoccupied with spiritual affairs, he  writes, then they lose the taste for this world; he asks, ‘who reaches for  potatoes after they have eaten pineapple?’57 Rozanov believes that St  Paul’s teachings leave all matter dead and detached from the divine.  Here Rozanov diverts most noticeably from Solov ́ev, who found in  Pauline doctrine a new means of rethinking Christianity’s relationship  to the modern world. Rozanov goes further. The New Testament is pessimistic, because  its central figure, Jesus Christ, is devoid of the joys of this world.  Rozanov points out that Christ never smiles (a question which has  occupied generations of theologians).58 Christ’s ‘sweetness’ is a sign  of his overpowering spiritual beauty, which is incompatible with  this world, and which has made the fruits of the Earth bitter by  comparison. Jesus is definitely more beautiful than anything on Earth and even more so  than the world itself. When He appeared, he, like the sun, obscured the  stars. We need stars at night. Stars are like art, science, the family.59 55 Rozanov, ‘O Sladchaishem Iisuse’, p. 419. Vliublennost ́ becomes a crucial term of  debate in this period among Rozanov and his opponents. Merezhkovskii and Gippius in  particular insist that vliublennost ́ only has validity in expressing how the flesh is transfigured  through sexual activity, whereas Rozanov rests on a core belief that the body is naturally  holy through its links to God the Father. 56 Ibid. 57 Ibid., p. 425. 58 The question of smiling and laughing in the Christian tradition has been widely  debated. Many theologians and religious philosophers have argued that laughter is  demonic, as Christ is never depicted in the Bible as smiling. However, there is a wider  association, with which Rozanov’s peers engaged, between laughter and earthly affairs;  matters of the spirit are separate from mirth. This is very important for Rozanov’s  appraisal of Orthodoxy as being a religion of sorrow, whereas he insists that humanity  should engage joyfully with the world. It is worth comparing Rozanov to Vladimir Solov ́ev’s  description of the human as a ‘laughing animal’; as Kostalevsky writes, Solov ́ev associates  laughter with man’s ability to elevate himself above the world and ‘regard it critically’.  Marina Kostalevsky, Dostoevsky and Soloviev: The Art of Integral Vision, New Haven, CT, 1997,  p. 59. In a similar vein, Averintsev sees Bakhtin’s use of laughter as an act of liberation  from affairs of this world. See Sergei Averintsev, ‘Bakhtin, Laughter and Christian Culture’,  in Bakhtin and Religion: A Feeling for Faith, ed. Susan M. Felch and Paul J. Contino, Evanston,  IL, 2001, pp. 79–96 (p. 80). 59 Rozanov, ‘O Sladchaishem Iisuse’, p. 425. </page> <page sequence="18"> adam  ure 241 In this essay, Rozanov also posits a close relationship between religious  and artistic activity, bound closely to themes of God the Creator as ‘the  supreme artist’. Rozanov rejects formal aesthetics in favour of a theory  of art which is based on the importance of family relations. Good art  should depict the simple pleasures of domestic life, and encourage its  reader to foster harmonious familial relations. Rozanov’s aesthetics are  essentially sexual (he is well aware of the Greek etymology of the word,  referring to physical contact), legitimizing sexual activity and persuad- ing its audience of the holiness of physical relations. One of the works  Rozanov cites approvingly in this lecture (although he confesses to not  having read it) is Renan’s Life of Jesus, which subverts the Gospel ideal  of spiritual worship by depicting the Apostles as married and in love  with their wives.60 Rozanov cannot, therefore, agree with Orthodox doctrine on the  consubstantiability of Christ, but rather argues that Christ and God are  in opposition to one another.61 He calls on the Church to acknowledge  the original sanctity of matter, which has its origin in the sexual creativ- ity of the First Person of the Trinity. Her writes: ‘The world is sacred  in the flesh, but sacred — not in the flesh of the Son, but sacred in its  procession from the flesh of the Father.’62 We note here Rozanov’s  deliberate manipulation of terms familiar to theologians. The ‘pro- cession’ is formally used to examine the relationship and dialogue of  the different persons of the Trinity, and here Rozanov contends that  Christ is a creation of God. Yet Christ’s teaching means that He (Christ)  cannot be reconciled with the Earth. Jesus demands that Christians  love only Him, and forsake this world. In turn, Jesus rejects the repro- ductive obligations placed on all creation, and disrupts the genealogical  ties between man and God. The Church has exacerbated the situation  by lapsing into crude anthropomorphism, depicting God as an old  man.63 Rather than an image of harmony with this Earth, Rozanov  presents Christ as being at war with the world, a battle which he  concludes Christ has won. Consequently, as Christ represents the next  world, His victory marks the victory of death over creation. 60 Ibid., p. 419. 61 Rozanov writes: ‘And Christ “ANTI-created the world”, and did not “CO-create the  world”. This is “the war on God”.’ V. V. Rozanov, Apokalipsis nashego vremeni, ed. A. N.  Nikoliukin, Moscow, 2000, p. 325. Rozanov reacts to Christ’s pernicious influence by  writing in a 1917 letter to his friend Gollerbakh, discussing the consequences of Christ’s  teachings for the family: ‘It was enough for him to dephallicize religion in order to destroy  religion completely, its very essence, its source, the Tree of Life (= the phallus) [. . .] in  order to conquer for ever the Phallus, and this — and only this — is the reason He came.’  Reprinted in V nashei smute, p. 348. Just as importantly for Rozanov, Christ destroys the  religious and cultural activity of literature, demonstrated by the fact that priests are not  allowed to read Gogol ́. 62 Rozanov, ‘O Sladchaishem Iisuse’, p. 422. 63 Ibid., p. 423. </page> <page sequence="19"> 242 rozanov  and  the  creat ion The main issue for Rozanov concerning Christ is that Rozanov is  focused firmly on God’s creative activity. He contends that ‘from  an Orthodox point of view activity is impossible’.64 Christ, who for  Rozanov is seedless and asexual, disrupts the divine activity on Earth  by refusing to perpetuate this creativity. Christ, who did not smile, did  not have children. Rozanov concludes that, whereas God is creative,  and sexual, Christ is celibate and seedless. Christ disrupts the genera- tion of new children and destroys the family by encouraging men to  leave their kin and to follow him: ‘Who so ever does not leave their father and mother for my sake’ — this  phrase, calling Nikanor and Filaret to their vow of chastity, which decided  the fate of Nekhliudov and Katerina’s ‘baby’, narrated in [Tolstoi’s] Resur- rection. Each call, each ideal is at the same time a repulsion, dissolution,  division; and the call to our children is a rejection of the family, is the dis- solution of the family: ‘In three days I shall bring down this temple’, ‘Verily,  verily: there will not be left here one stone upon another from these walls.’65 IV The traditions of Eastern Christianity have, despite the adoption of  Chalcedon (which was itself highly controversial and by no means  universally accepted), placed Christology firmly in the centre of discus- sions over how humanity is saved. The history of Orthodoxy is fraught  with debates and schisms over the nature of Christ and His place  within the Trinity. Orthodoxy distinguishes itself from Western  Christianity by stating that Christ alone cannot save man. One of the  principal (though by no means the only) causes for the schism between  the Western and Eastern Churches was the filioque controversy, the  Roman Church’s unilateral proclamation that the Holy Spirit proceeds  not only from the Father, but also from the Son, a declaration  unacceptable to the Orthodox. In the Western Church, believers tend  to formulate a much more personal relationship with Jesus, but in  Orthodoxy, Christ’s function is assured only through the Holy Spirit.  Christ could not incarnate and resurrect Himself; pneumatology  takes precedence over Christology.66 The Second Person alone is not  responsible for man’s salvation. This wariness of an over-reliance on Christ in the East appears  to have affected various arguments about His nature and role. For  example, the Arian controversy arose from the contention that Jesus  64 Ibid., p. 421. 65 V. V.

Rozanov can be contextualized  within the Eastern Christian traditions of subordinationism. His critics  accused him of Arianism.67 It is important for Rozanov to maintain  that Christ is created from God, and not consubstantial. The Incarna- tion of Christ, as promoted by the opponents of Arius and incorpo- rated into official Orthodox doctrine, implies the rejection of the Earth,  and places an obligation upon men to suffer. This is shown in  Victorinus’s treatise Against Arius. For this is a great mystery: that God ‘emptied Himself when he was in the  form of God,’ then that he suffered, first by being in the flesh and sharing  in the lot of human birth and being raised upon the Cross. These things,  however, would not be marvellous if he had come only from man or from  nothing, or from God by creation. For what would ‘he emptied himself’  mean if he did not exist before he was in the flesh? And what was he?  He said, ‘equal to God.’ But if he were created from nothing, how is he  equal?68 The uncertainty in the Orthodox tradition over Christ inevitably fed  into Russian religious philosophy. Rozanov was not alone among Silver  Age thinkers in questioning the importance of Christ’s activity. Many  of his peers saw Jesus as an unreliable guarantor of the communion  between the divine and human, and the historical doubts in Eastern  Christianity over the effectiveness of Christ’s economy may help  explain why many Russian philosophers modified their Christology.  Berdiaev noted that the God-Seekers had a poor relationship with the  Second Person of the Trinity.69 And here Berdiaev is not alone: the  accusation that Rozanov and his peers lacked a developed Christology  emerges elsewhere in critiques of Russian thought.70 The person of Jesus was the subject of wide-ranging speculation  among Rozanov’s peers, who modified or even rejected the traditional  Orthodox concepts of Christ. More sinister is a deep underlying  concern at this time of the personification of the opponent of God on  Earth, which appears to have been accepted as a real event. Rozanov’s  criticism of Christ for demanding that humans worship Him person- ally, when He in fact undoes God’s creativity, is mirrored, for example,  in the deliberately vague presentation of Dostoevskii’s Myshkin, or  in Merezhkovskii’s varying depiction of the Christ figure as a kind of  67 V.

Florovskii also attacks Florenskii for  bypassing the Incarnation and omitting Christology from his major work, Stolp i utverzhdenie  istiny.

Rival Christologies among Rozanov and his contemporaries fed into  different concepts of the body, an area which has become an important  topic of research.71 Crone in particular has examined the different  categories of holy flesh posited by figures such as Solov ́ev, Rozanov  and Berdiaev. Here it is helpful to unpack Orthodox doctrine over the  relationship of person and nature, which Rozanov does not examine in  depth but which may be inferred from his stance. Rozanov appears  to be pulling at the formal Orthodox division between biology and  personhood, for which the main inspiration was given by the Greek  Fathers and their anthropological separation of hypostasis and  substance (ousia). Zizioulas writes that ‘the ontological “principle” or  “cause” of being — i.e. that which makes a thing to exist — is not the  substance or nature but the person or hypostasis. Therefore being is  traced back not to substance but to person’.72 Similarly, Orthodoxy  sees the divine ‘ontological principle’ in the Personae of God, not in  their common nature. One can only assume that Rozanov wishes to reunite the concepts  of person and substance in his thought. This unity of personhood with  the material supports Rozanov’s backwards-looking religiosity, and  in particular his love for the elemental aspects of worship, which he  retains despite his rejection of the Christological reasoning behind such  things.73 Hence Rozanov’s approach to the Church can be broadly deter- mined as one of restoration, placing him in the context of a broader  Christian movement around the world at this time which looked to  revive supposed lost aspects of belief in contemporary worship. How- ever, Rozanov is consistent in his belief that humanity’s relationship  with the Divine has remained fundamentally unchanged since the  beginning of time, despite his acceptance of social and technological  progress. This puts him firmly in a particular strand of Russian  religious thought, populated by Strakhov, Rtsy and Sergei Sharapov,  where the core approach is to reconcile the foundations of their  religious outlook with contemporary life.74 71 For a historical overview of key positions on this, see Eric Naiman, Sex in Public:  The Incarnation of Early Soviet Ideology, Princeton, NJ, 1997, pp. 30–35. 72 Zizioulas, Being as Communion, pp. 38–42.

Nikoliukin, Moscow, 1999,  pp. 264–67 (p. 265). 74 It is at this point where Rozanov sometimes struggles to convince his readers of the  viability of his project. This was one of major critiques of Tareev, who accused Rozanov  in a letter of trying to find the universal mandates of Christianity in an idealized past:  ‘You want to turn the specific into the general, into the universal; you believe that what  happened in Babylon or Palestine happens now in the Russian countryside’.

Rozanov, drawing on  Hegel’s ideas, believes that artistic creativity is essentially a religious  act. He apparently told his friend Remizov that to write is to pray.75  Artistic endeavours also help underline the importance of the Creation.  Artistic output is essentially sexual.76 In this way, Rozanov’s renewal  of culture depends primarily on reclaiming what he sees to be an  intimately sensuous attitude to phenomena. This is ancient and at the  same time highly progressive: Culture begins where love begins, where affection is aroused; where the  human’s gaze, wandering about uncertainly, stops on something, and then  cannot leave it. Suddenly, once this happens, the external expression of  culture appears complex: new and unique feelings cancel out the former,  usual feelings.77 This view of culture as essentially cultish is very close to Florenskii’s,  and very different from Solov ́ev’s supernatural pessimism. In underlin- ing a specific type of relating to and experiencing of a phenomenon (in  Rozanov’s case based on the Creation and our initial encounter with  things), Rozanov also calls to mind some of the efforts of the Phenom- enologists (Husserl described himself as a ‘permanent beginner’). But  Rozanov’s approach to the world reveals the manner in which he  ‘thinks’. Rozanov’s ontology, and his reliance on the Creation as the  explanation for the relationship between God, the world and human- ity, informs his epistemology. Each encounter between a human and  the world is understood by Rozanov as in itself a repetition of the  Creation. This drives Rozanov to present as new ideas which might already  be present elsewhere. He approaches the work of his peers with a  somewhat cavalier attitude: Engelstein accuses him of ‘intellectual icon- oclasm’.78 It is not important for Rozanov whether his own ideas are  original. The vital aspect for him is that his thoughts are presented to  the reader each time as something entirely new. The critic Izmailov  notes that in over 800 pages, O ponimanii does not contain a single  reference to other people’s works.79 Yet, as Fediakin astutely notes, the  75 Aleksei Remizov, Kukkha: Rozanovy pis ́ma, New York, 1978, p. 59. 76 Towards the end of his life, Rozanov described how he wrote: ‘With a special feeling,  almost through my skin, I sense that “sweat left me”, and I grew tired — I glow and grow  tired — because “it was born”, “I gave birth”, because “semen left me”, and after this  I shall sleep until the next accumulation of semen.’ Poslednie list ́ia, p. 87. 77 V.

The contact replied that Rozanov arrived at the same conclusions as Hegel. The aca- demic concluded that it would have been of more benefit if Rozanov had simply learned  German instead. A. A.

Consequently, Rozanov is constantly searching to present existing ideas  and entities as new beginnings. This leads him to reject other thinkers’  philosophies: Rozanov even admits that he is filled with a longing  to ‘kill’ other people’s ideas.81 Despite his own creative approach to  religious affairs, it is dubious whether he permits others the same  freedom. Clearly, there are similarities between Rozanov’s approach and the  desire among the Russian Formalists to overcome an apparent stultifi- cation in Russian culture through art.82 Yet, whereas Shklovskii saw  Rozanov as opening a new literary genre, Rozanov was motivated by  his interest in pre-modern methods of thinking and writing. His focus  on the original and unique is evidenced in his love for hand-written  texts and his wariness of the printed word, as has been examined in  depth elsewhere.83 Although the ancient-as-modern motif was one of  the defining characteristics of his time, Rozanov’s fondness for the old  emerges from an affection for man’s pre-Christian history.84 In fact, as  Berdiaev notes, there is a sense that the general impatience among  Russian philosophers with the established Church, and the desire to  reform it, stems from their own eschatology.85 80 Fediakin writes, ‘If one tries to follow Rozanov’s path to Uedinennoe, then he starts, of  course, with his first book “O ponimanii”, where he appears in philosophy as some kind  of “Robinson Crusoe”, tackling anew the most difficult problems of philosophy, going past  the efforts of the majority of past and present philosophers (therefore we immediately notice  the absence of authoritative references, inferences which could help the philosopher to  solve any of these problems, Rozanov always tries to “reinvent the wheel”, i.e. to make his  own way through the path already plotted by world philosophy)’.

There is a tendency more generally for philosophy to be  associated with death and teleologies. Rozanov’s approach stands out  by its explicit rejection of eschatology and its probing at the meaning  of God’s fatherhood of humanity in a very direct sense. To this end,  Rozanov insists that the Russians should reject ‘the cult of the spirit’  which dominates the Church, and instead foster a ‘cult of the body’.86  In turn, Rozanov believes that culture, which is essentially cultish, must  be rooted in the body. The body is obviously the means by which the  human interacts with the material world, but for Rozanov is also the  locus for our relationship with God. Dogma must be connected somehow to faith, and faith must be  rooted in dogma. For Rozanov, culture opens up the reality of this  relationship, and is the defining link between them, as it enables the  core tenets of religion to be manifested in a multitude of everyday situ- ations. The words of the Bible lay out the obligation of man’s future  creativity. Rozanov’s vision of culture appears to have important con- sequences for the development of certain strands of Russian religious  thought. One is reminded of Florenskii’s ‘experiential dogmatics’, which  have been examined expertly by Valliere in his study of the way reli- gious thinkers sought to reconcile Orthodox teaching with the modern  world.87 Rozanov and Florenskii in fact belong to the tradition initi- ated by Chaadaev, that is the attempt to reconcile historical conscious- ness with the permeant tenets of Christianity. In this vein, Zen ́kovskii  sees Rozanov’s work as providing a crucial shift from rigid thought to  a more ontological expression of truth as manifested through the living  person.88 Rozanov had probed at the importance of an experiential  approach to the world in his very first work, but this approach is  fulfilled by his later, detailed investigations of the Bible, predominantly  the Old Testament. In this way, Rozanov ultimately justifies his own  approach, eventually providing in his final works a type of religious  writing which, centred on his own family life, is a true expression of his  demand to fulfil Scripture. This is the culmination of his peculiar con- cept of imitatio Dei, which rests on overcoming Christology, and return- ing to a type of religious behaviour which responds appropriately to  the Father and the Creation. 86 V.
