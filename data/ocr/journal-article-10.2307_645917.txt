<plain_text><page sequence="1">the sounds of silence: cross-world communication and the auditory arts in African societies PHILIP M. PEEK-Drew University A hunter found a human skull in the forest and asked, "What brought you here?" The skull answered. "Talking brought me here." The hunter ran and told the king that he had found a skull that talked. The king did not believe him and sent a guard to see if his story was true, with orders to kill him if it was not. All day long the hunter begged the skull to speak, but it remained silent and the hunter was killed. When the guard had left, the skull asked, "What brought you here?" The hunter's head replied, "Talking brought me here." [Bascom 1 977:274] Among the lessons to be learned from this tale, originally recorded among the Nupe of Nigeria by Frobenius, is the caution any scholar should exercise when commenting on human behavior, especially human speech. Talking about talking is tricky business. This tale also introduces the matter of speech (and silence) of beings of the otherworld. It reveals not simply the dangers of ill-considered talk among humans but the complexities and truly life-sustaining importance of cross-world communication. Underneath the story's humor is a critical reminder about such exchanges-perhaps it was not that the hunter spoke incorrectly, but that he heard the skull incorrectly. Communication with the otherworld is not only dependent on addressing one's message to the correct entity in the correct code but also on understanding the correct response, as African religious specialists and diviners are so acutely aware. By reviewing how the other world is made audible and what characterizes its sounds and speech, we begin to understand how fundamental the acoustic realm is to the maintenance of cultural norms and how it reinforces systems of meaning and signification within African cultures. No one would doubt the importance of the content of cross-world communication, so why is the means and manner of these messages so little studied? Given the importance African peoples place on the acoustic realm, surely study of cross-world communication and the auditory arts will reveal previously unheard dimensions of their cultures. In the above story, the skull, although a suprahuman entity, speaks in a recognizable voice; but such clarity of language, if not meaning, is not always the case. Certainly, beings of the otherworld do not always speak as we do. Is their speech animal-like, human-like, or like nothing ever heard before? Can they be heard at all or will their awesome difference be represented by silence? Are the sounds of "sent" prayers the same as "received" voices of spirit The prominence of the auditory world for African peoples requires attuning our study of their cultures more directly to the phenomena of sound. Cross-world communication, which establishes and validates the basis for human action, occurs when the normally inaudible otherworld beings reveal themselves in distinct acoustic fashion. This study reviews those otherworld voices, heard through divine kings and divination, and in the auditory arts of musical instruments, masquerades and narratives. Careful listening to African peoples' auditory arts reveals previously unheard dimensions of their cultures, how they acoustically manifest and validate the spirit world.

Throughout Africa, whatever the scheme employed, otherworldy presences or messages are always signaled by acoustic differences. The power of words and the primacy of auditory aspects of the world for so many African peoples recommends that we attune our study of African societies more directly to the phenomena of sound and "acoustic ecology" (Feld 1988:88). Speech among African peoples is not just aboutsomething, it is something (Peek 1981). Sound is not simply culturally patterned noise filling acoustic space. While African societies may not be any more polyphonic than others, they seem especially sensitive to their rich soundscapes. And in their auditory arts' there is continual practice of an acoustic alchemy akin to the visual bricolage we have come to appreciate in so many African visual arts. Not unexpectedly, given our scholarship's visual bias, we know far more about how otherworld beings appear than how they sound. We have studied how African peoples make visible the (normally) invisible, but not how the inaudible is made audible. Although African societies thrive in a world full of sounds-of conversation and verbal art, of song and music-the scholarship about their cultures is strangely quiet. The continent of Africa may no longer be "dark," but it is still "silent" due to the relative deafness of Africanist scholars. Coupling the centrality of the auditory with the indisputable importance of the ancestors and spiritual beings, we must then come to a better understanding of the nature of otherworld sounds in African cultures. "Spirit speech," the "sounds of silence," is essential to this world, for it establishes the foundation upon which meaning is made. Such speech constitutes and reaffirms a worldview because it reassures us that the ancestors and spirits have not forsaken us. The following discussion will attempt a preliminary review of what is known about the acoustic presentation of the otherworld among African peoples. A complete statement about a continent of thousands of diverse cultures is not possible, but the evidence presented and questions raised do demonstrate an extraordinarily rich area to investigate further. Full ethnographies of sound comparable to studies elsewhere are rare in African scholarship. For example, Sullivan's (1899) magisterial survey of religious systems of South American cultures, Icanchu's Drum, where the association of sound with all dimensions of various cultural systems is demonstrated in exciting detail, has no parallel in African scholarship.2 An initial review of the study of human phonation reveals fragments here and there that should have been "heard" and responded to long ago. The concept of acoustic or auditory space was first raised years ago.3 Perhaps Levi-Strauss's dedication of The Raw and the Cooked (1969) "To Music" and the orchestrated chapter titles seemed too much of a conceit, but his subtle and insightful analyses (see especially 1969, 1973, and 1981) of the correlations of sound and social systems should have been pursued. Needham (1967) provided a valuable discussion on percussion and rites of transition which A. Jackson (1968) ably extended to sound and ritual in general. Consistent application of the analytic categories of the communication event as established by Hymes (see, for example, 1974) and others would also reveal the essential auditory elements.4 There are, in fact, a few studies of African peoples that indicate how fundamental not just human speech but aurality in general is in human existence. In concluding a fascinating essay, "Aurality and Consciousness: Basotho Production of Significance," Charles Adams writes: The tenet of Basotho culture exhibited in their domain of activities called "games" [a wide range of expressive behaviors], and stated here as an "hypothesis" is that "aurality," sounding and hearing, is a necessary condition of becoming conscious and the principle mode for the production of significant interpretation of the circumstances of living. [1979:31 8] In a similar vein, Ritchie notes that, among the Hausa of northern Nigeria, "to hear" is "to know"; while our more familiar "to see" only refers to sight (1991:194). Both Adams and Ritchie stress the sounds of silence 475</page><page sequence="3">that these concepts do not intend an exclusive primacy of aural ity but that all else should be in congruence with aurality. While aurality is central, ultimately, knowledge has a multisensory foundation because experience itself is multisensory. Especially in communication between worlds, there is a need to investigate the full human sensorium and all modes by which humans interact and make meaning. The rewards of such reorientation are amply demonstrated in The Varieties of Sensory Experience (1991 ), edited by David Howes. While we expand our study of expressive behavior beyond the visual, we must also anticipate differing cultural foci for the senses. Wober (1966) alerted us to the probability of varying cultural "sensotypes" which might accent, for example, auditory analytical skills over proprioceptive or visual abilities within a society. Defining features of sacred communication will differ by culture (smell, visual appearance, sounds, and so on), but all are experienced simultaneously. Therefore, the full cultural sensorium must be studied, and we shou Id expect correlations of sensory systems and conscious synesthesia rather than rigid separation of sensory realms. For example, Feld writes about the "spatial-acoustic metaphor, a visual image set in sonic form and a sonic form set in visual imagery" (1988:78). Sound brings forth visual images just as sight brings forth sonic images. Scholars are beginning to respond to the multimodal presentation of knowledge in African cultures. Such synesthesia is demonstrated by visual restatements of acoustic associations in the forms and decorations of African musical instruments (Brincard 1989). Brett-Smith (1984) raises this point in her investi- gation of the "esthetic of the irregular," which affects both the visual and auditory arts of the Bamana of Mali. As a number of linguists and philosophers have noted, the auditory world is all-encompass- ing-its simultaneity surrounds us, while the visual is sequential. The visual is spatially bounded; sound is virtually limitless. "Auditory space has no favoured focus. It's a sphere without fixed boundaries, space made by the thing itself, not space containing the thing" (Carpenter et al. 1964). This provides a valuable congruence of perspectives, since contemporary ethnographic studies of African cultures deny a rigid separation of the sacred and secular, this world and the otherworld. For many African peoples, the secular and sacred "worlds" are but realms of a single, though not completely known, universe. The use of boundless sound as a primary means of interaction between worlds is thus totally appropriate. Although sound may be conceived of as boundless in spatial terms, it is nevertheless limited by duration (as is smell). This reminds us that sacred speech, music, and so on are often rigidly proscribed in time. Thus, there are ultimately cultural and physical boundaries for sound. Nevertheless, the utterance or perform- ance of sounds linked to primordial events transcends space and transports the hearers to that earlier time. The auditory not only exists in time but can alter time. Cross-world communication occurs within basic epistemological contrasts of silence, sound, and noise made by African peoples. In Morocco, "while words and confident noise belong to the human world, 'odd' sounds such as whistling and humming are thought to be the talk of jinn" (Griffin 1991:216). The Lele of Zaire distinguish day and night human noises, to which the spirits will and will not respond, especially on days of religious activity: "The spirits were then abroad in daylight as if it were night, so no workaday noise of pounding or chopping is allowed; but this is the only day when the drums may be beaten in full daylight, and everyone dances" (Douglas 1963:12). Merriam (1964:64-66) reports that the Basongye distinguish music from noise as being organized sound with continuity over time that is produced by humans. The Dogon separate human speech and instruments' voices from noise, which lacks meaning and harmony (Calame-Griau le 1986:3-4). In Wayward Servants, Turnbull (1965) treats in much detail the Mbuti distinctions of quiet and silence, sound and noise. Their typology, formed in the context of the more audible than visible forest, values quiet (but not silence) and sound (but not noise). 476 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="4">Zahan takes matters much further as he analyzes the meaning of silence among the Bamana for whom "silence is not an absence, still less a lack, but a present reality." Ontologically, they relate speech and silence: while speech is the child of silence, the former engenders the latter. "For this reason, the Bambara [Bamana] affirm that speech and discourse-language-only acquire their full value in relation to the silence which underlies them" (1979:117). Zahan concludes: "Thus emerges, according to Bambara [Bamana] thought, the true nature of silence. It is tied to life; it is a source of life since it leads to the conservation of existence which it otherwise protects" (1979:119).5 Clearly we must pay more attention to the acoustics of African worlds, their sounds and silences, as well as the elaborate alterations (including denial) of human speech. A striking variety of instances among African cultures demonstrates that the speech of spirits and suprahuman forces necessitates special knowledge and devices to be received, translated, and interpreted properly. Thus, hearing, not just speaking, is critical, as Yankah (1985) stresses in his discussion of "aural literature." After considering the dynamics of the intermediary roles of divine kings, diviners, and spirit mediums, we will review the sounds of the otherworld as manifest in the auditory arts of musical instruments, masquerades, and narratives. the silence of divine kings Among the unique humans who stand between worlds and whose mode of communication is significant is the divine king. This institution is found throughout sub-Saharan Africa, although the auditory arts of separation (distinguishing commoner from royalty) have been modified in recent times. The oba (king) of the Benin Kingdom in Nigeria, formerly restricted to the palace, was seldom seen and even less seldom heard in public. Others spoke for or as the oba. In fact, his public voice, as that of the supreme ruler of this world and as an audio embodiment of the spirit world, was associated primarily with the uttering of curses or death sentences, the ultimate expression of supreme authority (P. Ben-Amos 1980:68). Restrictions of the divine king's voice and the imposition of silence can be understood in several ways. As a divine presence in this world, how terrible and fearsome must a king's voice be? What would happen were he to attempt to converse as a mere mortal? Surely his voice's power is evident, if its utterance is the condemnation of a human to death. Perhaps it is that the divine king is not just silent but has been silenced for the protection of all. Other perspectives seem to be involved. The denial of human speech is a fundamental denial of humanness. The presence or absence of intelligible human speech is the initial marker of those beings or animals who are or are not like us. What more dramatic means of separating the king from commoners than to maintain a difference in speech? Not only is human speech negated, but the exchange of speech-the vocal interaction that is human interaction-is denied. Thus, a divine king's muteness is an immediate and fundamental indication of his otherworldliness. Perhaps, as we find with diviner's and others who serve this world by speaking for and with the otherworld, we could not understand a king's speech even if we heard it. Just as spirits do not sound like humans, a divine king will sound differently. Therefore, there are those who speak for and as the king. The Akan okyeame, official "linguist" of kings and chiefs, is an immediate example, although Cole and Ross found this role to be more that of a chancellor and only secondarily an intermediary and elaborator of the king's words (1977:158-160). Finnegan adds that such spokesmen provide an "extra authority of remoteness" for the king's utterances (1970:447). Nevertheless, a broader pattern seems to prevail in West Africa, as I have discussed elsewhere (Peek 1981), in which a king's spokesman does not simply "stand in" for a king to relieve him of burdensome tasks. To speak "as the king" is to be the king sonically. These speech surrogates are essential, for without them the king would be silent, as would the ancestors and spirit beings without the diviner. Such traditional roles may no longer be enacted the sounds of silence 477</page><page sequence="5">totally, but the presence of spokesmen in contemporary African courts demonstrates continued differentiation of the divine king's voice from others. There may be another dimension to the denial of the king's voice. If, as seems to be the case, words among African peoples do have illocutionary force, then their denial may serve to underscore their power. Just as one heightens sexual potency by its denial through sexual abstinence, so one may use silence as a means of retaining the force of human speech. To be silent is to be chaste; to not speak is to reserve the fearsome potentiality of "the word." One's individual essences are protected and strengthened by restraint from speech as well as by denial of sexual intercourse. Silence has further connotations of power. To be silent is to be secretive. This may be understood as wisdom or witchcraft. The potency of human silence again comes to the fore. True knowledge is secret-the more secret, the more powerful. Thus, a divine king, who is wisest of all, will be the most secretive, the most silent. This is a silence that also portends the presence of something mighty and awesome. An associated perspective must be noted. All African peoples value the one who speaks well, who speaks wisely, fully, and coolly. For example, the Gbeya of the Central African Republic consider silence to have a protective function and assert that "speech, not silence, is what gets a person into trouble" (Samarin 1965:117,119). The less one speaks, the more respect one may receive. Among many societies, such as the Bamana, silence is highly valued and demonstrates an individual's maturity and wisdom, as Zahan so well describes: It [silence] is the supreme virtue, as it subsumes integrity, courage, the power of the soul, prudence, modesty, and temperance. Silence defines the man of character, and is the attribute of the wise man; it is a type of wisdom. He who knows how to be silent possesses true happiness, interior peace, and detachment. [1979:113] How better to describe the exceptional character of a divine king? There are, of course, traditions everywhere of what cannot be said in certain situations, but prohibitions on speech seem far more exacting and strict in African societies.6 Rites of passage, most frequently burials and funerals, initiation ceremonies, and parts of the agricultural cycle, are marked off by restrictions on speech. There are also social contexts where the conscious avoidance of speech connotes a chastising response to a transgression. During discussions in Burundi, "a senior's silence effectively silences all his social inferiors" (Albert 1964:41). Clearly in oral-aural cultures where human speech has such importance, the choice notto speak carries a variety of messages. As we have encountered in relation to divine kings, several different codes of silence may be involved. We are reminded that, in silence, much is to be heard. Silence is not simply the absence of sound. The Kuranko of Sierra Leone even have an ideophone, "dondon,"which they use to indicate the presence of silence in narratives (M. Jackson 1982:64). The various possible interpretations of a divine king's silence also aid us to understand the ancestors' and spiritual beings' auditory natures.7 As well, attitudes toward the acoustic dimensions of divine kings indicate the dangers of cross-world communication. Certainly practices vary among different African cultures, but the restrictions on their speech can be informative of attitudes about verbal communication between this world and the other. The sounds and silences, the modifications of normal human vocal discourse, the acoustic potency of the divine king and diviner focus our attention on the importance of cross-world communi- cation. the hearing and speech of diviners and spirit mediums Above all else, religious specialists master sound; they alone can speak with and hear from animals, ancestors, and otherworld beings. As A. Jackson perceptively observed, "a deaf ritual specialist is an anomaly whereas a blind one is common enough" (1968:296). Ritual acts must 478 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="6">first establish grounds for dialogue: human and otherworldly beings must both hear and reply to each other. Ritual sound (voice, song, music) serves to sacralize space, being, and, above all, time in this world, in order to permit such dialogue. Not only do most rituals begin with sound, but the first evidence of spiritual attendance is usually auditory. Therefore, the utterance of prayers has acoustic significance because special sounds, not simply sacred texts and ritual behaviors, insure the prayers will be heard. In one of the few references found on this matter, Calame-Griaule reports that Dogon prayers are uttered in a rapid, high-pitched voice in order to compel the otherworld being's attention (1986:507). This is reminiscent of Tedlock's discussion of the Zuni prayer mode called "raising it right up" (1983:181). While prayer can appropriately be considered a form of auditory art, we can only recognize it here as yet another topic for further investigation. The diviner and spirit medium are at the crux of cross-world communication for African peoples. Spirit mediums may divine for followers and clients, but not all diviners become possessed by beings from the otherworld. Whatever the exact procedure, diviners underscore the essential point of this whole article. Although we think of the otherworld as being silent, it may be more profitable to understand the otherworld as broadcasting continuously. We know that our atmosphere is filled with radio and other waves of varying frequency, which are "silent" until we have the proper receiver tuned to the correct frequency. In similar fashion, diviners and spirit mediums are such receivers for their communities. African divination systems provide ready examples of highly charged interaction that demands specialist intermediaries to insure effective communication between different realms of the universe. Diviners act as mediators between worlds because the speech they hear and relate to their clients usually cannot be heard by average humans (and, if heard, could not be understood anyway). In many divining systems, the diviner is also the translator and interpreter. But, elsewhere, divining spirit mediums often speak with nonhuman voices (some snorting and growling, while others might be shrill and indistinct) or in esoteric languages and may not know themselves what has been transmitted. Their messages frequently need attendant specialists to translate them. These additional mediators (between diviner/medium and audience) perform a critical function, one that must be understood acoustically, for their role relates solely to sound and to no other factor. In the Sudan, the Atuot diviner has (as do others in eastern and southern Africa) a special assistant who "catches" the occult messages and translates them for the cl ients (Burton 1991). Other peoples utilize such official interlocutors as Galli (1983) found among the Anyi-Bona of Cote d'lvoire, where tale tellers as well as kings and public speakers must be accompanied by one who formally receives the word and passes it on to the audience.8 Unfortunately, the literature on African spirit mediums treats the contents but not the sounds of their occult messages. Beattie and Middleton's classic anthology (1969) on African spirit mediumship has very little on the qualities and powers of spirit speech, although Horton's article summarizes the most common explanations for the unintelligibility of spirit speech (1969:29). Mechanical divinatory instruments also generate obscure messages to be translated and interpreted. Among the Isoko and other peoples of southern Nigeria, the "reading" of the divining chains is done initially in an esoteric language, which is then translated into the local language (Peek 1982). Otherworldly communication received through divination, although intended for specific individuals, is seldom expressed explicitly in mundane human languages and therefore necessitates a specialist who can hear and transform the message correctly. Divinatory instruments are carefully prepared as well, so that they will "hear" the occult communication properly (Peek 1991). A common quality of religious specialists is their unique ability to hear otherworldly voices and significant sounds. While we may say that diviners see what the average person does not see-that they have "second sight" and enhanced perceptual abilities-in actual fact auditory abilities may be more critical. As noted earlier, seldom is a deaf religious specialist of any type the sounds of silence 479</page><page sequence="7">found, whereas blind religious specialists are frequent and especially important are "blind seers," diviners. Several basic matters are raised by African divination practices. Divinatory mechanisms and methods not only accomplish cross-world communication but do so in the most effective manner possible. Thus, the representations of occult sounds, voices, and languages cannot be understood as simply "ritual" but as means by which the inaudible becomes audible. Thus, the unknown has become knowable through hearing appropriate sounds correctly. musical instruments and sacred sound In addition to diviners and divine kings, there are others who provide acoustic manifestations of the otherworld. Before we turn to the auditory arts of African masquerades, the most familiar representation of spirit beings' sacred speech and sounds, we must consider the larger context in which masquerades occur. There is the whole performance complex of music, song, and dance, which constitutes a masquerade and may itself derive from the otherworld. Many peoples, for example in southern Nigeria, maintain that, frequently, the forms and contents of these arts originated with spirit beings-indeed, artistic creativity, in general, is often attributed to suprahuman sources. Merriam (1 964:74ff.) provides examples from throughout Africa of the otherworldly origins of music and individual musicians' songs. Although he was speaking of South American customs, it is interesting that Levi-Strauss once observed that "singing and musical instruments are often compared to masks; they are the acoustic equivalents of what actual masks represent on the plastic level" (1969:28). The use of "talking" instruments among African peoples and their relationship to tonal languages have long been noted. In addition to drums, there are slit gongs, ceramic pot resonators, water and earth-friction drums, whistles, and bull-roarers with which people "speak" and suprahuman beings are "heard." Such practices may simply illustrate that nonhuman entities do not speak or sound like humans, and, thus, instruments, most often percussive, are used to represent their sounds and speech. But are such musical instruments used differently when performing this communicative function? It seems that certain instruments in each culture are more commonly used for cross-world communication, but specifics are hard to find. Surely one of the most intriguing acoustic phenomena is the rock gong. Conant surveys the presence and uses of rock gongs in Africa and elsewhere. For the Barawa and Bankalawa of northern Nigeria, rock gongs are used as signaling devices and are "rung" during rituals as the "voice of dodo (generalized ancestors)" (Conant 1960:159). Such sounding of the earth itself certainly was an awesome acoustic representation of the otherworld. The ubiquitous bull-roarer (a rhomb that is swung in the air) certainly fits this special category of instruments restricted to cross-world communication, for it is never used in any other manner (and is always secreted from women). Among the Dogon, bull-roarers have extraordinary power: "The voice of the bull-roarer eats everything" (Calame-Griaule 1986:278, n.28). Three types are played in a set acoustic order, from deepest to highest sound. Each has cosmological associations as well; for example, the second, Calame-Griaule records, is "the Fox that the ancestor took by the tail and turned in the air" (1986:670). The Dogon fox has myriad complex associations with cross-world communication, especially in relation to divination and ancestral voices. This association of bull-roarers and ancestral voices occurs among the Yoruba as well. On the third day of funeral ceremonies, "opening the voice of the deceased" is performed with bull-roarers: "The new ancestor's voice will be heard for the first time. People say, 'Oro is crying.' " A detailed review of the use and meaning of bull-roarers in African societies is long overdue.9 The power of sacred sound, nonmusical and musical, as voices of the other world, is demonstrated among the Isoko of the northwestern Niger Delta in a variety of ways. Eri (spirits) 480 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="8">hear the priest's iron staff's "jang, jang, jang" when priests are walking or serving at the shrine. Priests initiate all services by shaking their awala (a special wooden rattle with seeds attached) to awake the deity. Some Isoko clans observe the annual Oworu festival very strictly, as in lyede where the tortoise shells that are beaten to accompany the masqueraders are restricted to an explicit period of the ceremonies. The full import of these regulations was most dramatically impressed upon me when I was prevented from replaying my tapes of Oworu music a few months after the festival had ended. Even discussion of the music was only hesitantly permitted. Again, we find attention paid primarily to the auditory realm and the rigidity of ritually bounded acoustic time frames. It did not matter where I played the tape but when I played it. Sacred sounds produced here are immediately heard there, and that was not the correct time. There is no question that otherworld inhabitants hear and respond to certain instrumental sounds. At another Isoko clan's annual festival, an enormous ogri drum must be beaten continuously for three days to honor the ancestors; thus, the community's nonnormal status is marked off acoustically so that the ancestors know when to return. This instance of ritual sound alerts us to another dimension of the auditory world. Sacred sound also serves to protect the people during ceremonies just as do the medicines placed at critical points in the village and worn by performers and ritual specialists. Often the presence of spirits is announced with special instruments, rhythms, or sounds, just as public outings of divine kings are preceded by special warning sounds. A ritual period or a sacred presence must be signaled sonically, just as physical space is marked off visually for ceremonies. A well-known characteristic of African musical instruments is that the clarity of their tones is purposely denied by the addition of attachments that "burr" the sound or add a secondary "buzzing" sound (Merriam 1965:75). Typically, we find this with the "thumb piano" (mbira or sanza), stringed instruments, and certain drum types. Again, we question the relationship of these augmented instruments to their role as voices for spirit beings.10 Lifschitz discusses this secondary, "buzzing" sound with examples from throughout Africa and concludes it is an ancient tradition most often associated with the ancestors' voices (1988:225-226). This suggests that the modification of instruments tones may be analogous to affectations of the human voice through nasalization and lisping, which are among the more common characteristics of "spirit voices." Could these similar alterations of vocal nasalization and instrumental "buzzing" be attempts to imitate the sounds of the near-dead (those closest to the otherworld)? Are these dry, rasping sounds those of the proverbial "death-rattle" of the dying person? Recalling the communicative aspects of the divine ruler, an obvious example of "talking" drums are the royal drums known for "speaking" the praises of the king or queen. In many African courts, these are highly sacred royal instruments, which "speak" only for or about the king or queen, and whose use is heavily restricted. Thompson aptly refers to such as "a chief's sounding image" (1989:44). Although much has been recorded about these instruments, such as Doob on Nkole royal drums (1966:284ff.),11 data and discussion usually focus on them as royal regalia rather than on the nature of the sounds and speech produced. Finnegan notes that among the Limba "gbin, gbin, gbin, gbin" represents the sound of a chief's drum (1967:80): but is this a different sound than that of a commoner's drum? There may be a relationship of royal instruments' voices and restrictions on divine rulers' public speaking. Surely when royal instruments are played, their sounds and not just their sources have special meaning to the people. Whether or not these sounds are sacred per se, their sonic (and thereby political) power is certainly greater than common instruments. As Chernoff (1979) and Yankah (1985) have argued, drum and other instrumental languages should be understood as distinct languages, not just speech surrogates. Therefore, within this context, we should compare "sacred" and "secular" sounds of speaking instruments. Most studies concentrate on the reduction of drum speech to written texts (Finnegan 1970; Sebeok the sounds of silence 481</page><page sequence="9">and Umiker-Sebeok 1976; Ong 1977:92-120), just as studies of verbal art tend to be studies of written translations rather than of spoken performances. The occasional direct comment on the meanings of instruments and their sounds among African peoples suggests that they are often associated with the voices of the ancestors and suprahuman beings. First of all, the materials used for musical instruments may be inhabited by nonhuman entities and already have special powers. For example, Nketia (1989:22) speaks of ceremonies preceding the cutting of a tree for a drum among Ghanaian peoples. Cole and Aniakor's discussion of the Nigerian Igbo ikoro (a large slit gong) reveals the seriousness with which these instruments are treated. Underscoring their association with warfare, the ikoro spirit that inhabits each of these elaborate slit gongs formerly demanded human sacrifices (1984:87- 88).12 To the west, the Isoko have similar traditions for their ogri drums, which are associated with the Igbu (the Warrior Society). Autoresonance is the ultimate attribution of otherworldly presence to musical instruments. The mbira musicians with whom Berliner worked understood their instruments to communicate with them during performances and dreams (1981:128-130, 138). Summarizing musicians' comments, Berliner writes: the music reflected back to him [musician] by his resonator as he plays seems to be more complex than that which his fingers alone produce.... It may well be that this feedback is responsible for some musicians' personification of the mbira and its role in the music-making process. [1981:130] Thompson notes that among the Kongo "there are many tales about voices in a drum, of drums covered with a special garment and left alone, who suddenly begin to vibrate of their own accord" (1989:44). Each Isoko clan deity's shrine has an usu staff, an iron rod with bell-like attachments, which will jangle when the edo (deity) is present at the shrine. The sonic manifestation of spiritual beings without human agency suggests that sound itself has force and presence and is made meaningfully audible through certain instruments, musicians, or social contexts. The anthropomorphization of musical instruments occurs in myriad ways, with instruments or their parts referred to in human body or kinship terms. Instruments, especially drum ensembles, may be referred to as father, mother, and children. The Shona extend such terminology to the mbira's individual keys (Berliner 1981). Also, instruments may be carved or decorated to represent the human body (Brincard 1989); but it should be stressed that the visual adornment is to augment and amplify the aural aspects, for the instrument's sound is still primary. Some musical instruments,.due to their unique qualities, literally embody cross-world communication as, for example, among the Dogon of Mali who directly link musical instru- ments and spiritual beings. Griaule was told by the sage Ogotemmeli that the first drum (a pressure drum) was made by the Nummo (primordial being)." 'His [Nummo's] hands serve for ears,' he [Ogotemmeli] said, 'to enable him to hear he always holds them on each side of his head. To tap the drum is to tap the Nummo's palms, to tap, that is, his ears.' "And further, "The heat [of drums and dancers] is also the speech of the ancestors revealed by the drum. The sweat which flows from the armpits and the body is the ancestors' words overflowing" (1975:64, 188). Similar, corporeal identification is made by Bwiti followers among the Fang of Gabon for the ngombi (a one- to eight-string harp). Its strings are considered umbilical cords that link humans, ancestors, and the gods. The whole instrument has anthropomorphic associations and is often referred to as the "tongue of Bwiti," as it is the means by which Bwiti "speaks to mankind" (Fernandez 1982:537, 656, n.9). De Vale provides a helpful summary of Fernandez's data on ngombi, which are scattered in numerous publications. The following illustrates the multiple associations of this unusual instrument, considered the voice and body of the Sister of God: The ngombi is also a vehicle for communication between living Bwiti members and their gods and ancestors; the eight strings, like the eight sacred trees, are locales for sending and receiving messages 482 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="10">between them. Its sound is simultaneously the music played by the dead in the afterworld, or by the angels in heaven in the Christianized forms of Bwiti; it transmits their blessings to the living Bwiti as well as carries the Bwitis' prayers to the ancestors and gods. [1989:59] Perhaps the most physically impressive, anthropomorphized musical instruments are the biludi, which are large (30- to 50-inch)columnar wooden aerophones with lifelike human heads and torsos that are played by the Kongo of Zaire to praise their ancestors. Carried by men who blow them through holes in the figures' backs, these instruments' treelike form links them to the ancestors and, "hooting spectrally," their sounds answer "with deep, resonant, .. tree-em- bodied noises" the men's singing, "the crying of the living," (Thompson 1981:73-75).13 Thus, their metonymic associations with the ancestors are auditory as well as visual. Stoller learned of similar identifications of musical instruments and spiritual beings during his apprenticeship with Songhay sorcerers: "Listen to the godji [violin] and let its cries penetrate you. Then you will know the voice of the spirits .... Feel the sound of the drum and know the power of our past" (1989a:101). Among the Songhay, the "crying" of the godji affects humans and spirits alike: "We cannot be unaffected by it and neither can the spirits. When they hear it 'cry,' it penetrates them. Then they become excited and swoop down and take the body of a medium" (Stoller 1989b:112). D. Ben-Amos records similar emotional reactions by beings of the otherworld to akpata and asologun performers among the Edo of Benin City (1972, 1975). For the Mbuti of the Ituri Forest in Zaire, the "voice of the Molimo," heard in times of crisis, is essential for social functioning. According to Turnbull, the voices and sounds of the molimo trumpets echo the sounds of the forest and embody the forest's spirit. "It was plain that the molimo trumpets were not considered as highly sacred objects in themselves; what was important, for some reason, was the sound they produced." Frequently, the sounds of molimo filled the camp: "It blasted and shrilled and growled and bellowed, and it rampaged around the camp" (1962:76, 82). The Mbuti related to their forest world through sound and movement, not through static carved images. Through the molimo trumpets, they create the sounds of the forest as well as their response to those sounds. The self-consciousness of their "artificial" sounds of "the animal of the forest" lessened in no way the extraordinary sacredness of their acoustic interaction. Nor did the fact that a metal drainpipe had replaced the more perishable wooden trumpet portend a loss of Mbuti traditions. It may be an indication of directions for future research that so many musical instruments have associations with otherworldly forces and beings. Not only do certain instruments "stand for" and "speak for" certain deities, but many have extremely strong powers, positive or negative. Isoko priests play the akpata ("thumb piano") in order to confuse witches and counteract their powers. Among the Edo of Benin City (just to the north of the Isoko and related in many ways), the player of the akpata (here the name of a harp-lute instrument) must always first placate the witches attracted to his performance (D. Ben-Amos 1972, 1975). The sounds of the asologun (the Edo "thumb piano") are not permitted within Benin City's boundaries because of fears that disease might be brought by such undesirable beings, who are drawn to the music. These are sounds of the otherworld and must be controlled to insure social harmony. Not only do certain restricted instruments serve to communicate messages between worlds, but some can, through their special sonic power, cause altered states of consciousness among beings of this world. Such a phenomenon among the Songhay was just cited above. Commu- nication between worlds of the Shona universe, especially through spirit mediums, is dependent on the sounds of the mbira. The mbira has the power to project its sound into the heavens, bridging the world of the living and the world of the spirits and thereby attracting the attention of the ancestors. In the hands of skillful musicians the mbira is able to draw spirits down to earth to possess mediums. [Berliner 1981:190] This brings us to the problematic area of the physiological and psychological responses to musical sound itself among many peoples, including Africans. Whatever the exact explanation, the sounds of silence 483</page><page sequence="11">it is clear from participants' testimonies that specific instruments and musics are not simply associated with cross-world communication, but that they constitute that communication and can directly affect the listener by creating higher states of consciousness and/or by healing ailments. Surely cultural context, training, expectation, and so on facilitate the auditory interaction as well as nonnormal states of consciousness and healing that people attribute to sacred sounds. Despite Rouget's (1985) extensive denials of the literal physical impact of sound and rhythm on states of consciousness, much from traditional behavior and Western science recommends our careful consideration of a physical, probably neural, response to certain repeated sounds and movements. For example, Goodman considers "acoustic driving" an essential component of glossolalia (1972:74ff., 90). The apparent antiquity and virtual univer- sality of the association of sound, movement, nonnormal states of consciousness, and healing suggests that we cannot yet reject the association of sonic power and human physiological shifts.14 auditory presence of masquerades In primarily oral-aural African communities, the visual presentation of spiritual beings at festivals and other rituals is frequently secondary to their awesome acoustic dimensions. Sound and gesture, expressed through music and dance, are utilized by masqueraders in addition to visual disguise. As embodiments of otherworldly beings, masquerades seldom rely solely on human sounds and language to articulate their identities and purposes, yet their messages are of utmost importance. Therefore, we must consider more thoroughly the auditory dimensions of masqueraders and move beyond an exclusively textual analysis of masks' speech. Actually, some African masks, often the most fearful and fantastical, remain silent, their silence serving only to intensify their terrifying nature. The potential potency of speech is heightened by its denial-a process we noted with the awesomely silent divine king. The frequent prominence of masks' mouths may signal the importance of their voices as well. Although many scholars cite the strange sounds and speech of masqueraders and even observe their need for a translator, too often there is no further description or analysis. Although full of visual detail and ethnographic background, these accounts remain silent tableaus. We need to know how visual, acoustic, and kinesic components correspond. Do portrayed animals sound the same as those danced by a neighboring people? Are primordial creatures or witches' familiars heard differently? Calame-Griaule offers insight into the mysteries of Dogon masqueraders' speech, which is the speech of the dead who are materialized in masquerades. "They let out a cry, strange and prolonged, a whinnying or high, mocking laugh. The cry reminds us that the Fox, their master (as he is responsible for death), had been deprived of human speech and could only let out an animal cry" (1986:534). But when they gain enough life force to speak, they speak in the secret language of the dead, heavily nasalized, "it is poetic, rhythmic, incantatory because it is the mode of expression that suits supernatural powers" (Calame-Griaule 1986:535). Here then, we have not only a description of Dogon "spirit speech," but also an explanation of its nature and relationship to other aspects of Dogon cosmology. Scattered references on African masquerades suggest that a nasalized, falsetto voice is a common manifestation of otherworldly speech, such as Yoshida reports for the Chewa of Zambia (1991:216). Throughout the continent, the introduction of a masquerade is acoustic, a special rhythm or an unearthly cry that signals a transition in time. For example, Cole and Aniakor note that certain Igbo night spirit masquerades "are announced by the eerie spirit sounds of bullroarers and voice-disguisers with 'shrill and wailing notes'" (1984:132). Significantly, Chinua Achebe's dramatic portrayal of Igbo masquerades fills our ears: 484 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="12">An iron gong sounded, setting up a wave of expectation in the crowd. Everyone looked in the direction of the egwugwu house. Gome, gome, gome, gome went the gong, and a powerful flute blew a high-pitched blast. Then came the voices of the egwugwu, guttural and awesome ... The drum sounded again and the flute blew. The egwugwu house was now a pandemonium of quavering voices: 'Aru oyim de dede de dei!'filled the air as the spirits of the ancestors, just emerged from the earth, greeted themselves in their esoteric language. [1987:62-63] Later in the novel, the great masks of Umuofia gather again: The dreaded Otakagu came from Imo, and Ekwensu, dangling a white cock, arrived from Uli. It was a terrible gathering. The eerie voices of the countless spirits, the bells that clattered behind some of them and the clash of matchetes as they ran forwards and backwards and saluted one another, sent tremors of fear into every heart. For the first time in living memory the sacred bull-roarer was heard in broad daylight. [1987:1 32] I quote Achebe at some length to emphasize that, even in a written account of a festival, for an Igbo man the auditory component of the masks is central to their impact. In fact, after reading these passages, we realize how vivid these masqueraders are in our minds and yet how little we know about their visual appearances. Brief commentaries on Nigerian Yoruba Egungun masqueraders' voices are indicative of what further studies might reveal. Representing ancestors who have returned to visit their descen- dants, they chant their songs in special voices. One is a high voice while the second is "a croaky voice, regarded by cult members as the real voice of the Egungun" and can only be used for the Egungun (Olajubu 1977:160). Among the Egbado Yoruba, masqueraders insure a guttural voice when they speak as spirits by drinking palm oil (Lifschitz 1988:222). To protect these essential voices, Oyo Yoruba masqueraders wear many padlocks: "Given the importance of the Egungun masquerader's voice as a means of communicating between the world of the dead and the world of the living, this use ofthe magical padlock is not surprising" (Houlberg 1978:61). Further evidence of Yoruba attention to spirits' voices is found in the Gelede masquerade complex in which the Oro Efe masquerader is known by his unique voice as much as by his visual appearance. He performs in a high, loud singing voice with a "tense, narrow, and piercing quality to his delivery" (Drewal and Drewal 1983:43). Not only are ancestors and benign beings represented in this world through masquerade. Often truly terrifying powers, which are recognized only aurally by their sounds and esoteric speech, are brought forth to punish or instruct. In his discussion of Poro traditions among the Kpelle of Liberia, Bellman describes one fearsome creature that uses "devil talk." Often when there are 'closed doors,' the devil performer does not wear a mask. Instead, he walks about in the town making the sounds of Ngwalapiye [a specific "devil"] and thereby creating an auditory illusion. Those sounds are a loud, continuous trill that is then translated by the kwelebah [messenger] to the community at large. [1 984:31 ] While this language resembles normal Kpelle speech, the key matter here is that the creature is marked exclusively by its sounds, unintelligible sounds that necessitate translation. Other Kpelle spirit beings are represented solely by musical instruments. The sounds that Malangawlaw [Ngwalapiye's 'wife'] makes are horns blown in unison by a small group of musicians who accompany the Ngwalapiye performer. Although the sounds are of four distinct musical instruments, all informant descriptions refer to the auditory effect as being a single devil. [Bellman 1984:31] Bellman also describes how another "masked devil" is, by means of auditory illusion created by initiates, made to "fly" from one side of the village to another. Members station themselves in two groups on opposite sides of the village, and one group begins to chant and blow horns, thus "creating the image of a large and powerful figure." When they stop, the other group begins (1984:32-33). These instances introduce us to a little-recognized aspect of African masquerade com- plexes-acoustic masking. Lifschitz (1988) reports a wide variety of acoustic masking systems in Africa (includingthe "disguising" of instruments voices). Most frequently, this form of disguise the sounds of silence 485</page><page sequence="13">utilizes a mirliton or voice disguiser15 (sometimes included in visual masks as well), usually constructed of a small tube closed at one end with a thin membrane, such as a spider's egg case. As with bull-roarers, these are usually hidden from women. Balfour (1948:52-55) and Keil (1979:70) discuss the meanings and behaviors associated with the powerful Imborivungu ("Owl Flute/Pipe") of the Tiv of Nigeria, actually a voice disguiser often made of a decorated human bone. In Liberia, Sapo acoustic masqueraders used to perform physically naked, relying only on their sonic disguises to conceal their humanness (Lifschitz 1988:223). Such practices emphatically demonstrate the dominance of auditory perception. While a mask's sounds are critical for cross-world communication, there is another significant function of the acoustic dimension. For those forbidden to see certain ceremonies or to attend the visitations of spiritual beings, there must be some verification of the rite. The awesome, frightening sounds that signal the spirit's arrival provide the proof. As Lamp notes, among the Temne, the men experience important aspects of the women's Bondo initiation ceremonies only as auditory because they are forbidden to see many events. One evening, the most important Bondo spirit, who sings in a "lonely whine," "is invisible in the darkness, therefore has no costume, and 'appears' only as an eerie, plaintive chant as she wafts through the village" (1988:91). We are reminded that the power of secrecy lies in limited revelation, not total ignorance. Lifschitz also notes of a common function of such embodied vocalizations of the otherworld. For the Sapo, acoustic masks, which usually "appear" at night, are far more powerful than visual masks (which only appear in the day and have disguised voices as well) and perform very serious law-giving and social-sanctioning functions (1988:224). Zemp (1968) offers a recording from a Dan village in Cote d'lvoire of such acoustic masks, which used mirlitons and performed social control functions in the past. This is reminiscent of the role of the divine king's voice and the Mbuti's use of the molimo's voice for social sanctioning. The association of the nocturnal visits of suprahuman figures with the meting out of punishment also occurs among the Fang. Here a "forest monster," who only grunts and utters gruff noises while swinging a bull-roarer, comes into the village to scare children. Intriguingly, this creature neither speaks nor wears a mask (Fernandez 1982:201). the voices of folktales From these instances of the dramatic manipulation of sound and human speech to convey the voices of the otherworld in masquerade performances, one would expect that similar careful attention would be paid to acoustic representations in the major verbal art forms of African peoples. We would expect associations of human and otherworldly speech as well, especially concerningthe origins of human languages. Various traditions assertthat members of the animal world brought speech to humans. The Dogon trace the origin of speech to the fox (Griaule 1975); while for the Fang, it is the parrot "who first brought the word, the capacity of speech, to man" (Fernandez 1982:496).16 In light of such traditions, we might recall that animal characters in folktales are primarily transformed by the attribution of human language (though actual articulation usually differs). Actually, African narratives frequently depict that, "in the beginning," humans, animals, and otherworld beings easily spoke together-a feat now only accomplished by ritual specialists. Seldom do scholars not comment on the dramatic nature of the narrator's voice (almost as if this were unexpected17), but few detail the actual vocal devices utilized. There can be little question that the narrator's vocal variations are critical to performances. Folktales are normally told at night, heightening the role of auditory cues and metaphors. Ideophones are extensively used to characterize certain behaviors, as Noss (1972) and Keil (1979:29) have discussed, but specific characters may be identified by special ideophones as well. For example, Finnegan 486 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="14">notes that the utterance of "digbi, digbi, digbi, digbi," representing a great wind, immediately signals the spirit Kumba as it is passing by (1967:80). Nevertheless, we continue to focus on visual metaphors and metonyms, while failing to hear such in auditory forms. As with spirit masquerades, otherworld beings in narratives may utilize the language of humans, but their nonhuman articulation differs, often represented by nasalization and lisping. According to Cosentino, Mende narrators of Sierra Leone represent bush spirit characters with an "imitation spirit language," which is Mende but spoken in a nasalized voice (1982:94). These beings are also recognized by their special laugh, "Nye, Nye, Nye" (personal communication, 1991). The Gbaya trickster figure, Wanto, is immediately known by his speech: "Wanto's character is exaggerated through the use of language. His speech is characterized by a variation similar to a lisp" (Noss 1971:6). A difference in pronunciation is also employed among the Limba. As described by Finnegan, "the monster's sniffing of a human in Sira and the Monster was depicted as infinf, then the breathy snuffing iteration of furu yumba furu yumba ['a human's smell, a human's smell']" (1967:79). Are these acoustic representations unique to different cultures? Although the voices of spirits, not animals, is our primary concern, Schafer's observation is especially apt: [D] ifferent languages have special onomatopoeic expressions for familiar animals, birds or insects. Aside from the phonetic limitations of language, the obvious differences in such words must indicate something about the manner in which the same sounds are heard variously by separate cultures-or is it that the animals and insects speak dialects? [1980:153, emphases in original] Schafer illustrates this point by listing various animal voices as heard in different cultures (1980:40-42). Elsewhere (Peek 1985), I have suggested that animal characters in African narratives might be chosen for their sounds and not simply for their physical characteristics and observable behavior as analyses inevitably stress. Akin to the visual iconography of masquerades and the metonymic use of key portions of animals, the auditory representations in tales may be partial yet evocative of all dimensions of a creature. Studies of auditory arts in other culture areas reveal significant possibilities. Surely what Basso heard among the Kalapalo of Brazil applies to African cultures. Throughout their narratives, "different sounds are closely correlated with different entities" and, further, "an onomatopoetic form refers metonymically to actions upon certain entities" (1985:63, 64). From his research in New Guinea, Feld recounts the Kaluli typology of birds' sounds that are associated with certain behaviors (1986). An illustration of the type of analysis of acoustic signatures that would be helpful is found in a footnote in Gottlieb's study of "Hyenas and Heteroglossia: Myth and Ritual among the Beng of Cote d'lvorie": Hyena's sound is also problematic. They howl an eerie cry. ... The Beng reproduce one of their sounds as wruuuuuu. In shortened form this is also the Beng word for a human ghost (wru), which in some circumstances is also said to howl eerily late at night. While I am not claiming an etymological relationship between the two words, the similarity in sound may cause Beng speakers to make an unspoken association between hyenas and human death. [1989:497] A further instance of the difference of speech from the otherworld, which serves to intensify its importance and our obligation to understand it properly, is the widespread tradition of the "Garbled Message" (or "Mistaken Message"), in which God's message to humans is misspoken and/or misheard, resulting in death coming into the world. Summarizing these African narra- tives, Hans Abrahamsson (1951) offers some intriguing insights about the messengers and the messages that bring such dire consequence to humans, but nowhere does he consider the unique nature of cross-world vocal communication itself. Perhaps the lesson of this intriguing tale is to be found in its emphasis on the importance of proper speaking and clear communi- cation between worlds. This reminds us that, while diviners must ask the proper question of the appropriate source, more importantly they must be able to hear and interpret answers correctly. Divinatory cross-world communication is frequently a matter of life or death. This tale of the sounds of silence 487</page><page sequence="15">confused speech further underscores the need not only to speak properly, but also to hear properly. Anomalous creatures are often the vehicles of cross-world communication and may not always be chosen for visual characteristics. While criteria for such creatures' designation certainly vary by culture, a quick review of the most popular choices, keeping in mind our focus on sound and speech, reveals some interesting commonalities. If we allow that some degree of naturalistic observation figures into these choices, then the frequent singling out of creatures such as chameleons, snakes, and pangolins may be due to their usual silence. Nevertheless, it must be added that these three creatures do sometimes utter "hissing" sounds. This in itself may be meaningful because some spirit voices issue a hissing sound. But it seems more likely that these creatures' indistinct "speech" intensifies their potency and ambiguity. In similar fashion, one wonders if the popularity of spiders, tortoises, and hares as trickster figures is not a result of similar associations. By definition, tricksters are ambiguous figures, and as we speculated earlier concerning the potency of silence, such silent creatures are extremely ambiguous. Thus, it is striking that tricksters are often "linguists," official communicators and mediators between worlds, such as the Ghanaian Ashanti spider, Anansi. Does the "natural" silence of such creatures recommend them for such roles? Are they more likely to speak like and with spiritual beings if they are not normally "heard" in this world? conclusion If human words are, as the Bamana of Mali say, the "energy of action," then surely the words of the otherworld are the very essence of action-indeed, "the forces of life" according to the Dogon. Yet these words are not easily heard. The suprahuman speech heard through divination must always be translated. Divine kings never speak as commoners do. Masqueraders are disguised vocally as well as visually, and musical instruments often "speak" as spirits. Spirits' voices in narratives are distorted in some fashion. But as the "Garbled Message" tales remind us, it is essential to hear these extraordinary voices correctly for the well-being of all in the community. The difference of otherworldly speech is represented by silence (in normal human terms, although inaudibility might be more precise), by instrumental nonhuman voices, or by radically altered human speech (either in vocabulary or sound). We might be surprised if itwere otherwise, but it remains that these voices and sounds have been little heard in our study of African peoples. And, if we are to comprehend their worlds fully, we must listen to all their sounds and silences. Sound, for example, serves as the most potent representation of the secrets and mystery of the unknown. Secrecy depends on partial comprehension, which reveals how much is unknown. The heard but not understood speech of the spirit medium or the mask presents a mystery far more powerful than the visual representation of otherworld beings. Given the importance of the means of representing the unknown, it would be well to investigate each culture's esthetics of secrecy. This article has revealed numerous representations of the "sounds of silence"-the lisped or nasalized though recognizable speech of a taleteller, the unknown spirit language of a spirit medium, the secret instrumental voices, the voice disguiser of a masquerade. What auditory criteria do a people employ to validate that which they do not know? Are there rules guiding spirit speech? Is the less distinct the more distant and thus the more sacred? Is silence the most holy? As this discussion began, "talking brought me here," and it remains that it is "talking" that we all seek to understand. But until the recording and study of African verbal arts shifts from its textual bias and listens more closely than it looks, our talk will be as empty as that of the talking skull. We should no longer accept "silent" publications on sound. Alcheringa: Ethnopoetics, a journal dealing with verbal arts, included a "soundsheet" insert (a small plastic record). A more 488 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="16">recent example is Waterman's (1990) study of contemporary Nigerian music, which was published with a cassette recording. In other words, the technology is available to augment the silence of print. Ethnomusicologists, especially Europeans, have long sounded the call, not simply for more study of African musics, butforthe importance of sound. Certainly African studies would benefit from an auditory anthropology. One cannot help but wonder why there has not been an ethnography of sound based on an African people such as Feld's (1982, 1986) of the Kaluli of New Guinea or Basso's (1985) on the Kalapalo of the Amazon Basin, which reveal audio- oriented cultures where acoustic rather than visual metaphors dominate. There are a few signposts appearing, such as Stoller's (1989a) seeking to redirect our study of other cultures. His valuable insights about the Songhay suggest how much can be gained if such a multisensory orientation guided one's initial investigations. M. Jackson (1989), Classen (1990), and Howes (1991) question our visual emphases and provide starting points for a multisensory ethnology. One must also remember Levi-Strauss's "Fugue of the Five Senses" (1969:147ff). As noted earlier, because our experience of the world is multisensory, so must be our study of that experience. Thompson's important analysis of African art and esthetics (1974), which shifts our analyses from a static to a dynamic perspective, should be listened to because his use of Yoruba, Dan, Kongo, and others' terms for dance involves the acoustic world of African societies. The esthetic vocabulary that Thompson recommends to us is largely that of the auditory arts. If we shift from our usual visual models and terminology to auditory models and terminology, will we find the same conclusions about cultural systems? Rather than seeing what we can hear, what if we try hearing what we can see (Carpenter et al. 1964)? It may be, for example, that the auditory manifestation is more essential and direct than the visual representation. If animals sound differently in different cultures, are there culture-specific sounds used by suprahuman beings? Or will we encounter the phenomena that Goodman (1972) outlines for glossolalia? She maintains that there are significant cross-cultural similarities in glossolalic utterances (see also Samarin 1972). One wonders if neighboring peoples use similar techniques, such as nasalization, to represent spiritual voices, or do they employ different devices to mark off their own distinctiveness? We might expect each culture to employ characteristic acoustic representations of individual otherworld beings who are heard in tales and masquerades as well as through spirit mediums and musical instruments. In the future, we should be able to understand the correlations of these sounds with culture-specific systems of epistemology and esthetics. Further significant correla- tions would be realized from comparative study of Haitian vodun voices and other acoustic elements of African expressive behavior in the Americas. Even after hundreds of years, the Haitian loa ("spirits") continue to listen for their personal rhythms and are recognized by their distinctive voices. Thus, increased attention to the auditory arts in their own terms will reveal previously unheard dimensions that will enhance our understanding of these cultures. An apt concluding note for this discussion of such an elusive topic is provided by Colin Turnbull, a conclusion all the more effective because, although sounds permeate his classic work, The Forest People, a study of sound among the Mbuti was not his intention. Yet, it is the sounds of molimo that reveal the essence of Mbuti life: The camp and the people disappeared, leaving only a shimmering haze over Apa Lelo, but the song remained, for the song is the soul of the people and the soul of the forest. The molimo trumpet, now infinitely wistful and far away, took up the song, and the forest echoed it on with its myriad magical sounds. It echoes on and on, and it will still be there when our short lives are silenced . . . until, perhaps like us, it comes to rest in the deepest distance of some other world beyond ... the dream world that is so real to the People of the Forest.

Many thanks to Don Cosentino, Steve Feld, Lee Haring, Tom Miller, Barry Lee Pearson, and the insightful American Ethnologist readers for reading earlier drafts of this article and offering numerous excellent suggestions. 1. The extent of our visual orientation is "seen" in our elaborate vocabulary of sight, but even more impressive is the abysmal lack of terms with which to discuss acoustic phenomena. I am recommending "auditory arts" as an umbrella term, though I would welcome a better sounding phrase. Indicative of our problem is the following suggestion by Coplan: We need a word for the highly elaborated African art of "word-music" in non-literate social contexts. For this let me suggest we develop the concept of "orature" yet further and speak of auriture, to emphasize the importance of both the hearer and multi-channeled sonic expression. A possible alternative for those troubled by the homophony of "orature" and "auriture" in spoken presentations might be the term "cantation." [1990:141-142] 2. I have recently learned that Hugo Zemp has written on Dan categories of thought as predicated on aural relationships, but this material is unavailable to me. 3. See Zuckerkandl 1956, Carpenter et al. 1964, Carpenter and McLuhan 1966, and Ong 1967. Schafer (1980:115) adds "aural space" to the discussion, in order to distinguish the range of human hearing as opposed to acoustic space and the total range of produced sound. 4. In fact, Hymes specifically stresses the complexity of West African channels of communication (1974:8). 5. This philosophy recalls some of Ong's thoughts on silence and interiority (1967:111-175) and parallels Ishii and Bruneau's comments on sound and silence's yin/yang relationship (1991:316); see also Saville- Troike 1 985. 6. To test this observation, we need a comprehensive study of silence akin to K. Basso's classic work on the Apache (1985). 7. For example, Sullivan writes of South American traditions: "Every being has a sonic structure that, given certain levels of perceptive awareness, becomes audible. Silence is a sonic form that many potent entities assume, just as invisibility may be their visual form" (1988:657). 8. This practice finds striking correspondence among the Brazilian Kalapalo, where a narrator always selects a "What-Sayer," a formal "recipient of the story" who responds during a performance with interjections, exclamations, questions, and so on (Basso 1985:15-17). For a fascinating discussion of the interlocutor's role in puppetry, see Proschan 1981. 9. Although Dundes's (1980) psychoanalytical interpretation of the bull-roarer as "flatulent phallus" may be problematic to some, the work remains an exemplary worldwide study. Another approach links bull-roarers and social structure (Levi-Strauss 1973:41 1-422). 10. Speaking from a musician's point of view, Berliner stresses the depth and complexity such attach- ments add to the mbira's sound (1981:128-30). 11.

Of special interest here is that, according to an Igbo folktale, the first ikoro was inhabited by woodpeckers (Cole and Aniakor 1984:87). 13. Charle Duvelle (1966) recorded such an ensemble in a Bembe village. 14. See also Neher 1962; Needham 1967; A.

Similar voice disguisers have long been used in European puppetry traditions, such as Punch and Judy shows (Proschan 1 981). 16. Despite this critical association, Fernandez recalls no mention by the Fang of parrots ability to mimic noises and human speech (personal communication, 1992). Whileone is left wondering how else the initial linkage of parrots and speech was established, it remains that African peoples are not known for keeping parrots and training them to mimic human speech as Europeans and Americans do. Thus, one's interest might better turn to questioning Western customs in this regard. 17. My appreciation to Lee Haring for this observation. references cited Abrahamsson, Hans 1951 The Origin of Death. Studia Ethnographica Upsaliensia III. Uppsala: Almquist and Wiksells Boktryckeri AB.
