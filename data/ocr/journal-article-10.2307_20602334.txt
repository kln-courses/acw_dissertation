<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMMENT MY LADY'S DAMASK CHEEK Selected Poems, by James Schuyler. Farrar, Straus, and Giroux. $25.00 cloth; $12.95 paper. Despite disclaimers ("you can't talk about the weather / it's like saying my lady's damask cheek"), the poems in James Schuyler's Selected are weather altogether: the inner weather of urban pastoral and out-of-the-closet, in and out of the sanatorium, pill-popping, name-dropping, unobtrusively fi nanced, neo-confessional ennui. Wage labor is as rare and camp and alarming a presence as are women in these pages: the story is deeply class-inscribed ("men who don't make much aren't much / for spending what they do / on glass eyes, tooth-straightening devices ... nose jobs, dewenning operations / a country look prevails"). By contrast, Flora's fair-faced children (siblings to the damask rose) occupy a priv ileged position in Schuyler's poems as in his Manhattan apart ment and in the recreative landscapes-New England, mar itime Canada, Long Island, and upper New York State defined by affluent Manhattan and its rituals of retreat. The fair-fleshed human is rendered with abandon and often with abandon's double edge, as is the physiology of sex. If not the weather then that other atmospheric locution-nature's rei terated round of days and seasons-is lushly documented in these pages and unabashedly made a figure for the soul and its longings. These conflations of desire and Nature belong to a tradition of which Romanticism was the mere by-blow. Witness Narcissus, whose self-regard at last took the form of a flower. The features described above-parodic, traditional, self incriminating, self-absorbed-are the deliberate features of a poetic project that has achieved considerable public acclaim by flaunting itself as coterie. The paradox is an old one. Main line Petrarchists have always pretended to write for private circulation while making public spectacle of the heart's most inward throbbings. Schuyler writes his poems in an epistolary mode, the mode that affects indifference to publication; he 35'</page><page sequence="2">POETRY names his correspondents, flatters and reproaches them, in scribes them as an exclusionary community of taste. When he crosses the epistolary mode with that of the exhibitionist daybook (menus, shopping lists, the reiterative record of bowel movements, insomnias, erections, injestions of antidepres sants and Antabuse), Schuyler crosses the lineage of Sidney and Ralegh with that of Clarissa. The love lyric plays midwife to the novel in these poems; they derive their heat, their some times considerable length, and their excruciating detail from the logorrhea of forestalled seduction. Schuyler's is a poetry of sentiment, even of sentimentality, and of passive-aggressive ironies. It is a poetry, at times, of ravishing beauty and a poetry, always, of enormous structural intelligence. It is a poetry whose deployments of genre and rhetorical address make it a central document in the interlineated history of style, politics, and sexuality. What is the nature of this rhetorical address? Schuyler's an nounced coterie takes its contours from the worlds of art, New York, and homosexuality. His short list of classic erotica runs the gamut from The Faerie Queene and Hesperides to The Gay Insider and Run Little Leather Boy. His work makes stylistic dis criminations (high camp, East Fifties queen) that will be obscure to portions of the general public. Some contrasts in de corum may be useful here. In the work of Elizabeth Bishop and William Meredith, the distinction between the common reader and the intimate or front-line reader is chiefly encoded in ded ications and in the ungendered second-person. In Merrill, most notably in his Ouija Commedia, the domestic partner and the circle of admired companions are made the agents of aesthetic and prophetic mediation, while the unremitting urbanity and high-cultural affiliation of poetic voice serve to educate a read ership into sensibility, to fashion, as Spenser does, an audience of courtiers. In Ashbery, the elusive second person serves to obscure rather than to precipitate distinctions between the ini tiated and the great unwashed. Party to a dispersed, meta physical dialogic, Ashbery's "you" is a fluid property, mod ulating to refract the reader, the self, the rhetorical subject, the res publica, the pushy, democratizing handshake of American semantics, as in "you wouldn't want to be seen in there" and "your typical big business scam." Schuyler's "you" is easier to locate in the phone book, is bound by circumstantial evidence, is even called upon to supply circumstantial evidence: 352</page><page sequence="3">LINDA GREGERSON ... What I can't remember is the name of my New York doctor: "Murray." But Murray what? I must have it Written down someplace, and if I haven't "you" can tell me. When you read this poem you will have to decide Which of the "yous" are "you." MORNING OF THE POEM Without missing a beat or crossing a line-break, the "you" thus taunted with contigency or indeterminacy reassumes the familiar outlines of the poem's dedicatee, the painter Darragh Park: ... you will have to decide Which of the "yous" are "you." I think you will have no trouble, as you rise from your chair and take up your Brush again and scrub in some green, that particular green, whose name I can't remember. Thus between amnesia and amnesia the poet coyly drops and retrieves again the drapery of dense quotidian, the gossipy tissue of "fact" that makes a field or figure of the self. Just glimpsed between the double erasure and the double expo sure, Schuyler's problematized "you" fleetingly acknowl edges a layered and a shifting audience, as much the product of wavering fidelities and attention spans as of the tensions between the inner circle of friends, lovers, and cognoscenti and the outer circle of duller, straighter, differently anxious and aroused lookers-on, that circle reduced to buying the book. Even for those on the mailing list, the letter when it arrives may not say / what you hoped / Or distraction robs it of what it once would have meant" ("Hymn to Life"). Schuyler relies, in short, on overlay and overkill, on abut ment and conspicuous indecorum to prompt the uneven com prehension and unsteady collaboration of a readership on whom he in turn bestows a mixed regard. Not for him the homog enizations of consensus Culture. He flaunts the world's flattest line ("This pear tastes good") and drops the torch passed on by his masters ("the waves come yapping / something about 'wine dark' "; "A / Quote from Aeschylus: I forget"). Ren dering landscape, he aggravates the timeworn coersions of anthropomorphism by drawing his metaphors from the mar keting end of human manufacture ("The trees / say Wesson. Mazola / replies a frog"; "In Y's and V's and W's / an elm 353</page><page sequence="4">POETRY ascends / smoothly as an Otis Elevator"). Time killed, time savored, the comforts of toast and jam, little revenges against "the friends who come to see you / and the friends who don't," mortality's debris: the midden-heap of consciousness takes its outline from a number of circumstantial correlatives. In "The Payne Whitney Poems," the poet derives truant rumination from the enforced tedium of the psychiatric ward; in "The Morning of the Poem," from a vaguer recuperative stay at his mother's house in upstate New York. In "The Crystal Lithium," syntactical and associational slippages render the reciprocal contamination of buffered senses, the flash and shutdown of chemical normalcy. But the distinctive contour of Schuyler's loquacity in each case exceeds its occasion; mi metic plausibility is not the chief interest of these poems. They are written to charm and to affront. Narcissism is their vaunted affliction and their offering. They come to tell us that the world is a world of vested interests and of difference. They are not always nice. As to mny lady's damask cheek, two aspects (apart from the fact that the lady's in drag, of which, more later): mingled in it like the red and white are venerable traditions of sexual desire and of lyric poetry. Schuyler's Selected Poems is filled with erotic tribute, tracing a fast and a fraught course through the history of love-in-verses. Among the poems from his first book (Freely Espousing), Schuyler includes a translation of the second of Dante's Rime petrose, a sestina in which form is explicated as the structure of obsessional desire, a structure later codified by Petrarch and thence by all the propagating sonneteers. Also from Freely Espousing and drawn from an other branch of the same lyric tradition is Schuyler's elegy to the orgasm (" 'The Elizabethans Called It Dying' "), a poem whose associational detours trace the para-ejaculatory drift of mind. In subsequent volumes the love poems come in droves, some (like "Eyes") pure loveliness and some ("Steaming Ties") limp sentiment and third-class puns. "A Head" is classic bla zon, a poem whose sumptuous description discloses the pro prietary haggling, the fragmentation, and the fetish implicit in this sub-genre of lyric praise. It is also a back-handed play on words: the boy with the beautiful head appears to give head too. By heaping up brand names ("You . . . kicked / off Gucci loafers") and the other detritus of appetite ("The night is filled with indecisions / To take a downer or an 354</page><page sequence="5">LINDA GREGERSON upper / To take a walk / To lie / Down and relax"), Schuyler insists on the currents of banality and consumerism that mod ulate erotic address; desire, as he shrewdly narrates it, is the story of renewable discards. With deflationary self-exposures (" 'Can't / you be content with / your wife and me?' "), Schuyler willfully destabilizes the tone while mirroring the structure of neo-Petrarchan complaint, and his negotiation with literary precedent is typified by back-handed homage to Donne's "The Relic," in which he rejects, along with fine phrasing, the sanitizing, idealizing, out-of-the-body Chris tianizing justification of heterosexual love: "This hair bracelet won't tell us much." Women play the unenviable role of triangulations in these poems, bartering chits in the conduct of homoerotic affairs. Their transit is sometimes brief, as in the negligent traverse of simile ("Summer apples . . . a finger bruise on thin skin / brown and silently reproachful as your wife's black eye"), and sometimes more prolonged, as when Lena Horne is made the currency of pickup in "Pop Tunick's long-gone gay bar." Horne sings "Mad about the Boy" on the jukebox; Schuyler keeps plugging his money in and making a play for one of the fellow patrons. Even in its "straight" version, the music is a thumb-nail history of appropriation: sexual passion smol ders a bit when sung by a black woman to a paying public that is largely white, heterosexual, and male. Smoldering heats up when the performance is restaged by a constituency (gay) with a history of oppression and a motive for subversion as significant as are the singer's own. The abrasion produced by such an appropriation is part of its capacity for titillation: Schuyler's social critique, if such it is, does not much hunger after the homogenizing prospect of cross-gendered or cross cultural common cause. The frictive pleasures of the scene at the gay bar endure long past their original moment; success fully picked up, the poet's lover makes Lena Horne the stick ing point in a drawn out, teasing debate about sexual coding and predilection ("he / thought it was East Fifties queen / taste"). Even in verse, Lena Horne is a trope with a history: in Frank O'Hara's "Biotherm," passion makes its louche dec laration between two tributes to Lena Horne: " 'I am a woman in love,' he said." A more convoluted figure of gendered triangulation pro vides the punch line in "Letter to a Friend: Who Is Nancy 355</page><page sequence="6">POETRY Daum?" In a love letter, the poet describes the French lamp on his desktop-glass stemmed, glass shaded, and signed by the maker, "Daum, / Nancy." "Hence I surmise / she made / or, at least, / designed it. / Who is Nancy Daum?" Nancy Daum is, of course, a joke of double inscription, the naive writer's failure to distinguish between place name (Nancy) and first name (Nancy). She is woman as misprision or, worse, faux pas. But she is also a faux faux pas, the throw-away that binds the writer and his intimate correspondent in their su perior command of cultural encodings. These cultural encod ings include the exaggerated gender play of butch and femme. The signature of "Nancy Daum," described in a postscript, supplements the other coy signature beneath which it occurs: "(signed)- / all my / -you know- / ton / Dopey." It is thus another version of the "camp name" Schuyler elsewhere re veals as "Dorabella." The play at stake in the camp name is the play that determines who may be a player: "If anybody called / me by my camp name / nowadays I'd sock them." Women, for the most part, are not among the players in this book. Oh, they will do for a supporting friendship or two-autobiography's spear carriers-but they more typically serve to mark the bounds, by being outside the bounds, of taste. They are irritants: the "help" (the maid "stinking up the house with household ammonia"), the "assistant" who makes breakfast and lunch ("I think I'll / let her take the laun dry / out; she needs the exercise"). They are the common coinage of malicious gossip (the "future Duchess of W.," who got where she's going by being "a circus in bed"). They are the self-exposing purveyors of phobia and false orthodoxy ("'I got her number: / "Why did you tell him homosexuality is a neurosis?"' / I said, 'She said / She didn't say it, but she did"'). The free expression of what we now call sexual pref erence, including the varieties of heterosexuality, have too often entailed hostility between and within the sexes, though there are those who wish to believe that this need not be the case. Hostilities are rife in Schuyler's poetry, no less so because they are conducted ironically, often within literal quotation marks. The contest, as he stages it, is about the mastery of nuance; who governs the subtlest transactions of taste can establish his taste as normative. Erotics are commodity everywhere, but the pace and pres sure of the marketplace are central to the libidinal self-portrait 356</page><page sequence="7">LINDA GREGERSON Schuyler draws. He cruises the supermarket ("trying to get a front view of / him and see how he was / Hung"). He ogles the delivery boy ("funny-faced, skinny and muscular, red gold hair, and, sigh, / wears a broad plain wedding ring"). He vamps ("I wish I had a rose / Or butterfly tattoo . . . Here on / my arm or inner / Thigh, small, where / Only the happy few / Might see it"). He writes the unstoppable memoir of sexual debacle: shore-leave liaison with a soldier who turns out to be "trade," the apartment ripped off by the drugged out lover of a lover, the chase-scene-with-a-deadly-weapon staged around a kitchen table. And everywhere-past and present, fantasy and fact-the odds on flesh and passion are leveraged by age. Rueful, vindictive, and comic by turns, Schuyler writes the ill-sorted tale of Love and Time. In middle age, he is a lover perpetually "on the sniff" though mostly quiescent ("I haven't beat my meat in days") or impotent from Antabuse, a lover increasingly sidelined by the premium set on youth ("now men my age are not / Interested in me, they seek out beauties, blue-eyed, / blond and tanned . . . there's no democracy"). The vamp and the complaint are too stylishly deshabille to be the helpless revelations of feeling or circumstance; they are rather the knowing, portending pos tures of rhetoric. That is to say, the poet has designs on his readers, who are at once potential conquests and interloping lookers-on (both versions of "the happy few"). What is more, the poet has the means and the motive to expose the dynamics of readership: his postures are heuristic. Played out as soap opera, confessionalism's vamp and complaint are invitations to voyeurism; played out as laundry list, confessionalism's excessive documentation is voyeurism's surfeit and negation. Schuyler plays both sides of a transaction quite perilous to self-esteem. Schuyler is kiss and tell; he's a name-dropper and a snob; he's archivist of his own bon mots ("when our best poet was invited / To review one of your little offerings I said, / 'Won't it be like / Reviewing your reflection in an oil slick?' "). He is also a savage satirist ofjust such self-reflexive merchandizing (" 'Oh / I was beautiful, oh the most / Fa mous men all fell for me and slipped it up / my cooze' "). The past tense is the nastiest indictment of all. Death is the subplot; death lurks behind every parenthesis. Dining with a friend at McFeely's, the bar of the old Terminal Hotel, the poet feeds on a menu of memento morn ("Dining 357</page><page sequence="8">POETRY Out with Doug and Frank"). McFeely's, Terminal. New York is riddled with puns as with memories, and every urban set ting bears the weight of things that are no more: the mirror glass at Gage and Tollner's, the Hudson River ferries, the Singer Building, Fairy Soap, a lengthening list of friends and enemies ("At least twice when / someone I knew and hated / died ... I smiled and laughed out / loud"). Though it hap pens behind the arras or happens offstage ("I wouldn't go / when he wanted to see me when / he was dying of leuke mia"), death is the engine that makes the plot proceed: "Why is this poem / so long? And full of death? . . . 'Enough is as good / as a feast' and I'm a Herrick fan." The questions are rhetorical. Exemplary Herrick sat down to a feast (his Julia's breasts fresh cheese and cream, her nipples strawberries), but he smelled the stench of death between two cherry lips (and thus advised women to hide their rotten and rusty teeth). Exhorting virgins to seize the day, Herrick lodged beneath the language of compliment the steely reminder that appetite is mortal too. Why is Schuyler a Herrick fan? And why is his poem so long? Death is the mother of alibis. From death we want distraction. Death is also the mother. In Schuyler's most recent long poem ("A Few Days"), he makes his most extravagant display (so far) of tedium and laundry lists. The poem is chockablock with the details of diet and interior dec, of pill consumption ("seven Sleepeze, two Nembutal, / the scoffed pills, three / antidepressant pills, a red pill that controls the side / effects of the antidepressants,") and cologne consumption ("Help! my Eau / de Portugal is half empty"), of personal hygiene, wardrobe, and insomnia-all the proliferant, excremental documentations of identity ("Here is my Blue Cross/ / Blue Shield number: I1223677 / H08"). Elusive as ever, identity is the ghost in the machine. Also in this poem, Schuyler makes his most extravagant display of maddening, manipulative de pendence in matters practical: it is others who cook, who clean, who work for mnoney, who care for the dying. Dying is what we're all up to ("A Few Days // are all we have"), but dying with a difference and for good in the course of this poem is the poet's mother. He wasn't there; he'll stay home from the funeral; the phone call with the news is what finally shuts his story down. The business of the story is diversion ary: "don't dwell on the grave, which yawns for / one and 358</page><page sequence="9">LINDA GREGERSON all." Answering the voracious yawn with the yawn of induced and remedial boredom, Schuyler makes the good effort, the penman's effort, not to dwell on the grave but to live with it. A mock-up of Freudian parable, the poem is an elegy whose subject is everywhere apparent and everywhere repressed. Selected Poems concludes with two lyric celebrations of the poet's newest crush and "secretary," a blond "Apollo" who comes four days a week to make breakfast. But Apollo loves E., another young man, whose mother is worried. "I'm / going to tell her how / lucky her son is," the jealous poet resolves. In an earlier poem, Schuyler describes gaining access to his first crush by playing courtier to the young man's mother, on whom the real plot was necessarily lost. What are these mothers to him? And why should he use them as le verage? It's been twenty years since Stonewall, but mothers still tend to worry. Mothers are living proof that the story of gay life must still be conversion narrative-or subversion nar rative, the ironizing mastery of distance from one domestic generation to the next. Generation: the oppressive, tautolog ical hegemony of procreation. Mothers are in their very bod ies-the ones that made children, the ones that made us-the life that must be thrown over. In his newest ode to the "only and always beautiful," Schuyler identifies his Apollo by first name, middle name, last name, by lineage, and by hometown. We're back to blazon, the thwarted version of kiss and tell just in case the young man's mother has yet to figure things out. Petty blackmail, the ingenious double play of petition and promotion (in a new variation on the old Petrarchan for mula, the young man celebrated for his beauty launches his own career in poetry), publicity as enticement, publicity as revenge: all's fair. Sweet love plays hardball. Schuyler came of age "back in the Turkish bath days"; he still puts "gay" in quotes sometimes. His ironies record the extent to which homosexuality in our culture has had to con struct its discursive and presentational styles under seige. Its styles are among the most brilliant and alluring we have: capable of the most complex cultural work, the most so phisticated, speculative self-fashioning, the most finely shaded and radical wit. Schuyler's poems, with their apparent record of compromised intention and disarray, are in fact the agents and repositories of consummate stylistic glamour. It is no accident that his corpus of indecorum is also a corpus of im 359</page><page sequence="10">POETRY peccable technique-his lineation alone would furnish a man ual of style. Despite its displays of vulnerability, and they are rife, despite its capacities for entertainment, and they are sub lime, Schuyler's poetry is not meant to be ingratiating, nor is it best honored by deferential readings. The poet claims full privileges for ruthlessness and sentiment both. "I / am trou bled by hatred for / the dead," he writes. And also, mani festly, for the living. There's no understanding the love in these poems-its plentitude, its fever, its omnivorousness, its recoil without crediting the hatred. LINDA GREGERSON 360</page></plain_text>
