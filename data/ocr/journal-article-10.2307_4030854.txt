<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON THE DEMONOLOGY OF THE TABASARANIANS TYPOLOGY AND DESCRIPTION RUSLAN SEFERBEKOV Makhachkala A millennium-plus supremacy of Islam and of Muslim culture among the Tabasaranians ousted the pagan rituals - the system of pre-Islamic religious ideas which has been retained in a rather fragmentary form. The construction of this system, of primarily the pantheon and the pandemonium, is hampered beside other things by the lack of whatever classification. There- fore we tried in this paper to provide a certain systematic presentation of the available materi- al, which could be subsequently developed. In this regard it seems rigchtful to divide all mythological figures by their hierarchical stand- ing. The hierarchical depiction of gods and demons must probably be the spatial-temporal para- meters: their occupied place within the three-term vertical structure of the Cosmos (thle upper world - Heaven, the middle world - Earth, the lower world - the Underworld, Erebus'), archa- ic character, their effect upon man and society. In this paper we shall consider the system of the demonology only. The demons are supernatural characters who, being not gods, occupy a comparatively lower place in the hierarchy. In a narrower and more precise sense the demons are evil spirits.2 The contradistinction itself of gods and demons inhabiting the differing cosmic worlds (Heav- en for gods and Hell for demons) suggests the idea of using the basic interconnected binary oppositions when classifying the demons (tlhere are other systems of classifications as well)? The major boundary line here seems to be the ethic categories expressed in the opposition of good and evil, with the demons mostly divided into the unambiguously hostile, heinous ("Dev- ilry proper or evil spirits are the names used for the demonic images mainly characterized by their propensity to inflict harm upon people in many different ways"),4 and very occasionally favourable to humans, in some cases combiniing those and other features (syncretism, ambiva- lence and multifunctional character of some demons). However, beside the spatial characteris- tics expressed in the binary opposition: near - far, and allocation ("each place is linked with a certain host, a goblin in the forest, a water-spirit in the river, a boggard in a home, etc.",5 "a bathhouse is a dwelling of the bath spirit, an oveni and a tlhreshold - of the home spirit" 6), demons can be classified by the degree of proximity to man, i. e., the ones inhabiting: a) the man-reclaimed space (living premises, a yard, a village with environs); and b) irreclaimed space (beyond the village, beyond the river, in the forest, in the mountains, etc.), and even a hostile space (a cemetery). Quite naturally the mytlhological characters are divided by sex: male and female. As noted by A. 1. Egorova, "the symbols of the male and female origins are most vividly represented in the cosmogonic, zoomorphic and anthropomorphic myths, in the cults of divinities and spirits, in the numerical symbols of genders, as well as in the binary oppositions".7 The latter, as a rule, link the "female" opposition with the negative; the other world (compare the series: femnale - left - internal - closed - alien - "unclean";8 feniale - left - bad - dead - western - "the inside"9). It is interesting to note in this connection that most Tabasaranian gods and deities surviv- ing to date (excepting the agrarian ones) are male, while the demons are female, which is asso- ciated with thle natural-historic transition of mankind from the maternal to thle paternlal ances- try. Meanwhile, transition to androcracy in religion "results in the femininity being replaced by masculinity, the female spirits are converted into male spirits",'? moreover, "with the consoli- dation of patriarchal relations, the female divinities are eithler subverted to impersonate the forces of evil, or are subjected to the male divinities, or else, are simply forgotten"'." IRAN &amp; the CAUCASUS, voL 5, 2001, pp. 139-148 @ International Publications of Iranian Studies</page><page sequence="2">RUSLAN SEFERBEKOV Thus, the "general trend of developing the mythological systems is (when decaying) trans- formation of gods into demons with the latter retained rather as the evil demons"."2 Demons, like gods, have their scale of influence (realm) embracing the boundaries of individual (or groups of) villages, associations of rural communities, the entire ethnos, or even going back to quite earlier ethnic commonalities (Protolezgin, Protodagestanian and similar linguistic and ethnic commonalities). With regard to the aforementioned, it it to be stated that the basic foundations of typologi- cal classification of the Tabasaranian demons are featured by the multifaceted characteristics: ethic categories, spatiality and allocation, proximity to man, gender, scale of influence. Thus, the demonology of the Tabasaranians can be presented as follows: a) domestic serpents; b) boggards; c) demons antagonizing women in labour; d) demons impersonating diseases; e) demons of the cemetery. Proceeding on a specific feature of the Tabasaranian demons, it should be noted that on many occasions we have adhered to the description schemes for mythological characters suggested by L. N. Vinogradova and S. M. Tolstaya.'3 Domestic Serpents Featuring the souls of deceased ancestors in the popular mind are domestic serpents. The Tabasaranians know them as the "basement snakes" (gibritIarin bitlar) or "snake 9avgbiar"(9avgbar-bitI). The domestic serpent lives in a place long-inhabited by man: a base- ment, or more often than not in a headway under the ceiling thus making use of the Tabasaran dwellings. A structural element of the Tabasaran home like the central pole, having originated from the former forest resources, was not widely spread any more. The support function of the floor was done by the support beam up to 12-16 m long. The Rutuls also have the mykmagar ("ceiling snake") live in the central beam of the ceiling.'4 It is interesting to note that one of the names for the boggard used by the Aguls is givadikken which can be translated as "living under the ceiling". In the Dargin and Avar homes the domestic serpent (Kini, Kune, Ka2)'s resides mainly in the central pole of the building. Its exterior, as told by the persons who had allegedly seen the serpent, is black with yellow glints and red eyelets. A ritually "pure" creature. It has no posterity. It will never bite a mem- ber of the household. Associated with it is welfare and abundance. To kill it is a great sin, it means to incur trouble and misfortunes. The domestic snake will signal its presence with a spe- cial clhirping sound. In those cases they say: "The gavgbiar-serpent is chirping, it wants trib- ute". On Thursday night the housewives put a treating under the ceiling for the serpent - bread dabbed with avarsha, a sweet paste with no salt or sugar. The Lak wives also prepared sugar- less halvah to treat the domestic serpent Klini'6 According to the Avars, the serpent Ka2 likes to rest on bowls with booze. The booze has to be always fetched by the same person wearing the same clothes and carnying the same jar. The Ka2, recognizing this person, remains calm, and the booze will never finish. If however, the booze is drawn by different persons, the Kazh will vanish carrying away the welfare of the house." Analyzing the origins of revering the domestic serpents, N. Kharuzin wrote: "A harmless snake boldly creeping into a dwelling, must attract attention of an uincivilized person becaLuse he is used to seeing snakes as his enemies. He will willingly identify a harmless snake as a totem, and after the totemic notions sink into oblivion he will be able to explain the benevo- lence of this breed by assuming that it harbours the transmigrated souls of his tribesmen.'8 The cult of kindly serpents (grass-snakes) guarding the contents of a vessel and a dwelling has been known since early Neolithl.'9 Thus, the mythological image of domestic serpents have embodied anamorphic concepts of the elder of the house - a wise keeper of the principles of family hearth and traditions. 140</page><page sequence="3">ON THE DEMONOLOGY OF THE TABASARANIANS The Boggard The boggard is consistently called Rux by the Tabasaranians, sometimes with the adding bab (bav) translated as "mother" or "grandmother", depending on context. This addition to the basic name clearly indicates that the boggard is thought of as a female ("there can be a female boggard").20 It seems that the Tabasaran name Rux is of the same type as the Lezgin Ux,2' the Avar OxI, Roxo,22 Roxbdulay23 - very archaic syncretic characters dating back to the Pro- todagestanian ethnic and linguistic unity. The names Ux, OxI, Rux, Roxo, Roxbdulay and the like are, to our mind, onomatopoeic reflections of moans and rales emitted by humans in sleep when sick or delirious. Rux has a vague, amorphous, occasionally zoomorphic (bear, wolf, cat) or slightly anthro- pomorphic image with certain physical abnormalities ("no left nostril", "one eye in the fore- head, one nostril lacking, no mouth"), pointing out to the super-mundane nature of this char- acter. Among other features of the boggard the informants mention the colour: "something dark", ritual "purity", being indifferent and supernatural: "neither good nor bad, his appearance is unknown, God sends him to make man understand his strength". Despite mainly its feminine nature, Rux wears a man's cap. In most cases the informants were not at ease to point out the boggard's permanent loca- tion. In some villages they thought that Rux does not live in the house, that he is not domestic, his habitation is in the structures breeding all kind of dirty things. As to the house, it is where he contacts with man. Rux commonly visits people in the night (usually at midnight). As a rule, midday and midnight are considered to be the moments which are critical and mysterious. 24 Rux is silent ("in folklore, dumbness is an attribute of belonging to the world of the dead"),25 and, in contrast to the Lak Suxasulu,2' the Dargin CebilxbXbana,27 the East-Slavonic AOMOBOH, 8 does not do the fortune-telling. The ambivalence of this character is seen in the symbiosis of the two opposing predications: malicious will - guardianship. The former action is that Rux mostly overlays alone face-up sleeper, mostly an elderly person, just to smother him. The person attacked by the boggard remains in a kind of prostration: he hears Rux slow- ly and creakily open the door, come up to the bed, lean against him and smother him, but he cannot budge, nor utter a sound. There is a belief that a person who died smothered by the bog- gard, will get to Paradise, since he died of evil spirits. The boggard owns magic objects: a magic cap, or a reel. The Boggard puts those magic objects upon the jug of water that has to be placed near the sleeper's head. According to one version, before leaning, Rux will put his cap on the jug. If you dodge the boggard, jump up and touch the jug, you will get rich very sud- denly. But if you succeed to snatch the cap and don it, you will become invisible for others, while Rux, on the contrary, will become visible. By another version, it is not a cap but a magic reel - the source of unending wealth. There is a belief that the boggard leans not on anyone, mostly on a good man who will become rich after hiis visit. There is even a saying: "Happy is the one pressed down by Rux". A universal belief is that if at the moment when Rux is lean- ing over someone, you order him: "go and lean over such-and-such foodstuffs!", then the stock of foodstuffs will be enlarged and they will never finish, but the meeting with the boggard and the talk shall be kept secret, otherwise the order will loose strength. Those actions of guardianship associated with the wealth to be awarded, the inexhaustible foodstuffs symbolizing the welfare and bounty, express the second positive predication of the boggard. Yet, despite the undisputable link of the boggard with welfare and bounty, there is an entire arsenal of charms intended to screen a person from unwanted contacts with the boggard. There existed a tabu for pronouncing the name of the boggard, based on a sign: "Talk about the boggard in the day, he will come at night."29 The boggard was thought to fear water, light, fire, as well as verbal charmns like the Arabic formula bismillaghi ragbim, or a triple reading of the prayer kbulgbu. There was also a spell against Rux.3 141</page><page sequence="4">RUSLAN SEFERBEKOV The effective mTeasures protecting from the visits by the obtrusive boggard were: ashes scat- tered near the threshold, a broom or a rifle at the bedside, bread, an open clasp-knife, a dagger, ashes from the bones of a wolf or a bear, a woman's necklace of black stones. Those too much annoyed by the boggard were advised to sleep face down or at somebody's side. It is interesting to note that some villages had a special device for getting rid of the bog- gard's visits for good. That had to be achieved by eating bread and urinating at the same time, which can be regarded as a way of ritual self-defilement in order to get clean. In everyday life a great sin is a contact with bread at the moment of urination, even if it is in the pocket. Thus, the complicated syncretic image of the Tabasaranian boggard Rux combines many controversial features, among which the following can be identified: 1) the dualism of good and evil; 2) an androgenous nature of the character expressed in the combination of mainly femi- nine (feminine suffixes) and individual masculine attributes (wearing a man's hat); 3) the poly- morphic quality of a demon that can appear in the anthropo-, zoo-, and the amorphous hypostases; 4) transcendental nature expressed in a) invisibility (the mythological symbol of death);3' b) dumbness; c) physical abnormalities - no mouth, one nostril and one eye in the fore- head (the last abnormality shows a particular magic strength);32 d) left-sidedness (no left nos- tril); e) possessing magic objects (magic hat and reel); 5) the multifunctional nature of the bog- gard is seen in the symbiosis of several features of a disease demon (pressing and smothering), and perhaps a master of handicraft (has a reel of thread that can be unreeled infinitely), and also a divinity associated with the water element (one attribute is a jug of water). Analyzing the origins of the image of the boggard, S. A. Tokarev noted that "the origin of this character is perhaps related to the time when, with the decay of the ancestral formation the individual family was becoming an independent social unit".33 It is also to be noted that the boggard has assumed the features of some female divinities of the matriarchal epoch. As in the case of the domestic serpent, lying in the basis of the boggard image is the ancestral cult. "Tlhe unseen guardian of the family, embodying its welfare, was associated in the popular mind with the image of the ancestor, the defunct master".4 Also to indicate is a certain conditionality of classifying the Tabasaranian spirit Rux as a boggard, which is expressed, e.g., in the lack of clarity (in contrast to the domestic serpent) as to the Rux's habitat, his weak patronage functions, etc. The idea of the boggard smothering a man during sleep, owning magic objects (a neckless, a rod, a cap, a reel) was also shared by other peoples of Dagestan.3" This mythological charac- ter was also known to many other peoples of the world. E. g. the Ossetic boggard (Bynaty xicau) is a female;3' cf. also among the Slavs,3" the Europeans (Poltergeist), etc.38 Demons Antagonizing Women In Labour While domestic serpents associated with the welfare and prosperity, are mainly benevolent, and the image of the boggard Rux is ambivalent (both the evil-minded and relieving action), the demons mainly targeted on a woman in labour, are unambiguously evil. The demons steal- ing the fetus from the mother's womb are depersonalized and given the Islamic name of jinar- geytInar. However, a number of local names for these demons also is attested among the Dagestanians: Lak Avdaly,39 Dargin-Tsudakhar AvfigIune,? Avar-Khvarshin Budulla-ba,4' etc. The demons visit the pregnant women to steal their fetus. In the morning the women are found as good as dead. The sign of the demonic visitation is the bloody imprint of a palm on tihe wall. In some villages this imprint remained if the stolen fetus was feminine. If however it was mas- culine, the trail of blood was left by the demons on the oxbow ropes. In the Khvarshin villages a similar character left two traces on a windowsill.42 Among the Tajiks the demon Olbasti or 01 "sometimes hurts a new-born child by striking it with her hand, the stricken place clearly showing a black edema with a palm trace, and the child later dying".43 The informants ignore where the demons dispose of their stolen fetus. To screen the womanl from the effects of jinar- 142</page><page sequence="5">ON THE DEMONOLOGY OF THE TABASARANIANS geitInar and to retain the fetus, they threw fish bones into a camp fire, and their smoke was used to fumigate the pregnant woman's body (genitals). The sharp fish bones interacting with a fire derivative - smoke, perhaps guarded from the demons. The concept of fairies stealing infants from mothers, could also be found in the West European folklores." While the basic object of attention for the amorphous, unpersonified and undifferentiated evil spirits jinar-4eitlnar is the fetus, the main object of influence for the evil demon Yarsel is a young mother after the childbirth, when she is left alone in the room. Yarsel appears to the mother in sleep (sleep - reality), in a female form (female - male), it is of a dark colour (dark- ness - light), it is introduced as next of kin within the tuxumn (friend - foe), like an aunt, and attempts to fling a black reel of woolen thread around her neck. If Yarsel succeeds in flinging the thread around the neck, the lying-in woman dies, but if the latter prevents it by pushing the reel away, she will stay alive. The appearance of Yarsel in sleep makes her akin to Rux. The functions, predications and object of influence of Yarsel are in many ways similar to another antagonist of the women in labour - the demon Al, which has resulted in a confusion between those characters: in some villages the informants identified Yarsel witlh Al. Through lack of data, the image of Yarsel is poorly identified. Perhaps we deal here with the patron of an indi- vidual tuxum, that with the decaying ancestral formation had degenerated into an evil demon and was ousted or absorbed by the Al having resemblant features. Perhaps, the range of func- tions of this mythological character was much more extensive in the past. E. g., it could also have been patron of weaving (carpet making) with regard to the attribute - a reel of black yarn and the advancement of this craft among the Tabasaranians. True, in the given context the black yam reel is featured rather as the fetters of death than "a mytho-poetic symbol of long life".45 Particularly popular with the Tabasaranians is the Al - an evil spirit of perhaps Iranian-Turkic origin.46 In most villages the demon is named Al bab ("Red mother") which is a popular ety- mological interpretation of the Al under the influence of Turkic al "red, pink",47 attested also in Russian. As if to justify its name, Al poses mainly as a female with long loose scarlet hair. Beside the anthropomorphic, Al can also accept a zoomorphic hypostasis and to appear in the form of a red rooster, a fox, a cat, a werewolf (kaftar-janavar) with a single eye in the fore- head, and the like. In a number of cases Al crept into a dwelling in the form of fog which later developed into an evil demon. Assigned as a locus to Al is not a living space, but rather the one assimilated by man: a village and its environs. More often than not Al is surprised in the evening or late at night near a spring at the outskirt of a village or at a river. The demon is unambiguously hostile to man. Its main object of action is a lying-in woman in the first 40 days following the childbirth. Al appears at any time of the day or night provided the lying-in is stay- ing alone in a room, with no men in the house. Assuming the image of a neighbour, a kinswoman, mother, or most often a midwife, Al presents herself to the lying-in asking about her health or offering a treating. As soon as the woman opens her mouth, the demon will grasp her tongue and tear it off with the viscera to sink it in the nearest water fount. If on the way to it the demon encounters a man, Al will go back and replace the organs. If however the demon safely reaches the water, it will submerge the viscera there to rinse them, and then will replace it thus causing the death of the woman. In some cases Al was surprised at the fount while devouring the rinsed viscera. In most cases however it is sufficient to submerge the viscera in the water to cause the death of the lying-in. Therefore, if there is a suspicion or evidence of the demon attacking a woman, the main efforts of her kindred have to be channeled at preventing the viscera from being soaked in water. If prevented, the woman can still be saved. The fear of Al and the injuries inflected by her upon the lying-in, has yielded a number of protective mea- sures. First of all, they plugged the chimneystack which is known to be an "entrance from one world to the other".48 Above the door outside the young mother's room they hanged a naked dagger. Laid at the threshold (boundary between the worlds) were an ax, a chopper, a dagger; strewn on the floor of the room was chicken panic grass,49 burning round the clock in the room was a lamp, put at the head of the bed was a reel of red yarn, a broom, put under the pillow 143</page><page sequence="6">RUSLAN SEFERBEKOV was Qur'an, a knife, scissors, garlic, a needle, sulfur, a twig from a broom. All kind of noise was produced to scare the demon away "(noise, in contrast to silence is the essence of life)".50 To this end they fired the guns, beat the drums, struck the stones, flints, metal objects, knocked at the pans, shook the chest keys, slashed with daggers the water in the founts. As can be seen, summon up against the demon was the whole range of preventive measures. The image of Al is based upon the cult of mother goddess generated perhaps by the Near Eastern influence and had been widely spread among the early land tilling tribes5" and the ancient land tillers of Dagestan."2 In the course of evolution, the image features and functions of the mother goddess were transferred to independent divine images. Re-evaluation of the female patron-divinity of human reproduction with its transformation into the evil demon antagonist of women in labour occurs after the replacement of Matriarchy by Patriarchy as a direct reflection of the social processes within the society and in popular mind.' Belief in the evil spirit antagonist of women in labour also existed among other Dagestanian peoples, as well as in many parts of the world.4 The demon Impersonating diseases The Tabasaranians regard it as a demon impersonating children's skin diseases (rash, sores on the body, head and face of the child). The name of the demon is Meze. It can be either male or female. A child is taken ill with this skin disease at 1, 3 or 7 years of age, if for 40 days after the child's birth his parents had made love or one of them had mounted the roof. Girls suffer that disease for 3 years, boys - for 7 years, then it disappears. There is also a belief that at the new moon the sores are renewed, become larger, and with the ebbing moon get smaller and almost disappear. The anthropomorphic character of this demon, being alternatively male or female, is conjectured, which is confirmed by the data we recorded in village Mezhgyul of the Khiv region in Dagestan. A certain Shikh-Sefer from the Bibabsar tuxum lived here formerly who had been locally canonized for his righteous life. They say that at different times he suc- ceeded in catching two demons, Al and Meze. He cut a pigtail from the former, and severed a finger from the latter, then the two demons pledged their word not to attack his tuxum. Until now the pregnant women fearing to be assaulted by Al and children suffering skin diseases of the Meze type seek help from Shikh-Sefer's descendants. To cure from Meze, a man from that tuxum, having wetted his palm with saliva, passes it on the affected area of the boy's skin. If the patient is a girl, the same procedure is done by a woman from that tuxum. The ritual is accompanied by prayers and obsecrations on the child's recovery. The parents give the heelers small gifts. Thus, we have described the demon of children's skin diseases. Through limited data the object is poorly identified. The personification of diseases is also encountered among the other peoples of Dagestan55 and of the world.`6 Cemetery Demons The cemetery demons, to be discussed below, are depersonified and are summarily named gaytIan, a common denomination of Satan or evil spirit(s), derived from Arabic. His basic functions and characteristics are quite coincidental for the Southern (village Lower Yarak) and Northern (village Kuzhnik) Tabasaranians, which is seen from the texts quoted below: On a Wednesday at night at afresh grave in a cemetery one can see the ?faytlan, that is visi- Hle to man at that mioment. He is wearing a magic hat. The one who wants to possess this cap has to tiptoe to s'uytIan and tear his cap off Having done that, one has to quickly run away from the persecuting demon. He will chase as far as the river (the boundary of th~ worlds,). If you succeed in running ulp 144</page><page sequence="7">ON THE DEMONOLOGY OF THE TABASARANIANS to the river and crossing it, the hat is yoturs. &amp;aytIan fears the water, he will not chase beyond the river If, however, the demon overtakes, he will strike the person a back with his palm. The back will always carry a mark of the demon i palm. It cannot be concealed, not even under iron clothes. In early April, when you see the first swallow, make three steps forward. You willfind a small piece of coal. Pick it up and go to an abandoned graveyard ?aytlan will be seen there. Tear the magic cap off his head, throw the coal at him (a guard) and run back. If the demon does not over- take you by the graveyard boundary, the cap is yours. If he does, he will take the cap back and slaps with all his might on the back with his palm, leaving a mark that cannot be concealed even under iron clothes. Analyzing those data, let us note the time (evening, night) and locus (cemetery) of the demon's existence. The dark time of the night is traditionally associated with raging evil spir- its. The demon is closely associated with his habitat, never trespassing its boundaries. More- over, the demon himself is becoming target of encroachment on the part of man who is trying to seize a magic object - the magic cap the possession of which makes gaytIan related with boggard Rux. The demon will chase the man only to retrieve his magic article. As a punish- ment for trespassing his area and stealing his cap, the demon leaves his sign on the back of the overtaken man - the palm print which also make him related with the depersonalized demons Jinar-geytInar stealing a fetus from mother's womb, who also leave a bloody imprint on the wall as a sign of their visitation. It is interesting to note, e. g., that the Khvarshins had an idea that the boggard Risisan strikes an awakening man with his paw. The place where the paw has been applied will always have decayed clothes: it is as if the man got a mark from the boggard.5S As to another mythological character of the Khvarshins - Lelblbnas igu, mother of disease, there was a belief that whoever she will put her hand on, will become ill the coming spring.58 In contrast to those described above, the next type of graveyard demons bears its own name - Kuruzai (Kuruzan) translated as kuru - "narrow", -zi (-zan) - an anthroponymic suffix. As if to justify its name, Kuruzai poses in an anthropomorphic image, tall, narrow, white-coloured. It dwells at abandoned graveyards. It roams the village in the dark, slamming the shutters, bangs on the windows, scaring the people who lead a sinful life, commit unseemly actions or iniquities. However, occasionally he could scare the righteous villagers as well. Towards morn- ing Kuruzai disappears. It is to be noted that Kuruzai has an analogy in the Russian folklore. V. I. Dahl describes 2erdyai in this way: "...very tall and slim, he will roam the streets sometimes during the night, peeping into windows, warming up hands on chimneys arid scaring people".59 Appearing on the graveyard at night is kaftar-Janavar - a werewolf presented sometimes as a hyena. Perhaps this image is fanned by the Muslim mythology where evil genies appeared "in the guise of monsters and a head of a hyena and wolfs paws instead of the legs". ' In some cases the image of kaftar-janavar with eyes gleaming at night and sparks cascading from his eyes when his teeth are gnashing, can be confused with the image of Kulkaftar - an old hag with gray matted hair also living on the graveyard. Serving as guard against the graveyard demons has been a prayer. Other Dagestanian peoples also have ideas about the graveyard demons: the Lezgins (Malkamut)61, the Laks (Xxurttama)62, the Avars-Bezhtins (Kbav)63 et al. Some demons and evil spirits are known from the terminology used for intimidating children. Related to such are Bubigb(ub) of the Southern Tabasaranians and Biabiu; of the Northern. "Bubigb (Ub) (Biabi- uW) will come" - that was how mothers used to scare their disobedient children in the evening. Through lack of data this character of the Tabasaranians is poorly identified. Instead, the Lez- gins paint Bbugb(ub) in an anthropomorphic form, but havinlg big horns, ears and a tail. He is also used to scare children."4 Similar characters preserved in the expressions used for scaring children are also characteristic to other peoples. Thus, the Dargin-Tsudakharians scare the dis- obedient children in windy weather saying the "?cdurla GIasYura will come." This formula has 145</page><page sequence="8">RUSLAN SEFERBEKOV made available to us the Tsudakharians' image of "Mother of Winds." In the Russian folklore the sham scare for children is buka.6' The West-Europeans use the names Fairy, Browni, Gob- blin." Thus, the described demonological system of the Tabasaranians, though it is incomplete, seems to show the wide range and multiplicity of the mythological characters in the pagan pan- demonium of the past. A further study of pre-Islamic mythological characters of the Tabasara- nians and other Dagestanian peoples is promising within the context of reproducing a more complete picture of the spiritual culture of Dagestan.
