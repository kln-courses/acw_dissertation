<plain_text><page sequence="1">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Volume 72 January-April 1979 Number 1-2 THE RESTING PLACE OF PROCESS THEOLOGY Herbert J. Nelson Canisius College Buffalo, NY 14208 Process theology is generally defended in one or more of three ways. In some cases it is proposed as the only coherent and consistent way to satisfy the requirements of a constructive, systematic metaphysics. In other cases it is presented as the only way to avoid the fatal paradoxes inherent in the classical notion of an unchanging God. In still other cases it is urged as the only view compatible with the God of the Judeo- Christian Scriptures and the Christian religious experience.' The first two considerations quite naturally exercise whatever appeal they have on minds of a certain philosophical bent and background. The third consideration is attractive to a far wider audience. For it seems to rest on a reading of the Scriptures and a lived religious experience shared by large numbers of people with limited philosophical interest or expertise. It is this third consideration which seems to foster an increasing interest in process theology by Christian theologians and by reflective Christians concerned to develop and to spread a better 'John Cobb's A Christian Natural Theology (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1965) relies heavily on the first kind of defense. Charles Hartshorne's many works appeal to the first two kinds, but not-contrary to the sound of certain passages-to the third kind. Cf., e.g., The Divine Relativity: A Social Conception of God (New Haven: Yale University, 1948); A Natural Theology For Our Time (La Salle: Open Court, 1967); and Creative Synthesis and Philosophic Method (London: SCM, 1970). Schubert Ogden's The Reality of God (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1977) appeals to all three, treating the third as independent of the first two. In fact, he sometimes speaks as though classical theology is susceptible to the charge of inconsistency precisely because of its attempt to construct a concept of God which combines the principles of classical metaphysics with the allegedly incompatible scriptural concept of God. Cf., e.g., 65, 140. Cf. esp.: "the classical metaphysical denial that God can be in any sense temporal and relative ... stands in stark contradiction to Scripture's representation of God as the eminent Self or Thou" (p. 65) and also: "Whereas the mythical representations in Scripture having to do with God's own being (say, as the heavenly Father or King) could be accommodated within limits to the God conceived by classical metaphysics, this proved quite impossible in the case of the myths having to do with God's action in relation to the world" (p. 221). Ogden's view seems to be shared by David Tracy (Blessed Rage for Order: The New Pluralism in Theology [New York: Seabury, 1975]), where classical theology is said to be apparently untenable both as philosophical analysis and as an analysis of Christian self- understanding as expressed in its Scriptures. Cf. 147, and also 155, 172, 174, 180-81, 183.</page><page sequence="2">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW understanding of the God in whom they believe. In many cases such people have an interest in philosophy only to the extent that it serves as a vehicle for theological understanding. The thesis of this paper is that the existential needs of a lived Christian experience and the content of the Christian Scriptures do not support a preference for process theology except through the mediation of considerations of the first two sorts. In other words, arguments from Scripture or from the Christian religious experience do not indepen- dently establish a process theology. The preference for a process theol- ogy, if reasonable at all, rests on presuppositions, metaphysical construction, and/ or philosophical criticism not imposed by the Judeo- Christian Scriptures or the Christian religious experience alone.2 A consequence of this thesis is that disagreement as to the relative merits of process theology and classical theology is radically a philo- sophical disagreement rather than a religious disagreement. Accep- tance or rejection of process theology is rooted in philosophical issues relatively remote from the religious message of the Scriptures or the existential experience of the person of faith. There is, consequently, no need for disagreement about the relative merits of process theology and classical theology to be taken as a fundamental difference of personal faiths.3 Defense of the thesis will begin by setting out some representative samples of arguments which purport to show that only a process theology is, and classical theology cannot be, compatible with the God of Scripture or of Christian religious experience. The next step will be to 2The prime targets of the thesis and the paper are certain elements in the work of Ogden and Tracy (cf., e.g., Ogden, The Reality of God, 65, 66, 161). I take Hartshorne to be in substantial agreement with my thesis. And even Ogden and Tracy at times, but not consistently, seem not unequivocally opposed to it. In addition, my target is the strong (but in my judgment unwarranted) attraction which process theology seems to have for many people who are engaged primarily in pastoral ministries. 30gden expects classical theologians to view the assertion of a temporal God as "the denial of essential Christian truth" (The Reality of God, 161). Ogden, however, argues that the temporality of God is an essential Christian truth: "the fundamental insight that God himself is essentially temporal and related to others" is, he says, "the central discovery implicit in the witness of Holy Scripture, and its locus classicus is the Old and New Testaments" (The Reality of God, 161). It is my view that one's affirmation or denial of God's temporality is not determined solely by what the Scriptures say but is rather a function of the presuppositions and conceptions that one brings to one's reading of what the Scriptures say. Denial and affirmation of truth may well be at stake. What is "implicit" (Ogden's word) in Holy Scripture may be at stake. But disagreement about what is implicit is a function of one's interpretive principles, which in this matter carry only the authority of philosophy and not that of Holy Scripture itself. It is therefore either mistaken or misleading to speak of the temporality of God in terms of affirming or denying "an essential Christian truth." 2</page><page sequence="3">HERBERT J. NELSON argue that, if classical theology's account of God is intelligible (i.e., if it can mean what it says), then it escapes the indictment and is fully compatible with Christian belief. Process theology's contention that the classical account is unintelligible will then be shown to rest on unreasonable and arbitrary prejudice if supported only by direct appeal to the Scriptures and/or the ordinary experience of Christians. Finally, it will be argued, the success of process theology's attack on classical theology rests on principles remote from ordinary consciousness, controverted by philosophers, and properly evaluated only by the methods and criteria distinctive of philosophical dialectic. The conclu- sion will be that a preference for process theology over classical theology is not determined by, but instead determines, one's reading of Scriptures and one's interpretation of religious experience.4 I Process theology affirms that God changes. Classical theology affirms that there is no change in God. The God of the Scriptures and of Christian experience is a God of history, a God of love, a God who attaches real and eternal meaning to human beings and actions. On the face of it, then, the God of Christians seems to be radically different from the unchanging God of classical theology in several respects. The Christian God of history makes historical choices, intervenes at particular times and places, is affected by human response to or rejection of divine initiatives, moves to alternative actions when initial interventions and invitations are resisted, enters history in a special fashion through the person Jesus, watches over and guides the people of God. In short, the Christian God of history is in constant interaction with human beings. But such interaction seems both essential to the God revealed in the Scriptures and in Judeo-Christian history and also incompatible with the unchanging God of classical theology. The Christian God of love is deeply interested in human beings, is aware of their every thought and action, is saddened by some and rejoices at others, feels sympathy for the weak and oppressed, is angered by injustice, desires intimate and responsive union with each human person, offers such union through Jesus, continuously renews that offer in the face of each of our refusals and rejections. In short, the Christian God tirelessly and lovingly cherishes us. But such feeling seems both 4Compare this with Ogden's charge that the classical theologian's prejudices against process theology "spring, not from commitment to the understanding of God attested by Scripture ... but rather from the tacit assumption of the premises of classical metaphysics" (The Reality of God, 175). I would not agree that the assumptions are typically tacit, and I would extend the view to apply equally to the process theologian's rejection of the classical view. 3</page><page sequence="4">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW essential to the God revealed in the Scriptures and in Jesus, and also incompatible with the unchanging, emotionless God of classical theology. The Christian God calls us to a life of service, assigns individual and collective responsibilities which cannot be fulfilled by anyone else, insists that each of us has a role to play in building up the Kingdom of God, promises that the least of us is of eternal value, recognizes as ultimately redemptive the actions of Jesus. In short, the Christian God finds real and lasting value in human beings and human actions. But such recognition of human value as real and eternally significant seems both essential to the caring and loving and calling God of the Scriptures, and also incompatible with the exhaustively and unchangingly perfect God of classical theology. Such considerations-only a sample of those which might be offered-show why process theology appeals to an increasing number of Christians as more consistent with the sources and experience of their faith than the classical view which has dominated Christian theology for centuries. Process theology offers a God who interacts historically with individuals and institutions, a God who lovingly feels and sympathizes and cherishes, a God in and through whom the lives and actions of humans can offer contributions of real value and make a genuine and definitive difference. By contrast, classical theology seems to offer a God who stands unchanged and unaffected by the course of history, unable to intervene as the occasion demands, incapable of the emotion and feeling essential to love, and so unchangingly and exhaustively perfect as to leave no room for human lives and accomplishments to have any real value or to make any difference to God. II It is time for a closer look. The obvious may be the deceptive. What grounds would really be sufficient for claiming that the unchanging, absolutely perfect God of classical theology cannot be the Christian God who acts in history, who loves us, and who finds real value in what we are and what we do? Consider first the action of God in history. An action in history seems to be, necessarily, an action that is both contingent upon events that precede it and also intended to affect events that follow it. It thus seems essential to an act in history that it be located in time between earlier and later events, and also that it be contingent upon the earlier ones. But if that is so, then it seems that the actor must, in acting in history, change from some earlier condition of not performing the action in question to some later condition of performing the action, and that this change be at least partly a result of or a response to the earlier events. But then to act 4</page><page sequence="5">HERBERT J. NELSON in history would seem to be impossible for an unchanging and unchangeable God of the sort proposed by classical theology.5 But suppose that there were an agent who knew in advance every event that would occur under every conceivable set of circumstances. Such an agent, foreseeing that certain events would or might occur, might plan and arrange in advance for certain other events to happen when or in case there should arise the conditions introduced by the occurrence of the foreseen events. The occurrence of these prearranged events would then be contingent upon the foreseen events which pre- ceded them, while their occurrence would not entail the occurrence in the prearranger of any change contemporary to the occurrence of the prearranged events themselves.6 Thus, for example, a human being, even without full knowledge of all events that could or would follow, might still plan for certain contingent eventualities, and thus have an influence on events occurring much later, perhaps even long after the death of the planner. From this one may conclude that it is possible for an agent to have an effect upon events occurring at a certain time in history, where the effect is contingent upon events both immediately and remotely preceding it in time and where the occurrence of those effects does not entail some change in the agent simultaneous with the effects themselves. On the other hand, one may also observe that in the case in question the agent's own action is distant in time from the effects which the agent planned and arranged, and that the progression from foreseeing to planning to arranging still seems to entail some change in the agent, even though the change would be at some temporal distance from the effects sub- sequently resulting from it. But suppose further that there were an agent who stood in no 5This is a stronger case against classical theology than process theologians sometimes propose. If, e.g., one accepts Ogden's analysis of God's acting in history, it is not clear that it would require a temporal God incompatible with classical theology. Cf. The Reality of God, 184: ". .. what is meant when we say that God acts in history is primarily that there are certain distinctively human words and deeds in which his characteristic action as Creator and Redeemer is appropriately re-presented or revealed." I intend to show that classical theology can accommodate even the much stronger sense of "act in history" which I have developed in the text-if classical theology's account of God is meaningful at all. 6Process theologians quite often argue against classical theology as though it were proposing a God like the advance planner supposed here. But classical theology's timeless God is radically different from this cosmic advance man, as succeeding paragraphs point out. Cf. Ogden, The Reality of God, 51; Tracy, Blessed Rage for Order, 183. 5</page><page sequence="6">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW temporal relation to any event in time. Suppose, in other words, that there were an agent not in any time and therefore not temporally distant from any event in time. Such an agent would not exist or act before any event, nor after any event, nor in the same time as any event. Such an agent's existence or action would not be temporally distant from nor temporally close to anything. Consequently, no action of this agent could be earlier than or later than or at the same time as any other action of this agent. Nor could any action of this agent be earlier than or later than or at the same time as any aspect of the existence of such an agent. Such an agent, therefore, could not first exist and then later act. Nor could such an agent first act in one fashion and then later act in another fashion. Since, on the present supposition, this agent would have no temporal properties or relations, and since change necessarily involves an earlier and a later, this agent could not possibly change. If such an agent could act in such a way that its actions had effects within our world, then those effects would be located temporally in relation to other things within the world, but would not have any temporal relation to the agent. If such an agent could cause such effects, there is no reason from the nature of the agent why those effects should occur at one time rather than another. But, because of the nature of the temporal world within which the effects would occur, those effects would occur at times consistent with the character of the effects themselves as contingent upon some events and conditioning others. Thus, if there were such an agent, and if such an agent could act so as to affect events within our world, it would be true in a real sense both that that agent could act in history and that that agent would be neither itself in history nor subject to any change in itself because of such action in history. Like the agent in the first case supposed above, this agent's action would not be located in the time(s) when its effects take place. But, unlike the earlier agent, this agent's action would not be remote in time from its effects nor would there be any implication that the agent's action involved any change internal to the agent itself. Since such an agent is just the sort of agent affirmed by classical theology, and since such an agent would be able to act in history and yet not change, there seems to be no reason to claim that the absolutely unchanging God of classical theology cannot be the Christian God who acts in history-unless such an agent cannot possibly exist. That is, given the meaningfulness of the present account of such an agent, there is no reason to claim that either such an agent cannot act in history or it must itself change in doing so. That does not eliminate a very serious and real question, of course. But the real question is not whether such an agent is compatible or incompatible with the Christian belief in a God who acts in history. The real question is whether the account of such an agent is itself meaningful 6</page><page sequence="7">HERBERT J. NELSON and internally consistent.7 The answer to that question is not to be found in Scripture nor in the Christian religious experience. It is to be found, if at all, only in quite rigorous philosophical analysis. As we shall see, it is to be decided on the basis of considerations quite remote from the conscious concerns of biblical writers or the ordinary experience of Christian believers. III Consider next God's love for us. Love seems to involve necessarily an attitude of caring for someone, where one's care is contingent upon a sensitive reading of and response to the desires, needs, and circum- stances of the loved one. It seems impossible to admit that a person could both love someone and also remain unmoved and unaffected by the sorrows and the joys, the failures and the accomplishments of the person loved. To persist unaffected by any changes in the condition of someone is to be indifferent to, not to love, that person. Loving a person may be possible even when one is impotent to do anything for the person loved. But, at the very least, love seems to be impossible in the absence of feelings affected by the changing feelings and conditions of the person loved. But, if that is so, then it seems that the God of classical theology, who would remain unchanged and unaffected by anything that might happen to us, cannot possibly be the God of love spoken of in the Scriptures and experienced by Christians.8 Even as an account of human love, the preceding characterization is imbalanced in at least two respects. First, it emphasizes only the changing character of love, when one of the most remarkable features of genuine love is its constancy, its persistence through joys and sorrows, its stability even in the midst of very intense, shifting, and conflicting emotions. And, second, in that very emphasis on the changing character of love, it treats love as a feeling, or a complex and shifting set of feelings, when in many cases the strength of one's love is measured by its ability to endure and to inspire action in the absence of or even in opposition to one's feelings. There is, then, another story of love to be told, a story of constancy and will, a story that reverses the stress on 7Ogden, of course, charges the classical account with logical inconsistency and incoherence. Cf., e.g., The Reality of God, 17-18. But he considers that fault less important than its "existential repugnance" (cf. 18, 64-65). Cf. Tracy, Blessed Ragefor Order, 180. I do not wish to deny that some people find the classical account of God repugnant. I do wish to argue that, if the account is coherent and meaningful, existential repugnance is unwarranted and unreasonable, and that if it is not, that fault is more radical than such repugnance. XCf. Ogden, The Reality of God, 68; Tracy, Blessed Rage for Order, 161, 189. 7</page><page sequence="8">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW changing feelings, a story that some feel captures more faithfully the essence of love, and, indeed, a story quite consistent with the persistent fidelity of the love of the biblical God. In light of that story, suppose that there were a lover who existed but in no temporal relation to the loved one. Then, even if the loved one existed in time, enduring and enjoying all that humans commonly and uncommonly endure and enjoy, to speak of the lover's love enduring and persisting would be, literally, inappropriate. To speak of such a lover remaining unaffected and unmoved by the experiences of the loved one would be to attribute to the lover just that sort of temporal relation and persistence which it is the point of the present supposition to exclude. Since the supposed lover would not exist in time, it would not be confronted at one time by its beloved in one set of circumstances and at another time by its beloved in a different set of circumstances. It would not be temporally distant from, nor temporally contemporaneous with, any of the circumstances and experiences of the beloved. Unchangingly and unenduringly because literally timelessly, such a lover would be completely appreciative of and responsively devoted to every condition and experience and circumstance of the beloved in one timeless act-all at once. On this supposition, changing and continually adjusting feelings and attitudes are not essential to love, but only to the love of a lover who is neither timeless nor omniscient. On this supposition, if there is change in the love or the lover, it is not because there is change in the beloved, nor because there is love, but because the lover is in time and so must love in the diffuse manner characteristic of temporally extended existents. The lover supposed here would love in the concentrated manner characteristic of non-temporal existents even though the beloved is temporally diffuse. If such a lover were also agent, it would be an agent of just the sort supposed earlier-an agent timelessly acting with the timeliest of effects, unhindered by the dimness of a remembered past or the darkness of an expected but unknown future. Since such a lover is just the sort of lover affirmed by classical theology, and since such a lover would be able to love and yet not change, there seems to be no reason to claim that such a lover could not be, as classical theology contends, the Christian God of love. That is, if there could be such a lover, there is no reason to claim that either such a lover cannot love human beings or it must itself continually change in order to do so. Again, there remains a substantial and real question. But the question is not whether such a love is compatible or incompatible with the Christian belief in a God of love. The real question is whether the account of such a lover is itself meaningful and internally consistent. If 8</page><page sequence="9">HERBERT J. NELSON there were such a lover, it would be compatible with Christian belief. But could there be such a lover? Or is the account merely verbal, lacking in substantive meaning? Only careful, detailed philosophical examination and analysis can move that question forward decisively or at least productively. Such examination and analysis are, quite properly, not intended or offered by the scriptural authors, nor are they part of the ordinary experience of Christian believers. IV Consider finally God's recognition of real value in human existence and action. A person or an action seems to have real value only to the extent that it contributes something not already possessed. If I do something that only duplicates and does not add, I make no meaningful contribution. It would be as though, instead of adding to a manuscript I merely traced over some or all of what someone else has already written. But if there were an absolutely perfect God, a God who exhausts all possible value and perfection, there would be no real value left for us to achieve. Everything worthwhile-absolutely everything-would al- ready be accomplished in God. There would be nothing-absolutely nothing-left that we, individually or collectively, could possibly do or be that would be of any service or value to God, or to anyone else. There would thus be no real meaning or value to human life and activity-only illusory meaning and value, only a tracing and no addition.9 For our lives and actions to have real meaning they must genuinely contribute something to the sum total of value-something not already a part of the values really achieved. So, for our lives and actions to have real meaning, total and absolute value and perfection cannot already exist. Consequently, there would and could be true meaning and value to our lives and actions only if there were no absolutely perfect being already in existence-only if we add something to the limited perfection so far achieved. But if that is so, then it seems that the God of classical theology-a God of absolutely total and exhaustive and unchanging perfection-cannot find any real value in what we are and do, cannot be genuinely served by us, and therefore cannot be the biblical and Christian God who calls us to real service, who finds something of real value in each of us, and who invites us to share in building up the Kingdom of God. The account just proposed is dominated by a peculiar view of the addition or summation of value. It depicts values as though, if there were numerically different but qualitatively identical individuals, the value of such individuals would not be the same. For, according to the view in question, only the numerical first of any qualitatively identical 9Cf. Ogden, 18, 46-48, 50-51. 9</page><page sequence="10">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW individuals could contribute anything real to the summative total of actual value. No actualization or occurrence of any quality would have any value, except in the very first occurrence. Consequently, if there is a God, and if we are to achieve anything of real value, then we must be responsible for the occurrence of some value never yet achieved by anyone else-human or divine. Thus either we can achieve nothing of real value, or there is no absolutely perfect God in whom all values are totally realized.10 There is another account of values-an account dominated by a participative or distributive view. On this other account it is by the qualities of things and persons and actions that their value is determined, so that even if two individuals were only numerically different but qualitatively identical, the second would have as much value as the first, even though the values were of the same kind. On this account, then, an achievement can have value either by being an occurrence of some new quality or by being a new occurrence of some quality already achieved in other instances. Both kinds of achievement are taken to be really valuable, and indeed-contrary to the thrust of the first account-when some novel quality is achieved, it is the quality and not the novelty of its occurrence which primarily determines its value. Thus the achievement of a novel understanding of some physical phenomenon would be recognized as of real value. But so would a student's recreation of that understanding in a physics class have some real value. (If it would not, a defender of this account might ask, of what value would it be for a teacher to try to help students understand what others before them have already understood?) The student's un- derstanding, of course, need not have exactly the same value as the understanding possessed by its originator. For the theoretician's understanding may have qualities in addition to those exhibited in the student's understanding. But if the student understands the theory in question, there must also be some qualitative identity in the two instances of understanding. And insofar as that is the case, both are of equal value and the mere order of occurrence is irrelevant, according to this second acount-though not according to the first. Relying on this second account, suppose there were an absolutely perfect being-a being which infinitely and simply exemplified a perfection of which every finite perfection is a limited and distant '?"Since nothing whatever can make the least difference to such a God, all our strivings and sufferings also must be ultimately indifferent. From the perspective of the Absolute, which alone enjoys ultimate reality, what we do or fail to do can neither add nor detract in any permanently significant way. God's perfection is in every sense statically complete, an absolute maximum, so we can no more increase him by our best efforts than diminish him by our worst" (Ogden, The Reality of God, 51). 10</page><page sequence="11">HERBERT J. NELSON imitation or recreation. Except in terms of limitations, exclusions, and the resultant distinctions between finite values, no finite achievement or occurrence would exemplify any value not infinitely and eminently exemplified by the absolutely perfect being. But, precisely because the values exemplified by these less perfect beings do really-even if in a limited and partial way-exhibit the value infinitely and wholly exemplified in the absolutely perfect being, they are themselves really valuable-even, and indeed especially, from the standpoint of the absolutely perfect being itself. For the absolutely perfect being could fail to appreciate these finite values only at the price of repudiating its own perfection. For, according to the present supposition, those finite values participate in and distribute in their own limited way, and without diminishing their source, the infinite value of the absolutely perfect being. Such a being, therefore, would not only leave room for, but be the exemplar rendering possible the achievement of, real value by human beings. And yet its own absolute perfection would not be subject to change or increase. Since such an absolutely perfect being is just the sort of perfect being affirmed by classical theology, and since such a being would be perfect, independent of change, and consistent with real value in human life and achievement, there seems to be no reason to claim that such a being could not be, as classical theology contends, the Christian God who calls us to a meaningful life and participation in building up the Kingdom of God. That is, if there could be such a being, there is no reason to claim that God must either be limited in perfection or exclude any real meaning or value to our lives. Once again an obvious and serious question remains. But the question that remains is not whether such a being is compatible or incompatible with Christian belief in the meaning and ultimate value of human life and action. The true question is whether the description of such a being is itself meaningful and internally consistent, or meaning- less in its empty self-contradiction. If there could be such a being, it would be compatible with Christian belief in the ultimate meaning and importance of human life. But could there really be an absolutely perfect being? Or are the words strung together in a grammatically proper but semantically self-defeating way? There is no way to settle such a question unless through the patient, and often tedious, analyses that can only (and then not always) excite philosophers. Such analyses would have obstructed the very different purposes of the biblical writers and are not likely to form part of the ordinary experience of a Christian. V The second part of this paper opened with a question. On what grounds might one reasonably claim that the unchanging, absolutely 11</page><page sequence="12">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW perfect God of classical theology cannot be the Christian God who acts in history, who loves us, and who finds real value in what we are and what we do? The general form of the answer to that question has been offered in each of the last three sections. The grounds are not to be found directly in consulting the Scriptures or the ordinary experience of Christians. Instead, one would need to show that the accounts given of an unchanging agent, a timeless lover, and an absolutely perfect giver of meaning to human life are merely verbal and are not really intelligible and meaningful. There is a very tempting and thoroughly inappropriate way to attempt to show those accounts to be meaningless. It is so tempting and so directly in conflict with the thesis of this paper that it must be examined now and in detail before less tempting but more appropriate ways can be productively considered. The notion of a timeless, unchanging, absolutely perfect being is undoubtedly a difficult notion to grasp. Our own experience of action, love, and value is so thoroughly pervaded with time, change, and limitation that it may seem impossible to retain any meaning to the words when so much that is so deeply involved in our ordinary use of them has been excluded. Clearly the notion is constructed to meet the requirements of theoreticians. It is hardly likely that, detached from the theoretical demands which generated it, it could stimulate any existential resonance in the experience of most Christians. It is even less likely that most Christians would appreciate the theoretical context which generated the notion and supplied it with what meaning (if any) it might have. The notion does not, and is not intended to, speak directly to the heart of Christians. Recognition of this persuades some and tempts others to repudiate the notion, and the classical theology to which it is central, as existentially meaningless. The force of this persuasion or temptation is especially strong because of the very large element of truth on which it rests. There is a very real sense in which the notion is existentially meaningless and does not address itself to the full existential reality of the Christian. But, in that sense, all or almost all notions generated to satisfy the demands of sophisticated theory construction are existentially meaningless, i.e., exposure to them does not generally stimulate in the non-theoretician a feeling and appreciation of their meaning proportionate to their genuine importance or meaning in the theoretical context in which they emerge, or even proportionate to the practical implications which they might have. Indeed, sophisticated theoretical notions often seem meaningless in any sense to a person not competent to appreciate either the intellectual problems to which the 12</page><page sequence="13">HERBERT J. NELSON notion offers a solution, or the broader and perhaps more practical implications of the resultant theory.1' Adequate theory must, of course, illuminate the ordinary matrix of common human experience from which it emerges and with which it is continuous. But the adequacy of theory of whatever sort-including theology-cannot be measured by the capacity of non-theoreticians to appreciate the meaning and impact of the theory in their everyday lives. Such incapacity is not even, in general, a relevant measure of the genuine practical import of a theory, much less of its theoretical adequacy. For such incapacity is directly proportionate to the complexity of the theory. And, as Charles Hartshorne observes, "simplicity, while convenient, is if anything a mark of error rather than of truth."'2 "Cf. Ogden, The Reality of God, 190-91, esp.: ... we are impatient with theological statements . . . that do not really mean anything to us at all because they are framed in terms we no longer understand. I do not mean simply that we have become impatient with thejargonistic predilection of the professional theologian. That, unfortunately, seems to be an occupational hazard, which no theologian had better claim to have overcome. What I have in mind is something worse (and there is something worse!) than using technical language in nontechnical contexts-namely, the widespread habit of using the technical or even non-technical language of the church's past to speak to men today in the present. ... one criterion of theological adequacy is that the understanding of faith be formulated "understandably." The theologian defaults in his responsibility if he does not make an earnest effort to state the eternal word of the Christian gospel in a way that will seem both meaningful and true to men who live in the particular time in and for which he has his theological vocation .... Hence what is needed from theology is a thoroughgoing attempt to translate the meaning of the church's traditional witness into terms in which contemporary men either do or can most readily understand their life as human beings. I take there to be a task of the sort which Ogden here describes. I do not take it to be the task of the theologian. It is, I think, the task of the evangelist, the preacher, to translate the Gospel message, i.e., to proclaim it in an idiom intelligible to the audience. The theologian's task is not to translate the message, but to penetrate it-to understand it as well and as deeply as a human can understand it. It is a specialized Christian calling which, of course, has significance and implications for the evangelical task. But the relation of the theologian to the faith community is analogous to that of the scientist to the human community. Nothing would be more destructive of science or more obstructive of its proper contribution to society than to insist that the scientist adopt an idiom comprehensible to all. Something similar is true of theology. Tracy seems to recognize this. Cf. Blessed Rage for Order, 16 n. 9, and 148. But while Tracy speaks of false expectations of theory, as though it can resolve existential or cultural crises, and false expectations of Christianity, as though it can resolve intellectual or cultural crises, Tracy himself, unfortunately, seems to indulge in the false expectation that Scripture will be able to resolve philosophical issues of the sort which divide classical and process theology. On the general issue, cf. also 148. 12Creative Synthesis and Philosophic Method, 267. 13</page><page sequence="14">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW To demand of a theological account that it be existentially meaningful in the sense just considered is simply to impose an alien demand and an unacceptable criterion. It is an imposition comparable to insisting that an adequate astronomy must successfully serve as an aphrodisiac to romantic stargazers, or that scriptural scholars should tailor their accounts of the Scriptures to the devotional needs of evangelical Christians, or that economics should not rest on statistical measures but be governed solely by the average consumer's perceptions of the laws of the marketplace. The non-theoretician may, of course, quite legitimately apply a kind of negative criterion to the works of the theoretician. If a physicist should propose a theory which entailed that bumblebees cannot fly, the non-theoretician might rightly reject it. If the economist argues that the price of bread is inversely proportionate to the price of automobiles, the non-economist might properly disagree. And if the theologian proposes that God cannot act in history, cannot love us, and attaches no significance to us or to what we do, the Christian rightly finds such proposals inconsistent with Christian belief. When a theory is in direct conflict with what the non-theoretician is in as good a position as anyone to know to be true, the non-theoretician may competently issue a negative judgment upon the theory. This is not, however, the position in which classical theology's account of God puts itself. For, as has been seen above, the classical account takes pains to affirm what Christians ordinarily affirm. While the classical notion of a timeless, unchanging, absolutely perfect being may not be imposed by the existential demands explicit in Christian experience, and may not, in the sense presently being considered, be existentially meaningful to an ordinary Christian believer, neither does it conflict existentially with the experience of such a believer in any explicit fashion. And so the negative criterion is not satisfied. The capacity to settle the issue between process theology and classical theology therefore does not lie within the ordinary competence of Christian believers. The issue arises in a theoretical context and must be resolved, if at all, on the basis of the methods and criteria appropriate to that context. VI The argument so far has not attempted to locate the specific philosophical issues in question but has merely tried to defend the general thesis that the existential needs of a lived Christian experience do not support a preference for process theology except through the mediation of constructive and/or critical philosophical theory. The final task is to render the argument more concrete and perhaps more persuasive by identifying some of the crucial theoretical issues on which 14</page><page sequence="15">HERBERT J. NELSON the choice between process theology and classical theology rests. Two examples will achieve this purpose. The process theology advanced by Schubert Ogden in The Reality of God rests on the view that the primal phenomenon is an experience of the self as the ground of the world of perceived objects.13 "As soon... as we orient our metaphysical reflection to the self as we actually experience it, as itself the primal ground of our world of perceived objects," he contends, we recognize that "the very being of the self is relational or social; and it is nothing if not a process of change involving the distinct modes of present, past, and future."'4 Relying on that experience, Ogden adopts the view that any selfs being a self is due to that relatedness and its essential temporality.'5 Ogden then offers that experience as not only revelatory of the nature of a self as such, but "paradigmatic for reality as such"16 and moves immediately to the conclusion that real internal relation to others and intrinsic temporality are not "mixed perfections" peculiar to finite beings such as ourselves, but "simple perfections" inherent in the meaning of "reality" in the most fundamental use of the word. In consequence, the chief category for finally interpreting anything real can no longer be "substance" or "being" (as traditionally understood), but must be "process" or "creative becoming," construed as that which is in principle social and temporal. Whatever is, is to be conceived, in the last analysis, either as an instance of, or an element in, such creative becoming and thus as somehow analogous to our own existence as selves. By this "analogy of being," however, God, too, must be conceived as a genuinely temporal and social reality, and therefore as radically different from the wholly timeless and unrelated Absolute of traditional theism.'7 Ogden's view rests on a series of claims: (1) that each of us has such a primal experience of the self; (2) that, given the experience, it is as Ogden describes it; (3) that that description captures what is necessary and essential to the human self; (4) that it captures what is necessary and essential to every finite self; (5) that it captures what is necessary and essential to every self; (6) that it captures what is necessary and essential to reality as such; and (7) that it therefore captures what is necessary and essential to God. It is not the issue now whether these claims are true or false. But if they are all true, then classical theology's attempt to speak of a timeless divine self cannot make sense, for the meaning of "timeless" would conflict directly with the meaning of "self."

Tracy, Blessed Rage for Order, 181. 15</page><page sequence="16">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW What is pertinent to the present issue is to notice that the truth or falsity of the claims is not determined, nor even relevantly spoken to, by any scriptural passage. On the face of it the idiom and concerns of the claims are as remote from the idioms and concerns of the biblical writers as are those of the classical metaphysics which Ogden is repudiating. The claims are also highly controversial. They take sides on a number of the issues which have been most controverted by philosophers for centuries and continue to be the object of controversy today. Whether Ogden's claims are correct or false or meaningless, they are the outcome, not of his reading of the Scriptures but of what he himself calls "metaphysical reflection,"18 "careful analysis of our experience,"'9 "metaphysical premises,"20 "philosophical interpretation,"2' "philo- sophical theology,"22 and "formal ontological analysis."23 Even Ogden's charges that "traditional theism" is incongruent with, and existentially repugnant to, modern experience of the value of secularity, that it is inappropriate to the scriptural revelation of a personal, loving God, and that it is internally inconsistent and incoherent are not independent of, but crucially dependent upon, the assumptions and conclusions of his "metaphysical reflection." In particular, Ogden's treatment of the criterion of appropriateness to "the witness to God in Christ which is given in Holy Scripture"24 as though it were an additional and independent criterion on the basis of which traditional theism "can only be pronounced inadequate"25 is in fact patently dependent on his analysis of the self's experience and para- digmatic character.26 "If the argument of [Ogden's] essay is correct,"27 then of course it is true, as Ogden says, that a believer should consider classical theism an inappropriate, and process theology an appropriate, theological witness to the God of Jesus Christ. But, first, the argument of the essay is fundamentally a philosophical argument. And, second, if it were correct, it should therefore be accepted by the believer because, as true, it must be appropriate to the biblical witness which the Christian also believes to be true.28 But, third, that is not to suggest that the scriptural I The Reality of God, 57. 9Ibid., 105. 20Ibid., 141. 211bid., 147. 22Ibid., 148. 23Ibid., 148. 24Ibid., 66. 2SIbid., 66. 26Cf. ibid., esp. 66. 27Ibid., 66. 28Cf. Tracy, Blessed Ragefor Order, 135. 16</page><page sequence="17">HERBERT J. NELSON witness itself imposes that argument or independently manifests its correctness. For, fourth, it is also true that, if an opposing argument were correct, then the believer should consider traditional theism the appropriate, and process theology the inappropriate, theological witness. Ogden seems to exemplify more than he realizes the possibility he himself points out: "We may simply read out of revelation a warrant for the conceptions we first had to read into it in order to understand it at all. "29 The lesson to be learned is not that such philosophical analysis should be avoided. Nor is it that one's interpretation of the biblical message should not rest on philosophical analysis. It is perfectly appropriate to bring one's best resources to bear in an attempt to understand, whether the resources be historical, literary, linguistic, or philosophical. What is inappropriate is to seek to invest the philosophical resources one develops or borrows with the normative authority of the message they are used to illuminate. To the extent that one's reading of the biblical witness rests on one's own philosophical analyses and conclusions, one's reading has only the authority of one's own word, not that of the Word of God-however tempting it is to think otherwise. Ogden makes the point in a restricted way against classical theology: "The traditional prejudices against [a frankly 'anthropomorphic' view of God] spring, not from commitment to the understanding of God attested by Scripture (with which understanding, on the contrary, this view is perfectly compatible), but rather from the tacit assumptions of the premises of classical metaphysics."30 Ogden's only mistake is to fail to see that precisely the same is true of process theology and its own philosophical assumptions. VII Consider a final example. One of the most fundamental determinants of Charles Hartshorne's theology is his conviction that "logical and real possibility ultimately coincide."31 This conviction leads him to argue "that a metaphysician . . . must admit that distinctions of logical type have counterparts in extra-linguistic reality."32 This view serves as a warrant to draw inferences from logical structures to ontic structures. One finds such inferences very openly drawn in Hartshorne's defense of some of his most characteristic and influential theological positions. 29The Reality of God, 65. 30Ibid., 175. 3 Creative Synthesis and Philosophic Method, 137. 32Ibid., 142. 17</page><page sequence="18">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Early in The Divine Relativity the key notion, "relativity," is defined as "the ontological correlate of the logical relation of entailment. "33 The central theological application of this is apparent a hundred pages later when Hartshorne says of divine relativity: To ask, is God supremely relative, is to ask, is there any wholly genuine description of him which entails every genuine description of the actual universe? Yes, indeed, if it is genuinely descriptive of him to say that God infallibly knows that that universe exists.34 The application is equally apparent when Hartshorne argues that there are really distinct properties in God, and that these include both necessary and contingent properties: Here are two modally diverse, not logically equivalent, propositions about God, which cannot both be necessary. It follows-I think follows rigorously-that there must be two really distinct aspects of the divine being, supposing God to exist, both of which cannot be necessary, although one of them may be so.35 The force of this view continues to dominate Hartshorne's more recent work on Creative Synthesis and Philosophic Method: . . since in modal logic the purely necessary cannot include the contingent (the conjunction of a necessary truth and a contingent one is contingent), there must be contingency in God if anything in the world is contingent.36 Hartshorne's theology is thus radically dependent on immediate inferences from logical principles to ontological and theological conclusions. But such inference is legitimate only if there is a strict isomorphic coincidence of logical and real structures. And if there is such coincidence of logical and real distinctions, then classical theol- ogy's talk of an absolutely simple but omniscient God cannot make any sense, for knowledge of the contingent states of affairs in the world would conflict with the attribution of utter internal simplicity. A neatly contrasting view is correspondingly fundamental to the classical theology constructed by Aquinas. Aquinas certainly agrees with Hartshorne's view that God is omniscient, and, therefore, that whatever is true of the universe is known by God to be true of the universe. Thus anyone in a position to describe what God knows to be the case would also be in a position to describe every feature of the actual 3 The Divine Relativity, 9. 341bid., 109. 35lbid., 15. Ogden is not explicit about this premise. But he is clearly dependent on it. Cf., e.g., The Realit, of God, 133: "Supposing, then, that its objects are contingent, ... one can hardly deny that even a perfect consciousness would have a contingent or non- necessary aspect." 36Creative Synthesis and Philosophic Method, 265. 18</page><page sequence="19">HERBERT J. NELSON universe. Does Aquinas, then, agree with the conclusion that Hart- shorne's principle generates from such premises, viz., that God is su- premely relative? Aquinas's response is blunt: in Deo non est realis relatio ad creaturas ("in God there is no real relation to creatures").37 Aquinas is not oblivious to the logical relation between the terms "knowing" and "being known." He points out himself that scientia ad scitum relative dicitur ("Knowledge is said relatively to being known").38 But he is also convinced that the logical distinctions and relations characteristic of human discourse do not necessarily reflect real relations and distinctions in the realities of which we speak, even when the realities of which we speak are human or finite. In fact, logical distinctions, Aquinas seems to think, do not in general entail corre- sponding real distinctions, even when there happen to be correspond- ing real distinctions. The clearest indication of this is perhaps in Aquinas's view of affirmative predication: In qualibet propositione affirmativa vera, oportet quod praedicatum et subjectum significent idem secundum rem aliquo modo, et diversum secundum rationem ("In every true affirmative proposition the predicate and the subject must signify in some way the same thing in reality, and different things in idea").39 Later in the same article Aquinas specifies: Huic vero diversitati quae est secundum rationem, respondet pluralitas praedicati et subjecti; identitatem vero rei significat intellectus per ipsam compositionem ("The plurality of predicate and subject correspond to this diversity in idea, while the intellect indicates the identity on the part of the thing through their composition").40 So, far from agreeing with Hartshorne that logical distinctions reflect real distinctions, Aquinas holds that truthful affirmative predication is impossible without divergence between the logical distinction of subject and predicate and the real identity signified through the joint operations of their logically distinct functions. It is this general distinction between logical diversity in the way humans affirm and real identity in what they truly affirm to which Aquinas appeals in denying that some real diversity in God corresponds to the multiplicity of predicates affirmed of God. 37Summa Theologiae, 1.28.1 ad 3. 3TSumma Contra Gentes, 2.11. 39Summa Theologiae, 1.13.12. This translation is that of Henry F. Tiblier, S.J., in his translation of Peter Hoenen, S.J., Reality and Judgment According to St. Thomas (Chicago: Henry Regnery Co., 1952) 75. Hoenen's entire chapter on "The Structure of the Proposition in General" (73-94) is a helpful discussion of certain of Aquinas's views on the relation between logical and real structures. 40Summa Theologiae, 1.13.12. 19</page><page sequence="20">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Quamvis autem intelligat ipsum [Deum] sub diversis conceptionibus, cognoscit tamen quod omnibus suis conceptionibus respondet una et eadem res simpliciter ("Although one understands God in terms of diverse conceptions, one knows, however, that a reality which is simply one and the same corresponds to all its conceptions").41 Hartshorne and Aquinas thus take sharply opposing views of the principle that logical distinctions exhibit real distinctions. And this difference is fundamental to the divergence of their theologies. It is of no importance here to determine who is correct. The relevant point is that the issue is not helpfully resolved or even moved forward by considering whether one position is more existentially repugnant to Christians than the other. The issue is hardly at the forefront of ordinary Christian experience. Nor could even the devil have much success in finding some clear, unequivocal, and explicit scriptural basis for preferring one view to the other. It is just the kind of issue to which no one but a philosopher gives any thought. It is just the kind of issue that is resolved, if at all, only in the course of developing a dialectically adequate theory of the relations between logic and ontology. It is just the kind of issue that ought not be resolved by appeal to, nor made a test of, one's Christian faith. It is just the kind of issue, in other words, where one must accept responsibility for one's own words rather than attempt to cloak them with the authority of God's Word. VIII The time for summary and conclusion is long overdue. Process theologians seem often to succumb to a paradoxical pair of temptations to which classical theologians have themselves never been immune. They are the peculiar occupational hazards of the Christian theologian, it seems. One attaches such authority to the product of one's own effort to understand that one makes acceptance of it a test of everyone else's Christian faith. Since, however, one cannot admit such arrogance to oneself, one is drawn to identify the words of one's human theology with the authoritative Word of God, thus preserving one's conscious humility as the vehicle for arrogantly rendering one's own words effectively normative. The enormous and often bloody consequences of such confusion of theology with faith are well known. Specifically, process theology is sometimes defended by arguing that, unlike classical theology, it is compatible with the God of Scripture and Christian religious experience. Classical theology is sometimes attacked by process theologians on the grounds that it is existentially meaningless and even repugnant to Christian believers. 4'Ibid., 1.13.12. 20</page><page sequence="21">HERBERT J. NELSON The argument here has been that the choice between process theology and classical theology does not, and should not be thought to, turn on such considerations, which tend to couch the disagreement between the two theologies as though it were a religious disagreement, a disagree- ment in faith. Instead, it has been shown, the crucial differences are in difficult areas of philosophical principle and theory, and should be evaluated and resolved through application of the dialectical methods characteristic of philosophy. The true debate, then, is which is more reasonable in light of the criteria generally relevant in philosophy. The question is not which is more Christian, except insofar as, in the end, a Christian is called to be an autonomously reasonable person. Process theology, like classical theology, rests finally on claims which have no more authority than the reasons which can be advanced in their support, and which are quite remote from the ordinary consciousness of the Christian believer. To free philosophy from the Bible is also to free the Bible from philosophy. It is a relief to the philosopher and even more to the non- philosopher to recognize that God does not work salvation through philosophical dialectic. But it is also a challenge to the philosopher and the theologian. For to see that dialectic is not God's instrument for salvation is to see not only its limited importance, but our own autonomous responsibility for its products.42 42This paper rests in great measure on research and reflection made possible by a sabbatical leave and a Faculty Fellowship funded by Canisius College. 21</page></plain_text>
