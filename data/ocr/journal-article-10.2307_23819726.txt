<plain_text><page sequence="1">1 CONCERT PARTIES IN NORTHERN GHANA: HOW UNPOPULAR IS POPULAR CULTURE?1 CESARE POPPI In its analytical formulation, the problem that will be discussed in this paper concerns what recent research in the growing field of cultural studies and anthropology terms 'popular culture' in urban, or 'urban like' African settings. I wish to ask whether the concept is more or less helpful when trying to articulate the complexities, internal ruptures and decalages to be encountered and confronted in understanding certain contemporary cultural developments, with specific reference to rural Northern Ghana. The ethnographic material will be provided by my own fieldwork and direct experience of the Upper West Region in Northern Ghana on the one hand, and by supplementary material recently featured in Ghanaian newspapers on the other. In the matter of ethnography, I will have to resort to a modicum of arguably unorthodox self-reflection, for which I apologise in advance. 1 - Culture as Performance: some problems and issues The occasion for thinking about such matters was a conference organized in Amsterdam by the Afrika Studie Centrum in June 2002. Under the title 'Performing Culture: the politics and aesthetics of cultural expression in contemporary Ghana', the conference presented an engaging cross-section of the state of popular culture in contemporary Ghana. This ranged from Highlife music and the visual media to the dominance of Ghanaian - actually Akan - symbolism in the African diaspora to the revival of local festivals alongside the development of tourism and such like matters. The present essay is the result of a seminar I was kindly invited to deliver at the African Studies Center of the University of Cambridge in November 2002. While the usual disclaimer applies, I wish to thank the seminar participants for helping me to realise that some, at least, among my thoughts ought to have been kept private, while others needed reworking. I wish to thank especially Susan Drucker-Brown, Eugene Mendonsa and Ato Quayson for doing so in a graceful manner. Cambridge Anthropology, 23: 2, 2003</page><page sequence="2">2 Cesare Poppi Two seemed to be the unifying features of the event - the first theoretical, the second, strictly linked to the former, of a more ethnographic nature. The overall methodological and theoretical framework of the majority of the papers followed in the wake of cultural studies, rather than the more habitual anthropological or sociological thrust of Ghanaian studies. For that reason alone - and I am not trying to be ironic here - the conference certified that Ghanaian studies are not only well acquainted with the cutting edge of academia, but also - paralleling the fortunes of what has been called 'the contemporary Ghanaian renaissance' - lead the trend. This, in terms of the development of ethnography as an intellectual endeavour, has two important implications. The first is that 'culture' is understood in terms of 'performance', consciously and deliberately 'acted out' and made explicit. Classic anthropological models were more inclined to consider culture a component of 'the unconscious' or, at least, of the unreflected, implicit and 'structural' (e.g. Douglas 1975), but the entire project of structuralism, mutatis mutandis and admittedly problematically, was also like-minded. From this there follows a second implication. By virtue of their performative nature, cultural expressions are 'mediated' - in the literal sense of being 'acted through media'. These can be of a technological kind (video, cinema and television) or of the longer established types which cover bodily techniques such as dance and other set sequences of actions hitherto known as 'ritual'. Since its very inception in the work of Richard Scheduler and his school (e.g. Schechner 1988 and 1989; Thompson Drewal 1992) - and I leave Victor Turner out of this deliberately - the concept of performance has been connected to that of culture. The articulation of culture as/and performance is set in a guise that makes of the former an objectified, when not altogether reified, 'text' - or 'discourse' in the theoretical vocabulary of some scholars - which it is the task of performance 'to express' and make available to perception as an 'external' event. While most scholars would today agree that culture is notoriously - and increasingly more so - an intractable, fuzzy concept, the view of culture as performance lends yet more legitimacy to an all too Hegelian view of the concept as a sort of self-aware and self-asserting Volkgeist. Though this might be in line with a politically correct, self-reflexive attitude whereby culture is what its actors perceive to be and perform, yet it does little to dispel the suspicion that cultural studies objectify culture as a 'thing out there' rather than 'in here', something which is the task of performative action to bring to fruition through this or that medium and the (by now marginal, accessory and subjective) task of the anthropologist merely to interpret.</page><page sequence="3">Concert Parties in Northern Ghana 3 It is not surprising, therefore, that some of the most interesting and successful studies to come out of the 'culture and performance' approach have focused on those phenomena which are most readily treated like texts. These are then analysed as encoding in their formation - and then expressing in their performance - certain 'cultural discourses'. Such is the case - for instance - of Karin Barber's work on Yoruba Oriki songs and popular theatre (e.g. Barber 1991; Barber, Collins and Ricard 1997). Following in the same furrow, her school has produced some of the most interesting products in the growing field of cultural studies as literary criticism, increasingly more effective in the context and with the theoretical backing of what is known as 'postcolonial theory' (e.g. Newell 2000). It must be acknowledged that the growing field of studies of what is termed 'popular urban African culture' has contributed much to the understanding of certain dominant trends. Also, there is no denying that the 'culture as performance' approach is justified - in the first instance - in rem. This is because 'culture' is, in many respects, or has become historically, very much a reified concept. This especially in a context such as modern Ghana where social actors themselves perceive something 'out there' as 'our African culture' against something else which African culture is not. In such a situation, it is at least partially legitimate to focus on 'culture' as representation and performance if only because 'culture' is much about representing and acting out. However, the problems begin when scholarly reflection stops at the positivistic stocktaking of 'what really exists'. When scholars fall short of asking why it should be that what is perceived as 'culture' at 'the popular' level is thus historically reified, textualized, represented and mediatized. Asking such questions implies reviving the fundamental and nearly forgotten issue of the 'disembededness' of culture - as Alan Scott did quite recently reflecting on the limits of globalization (Scott 1997). Karl Polanyi and other scholars of an historical materialistic persuasion saw this as one of the defining traits of modernity. We would require a two-layered metatheory of culture capable of articulating the performative and the explicit with the implicitly normative and unconscious in terms of the historical emergence of an objectified domain of 'culture' alongside a - as yet unselfconscious - domain 'Other than culture'. However, within the confines of the present paper, the preliminary question is why should it be that 'culture' - or, rather, some selected and self-conscious components of a much wider, deeper and ominously unselfconscious formation - has become disembedded from the social domain as to become 'texts' available to be reproduced in 'performance' and represented via the media? This question is all the more crucial for African contemporary culture in that the very fact of positing it as a</page><page sequence="4">4 Cesare Poppi question forces into the open the related issue of what should or should not be acritically performed as 'popular culture' on the contemporary African stage. The animated discussion that followed the presentation of one crucial paper at the Amsterdam conference revolved precisely around such issues. The paper by Birgit Meyer 'Fighting the Devil on Screen: Ghanaian videofilms and the representation of local religious traditions' was intended as a visual corollary to Birgit Meyer's work: Translating the Devil: religion and modernity among the Ewe of Ghana of 1999. Like many successful books, Meyer's succeeded in voicing - and framing in good ethnographic detail - a number of concerns which had been slowly taking shape within the scholarly community in the last decade or so. The question that Meyer asks of her ethnography is one that has puzzled foreign Christian missionaries ever since the beginning of what I have called 'Africa's biggest industry' (Poppi 1998). Why is it that, in spite of Christianity's insistence - in all its numerous brands - on the One and Only God, the gods of old keep resurfacing not only as independent agents of autonomous cults, but also - and most worryingly - from within, as it were, as a negative counterpart to the positive forces of Christianity. Meyer's answer is that the success of the various brands of Evangelical and Pentecostalist independent churches is largely predicated on the fact that their theodicy allows - and actually fosters - the enduring presence of traditional 'Pagan' deities as agencies of evil. This Meyer sees as a specific, if not exclusive, feature of the 'failure to deliver' on the process of modernization: Christianity came associated with the promesse de bonheur of early phases of the process of modernization. This proved problematic and disappointing, the gods of old are endorsed with the power to scupper the faithful's progress with their false promises and deceptions - all the more powerful and active the more problematic modernity proves to be (Meyer 1999). The contemporary success of newly born local fundamentalist churches - whether of the Evangelical or Pentecostal branch - over older mission-based churches, rests - at least in part - on their willingness to accommodate native agencies as part and parcel of the worldview of their converts. Early 'official' Christianity saw in the 'gods of old' little more than 'primitive superstitions', and in the stubborn refusal of Christian converts to give them up, a question of 'civilization' rather than apostasy to be overcome by the wider process of inculturation enshrined in colonialism. The new brands, on the contrary, take the persistence of the gods seriously, as evidence of the active presence of the Devil on the one hand, and of the weak response of altogether too easily seduced Christians on the other. This process is by no means a specific result of 'modernity' and of the specific dynamics it acquires on the African continent. Rather, it</page><page sequence="5">Concert Parties in Northern Ghana 5 describes historically recurrent structural faults, endemic to the predicament faced by any religion of salvation in justifying the presence of evil in the world. As Valerie Flint has shown in her brilliant study of early Christian attitudes towards magic, the original attitude of the new establishment was one of staunch 'rationalism' vis-a-vis the world of necromancy, magic and - by extension - 'the gods'. Early attitudes favoured a sort of 'enlightened', mildly mocking and occasionally bemused stance towards practices and beliefs perceived —with the optimism of the new religion statu nascenti - as doomed to melt away in the light of the new worldview (Flint 1991). Paradoxically though, it was precisely the emergence of the Christian Church firstly as the dominant, and later as the hegemonic religious power in the presence of the enduring persistence of 'Pagan' practices and beliefs that - slowly but inexorably - forced a change of tack. Faced with the enduring presence of 'magic' as well as with the 'survivals' of the Pagan gods, the Church began to treat both as entes realissimi. Beginning in around the V or VI century, they started to be countered by a kind of 'positive magic' of which the Church now claimed the exclusive monopoly, while the symbolic elaborations stemming from non-official, unassimilated practices, began to be subsumed in the doctrine of diabolical heresy and Devil-worship eventually leading to the witch hunts of the XIII century (Ginzburg 1989). Such dynamics are therefore both case-specific and structural, fostered by intrinsic, cross-cultural and historically recurrent cognitive contradictions inherent in the nature of representational activities on the one hand (Goody 1997) and the specific conditions under which they become articulated and entangled on the other. In my experience in the field of rural Northern Ghana, 'modernized', mainstream Christianity - the type of confessions that have had to confront Darwin and the Enlightenment - faces an apparently insoluble dilemma when dealing with 'local gods' and beliefs. I recall the tremendous, impotent embarrassment with which Roman Catholic missionaries attempted to deal with the all too numerous cases of 'diabolical possession' that their flock regularly laid at their door. On one occasion, a frustrated European missionary at the end of his tether complained to me about the fact that the people of his parish were 'so primitive' as to still believe in the Devil. After some thoughts, he added: 'I also do not believe the Devil to be so stupid as to waste time in this place'. Pointing out, on such occasions, that to deny the existence of the Evil One would have not gone down well with the Church's dogma, fostered further embarrassment and confusion and what - in anthropologically former times - would have counted as a remarkable, if</page><page sequence="6">6 Cesare Poppi instinctive, functionalist insight into the matter: 'Are you implying, then - a missionary friend snapped at me once - that I am to believe that any woman who convulses on the ground with foam at her mouth every time her co-wife is given meat to chop by her husband is possessed by the Devil?!'2. Much of the struggle for converts between competing confessions is fought precisely along the structural fault lines of the rationality of beliefs and their translation into the idiom(s) of Christianity. What for old professional, hardened and largely sceptical Roman Catholic missionaries are - albeit intractable - 'old women's tails', for the young, enthusiastic visionary volunteers of the Evangelical churches operating in Northern Ghana are 'the real stuff' of missionwork, its hard targets, as it were. Promoting a radically uncompromising brand of Evangelism, the missionaries of the World Evangelical Church in Northern Ghana have no hesitations in grouping all extant indigenous practices related to shrines, masks, divinatory practices - the lot - at the negative pole of Christianity. In the area where the Sigma shrine and initiation society of masks is operating, the resident European Roman Catholic missionary once told me with genuine longing that he hoped, before long, to have the masks of the Sigma society dancing for the entertainment of worshippers outside his church after midnight mass on Christmas Eve. The subtle cultural policies pursued in the British Isles by Augustine of Canterbury in the VI century, cut no ice with his WEC colleague - a preacher from Central Australia. At the time of my fieldwork in 1995 he was going round the villages where the Sigma cult was practiced telling people that, since Sigma masks featured horns, and so did the Devil, then Sigma was the Devil. When I confronted him about creating trouble by means of his ill-conceived equivalencies between perspective young converts and the elders of the Sigma society in the district, he reiterated his convictions and took no notice. Later, my argument that cows too carried horns but were neither the Devil nor Sigma, was met with the answer, by a young WEC catechumen, that: 'OK, you may be right, but cows are not as powerful as Sigma, though the Devil is'. Argument lost! It must be stressed that, in my experience, such attitudes are more characteristic of Roman Catholic expatriate missionaries operating 'on the ground', as it were, than they are of their Ghanaian colleagues and, especially, of 'official' theological views about witchcraft and related cultural domains. The end result is that of a gap, occasionally conflict and certainly embarrassment at the contradictions between 'field missionaries' inclined to see in certain practices little more than 'superstition' to be eradicated by 'development' and the official positions which tend to perceive them as 'the work of the Devil'.</page><page sequence="7">Concert Parties in Northern Ghana 7 According to Birgit Meyer - and the kind of these that after the publication of her work has become common currency - that type of cultural logic favours the permanence of 'traditional' gods and supernatural agencies amongst the Ewe of Southern Ghana as well as elsewhere in Africa. Seen as the administrators of misfortune, the gods of old find a new, powerful raison d'etre as players in the new symbolical field laid out by Pentecostalist Christianity and the like. The failed promises of modernity work as fuel to inject new "energy into the explanation of misfortune as the work of the 'traditional' gods. The less modernity delivers, the more 'the gods' are seen as active. One cannot win: the more people fail in achieving their desiderata, the more their failure is seen either as induced by apostasy in favour of the Devil in the disguise of the old gods, or as a deliberate attack by the same agents in order to carry away another soul. At the Amsterdam conference, Birgit Meyer showed excerpts from popular Ghanaian videos which gave specific visual form to this kind of cultural logic. In a paradigmatic example of 'culture represented and performed', the 'spirit' of a certain plot concerning diabolical possession was given the small size and oriental attire of a eunuch/Aladdin. Likewise, along the same line of aesthetic elaboration, the episode of vanquishing the diabolical character in the drama was rendered in terms of the 'fetish house' going up in flames, smoke and explosions - a local version of special effects a la Spielberg. It was the ensuing discussion that set the problematic terms of the debate - and brought to light the shortcomings of the 'culture as performance' approach. A small but articulate group of Ghanaian scholars, both students and expatriates, led by the poet, writer and radical cultural commentator Atukwei Okai, objected to the presentation of the video as 'popular culture' on two fundamental grounds - one of merit and another of substance. On the issue of merit, as a work of art, Professor Okai objected that the video - and much 'cultural production' of that type - was absolute rubbish, and that scholars should take a more pro-active (and less 'positivistic') stance by denouncing the sad state - on all accounts - of the Ghanaian film industry. Secondly, in terms of the substance of the work, Okai attacked the assumption, fostered in his view by the author of the movie, that what was being represented as the work of the Devil was 'traditional African culture'. He found that creeping suggestion offensive and untrue - the result of centuries of misrepresentation which have vilified and criminalized 'traditional' African culture in a way that was - in his view - unacceptable and in need of demystification. This - Okai said - scholars ought to contribute to do by subscribing to - and taking seriously, the educational mandate of their profession. Endorsing such cultural industry with the scholarly blessing of representing</page><page sequence="8">8 Cesare Poppi 'popular culture' was sending out the wrong message, and undermined the effort 'to enlighten' the masses towards progress, development and a better future. I cannot describe the debate that followed, nor do I intend to discuss in detail Professor Okai's stance - whose worth as well as limitations I can see and share. What I want to do, rather, is to substantiate ethnographically some of his insights. These are informed, it will be argued, by an accurate - if critical - perception of the complex dynamics currently faced by Ghanaians in the attempt to come to terms with, negotiate and accommodate the more problematic aspects of what 'modernity' and its agents have made 'African traditional culture' to be in the eyes of its very practitioners and creators. 2 - Performing 'magic': konsah in Northern Ghana 'Concert Parties' are as popular in the rural North of Ghana as they used to be in their heydays in the coastal South. The Concert Party - konsah in the North - is a typical Ghanaian genre whose fascinating history has been recently expounded in a book by one of the pupils of Margaret Thompson Drewal (Cole 2001). The entertainment genre of the concert party, described by Catherine Cole as a paradigmatic example of both colonial and postcolonial popular culture, is rooted in early XX century theatrical performances by groups of travelling entertainers, doubling up as comedians, singers and musicians. In their early formulations, concert parties exploited the novel situations and social contradictions of the colonial encounter pitching White Man's mores and customs against the risible attempts by the local elites to appropriate them as a means of upward social mobility. In its classic, mature form of the 1920s and 1930s, the concert party alternated songs, satirical sketches, monologues and highlife music in a dazzling, fast sequence of apparently unrelated pieces. These combined elements from Akan folklore - such as the stories of Anansi - with satirical skits about Liberian Kru harbour labourers and local adaptations of Charlie Chaplin's most popular sketches blended with elements developed in the tradition of American minstrelsy. Flexible and open to improvisation, the Concert Party relied heavily on daily events and town gossip to strike a blow at pretentiousness and 'modernity'. 'Modernity' here must be understood chiefly as the clumsy attempt to be what one is not, cannot - and should not be. According to Catherine Cole, this specifically Ghanaian form of vaudeville came to an end in the 1990s, with the mass diffusion of</page><page sequence="9">Concert Parties in Northern Ghana 9 television and the transferral of some of the dramatic strategies of the Concert Parties to TV shows and soap-operas. While Cole's analytical reconstruction of the history of the Concert Party stops at the mid-1960s, her account does not touch upon a specific development of the Concert Party which makes it - still - a viable form of entertainment especially in the rural areas of the deep North of the country. When I was engaged in my early fieldw'ork in the mid-1980s, I occasionally came across travelling lorries covered in brightly painted tarpaulins advertising Concert Parties of a sort. Those were the days when the Ghanaian economy was at its lowest ebb, and no 'urban-style' entertainment of any kind - cinema, television or what else - was available. I never had the opportunity to investigate what precisely the concert party lorries which I met on the dusty roads were about, but I recall being struck by the bloody, gory type of imagery that they exploited for their publicity. A concert party advertisement invariably showed multi-headed, multi-limbed, multi-fanged, cannibalistic monsters busy dismembering, disembowelling and variously cooking, chopping, torturing and gnawing young women - possibly scantily dressed - in a pool of blood and amidst onlooking snakes, gigantic insects and similar monsters. The Akan proverbs accompanying the images and the references to Sasabonsam - the hideous forest spirit of Asante folklore - certified that the concert parties travelling to the North were from the South somewhere - or at least that they exploited the pan-Ghanaian knowledge of Akan lore. Invariably, Sasabonsam appeared either in the features of a 'White Man-type' devil, or, which amounts to more or less the same, in the guise of the pan-West African type of the so-called 'firespitter' mask of the Poro secret society of the Senufo, in Ivory Coast - the 'kpelige', or 'kponyungo'. The latter constitutes by now the shared imagery of the Devil for Muslim, Christians and 'traditionalists' alike. As such, it features as the Devil torturing unfaithful wives in the other world in widely distributed leaflet illustrating the wages of sin (Kirby 1986, plate 42). While this type of iconography stretches across the spectrum of religious allegiances, it has - most crucially - come to incorporate the grey, fuzzy area set in the triangle formed by the two Religions of the Book and whatever 'local tradition' they have impacted on to in West Africa, to the point of being immediately recognizable by all concerned as the very face of Evil. I finally had the chance of finding out more about konsah in late February 1985. At the time I was staying at the village of D., located at about twenty miles of badly worn bush track from the market town of K. - and its Catholic and WEC missions.</page><page sequence="10">10 Cesare Poppi Rumours began to circulate about a konsah coming to K. People in the village began to talk about it in excited terms, and the youth especially seemed to be very keen on attending. But things were not all fine and smooth. I became aware that, on the side of the elders - and especially of the village chief, a devout Muslim genuinely, if forcibly rather ineffectively, committed to village development - there was a growing opposition to people participating in the fun. My investigations with my friends did not sort out much as to why the elders were so opposed to villagers attending konsah. All I got were vague replies about youngsters 'roaming' and women 'wasting time and money' and 'finding lovers'. Of the show, it was said that it was about unspecified 'bad things' - a euphemism most often used for witchcraft, but not exclusively - and whatnot. All of this - for lack of better evidence -1 put down to the ingrained conservatism of the elders trying to suppress novelties in whatever form they presented themselves which had been - instead - in much evidence during the first phase of my stay in the village. Meanwhile, the day of konsah approached. It came to coincide with the market held in K. on Wednesdays. I decided to go and see what was happening. On my way to the market, I was struck by the number of people I met on the road to K.: many villagers from D. had walked the previous day to S., a large village on the way to K., where they slept ready to jump on two tractor trailers that had been sent to pick people up in the early morning. Two young men were balancing precariously on the load carrier of my motorbike, and we met many more marching gingerly towards K. in the early morning mist. In K. the atmosphere was vibrant, excited. There were many more people milling around than usual on market days, and the focus of the action seemed to be a large compound just off die main market square where - we were told - konsah would start at sunset. On the edge of the market I met T., a well-travelled and highly educated school headmaster friend of mine. He was also the powerful local Roman Catholic European missionary's most trusted catechist, the President of the Credit Union and the leader of the Parish Council. When I spoke to him about the coming konsah, he became very upset and angry. 'Luckily for these bad people - he said - Father has travelled to Accra, otherwise he would not leave them!'. 'Why would Father not leave them?' -1 asked. It was there and then, at Mister Opoku's akpeteshie bar, that the nature of the success of konsah amongst the people of the North became clear to me. T. explained that the core, the most popular part of konsah, was not so much the music and songs - which, in the case of this particular group of performers, were rubbish anyway. People came from far and</page><page sequence="11">Concert Parties in Northern Ghana 11 wide to witness the sequence of what he described as crude, basic and not so skilfully executed 'conjuring tricks' set at the heart of the performance which began at around midnight and went on till daybreak. The highlight of the konsah performance on that night, it had been announced, would be the killing, disembowelling and resurrection of a young woman. Tomorrow, the same woman would be decapitated, her head set on a table and people could go and ask her what appeared to be divinatory, oracular questions on- any matter of their concern whatsoever, it had been guaranteed. T. - somewhat disheartenly - went on narrating how, years and years ago, when Father L. and Father J. - his good mate - were still at the mission of N., further south, a similar event had happened, but with very different consequences from tonight's. On hearing that 'the Head' had been set on the table somewhere in the village, and that people were flocking to the oracle, Father J. had gone into one of his famous rages and charged down from the mission house into town. Wading his way through the crowd, he had entered the oracular shrine. Cries, I-beg-yous and altercations had been heard inside - and then this young woman was seen rushing out, precariously balancing a table, covered with a long, blood-stained cloth, set through a hole around her neck, with Father J. in hot pursuit trying to reach and kick her with his famous army boots. The konsah people had left N. in a hurry, and had not been seen there for a long time. Now they were back - T. concluded disconsolately - and villagers were once again flocking to them, forgetful, ready to be duped and robbed of their money again. And Father J. had gone to Accra. At dusk the atmosphere in the crowded compound was electric, overexcited. The courtyard was packed to the brim, with people peering down from the rooftops and children filling every available space. A noisy generator fed a couple of oversized amplifiers blasting away highlife and other musical entertainment. When it eventually failed - or was it that the organizers where trying to save fuel? - a rather tired, dishevelled group of performers played a few skits and sang a few songs, often repeating themselves to meet demands from their audience. I was sitting in the less conspicuous, least lit part of the arena, and ended up - like many - dozing off as I was awaiting the core event. As midnight approached, the leader of the konsah performed a series of conjuring tricks with cards. These nobody could possibly follow in any detail if simply because, by then, the only illumination was provided by a Tilley lamp a substantial part of whose mantel was missing. From what I could figure out, half the tricks were botched anyway, while the other half was wasted on an audience who found it</page><page sequence="12">12 Cesare Poppi hard, for lack of familiarity, to anticipate what wonders were supposed to happen and therefore appreciate the show. Finally, a young woman was carried on stage, set on a table and pronounced dead by the konsah leader and chief magician. Her limp arms and legs were raised alternately and dropped heavily. This was to show - it was explained - that the girl was actually dead, and not just sleeping. Why we were spared the much-publicized 'killing' of the girl, I cannot tell - only I was grateful, though my fellow-spectators showed some disappointment. The audience fell into a deadly silence when it was announced that the woman was presently going to be disembowelled. A sheet was drawn across the body and kept raised as a kind of screen by two assistants. The magician got to work behind it, and soon blood was dripping all over the table. The crowd held their breath. Then, suddenly, the curtain was drawn and a tangle of entrails, intestines and organs of a sort was revealed lying cross the woman's middle body. 'Now' - the conjurer leader solemnly announced - 'Now we are going to look for somebody to inspect the body and certify that - yes! - the woman has in fact lost her intestines!'. Tension became tangible as he scanned the darkness, looking for his witness. Cowering in my dark corner I felt secure: 'It will certainly be an accomplice, a fix...' I told myself, hopeful. Not so: a second later a cheer surged from the crowd and carried me forth towards the focus of the action: 'How on the b y earth can these b....y crooks see in the darkness!?' - I thought, dejectedly. 'The obroni down there!' - cried the konsah leader - 'The White Man down there will hereby certify with immediate effect, to all and sundry, that this woman has truly lost her intestines!'. I did not know which way to turn. I was angry, tired and pissed off. The temptation to give the game away - never mind the consequences of my action - was great. The feeling of being abused to validate a spectacle which was both lousy and cruel to the people with whom I was living was also great. But then, as I was urged to plunge my hand in the mass of bloody, squishy and by then rather smelly entrails, the awareness grew that the expectations of the expectant crowd were such that any 'wrong verdict' on my side would have resulted in violence - and more against me as a 'konsah party pooper' than against its perpetrators as cheats. Still I could just not let it go like that. I took my time and even tickled the girl's tummy to the point of making her giggle. The magician became alarmed. 'Hey, my friend' - he said - 'hey, my friend, what are you doing!?' 'My friend' - retorted I - 'what are you doing?'. The mood in the compound was one of tangible, tense suspense: 'My friend' - he insisted, beggingly - 'Are those that you are touching not intestines?'</page><page sequence="13">Concert Parties in Northern Ghana 13 'They are indeed' - I insisted, bloody mindedly - 'and I am very pissed off with you because today I could not have my roast pork liver at Mister Opoku's chop bar because -1 found out - you people had bought all the pig's entrails and blood at once...'. 'I beg you...' he said, dejectedly. 'What you are doing is very bad' -1 reiterated: 'Making these people believe that you can kill a woman and then resurrect her... can anybody ever do that?' My interlocutor came back at me with one of those one liners which, several times throughout my stay in Ghand, have put paid to attempts to argue myself out of a sticky situation 'the obroni way'. 'You are right, my friend' - he said resignedly - 'but can a monkey ever be a Prime Minister?' I was about to reply that there was plenty of evidence for that everywhere, but then the surreal character of the entire situation got the better of me - and I capitulated: I raised my blood smeared arms to the sky and proclaimed that - yes! - the woman had been truly and duly disembowelled. Cheers broke from the crowd, the women ululating, the men all wanting to shake hands and congratulate me. For what I will never know, but there and then I had the distinct impression that there was a feeling of great relief they had not been duped, that 'the event' had actually taken place... As I was still stumbling to regain my corner, with people touching, pressing and singing my praise, the woman was reconnected to her innards, hastily resurrected amidst much cheering and rejoicing - and quickly sent on her way. I did not stay to see what would happen next, nor did I linger about waiting for the morning oracle of the severed head. I was told later that the konsah people had indeed cancelled the oracular bit and left K. in the early morning. Whether they had been persuaded to leave by the awareness that K. had become a much more enlightened place than its fame as a hopeless bush hole had lead them to believe, or whether - more likely - they had got whiff that Father L. was clomping his way back from Accra, I will never be in the position to tell. Back in D., however, I was able to gather more information about the elders' opposition to the konsah. My friend K., the son of the village chief and a respected, successful hunter, told me that what upset his father and his elders most was that the young people in the village were made to believe that, as he put it: 'These bad people from the South can do things that no human being can do. To kill people and then make them live again? How? No human being can do that. It is true that Father L. said that Yesu was killed and then came back again - but then he was God's son and it happened a long time ago anyway. But these konsah people? They are thieves...'. It would be wrong to think that episodes pitching the upholders of the 'traditional' order against the harbingers of 'modernity' and its</page><page sequence="14">14 Cesare Pop-pi internal contradictions - of which more will be said later - are confined to the last strongholds of conservative 'native cultures'. On 21 May 2001, the Ghanaian Chronicle reported that a prominent member of the Ga traditional council had led a group of youngsters on an assault against a number of Christian congregations whose drumming during the liturgy was in breach of a month-long ban on drumming connected to some unspecified Ga 'traditional fetish'. A number of people had been injured, property had been stolen and the sites of the Bibleway Assemblies of God Church and of the Christ Apostolic Church among others had been raided. The conflict - we are told - had been brewing for months before the actual clashes, with both parties issuing warnings and resorting to threats when the former failed. What is perhaps most interesting, is that it appears that the 'traditionalist' Ga were supporters of the leftist opposition People Democratic Congress, whereas the Christians were by and large supporters of the party currently in government. I have witnessed several instances when the conflict between 'traditionalists' (for want of a better word) and converted 'modernists' broke off over the right to stage cultural performances against the opponent's desires. As I have illustrated elsewhere (Poppi 2002), stand offs and fights break out occasionally during funerals involving the performance of the Sigma masks in the Northern parts of Ghana. These are more usually due to the uncompromising determination by Christian converts of the Evangelical and Pentecostal churches to hold prayer sessions right in the middle of the village square at a time when the masks are due to dance. The kind of cultural dynamics that obtain today in Northern Ghana are such that no settlement of the relationship between 'the gods of old' and the new, hegemonic Evangelical churches described by Birgit Meyer for the coastal South has (yet?) been reached. In particular, the Sigma masks have not (yet?) been persuaded - so to speak - that the only way to make a living in the new era is to play 'the bad guys' in the new, modernized plots of the religious drama designed by the emerging churches - or, for that matter, dance outside Roman Catholic churches at Christmas. But this state of affairs goes together with the resistance - both implicit and explicit - to accepting the kind of cultural correlates that go together with the type of modernization (and its internal contradictions) encoded in performative events such as konsah. Given the constraints of the present paper, I can only explore one particular aspect of such 'modernization', an aspect that is at the same time paradigmatic of cultural-cum-cognitive developments as well as detectable cross-culturally. With the development and increasing encroachment of visual media of all kinds into domains hitherto characterised by a low-level of</page><page sequence="15">Concert Parties in Northern Ghana 15 visual material culture, agencies which previously only existed in their oral, often formally undefined or unspecified form, have acquired a solid, concrete materiality, expressed as it may be in paintings, sculpture, photography, cinema or video. While the historical origins of (and responsibility for) the kind of representational imagery that - in West Africa - forms the background for the Sasabonsam of this world remains to be ethnographically and historically explored, one important consequence at the cognitive level is there for all to heed. In the first place, the fact that people can now tell that there are 'pictures of the Devil' going round supports two crucial propositions: in the first place, the Devil 'exists', and it does so in the same encyclopaedic and semantic cognitive framework - to use Sperber's famous distinction - as the sitter of a passport photograph also 'exists'. In other words, what I have termed at the beginning of this paper the 'mediatization' of cultural representations restricts - or at any rate redraws - the boundaries of what Dan Sperber (1974) called 'symbolic knowledge' - whose semi-propositional nature as set 'between inverted commas' is thus somewhat weakened. Secondly, this same process lends support to the proposition that 'somebody has seen the Devil' - and taken his picture, so to speak. These two developments contribute powerfully to the restructuring of the cognitive field on the one hand, and to the emergence of new authority figures on the other: the Devil 'exists', and the Christian Minister is his chief witness. I suggest that this state of affairs is not so much a way to accommodate the gods of old and of giving them a new lease of life in a cultural form set on a continuum with the ways of old. In fact, I would rather argue, it constitutes a crucial change of the 'traditional' cognitive mode of representation. This is because it reifies 'gods' and other similar agencies hitherto set within a cognitive domain of a semi-propositional nature into referential, and therefore potentially fully propositional, iconic representations 3. Most importantly, since the latter's' very 'existence' as icons becomes self-evident, it also provides support for a kind of I stress the potential nature of the process for I do not wish to make assumptions about each actor's own response to the process itself. Namely, I am aware on the one hand that some members of the audience responded to the conjuring tricks of the konsah according to what might be called a 'make believe' cognitive disposition. However, I am also persuaded that others actually 'believed' in the literality of the events they were witnessing. This order of issues raises the problem of the cognitive nature of the 'make believe' in general, which only recently has received scholarly attention (Goody 1997). But it also implies the discussion of what 'make believe' actually means - and implies - in sociocultural formations where there is no tradition of theatrical performances. Neither, of course, can be discussed further here.</page><page sequence="16">16 Cesare Poppi 'elementary nominalism' by which if there is an image of X, then X is also 'out there' somewhere and somehow. This process parallels, mutatis mutandis, the kind of 'cognitive quid-pro-quos' discussed by Jack Goody in his Representations and Contradictions (1997: esp. Ch.6) in relation to the novel. What we might call 'the syndrome of Don Quixote', which prompts the perceiver of representations 'to mistake signs for wonders' - to use Franco Moretti's expression - applies as much - and probably all the more - to visual representations as it does to its counterpart reified in texts. Moreover, and most importantly for its sociological consequences, the process does not stop at the reification of representations at the cognitive level of cultural perceptions. At the same time, in fact, it redirects the process of validation, away from the 'traditional', impersonal, institutionalised and socialised mode of authoritative truth-validation described by Pascal Boyer in his Tradition as Truth and Communication (Boyer 1990), towards the subjective 'witnessing' paradigm promoted by the Christian churches especially in their fundamentalist expressions. It is impossible to delve any deeper here into the theoretical implications of these many dynamics. What must be stressed for the present purpose is that the process described above cannot be taken for granted. In a certain sense, given both the aspects of de-symbolization and reification described above as characteristic of modernization, it can be argued that 'modern' urban dwellers are paradoxically 'more credulous' than their rural, 'traditionalist' colleagues. In my dealings with the leadership of the Sigma secret society of masks - an ideal candidate on paper for both the authorship and the passive, credulous subscription of 'symbolical propositions' - I was often struck by the scepticism that the elders manifested when confronted with certain statements of a semi-propositional kind. On several occasions I noticed a sort of embarrassed reluctance in subscribing to open, clear-cut, explicit and de-contexualized formulations of the society's tenets. What was often only implicit in the fluidity of the society's everyday functioning, was looked upon with uneasy, embarrassed suspicion. If objectified in explicit propositions, for example, if everybody 'believed' in practice that the cries of the laughing dove (Streptotelya Senegalensis) brought news from the spirits of the bush to the competent elders, very few - if any - of my friends seemed prepared to subscribe to that as an explicit proposition or 'confessional' form. More prosaically, some of the elders of the Sigma society outright rejected the claims of wandering ejo diviners to be able to detect witches, while they expressed a sort of bemused scepticism at the claims of both Muslims and Christians that 'they had seen God and spoken to Him'.</page><page sequence="17">Concert Parties in Northern Ghana 17 Though inclined to give Christians the benefit of the doubt - for after all 'it is the White Man who builds motorbikes' - my friend and mentor Baari Naa Saama, the leader of the Sigma society, was particularly sceptical of and bemused by the general claim that the People of the Book(s) entente cordiale with God made them better people than their kaffir counterparts. In a similar vein, I witnessed on several occasions my Vagla friends jeeringly booing out of a possession session dancers who appeared 'to fake it' in order to show off. 3 - Cognition and modernization: where does popular culture stand? As Jack Goody has pointed out in his A kernel of doubt (1996), sceptical and ambivalent attitudes towards semi-propositional representations are not as common in 'traditional', orally transmitted cultures as is often believed. The evidence that I have been discussing suggests that the reification of such forms of representation pursued at all levels by what I have termed modernity's 'mediatization', promotes the reverse of the process, to the point of turning cultural utterances, hitherto held in a semi-propositional guise, into fully propositional, incontrovertible tenets of a representational kind. In the light of what has been argued above, the current understanding of the relationship between 'modernization' and the set of 'beliefs' of old cannot be understood sic et simpliciter as the translation of 'the traditional' in new forms. I have tried to argue that this implies fundamental shifts both in the cognitive processes that shape 'beliefs' as well as in the way such processes are validated. The 'translation' which occurs when the gods of old are reinterpreted within the modernized context of reference of Pentecostalist and Evangelical churches - to use Meyer's analytical framework - reshapes not only the moral attributes and the formal trappings of the old Pantheon. It affects more generally the cognitive structure of the representational domain on the one hand, and the structure of its validation on the other. The 'as seen on TV' syndrome of contemporary urban culture bestows a nominalist quality of self-evidence and self-validation on representatives. Cast in a different cognitive mould in representational regimes unsupported by extensive visual media. The importance of such changes can hardly be overstated, for - mutatis mutandis - we find similar dynamics at work at other times and in other places. As Vincenzo Fazzo has convincingly argued in his classic work La Giustificazione delle Immagini dall'Antichita al Cristianesimo (1977), at the time when the imagery of the gods became objectified in a naturalistic, anthropomorphic way in Greek classical art, the fate of the gods was also sealed. Either they became simply allegories of a literary kind for the learned classes on the way to atheism - as Plato complained</page><page sequence="18">18 Cesare Poppi - or else they turned into 'superstitions' subscribed to by the popular classes and cynically exploited by the ruling elites for political purposes. Finally, to go back to the original concern of this paper, the considerations above have important consequences for the conceptual category of 'popular culture' in understanding West African urban mass culture in general, and Ghanaian in particular. The blanket term 'popular culture' suffers from an excess of coverage. It does not allow for what I called earlier on the internal decalages between both levels and systems of culture. If statistically and perhaps sociologically 'popular culture' of the type described in the new cultural studies can be accepted as dominant if not altogether hegemonic, a more nuanced approach may certify that this happens, in no obvious or uncontested way. There are large sectors of contemporary Ghanaian culture which not only are not - yet? - engulfed by the 'culture as performance' trend of the coastal South. Moreover, there is evidence that such trends are actively opposed and contested by actors in the social process for whom the popular culture of others is not popular at all. These actors still operate within a framework of reference where culture is not performed, represented or 'mediatized' and - whatever their reasons - they seem not to be prepared to give in without a fight. In this respect, it would be of great help to go back to the debate on popular culture which took place in Italy in the 1970s and early 1980s. Scholars such as Piero Camporesi - the author of the celebrated The Land of Hunger (1996), repeatedly contested the line taken by scholars such as Michail Bachtin and, later revived by Carlo Ginzburg, Peter Burke and others, according to which 'popular culture' is - by its very nature - alternative and 'other' vis-a-vis 'high' or dominant culture (Camporesi 1981). Camporesi was very much against such a radical interpretation of Gramsci's tactical - and tactful - understanding of 'the people's culture' antagonistic stance. On the contrary, he argued, 'popular culture' is itself internally diverse and stratified, imbued with all sorts of internecine struggles, opposing and staggered currents and trends. These are global, cross-cultural dynamics, as I have tried to illustrate with respect to the contested developments of contemporary cultural policies of both an explicit and an implicit type amongst the Ladin ethnic minority of the Dolomites. Here too, a 'traditionalist' hard-core is currently fighting against the 'modernists' trend towards making of 'popular culture' a matter of self-conscious performance and celebratory re-presentation (Poppi 1992 and 2002 (a)). Such trends are not exclusive to the more familiar sectors of globalized culture in the West, but are now reaching the villages of the Ghanaian North - where they are met with an original and lively opposition. This paper has documented part of that process as well as suggesting its premises, consequences and theoretical implications.</page><page sequence="19">Concert Parties in Northern Ghana 19 References Barber, Karin. 1991.
