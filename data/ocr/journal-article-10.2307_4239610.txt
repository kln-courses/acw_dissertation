<plain_text><page sequence="1">PAUL SCHEERBART, FANTAST OF "OTHERNESS" 109 Franz Rottensteiner Paul Scheerbart, Fantast of "Otherness" If one classifies literature only according to the objects described in it, Paul Scheerbart' is undoubtedly an SF writer, for much of his work is located in the cosmos. Indeed, the cosmos is perhaps Scheerbart's very own domain (though he also wrote about an Orient that- might have come straight out of The Arabian Nights, and about other sufficiently far and exotic realms of this planet-e.g., Aus- tralia). But what a strange look there is to his cosmos! It has no mathematico- scientific regularity of an ordered Euclidean (or for that matter non-Euclidean) space; there is no accurate and mathematically computed space travel as in Jules Verne-or indeed in Scheerbart's German contemporary Kurd Lasswitz, in whose Aufzwei Planeten (1897; translated as Two Planets) a manual for travelling be- tween the planets may be hidden. Scheerbart's novel Na Prost! (Your Health!, 1898) takes place aboard a grotesque space vessel, an octagonal bottle, containing three scholars of German philology who have survived the destruction of Earth by an iron comet; deep space is also the stage of Die wilde Jagd (The Wild Hunt, 1901), Liwuna und Kaid6h (1902), and Kometentanz (Comet Dance, 1903); the great revolution of the epynomous novel Die grosse Revolution (1902) happens on the Moon; the fate of the great builder Lesabendio in the novel of that name (1913) fulfills itself on the asteroid Pallas; and the background of the Astrale Novelletten (Stellar Short Stories, 1912) are Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and a num- ber of asteroids. The starry domains are also the locale of many of Scheerbart's short plays and quite a few of the short stories with which his oddly titled "novels" are liberally sprinkled, such as Ich liebe Dich! (I Love You! [1898], subtitled "a railway novel") and Immer mutig! (Courage [1902], a "fantastic hippopotami novel").2 Scheerbart's work is unique inasmuch as no human characters appear in these cosmic fancies (except in the frame-stories of the novels). Nobody sets off to conquer outer space, and no alien monsters invade Earth. Scheerbart's cos- mos is inhabited by a multitude of sentient beings, which take a variety of the most bizarre, bright forms and undergo constant metamorphoses; everything is in flux, and anything can become anything else, with no final recognizable goal for those incessant changes. The major, if not the only, justification for Scheerbart's cosmic landscapes appears to be pleasing the imagination of the reader by ever new, sur- prising changes in form and color-a kaleidoscope of world-pictures. Conse- quently, Scheerbart's almost plotless stories are arranged as sight-seeing tours: the reader is confronted with the author's ever-new ideas, and especially most of the longer "novels" are merely a pretext for telling brief tales of an anecdotal character. (One lost novel, Uberirdische Reisen [Unearthly Journeys] was to con- tain no less than 333 of Scheerbart's stories, shot up into the atmosphere for the amusement of newly discovered "meteoric spirits.") Scheerbart affected a deliberately simple, almost child-like style, rich in colors and images and quite free of any bathos: whenever there was danger of that, Scheerbart undercut it by some everyday banality. He was a humorist and an ironist. In his carefree, fairy-tale-like world, human beings are viewed only</page><page sequence="2">110 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 11 (1984) as monsters, as objects of terror but also of ridicule, in a universe unfettered by the laws of gravity-the absolute opposite of what would otherwise be an Eden. Man is as much comic as monstrous; in particular, his manners of eating and pro- creating are endlessly ridiculed by the more refined inhabitants of the cosmos. Nonetheless, human beings and human customs are always implied in the back- ground, and their barbarous and irrational discord occasionally breaks through Scheerbart's antithetic outer space of harmony and bright serenity. Most critics consider Scheerbart to be a playful, indeed even childish, crea- tor of counter-worlds which are a positive counterpart to this vale of tears.3 In real life Scheerbart was an enemy of all kinds of militarism, a totally un-Prussian Prussian who made fun of the pillars of the German state, the military, and the bureaucracy. However, a recent critic has undertaken to strip Scheerbart of this camouflage-and to expose the immanent inhumanity and totalitarian tendencies in his work.4 In Ernst Osterkamp's view, Scheerbart too was infected by the blights of his time, much as he professed to protest against them. Especially the "glass architecture" which he advocated with great zeal and absolute devotion is an aesthetic that would exclude the "other" to which Scheerbart was constantly referring, and with it any chance of utopia. These arguments of Osterkamp's deserve some attention. "The naive belief in the possibilities of technology, which kept optimism alive in Scheerbart's days, " he says, "is shared by him wholeheartedly; indeed, most of his imaginings are based on it."5 That is correct as far as it goes, for in many of Scheerbart's cosmic visions gigantic technological projects are under way, most prominently the Babylonia-size tower-building of the Pallasians in Lesab6ndio. There can be no doubt about Scheerbart's enthusiasm for technology, and in this respect he is certainly a child of his age. His work is so full of new, marvellous, and mostly gigantic machines that some have claimed for him the role of a technological pro- phet.6 But not only do his machines have the function of a magic wand; they are also as a rule highly and beautifully visible, these balloons, world-lanterns, giant electric search-lights, etc. In their highest significance, therefore, they testify not so much to an enthusiasm for technology as to a disregard for technological understanding (something that Scheerbart had in common with most German wri- ters of the time). At the basis of all technology are the ordered flow of events in the cosmos and the general validity of the laws of nature, among which the law of gravity and the principle of the conservation of energy were, in the late 19th century, the most important. Scheerbart had a decidedly personal attitude towards these. His most relevant statement about them is contained in the charmingly eccentric book- let Das Perpetuum mobile (1910). A perpetuum mobile is not only the most perfect of all machines (which constitutes its special attraction) but also one truly impossi- ble, a reduction of science and technology to the absurd. In his "history of an invention, " Scheerbart, using the form of a diary, describes his attempts, as obsti- nate as they were futile, to build a perpetuum mobile that he fondly personalized as "Perpeh. " (He even wrote to friends greeting cards from "Perpeh. ") One can- not avoid the impression that it was especially the lure of the impossible that at- tracted him. "Physicists were always hateful to me," he wrote. "What concern of mine is Robert Mayer-and the law of the conservation of energy? " (Perpetuum Mobile, p. 6). Scheerbart, who was always living in squalor, scraped together the money for constructing "Perpeh" by going hungry.7 But "Perpeh" just wouldn't function. In the end Scheerbart was forced to make a virtue of its failure:</page><page sequence="3">PAUL SCHEERBART, FANTAST OF "OTHERNESS" 111 "... .I really do not fervently desire the practical application of this Perpetuum. Everyday reality will destroy many of my fancies. I am well aware of that" (Perpe- tuum Mobile, p. 41). But beyond that, he claimed he had found the solution to the problem, but kept it to himself; he thought that the Earth itself was a genuine perpetuum mobile because of its diurnal rotation. Scheerbart's cosmic space is, it must be admitted, quite different from that known to physics, and he was deeply persuaded of it. On the one hand, everything in his cosmos is quite simple (this became a cliche with Scheerbart, to be repeated again and again); on the other hand it is very complicated: Matter is, as I already said, quite more complicated than human beings like to believe. Indeed! As if the laws of our solar system would depend upon the schol- ars. They might well imagine that the forces inherent in matter must become much more complicated, and that the matter possessed of such forces will get more complicated. To put it short: any body has its particular attraction-and every human being too-and any star in the same way. The physical laws that our learned inhabitants of the Earth's crust have just concocted are insufficient for our solar system. Everything is simply-more complicated. Don't treat the stars as if they were clumsy clumps of pulp-the stars are great and sentient beings-you must get used to this. ("Professor Kienbeins Abenteuer" [i.e., "Adventures"], in Astrale Novelleten, p. 119) For Scheerbart, technology is not founded in the known laws of mechanics, but rather in arbitrary movements and sympathies; and cosmic objects are not dead bodies from the realm of necessity, but (not unlike in Gustav Theodor Fechner) living organisms with souls, constantly changing of their own free will. The circumstances that pose the greatest problems for the poor inhabitants of the "Earth's crust, " the material conditions of their existence, are vastly simpli- fied or eliminated altogether for the astral beings: that holds true for food, sexual intercourse and procreation, work, and political goals. The inhabitants of Pallas in Lesab6ndio, for instance, nourish themselves by absorbing fungi through the skin, without any further preparation or effort. The Ceresians in "Zack und Sidi und der groBe Kopf" ("Zack and Sidi and the Great Head" -another Astrale Novellette) breakfast during flight, and again their food is absorbed, this time through their blown-up balloon bodies (even that they consider bothersome- although it provides them with new strength and a happy mood-for it keeps them from their favorite occupation, the painting of concave mirrors). The Venusians in "Die neue Oberwelt" ("The New Overworld'" -another of the Astrale Novel- letten) get hungry only once in a while, and then their bodily hairs grow roots into the rubber-like surface of Venus, several thousand meters in a few hours, and through these capillaries they draw their food. Whatever the physical particu- lars of eating, it is in Scheerbart an activity invariably simple, effortless, and easily done. Nevertheless, it also appears as a waste of time, as a relict of a past one has to get rid of, and as a disturbing reminder of bodily functions on the evolution- ary path towards greater spirituality. Sharply contrasted to this are exuberant de- scriptions of feastings and material pleasures on Earth-a direct escape from Scheerbart's dreary existence. The German scholars in Na Prost!, for instance, drink ocean-blue fool's wine and smoke cigars one meter long, and their goose- berry-shaped spaceship-bottle is stocked with choice delicacies. Such exuberances are apparently only the obverse of Earth, that bungled work of art where life still devours life amid death and excrement.</page><page sequence="4">112 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 11 (1984) Scheerbart considered sexuality and procreation similarly bothersome and ridiculous. Despite his enthusiasm for Oriental ways of living and sensual plea- sures, Scheerbart called himself an "anti-eroticist" and never tired of describing the usual method of human procreation as both crude and funny. The non- terrestrial inhabitants of the cosmos usually have advanced beyond this stage, though their coming into existence often is still more ridiculous. The Jovians in the play "Das dumme Luder" ("The Ass" -in Revolutionare Theater- Bibliothek) are begotten when "a man and a woman jointly have spat five hundred times in two hours against two white walls." More aesthetic is the generation of the Venusians in "Die neue Oberwelt": flower-like outgrowths at the backs of the Venusians develop butterfly-like wings which then contract into a ball, form- ing into a fruit that rapidly grows, until it detaches itself from the body and be- comes a new Venusian. The Pallasians of Lesabendio are not born at all; they are found as nuts in the rock, which are then cracked; and as soon as they have been thus "hatched," they begin to tell many amusing stories. In short, the author is always inventing new methods to avoid the unpleasantness of sexual intercourse. Hunger, sex, and working for a livelihood are unheard of in Scheerbart's cosmic world, for they are the chains that fetter human beings to the Earth and the gravity of terrestrial conditions. They are restrictions to be disrupted, just as Scheerbart got rid of the fetters of natural law. Scientists, claims Scheerbart, draw conclusions about the wide cosmos from human circumstances; this he rejects as anthropocentric thinking. In his opinion, Kant had diminished space and time by turning them into categories of human thought-in reality everything is quite dif- ferent from what is imagined by human thinking. Scheerbart's central aim is to create a radical otherness. His fictional uni- verse of cosmic landscapes is not a mimetic representation of some objective real- ity; nor is it an extrapolation of terrestrial theories and laws into the cosmos of the future. It is in no way prophecy or a hypothetical alternative reality proferred as something plausible; it isn't even, as a rule, a space of utopian longings that human beings could realize (though Scheerbart's "glass architecture" is an excep- tion to this rule). Instead, it is a realm of the imagination, a world of freedom and aesthetics, unrestricted by probability or even possibility, a world whose cen- tral law is constant change-and a desire for novelty. Thus technology and science interest Scheerbart only in their playful aspects, insofar as they may further his aesthetic cosmos. Only where the natural-organic metamorphoses are insufficient does he resort to technological means. But even then, it is nature which handily provides those means-e.g., in the form of planet-size lenses for the observation of Earth and the universe in Die grosse Revolution, or in the iron bars conveniently found in the rock just where they are needed for building the tower in Lesabendio. By the same token, Scheerbart is also not a creator of worlds wherein the downtrodden masses find social justice and liberation. Such pictures don't interest him at all, for he is profoundly innocent of politics in that sense. Happiness, for him, lies beyond the liberation from drudgery and exploitation-in the possibility of seeing, in partaking in the pleasure of optical impressions. Scheerbart's literary cosmos is totally dominated by visual impressions. Sounds appear only occasionally, as an accompanying music of the spheres, but more often as trumpets announcing the new. Colors and forms, on the other hand, are prevalent. Richly colored crystals and glittering jewels abound (but unlike other fantasists, Scheerbart has no interest in precious substancesper se; it is their aesthetic properties that matter to him, not the scarcity or preciosity of the mate-</page><page sequence="5">PAUL SCHEERBART, FANTAST OF "OTHERNESS" 113 rial); and the inhabitants of the stars assume the brightest shapes, often equipped by nature herself so as to see the better the far universe. These beings have all kinds of adjustable eyes; they can even make them into telescopes in order to get a better view of the beautiful world. The cosmos is a veritable orgy of colors and transformations that have no deeper purpose than to provide an optimal impression of the variety of the visual world, of its ceaseless metamorphoses. Yet these changes, multitudinous though they are, have no ultimate purpose and therefore convey an idea of Scheerbart's world as curiously static. Indeed, the eternal return of ornaments, each similar to those preceding them, gives an impression quite con- trary to Scheerbart's avowed desire for the truly "other" and "new." Cognition for Scheerbart consists in literally perceiving. Its goal is to see the world better and to unite with a "higher being" which is not an intellectual or ethical power, but an aesthetic cosmic Gestalt. The erection of the tower in Lesabe6ndio seems to involve a conflict between artists and technicians, between two different ways of seeing (and changing) the world; but the builders turn out after all to have the same kind of aesthetic motive as the project's enemies. Their aim in constructing their tower is to move upwards and outwards, beyond the bor- ders of the "funnel-world" Pallas, beyond the glowing "head-cloud" that pre- vents a clear view of the cosmos and its marvels. Lesabendio's only dimly felt purpose is the tower-building not as an end in itself, but as a means of reaching into the cosmos and joining up with a "higher existence, " the living cosmic cloud and the until then hidden "head system" of Pallas. The "new," the "higher," the "other" is thus for Scheerbart never a prin- ciple, a way of thinking, but always a surface form, an aesthetic figure. To aim at the "new" in art, as the Australians in far Melbourne do in his novel Miunchhau- sen und Clarissa (1906), is also his own goal. The Australians are not interested in the old; they want to create the new. (This is arguably the goal of an aesthetics specific to SF. There is another similarity with SF in that the novelty of content is more important than formal perfection-for the Australians in his novel as for Scheerbart himself. That is not to say that he was altogether uninterested in form, but rather that his regard for it was thoroughly playful and opposed to classicist conceptions. Indeed, the utterly simplified and condensed forms that his fictions assume have the effect of ironizing received notions of form-and also of genre: witness the whimsical and generically ad hoc subtitles that he gives to many of his books.) And yet the "new" in Scheerbart, for all its exotic strangeness and indulgence in alien forms, is familiar: it does not go beyond the re-arranging and recombining of old elements and remains without any deeper philosophical justifi- cation or motive force. It is "pure art" divorced from all terrestrial problems and concerns and obstacles. Beyond the glittering surface of things, the luxuriant variety dazzlingly conveyed through a puzzle-game of language, there is for Scheerbart no system expressible in words; there is only mystical silence, and awe and wonder in the face of unfathomable grandeur. The "other," the "new" of his world accordingly is a matter of appearance alone-of pure surface, pure visualization. Time after time this is what his fictions suggest. A particularly clear expression of what he is about appears in his "Moon novel," Die grosse Revolution, at the point where a dying Lunarian explains to a young one: Many of the Moon folk are dissatisfied with life as it is; they want to enlarge the variety of their world-pictures; they want to see more than they have so far. The Great Revolution that will bring us a withdrawal from the scrutiny of Earth</page><page sequence="6">114 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 11 (1984) is inevitable. But in all our revolutionary zeal we must not forget that only the pure, disinterested perception can bring happiness. We must always remember that even the turbulent pictures can affect us only as pictures-as a great picture- play that we are allowed to witness as a far-off audience. (pp. 30-31) The Lunarians, in other words, restrict their disinterested perception to the cos- mos. The conflict in the novel, the "Great Revolution" of its title, is not about whether some different activity should be attempted but only about what should be observed: Should the Lunarians watch only their terrestrial neighbors, as they have up till now; or should they start looking at the bigger universe by building a giant lens of the diameter of the whole Moon? From the very first page of the book this visual orientation of its topics is quite clearly apparent: "The star with which we are living, our good Moon, wants to have a big eye-and, if it were possible-wants to become finally one big eye-only a single eye-all eye" (p. 1). "Developed beings," the winged snake Lakkarundia from Neptune an- nounces in the "snake novellette" in Ich liebe Dich! to which it gives its name, "always long for the other," "for quietude in a tempest and for a tempest when all is quiet" (p. 161). The narrator of "Lakkaridia," too, wills "the other- always, continuously the other-always again the other" (p. 162). To which the serpent replies that movement will produce in any moment a different view, also: "always the other! Other pictures!" The other-for Scheerbart it is identical with "other pictures," other views, new perspectives. Much the same is the world-view of Kaidoh inLiwuna und Kaidoh. "Happi- ness," he declares, "is always in the other." Therefore [he continues] we must become the other. We must aim at the other. If we are searching without knowing what we want, we are always searching for the other-that is, the unknown, the alien-that is what we long for. And we long for the great transformation. Usually we do not understand it ourselves. But it is no simple transformation-we must be led through it-led into the other-by the spirit that accompanies us always. We must forget our own self- step outside of ourselves-and by this we step into ourselves. A very droll story, but also a very serious story-as ghastly serious as the nonsense that appears as truth to us. In the mirror worlds we perceive the truth in nonsense, and the nonsense in truth. Everything is distorted and translated-a realm of grimaces. But that's always the way of the world, when it appears to us from many sides. We must feel it as a whole-feel it-as a whole." (pp. 14-15) Scheerbart's "other" is always relative to and diametrically at odds with the condition of the story. Yet despite the metamorphoses and the circular dance of images-or rather, because of them-the "other" seems static. In his cosmos considered as a whole, though everything changes, nothing really does: the sum total remains the same in the uninterrupted flux of his world. One thing turns into the "other" without any essential differences or deep conflicts. On the moon, for instance, the new Lunarians grow out of the old: "And strictly speaking it isn't death-it is only a re-birth. And it is marvellous to see how the old changes into the new... [the new] is a complete absorption of the old" (Die grosse Revolution, pp. 29-30). Nor is the longing for the new at all satisfied by the metamorphoses which engender it, but do not essentially differentiate it from the old. As Liwu'na reminds her Kaidoh, "You wanted the new and the other at any price. Now you have the new and the other-and again you are not satisfied."</page><page sequence="7">PAUL SCHEERBART, FANTAST OF "OTHERNESS" 115 Soon [she continues] I'll disregard your wishes, for obviously you wanted some- thing of which you have no idea, not even in dreaming. What you say and what you feel are not important for you. Your desires are an enigma even to yourself.... Although Kaidoh admits this, "their conversation wasn't continued": Below them floated new astral forms-shell stars, every possible form of conches with curved beaks. In the depths of the many shells there was a glitter as from pieces of dia- monds, and during the flashes Kaidoh noticed below the rugged borderline of the stars a mad world-worm, not unlike big chimneys. And the trumpet-stars and the funnel-stars joined the shell-stars and the world-conches. (pp. 33-36) Every discussion of principles or feeling thus invariably leads to new images, to the colorful ornamentation that constitutes the universe-to the "lantern of the world of wonders," as Scheerbart calls it repeatedly. There is no depth to his world; any search for underlying laws he dubs a primitive anthropomorphism, the application of human notions to the unfathomable-i.e., the cosmos. Man must be content with what the surface offers. This is arguably at odds with Scheerbart's romantic desire to look behind the surface of things, into their true essence (undoubtedly, he was much influenced by German romanticism, and especially by Clemens von Brentano); and it also does not readily fit in with his longing for a true communion with the "world spirit. " But then again, Scheerbart was first and foremost a writer-and a humorist at that-not a philosopher-for which reason, it would perhaps be futile to search for a wholly consistent philosophy behind his fiction. In any event, he ironizes many viewpoints, and his stance towards the superficial is at least consistent with his explicit longing for "the other, always the other" and with the relativism that such a longing carries with it. Scheerbart in effect demands an end to the cognitive enterprise, on the grounds that all genuine cognition must transcend the horizon of any human, or otherwise finite, consciousness. Nature as the totality of living and sentient beings cannot be comprehended by the poor reasoning power of the inhabitants of the "Earth's crust." Scheerbart's cognitive position is that of a child who wonders with naive, innocent, wide-open eyes (so as not to miss anything) at the world's marvels, and into whose field of vision ever new wonders perpetually enter from beyond the horizon. That finally accounts for why everything in his world is in motion: to deliver new impressions. That is also the reason for the rotation of Earth, as one character in Die grosse Revolution explains it: "so that the beings populating the Earth's crust should receive ever new pictures from the infinite world. Earth itself will receive new world-pictures-so much is happening in the big world" (p. 21). "Everything is just marvellous" is a recurring phrase in Scheerbart. Motions, mirrors, metamorphoses, natural and artificial lenses, glasses, eyes, towers, vantage points-everything in his cosmos is aimed at multiplying and increasing the visual effects. While there can-be no cognition of the world, the ecstatic effort towards it is reward enough. Thus the Ceresians "pronounce with solemnity" that of course any kind of cognition of the world can only be an illusion. But they didn't grow tired of stressing that even an illusionary cognition was after all a kind of cognition of the world-and that one could get closer to the mys-</page><page sequence="8">116 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 11 (1984) teries of the cosmos, even if one were mistaken every time. Therefore they were very fond of those who believed they had recognized [erkannt] something, although they knew that after all everything was different. And this very appar- ently different-in-each-single-case gave them hope for progress-and they con- sidered it to be the principal factor in all ecstasies. (Astrale Novelletten, p. 95) From the glass and light which are the basic elements of much of his aesthe- tics, Scheerbart expected a purifying effect. This he spells out in his Glasarchi- tektur, that eccentric, amusing architectural capriccio that influenced some Ger- man architects. It is also clear from his Munchhausen tales in Das grosse Licht (The Great Light, 1912), from the novel Das graue Tuch und zehn Prozent Weiss (The Grey and Ten Percent White Cloth, 1914), and from countless other essays and stories. As he writes in Das grosse Licht, The non-understood mysteries, especially the Eleusian mysteries in ancient Greece, achieved their impact foremost by means of a great light that filled all space. And for the mystic the feeling of that light's impact was so totally over- powering that he sank to his knees, even when he had at first been skeptical about the magic of the mysteries. This great light is the core of the mysteries. It is this we should catch even today, and let it exercise its effects in our palaces of glass. The great light makes human beings good-natured. By means of this great light great thoughts come to life in man.... The great light shall become the savior of mankind. (p. 144) Brick buildings, on the other hand, generate bleak thoughts. "Enlightenment" is to be taken quite literally in Scheerbart-just as cognition and ethics are reduced to matters of optics. Is this naive? Certainly, and to such a degree that the author may again be suspected of sinister intentions beneath his colorful, infantile world. After all, we know where and to what purpose such a great light was first used: it figures as the search lights at the "Reichsparteitag" of the Nazi Party in Nuremberg.8 How- ever, far from implying some sinister ideological import (as Osterkamp would have it), this is only evidence of Scheerbart's deep innocence in gauging the real consequences of an idea. This becomes most evident from his pamphlet Die Ent- wicklung des Luftmilitarismus und die Auflosung der europaischen Land-Heere, Festungen und Seeflotten (The Development of Air Militarism and the Disband- mentofthe European LandArmies, Fortresses, and Navies, 1909). There Scheer- bart comes his closest to prophetic SF; but there also a total misunderstanding of the political and military consequences accompanies his brilliant, if playful, views on the coming air-wars, with their wireless aerial torpedoes as well as their usual bombs. Scheerbart (somewhat like Alfred Nobel) maintained that war couldn't be abolished by disarming but only by driving it to its ultimate develop- ment, by brutalizing it. Unfortunately, in spite of the Swiftian ferocity he works up in arguing that the horrors of war will cure human beings of their enthusiasm for it, his conviction has proved to be blatantly untrue. Scheerbart's cosmos is a linguistic construct, a childlike game whereby he tries to escape from the real world into purely imaginative space. It is a game, however, in which the forces of the real world become noticeable again and again-often as a result of the author's fits of misanthropy and contempt for humanity. Yet to take an ideological club to Scheerbart's fragile world of glass and light, as Osterkamp does, is too crude. For all its distance from reality, his world holds its greatest interest for artistic, specifically literary, reasons, rather</page><page sequence="9">PAUL SCHEERBART, FANTAST OF "OTHERNESS" 117 than as evidence for the psychological aberrations of its creator. Scheerbart's is an artificial and artful (though imperfect) paradise, a radical fantasy that can exist only in language, a "utopia" more ethereal than all other utopias, without any ambition to serve as guide for building a better society. In the final analysis, he is not a revolutionary but a "pure" artist. His protest remains purely verbal; and when his anger at the follies of humanity has run its course, he is quite content with the world as it is, reconciled to it by its comic aspects. As Kneppara in Die grosse Revolution remarks: The Star Earth is perhaps among the totally abnormal stars, intended only to prove that the great world is able to make do with the greatest follies-ergo the brief lifespan of Earthlings! Thus viewed, the earlier warfare of the Earthlings is quite excusable. It is hard to see why creatures that are so imperfect should take great care of their lives. The whole murderous life on Earth, seen without sympathy from above, really generates comical effects. And for this reason we are justified in counting Earth among the comical stars. (p. 182) A few pages later, Scheerbart makes the same point more succinctly: "Despite its disgusting features, there is so much that is droll about this star that one could almost like it" (p. 184). Scheerbart's eccentric universe is an attempt to transform the whole world in the direction of an absolute aesthetics, with continuous metamorphoses tending towards a colorful but vague "new, '' other, " and "higher, " all quite naturalisti- cally described. He does not programmatically aim at such a transformation as utopian ideal but rather instead pretends that this sea change is already the reality, the true cosmic state beyond the minuscule realm of Earth and human experience. The inhabitants of "Earth's crust" are not actively opposed so much as they are largely ignored. Scheerbart's world doesn't admit of anything besides its aesthetic nature, attributing to aesthetics a role that is outside its scope in the real world. His work thus moves in a cosmic vacuum and for most readers appears uncon- nected to reality. To make things worse, his refusal to pay tribute to such normal aspects of story-telling as linear plot or traditional characterization only aggra- vates the difficulties of developing an affinity for his cosmos. His work, despite its spirituality, appears to be "cold, " devoid of feeling and emotive power. Conse- quently, though always much admired, even venerated by a few,9 he has been ignored by the mass of readers. His books had small editions during his lifetime, and all attempts to revive his works after the Second World War failed. The more's the pity; for in its specific way, his is so stringent an attempt to express the "new" and the "other" that it has no literary parallel. He conceived of a fantastic other- world not as an alternate reality, but as a presentation of the "true" nature of the world, as a work of pure imagination and simple beauty: therein lies his singular contribution to SF and to fantastic literature. NOTES 1. Paul Scheerbart is one of those writers whose biography is as curious and as interesting as their writings, rich in anecdotes'. He was a living myth, an example of the Bohemian writer, always poor and much given to drink. He was born on January 8, 1863, the son of a carpenter in Leipzig; he dropped in on high school classes but never got a degree. From 1855 on, he was an art critic for various newspapers. In 1892, he founded a soon defunct publishing house, "Verlag deutscher Phantasten. " He married (in 1900) the widow of a postal official. She was some years his senior,</page><page sequence="10">118 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 11 (1984) a large woman with both feet on the ground, to whom he wrote charming notices when he arrived home drunk (some of them published in Von Zimmer zu Zimmer: 70 Schmoll- und Liebesbriefe des Dichters an seine Frau [Berlin-Wilmerdorf, 1921]). He died on October 15, 1915, purportedly having lived finally in a barrel. He starved himself to death, some claim in protest against World War One. Scheerbart was a literary outsider, a clown (perhaps of genius), a man full of ideas and, what is more, perhaps also wisdom. At one time, he wanted to found a newspaper just for the millionaires of Berlin (to report their non-existent altruistic benefactions to the arts and sciences); at another, a newspaper against militarism (of which nothing came because the prospective publisher had just bought two military papers). Besides fiction, he also wrote many plays and a fair amount of poetry, includ- ing nonsense poems, forerunners of the poetry of Christian Morgenstern. Scheerbart felt close ties to the 18th century. As he stated in one of his few auto- biographical sketches, published posthumously inDerEinzige, No. 27/28, November 191,9, he admired, and was influenced by, Swift, Rabelais, Heinrich Zschokke, and the Count Zinzendorf especially-whom he referred to as those "four Popish natures" ("Pfaffennaturen"). Among the other influences on him, one would certainly also have to name Cyrano de Bergerac. 2. Nearly all of Scheerbart's books are of a fantastic or even S-F nature. In chronological order (with translations of those titles not rendered into English above), they are: DasParadies: DieHeimatderKunst [Paradise: The Homeland of Art]. Berlin: George und Fiedler, 1889.

Extensive bibliographies on Scheerbart are to be found in the re-issue of Glasar- chitektur (Munich: Rogner &amp; Bernhard, 1971), pp. 195-213, and in the two-volume critical edition compiled by Mechtild Rausch for the "Fruihe Texte der Moderne" series: Regierungsfreundliche Schauspiele: Gesammelte Arbeiten fir das Theater (Munich: Edition Text und Kritik, 1977), pp. 175-96. After the Second World War, selections and omnibus volumes began appearing: Paul Scheerbart: Eine Einfuhrung in sein Werk und eine Auswahl, ed. Carl Mumm (Wiesbaden: Steiner, 1955); Dichterische Hauptwerke, ed. Else Harke (Stuttgart: Goverts, 1962: this contains Tarub, Bagdads beruhmteKochin; Rakk6x derBillionar; Die See-Schlage: Munchhausen und Clarissa; Flora Mohr, and Lesabendio); and Mainchhausens Wiederkehr: Phantastische Geschichten, ed. Anne Gabrisch (Berlin [GDR]: Eulenspiegel Verlag; Ziirich: Limmat, 1966). Scheerbart's dramatic writings were collected in the two volumes Revolutiona're Theater-Bibliothek and Regierungsfreundliche Schauspiele (see above). Some indi- vidual titles have also been re-issued: Lesabendio by Deutscher Taschenbuch-Verlag; Rakk6x derBilliona'r, with Die wildeJagd, and Von Zimmerzu Zimmer by Insel Ver- lag; and Das perpetuum mobile, Machtspa'sse, Von Zimmer zu Zimmer, an enlarged Jenseits-Galerie, and Cervantes by the small press Klaus G. Renner. The latest edition, from the GDR, is the beautiful Die grosse Revolution (Leipzig &amp; Weimar: Gustav Kiepenheuer, 1983), illustrated with Scheerbart's own drawings from Jenseits- Galerie. Many of these editions contain useful forewords or afterwords: the Deutscher Taschenbuch Lesab6ndio, ed. Paul Raabe; Regierungsfreundliche Schauspiele, ed. Mechtild Rausch (comprehensive on Scheerbart's contribution to the stage, but also succinct on his aesthetics; Rausch argues that he was by no means a formless blusterer but always conscious of form; although he preferred vastly simplified literary expres-</page><page sequence="12">120 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 11 (1984) sions, he ironized a wide range of literary genres); Die grosse Revolution, ed. Vera Hauschild (especially good on Scheerbart's pacifism); Munchhausens Wiederkehr, ed. Anne Gabrisch; Glasarchitektur, ed. Wolfgang Pehnt; and Rakk6x derBillionar, which I edited. The big Dichterische Hauptwerke, however, contains only a banal afterword by Else Harke and an equally banal foreword by Scheerbart's literary executor, Hel- mut Draws-Tychsen, who did his best to prevent any Scheerbart revival from taking place. 3. Alfred Liede, "Das kosmische Spiel: Paul Scheerbart," in his Dichtung als Spiel (Berlin, 1963), 1:73-92-perhaps still the best all-round essay on Scheerbart-is a good example of this majority approach. Scheerbart has been the subject of several books, and several unprinted disserta- tions, including one in Prague (Paul Scheerbart by E. Schoss, 1935). The first book- length study was Eugen Mondt's Paul Sheerbart: Ein Schopfungsbericht (Leipzig, 1912). Two more recent books are printed dissertations: Christian Ruosch's Diephan- tastisch-surreale Welt im Werke Paul Scheerbarts (Bern, 1970) and Hubertus von Gemmingen's Paul Scheerbarts astrale Literatur (Bern &amp; Frankfurt/Main, 1976). The latter is mostly a monograph on Lesabe'ndio. Of the essays on Scheerbart, probably the most noteworthy are: O.J. Bier- baum's "Der weise Clown," Die Zeit, II (1897): 9-10, 24-26; Albert Ehrenstein's "Paul Scheerbart," in his Ausgenwa'hlte Aufsa'tze (Heidelberg &amp; Darmstadt, 1961), pp. 85-89); Udo Kultermann's "Paul Scheerbart und die Architektur im 20. Jahrhun- dert," in Handbuch des Bauwesens, Deutscher Baukalender, vereinigt mit Baustof- flexikon, 84 (1963): 46-63; and Karl Riha's "Symbol, Kaleidoskop und veritables Jenseits. Zum Wiedererscheinen der Werke Paul Scheerbarts, " in Sprache im technis- chen Zeitalter, 11 (1964):905-09. Many essays and reviews are reprinted in the special Scheerbart issue (no. 22) of my own magazine, Quarber Merkur, 7 (Dec. 1969). 4. Ernst Osterkamp, "Die Gegenwartigkeit von Paul Scheerbarts Gegenwel- ten," Sprache im technischen Zeitalter, 61 (1977):110-26. 5. Ibid., p. 116. 6. Wolfgang Pehnt, in his afterword to the 1972 re-issue of Glasarchitektur, "Paul Scheerbart, ein Dichter der Architekten," lists (pp. 158-59) among that author's predictions: potato-peeling machines; transparent plastics; psychedelic com- positions, including those making use of light and odor; kinetic art; dish-washers; cos- monautics in all its forms; transportable houses, suspended houses, pneumatic constructions. 7. Publisher Ernst Rowohlt's claim is well-known that Scheerbart lived mostly from "grated pikes on bread." 8. For this point, see Werner Helwig's "Poesie im Weltenraum, " in Frankfur- ter Allgemeine Zeitung, Jan. 19, 1963. 9. Among the German writers who admired Scheerbart were O.J. Bierbaum, Erich Miihsam, Anselm Ruest (who proposed Scheerbart for the Nobel prize-the one for peace, not the one for literature), Salomo Friedlander (who published under the pseudonym "Mynona"), Herwarth Walden, Peter Scher, Walter Benjamin, and Albert Ehrenstein. Others had only ridicule for him, among them, in recent times, Arno Schmidt.</page><page sequence="13">PAUL SCHEERBART, FANTAST OF "OTHERNESS" 121 RESUME Franz Rottensteiner. Paul Scheerbart, inventeur d'alterite.-Paul Scheerbart (1 863-1915) est un cas 6trangeparmi les e'crivains d'imagination: Prussien dot6 d'un sens de 1'humour, il a cre'e' un cosmos en transformation et en alt6ration constantes et colore'es, univers de fiction qui est sans parallele dans 1'histoire. Pr6occupe' de contenus nouveaux-avec de curieux extraterrestres, des 6toiles dot6es de sens, despaysages du lointain univers, avec d 'autres architectures, sp6ciale- ment de verre, et de nouvelles formes d 'art -Scheerbart s 'int6ressait surtout a despro- blemes d'esth6tique. Les formes et les genres litt6raires canoniques subissent entre les mains une condensation, une simplification radicale qui ont pour effet de les ironiser. Les lois ordinaires de la physique ne regissentpas son monstrueusement bizarre univers. Ll ridiculise ces lois pr6tendues qui ne sont a ses yeux que les m6diocres pro- duits des vers de terre que nous sommes, impose's aux etres astraux inaccessibles a la raison humaino, etres dont les sympathies et les m6tamorphoses sans but ne servent d 'autre fin que deproduire des visions toujours autres et neuves des espaces cosmiques infinis. Scheerbart seproclamait amoureux de l 'esprit du mondeo. Cela est sans doute vrai, mais cet amour confe're a cet univers esth6tique un caractere curieusement stati- que et sans Ame. Son cosmos est en fait une pure construction litt6raire. Pacifique, d6pourvu des contraintes du travail, de la survie, des douleurs resultant des conflits et des de'ceptions sexuels, il se pre'sente comme un contre-univers dont le monde r6el et la Terre retenues par les lois de la gravit6 figurent 1 'absolue antithese. (FR, RMP) Abstract.-Paul Scheerbart (1863-1915) is a most singularphenomenon among fan- tasts: a Prussian gifted with a sense of humor, he created a cosmos of the most colorful continuous transformations and alterations-a cosmos that is without parallel in liter- ary history. Despite being evidently preoccupied with new contents-with curious alien beings, including sentient stars, with landscapes in the far universe, with other archi- tectures (especially ofglass), and with new art forms-Scheerbart was most interested in aesthetic problems. Accepted literary forms and genres in his hands undergo a con- densation, an uttermost simplification, which has the effect of ironizing them. Nor do the conventional laws of physics rule his monstrously bizarre cosmos. Indeed, he held such laws in ridicule, claiming that they were nothing more than what the poor imagination of "earthworms" imposed upon higher, astral beings inaccessi- ble to human reason-beings whose sympathies and ultimately aimless metamor- phoses serve no goal other than to produce ever "new" and "other" vistas of the incredibly wide cosmic spaces. Scheerbart proclaimed that he was in love with the "world spirit. " That is no doubt true enough, but his attachment to it gives his aesthetic universe of surface form a curiously soulless and static quality. His cosmos is in fact a purely literary construct. Pacifist and free from the drudgery of work, the necessity for food, and the pains of sexual conflicts and disappointments, it stands as a counter-world, implicitly invoking the real world, Earth bound in the fetters of terrestrial gravity, only as its absolute antithesis.
