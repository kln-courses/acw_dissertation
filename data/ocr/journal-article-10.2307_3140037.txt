<plain_text><page sequence="1">PROFESSOR BRUCE'S LECTURES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO. By EDMUND BUCKLEY, PH.D. The University of Chicago. II. EVOLUTION AND AGNOSTICISM. REMARKABLE as is the position occupied by Professor Bruce in relation to historic Christianity, it is equaled in originality, scholarship, and sympathy by his treatment of the scientific and philosophic postulates of Christianity. Readers of the summary of the former in the October number of the BIBLICAL WORLD will desire a summary of the latter. Professor Bruce's conclusions on evolution and on agnosticism are accordingly here presented, and to them just one remark should be added. That undesigned evidence, the telltale voice, bore witness throughout these lectures that if ever envy, hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness had existed in relation to those who, though they might agree in aspiration and moral purpose with the lecturer, differed intel- lectually from him, such feelings had forever passed away. This sympa- thetic power, as rare as it is invaluable in expositor and critic, was possessed by Professor Bruce in an exceptional degree, and this it was, we judge, that from beginning to end inspired his hearers with the confidence in his judgment they evidently felt. EVOLUTION AND THEISM.- The eighteenth century view of the world as a mechanism with a transcendent God has yielded in the nineteenth, under the influence of Lyall, Darwin, and Spencer, to a view of it as an organism with an immanent God. Some thinkers, however, still deem requisite a special action of God at certain crises. Thus Chapman in his " Pre-organic Evolu- tion " holds that the general equilibrium of the primitive world -all needed action ab extra to initiate motion. But, if true, this view would prove of little use to ordinary minds. Again, the origin of life is considered by many a hopeless enigma without the assumption of quickening from an outside source. Bastian and all since him have denied spontaneous generation. Therefore, some theists argue, when life appeared, as all grant it did at a certain time, it did so from the immediate causality of God. But others cry non sequitur, since the condi- tions may have differed, and with them the results. The presumption is always in favor of natural causes, and since life appeared at a particular time, its preconditions probably existed. Life is not more than the action of matter in peculiar combination. Such arguments of Mr. Fiske have led Pro- fessor Drummond and other theists to abandon their old position that the origin of life formed a crisis in evolution, requiring action ab extra, while they hold that God is in all life from beginning to close. 374</page><page sequence="2">PROFESSOR BRUCE'S LECTURES. 375 Many appeal to the origin of consciousness as inexplicable from the natural conditions then present. Here the scientist assumes an agnostic position, and the theist may, with Le Conte, here as before give evolution full sweep and argue to God as the ground of the whole. This Mr. Spencer can concede, and thus God's action on the world becomes conceivable or at least credible in analogy with the action on our bodies of our own spirits. The contention between evolution and theism has been only as to the mode of God's action, which is relatively unimportant. The evolution of man's body from lower animal life is now generally admitted on the evidence of anatomy and embryology. The human embryo passes through the stages of fish, rep- tile and mammal before maturing as man. The evolution of man's mind is still in dispute. Proofs for it are sought in mental phenomena of the lower animals, of savages, and of children. Thus Romanes speaks of recepts as the animal analogy of human concepts, enabling an animal to distinguish a stone from a loaf, and developing into concepts by the aid of language. But does not language presuppose the very thing--reason--it is here introduced to explain ? Evolution seeks to explain the origin of conscience also. Mr. Spencer defines conduct as acts adapted to ends, and hence applicable to all animals. Animals that bear myriads can have no family affection, which begins in mam- mals, and is perfected in man where prolongation of infancy owing to increase of cerebral surface extends the period of parental care. Perhaps the same hysteron froteron as above occurs here also. Mr. Fiske in his " Man's Destiny in the Light of his Origin," a book I exhort everyone to read, has set aside the polemic of his " Cosmic Philosophy " against theism. It appears here that evolution puts man just where revela- tion and the consensus gentium have, at the head of creation, and indeed proves it. If we thus accept the evolution of man's entire nature, we can show that he has significance in an interpretation of the world, in the knowl- edge of God, and in the understanding of himself. Thus, first, in man all that precedes finds its rational end. Second, this evidence of God's purpose in creation grounds the inference to him as like man, whereas the argument from causality would admit of God being as much like one thing--say matter -as another, namely man. It is true that anthropomorphism has marred this concept, but progress takes place here also, every age needing its own prophets. In the third place, man's position in nature grounds a forecast to his destiny in ultimate perfection. Evolutionists like Mr. Fiske and Professor Le Conte accept even the immortality of man as an act of faith in the reason- ableness of God's work. As to Christ and evolution, we must stick to him at all hazards. But he is a problem we may leave the future to solve. AGNOSTICISM.- This term was meant by its originator, Professor T Huxley, to suggest antithesis to gnosticism, the profession of full knowledge about God. Science is often agnostic because jealous of the introduction of</page><page sequence="3">376 THE BIBLICAL WORLD. God into the realm of causality, and because it believes it deprives the old theistic arguments - cosmological and teleological--of their cogency, and finally because it fails to distinguish between man and brutes in point of worth and significance. As to the theistic arguments referred to, interest in them is waning, though Professor R. Flint and Dr. Martineau have restated them and believe in them. Especially notable are the teleological implications of evo- lution pointed out by Professor Flint. There are, (i) That atoms have the marks of manufactured articles. (2) That the hereditary production of like by like is not a matter of necessity. (3) That atoms have only a limited and definite tendency to vary, and thus exclude chance. (4) That overproduction which alone renders selection possible is not necessary. Professor Schurman works in the same direction when he shows that the survival of the fittest does not explain the arrival of the fittest. Kant, while an agnostic on speculative grounds, was a theist on ethical ones, and his position has the advantage that the more moral a man is the more cogent does its support become. Hamilton and Mansel deny all natural knowledge of God, the latter in the interests of censured articles of the Christian faith, which he thus removed from the sphere of man's natural judgment. Against Kant the theist may urge that science now tends to realism, and against Hamilton that only on the ground of the moral nature in man can the morality of God be asserted, which involves that the morality be of the same kind. Agnosticism denies that the existence of God is a necessary assumption of the verdicts of conscience. This assumption is Dr. Martineau's favorite doc- trine, compared by him to the necessary perception of the world. Newman held an opposite opinion, and the truth lies between them. The agnostic can quote Newman here, and himself traces conscience to social control, which Martineau opposes on the ground that a " must " cannot be changed into an "ought." The theist need not dogmatize here, for on any of these theories he may hold that God speaks through conscience, immediately according to Dr. Martineau, mediately according to Mr. Spencer. Again, agnosticism doubts the moral order of the world, or providence, on the ground of the confusion in human life. According to Schopenhauer, the Absolute, if conscious, could be a devil mocking man in cruel sport, and this view is now appearing in light literature. Two cautions are here necessary. (I) Don't assume that the disease is only temporary. (2) Don't flatter yourself there is only little in the world leading to such a view just because all seems well with you. Much is really wrong in the world, and so long as this remains the difficulty with God will remain too. Now, the agnostic position here is not pessimistic as is that of Schopenhauer and his school. Both Mr. Spencer and Mr. Fiske hold that the present condition is transitory to one in which evil will have vanished, and Mr. Fiske recommends for the present resignation, which the agnostics deem admissible in the case of a force, but not in that of a personal God whose justice to future generations cannot excuse injustice to past ones. To this the theist objects that it refuses to</page><page sequence="4">PROFESSOR BRUCE'S LECTURES. 377 allow God time to work, whereas all growth is slow in proportion to its value, and whereas rapid evolution may involve some inherent impossibility. Indeed, evolution lightens the burden by showing that good is coming with certainty, and thus renders faith less liable now than formerly to fluctuations. Old thinkers overcame the difficulty, and the audacity in thought of the author of Job shows that they must not be supposed under bondage to tradi- tional views. Charges against God should be prevented by the considera- tion that the possibility of sin was involved in that of a moral being, and that limitation of the divine power is involved in the same, for a gratia irresistibilis is unthinkable. The harm of sin was not limited to the sinner lest man should become selfish. Only solidarity affords to love a career. The Old Testament was querulous just here, but the New Testament loyally accepts the law of self-sacrifice. Better to win thus than by stupendous and stupefying miracles. Lastly, agnosticism doubts the knowability of God, as in modern German theology. Kant's doctrine of the thing-in-itself, and Schleiermacher's doc- trine of religion as feeling have led to the view that God is known only as he affects man. Thus Ritschl, who dominates theology in Germany, applying the philosophy of Lotze to theology, confines theology to God's relation to man. Not omnipotence, omniscience and the like, but love should be the attribute of God chosen for investigation. Christ has the religious value of God because God's love is manifested in him, and victory granted through him. Even Christ's metaphysical essence is unknowable, and his divinity must be learned, if at all, in his earthly history, as opposed to theories about his pre-existence. Thus in general theology consists of "value - judgments," and such knowl- edge of God is as real as similar knowledge about the world. Natural theology is so much waste effort. Dr. Hermann, an extremist of this school, holds that only through Christ can man learn either that God is or that he is good. To which the obvious objection is that much genuine piety is recorded in the Old Testament, and in non-Christian scriptures. Comparative religion has well shown this, and St. Paul declared it of old. Of course, Christ has a unique value in this regard, but he that claims more exposes himself to the agnostic objection that universal experience must be trusted rather than the testimony of any one individual. Better make Christ the true interpreter of experience than oppose him to it, for, in faith, what one sees there depends much upon the mood of the seer. When Mr. Forsyth declares that nature has no revelation for man because it has no forgiveness, he overlooks such facts as the knitting of bones after fracture and the general tendency to restoration in all living tissue. The combination of agnosticism with ethico-theism in such writers as Car- lyle and Matthew Arnold should be made use of in combating anti-theism. Mr. Arnold showed in "Literature and Dogma" how the Bible is saturated with the notion of God as righteous, and claimed that hence arose its value. It may be well in our times to preach such truths on the basis of Job and Psalms 37 and 73, rather than developed theology. But while the main</page><page sequence="5">378 THE BIBLICAL WORLD contention of Arnold is increasingly approved, it remains true that he has over- looked the greater truth of God's magnanimity in his choice of Israel and manifestation in Christ. Thus England agrees with Germany in anti-dogmatism, restricting the number of affirmations about God, because we do not know them and need not care. This is healthy compared with a belief in the all-importance of dogma, but may easily go too far, as in Germany in reaction from Hegel who made religion a matter of thought.</page></plain_text>
