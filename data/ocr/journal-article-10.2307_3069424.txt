Academy of Management Journal 2002, Vol. 45, No. 6, 1074-1075. INFORMATION FOR CONTRIBUTORS The Academy of Management Journal (AMJ) pub- lishes empirical articles of interest to members of the Academy of Management. The fields and topics of interest to the Academy membership are re- flected in the divisions and interest groups listed on the inside front cover of the Journal. All articles published in the AMJ must make a strong empirical contribution. Purely conceptual papers should be submitted to the Academy of Management Review. All empirical methods-including (but not limited to) qualitative, quantitative, field, laboratory, and combination methods-are welcome. Submissions that do not offer an empirical con- tribution will not be reviewed. Responses to or commentaries on previously published articles will be considered only if they make independent empirical contributions. These submissions, more- over, will also be peer-reviewed. A manuscript's intended empirical contribution is usually the most difficult element to revise in response to reviewer concerns; therefore, authors are urged to have their research designs peer-reviewed before data are col- lected. All articles published in the Journal must make a strong theoretical contribution as well. Manu- scripts that are primarily applied in focus and that have managers-rather than management research- ers-as their intended audience should be submit- ted to the Academy of Management Executive. Sub- missions should reflect a clear understanding of the position of the contribution in the related organi- zation and management literatures. Methodological articles are welcome, but they must contain an accompanying theoretical contribution. All articles published in the AMI must be clearly relevant to management theory and to management practice. The best submissions are those that iden- tify both a compelling practical management issue and a strong theoretical framework for addressing it. Submissions whose authors stop short of consid- ering the implications of their findings for manage- ment will be less favorably reviewed. All articles published in the Journal must be accessible to the Academy's wide-ranging reader- ship. Authors should make the contributions of specialized research to general management theory and practice evident, avoid jargon, and define spe- cialized terms and analytic techniques. Manuscripts should also be written as simply and concisely as possible without sacrificing meaningfulness or clarity of exposition. Initial submissions should be no more than 40 double- spaced pages in total length; however, exceptions for longer manuscripts are allowed for submis- sions reporting qualitative research or multiple studies. The final manuscript length allowed by the editors tends to be commensurate with the magnitude of the potential contribution; manu- scripts over 40 pages in total length often incur the wrath of our reviewers and are unlikely to be pub- lished. Manuscripts that offer an original theoretical and empirical contribution, but one that is smaller in scope, may be published as research notes. Manu- scripts submitted as research notes should not exceed 25 pages, including references, tables, figures, and appendixes. Manuscripts are considered for publication with the understanding that their contents and contribu- tions-both empirical and theoretical-have not been published and are not under consideration for publication elsewhere. Submission of manuscripts previously published in Academy Proceedings is acceptable; similarly, prior presentation at a con- ference or concurrent consideration for presenta- tion at a conference does not disqualify a manu- script from submission to AMJ. Replications of previously published work and very incremental research rarely offer enough of a contribution to warrant publication. Authors should strive to be original, insightful, and theoretically bold; demon- stration of a significant "value-added" advance to the field's understanding of an issue or topic is crucial to acceptance for publication. Papers that draw on multiple studies, methods, and/or data sources are viewed as more likely to make such contributions. A list of the works awarded AMJ's Best Article Award between 1986 and 2000 appears in the October 2001 issue (p. 935). Publication decisions are made by a manu- script's action editor. However, these decisions are based on the recommendations of members of the Journal's Editorial Board or on those of other quali- fied reviewers. Submissions are typically assigned to the editor or to an associate editor and to three reviewers for consideration; particularly weak or inappropriate submissions may be returned without formal re- view. All submissions are subject to blind review; manuscripts prepared in a way that compromises blind review may be returned for revision prior to 1074</page><page sequence="5">2002 being reviewed. The guidelines provided to review- ers are available on the AMJWeb page. Submission of a manuscript to the Journal also carries an im- plicit quid pro quo willingness to review for the Journal. The cornerstone of the editorial process at AMJ is the willingness of colleagues to provide each other feedback through the peer review pro- cess. Authors who submit manuscripts to AMJ for review are expected to reciprocate by serving as reviewers for AMJ if called upon to do so. The Journal strives to provide constructive and developmental feedback to authors within approx- imately two months. The efficiency and effective- ness of the review process can both be dramatically influenced by the initial quality of a submission. The better-developed a manuscript and the ideas it contains, the easier it will be to review, and the better the feedback its author will receive. There- fore, manuscripts should always be peer-reviewed prior to submission to the Journal. Prepare manuscripts in accordance with the Jour- nal's "Style Guide for Authors," which appears in the August 2002 issue and on the AMJ Web page. Manuscripts that are inappropriately prepared tend to be less favorably reviewed. A manuscript that is submitted to AMJ for pub- lication consideration should not appear on any Web site during the review process. A paper posted prior to AMJ submission may be considered for submission but it should be removed from the Web site during the review process itself. The Academy of Management agrees that a working paper posted on the Web will not be considered as previously published and may therefore be considered for sub- sequent publication in an Academy journal. Please submit manuscripts electronically to the editor, Tom Lee, according to the "Instructions for Electronic Submission," also available on the Journal's Web page (http://aom.pace.edu/amj/ electronic.html). Queries about manuscript submis- sion can be made to amjtlee@u.washington.edu. Authors without Internet access may mail a disk: Tom Lee, Editor, Academy of Management Journal, University of Washington Business School, Box 353200, Seattle, WA 98105-3200. Please include a cover letter and your manuscript, prepared accord- ing to the "Style Guide," in a Word-compatible format. The AMJ Team: Thomas W.

STYLE GUIDE FOR AUTHORS This "Style Guide for Authors" covers the for- mat and language to use when preparing manu- scripts for the Academy of Management Journal (AMJ). A different document, "Information for Contributors" (front of each issue or http://aom. pace.edu/amj/submission.html) describes desir- able content. Manuscript Submission and Length Submit manuscripts electronically to the editor at amjtlee@u.washington.edu. Follow the "Instructions for Electronic Submission" (http://aom.pace.edu/ amj/electronic.html). Full articles should not ordinarily exceed 40 manuscript pages, including references, appen- dixes, tables, and figures. Research notes should not ordinarily exceed 25 pages. Manuscript Format AMI is not printed directly from your file. Ac- cepted manuscripts are copy-edited and retyped. You can help this process go smoothly by following these steps: Type and spacing. Use at least 12-point type. Double-space references, endnotes, appendixes, ta- bles, and figures. Double-space everything except quotes more than seven lines long. Indent these as a block. Use wide margins of an inch or more. Don't vary type size-stick with 12-point. Never underline- use italic (for occasional emphasis; names of books and periodicals; certain statistics; and as illustrated under "Citations" and "References," below). Saving. When you save your file, use the option "Embed true-type fonts" (pull down "tools," go to "general options"). Put in hard page breaks be- tween parts of the manuscript, as described in "Back Pages," below. Front Pages Your title page is page 1. Please number it. Address. Under the title of your work, list au- thors' names, affiliations, and complete addresses and contact numbers. Example: AN EXCETLLENT STUDY A. MANAGEMENT SCHOLAR Famous University Special Department Building and/or Street City, State, Zip Code Tel: (000) 000-0000 Fax: (000) 000-0000 e-mail: scholar@fam.edu The details of your address will not appear in AMJ, but we need them to keep in touch with you. Keep the editor's office informed about job changes and long absences. Acknowledgment. If you wish to acknowledge financial support or other assistance, add a note (double-spaced) at the bottom of page 1. Abstract. Your abstract and the title of the work go on page 2. Your abstract should be about 75 words long. Back Pages Group any endnotes, references, appendixes, ta- bles, and figures at the end of your manuscript. Continue your page numbering. Put hard page breaks between these parts. For instance, the refer- ences should begin on a new page, and every table should begin on a new page. Headings and Sections AMI uses only three levels of headings. Main headings designate your major sections; three or four main headings should be enough in most cases. Center your main headings and type them in all capitals. Example: METHODS Second-level headings follow. Type these flush with the left margin, beginning only major words with capitals. Examples: Data and Sample Indent third-level headings. Begin the first word with a capital, end the heading with a period, and continue with your text. Example: Manager sample. Respondents consisted of a random sample of 300 managers... First sample: Bank managers. Respondents consist- ed... 1209</page><page sequence="10">Academy of Management Journal The headings indicate a hierarchy of sections. Sections with main headings precede those with second-level headings, which precede those with third-level headings. Do not skip a step and launch directly into a section with a second-level heading. When you divide a section, use two or more subsections. For instance, a main section needs at least two second-level sections (or none). Second- level sections should be at least a page long. Hypotheses Begin each hypothesis on its own indented line. Fully and separately state each hypothesis you tested separately. Give it a distinct number or num- ber-letter label. Example: Hypothesis la. Concise writing has a positive relation- ship to publication. Hypothesis lb. Following AMJ's "Style Guide for Au- thors" has a positive relationship to publication. Special Words Technical terms. Help your work to be accessible to AMJ's wide-ranging readership. Define key tech- nical terms, both conceptual and analytical ones. A technical term is a word that is not in a general-use dictionary with the meaning you (or even you and other published scholars) ascribe to it. Quotes can replace defining for technical terms that are not key to your work. Abbreviations. Avoid using abbreviations for the names of concepts. Use ordinary words for variable names-not code names or other abbreviations. Use the same name for a variable throughout your text, tables, figures, and appendixes. Endnotes Do not use footnotes-use endnotes. Please use these sparingly, and keep them short. Double-space endnotes in 12-point type so that they will be easy to copy edit and typeset. The printer will shrink them. Math Do not "talk in math" in regular text. Use words. For instance, "We surveyed 100 employees," not "We surveyed n = 100 employees" and "We used chi-squares to evaluate coefficients," not "We used X2s." You can report statistical results using symbols in parentheses. And, unlike the rest of your manu- script, results in parens and equations should be formatted as thoroughly as possible. Use italic as customary-for p, r, b, F, z, and so forth. Use bold italic for vectors; use Greek letters and other needed symbols. Display and number only equations you mention again in your work. Sexist and Biased Language Avoid language that might be interpreted as den- igrating to ethnic or other groups. Be particularly careful in dealing with gender, where long-estab- lished customs, such as the use of "he" as a generic pronoun ("a manager... he"), can imply gender- based discrimination. Using plural pronouns- changing "the manager... he" to "managers... they"-usually helps. Active Voice and First Person Put sentences in the active voice ("I did it"; "They did it") instead of the passive voice ("It was done") to make it easy for readers to see who did what. Use the first person ("I" or "we") to describe what you yourself did: Two items were found to lack factor validity by Earley (1989). [Passive] Earley (1989) found that two items lacked factor validity. [Active] The author developed three new items. [third person] I developed three new items. [first person] Anthropomorphism Avoid describing inanimate entities (models, theories, firms, and so forth) as acting in ways only humans can act. Tables and Figures Useful tables and figures do not duplicate the text; they supplement and clarify it. Because tables and figures are more expensive to prepare for pub- lication than text, please carefully consider what each adds to your work. For each table or figure, center "TABLE" or "FIG- URE" with a number (1, 2, etc.) at the top of the page. Put the title under this, also centered at the top. Number tables and figures consecutively (one se- ries for tables, one for figures). Group your tables and figures at the end of the manuscript as de- scribed under "Back Pages" above. Indicate the po- sition of each in the text as follows: 1210 December</page><page sequence="11">Volume 45, Number 2 Insert Table 2 about here Each table or figure must have a sentence in your text that introduces it. Tables Look at tables in published AMJs that report the type of analysis you are reporting. Imitate them. But use more than one page if you need to. Do not squeeze material onto one page. Our basic table principle is that each table should report one type of analysis (which is identified in the title) and each vertical column and horizontal row should contain only one type of data. Label what you are presenting across the top or down the side-not in the body. For variable names, use ordinary words, not abbreviations, and avoid parentheses. Report only two decimal places for statistics. In correlation matrixes, the correlations should fill the lower-left corner of the table. For general footnotes to tables, use superscript small letters. Significance levels can be summarized in a let- tered footnote ("aAll values greater than . . ."). Or use this format, with every level on a separate line: t p&lt; .10 *p &lt; .05 ** p&lt; .01 *** p&lt; .001 Figures Figures (unlike tables) have graphics. Our printer scans in figures directly from your manuscript. So make sure your figures will print out crisp and clear. Avoid "stacking"-write all words horizontally, not vertically. Use the same variable names you use in the text. Do not abbreviate. Look at figures in published AMJs for format ideas. Citations Citations are your in-text identifications of other research. Minimize self-citations that would reveal your manuscript's authorship. Doing this is impor- tant for protecting the double-blind review process. To cite, enclose authors' names and the year of a work in parentheses. Example: Several studies (Adams, 1974; Brown &amp; Hales, 1975, 1980; Collins, 1976a, 1976b) support this conclusion. Order citations alphabetically. Two or more works by one author (or by an identical group of authors) published in the same year should have "a," "b," etc., added after the year. If a work has no human author(s), cite the peri- odical it is in as the author: (Wall Street Journal, 1990) or cite the "corporate author" that produced it: ".. forecasts of increasing service jobs in the U.S. Industrial Outlook (U.S. Department of Com- merce, 1992)... To cite a direct quotation, give pages after the year, separated from it by a colon. Example: Adams has said that writing a book is "a long and arduous task" (1974: 3). Also cite page numbers when you paraphrase or summarize others' specific arguments or findings. If a work has two authors, give both names every time you cite it. For three through six authors, give all names the first time, then use "et al." Examples: Few field studies use random assignment (Foster, Whittington, Tucker, Horner, Hubbard, &amp; Grimm, 2000). (first citation) ... even when random assignment is not possible (Foster et al., 2000). (subsequent citation) For seven or more authors, use "et al." even for the first citation. (But the matching reference should give all the authors.) References References are your entries in the alphabetical list at the end of your article or research note. This list includes only work you have cited. Alphabetize references by the last name of a sole author, a first author, or an editor, or by the name of a corporate author (for instance, U.S. Census Bureau) or periodical (such as the Wall Street Journal) if there is no human author or editor. Order works by an identical author by year of publication, listing the earliest first. If the years of publication are also the same, differen- tiate entries by adding small letters ("a," "b," etc.) after the years. Repeat author's name for each entry. Book entries follow this form: Authors' or Ed- itors' Last Names, Initials. Year. Title of book.
