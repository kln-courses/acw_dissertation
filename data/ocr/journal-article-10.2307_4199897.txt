<plain_text><page sequence="1">86 CEMETERY A AT KISH: GRAVE GROUPS AND CHRONOLOGY By P. R. S. MOOREY RNEST Mackay's excavations on behalf of the Oxford(Weld)-Field Museum Expedition to Mesopotamia on mound A at Kish (1923-25) were published with exemplary speed and in considerable detail, though the author made clear in his account the very real difficulties involved in establishing the integrity of the grave-groups he was reporting. Unfortunately the publication of the cemetery, in two successive parts, is not consistent. Mackay chose to assemble his finds, both pottery and minor objects, on plates in a typological series; but even these are selective not comprehensive. In the case of graves I-38, which appeared in the first half of the cemetery report, he included a chart from which it is possible, using it in conjunction with the plates on which the location of each object is marked, to reconstruct the grave-groups, though without the field numbers which were never published. In the second half of the cemetery report, which covered graves 39-154, Mackay adopted a system of illustration on plates similar to that used in the first report but with the addition of field numbers for each object. But this time he did not include a chart tabulating the grave-groups. Once again it is possible to reconstruct certain grave-groups from the plates, with assiduous attention to the detailed notes on various types of object given in the main text, though rarely with complete accuracy as by far the greater number of grave-groups were incompletely illustrated. As Mackay's carefully annotated field-cards have survived it is possible to reconstruct all the recorded grave-groups in full, though descriptions of individual objects are at I am most grateful to the Director General of Antiquities in Iraq for permission to study the objects from Kish now in the National Museum of Antiquities in Baghdad and for allowing me to reproduce photo- graphs of IM 5765, and to the Keeper and Visitors of the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, for permission to publish the records held by the museum.

MOOREY times very cryptic.L Even a cursory glance through the catalogue of graves reveals the disturbed condition of a great many of them. As the report inti- mates, and the field-cards confirm, there were many more graves whose contents had been scattered by human or natural activity. A great many objects, exactly comparable to those reported from grave-groups, were recorded without context from the upper levels of mound A. The main purpose of this paper is to provide as concisely as possible a complete guide to the I54 grave-groups reported from mound A (Appendix I) and contemporary graves on Tell Ingharra found later (Appendix II); then to estimate the exact chronological range of the cemetery in the light of subsequent excavations in Iraq. Apart from the fact that this will make available a certain amount of unpublished evidence, such an investigation seemed opportune for a number of more general reasons. When Delougaz published the pottery from excavations in the Diyala region he suggested that cemetery A at Kish was important primarily because it covered a relatively short period of time very late in the Early Dynastic period ill-represented in the sequence of graves at Khafajah and by no means well-represented in building levels on this and other sites excavated by the American Diyala Expedition.2 Most scholars have accepted a dating in Early Dynastic IIIB through Proto-Imperial times for this cemetery.3 Recently, however, in a closely reasoned article Hrouda and Karstens4 have challenged this view and argue that the cemetery was in use continuously from much earlier in Early Dynastic III, thereby giving the cemetery a life of about three hundred years on present reckoning. Their reappraisal of the published evidence is based on a seriation analysis of pottery and small finds, treated separately, in certain selected graves. If this method is viable, and their conclusions tenable, then it has very important implications for the typological chronology of artefacts, notably pottery, from central Iraq in the last main phase of the Early Dynastic period. An examination of this hypothesis will be a prime concern of the following paper. In the last few years a number of reports have appeared which not only augment, but often elucidate more fully, the exact position of cemetery A in the central Mesopotamian sequence. A detailed analysis of the Early Dynastic and Akkadian graves in the area of the 'Royal Cemetery' at Ur has presented fresh conclusions about the most important contemporary cemetery in southern Iraq, whilst the complementary sequence of graves for central Iraq, that from Khafajah, has now been published.5 Equally relevant, though relatively short of ceramic evidence, are Parrot's reports on the Early Dynastic religious build- 1 I have used throughout the field catalogue held by the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. For the years 1923-1925 there is a complete set of object cards, but the grave records and plas have not been traced either in Baghdad, Oxford or Chicago, though there is definite evidence that such existed when Mackay presented his reports for publication.

In view of the conditions in which the work in area A at Kish was done and the manner of publishing it, it must seriously be doubted whether an analysis of the type undertaken by Hrouda and Karstens is really viable, even if the entire published record and not just an arbitrary selection of it had been used. Of the graves properly reported from mound A 46% were disturbed, some very badly, and their contents depleted.8 Initial doubts are accentuated when only a fraction of the graves and a small proportion of their contents were sampled. Only 23% of the graves were used by Hrouda and Karstens in their tabular analysis of pottery-the primary evidence-and at least a quarter of these were reported as disturbed. The problem is aggravated by the absence of any plan of the cemetery, perhaps the most serious lacuna in the surviving records, without which there is no independent check on the horizontal stratigraphy suggested by Hrouda and Karstens.9 Conscious as the authors are of the methodological problems involved in the interpretation of the results derived from their numerical analysis,10 they do not allow for them in the final summary. The graves are divided into four groups taken to represent four successive chronological phases, though this is by no means self-evident. It is assumed, without examination of the evidence, that Palace A was built, destroyed and abandoned entirely within the course of Early Dynastic II. This is then taken as the terminus post quem for the absolute date of the cemetery.1' The glyptic evidence from the graves is particularly important for their demonstration of the four stages.12 Apart from the difficulty of dating the glyptic of Early Dynastic III closely, such evidence never provides more than a terminus post quem 6 Le Temple d'Ishtar, Paris, 1956; Les Temples d'Isrharai ct de Ninni-.aZ.a, I967. 7 In R.

XXII: 'Skeleton plan of palace showing later buildings and positions of graves 'indicates that such a plan originally existed, as one would expect from Mackay's method of work, but all that appears on this plate is the eastern end of palace A. In a letter to Langdon dated I February 1930 Mackay listed all the editorial errors in this volume and suggested placing the missing plan, with grave levels, in AM 1(3); but it never appeared there. 10 ZA 24 (I966), 262. "I Although the authors use the American (Frank- fort) system of terminology they try to relate it to the German system (Moortgat). The attempt is compli- cated by a growing variety in the terminology, all initially based on stylistic analysis, current in Gernan archaeological literature for this period: see for example E. Strommenger, Bagh. Miii. i (1960), I6 ff., Table 2-3; W. Nagel, Moorigat Fesiscbrif, I964, Chart III; R. Boehmer, ZA 27 (I969), 26I if. The con- fusion is particularly acute in Strommenger's attempt to subdivide Early Dynastic II retaining the epithet Mesilim Zeit, and inevitably many of the intimately associated stylistic arguments, for the earlier phase, when there is accumulating evidence that this ruler, and the style of the decorated macehead inscribed for him, may, independently, be attributed to Early Dynastic IIIA: M.

For instance the seal with geometric decoration in grave 87-attributed by Hrouda and Karstens to the earliest phase of the cemetery-is not as they assume Early Dynastic I in date. It belongs with similar seals from the royal cemetery at Ur and the Ishtar Temple at Mari,3 dating to Early Dynastic IIIB. A: The Archaeology of Cemetery A: i-Levels below the Cemetery: The graves on mound A at Kish differ in one important respect from those of an earlier period excavated in the Y sounding on neighbouring Tell Ingharra and in mound A at Khafajah, where graves had been dug below or in relation to the floors of a series of superimposed houses which provided a valuable guide to the sequence of interment. In both cases this extended from late in the Prehistoric period. The situation in the cemetery area at Ur was somewhat different, since the graves were not directly related to houses. But even there various groups of graves can be related to a stratigraphical sequence, though by no means as certainly as at Khafajah. On mound A at Kish widely dispersed graves were found immediately below the surface cut to varying depths, over- lying a large building of plano-convex brick identified as a palace, which had been destroyed and considerably eroded before the graves were dug. With the exception of four burials,14 attributed to the first millennium B.C., all one hundred and fifty graves recorded on the site contained grave-goods of com- parable type. The cemetery was clearly greater in extent than Mackay's work revealed. To the north, when excavating on Tell Ingharra some years later \Vatelin discovered a number of graves more richly equipped than those in mound A, but with identical types of pottery and certainly contemporary.15 These ill-recorded graves must be included in any appraisal of cemetery A. In attempting to establish the chronological span of cemetery A attention must first be paid to the history of the underlying palace and the various frag- mentary buildings found above it.l6 The palace may conveniently be con- sidered first. In the present discussion its final occupation, not its foundation, is the crucial point; but all the available evidence, meagre as it is, may best be considered together. The actual archaeological sequence may be concisely stated. The northern block was built first (rooms 1-3I ) with an entrance to the east by a flight of steps which may represent a secondary stage (rooms 3z-8). The southern block was subsequently added (rooms 39-60) and a ramp laid over the original eastern stairway. Traces of minor repairs and restorations were found in both blocks. A very fine inscribed shell cylinder seal in the ' Fara Style' was found 13 Nissen, 6i; A. Parrot, Le Temple d'Ishtar, 197, pl.

Mackay believed it belonged to a grave, not to the palace period, but this is an open question.'7 At the north-west corner of the palace a spouted vessel was found below the level of the palace foundations (Fig. i, no. 2869). It is closely paralleled in the Diyala region by vessels from levels of Early Dynastic I.18 Closely associated with this was a group of five vessels, three of them spouted (Fig. i, no. 2895 A-E);19 there seems no reason to doubt the excavator's view that, on account of their great depth, these are all earlier than the palace and have no relation to the graves.

MOOREY which normally have a ring-base, wider and much more sharply carinated shoulders.23 Virtually no pottery was associated with the palace occupation and what was is not very distinctive. Cups with convex or pointed bases predominate;24 commonest in Early Dynastic III in the Diyala, they were not found in graves of cemetery A (Fig. 2). One find in the palace is vital for dating its destruction. Grave 23, a richly equipped female burial, was cut down on to a platform of plano-convex brick in chamber 3 I of the palace. In itself this would be of little significance, were it not that in dismantling this platform the excavators found in it a tablet of 'Fara ' type, normally attributed to Early Dynastic IIIA. This one may indeed be slightly later than those from Fara25. Some light is thrown on the relation PALACE 121 1403 (Afber Mackay) Fig. z. Early Dynastic III pottery from Palace A, Kish. of the platform to the structure of room 3 1, in the earlier northern block of the palace, by considering its other internal fittings and those of room 30, across an intervening passage. In both cases the rooms were clearly equipped as work- shops. Room 30 contained three, large bitumen-coated vats almost certainly contemporary with the structure since the pavement was specifically designed to accommodate them.26 In room 31 the pavement was more damaged. Four large limestone blocks set on the floor were probably to support a fitting 23 AM I, pl. LI: Type ' C'. Other objects from low levels at the N.W. corner of the palace were either not kept (2870-71, 2876-pottery) or are not suitable for close dating: stone bowls 2872, 2917. It now seems that Langdon's reference to a deep sounding at the palace in the I928- season is a misunderstanding of Watelin's reports on his work on Ingharra-JRAS (1930), 630. There is no evidence for such work elsewhere in the records and no tracc on the actual site of palace A of a deep sounding. 24 AM I, pi. XXXVII, 4-6; cf. DelougaZ, 99-I00. 25 AM I, ii, 9I, pl.

The bitumen-coated platform, which included the tablet, almost certainly served some function in which water or another liquid played an important part. Even if it is not part of the original structure, it certainly formed part of the palace furnishings during, not after, its destruction. Two aspects of the excavations on Tell Ingharra, subsequent to the work on mound A, also indicate that the palace as excavated is unlikely, from its strati- graphical position, to have been built before Early Dynastic IIIA. As I have argued elsewhere it almost certainly lies above the ' Flood Stratum ', which is to be dated late rather than early in Early Dynastic 11.27 All the fragments of shell inlays excavated on Ingharra, many exactly like those found in the rooms of palace A and the ' Plano-Convex Building ' in area ' P ', were found above the 'Flood Stratum' never below it.28 Mackay and some subsequent commentators assumed that the erosion of palace A to the level found by the excavators must have been a very long process.29 Although there is no scientific evidence available yet on erosion rates, any visitor to a mudbrick site in Iraq excavated in the last fifty years will be aware of the rapidity with which exposed mudbrick walls are worn down, even when deep in excavation trenches. Palace A was a building of unbaked clay bricks and timber, seriously damaged before it was abandoned. Apart from depredations for building material to use elsewhere, the ruined walls, no Jonger roofed or regularly plastered, would have been an easy prey for natural erosion. Amiran in discussing the recent pattern of settlement in Palestine drew attention to the extremely rapid disintegration of abandoned stone-built villages. Sig- nificantly he concluded: ' the disintegration of villages and the formation of a tell is by no means a slow and gradual process taking generations to become effective. Quite the contrary: it is a quick process taking no more than a few years '30 The stratigraphic evidence on mound A suggests then that the palace was abandoned at the earliest during Early Dynastic IIIA. It is by no means clear what happened next. The excavator reported that none of the graves was found directly beneath the walls of the eroded secondary buildings, largely built of bricks plundered from the palace, which he found above the palace buildings, though the pottery reported from the earliest of them is essentially the same as that from the graves.3' For instance Type G, which was par- ticularly characteristic of the finds from these buildings also occurred in one grave.32 In the Diyala this very distinctive form of vessel does not appear before the later Early Dynastic period, as also at Mari, and remains in use until " P.

The various baked clay chariot and wagon models must be related by their contexts to the scattered settlement on the mound during and possibly after the use of the cemetery.40 Models of this kind appear either to be toys or votives, not funerary gifts. Parallels from such sites as Fara, Nuzi, Gawra, Chagar Bazar and Nippur indicate that the type of vehicle model most commonly found on mound A- two-wheeled with a tubular axle at the front and saddle-shaped ridge between the seat and the front-ranges through the later Early Dynastic period to Ur II.41 Apart from the house walls the excavator found two groups of kilns, probably for baking pottery, which are either contemporary with cemetery A or slightly earlier. Is it perhaps possible that pottery was made and sold on the spot for use in furnishing the graves ? One group lay outside the western wall of the palace's southern block, with graves 69 and 70 cut right into them. Two others were found in room 3I of the northern block, one partially built into the eastern wall of the room.42 A number of graves, walls, drains and what may have been well-shafts were found scattered over the mound clearly indicat- ing that it had been intermittently occupied right down to the Abbasid period.43 The stratigraphy of mound A may now be briefly summarized before pro- ceeding to an examination of the cemetery. Palace A, set on some kind of platform, was first built very late in Early Dynastic II or early in Early Dynastic IIIA. Interior fittings of rooms at the eastern end of the northern block were reconstructed, if not actually built, at an advanced date in Early Dynastic IIIA. The palace was destroyed, abandoned and eroded before a rather primitive settlement was established over its ruins. Then or very soon after- wards a large cemetery was dug all over the site extending northwards onto 33 DelougaZ: Typcs C.201.200, 203, 20S; 20I.201a, b; 2I 1.200; C.oi i.zoia, b; A.

There is general agreement among archaeologists and historians that Early Dynastic III lasted between two hundred and fifty and three hundred years.44 If a century or more, extending from the Early Dynastic 11/Early Dynastic IIIA transition, is allowed for the life of the palace, an interval of another century-probably excessive-for its destruction, erosion and resettle- ment, and the best part of a third century for the cemetery all the requirements of the available evidence are perfectly satisfied without undue acceleration of the various natural processes involved. ii-Grave-groups and chronology: In only two cases were later graves reported as cut down into earlier ones: grave 52 was cut into 53, 56 into 58.

It may also be noted that grave 104 contained one of the very rare shaft-hole axe-heads from mound A and an elaborate dagger.48 Grave 5 2 also contained a straight pin with a hole pierced in the shank to take a ring fitting or thread. At Ur Nissen has dated this type of pin specifically to the Akkadian period.49 It also occurs in other Kish graves, notably Ioz and I04. Grave 5 3, cut into by $2, had been so disturbed that only a ' mother-goddess jar ' and an ' offering-stand ' were reported from it, but in both cases not even they are early forms in the system worked out for the Diyala50 (Fig. 4). This is the best stratigraphical evidence available for showing both that cemetery A was not in use for a very great length of time and that the period of use ended in the Akkadian period. A brief review of the whole cemetery and the contemporary burials on Tell Ingharra serves to strengthen this dating. In the following discussion information provided by Mackay is not repeated, though in abbreviated form it will be found in the catalogue of grave-groups in Appendix I. As Hrouda and Karstens have used the cylinder seals from this cemetery as the basis for their phase-dating, discussion may best begin with them.5' Cylinder seals found in the graves may be dated virtually without exception to Early Dynastic III; closer dating within that period is still debatable.52 From cemetery A there are no seals in the Akkadian glyptic style, but in grave 306 on Tell Ingharra WVatelin found a very fine lapis lazuli seal which may be dated to Sargon's reign,53 associated with pottery, stone vessels and personal ornaments typical of cemetery A.54 There is only one seal clearly in the ' Fara Style ' from a grave.55 Had the cemetery been used in the earlier part of Early Dynastic III more such seals would certainly be expected from the graves as they are richly represented among the seal impressions found on Tell Ingharra below the ' Flood Stratum '.56 The subjects found on the cylinder seals from cemetery A are remarkably consistent, only occasionally departing from standard themes of animals in file, animals or men and animals in combat. 45 P.

The theme of the anthro- pomorphic boat is another motif most comprehensively documented in central Iraq and used on a variety of seals from Kish.58 It was already known in Early Dynastic II, but the examples from cemetery A are all later in style. In one case from mound A it is combined with a scene of building.59 This seal, and an unusual scene of animal sacrifice on a cylinder seal from grave 7, may belong to Early Dynastic IIIB. As has already been suggested the seals, usually of lapis lazuli, cut with geometric designs are also late.80 The pottery from the graves is remarkably homogeneous."' The range of vessels is wide, but during the life-time of the cemetery there were no radical innovations in form or decoration. Contrast with the pottery from graves in the Y sounding below the 'Flood Stratum', all earlier than Early Dynastic IIIA, is marked and only in a relatively few cases are the forms strikingly alike. For chronological purposes four ceramic types from mound A are of particular importance: Mackay's A, B, D and G. As type G has already been discussed (see p. 92 ), it remains but to consider the others. The so-called ' mother-goddess handled jars ' with a single upright anthro- pomorphically decorated handle on the shoulder (Type A) remain the most distinctive feature of cemetery A and contemporary graves on Tell Ingharra, where handles were more commonly reported than complete vessels. Isolated handles have also been reported from Tell Uhaimir. On the basis of finds in the Diyala Delougaz traced a development from short, geometrically decorated handles (ED II) to taller geometric or 'sprig' decorated handles (ED IIIA), and finally to handles decorated with applied human features (ED IIIB).62 The jars from cemetery A are virtually all of the later type with applied human features on the handles, high necks and pronounced ledge-rims. This type of vessel was found only in six graves at Khafajah, all associated with ' Houses 2 or I ', dated from Early Dynastic IIIB into the Akkadian period." But the best specimens came from the surface of mound A at Khafajah, again em- phasizing their place late in the Early Dynastic sequence. At Tell Asmar they occurred in house levels attributed to the Proto-Imperial period.64 At Mari, Fara and at Tell al-Wilayah65 similar handles and jars were found in contexts which may be dated late in the Early Dynastic or very early in the Akkadian 17 Amiet, S8.

Examples from Susa are closest in form to those of the Proto-Imperial period from the Diyala region.66 At Ur a single isolated example, not so richly decorated as most of those from Kish, was found in a grave (PG/778) which Nissen has attributed to Early Dynastic IIIB.67 Another object from Ur throws interesting light on the possible significance of these extraordinary jars. In grave PG/895 close to the skull lay a baked clay female figurine, rendered in far more detail than the handles from Kish, which appeared to Woolley to have been broken off a vessel. It was associated with an offering stand. No other grave at Ur contained a similar object. Nissen placed this grave in the earliest Akkadian period and Madame Barrelet has noted the figurine's Akkadian affinities.68 In the Early Dynastic period baked clay, nude female figurines were rare. This is the more striking since they are common objects in almost every other period. It is possible that the popularity of ' goddess-handled jars ' in cemetery A and on Ingharra has an intimate, if now obscure, link with the cult of Ishtar, whose temple was to be, if not already, one of the glories of ancient Ehursagkalamma. A ' mother-goddess ' figurine, in reality perhaps a doll, was found in a child's grave of Early Dynastic I at Khafajah.69 The 'fruit-stands' (Type B) of cemetery A are the lower, broader type regarded as late on the Diyala sites, where such vessels had already become relatively rare by the Proto-Imperial period. 70 These vessels appear in slightly variant form at Ur, Mari, Fara and Susa in the later phases of the Early Dynastic period and possibly into the early Akkadian period.71 Scattered evidence from sites like Bismaya and Tello indicates that they had a wider currency than the ' goddess-handled ' jars.72 The persistent close association of these two types of vessel at Kish is striking. The decoration of a stand from Ur may offer a partial explanation. Incised on the stem are two palm-trees, the door- ways of two shrines flanked by a pair of poles with single side loops and two incised triangles standing for the female pudenda, exactly as on the handles of certain vessels from Kish.73 The functional affinity of the two vessel types is epitomized in the baked clay ' cult-wagon ' from Sin Temple VIII at Khafajah, where a ' fruit-stand ' is set above a pair of upright handled jars, all mounted on a wheeled platform. The decoration of these stands at Kish is entirely geometric and very simple in cemetery A, but a rather larger damaged stand was found by Watelin on Ingharra (Plate XVI) with an elaborately decorated stem.74 On the base are incised a tortoise and a lion threatening a man, above, " L.

MOOREY on the stem, a hero holding a pole with single side-loop and a snake flanking what was probably a shrine fasade.75 At Mari these stands were found in graves, in temples and in what may have been private houses.78 During the course of Early Dynastic III spouted vessels (Type D), which had been a regular feature of the ceramic tradition of central Iraq since the Proto-Literate period, became progressively rarer and the older forms had disappeared by the Proto-Imperial period. In the Diyala only one fresh type of spouted jar appears in the Proto-Imperial period; a similar form is often reported from mound A at Kish, but not from graves.77 Spouted vessels are relatively rare in the cemetery, appearing only in graves 23, 24, 8I, 87(2), 96(2) and 149. But there is no reason on that account alone to regard these graves as particularly early. In graves 23, 87 and 96 they were associated with fully developed 'goddess-handled' jars; indeed grave 87 was distinguished by the greatest variety of pottery found in a single grave. Grave 23 contained three cylinder seals which might all arguably be attributed to Early Dynastic IIIB. Mound A yielded a variety of vessels and sherds which would fall within Delougaz's class of ' ribbed and studded ' ware, first encountered in Early Dynastic III, but particularly characteristic of Proto-Imperial contexts in the Diyala region.78 Ribbed jars and bowls were dassified by Mackay as Type P. They come mainly from unassociated contexts, but four examples were found in three graves: 62, 87 and IO6(2). The small globular jars of ' studded ware ' found in the Diyala were not recorded from mound A, though they occur elsewhere at Kish,79 but a number of vessels with simpler applique decoration were. Outstanding among these are the shallow ' bowls ', round or oval, decorated on the outside with simple geometric and floral patterns.80 They are not reported in grave-groups. In the Diyala such vessels range in date from the later Early Dynastic III to the Akkadian period.8' As with so many of the pottery forms distinctive of central Iraq in this period close parallels may be found at Susa. Apart from these more distinctive ceramic types cemetery A contained a wide range of ordinary pottery. Virtually all the forms classified by Mackay may be matched in the Diyala, as Delougaz's comparative charts make clear. Little pottery of this period has yet been published from Mari, but one find there is of particular interest. Some distance along the street running by the west side of the Ninni-zaza Temple a remarkable pottery model of a courtyard house was found below the oldest road surface. Pottery vessels were packed 7 Amied, nos. I 284, I287-1290. 76 A. Parrot, Le Temple d'Ishtar, 2I3 if. 77Delougat, io6: C.556.322; cf. AM pi.

It would be idle with the meagre evidence available to speculate on the function of this remarkable model, but it is relevant to the present discussion for two reasons. In the first place it indicates that whatever the possible ritual use of the' goddess- handled' jars and the ' fruit-stands ', the other pottery from the graves repre- sents a typical selection of household wares. The model itself offers some general indication of the elevation of the larger houses contemporary with cemetery A. The minor objects from cemetery A are of considerable interest for the light they throw on the technology and taste of the cemetery's occupants, but they do not offer chronological evidence to compare with that of the seals and the pottery. As such finds from the Diyala sites are still unpublished, resort must still be made to Ur for parallels. In this case they are far more common than with the pottery, as ceramic traditions vary more markedly from area to area than do the more specialist crafts of metalsmnith and jeweller, regularly using imported materials which would often have reached Kish by river and canal from cities like Ur in the south. Only the axes and pins yield some definite chronological information. The cast bronze shaft-hole axes are paralleled at Ur in graves of the late Early Dynastic or Early Akkadian period.83 At Ur the pin type found in graves 52, 102, 104 and I07 at Kish was specifically early Akkadian, whilst that in graves i 2, 40, I I I, 117 etc. with a bent head was more distinctive of Early Dynastic IIIA.4 B: Graves on Tell Ingharra contemporary with cemetery A: From late in December I925 to March I926 Mackay cut a series of trenches between mound A and Ingharra and further to the north still on the southern slopes of mound E in an area designated ISW and later fully explored by Watelin.85 Here Mackay regularly encountered, a metre or so below the surface, disturbed graves and scattered artefacts exactly like those found in previous seasons on mound A. None of his trenches seem to have provided evidence for any concentration of burials as on mound A so it must be assumed that a wide area in this vicinity was uninhabited at the same time and used intermittently for burials. In only two respects did these new finds increase knowledge of the period. In reporting cemetery A Mackay was insistent that ' not a single painted jar or fragment of one was found ',86 but a number of 8I A. Parrot, Le Temples d'Isbtarat et de Ninni-rZata, 293 if., pl.

MOOREY vessels from ISW, attributed by him to the same period as cemetery A, are described as painted (Field No. z44i*) or more explicitly as ' coated with a slip now powdery and painted red' (Field No. 244 5p ) or ' washed over with a thin red colour ' (Field No. 2465 *). In ISW he also found a jar of 'A' cemetery type containing contemporary gold, silver, copper, carnelian, onyx and lapis lazuli beads (Field Nos. 2970*, 2988*), which may well be a true hoard robbed from graves rather than a burial deposit. When Watelin succeeded Mackay as field director in I926 he naturally lacked Mackay's detailed knowledge of earlier finds and consequently his cataloguing is by no means so easy to follow. Yet it is clear that throughout his work on the main group of mounds at Ingharra in the next few years he regularly found further evidence for burials contemporary with those in mound A. Only on one occasion during his first season, I926-27, did he record a grave-group of this period. This lay four metres below the surface in trench B, a broad swathe cut along the south-east side of the Neo-Babylonian temple. Apart from skeletal material it contained a jar of type C, another of type E, a stone bowl, a copper pin, a long-baked clay bead and a frit handle (Field Nos. X.I89-i94). It was only -in his second season, I927-8, that he recorded three grave-groups whose contents and stratigraphical position have a vital bearing on the archae- ology of cemetery A as a whole. Watelin referred briefly to these graves in publishing a preliminary report on his work;87 a detailed inventory will be found here in Appendix II. These three graves lay in the Red Stratum on Tell Ingharra.88 The cylinder seal from grave 306 provides certain evidence that the use of this area as a cemetery extended into the Akkadian period.89 When the other contents of these three graves are compared with the grave-groups of mound A they do not differ save in a greater concentration of fine and precious objects. When excavating the earlier graves in the Y sounding Watelin found that the most richly equipped lay nearest to, and under, the later Z;iggurat platform. It may well be that late in Early Dynastic IIIB and in the Early Akkadian period social distinction carried with it the right to be buried in close proximity to the religious buildings on Ingharra. Apart from these three graves objects identical to those from the graves of cemetery A are scattered through the finds catalogued, primarily from area Z, during the excavations of I927-8. Of these the most characteristic are the anthropomorphic baked-clay jar handles (Field nos. Y.26, 64, 68, I0 5-7, 22 5-6, 230, 248, 265, 300-2), bronze or copper toilet sets (Field nos. Y.76a, b, 103, 128), silver roundels (Field no. Y.76c) and 'handles' of white alabaster inlaid with bitumen (Y.I5I, 234-both with other objects and clearly disturbed grave- groups). Inlay fragments in shell and stone like those from palace A were also found in area Z and trench B.3 (Field nos. Y.459-464, 485).

Y.162, 328; cf. AM I, pl. XLV, 3-4), where one outstanding baked clay stand was also found (Field no. Y.77; Plate XVI). A unique object from grave 317 deserves more than passing mention. This ivory stand was considerably more complex than Watelin allowed in describing it as ' consisting of two small bearded human-headed bulls ... mounted stand- ing parallel on a pedestal supported by wheels . . . only one of the bulls could be preserved'.90 The restored bull (7.5 cm. long; 5.5. cm. high as extant) and the pedestal of the same or another bull are now displayed in the National Museum of Antiquities, Baghdad, as on Plate XVII. It will be seen that only three hooves are represented standing on the pedestal; the right front hoof is absent. There is a deep rectangular socket in the bull's neck, not visible in the photograph. The upper neck is pierced with a tiny hole and the back of the head is cut back to form a small ledge. The original form of the object may be gauged to some extent from the surviving body fragments (Baghdad Museum no. IM 5765). These include the left shoulder and much of the body of another bull, most of the right shoulder of a bull which does not belong with the previous piece, part of the left shoulder and body of yet another bull, for there seems to be no connection with either of the previous animals, and a rather battered head with a bearded human face exactly as on the complete bull. There seems little doubt that there were originally four bulls. There were certainly three. Apart from the evidence of the platforms to be considered in a moment, the almost certain absence of any relation between the left and right shoulder fragments leads me to postulate a fourth. Though very damaged the fragments of platforms may be restored to make a second complete one and two very damaged ones. When it is possible to tell, only three hooves stood flush with the top of each platform. Certain fragments provide a clue to the destination of the fourth hoof. It seems that the front knee, probably the right in two cases, the left in two cases, was bent, as on two surviving examples, and the hoof set on foliage rising from the platform. One hoof resting on a frag- ment of foliage and one fragment of a platform with painted foliage and dismembered leaves survive. The leaves are painted black and picked out in red. Isolated vestiges of paint indicate that at least parts of the animals' bodies were similarly treated. The most difficult problem to resolve with these figures is their final arrange- ment on four self-contained platforms. The presence of a number of finished edges suggests that each bull stood independently on its own rectangular platform (approx. 7.5 cm. long, z.o cm. wide and 1.5 cm. high). The due to their assemblage may lie in the small holes, 0.3 cm. wide, which are pierced horizontally through each pedestal half way between front and back. It was 90 XK IV, 5O. (10396) B2</page><page sequence="20">103 P. R. S. MOOREY these no doubt which led Watelin to suggest that the platforms were wheeled. He may, if it really belongs here, have been strengthened in this view by a small circular domed disc of ivory (?) with a central boring now stored with IM 5 765. In appearance it is more like the many 'spindle-whorls' found at Kish than it is like a model wheel. None of the holes pierced in the platforms bear traces of wear on their edges and seem too small to take an axle large enough to support wheels for a model of this size. The bulls are best seen standing flat on the ground, or more probably on some table or stand, set at the four corners or evenly spaced round the base of another object which rested in the sockets cut into the back of their necks. Of this nothing has survived. It is possible to take our knowledge of this object slighdy further. A number of decorated shell inlay plaques found in the Royal Cemetery at Ur show bulls and goats rampant over foliage rendered exactly as on this stand.91 On seals human-headed bulls are commonly grouped in pairs,92 whilst bulls, natural and anthropomorphic, were used as decorative pedestals for stone vases. The use of ivory for this stand, and for combs in these graves, is of more than passing interest. Ivory is not often reported from the Early Dynastic period, though later it is well documented at Ur.93 The two naked female figurines from Mari, a similar figure from Tell al-Wilayah and the ivory figurine fragments from level G at Assur94 indicate that this material was probably more common late in the Early Dynastic period than surviving evidence allows. The comparative rarity of nude figurines of women in the Early Dynastic period might suggest these objects were not of Sumerian manu- facture, but the bulls, indisputably Sumerian in style, certainly were. C: Conclusions: the sequence of burials at Kish (Ingharra area) in the Early Dynastic period. The sequence of grave-groups from Tell Ingharra and Mound A at Kish may now be established with reasonable certainty, though much remains to be done in refining the evidence from the Y sounding.9" In the so-called Y cemetery there were three main groups of superimposed graves. What is probably the largest group lay at 5-6 metres below the ' Plain Level' in rumined houses of Early Dynastic I. Another group, at about four metres below the ' Plain Level ', represent the final series of interments in the area before the Flood in the course of Early Dynastic II. In the final phase of Early Dynastic II or very early in IIIA the chariot burials were sunk from a level above the 91 C. L. Woolley, UE II, p1. IOO: U.IO9I7A; P1. 104: U.IO412; 12353.

These burials are almost certainly contemporary with palace A. This palace and the zig- gurats with their associated religious buildings on Tell Ingharra flourished in Early Dynastic IIIA-B. Then some disaster led to their abandonment and erosion. Across the ruins late in Early Dynastic HIB and through into the Akkadian period extended a cemetery and intermittent dwellings of no great substance. The reconstruction of this area towards the end of the Akkadian period is represented by scattered documentary evidence and possibly by the earliest phase of' Monument Z '.97 The life of cemetery A was, I submit, relatively brief; no more than a century or so. Absolute dates are hazardous, but on current reckoning this would extend from C. 2400-2300 B.C. Even if the archaeological material as published will bear the precise statistical interpretation given it by Hrouda and Karstens, and this is open to very real doubt, it does not allow for the very broad chrono- logical spread they give the cemetery. If the four groups the' distinguish in the life of the cemetery really are chronological phases, and not sociological distinctions, then they reflect modifications of material culture and funerary practice during the declining years of Early Dynastic III and the advent of the Akkadian supremacy, not the final flowering of Sumerian culture from the end of Early Dynastic II through to IIIB. Cemetery A is important in that it provides an extensive range of evidence for the material culture of central Iraq in a period, nothing like so adequately represented in the Diyala region, which was of vital importance in the country's history. During this time the loosely linked city-states of the Sumerian south passed under the political hegemony of the Akkadians led by a man intimately associated with Kish. Notes on Appendix I i. This appendix is designed to be used in direct conjunction with Mackay's reports in AM I(i), I(z) to which constant reference is made by page and plate number. The excavator's field-numbers for the objects are given in brackets. The objects were divided into three collections, regardless of grave-groups, and sent to the National Museum of Antiquities in Baghdad, the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago. 2. It will be apparent to users of AM I(z) that the pottery groups were broken down by the use of letters in the field-records, e.g. grave I-647 A-I; as these letters do not refer to the typological series later devised for publication I have omitted them to avoid confusion with the typological sequence A-S. This does not in any way affect the archaeological record. 'l There seems little doubt of this now; both Gibson and Lloyd, Iraq 31 (I969), pl. VII endorse my earlier suggestion.
