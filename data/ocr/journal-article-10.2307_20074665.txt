<plain_text><page sequence="1">Exhibition Reviews James Pryde London by MERLIN JAMES in the world as painted by James Pryde (i 866-1941), everything is profoundly pr? existent. Nothing is new, nothing emergent. Bu?dings are in archaic styles, and of indeter minate vintage. Trees are ancient, massive. Costume is 'historical'. Everyone is a famiHar type ? urchin, outlaw and peasant; dandy, maiden and bonhomme. Pryde's theatricaHty is often noted: figures come on Hke actors on shaUow platforms, playing out parts. They are Ht by pools and shafts of Hght under prosce nium architecture with stagey drapes and rigging. But this theatricaHty most important ly creates (and stems from) the sense that everything is precast, rehearsed, re-enacted. Events and locations seem d?j? vu, even when ambiguous or anonymous. Objects and fea tures are Hke props or sets just because Pryde characterises them so typicaUy and genericaUy. If the backdrop seems to recede with the famiHar repouss? features and aerial perspectives of the scene-painter, it is largely because the setting is so archetypal - idylHc glade, pic turesque fountain, murky aUeyway, formal garden or windswept moor. Related to Pryde's archaism is the fact that he is one of those twentieth-century painters who managed to make significant work that owes no debt to C?zanne. (Unsurprisingly CHve BeU dismissed his paintings as 'not so much pictures as playhouse projects'.)1 Cezanne's breakthrough of course involved abandoning many traits sirn?ar to those with which Pryde persevered - melodrama, histor ical fantasy, burlesque-Baroque handling. And subsequent modernist pioneers had to shrug off analogously iUustrative, morbid and atavis tic manners. What makes Pryde more than a d?mod? academic (many an RA kept producing 'fancy' subjects in Edwardian styles) is how consciously he embraced the anachronism and artificiaHty that Modernism rejected. He seems to dissect those pictorial cHch?s and conven tions ? endlessly refined, re-elaborated, then worn down to tokens again ? that evolved through the Renaissance, the Baroque, Neo classicism and Romanticism. This decadence is embodied in the decom position and dilapidation evident in his motifs: rags, tatters, coUapsing towers, battered and broken statues, empty sheUs of buildings with gaping embrasures (Fig. 60) and demoHshed curtain waUs. What Httle construction occurs is usuaUy of some makeshift, temporary framework amid more general decHne and dereHction. Or it is the raising of a memorial to past deeds and figures (Fig.61). Colour is paUid, faded; shadows lengthen; surfaces flake 6o. The husk, by James Pryde. Late 1910s or early 1920s. Canvas, 151 by 141 cm. (The Hon. Charles Pearson; exh. The Fleming Collection, London). and crumble. BeU, disHking Pryde's refusal of modern, healthy, progressive animism, doubted if'the seeds of life' were there. There is indeed an almost necrophiHac quaHty in works such as his series of gaunt, impossibly elongated four-posters, in peeHng rooms vis ited by squaHd or pathetic figures, suggesting death-bed vigils, or some macabre return to sites of tragedy and loss. Tides include The slum; Haunted house; The derelict; The ragged room; Sinister interior, The deserted garden; The grave; The ghost ship. Conscious anachronism is written into the deeper structure of his paintings, in his insistence on traditional genre forms and his aUusions to past art. Manet and Daumier are invoked, in turn recalling Velazquez, Goya and others. Guardi's architectural caprices, Watteau's never-never-lands, Hubert Robert's ruins and many artists' Grand Tour o?-sketch es of the ItaHan campagna aU come to mind. AU are deeply retrospective in attitude. Ruisdael's casdes and cemeteries, the picturesque low-life scenes of the Bamboccianti, Salvator Rosa's haunted landscapes and Piranesi's prisons are equaUy summoned up. Pryde's work is unapologeticaUy a concoction. His stained and gashed buildings are anthropomorphic, metaphorising human trauma.2 EquaUy signif icant is the evident 'squaring up' from smaU sketches or other sources onto the canvas, the dabbing of broad paint areas onto coarse Hnen suggesting almost a print or transfer quaHty ? aU implying imagery not so much created by the artist as reproduced, reported, reprised with detached sangfroid. Sickert of course was a master of similar methods, and wh?e Pryde was something of a maverick, he does (a Httle like his eccentric American contemporary Louis E?shemius) connect significandy with aspects of Modernism. His affinities with SurreaHst and ItaHan metaphysical painting, especiaUy de Chirico, have long been recog nised. Neo-romantics Hke Eug?ne Berman, Michael Ayrton and John Piper aU come close to him (Piper acknowledging the debt). THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE CXLVIII DECEMBER 2?0? 86l</page><page sequence="2">EXHIBITION REVIEWS 6i. Construction (The unveiling of the Duke of York's column), by James Pryde. c.1910. Canvas, 98.5 by 72.5 cm. (The Hon. Charles Pearson; exh. The Fleming Collection, London). Pryde's materiaHty, self-referentiaHty and for maHsm are also undeniable. Pryde shows are rare, and the exhibition at the Fleming Collection, London (to 16th December), assembling some sixty works from pubHc and private coUections, is his first serious airing for almost fifteen years. It includes some of his Portraits of Celebrated Criminals, pubHshed in 1907 as a suite of Hthographs, rather like 'wanted' posters, and many rarely seen canvas es from the group stiU at Dunecht House in Scodand, commissioned by Lady Cowdray in the early decades of the twentieth century. There may be a poetic appropriateness to Pryde's continued obscurity (Dunecht, with ruins in the grounds and its own legends of death and grave-robbing, is now 'closed up'). But his re-exposure is timely, and indeed it would be good to see a show of his work tour to more contemporary spaces, the Fleming CoUection's galleries being, again, a rather paneUed and plush environment. Undeniably, this artist is relevant today when malaise, detachment and morbidity are de rigueur for much currendy fashionable painting. Significandy, though, Pryde came to the conclusion that his endgame was finite. He gradually stopped work, leaving on his easel a grand unfinished work, The death of the great bed. He had memorably marked the passing of painting long before its proclaimed demise in abstraction, and long before postmodernism's invasion of the un-dead. 1 Quoted in the exhibition catalogue: Rascals and Ruins: the Romantic Vision of James Pryde.
