<plain_text><page sequence="1">SERRABONNE: THE CHURCH AND THE SCULPTURE MILTON D. LOWENSTEIN HALFWAY ALONG the road from Perpignan to Villefranche, just beyond Ille-sur-Tet, lies the village of Bouleternere. The main road through the village follows the ancient border that divided the lands of Castelnou's viscounts on the east from the lands controlled by the Cortsavi lords on the west side. The tortuous way southward along the steep valley climbs the watershed to the ridge beyond which lies the valley of the Tech. Five or six kilometers from Bouleternere, and before reaching the small hamlet of Boule d'Amont, a caretaker's stone cottage on the left side of the road and a spring on the right mark the beginning of a trail that zigzags west- ward up the mountains to the ancient priory of Serra- bonne (Serrabone, Latin Serrabona). The trail is recently cut in the dry and hard soil and where the moss and lichens have not held against erosion of water and frost the bare schists and granite stand harshly exposed. Gnarled roots of a kind of scrub-oak, exfoliated cork trees and ancient sterile trunks that once bore olives add their testi- mony to the grim reality of Pyrenean existence. Unexpectedly, above and to the side of the trail ahead, foreshortened to a narrow curving band and mostly hidden by a shelf of rock on which it rests, the church apse swings gently out into space (Fig. 1). A small chapel may have occupied the site before the Augustin Canons received aid and started a church which was consecrated in 1082. Among those who contributed were the Viscount of Cer- dagne, his brother Bernard, Viscount of Berga, a certain Bernard Raimond and Raimond Matfred, lord of Cortsavi. In all, 30 dextres of land were given to the church.1 The founders were of the same family which had been associated with events at St. Michel de Cuxa and St. Martin du Canigou. The first prior elected to office was Raimond Ermengaud, March 3, 1082.2 Serrabonne consisted at this time of a nave and a single apse with living quarters at the west end. Until about the middle of the twelfth century the church plan resembled that of Serralongue, a priory about 8 kilometers southwest of Arles-sur-Tech. The church was altered after its first consecration. The remodeling involved demolishing the apse, extending the nave and adding side aisles which terminated in small apses, rectangular on the outside (Fig. 2). This type of apse may be seen at Corneilla de Conflent (consecrated 1095), Espira d'Agly (consecrated 1130), and Montbolo, (built in the eleventh century). All these churches have a wider nave than Serrabonne and refinements which may have been due to their greater accessibility to centers of commerce and culture. The north aisle of the church serves as a narthex. It has a semicircular barrel vault. The south aisle, an open gallery, has a wooden roof. On November 8, 1151 (October 25, according to the modern calendar), Pierre Bernard, Bishop of Elne, con- secrated the church again. The bishop confirmed all of the priory's possessions, including the cemeteries of the churches of St. Jean d'Arsons, St. Nazaire de Barbadell and the churches of Vilella, Joch and Marinyans. The Bishop of Urgell confirmed the priory's possession of Urg and of Ur.3 The design of the church as it stands today is believed to be the same as the one consecrated in 1151.4 Fenestra- tion is limited to a few windows of the loophole type. No openings, except the entrance, occur in the north fagade (Fig. 3). Each of the apses has one window and the south transept and clerestory have each one. The cornice of the conical apse roof rests on corbels. A saw-tooth band around the apse helps emphasize the rotundity (Fig. 1). The west wall is all but demolished and is indistinguishable from the rubble of the ruined living quarters (Fig. 4). There may have been a small window in the wall sufficiently high to clear the buildings on the west side of the church. A modern west wall, to the east of the old one, contains a large window which provides illumination for the famous tribune at the end of the nave. The tower projects slightly in front of the north wall and is in a position to help in the defense of the entrance (Fig. 2). The exterior arrangement of the functional elements is extremely impressive. The composition becomes more ex- citing if advantage is taken of the various levels from which the building may be studied, allowing it to be seen above, at and below eye level. The composition of horizontal prisms of the nave and side aisles, joined at one end to a MILTON D. LOWENSTEIN is an architect, engineer and teacher. He is now completing a cinematographic analysis of traditional archi- tectural forms. Serrabonne 7</page><page sequence="2">cone-capped semi-circular apse, and at the other end to the vertical mass of the tower adds an anthropormorphic dimension to the dynamics of the mountainous terrain. The unit building material is a rectangular block of schist varying slightly in size according to its position in the wall. From ground level to about shoulder height the blocks require two or three men to lift each piece into place. The schist is hard, containing some mica, but gen- erally tending toward the gneiss variety. It is closely laminated and mostly laid on its natural bed for the first few courses, except the lower part of the transepts and apses which are face-bedded. The remainder of the walls have smaller stones bedded in any of the three possible positions. Dry joints are used in the lower courses and mortar in the upper courses which are about three-quarters of an inch thick. (Repointing has made it impossible to determine the exact thickness.) The plan shows three apses, transept, choir and nave with side aisles and a tower (Fig. 2). A study of the orthographic projections of plan and sections reveal some interesting mathematical relationships between the func- tional elements. In the order in which they are seen when entering the north door, the north aisle, or narthex, transept and choir are related in width, as 3.2 : 4.3 : 5.3; in length, as 14 : 14 : 14; in height as 4.1 : 6 : 10.1. These figures also give the absolute dimensions in meters. Combining the plan with the section, the corresponding volume relationships may be obtained. The volumes of the functional elements are defined as follows: the north aisle, from the entrance across the transept to the small apse, at a uniform height; the transept, from the north to the south wall, at the height of the transept arms; the choir, westward from the large apse to the screen wall in the nave, at a uniform height. The volumes as defined above are related as, 143 m3 : 340 m3 : 800 m3. The transept volume is approximately a mean proportion between the aisle and the choir-apse volumes. The relationships of sizes may be fortuitous or they may have been planned. A possible explanation, if they were planned, is as follows: Lengths are experienced chiefly kinesthetically in the course of circulation. Width, on the other hand, as well as height and volume, can be perceived only visually, which usually occurs while at rest. Where kinesthetic perception predominates, the relationship of 1 : 1 : 1 for lengths tends to minimize travel distances. Where vision is the prime source of experience, scale per- ception is aided by the harmonious relationships of 3 : 4 : 5 for widths; 2 : 3 : 5 for heights, and the transept's volume relation in a mean proportion. Circulation is started in the dimly lit narthex by the light from the small window in the north apse. At the north arm of the transept another small window in the south transept directs the attention toward the south apse and aisle. The south aisle, instead of being a dark corridor, like the north, is an open, sun-warmed gallery (Fig. 4). Walking along this abbreviated cloister, the vision becomes focused on the slopes of Les Asperes. Seen through the ar- cade even the grim ridges partake of the rhythmic move- ment of the walk. The granite worn green hills, flecked with tiny tufts of grazing sheep are reflected in the blue above the undulating line of the horizon. Cumulus clouds drift lazily against the counter-point of striated cirrus webs stretched above the highest icy peaks. Nature, no longer mute or rampant, but easily scaled by the church archi- tecture, falls into the place allotted it by a medieval hand. Close to eye level, the arcade's weathered capitals glow and fade with fluctuations of delicate cloud shadows. Orange and rich browns of the highlights evoke blues and purples from the deeper hollows of the carving. SCULPTURE The media for fine work, together with examples of superior craftsmanship and the latest tools, seem to have been available in eleventh- and twelfth-century Roussillon. The best marble in France comes from the Pyrenees: white- blue from Ceret, pink from Villefranche and white-gray from Baixas. Examples of Saracen work must have man- aged to cross the borders. The bevel and trough techniques of Andalusian sculptors, and the circular drill or trepan and right angle cut of Cordovan sculptors, are seen in the work at Serrabonne and St. Michel de Cuxa. The capitals used in the entrances and cloisters of all the small churches in Roussillon have about the same dimen- sions. Their size suggests that ease of transportation was an important consideration. The capitals weigh approxi- mately 50 kilograms apiece, and the abacus about half as much. The units are convenient for carrying in pairs slung over a donkey's back. The unit is also one which can be comfortably handled by the individual sculptor who re- quires no assistance to move or cut the stone. He can kneel over the piece as it lies blocked up on another stone and work with chisel or drill while maintaining a posi- tion convenient for gauging scale and symmetry. The two columns, one on either side of the entrance at Serrabonne, have marble capitals which, like those in the south gallery, are at about eye level (Fig. 3). A carved corbel serves as abacus for the capitals and joins them to the schist walls of the church. The abacus also serves as impost for the tubular archivolt over the door. The capital to the left of the door contains the figure of the Christ giving a benediction (Fig. 3). He is flanked by two angels whose enlarged heads mark the corners of the capital. The central figure has been compared with the scultpure on either side of the doorway at St. Michel de Cuxa." The squat figure at Serrabonne introduces the change from the straight line of the column to the curve of the tubular-shaped archivolt; at St. Michel, the elongated 8 Journal of The Society of Architectural Historians, XII, 3</page><page sequence="3">Peter and Paul bas-reliefs emphasize the supporting func- tion of the pier to which they are attached. The Serrabonne figure appears more mobile and plastically alive in its gesture of benediction and refreshingly indicative of inner strength. The capital to the right of the door is also carved in high relief. It consists of a two-bodied lion whose single head forms the corner of the capital. This motif is one that is frequently used at Serrabonne and St. Michel. The beasts balanced on the edge of the twisted astragal seem as un- comfortable as the spectator becomes after observing the capital for a time! At the west end of the nave is the tribune which is con- sidered to be one of the best pieces of Roussillon art. It is believed by Durliat and others that the sculpture originated at St. Michel de Cuxa and was transported to Serrabonne. This observation does not explain the existence of the capitals in the north door which are built into the wall of the church through the abacus-corbel. These capitals are of the same material as that used for the tribune, and ex- cept for the superiority of the capital on the left of the entrance, the workmanship is the same as that in the tribune. The first view of the tribune, dimly seen under the heavy arch of the nave wall, gives the impression of a crypt (Figs. 5 and 6). No other small church tribune ever re- ceived such elaborate treatment of its supports and fagade. It is difficult to believe that a mere balcony rests on that maze of beautifully carved marble! But attempts at func- tional analysis cease when, on turning westward from the entrance, the end of the nave is reached. The dazzling tribune facade stands suddenly revealed in the light stream- ing through the large window in the west wall (Fig. 7). The marble has retained the pink glow of freshly cut work. Unlike the exposed capitals on the building's exterior, there are no weathered shades of orange and grays. Bounded by the rough, unfinished sides of the nave, the whole marble fagade bubbles up out of the smoothly worn pavement like a spring of glistening water in a huge well- house. The tribune, consisting of six bays of cross-ribbed vaults each having a span of 1.75 m., is usually regarded as not always occupying its present position. There seems to be little agreement as to the original position of the present balcony." Serrabonne's isolated location makes the elabo- rate tribune seem anomalous. While there is a contempo- rary example of a tribune in a small church in Roussillon, e.g., Sequere, the support there is a single barrel vault and not a series of ribbed vaults resting on small columns. One theory for the tribune is that its present orientation was reversed and it was situated further west against the end wall of the church. Such a position would relate the tribune to a stairs in the south aisle, at the west end of which is the remnant of a riser. The individual pieces do not fit together. Some have been broken to make them fit in their present place. The joints of the courses under the saw-tooth band do not come over the supporting corbels. The piers are clumsily joined to the church walls. In the case of the north pier capital, the parts of it obviously do not belong together. The varia- tion in the thickness of the astragal on the west side and the awkward relationship of the figures on the two seg- ments indicate that the parts were intended to be com- bined differently. The span of the vault bays has no rela- tion to the dimensions of the nave into which the tribune is fitted. The voussoirs of the vaulting ribs are not properly joined to each other or to their imposts. Despite these general incongruities it seems that the pieces of the tribune belonged at one time to some one feature of the church. This part of the building was worked on by craftsmen of different skill. For example, the ter- minal piers of the facade are superficially alike, but close inspection reveals that the northern pier is an example of a better class of work than the southern pier. Both piers are the same variation on the theme of a man versus wild beasts and both tend to be symmetrical in the arrangement of solids and voids. The sculpture on the north pier contains robust figures that are rendered in surfaces suggesting living organisms beneath them. The curves seem to be formed from a com- plex of inner surging forces. Even the stereotype mane and ribs and pleated skirt are lifted out of their conventional roles and made plastic by subtle variations. Each detail be- longs uniquely to a particular moment of the drama por- trayed. The contribution of the sculpture to an architectural function is indicated by the solid carved masses at the corners which furnish an adequate base for the abacus. As a composition, the sculpture reinforces the impression that the top of the pier receives the weight of the vault's transverse and diagonal ribs. The sculpture on the south pier has the same subject, but the expression has become banal in the hands of an untalented dull copyist. The figures are lifeless symbols executed by one who knows his tools and material, but whose limited imagination seems stimulated only by a technique. The details do not enhance a single idea but are allowed to go each its own way. Voids are awkward corners filled with irrelevant details, and solids are stretched out with little regard for their plastic values. Relationships between the parts seem forced and the composition de- pends almost exclusively on symmetry. The architectural functions are barely suggested, two little knobs appearing at the corners where a strong emphasis is expected. The tribune facade may be divided into (1) the three courses of the cornice which rests on a row of equally spaced corbels; (2) spandrels which separate the three arches; and (3) the voussoirs of the arches (Fig. 7). The top course of the cornice is the smallest size of the Serrabonne 9</page><page sequence="4">jjijjjji~iiii...... ..... ... iiiiiiiiiiii i -i-:i : i:::i:.......... .iii ..................... ili:-iriii iiiriiiii'il iri~l i . . i-iiii - :'............ iiiiii?!i~iiii'iiiiifiii'i~iii'::i i-iiiiiii i i i Biiiiiii~~iiii~ iii i!iiiiiii iiiiii~iiii iiiiiiiii i i i :?: iii~ii~!!ii~iiilii~iisiii i,:!i!!iiiiiiiiiiiiiii ... ... . . . . .. . . . 21-~!j:I:-:::---:~-:W: iiiil~iii''~iii~iiiiiiiiii :::::I::-:-- -::::::::~~i~~41W ::1;:;~11:11::-:::::-::-:::i~i::Us ::::i:::::::::::::::.............. :: FIG. 1.

The carving is executed on a cavetto profile which gives a soft shadow, and helps relate the fagade to the dark vaulted space above the balcony. The small carved heads of the corbels possess an unusual intensity of expression. Architecturally, the effect is not satisfactory because the joints of the cornice do not fall over the heads. The flower pattern between the corbels is slightly larger than the one on the cornice. The spandrel over the north pier consists of one large block filled principally with the figures of two angels, four blocks containing the flower pattern and one block containing the head of an angel protruding as a boss from the surface of the fagade. The carving in general is in lower relief than that at St. Michel de Cuxa where similar figures occur. A dance rhythm carries the figures of the angels into the world occupied by characters from the St. Pere de Roda Bible. The angels' heads, and especially the hands, are caught poised for the next movement in the dance's sequence. It seems to be anticipated in the sweep of the folded wings. Below the angels is the protruding head. This "hornblower" is quite like the head in the narthex of VWzelay cathedral; it can also be seen in an illumination of the Beatus Bible (fol. 137, verso, Bib. Na- tionale, Paris). The successful attempt to make the little face vivacious sets this sculpture apart from the rest of the tribune decoration and recalls the excellent craftsman- ship of the Christ on the entrance capital. The next spandrel to the south consists of two blocks with evangelical symbols, two blocks each containing a portion of the flower pattern and one head in the round of an anthropomorphic bear. The evangelical lion and eagle have an authority and dignity which is not evident at St. Michel where the same beasts seem to be more of an after- thought attached to the marble. The bear's head may have been inspired, as was the illumination in Beatus and other manuscripts of the time, by the Book of Daniel where the bear symbolizes the kingdom of Persia. The next spandrel is made up of two blocks, one con- taining the symbol of the Lamb and Cross, and the other the evangelical symbol of St. Matthew. The boss protrud- ing below these blocks is a variation of the bear's head on the previous spandrel. The anagogic symbols of the Savior are inconspicuous and are the only ones in the entire church. The adjoining symbol of St. Matthew is ingeni- ously fitted between the extrados of the arcade voussoirs and a line which curves from the center of the spandrel around to the extrados. The St. Matthew figure which was recently found at St. Michel de Cuxa is also designed to fit under an arch but the pose is stiffer, lacking the mo- bility expressed in the Serrabonne figure. The spandrel at the southern end of the fagade is smaller than the corresponding space at the north end. The symbol of St. Luke almost fills the space. The ox is upright, facing the center of the fagade. The frame follows the figure closely as in the figure of St. Matthew. Below the ox there is a protruding head as in the other three spandrels. An inward twist to the head in this fourth spandrel gives it a smirking expression. The direction of the twist balances the "hornblower" on the opposite end of the fagade where the face is also turned inward. The voussoirs on each of the three arches have different patterns. They share an overlapping leaf pattern which runs along the intrados of each. The center arch shows the most originality in form, the southern arch shows the most ingenuity in craftsmanship and the northern arch, while the most ordinary in design, indicates the crafts- man's sensitivity to the needs of the whole composition. The subjects chosen by the craftsmen do not seem to be the result of attempts to resolve anxieties or project the ideals which so deeply concerned the Gothic artists of the north. Neither is there much evidence of predominately biblical influences as is seen in the cloisters at Elne and Estafiy (Catalonia). The desire of the craftsman to give ex- pression to his concept of the Pyrenean world appears to be the basic motivation for the sculptural forms. The tech- niques employed indicate, sometimes, a kind of uncon- scious attempt to escape from the limitations imposed by a bas-relief world but the better works always respect the architectural requirements and are controlled by them. Like architecture, sculpture is a compromise. It seems al- most too much to expect the craftsman to be bound by Moslem techniques in his craft, Christian precepts in his thinking and the creative demands of his instincts.
