Plate, for the Norddeutscher Lloyd Co. (London: Stanford. 1906. Pp. 293. Maps and Illustrations), is conceived in a more literary style than the ordinary guide-book. Dealing with places of leading interest to tourists in a round tour embracing Ceylon, Further India, the Malay peninsula and archipelago, the Chinese littoral, Japan, etc., it briefly furnishes information of almost encyclopmdic character about each, and should serve its special purpose excellently. THE MONTHLY RECORD. EUROPE. Charles the Great's Passage of the Alps.-In the English HTistorical Review for July last there is an interesting article on the route taken by Charles the Great through the Alps on his march into Lombardy in 773. Hitherto the generally accepted view, based on the authority of the German chronicles, has been that Charles crossed by the Mont Cenis pass. Mr. Coolidge, the author of the article, is able to show, however, that this opinion is probably erroneous, and that Charles really crossed by the Mont Genevre route. His view is based on the fact that the German chroniclers obviously presumed that Charles followed the route taken by his father, Pippin, some years before, while the only two chronicles which show any knowledge of local topography, those of Novalesa and of Ado of Vienne, distinctly etate that Charles went by way of the Mont Genevre. The question is not one of great importance, but, as the author says, it "offers a certain interest to those students who delight in clearing up small historical puzzles." Some Features of the Karst.-The latest student to take up the question of the Karst landscape is Dr. I. V. Danes, who has devoted some time to a thorough examination of the morphological features of the region of the Lower Narenta. He has described the results of his investigations in a detailed report published (in Czech) by the Bohemian Geographical Society, but has made his conclusions more generally available in a German abstract in the Abrege du Bulletin de la Soc. Hongroise de geogr. (1906, No. 8). The first section of the paper is devoted to the " poljes" of the Karst, and Dr. Danes begins by sketching the views which have been held by recent investigators as to their mode of origin. It may be remembered that Dr. Cvijic attached much importance to the removal of material by chemical agencies, chiefly, as he supposed, along the lines of previously existing dislocations. He also considered that the major axis of the poljes coincided in direction with the strike of the rocks. Dr. Alfred Grund, in his 'Karsthydrographie' published in 1903, contested the views of Cviji6, holding that the lines of fracture had no con- nection with the mountain structure, but were merely marginal to the areas of subsidence of the poljes. While not denying that some poljes were formed by the removal of waste material, he considered this to take the ordinary form due to mechanical erosion, the poljes in this case being in part at least drained by open-air channels, and thus not belonging to the category of Karst-poljes in the stricter sense. Grund also attached importance to the gradual sinking of the level of the ground-water, as a condition for the origination of the typical Karst landscape. Dr. Danes, who has investigated several typical Karst-poljes, has come to conclusions differing from those of either of the above writers. He found that the Imotsko 455</page><page sequence="2">456 THE MONTHLY RECORD. polje, the largest of those examined, is not primarily the result of dislocation and subsidence, but rather of the removal of easily eroded Eocene strata, though tectonic processes and chemical solution may have had their effect later. The Eocene strata have been subject to strong erosion throughout the region, and the writer is inclined to attribute the formation of many other poljes to a similar cause. The second part of the paper discusses the general hydrographical system of the Kar t, in regar to which again conflicting opinions have been held, some believing in the existence of regular underground rivers, while others, like Grund, have imagined that there is merely a general percolation of ground-water. Dr. Dane believes that both forms exist, and that a cycle of development may perhaps be traceable, the underground rivers marking a more mature stage than the percolating ground-water. Their development will, of course, be favoured by the passage of ordinary streams from an area of impermeable to one of permeable strata. ASIA. Further News of Dr. Sven Hedin reached this country during March. It seems that before meeting with the first Tibetans at the I3ogchang Tsanpo the expedition suffered great privations, not having seen the sign of a human being for 83 days, while of a total of 122 baggage animals only 9 were left when the caravan reached Ngangtse-t o (as the Ngangon-tso seems to be called in the later accounts). The traveller was very favourably received by the Tibetan officials. He reached Shigatse before February 22, having crossed the belt of very elevated plateau, hitherto untraversed, whi h intervenes b tween the Ngan,, e-tso and the upper Brahmaputra. The watershe i here further north than has een supposed, some bi rivers flowing south to the T anpo. The country consists of a complicated labyrinth of ranges and ramifications of rivers. From Stanagho to the neighbourhood of Shigatse Dr. Hedin travelled by boat, and there was a constant stream of boats with pilgrims on their way to attend the New Year festivals at Teshi Lumbo. Here the explorer met with a hearty welcome from the Teshi lama, who made a great impression on him. From Shiv,atse he was about to set out on a further journey of exploration towards the north- vest. The Pang-gong Lake.-A strikin description of the physical phenomena of the Pai g.gong lake and its surroundings is given in the Journal of Geology (vol. 14, No. 7, 1906) by Prof. Ellsworth Hunti gton, who spent a short time (May 1 to May 6, 1905) near the lake when setting out with Mr. Barrett on his latest journey to Central Asia. The writer witnessed the break-up of the ice, with which the lake was covered on his first arrival. As the result of a violent wind from the north-west during the night of May 2, the ice entirely disappeared from the centre of the lake for a distance of S or 10 miles, part being piled up on the shore in a ridge S to 10 feet high. Prof. Huntington watched a sheet of ice in the act of coming ashore, whi h it did with a steady motion at the rate of 3 feet per minute, pushin,, up the sandy beach into a ridge. By testing the degree of saltness in the water after, as compared with before, the disappearance of the ice, he came to the conclusion that a lar,e part of the ice had been melted by the salter warmer water which had displaced the surface film of fresh cold water. Prof. Huntington's remarks on the mode of origin of the I ke are of special interest, as he believes it to occupy a rock-basin hollowed out by glacial action. As is well known, the lake extends to a reat length, occupying, with others of the same series, valley among the mountains which must have once drained wards the Indus. Early observer uch as Drew (in 'The Jummoo and Kashmir Territories '), had ascribed its formation to the damming of the original drainage by fans from tributary torrent Prof. Huntington holds that the streams which formed these fans were quite</page><page sequence="3">THE MONTHLY RECORD. 457 incapable of obstructing the main stream of the valley, which must have had a considerable volume, and that the fans owed the possibility of their formation to the previous holding up of the drainage. He shows that between the lake and the present divide the valley floor consists almost entirely cf solid rock, and that only the (extremely improbable) existence of a gorge, masked by a narrow belt of gravel and lacustrine deposits, could vitiate the conclusion that the basin is terminated by a rock-lip, rising well above the lake-level. The glacial origin is, he says, supported by the abundant evidences of glacial action in the vicinity. The paper treats in some detail of the fluctuations of the lake-level in subsequent periods, as evidenced by lacustrine deposits and shore.lines, which, with numerous old moraines, indicate two extremes of moisture, or at least of lake and glacier expansion, intervening between extremes of aridity or of lake and glacier contraction. The process of desiccation seems to have been oscillatory, and as such oscillations seem to have affected vast areas, they demand the closest study. Obrucheff's latest Expedition to Central Asia-In the summer of 1906 this traveller returned to the region of the Tarbagatai, to complete the researches begun during the previous year (Journal, vol. 28, p. 180). A short account of the results appears in the first number of Petermanns Mitteilungen for 1907. The region examined lay on the borders of Chinese Dzungaria, and its physical geography and geology had been previously almost unknown. It includes the ranges known as Kojur, Urkashar, Semistai, and Jair, with the adjacent valleys. The former all consist of "horsts," with more or less even surfaces covered with alpine meadows, and of the peneplain type. On certain sides they fall very steeply, and their borders are broken by impassable ravines. The horsts themselves are all composed of Devonian and Carboniferous formations, chiefly clay, quartz, and siliceous slates, but including some sandstones and limestones. On their margins there are intrusive masses of porphyry, melaphyr, etc., while the foothills consist of sand- stones, conglomerates,' etc., of Mesozoic age. Some traces of former glaciation were seen, and many observations of subairial denudation, the formation of bess, and the like, were made. AFRICA. Scientific Research in German East Africa-During 1906 two expeditions were sent out to East Africa under the auspices of the "Commission for the geographical investigation of the German Protectorates." The one, under Dr. Fritz Jaeger, was commissioned to carry out geographical researches in the northern part of the territory; the other, under Dr. Karl Weule, had for its main object ethno- graphical studies in the more southern portion. Information regarding the work accomplished by both expeditions is given in the Mitteilungen aus den Deutsclien Scliutzgebieten, vol. 19, pt. iv. One section of Dr. Jaeger's journey was referred to in the February number (p. 226, ante). After returning from his visit to the Kiniarok steppe, the traveller, with his companion Herr Oehler, of Frankfurt, an experienced alpinist, set out from Moshi for the Kibo peak of Kilimanjaro on August 10, 1906, with the intention of investigating the western glaciers. This was done from a base.camp at a height of a little over 14,000 feet, special attention being devoted to the Penck glacier. Following on a period of copious rainfall, the snow was found to reach down to 15,750 feet, and Dr. Jaeger was able to study the early stages in the production of "nieves penitentes" during the process of melting (cf. Journal, vol. 25, p. 213; vol. 26, p. 91). He found that the primary ridges on the firn surface ran in one constant direction, viz, west-north-west, with no relation to the direction of slope, though this latter determined the breaking up of the ridges into individual "penitentes," apparently under the action of water. While</page><page sequence="4">458 THE MONTHLY RECORD. agreeing that the formation of the ridges is due to solar radiation, he is unable to suggest any better explanation than the more or less unsatisfactory ones already put forward. The effects of ice-avalanches on the surface of the snow were also noticed. With a view to future measurement of the rate of flow of the Penck glacier, the travellers marked with red paint a series of rocks stretching across it between points marked on either side. They subsequently made their way to Lake Victoria by way of Umbugwe and Iraku, climbing the Gurui volcano en route. They were about to extend their work over the region of inland drainage to the north.east. Owing to disturbances in the Kondoa-Irangi region, Dr. Weule thought it best to change his plans, and carried out some important investigations among the tribes of the extreme south of German territory, north of the Rovuma. He returned to the coast in November last. The Nigeria-Kamerun Boundary. -The accompanying sketch-map shows the course of the boundary between Nigeria and the Kamerun, as Pnally fixed by the agreement of 1906 (see Journal, vol. 28, p. 509). That agreement had to (10 with the northern section of the line, from the neighbourhood of Yola to Lake Chad, no important change having been made in the southern half since it was fixed by the agreement of November 14, 1893. Proposed Railway from Beira to the Zambezi.-A scheme has been set on foot for a railway to connect the port of Beira with the Zambezi at some point above the portion of the lower river which is so obstructed by shifting sandbanks that navigation is a matter of difficulty. We learn from South Africa of February 16 last that a survey of the proposed route is now being made by Belgian engineers. The length of the line would be about 250 kilometres (150 miles), and the terminus suggested is at Lacerdonia, near the confluence of the Shire with the Zambezi, the permanence of the river-bank at this spot being a point in its favour. Recent Exploration of the Kamolondo-The Kamolondo, the 100-mile section of the western main branch of the upper Congo from the Kondd rapids (90 10' 5) to about Hell Gate (50 20' 5.), was first traced in 1896 by Captain Brasseur. A second and more technical survey was made by Lieut. Lattes, between April and August, 1903. A third survey, just concluded by Lieut. Mauritz, is reported in the Jliliouvement Gdographique (1907, No. 7). In accord with Lattes, he finds that the 250 miles of the Kamolondo from Lake Kissale to Hell Gate, with mean breadth of 1600 feet, flows with a deep and regular current between well-marked banks, offering an easily navigable channel. From Lake Kissale, on the other hand, to the Kondd rapids, a stretch of 150 miles, the river winds through a broad low plain, which it inundates by its annual rise. In this region a series of permanent lakes (relics of the former Kamolondo lake), with ill-defined shores, and varying with the river's level, border the principal channel. Here the channel calls for some engineering in order to its utilization. Another Lake No, the Kissale grows papyrus and other aquatic plants obstructive to thorough fare. These will have to be lastingly cleared out. Ilere, therefore, will have to be undertaken a work similar to that accomplished in effecting a passage through the sudd of the Nile. On the conclusion of that undertaking, the Kamolondo will be opened to steam navigation across the lake. The Comoro Islands-The Zeitschrift of the Berlin Geographical Society (No. 9, 1906) contains an interesting general account of the Comoro islands by A. Yoeltzkow. All the islands are volcanic, rising steeply from the sea. In the last century there was volcanic activity on Great Comoro, and but a few years ago destruc- tive eruptions occurred. Great Comoro was till recently little known in a scientific sense. In 1863 Dr. Kersten made the first ascent of its high volcano. In 1884</page><page sequence="5">10 12 14 L.CffAD 12 _____________________ Diki 12 Gifba 0 ZR T II E 1&lt; N Js Q Gnd, ? 17b AUCBI zy 3fruiv 10 ----- _____________ __ 10 LB N I ZR I dMndo YOLA Lame0 La1iabe, bere 8 Riiinu Kateeua - - -' - / Belwin. -' 6 ________________ oBagani ILNIGERIA - RAMERUN 00krwi BOUNDARY 1906 K Scale 1:5,500,000 otihich- 87 Stat.TMik 50 0 50 100 I -, 10 12 4</page><page sequence="6">460 THE MONTHLY RECORD. M. Humblot, collector and scientific explorer in Madagascar, was charged by the French Government to make an examination of the island. His mission led to the formation of the "Socidtd de In Grande Comore"for the economic exploration of the island. There was still, however, an ample field for Herr Yoeltzkow's scientific exploration. Great Comoro is the largest and highest of the four islands. Whereas Anjuan rises to 5000 feet and Moheli to 2000, Great Comoro reaches 8000 feet. It is 38 miles long by 11 miles in average breadth, and contains two elevated regions. In the south is the mountain mass of Karthala, filling up nearly the whole centre, and with a still active volcano, rising uniformly like a huge dome out of the sea, with flat summit, to 8000 feet. In clear weather the volcano is visible over 100 miles. In the north the ground rises gradually from the coast to an irregulafplateau of over 2000 feet, above which numerous bare, regularly shaped cones, with truncated craters, rise to about 4000 feet. These two elevations, north and south, are separated by a depression with an average height of about 1600 feet, forming an enormous desert field of younger lava-streams, intersected by paths communicating between the east and west. The coast region of the Karthala massf up to 2000 feet is the cultivated zone, occupied by coconut palms, banana groves, mangoes, plantations of vanilla, cacao, coffee, etc. Above, up to 6000 feet, is the great moist primitive forest. The summit is covered with high grass and low bush, presenting steppe-like meadows. The climate is tempered by the insular situation and the prevailing winds. The north- east rain-bringing monsoon begins at the end of October, and is often squally. The south-west monsoon is steady, and yields occa- sional showers; but November to March is the rainy season proper. On the upper slopes of the hi,,h volcano there is continuous rain on the weather side. Particu- larly interesting are Dr. Voeltzkov's remarks on the history of the s&amp;tlement and the anthropology of the islands. Migrations in the Ogowe Basin.-The importance of the study of the migrations of primitive peoples cannot be overestimated, and Lieut. Avelot has done great service, particularly to anthropologists, in publishin, in the Bulletin de G&amp;graphie Ilistorique et Descr/ptive (vol. 20, p. 357), a careful account of the movements of the peoples dwelling in the basin of the Ogowe and the adjacent country. From the records of old travellers, from native traditions and from personal observations, M. Avelot has reconstructed the past history of these tribes-the most important of which are the Bakalai, Fiottes, and Pahouins or Fans-and has been able to trace their movements for several generations. The value of the paper is greatly increased by a series of excellent maps, showing the positions of the tribes at different periods, and by two sets of tables-one an attempt at a classification of the peoples in the Ogo\ e basin, and the other a short comparative vocabulary of thirty-five dialects spoken in the French Congo, and of eleven other African tongues. The paper is one of the most important and useful that has appeared for some time, and it is to be hoped that M. Avelot will be able to carry out similar investigations among other peoples. ote on Ruwenzori: Erratuxn.-In the March Journal, p. 329, line 1, for "Mount Baker" read "Mount Speke" AMERICA. The Malaspina Glacier-In Science of January 4, 1907, Prof. R. S. Tarr calls attention to the remarkable chan es which had taken place in some of the glaciers which debonch on the great Malaspina ice-field dunn,, the ten months which elapsed between his visits of 1905 and 1906. In the former year the surface of these glaciers offered no greater obstacles to easy travel than they had at</page><page sequence="7">THE MONTHLY RECORD. 461 the time of the expeditions of Hussell, Bryant, and others to Mount St. Elias, while in the latter they were so crevassed, owing to a rapid forward movement of the ice, as to be almost impassable. A striking contrast, however, was afforded by others of the glaciers, which showed practically no change during the same interval. Similar phenomena were displayed by the glaciers entering Yakutat bay, some of which showed a marked advance, while others had remained stationary. The writer thinks that these facts are not to be accounted for by ordinary climatic variations, but suggests that the severe earthquake shocks which visited this region in 1899, and which caused a sudden uplift of the coast-line in Yakutat bay (see Journal, vol. 28, p. 30), or possibly some previous earthquake, may have shaken down unusual quantities of snow and ice from the mountains near the head of some of the glaciers, thus starting a wave of advance. The suggestion is certainly ingenious, though even if earthquake shocks may have been the cause of the advance, the method of action referred to does not seem to be the only one capable of producing the given effect. Might not these have resulted, e.g., from an alteration of the slope of the ground beneath the ice, possibly at the time of the disturbances of 1906? Anyhow, as Prof. Tarr says, it will be a matter of great interest to carefully xvatch the behaviour of all these glaciers during the next few years. The New Salton Sea.-The recent formation of a lake of considerable area in the Salton depression, owing to the irruption of water from the Colorado river through irrigation channels, has already been referred to in the Journal (vol. 27, p. 631), and vas also discussed by Major Beacom in the paper on irrigation lately read before the Society. From a paper by Mr. C. A. Byers in the January number of the Popular Science Monthly of New York, it seems that the control of the overflow from the Colorado is a matter of much greater difficulty than has been supposed. Mr. Byers discusses the possibilities of a permanent alteration in the geography of this region, and points out that any advantages which might be supposed to accrue from the existence of an inland sea in the arid tract north of the Gulf of California could hardly outweigh the loss of so large an area of irrigable land. Owing to the damage caused to the Southern Pacific Ilailroad by the irrup- tion of the Colorado, the work of controlling the river was taken in hand by the company, and the various attempts to secure the mastery, each more determined than its predecessor, are described in the paper referred to. After six failures, a seventh attempt, involvin,, an outlay of $10,000, was commenced early in 1906, and seemed for a time likely to be successful. But a postscript to the paper records the fact that on December 7 last the river once more broke through, the conditions becoming as bad as six months previously, and the possibilities of a permanent Salton sea more pronounced than ever. The recent break occurred just below the new dyke, which had a length of over 10 miles, and has already excavated a cai'ion- like channel in the easily eroded material of the river-bank. To ensure success, about 20 more miles of dyke would be needed, and this, too, would have to be built without delay. The article is illustrated by photographs of the various channels and controlling works. It may be mentioned that a somewhat abnormal amount of rainfall in the extreme west of the United States has been attributed by popular imagination to the Salton inundation, but it need hardly be said that such ideas can have little scientific basis. Expeditions to the Pilcomayo.-The German engineer,W. Herrmann, last year undertook an expedition for the examination of the middle course of the Pilcomayo, which, though the goal of many explorin,, expeditions, has hitherto been imper- fectly known. According to a communication from the traveller printed in the Zeitschr4ft of the Berlin Geographical Society (t906, No. 10) this object was successfully accomplished, the course of the river being followed from 220 to 240 5.,</page><page sequence="8">462 THE MONTHLY RECORD. though, on arriving at about the latter parallel, it was found impossible to continue the journey owing to the splitting up of the river into many shallow channels, and the swampy nature of the flat country on either side. The greater part of the descent was accomplished in a "chalana" or covered boat, 20 feet long. The river, between the parallels mentioned, consists of a single channel only, without rapids, and navigable for small vessels. The banks were at first 30 to 40 feet above the water, but became gradually lower, being in places only 3 feet high. The river was exceptionally low at the time. The whole middle and lower course of the Pilcomayo, from 22 S. to its mouth, has also been surveyed within the last two years by a party from the side of the Argentine under Mr. G. Lange, but the German traveller does not seem to have met the latter. An account of Mr. Lange's expedition, with a map of the river in seven sheets, on the scale of 1: 100,000, has quite lately appeared in Buenos Aires - The Distribution of Earthquakes in Chile.-The well-known Italian seismologist, Dr. M. Baratta, brings together the historical data bearing on this question in the January number of the Bolietino of the italian Geographical Society, giving, besides, a map showing the general di,tribution of the earthquakes. While no general conclusions are presented by the writer, the facts adduced show how all the great earthquakes in this much-disturbed region have tended to be concentrated within definite areas, the zones of greatest seismic activity lying at intervals along the coast-line, from the Peruvian frontier in the north to Yaldivia in the south. For frequency of destructive earthquakes, the portion of the coast from Caldera and Copiapo in the north to Coquimbo in the south seems to be particularly prominent, while the tract with Yalparaiso as centre stands out for the violence of the destructive agencies. As a rule, Valparaiso has lain within the zone of greatest destruction, while Santiago has suffered less, though the case is occasionally reversed. Chile also feels the influence of the unstable zone of Mendoza in the Argentina, but the destructive effects are in this case extremely limited. It may perhaps be questioned how far the spaces between the zone laid down are really less subject to seismic disturbance, and whether their apparent freedom may be due in part to the paucity of centres of population where the destructive effects would be seen. POLAR REGIONS. The Prince of Monaco's Expedition to Spitsbergen.-We have received the following communication from Captain G. Isachsen: "I have delayed answer- ing your letter of September 29, 1906, until H.S.H. the Prince of Monaco, who fitted out the expedition, had presented his 'Campagne Scientifique'to the Academy of Science in Paris. I now send you a note stating briefly what ,,round we have covered. I am now working out a map of the region explored-one-half on the scale of 1 100,000, the other half 1 : 50,000. The expedition consisted of seven men under my command. (1) Between July 14 and 19 the preliminary topo- graphical work was carried out at Cross bay. (2) Between July 20 and August 15 the traverse of New Spitsbergen was effected by two parties-the one coming down at the mouth of Cross bay, the other at Muller bay. Afterwards one of the parties traversed another line from Magdalena bay to Lilliehook bay. (3) August 15 to August 30 smaller trips in the interior completed the work. We found the most part of the interior of New Spitsbergen covered with ice; a large ice-plateau south of Liefde bay drains to this bay, but mostly to Kings bay. The height of this plateau was from 800-1000 metres above the sea.

Mr. Mikkelsen's Expedition.-Mr. Mikkelsen has sent us a statement of the position and prospects of his expedition at the end of last September, together with a discussion of the evidence which seems to point to the existence of land not far from the north coast of Alaska. The passage of Point Barrow (Journal, vol. 28, p. 403) was only effected through the aid courteously rendered by Captain Cottle of the steam-whaler Beluedere, who took the Duchess of Bedford in tow. Other- wise it would hardly have been possible for a sailing vessel such as Mr. Mikkelsen's</page><page sequence="10">464 THE MONTHLY RECORD. to pass the point in the teeth of an adverse wind and strong current. Winter quarters were finally selected at Flaxman island, after vain attempts to push further east, and Mr. Mikkelsen thought that this spot would prove an advantageous base for the exploration of the Beaufort sea by sledge-journeys during the spring. From his own observations, and from careful inquiries among the whalers, his belief in the existence of land to the north has been much strengthened. He has convinced himself of the heavy nature of the ice of the Beaufort sea, and of its general near- ness to the land. At Point Barrow it does leave the coast in normal years, but further east, towards Cross island, it seems to be almost permanent, though still further in the same direction, off Herschel island, there is nearly always open water quite early in the year. After alluding to the land reported by Captain Keenan, who is said by the whalers to have been a thoroughly reliable man, and to Eskimo legends pointing in the same direction, Mr. Mikkelsen lays stress on the exist- ence, year after year, of a great crack in the ice, which is used by the whales in their annual migration to north- east towards the end of May, between which date and July they are never seen on the coast. Migratory birds also pass annually in the same direction, evidently to some unknown breeding-ground. By a trip over the ice north of the winter quarters during the present spring, and another in 1908 from Cape Prince Alfred on Banks Land, Mr. Mikkelsen hopes to set at rest the question of the existence of land in this locality. Dr. Charcot's New Expedition.-We have received from Dr. Charcot a brief statement of his plans for a new expedition to the Antarctic for the purpose of continuing his researches in the Graham Land region. At the explorer's request, a committee was lately appointed by the Academy of Sciences to consider the question, and as a result of its favourable report the Academy, on February 4, decided to support his proposals for a second French Antarctic expedition. The following is an outline of the provisional programme. A vessel will be specially built for the purposes of the expedition, possibly at Dr. Charcot's own expense. The explorer and his companions would proceed in the spring to the site of the rich deposits of fossils discovered by the Swedish expedition at Mount Bransfield and Seymour island, and, having either returned to Ushuaia with the collections or left them at an accessible spot in the region to the south, would, from Wandel island as a base, extend the explorations carried out during the first expedition to the unknown region south of Loubet land. The expedition would winter at a suitable spot, making journeys along the coasts and into the interior, with a view both to scientific observations and a general reconnaissance of the region to the south. During the following summer the voyage would be resumed according as circumstances dictated. Scientific work of all kinds would be kept up throughout the course of the expedition. Dr. Charcot calculates the probable expense, including the cost of the ship, at not over ?30,000. GENERAL. Masudi on Volcanoes.-An article in the Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society (vol. 22, No. 61) brings together the statements respecting volcanoes made by the Arab historian Masudi (tenth century A.D.). As the histoi-ian travelled as far as the Malay peninsula and the Chinese seas, his views, embodied in 'Meadows of Gold and Mines of Jewels,' may be taken to be based on personal observation. He speaks of volcanoes in the most distant islands in the Sea of China, which the author of the article takes to be those of Java and Sumatra. In dealing, too, with the volcanic belts of the Caucasus (long extinct) and of Sicily, Masudi refers to the volcanoes in the kingdom of the Maharajah, which may be identified as those of Java and Sumatra, then under a Maharajah, and to the volcano</page><page sequence="11">OBITUARY. 465 A "Zabej" (Java?) in the Sea of China. The volcano of Sicily is called "Jabal al Barkan." He also speaks of the volcano of "Wadi Berhont in Hadramaut," and of that of "Esk (Eskibun) in the country of Fars," and of the hot springs of sulphur and vitriol in the province of Sirwan. So much for Masudi's geographical field. His vulcanology is still anthropomorphic. From volcanoes "emanates a frightful voice announcing the death of a kin, or chief." He also speaks of "the sound of drums, flutes, lutes," etc. A volcano is also a "hill," or seat, of punishment for the wicked. OBITUARY. Dr. Alfred Kirchhoff. Dis. ALFRED KIRCRHOFF, one of the best known and most stwcessful workers in the cause of eographical education in Germany, died on February 8, 1907, at the age of sixty-nine years. Towards the end of 1904 he had been forced, by failing eye- sight, to resign the professorship at Halle University, which he had held for thirty- one years, and his powers had since gradually declined, the end being, perhaps, hastened by the results of a fall in the autumn of last year. Kitchhoff will be remembered, side by side with llatzel and Richthofen, as one of the band of successful teachers to whom the present satisfactory position of geography in Germany has been mainly due. During his whole career as professor his stimulating influence had been felt by a constant succession of pupils, who have themselves become centres for the propagation of his ideals and methods in many diterent parts of Germany; and the universal regard and affection which they have constantly testified towards him supply one of the best testimonials to the impor- tance of his work. His competence as a geographer was due in great measure to the many-sided character of his interests, which well qualified him to deal with a subject which forms, like ,eography, a link between the sciences of nature and man. Born at Erfurt in 1838, he completed his education at the universities of Jena and Bonn, where he paid attention alike to natural science, history, philology, and other subjects. For some years he worked as a teacher in various schools, and the experience so gained no doubt did much to qualify him in later years to deal with the needs of geographical education in all grades. Among his most important services to this cause were the various educational works which came from his pen, especially the 'School Geography,' which first appeared in 1882; while his con- tributions to a clearer understanding of the scope and possibilities of the subject as an educational instrument were no less valuable. It was to the regional side of geography-the presentation of a complete picture of a given country under all its aspects-that he attached especial importance, as was evidenced by his zealous furthering of regional studies in Germany, which hd its outcome in the excellent work of the "Centralkommission fur wissenschaftliche Landeskunde von Deutschland For twenty years Kirchhoff edited the well-known collection of monographs, brought out under the auspices of this body, with the title 'Forsehungen zur deutschen Landes- und Volkskunde.' He was also responsible, with others, for the periodical reports on the literature of German geography. A work of wider scope was the series of monographs on the geography of Europe, written by various experts under his general editorship, and originally planned, under the title, 'Unser Wissen von der Erde,' to form part of a descriptive geography of the whole world. Among Kirchhoff's shorter writings were various papers on the geographical and political relations of mankind, which bore witness to great insight and breadth of view. Among these were a study entitled 'Das Meer im Leben der V3lker' No. 1Y.-APBIL, 1907j</page></plain_text>
