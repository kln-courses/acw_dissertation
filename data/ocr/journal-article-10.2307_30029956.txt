<plain_text><page sequence="1">"LEVIATHAN IS A SKEIN OF NETWORKS": TRANSLATIONS OF NATURE AND CULTURE IN MOBY-DICK BY PHILIP ARMSTRONG I. Moby-Dick emerges at a point of crucial historical transition in several areas of American life. By the mid-nineteenth century, the growth and global expansion of the nation's economy following the War of 1812, and the pugnacious expansionism exemplified by the Mexican War and the ideology of manifest destiny, were giving way to signs of strain and impending civil discord: 1850 and 1851, the years during which Melville wrote his novel, were the years of the doomed compromise between opponents and proponents of slavery. The oceans provided a space in which these contending currents met and mingled.' Echoing contemporary politicians and apologists, Moby-Dick's narrator rhapsodizes about the contributions made to America's economy and the dissemination of its influence by the vast whaling fleet which, at the apogee of the industry, spanned the planet." The tensions aboard the Pequod, condensed into the malig- nant figure of the White Whale, therefore embody contemporary strains and threats produced by industrialization, at both the natural and the cultural levels. Cesare Casarino has enumerated the vicissi- tudes of globalizing industry that were enacted on the "factory floor" of the whaleship: an epochal shift from mercantile to industrial capitalism, an ensuing redefinition of the relationship between labor and capital, and the unpredictable effects of intimate and extended interaction amongst a radically "international, multiethnic, multilin- gual and especially multiracial labor force."" Moreover, the cata- strophic fate of the Pequod, suggesting the transience and fragility of these economic and social transactions, uncannily anticipated the collapse of the sperm whale fishery as well. For the middle of the century was also a turning point for whaling: during these years "Californian fever" began to take labor away from the centers of the ELH 71 (2004) 1039-1063 a 2004 by The Johns Hopkins University Press 1039</page><page sequence="2">industry, which were further undermined by the financial crisis of 1857 and the concurrent flight of investment capital; the obsoles- cence of spermaceti and whale oil was assured by a cleaner, cheaper and more easily accessible alternative once petroleum began to flow from Pennsylvanian oil wells in 1859; and the Civil War, during which whaling vessels proved easy targets, completed the decline. Mean- while it became increasingly hard to deny, in the second half of the century, that overexploitation of cetacean species had made voyages longer, more expensive, and less remunerative-and thus, in the end, financially nonviable.4 That the animal, dead or alive, should figure at the center of these historical and economic shifts is no surprise. Over its two-hundred- year history, industrialization has produced, among its other effects- urbanization, degradation of the economic status of women, redefini- tion of labor structures, environmental depredation-a radically altered relationship between humans and other animals. Industrial techniques have absolved farmers from close proximity to their livestock; assembly-line specialization of tasks has alienated slaugh- terhouse workers from the living creature being processed; geo- graphical and psychological gaps have widened between an increas- ingly urbanized human populace and other species.5 Meanwhile, natural history and social science alike have dedicated themselves to modernity's long project of rewriting authoritative perceptions about relationships between human societies and nature; in the mid- nineteenth century this entailed a transition from Christian to evolutionary notions of the "chain of being," which simultaneously broke down received divisions between the human and the animal, and installed new ones.6 The whaleman stood with one foot on either side of these many faultlines. He was praised as a harbinger of American values and vilified for his immoral relationship with the "innocent savages" of the Pacific.7 He was both a romantic adventurer into wild space and a prototype of the industrial laborer, farmer, and meat processor. His experience routinely alternated between dangerous encounters with the vast materiality of the living animal and its reduction to dead and partial resources, a commodity to be measured by the barrel, reified by the factory ship's technological procedures and its specialization of labor.8 No wonder that Moby-Dick, like its sources, oscillates so vigorously between apparently opposed attitudes to the whale: won- der and contempt, mundane nonchalance and transcendent awe, humanized fellow feeling and the calculus of market value and profit. 1040 Translations of Nature and Culture in Moby-Dick</page><page sequence="3">In what follows, I will argue that "leviathan," as understood by Melville and his contemporaries, also crosses back and forth between the human and the nonhuman domains in ways that demonstrate the inextricable interimplication of these apparently discrete and op- posed dimensions. In We Have Never Been Modern, Bruno Latour argues that such mediations between society and nature functioned as "the unthinkable, the unconscious" upon which depended the very establishment of "the modern constitution"-that is, the ideology of progressivist humanism that emerged in the European Enlighten- ment and was operating at full strength by the time Melville began his novel.9 Latour suggests that seventeenth-century political and scientific theory inaugurated a false dichotomy between the realms of nature and society, assigning humans and nonhumans to separate ontological planes, upon which were predicated the most authorita- tive epistemologies of modernity: liberal democracy, capitalism, and scientific empiricism. To understand modernity, and in particular its insistent compartmentalization of knowledge, Latour invites analysis of what he calls "translation": the continuous process of exchange between nonhuman and human domains, recognition of which is foreclosed by the "modern constitution."'0 Melville's whales, I will argue, evince precisely this kind of transgressive translation. At certain moments they act as screens for the projection of models for human society; at others they are called upon to shape that society, or are shaped by it. Hence, although Latour's comment that "leviathan is a skein of networks" actually refers to the famous Hobbesian allegory of civil collectivity, my title applies it to the whales represented in Melville's novel, because I think Moby-Dick represents the transfer point between modernity's constructions of human society and its perception of actual nine- teenth-century cetaceans. " In what follows, I seek to pursue some of the networks-in particular those of racial and gender ideology-that entrap, or stitch together, the biological and cultural body of America's industrialized leviathan.l" II. The modern constitution, as Latour puts it, "explained everything, but only by leaving out what was in the middle"-that is to say, "hybrids, monsters -what Donna Haraway calls 'cyborgs' and 'trick- sters' ... whose explanation it abandons."'" Haraway's cyborg is a constructed entity that occupies more than one of the ontological Philip Armstrong 1041</page><page sequence="4">realms into which modernity sought to divide the real. Moby-Dick's Captain Ahab, for example, simultaneously inhabits the human, technological, and animal domains. He fuses his own body with the factory ship he commands, fitting his prosthetic leg into an auger hole in the deck, envisaging his relation to the crew in mechanical terms- my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels, and they revolve" (M, 143)-and fantasizing about the construction of a mechanical automaton completely obedient to his will (M, 359). In these ways, as critics have argued, Ahab embodies contemporary "American hopes that technology would empower free men," and his quest becomes an allegory of that attempt to master nature which characterized industrial capitalism in its new found confidence.'4 At the same time, and more problematically, Ahab's body also relies upon its incorporation of the animal he hunts: his "ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whale's jaw" (M, 109). In this way the captain's physical form again becomes interchangeable with that of his ship, insofar as the Pequod too is partly constructed from the bones of the animal it pursues and processes. Psychoanalytically inclined critics like David Mitchell argue that "disability ... continually surfaces as an answer to Ahab's fathomless personality," citing as evidence the emergence of his madness during a stormy voyage around Cape Horn after the amputation of his leg during his first encounter with Moby Dick: "[T]hen it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another, and so interfusing made him mad" (M, 156).15 But the rhetoric here suggests that Ahab's madness derives not from sever- ance but from commingling, not from lack but from augmentation. Rather than the loss of a limb-as Ahab later tells the ship's carpenter, he still feels the phantom leg (M, 360)-the prosthetic represents its supplementation. The wound is a site of conjuncture- an "interfusing [that] made him mad"-wherein man and whale are grafted together, bone to bone, leg to jaw. Ahab's madness arises at the point of mediation between animal and human: the incommensu- rable contradiction produced by the human's material dependence on the body of the animal, combined with the simultaneous exclusion of the animal from the cultural definition of what it is to be a human. In all these ways, the two poles of the natural and social, or of the nonhuman and the human, are brought into communication. If the human becomes a machinic and beastly cyborg in Moby- Dick, the animal also incorporates human and cultural dimensions. Melville's whales demonstrate other kinds of "translation" between 1042 Translations of Nature and Culture in Moby-Dick</page><page sequence="5">the supposedly distinct domains of nature and society. Elizabeth Schultz has described a pattern of cyborg imagery in the novel that simultaneously compares whales to natural forms and to human technological inventions. .. . Right whales, for example, are com- pared to great boulders and their eating to scything."'6 Such meta- phorical transgressions of the dualism between the realms of human enterprise and animal activity were by no means uncommon in mid- nineteenth-century scientific writing, although they did not always serve the ideology of environmental care that twentieth-century ecocritics such as Schultz tend to project onto the novel. Just as Moby-Dick frequently uses mechanistic imagery to describe na- ture-for example, comparing the whale's regularity of locomotion with reference to "the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway" (M, 414)-Jeremiah Reynolds, one of the most energetic contempo- rary apologists for the whaling industry, whose account of "Mocha Dick, Or the White Whale of the Pacific" was a major influence on the novel, compares the breathing of his famous leviathan with the action of a steam engine."7 The comparison works in reverse when Reynolds describes a ship's tryworks in full operation. Melville's account of this process portrays it as the most infernal of industrial activities.'" Reynolds, however, employs terms typical of the Romantic evocation of the natural sublime: [T]here are few objects in themselves more picturesque or beautiful, than a whaleship, seen from a distance of three or four miles, on a pleasant evening, in the midst of the great Pacific. As she moves gracefully over the water, rising and falling on the gentle undulations peculiar to this sea; her sails glowing in the quivering light of the fires that flash from below, and a thick volume of smoke ascending from her midst, and curling away in dark masses upon the wind; it requires little effort of the fancy, to imagine one's self gazing upon a floating volcano. 1 Here, the Romantic association between natural sublimity and hu- man sensibility is energetically read in reverse, since for Reynolds capitalist technology at work displays a beauty equal to the most awe- inspiring efforts of nature. Moreover this lyricism is evoked in the service of the very process, that of globalizing industry, against which literary Romanticism defined itself in the first place. Clearly Moby-Dick emerges from a context in which, due to the volatility of contending economic and cultural ideologies, the bound- Philip Armstrong 1043</page><page sequence="6">ary between human and nonhuman evinced greater permeability than would subsequently be admitted. Indeed, Melville's novel bears witness to forms of mediation-or, in Latour's term, translation-that prove considerably more radical than those identified so far, which remain at the level of rhetoric and representation. With greater or lesser degrees of consciousness, Moby-Dick registers, I think, several crucial ways in which the natural world and mid-nineteenth-century American social organization proved mutually constitutive. That is to say, the novel shows society making nature, and vice versa, both materially and representationally. III. At the time Melville was writing, a proliferation of stories about fighting whales betrayed the anxiety of globalizing industrial capital- ism towards the animal nature upon which it depended, but which sometimes resisted or escaped its control.20 The notorious sinking of the Essex in 1820 was the first documented case of a whale success- fully attacking not a mere whaleboat but a full-sized ship."2' Nathaniel Philbrick outlines other such well known incidents during the de- cades prior to Moby-Dick: In 1835 the crew of the English whaleship Pusie Hall were forced into full retreat by what they termed a "fighting whale." ... In 1836, the Lydia, a Nantucket whaleship, was struck and sunk by a sperm whale, as was the Two Generals a few years later. In 1850, the Pocahontas, out of Martha's Vineyard, was rammed by a whale but was able to reach port for repairs. Then, in 1851, the year that Moby- Dick was published, a whaleship was attacked by a sperm whale in the same waters where the Essex had been sunk thirty-one years before." The final reference here is to the sinking of the Ann Alexander, a New Bedford whaler commanded by Captain John DeBlois, who described the offending whale as an "artful beast" and a "crafty monster," attributing to it a high degree of intentional agency, expressed in humanized terms: "turning on his side, he looked at us, apparently filled with rage.""3 To what should this profusion of effective attacks by animals upon human industry-or at least, this proliferation in accounts of such attacks-be attributed? Philbrick offers the following explanation by Charles Wilkes, commander of the United States Exploring Expedi- 1044 Translations of Nature and Culture in Moby-Dick</page><page sequence="7">tion of 1838-1842, which undertook a global survey of marine life, ocean currents, whale distribution, and the activities of the whaling industry: An opinion has indeed gained ground within a few years that the whales are diminishing in numbers; but this surmise, as far as I have learned from the numerous inquiries, does not appear to be well founded. They have indeed become wilder, or as some of the whalers express it, "more scary," and in consequence, not so easy to capture; but if we consider the numbers that continue to be yearly taken, there will, I think, be no reason to suppose that any great decrease has occurred.24 In nineteenth-century usage, "scary" usually meant shyer, more easily scared off-or in the whaleman's language, "gallied." But the same word could also be used, as it is more commonly today, as an adjective describing a cause of fear or alarm. The phrase Wilkes ascribes to the whalers thus occupies both of the poles between which accounts of recalcitrant whales tended to oscillate in contemporary explanations of their behavior: timid and bold, defensive and offensive, instinctually reactive and wilfully aggressive.25 Moreover, Wilkes hints that this increased "wildness"-a term encompassing the same pair of opposed denotations-might actually be a response produced by the whaling industry. If he is correct, the "scary" whale would have to be considered a human construction at the material, rather than just the rhetorical, level. Ecological histo- rian Tim Flannery argues that human use of animals-especially the radical acceleration of extractive exploitation during the nineteenth century-created a wariness and antagonism on the part of certain species towards humans that they would not always have shown. As he puts it, "humans made the savage beast": the "wild" animal, far from being pure nature, must be considered in this sense a product of human social, cultural, and economic forces.26 Hence, even in the moment of their separation-the point at which industrial capitalism widened the division between an urban, technologized domesticity and an uncultivated natural wilderness-the social and natural do- mains are constructing and shaping each other. Melville expands at length upon the inference by Wilkes that cetacean wildness arises from the co-construction of human and natural worlds. Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favor of the gradual extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example that in former Philip Armstrong 1045</page><page sequence="8">years (the latter part of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in small pods, were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in consequence, the voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much more remunerative. Because, as has been elsewhere noted, those whales, influenced by some views to safety, now swim the seas in immense caravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries, yokes, and pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated, unfrequent armies. (M, 353) Arguing against the perception that whale numbers have diminished overall, this passage repeats a striking hypothesis, first advanced in a chapter entitled "The Grand Armada" and reinforced here and elsewhere (M, 305), that the social structure of the sperm whale has fundamentally altered in response to the whaling industry: But here let it be premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm Whales, instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies, as in former times, are now frequently met with in extensive herds, sometimes embracing so great a multitude, that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection. (M, 298) Howard Vincent plausibly attributes Melville's description of pods, schools and bodies of whales to Frederick Bennett, but he does not comment on Melville's addition of the above cited suggestion-which does not occur in the source text-that the social organization of whales had altered in response to human intervention.27 There is no clear origin for this idea anywhere in Melville's written sources, so it may derive from the collective first-hand observations and hypotheses of whalemen themselves, to which Moby-Dick's author gained access during his own experience aboard whalers in the Pacific. The theory may also represent Melville's own extrapola- tion from the more general hints, common enough amongst whaling writers of the time, regarding the increasing wariness or scarcity of whales. Thomas Beale, for example, writing about the Japan fishery after 1819, claimed that whales were no scarcer in number, but simply more "cautious" and full of "instinctive cunning" in avoiding boats.28 And Francis Olmsted, another of Melville's favorites, com- mented that "[t]here are such numbers of whale ships scattered all over the ocean is not wonderful that whales have become shy."29 Nevertheless, Melville's description of "The Grand Armada" goes further than these writers, because it asserts a material influence that 1046 Translations of Nature and Culture in Moby-Dick</page><page sequence="9">interfuses the supposedly separate domains of the natural and the cultural, in such a way that human economic and industrial enterprise shapes the animal's social formation. In this sense, Moby-Dick ascribes to sperm whales (and does so insistently, repeating the notion three times in different chapters) a capacity to learn and to pass on that learning which cannot be reduced to instinct, a form of "behavioral transmission that doesn't rest on genetics"-in other words, a culture.3a Furthermore, Latour's notion of "translation" would demand that this suggestion of a material co-construction be distinguished from a rather more familiar representational borrowing between the animal and human domains. This latter mode, discussed earlier in relation to the metaphorical comparisons by Melville and Reynolds between nature and technology, recurs when Ishmael describes various whale conglomerations in terms deriving from human society and politics, as in the title of the chapter "The Grand Armada," or in his comment that the new formations appear "as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant." Such conceits were actually typical of emergent modern natural history, which despite its incep- tion as a crucial epistemological component of the separation be- tween nature and human society, retained this symptom of an interimplication of the two domains.3l Keith Thomas notes, for example, that the Linnaean system, "as propounded in late-eigh- teenth-century England," divided what it called the "Vegetable Kingdom" into "tribes" and "nations," allocating obviously sociologi- cal characteristics to its subdivisions within the latter class: grasses were described as "plebeians," lilies as "patricians," mosses as "servants," flags as "slaves" and so on.32 Such rhetoric represented a vestige of the pre-Enlightenment analogical paradigm for understanding the relation between human beings and the natural world, whereby the macrocosm reflected the divinely ordained structure of human life, and vice versa. As Thomas goes on to note, however, the increasingly dominant scientific demarcation between nature and society meant that any comparison between the human and the nonhuman fell more and more into disrepute during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. He cites Hartley Coleridge, who wrote in 1835 that "The real habits of animals . . . should be carefully observed and they should not be described as performing human actions to which their natural actions have no imaginable analogy or resemblance."33 Nevertheless, the interfusion of humans and nature, although strictly foreclosed from consideration by the natural and social Philip Armstrong 1047</page><page sequence="10">sciences alike, remained or returned in a variety of other forms. The ascription to animals of symbolic meanings significant to the human world remained "an article of faith for many Victorian country folk, [although] it no longer had the support of intellectuals"; moreover, "[e]ven as the older view was driven out by the scientists, it began to creep back in the form of pathetic fallacy of the Romantic poets and travelers, for whom nature served as a mirror to their own moods and emotions."'4 Moby-Dick, of course, gains much of its emotional power from its extensive and vivid deployment of precisely these popular and Romantic translations between nature and society. One legacy of the modern constitution, therefore, is that the scientific disposition came to attribute all such forms of cultural "mediation" between the human and nonhuman domains, however different they might be from one another, to a singular, simple, primitive, and superseded anthropomorphism. More recently, such effects have been understood as signs of resistance to the gathering dominance of scientific epistemology itself.35 Anthropomorphic rheto- ric, interpreted in this way, can reveal forgotten dimensions of that historical separation between the domains of nature and culture which Latour attributes to modern sociological, political, and scien- tific thought alike. As I have begun to suggest, in Moby-Dick such metaphors, as well as projecting human social structures onto ani- mals-mostly for satirical or comic effect-at times, repeatedly and seriously, demonstrate various kinds of material and practical interfusion between the human and nonhuman realms. The hypoth- esis regarding the change in whale distribution and social organiza- tion is only one instance. Others can be found in the novel's implied critique of capitalism. As Marshall Sahlins has trenchantly argued, the development of natural history during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries should be considered inextricably influenced by the concurrent maturation of the values of bourgeois capitalism: "Conceived in the image of the market system, the nature thus culturally configured has been in turn used to explain the human social order, and vice versa, in an endless reciprocal interchange between social Darwinism and natural capital- ism."36 In Moby-Dick-and in its natural historical sources-this two- way traffic between constructions of "human nature" and "nature humanized" can be observed in the moment of its establishment. To choose one well known instance from a multitude, as the sharks gather in a feeding frenzy around the corpse of a whale alongside the Pequod, Stubb goads Fleece into delivering a parodic sermon against 1048 Translations of Nature and Culture in Moby-Dick</page><page sequence="11">the sin of greed (M, 237-40). Urging the sharks to share their food in a neighborly way, the ship's cook identifies in nature the very attributes of capitalism-competition and acquisitiveness-that Sahlins identifies at work in the occult exchange between nineteenth-century economic and evolutionary theory.37 In the ensuring chapter the injured sharks are even seen greedily devouring their own entrails (M, 243). This image echoes Ishmael's suggestion that in its depen- dence upon consumption of other mammals like whales and oxen, insofar as the reader accepts their thoroughgoing humanization in the novel, the industrial economy itself must be considered inevitably and voraciously cannibalistic (M, 242).38 Moreover at such moments, which show the processes and prod- ucts of the whaling industry substantially embedded in his fellow citizens' lives, Melville goes further than his sources, who merely emphasize their nation's economic dependence upon the income from whaling.39 Contemplating American culture, the novel finds ubiquitous evidence of the material and constitutive presence of the nonhuman within the human. Arriving in New Bedford, Ishmael remarks that in spite of the barrenness of the local land, nowhere in all America will you find more patrician-like houses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford. Whence came they? how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country? Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion, and your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea. (M, 42) Moby-Dick simultaneously humanizes the whale and shows the whale voraciously consumed by humans, making visible the ways in which the lives of Melville's fellow Americans were reliant-for prosperous housing, for food and the implements with which it was consumed, for clothing and fashion, and even for the perfume of the body and the complexion of its skin-upon the consumption of the whale and other mammals. Melville's satire therefore bears out another point made by Latour, who argues that the critique of anthropomorphism-which dismisses comparisons between humans and animals as poetic license, popular sentimental error, or scientific vice-attempts to maintain the strict separation of human and nonhuman ontologies upon which moder- nity relies. In this respect, Philip Armstrong 1049</page><page sequence="12">the term "anthropomorphism" actually "underestimates our humanity," in that the "anthropos" and the "morphos" together mean both that which has human shape and that which gives shape to humans.... People thus give form to non-humans, but are themselves acted upon and given form by non-humans.40 Alongside its anthropomorphic humanizing of the whale, Melville's novel invites the reader to recognize a zoomorphic animalizing of the human, radically locating the nonhuman, the inhuman, and the inhumane within Enlightenment humanism's own most crucial and privileged category. Taken together, these processes represent a mutual interchange between the social and the natural domains. This is nowhere more apparent than in the complex of transformations and translations by which Moby-Dick manages contemporary anxi- eties arising from the economics and politics of race and gender. IV. As Melville was aware, his nation's much vaunted ideal of democ- racy depended upon the exclusion of large sectors of the adult population. Many studies have shown how Moby-Dick satirically recognizes America's dependence upon the labor of Native Ameri- cans, African American slaves, and conscripted Pacific Islanders.41 In 1953, C. L. R. James's classic study Mariners and Renegades de- scribed the novel as an allegory of the totalitarian tendencies within modern so-called democracies, particularly the management of racial difference in the service of capitalist endeavor: "The voyage of the Pequod is the voyage of modern civilization seeking its destiny."42 Ten years later, Alan Heimert provided a more detailed allegorical reading according to which the harpooners represent the various ethnicities whose disenfranchisement financed mid-nineteenth-cen- tury American prosperity: Queequeg stands for Pacific enlistees in the whale fishery, a major contributor to the Northern economy; the Gay Head Indian Tashtego evokes the ongoing dispossession of Native Americans in the West; and the "coal-black negro-savage Daggoo embodies the Southern economy's continued reliance on slavery.43 Thus Moby-Dick insistently parallels the commodification of the animal and that of nonwhite labor, for example in detailing the dangers endured by the three harpooners in processing the whale (M, 270-73), or in Ahab's demand for their blood to cool his newly forged harpoon (M, 371-72). The Pequod belongs to an industry that 1050 Translations of Nature and Culture in Moby-Dick</page><page sequence="13">consumes some humans as it consumes animals-two processes that the text understands by interfusing them. Naming the ship after an indigenous people decimated and dispossessed by the settler forbears of its white crew, comparing the whalebone included in the vessel's construction to the wearing of ivory trophies by "any barbaric Ethiopian emperor," calling it a "cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies"-the novel uses the Pequod's ingestion of Native American, African, and Pacific associations to characterize its devouring of the animal, and vice versa (M, 70).44 More recent critics who have built on the work of James and Heimert tend to emphasise the fragility and imminent crisis of mid- nineteenth-century American capitalism, and the ways in which Melville's text represents the potential for alternative modes of agency. Thus Casarino describes the novel's encapsulation of "the paradox beating at the very heart of capital . .. of having to continue to harness, exploit, and foment precisely that immanent power of production that . .. might at any given moment overflow beyond its confines, spin out of control, exceed itself, and bring about the catastrophe of a crisis beyond crisis."45 Michael Paul Rogin identifies a key moment in this impending crisis when he relates the composi- tion of Moby-Dick to a decision by Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw, who in April 1851 declared the Fugitive Slave Law constitutional, thereby returning Thomas Sims, an escaped slave, to servitude in Georgia. The verdict, which provoked public outrage, appeared to contradict Shaw's former opposition to slavery and his decision seven years earlier to free Robert Lucas, a slave brought to Massachusetts by his master aboard the ship United States. According to Rogin, the Sims judgment responded to growing fears about the threat to the Union posed by pro- and anti-slavery antagonism. But more particularly, it turned on the issue of nonwhite agency, because "Sims, unlike Lucas, had escaped from his master." The consistency between Shaw's decisions in Lucas and Sims therefore lies in a juridical determination to maintain the agency of white civility over that of black resistance: freedom could be granted only by the benevolence of white rule, whereas "Claims to freedom, by slaves against masters" would "cost them the paternal protection of the law."46 As Rogin also points out, in the same month that he delivered the Sims judgment, Shaw sent his son-in-law, Herman Melville, a copy of Owen Chase's account of the Essex sinking. In this moment of exchange, Shaw embodies simultaneously an interest in two kinds of agency-that of the animal, and that of the slave-both of which, in Philip Armstrong 1051</page><page sequence="14">different but "translatable" ways, threatened the mid-nineteenth- century American economy. These coterminous assaults upon Ameri- can confidence manifest themselves, in Melville's novel, in the intimacy of the relation between the threat represented by the agency of the animal, and that of those various human "others" upon whose labor, in 1851, American federal and economic stability remained tenuously poised. Given this mutual transference between anxieties about nonwhite and nonhuman agencies, the "Retribution, swift vengeance, eternal malice" ascribed to Moby Dick as he bears down upon the Pequod to bring about its destruction must be considered to derive simultaneously from industrial capitalism's anxiety about nonhuman agency, and from a more occult sense of those human debts which America in 1851 could scarcely admit, let alone address. This element of the democratic unconscious is thrown into sharp relief when Moby-Dick is put alongside Melville's most important fictional source: Joseph Hart's Nantucket whaling story Miriam Coffin. Hart's narrative centers less upon the agency of the animal- a ship is indeed sunk by a whale, but only accidentally, as it thrashes about in its flurry-than upon its anxiety about human "savages," embodied initially by the murderous Native American Quibby, and later by the aggressive islanders who attack the ship in the Pacific.47 Replacing these malign or bellicose primitives with the erotically primordial but acquiescent noble savages Queequeg, Tashtego, and Daggoo, and replacing an accidentally destructive whale with the intentionally vengeful Moby Dick, Melville transfers the threat posed to modern America by its economic dependence upon various disenfranchised human elements onto the White Whale -which "swam before [Ahab] as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them" (M, 156). V. The reliance of American mid-nineteenth-century democracy and economics upon the labor and lives of another disenfranchised population, however, remains rather less visible. Again this becomes apparent when Moby-Dick is compared with its precursor. Just as it displays overt paranoia about ethnic otherness, Hart's novel struggles explicitly with the role of women in the industrial economy. Miriam Coffin parallels the narrative about the voyages of two vessels, the Grampus and the Leviathan, with the activities of the eponymous character who, with her husband at sea, enters into the masculine 1052 Translations of Nature and Culture in Moby-Dick</page><page sequence="15">sphere of entrepreneurial capitalism with considerable virtuosity. However, Miriam's business skills, which include speculation on credit rather than existing assets, the undercutting of competitors, and the fostering of business confidence through conspicuous con- sumption-tactics that might inspire admiration in today's money market-bring disaster in Hart's novel, and are roundly condemned by her husband on his return: "Get thee gone to thy kitchen, where it is fitting thou should'st preside . . . and do thou never meddle with men's affairs more!"48 Melville, however, represses the possibility of female economic and cultural agency altogether by utterly excluding women characters from his novel. But although women may be all but absent from the novel, femininity is not. On the contrary, Moby-Dick exemplifies a historically specific modification of gender codes, effected through complex transfers between nature and culture. Mid-nineteenth- century human masculinity and femininity, and the zoology of sexual difference, are used to define each other, and to naturalize the resulting gender ideology. Most obviously, Melville describes in "The Grand Armada"-the moment at which, in the middle of the novel, Ishmael gazes into the profound and mystical center of the sperm whale's social organization-precisely that gendered separation into supposedly complementary spheres of activity that was concurrently at work in American society, "as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked up in this innermost fold": But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent; and as human infants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast... even so did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at us, as if we were but a bit of Gulf-weed in their new-born sight. Floating on their sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. (M, 302-3) The rhetoric of calm, transparency, and immediacy pervading this passage seems to guarantee its verisimilitude: here, of all the descrip- tions of whales offered by the novel, it appears to promise the reader a clear view of the intimate natural life of the animal, devoid of literary or symbolic coloration. Philip Armstrong 1053</page><page sequence="16">Of course this is far from being the case. As Vincent has argued, the passage draws closely upon descriptions of nursing whales in Melville's favored sources.49 Furthermore, the comparison with hu- man infants hints at a simultaneous co-construction of the natural history of the whale and the social life of nineteenth-century Ameri- cans. As Ann Douglas points out, the economic and cultural position of women in the American Northeast underwent a profound change during the first half of the nineteenth century. Industrial manufac- ture replaced female domestic labor, which had played a vital economic role during the so called "Age of Homespun" at the end of the eighteenth century, with a consequent loss in "self-reliance and social responsibility" for women. Education for young girls, instead of teaching them to be home workers, now trained them to spend their husbands' incomes, and their manual involvement in the material economy was substituted with an exorbitant cult of maternity: "Praise of motherhood could bolster and promote the middle-class woman's biological function as tantamount, if not superior, to her lost eco- nomic productivity."'50 The central nursery idyll of "The Grand Armada" evidently and vividly partakes of this apotheosis of human motherhood, while at the same time, typically, Melville implies that these whales, even the mothers and newborn offspring, are simply resources waiting to be harvested. Although critical attention has been paid to the footnote appended to this passage, which extends the comparison between cetacean and human reproductive and nursery habits, it has seldom been noticed that an economic impera- tive cuts violently through the idealized maternal imagery:51 When by chance these precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter's lance, the mother's pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolor the sea for rods. The milk is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by men; it might do well with strawberries. (M, 303 n. 7) This characteristic juxtaposition of an emotional humanization of the whale and a brutal recognition of its consumption comes very close to an admission of the price paid by both the animal and the human female for their place within industrial capitalism. All the same, I think Douglas overestimates the author's inten- tional commitment to the politics of gender equality when she concludes that "Melville consistently produced a literature of inclu- siveness. What his society would not allow him to conceive-sexual equality, a non-oppressive economic system, an honest culture-he 1054 Translations of Nature and Culture in Moby-Dick</page><page sequence="17">also included by making his work a recognition of the price of their loss."5" But she does point out one important moment at which the novel does not ignore its own exclusion of women.53 The last extended exchange between Ahab and Starbuck prior to the meeting with Moby Dick-the moment at which Ahab most nearly turns back from his destructive course-involves the Captain's recognition of the damage produced by the economic separation between the genders: Forty years of continual whaling! . . . for forty years has Ahab forsaken the peaceful land, for forty years to make war on the horrors of the deep! . .. away, whole oceans away, from that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and sailed for Cape Horn the next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow-wife? wife?-rather a widow with her husband alive! .. . Starbuck; let me look into a human eye .... By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is the magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye. (M, 405-6) But despite Starbuck's appeal to his affection for home and family, Ahab cannot turn back: "[W]hat cozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor commands me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep pushing, and crowding, and jamming myself on all the time . . . ?" (M, 406). The novel implies a psychological or ontological answer to this question, but Ahab's monomaniac drive, frequently represented in reference to industrial technology-"The path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is grooved to run" (M, 143)-can equally be read as a metaphysical by-product of the industrial economy's impact upon the gender organization of mid-nineteenth-century America, a mythopoeic sublimation of an economically motivated separation of men and women into widely demarcated economic zones. Such an interpretation is borne out by the case of John DeBlois, captain of the Ann Alexander. Although Melville could not have had access while writing his novel either to the letters of DeBlois or to his account of the sinking of his ship by a whale, these documents attest to the exaggerated bifurcation of masculine and feminine spheres of activity resulting from the peculiar demands of the whaling industry. DeBlois, according to Clement Cleveland Sawtell, was completely fearless and reckless of life, limb and equipment in the pursuit of whales, and expected others whom he lead [sic] to be the same. He was tireless, driving his ship, his crew and himself as long as there was a ray of light in the sky. . . . And finally, above all Philip Armstrong 1055</page><page sequence="18">else, he resented long voyages that separated him from his wife, Henrietta, to whom he was deeply and undyingly devoted. For this reason and perhaps others he could not bear to miss a single whale, no matter how elusive, no matter how vicious, no matter how long the chase. Each fighting whale almost became, it seems, his personal antagonist, to be killed, no matter what the cost, and the final cost, as it turned out was his ship.54 The letters written by DeBlois to his wife, which Sawtell reproduces, testify to the adventurous, entrepreneurial mode of capitalism em- bodied by whaling captains, and to the impact of that habitus upon an increasingly exaggerated bifurcation between the genders. Indeed, so harsh was this enforced separation that, years after the sinking of the Ann Alexander, Henrietta DeBlois actually took ship with her husband on board the Merlin on 25 June 1856. In fact, by the mid-century, a number of whaling wives were transgressing the gender roles implied by the industry. One of the first to do so, Mary Brewster, accompanied her husband aboard the Tiger, out of Stonington, Connecticut in 1845, and again in 1848. She recorded her delight at meeting Betsy Tower, wife of the captain of the New Bedford whaler Moctezuma, during a "gam" off Cape Horn in 1847. Other women taking ship at the time Melville was writing include Azubah Cash, who sailed from Nantucket aboard the Columbia in October 1850 and remained beside her husband on his voyages for the next several years, and Harriet Peirce, who stood by her man as the Kutusoff left New Bedford in the following year.55 Although such cases represented only a small minority within the fishery, the determined infiltration of the factory ship by these women provides a sharp contrast to the exclusive masculinism of Moby-Dick's portrayal of contemporary whaling subculture. For Melville's novel deter- minedly banishes women beyond the perimeters of the whaling enterprise: they remain locked into an association with the "marriage pillow," "the green land," "the bright hearth-stone," permitted aboard the Pequod only in the idealized portrait that Ahab, in an atypical moment, imagines reflected in his first mate's eye. Ahab's idyll, and his relentless pursuit of the whale, therefore represent the strictest imaginable adherence to the organization of gendered spheres of activity dictated by an industrializing economy, which required strengthened opposition between an aggressive, courageous, and active masculinity and a tender, nurturing, and passive femininity-complementary gender dispositions consonant with, respectively, the competitive and acquisitive arena of capitalist 1056 Translations of Nature and Culture in Moby-Dick</page><page sequence="19">enterprise and the sanctum of the privatized nuclear family. More- over, the novel illustrates how these attributes came to be located in nature. Just as a contemporary cult of American motherhood informs Ishmael's paean to the whale nursery in "The Grand Armada," the subsequent chapter discovers in bull whales the "naturally" opposing virtues of masculinity: "In cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his ladies" (M, 305). The chapter then distinguishes between these "harem" schools, comprising females guarded by a single male, and the "schools composing none but young and vigorous males": while those female whales are characteristically timid, the young males, or forty-barrel-bulls, as they call them, are by far the most pugnacious of all the Leviathans, and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter; excepting those wondrous greyheaded, grizzled whales. . . . Like a mob of young collegians, [the young males] are full of fight, fun and wickedness, tumbling round the world at . . . a reckless, rollicking rate. . . . They soon relinquish this turbulence though, and when about three fourths grown, break up, and separately go about in quest of settlements, that is, harems. Another point of difference between the male and female schools is still more characteristic of the sexes. Say you strike a Forty- barrel bull-poor devil! all his comrades quit him. But strike a member of the harem school, and her companions swim around her with every token of concern, sometimes lingering so near her and so long, as themselves to fall a prey. (M, 307) In this passage, a process that still characterizes wildlife documenta- ries today operates at full power, whereby human sociological "truth" and natural historical "fact" are engaged in a mutual authorization that irons out all contradictions. So, for instance, the inconsistency between the purported timidity of the females and their refusal to escape when their companions are struck is explained by an appeal to a femininity-animal and human-that finds its highest calling in maternity, which requires a deferential but intractable "concern" for the well-being of others at the expense of the self. And the incongru- ent combination of pugnacity and cowardice in the character of young males is processed into coherence by a notion of masculinity that manifests in youth as a reckless but selfish aggressivity, and in maturity by a courageous protection of the weaker members of the social order. In short, an entire sociology and psychology of gender, Philip Armstrong 1057</page><page sequence="20">class, educational and social development-perfectly evolved to suit the economics of industrial capitalism-is being advanced by means of its interfusion with cetacean ethology. Evidently, only a heroicization of the male leviathan could prop- erly elevate his human antagonists to epic heights, thereby glorifying the whaling industry and the expansionist industrial capitalism that it represented. Hence, only the male rogue whales were ever made famous as individuals by being given names: New Zealand Tom, Mocha Dick, Timor Jack, Don Miguel. That captains saw the encounter with such animals as a contest of masculinities is again attested by DeBlois, who described a whale that had already de- stroyed several boats and would eventually sink his ship as a "Noble fellow," admitting that the increasing danger only strengthened his resolve "to secure this 'fighting whale.' . . . My blood was up, and I was fully determined to have that whale, cost what it might."56 In the same manner, Reynolds immortalized Mocha Dick as a "renowned monster, who had come off victorious in a hundred fights with his pursuers," and his vanquisher as an embodiment of the free, unpre- tentious, everyday heroism of the worker under capitalism, "of a spirit of fearless independence, generated by free institutions.""'57 Nevertheless, the kinds of self contradiction that betray the work of gender construction emerge even in this apologia for virile capitalist endeavour, because in Reynolds's narrative, the fight with Mocha Dick actually occurs after, and in relation to, an attack upon the whaleboat initiated by a female sperm whale.58 To be sure, this animal attacks only after her calf has been killed by the whalers, which helps to assimilate this evidence of feminine courage and aggression into the category of maternal care. On the other hand, Reynolds makes equally clear that Mocha Dick's attacks were always motivated by a desire to extract "vengeance" for the slaughter of his companion whales, so the only remaining trait that identifies the bull whale as a more willing, ferocious, and effective fighter than the cow is his greater size. Similar contradictions appear in the natural historical accounts upon which Melville drew, where again they show the ideological complicity between natural history and human sociology. Most strik- ing of all is the confusion, amongst Moby-Dick's source texts, about whether the male or the female sperm whale was more liable to become "mischievous." Beale and Bennett, for example, agree that the nurturing tendencies of the females inclined them to remain with their wounded companions, while the young males would swiftly 1058 Translations of Nature and Culture in Moby-Dick</page><page sequence="21">abandon their fellows.59 Moreover, Bennett explicitly discounts the suggestion, advanced by Melville, that the most formidable oppo- nents of the whalers were old solitary bulls, asserting instead that "[a]n old female, and a half-grown male, are considered the most troublesome to encounter, from their active and combative temper."60 In fact, firsthand accounts by nineteenth century whaling writers of female fighting whales are not hard to find.61 They are simply easy to overlook, for they were attributed with a far lower degree of significance than the epic battles with their larger male counter- parts-precisely because, as I have suggested, the gender politics of nineteenth-century human family life and the complementary eco- nomics of industrial capitalism required that the true "fighting" or "mischievous" whale necessarily be perceived as masculine. Such determined assertions of gender difference arise from the "crisis of gender re-organization" afflicting mid-nineteenth-century America, "a sharpening of the separation between the public and economically productive sphere of men and the private sphere of home, family, and culture reserved for women." The outrageous masculinism that pervades Moby-Dick thus comprises the necessary complement to the maternal idyll at its heart: "What is the hunt for the enormous sperm whale Moby Dick if not a quest for absolute potency, a quest in which the aggressive assertion of masculine strength calls up a fantastically enlarged version of that strength as its imagined nemesis?""62 This exorbitant virility dictates the periphrases employed by Ishmael to refer to the whale's penis, "longer than a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at the base, and jet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg" (M, 324), and permeates his account of the crew's manipulation of congealed lumps of spermaceti, in preparation for trying out: I squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers' hands in it, mistaking their hands for the gentle globules. Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was continually squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes sentimentally; as much as to say .... Come; let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into each other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness. (M, 322-33) Here, as everywhere in the novel, the conceptual and commercial processing of the animal becomes inextricably associated with a Philip Armstrong 1059</page><page sequence="22">shared masculinity, lovingly rendered as a sensuous homoeroticism that utterly excludes the feminine, or else replaces it-in this passage, even the proverbial "milk of human kindness" becomes transmuted into a more manly substance. Such extravagant representations of difference vividly illustrate, I have argued, the ubiquitous mutual construction of nineteenth- and twentieth-century scientific and sociological epistemologies, and the concomitant naturalization of the racial and gendered economy required by capitalist modernity. At the same time Moby-Dick challenges these representations, by producing and juxtaposing them so prolifically, energetically, and exorbitantly that they are strained to the breaking point and beyond.63 Hence, even as the novel docu- ments America's consumption of the bodies and energies of women, people of color, and nonhumans, it ironically represents the fragility of the naturo-cultural network of modernity, and anticipates its imminent collapse and subsequent decay.

SThe converse of Burke's vision of the civilizing influence of American whalers is best represented by Henry Cheever in his 1850 book The Whale and His Captors (Fairfield, WA: Ye Galleon Press, 1991); for Cheever, whaling proved morally debilitating because of the brutalizing nature of the trade, long absences from hearth and home, and exposure to the godless cultures of the Pacific and elsewhere. 8 For his detailed descriptions of the factory ship's processing of whales, Melville draws upon J.
