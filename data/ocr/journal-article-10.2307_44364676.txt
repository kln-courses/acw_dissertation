She is one of my absolute favorites. In her writing about life and food, she is reliably generous of spirit, life lessons and wisdom. Ms. Reichl 's work reads so easily, I assumed she loves the writing process and that nothing is more natural for her than putting word to page. I was surprised and relieved to read her say, "I hate writing. I love having written." I can really relate to this sentiment. I've wondered for a long time if the regular wresding match I experience when I sit down to write indicates that I am not really meant to be writing. I seem to exhale only once I've completed a step or phase in my project. I am unrelentingly uncomfortable until I do. If Ruth Reichl experiences it, then it's OK that I do. (Thanks again, Ruth!) Chase Polan Scottsdale, Ariz. I enjoyed Robert Atwan's essay "A Note on 'Death of a Pig,"' (Issue 41). In discussing E.B.White's essay, Atwan writes elegandy about how authors tweak the facts to create mood or narrative in a personal essay. I think of this gambit as "unconscious imagination," although many writers employ it deliberately. "For literary purposes," Atwan argues, "White invented a narrative self who has to remain unaware of all the pertinent information the author himself could easily have accessed. . . . White apparendy decided that for him to determine, from available evidence, which day the pig died would be less aesthetically satisfying than for him to maintain the illusion of uncertainty." This is an excellent point. White concentrated on mood and atmosphere. He was a renowned writer who used narrative details to buttress his painstakingly crafted persona as a befuddled Everyman. I think Atwan's best point is that "identity transfers" occur often in White's essays. Like Proust and Dickens, White couldn't keep his mind in his own body. His novelistic imagination - his version of whatThoreau called "sympathy" - invested everything around him with his own whimsy and melancholy. I find this tendency one of White 's most appealing and original traits. Paul Theroux, on the other hand, complained in the December 2006 Smithsonian that White's rampant anthropomorphism in writing about geese reduced the quality of his observations. I would argue the opposite. White's whimsical empathy is the foundation of his ability to make us feel kinship with others. Unquestionably, he sometimes permits his imaginative response to the world - to incident and character - to shape his narrative. A simple, inconsequential experience gains artistic resonance in the mind of the reader and in E.B.White's evolving history of his own life. My favorite example of what Mr. Atwan calls "identity transfer" occurs • in White's best novel. While he was composing "Charlotte's Web," his authorial imagination leaped from villain to victim because on the real-life farm that inspired the novel, the only character threatening to murder a pig was E.B. White himself. Michael Sims Pittsburgh, Pa. Author of "The Story of Charlotte's Web" Rebecca Butorac (AfterWORDS, Issue 42) is browsing the wrong stacks. Segregating creative nonfiction or literary journalism or whatever into its own little ghetto on bookstore and library shelves would be a terrible, possibly fatal mistake. This kind of writing is, above all, about something: the death of a beloved spouse, murder in Kansas, the siege of the Pentagon, Hell's Angels. ...Whatever the topic, there is a topic, and it is primary in the writer's mind, at least in the beginnings If we start rounding up the best of what we prize under some artificial and inadequate category, we announce to the world that</page><page sequence="2">this kind of writing really doesn't matter. Is irrelevant, a branch of belles-lettres. Librarians love order, God bless them. Given the chance, they'll organize pocket lint. Good writers love writing - and what they're writing about. (Does Lawrence Wright want his forthcoming book filed under creative nonfiction or under the Church of Scientology?) The same may be true of college courses on creative nonfiction, though here I realize I'm wading into darker waters. But no writer ever produced anything of worth without first being curious about some subject and then wondering if she had something interesting to say about it. Bill Marvel Dallas, Tx. Always is one of those dangerous words. For one writer, David Shields, nonfiction is always actually fiction. For a few irritable and argumentative readers, both nonfiction and fiction writers have to get all the facts right - always. I understand them as I understand all arguments. Everything is true at some angle or another. And also not true. A few years ago, I became dizzy reading narrative theory with some theorists pointing out that every written thing is always first person (actually) and that everything is also past tense. You understand the argument. Even an omniscient third- person point of view is coming from one mind. Even a present tense story (which most of the time suggests a past) is past as soon as it has passed the hps of the teller/ keystrokes of the writer. Arguments are terrific in that they make us think. Phillip Lopate's essay (Issue 42) insisting he knows what he is about when he works is sheer fun to read, and it articulates well the idea that nonfiction is not fiction if one's intent is to record something without making anything up. Fiction writers go into all kinds of pretzel twists over questions of fact and fiction. I forgive Michael Cunningham for those disputable images in "A Home at the End of the World" whether they came of intention or not. There are a lot of facts in any fiction. When I wrote my first mystery/ thriller, I called police, newspapers, attorneys, adoption agencies ... all kinds of places for information. I learned about an adoption scheme from the FBI that I did not put into print because I didn't want to contribute to criminal behavior. So I was making decisions, sorting. I believed, however, that I had that right - a right we call "poetic license." Although Ralph's Discount City had closed, I opened it again in my pages. I had my incipient lovers coming up out of the Gateway Center garage into the sunlight. The sudden light made them blink in that sweet, vulnerable way of people caught off guard. I got a phone call as soon as the book was released; the caller told me egress from the Gateway Center garage did not bring people into the light. Well, I hadn't paid $20 to park and find out. So. Yes, some people care. Some comb books looking for errors. I am more careful now. I check out many things - and it's fun to do. Still, I make mistakes. Everyone does. And when I get something really wrong, like a road that doesn't go where I say it does, somebody is likely to tell me. But I'm better at checking than I used to be. For a person who gives so litde time to the real world, who is geographically challenged, I'm fairly audacious in tapping those realnesses for my purposes. Kathleen George Pittsburgh, Pa. Author of "Hideout" ABOUT THE ILLUSTRATIONS: The creation of illustrations for this issue was supported by a Small Arts Initiative grant from the Heinz Endowments. The Heinz Endowments supports efforts to make southwestern Pennsylvania a premier place to live and work, a center for learning and educational excellence, and a region that embraces diversity and inclusion. Michael Lotenero, whose work is featured in this issue, divides his time between Pittsburgh and Brooklyn, N.Y. His work has appeared in TIME, The Wall Street Journal, Big Magazine and others, and in galleries in Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York. About his work for Creative Nonfiction, Lotenero says, "I wanted to make these works for the anger and revenge issue seem as physical and emotional as the words that were written. I created the bloodlike spatters by throwing paint and coffee- and paint-soaked rags at the canvasses, then I studied the shapes, painting around the textures and marks to form the subjects, making sense and shape of the initial damage."
