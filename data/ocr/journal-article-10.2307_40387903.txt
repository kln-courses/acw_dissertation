<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROSENBERG, Alex. Darwinian Reductionism: Or, How to Stop Worrying and Love Molecular Biology. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, Ï‡ + 263 pp. Cloth, $40.00 - Three m^jor concerns inform this work. The foremost is the dualism held to exist between the physical realm and the biological, which Rosenberg tells us is predominant amongst those who think about philosophical issues in biology. Another concern is the logi- cal status of the Darwinian principle of natural selection, often referred to as "survival of the fittest." If it is asked who are the "fittest," the only properly Darwinian answer is "those who survive." But then this princi- ple would seem to be a mere tautology without empirical content, and so unfalsifiable. A further concern is the doctrine of genetic determin- ism, which says that human characteristics such as intelligence and mo- rality are inexorably determined by specific genes. Rosenberg argues that the dualism (held even by most Darwinians) is untenable and lends credence to such "spooky" notions as intelligent de- sign and vitalism. He hopes to correct this by broadening Darwin's prin- ciple to include the physical, macromolecular realm. This "Darwinian reductionism" would not only vindicate the principle of natural selec- tion but also, in doing so, refute the genetic determinism advocated by such as Richard Dawkins and James Watson. Any morally sensitive and politically informed thinker, Rosenberg says, should find this kind of de- terminism simply inadmissible. It can be seen that Rosenberg's book tackles very difficult issues in the philosophy of biology in subtle and in- novative ways. The dualism Rosenberg speaks of is not a full fledged one, in that it does allow that biological phenomena are metaphysically reducible to physical ones: this is the "physicalist" thesis that there is only one kind of stuff out of which everything in the universe is built, that described by physics and chemistry. It is still a dualism, however, because it holds that properly biological explanations are not reducible to macromolecu- lar ones. Ever since the scientific revolution physics and chemistry have eschewed any semblance of final causality in their nomological ex- planations. But biology generally does not seek to find laws of nature as physics and chemistry do; rather it employs end-directed or functional</page><page sequence="2">424 BRANDON ZIMMERMAN AND STAFF explanations. The performance of a single function can be realized by multiple physical systems; hence, there is no single structure realizing a given function that that function is reducible to. In terms of identity the- ory, there is a token-type correspondence between the physiochemical and the biological, but no type-type one. Rosenberg, indeed, admits the force of this dualistic position, and re- lies on a concept in computational theory to illustrate and legitimate it. This is the well known principle that for any computable function, there exist distinct multiple programs that will compute it. Although Rosen- berg does not mention it, this principle is formalized by the theorem that it is impossible to decide, based on examination of internal structure alone, whether two given (distinct) algorithms will compute a given function. Hence, no necessary structural similarity exists between dis- tinct algorithms that do in fact compute the same function. Rosenberg argues that recent advances in molecular biology strongly indicate that the genetic material inside cells instantiates a program for embryo development. DNA sequences are literally program codes. It still may not be very well known to the educated public, but a great many biologists and philosophers maintain DNA is not a code contain- ing all the information needed for embryogenesis. Rather, they say, em- bryogenesis is crucially influenced by the cytoplasmic and the multicel- lular environment, so that there is a kind of downward causation where the whole affects DNA expression as much or more than the reverse. Moreover, DNA might simply be a set of triggers which themselves con- tain no information, just as the buttons on a jukebox are not codes for the recording but rather simply trigger the sequence leading to playing the recording. The cytoplamic and multicellular environment contains the "information," not the trigger. Given that DNA does literally embody a program, says Rosenberg, it must be the case that, just as many programs can compute a single func- tion, many different DNA sequences can 'compute' the same develop- mental outcome. Because there is no one to one correspondence be- tween DNA structure and development, knowledge of a particular DNA sequence gives us no knowledge of invariable laws of nature. Indeed, the genetic material itself could have had a very different chemical com- position, and still would have performed the same function. This con- trasts with the laws of chemical interaction (say, how oxygen combines with hydrogen), which are invariable. Rosenberg theorizes that the actual DNA sequences responsible for particular developmental outcomes are "frozen accidents" of random variation and natural selection. Some macromolecules were able to rep- licate themselves and have some measure of stability (but not too much stability, else they could not have the complexity necessary to self-repli- cate) such that were able to survive and continue to replicate in the pri- mordial chemical stew. This happens to have given rise to the first prim- itive genetic material. Thus, the principle of natural selection holds not only for organisms but also for macromolecules. Rosenberg, in fact, ar- gues that the principle of natural selection is not only a principle operat- ing in our particular biosphere, but also more generally, a physical law operating throughout the universe. In this way, it appears, he wants to deal with the tautology problem adverted to earlier. The principle of</page><page sequence="3">SUMMARIES AND COMMENTS 425 natural selection only seems tautological, because it is so broad and per- vasive. Yet Rosenberg wants to say that it is still a law, and thus pre- sumably falsifiable. In arguing for the notion that a given DNA program for a function is a frozen accident of evolution, Rosenberg performs a kind of judo move on those Darwinians who insist that organismic biology cannot be re- duced to molecular. The very lack of a type-type correspondence be- tween structure and function, which is held to be the basis of such an- tireductionism, turns out to be the clue to how reductionism is valid. For the lack of such correspondence shows that macromolecular struc- tures are themselves accidental results of natural selection. Reduction- ism is accomplished by showing that natural selection is a unifying natu- ral law. Rosenberg also uses this lack of one to one correspondence to argue against what he calls genetic determinism. While there might be a single "gene for" sickle cell anemia, he says, there could never be a single gene for something as complex as, say, intelligence. Undeniably, intelligence, like everything else, is genetically determined (although Rosenberg does seem to admit some influence of the environment), but we will never be able to predict, based on an examination of genetic material alone, the level of intelligence a fertilized egg will attain. For Rosenberg "scary" determinism is thus refuted. This might offer cold comfort for those who wish to maintain a stron- ger version of antideterminism. Moreover, Rosenberg's elevation of Darwinism to an invariable law might strike one as an extreme case of anthropomorphism, in that it takes a doctrine of human economic inter- action (Adam Smith) to be universally applicable. Rosenberg's insis- tence on random variation as the sole factor of variability might fit in well with the now discredited central dogma of molecular biology, which says that interaction between the genetic material in the nucleus and the outer cellular environment is strictly one way. One can point to Barbara Mclintock's (at first largely ignored) work in the 1940's - for which she finally won the Noble Prize in 1983 - showing that stress on a cell leads to DNA transpositions. The discovery of retroviruses and re- verse transcription, where RNA affects the DNA in the nucleus, also opens up the possibility that organisms can affect their own genetic makeup. - Edward M.
