<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HISPANIC WORLD Conducted by ROBERT G. MEAD, JR.* Literatura mexicana.-Bajo los auspicios del Centro Mexicano de Escritores y con la intenci6n de discutir la literatura mexi- cana se reunieron varios escritores los dias 6, 7 y 8 de julio de 1964 en el auditorio de la Secretaria de Comunicaciones, M6xi- co, D.F. Participaron en estas discusiones Juan Jose Arreola, Juan Rulfo, el Dr. Fran- cisco Monterde, Margarita Urueta, Sidney Wise, el Dr. Manuel Pedro Gonzailez, Keith Botsford, Robie Macauley, Edmundo Valades y Arturo Arnaiz y Freg, mode- rador. La reuni6n que mis entusiasm6 a todos fue la segunda. Ese dia se propusieron varias interrogantes y la discusi6n comenz6 lentamente. Juan Jose Arreola trat6 de con- testar a la primera: ?es posible que el ar- tista transmita directamente su respuesta emocional a los acontecimientos humanos? Dijo que lo importante para 1l es la reali- dad que se transforma, la que se elabora. Arreola afirm6 que Martin Luis Guzmain en sus obras solamente refleja la realidad. Luego tom6 la palabra Juan Rulfo; explic6 que a su manera de pensar hay cuatro formas de realidad: la elaborada, la refle- jada, la imaginada, y la creada. En cuanto a Martin Luis Guzmain, Rulfo se opuso en parte a lo dicho por Arreola. Para Rulfo Martin Luis Guzmain refleja la realidad artisticamente; en cambio, Rafael F. Mufioz imagina la realidad. Despues intervinieron otros en el debate y hubo un intercambio de ideas sobre varios temas hasta que le toco hablar al escritor norteamericano Keith Botsford. En la re- sefia que el Excelsior titul6 "Apasionada Polkmica Sobre la Literatura Mexicana" se escribi6 lo siguiente: ".Cree usted que los escritores mexicanos en general tienen preferencia por algunas de estas alternativas? "Claro, dijo Botsford, tienen sus preferencias. Pero aquf la libertad, y esto es a riesgo de que sea linchado en este pais, existe en una forma particular. La verdad en Mexico se ve con mucha dificultad. No se puede hablar de todo directamente. "La literatura de M6xico, insisti6, parece una literatura que no ve todavia la totalidad de Mexico. No tiene una ironia de si misma." Como medio de enlace intervino Arnaiz y Freg. Con su particular entonaci6n, el maestro dijo a Botsford: -Nos da mucho gusto contar con este tipo de agente provocador de un rango intelectual y virol6gico como el de Botsford, pero creo que confunde a su propio pais, los Estados Unidos, con el nuestro. -Aqui agreg6 Arnaiz, no se lincha todavia. La Constituci6n estai en vigor y todo esclavo negro que cruce nUlestra frontera recupera su libertad . . . El p~iblico no dej6 seguir a Arnaiz y Freg y lo premi6 con un aplauso y risas. Cedi6 el micr6fono a Margarita Urueta quien habl6 del absurdo en la literatura mexicana como una forma de ironia. "El absurdo aqui, agreg6, es un recurso para no hablar de la realidad escueta. Ademas, los escritores mexicanos estamos reprimidos por la tradici6n espafiola. "Creo que la ironia existe, pero esto es muy trigico. Y, en veces, hay que pensar en la derecha, en la izquierda o en el centro para escribir," dice Margarita Urueta . . . Para entonces Juan Rulfo, raro en 1l, exigia el micr6fono, estaba nervioso, intentaba volver al punto inicial de la discusi6n como habia sido planteado por Arreola. Ripido, ripido, expres6: "iBah!, ahora ya hemos aumentado las posi- bilidades de la realidad. Ya no son las cuatro solamente: la elaborada, la reflejada, la imagi- nada, la creada; son tambien realidad, la del absurdo, la de la ironia, la de la mentira ." Juan Jose Arreola sale en defensa de la litera- tura mexicana. Dice que apenas se acerca a la madurez. Seria pesimista un balance sobre ella si se pretendiera hablar de la literatura hecha aqui hace tres siglos. "La verdadera literatura mexicana, afiade, nace despues de la Revoluci6n."' Y en seguida hace una visi6n de la tradici6n espafiola. Arreola no ve madurez en la literatura mexicana como consecuencia de que toda la cultura de habla espafiola esti en crisis. Ha sido grande desde Berceo hasta el Siglo de Oro, pero el descubrimiento de Am6rica parece haber roto la lengua y el genio de Espafia deja de em- * Members are urged to send items for this de- partment, properly typed, to Professor George Schanzer, Dept. of Modern Languages and Literature, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, N.Y. 14214.

La lengua espafiola que habia sido estructu- rada se encuentra de pronto en America con un nuevo paisaje dificil de entender. En M6xico no hay una lengua definida y hasta en nuestra epoca el espafiol es dificil. Se padece, pues, un espiritu de retraso. Hay una perdida de "tiempo" hist6rico y, dice Arreola, 'no queremos perder el tiempo y hacemos, como en Argentina, un acopio de estilos y de formas, la antinovela, etc... Arnaiz y Freg empieza a interrumpirlo. Arreola ha acaparado el micr6fono. Juan Jos6 antes de cortar dice: "Laistima que no pueda hablar . Y su frase es coreada con risas y aplausos por el puiblico. Habia hablado cerca de diez minutos seguidos. La raz6n de Arnaiz y Freg era que Juan Rulfo le pedia la palabra. Esta vez Rulfo no titube6. Firme en su expresi6n dijo: "Bien, como dice Arreola.

" Habl6 el doctor Francisco Monterde. La ironia del escritor mexicano es para 61 un recurso legitimo y su propio derecho de protesta. El maestro Monterde presenta al escritor espafiol (sic) Manuel Pedro Gonzalez, quien se ha dedicado a dar a conocer las letras mexicanas a partir de la novela de la Revoluci6n y, en especial, a partir de Mariano Azuela. Interviene Manuel Pedro Gonzalez. La Revo- luci6n Mexicana, dice, tuvo la virtud de revelar M6xico a los mexicanos y asi produjo un nuevo tipo de arte literario, plistico, etc6tera. "Mariano Azuela, en plena Revoluci6n, agrega, corta el cord6n umbilical de la literatura mexi- cana con su pasado espafiol . Intervinieron todos. Menos Sidney Wise, que esta del lado izquierdo de la mesa. "Es un wise- man, seguramente," comenta el moderador. (El Excelsior 8 de julio de 1964) ALBERTO J. CARLOS State Univ. of New York at Albany Sigue una polemica.-En H i s p an i a (mayo de 1964) se han publicado algunas de las respuestas a una encuesta entre pro- fesores norteamericanos Ilevado a cabo por el Fondo de Cultura Econ6mica de Mdxi- co, y publicada en su La Gaceta. En primer lugar se queria saber si los distinguidos cate- dr~ticos de literatura iberoamericana no estaban de acuerdo en creer que se podia aprender tanto sobre la vida de los paises hispanos por la lectura de novelas, ensayos y cuentos que por el estudio de estadisticas o informes tdcnicos. Claro que esto es pre- cisamente la doctrina que los hispanistas casi todos profesamos y la pregunta parece equivalente a preguntarle al marxista si cree en Karl Marx. Pero no nos precipi- temos; hay un hereje en el templo. He aqui que el profesor Enrique Anderson Imbert responde que "la literatura no tiene nada que ver con las estadisticas ni con informes tdcnicos ni con la verdad." Y afiade que la literatura que documenta la realidad, a pesar de ser la mis cuantiosa, es tambidn la peor. Curiosas son las conclusiones que se pudiera sacar de las observaciones del pro- fesor Anderson. Si la literatura buena no tiene nada que ver con la verdad, entonces no se adonde dirigirme para dar con ella: ?seri la que trata de mundos inventados y distintos del nuestro? ?o seri la literatura de fantasia como el cuento "Leve Pedro" del propio Anderson? Pero me parece que a pesar de todo, esta clase de literatura se aprecia precisamente por lo que revela de nuestra realidad de todos los dias. Si se inventa un mundo distinto del nuestro (como en un cuento de Borges) ino es a base del contraste con el mundo conocido que podemos comprenderlo? Y ese mismo leve Pedro que cada dia se ponia mis leve hasta que un dia a pesar de todas las luchas y precauciones sali6 de casa y vo16 hasta desaparecer entre las nubes, ino es una alegoria sobre la vida de todos, en que cada dia nos acercamos mis a la muerte</page><page sequence="3">150 HISPANIA hasta que un dia se acaba todo apego a la vida? De modo que lo fantaistico tambien se relaciona con la realidad. ?Y c6mo decir entonces que la literatura no tiene nada que ver con la verdad? Ademais si es cierto que cuanto menos se basa la literatura en la realidad tanto mejor es ella, habrni que emprender la tarea de cambiar toda la propaganda que em- pleamos los hispanistas para inducir a que se estudie la literatura hispanoamericana. Nos veremos sin duda obligados a clasificar los cursos en dos grupos: I. Obras literarias malas de las que se aprende, sin embargo, mucho sobre la vida y civilizaci6n hispainicas. II. Obras buenas de que se puede aprender el arte de la hermosa estructura literaria sin preocupaciones hist6ricas ni cul- turales. Todos nos damos cuenta que la litera- tura debe poseer un minimo de belleza, de elegancia o de espiritu podtico para califi- carse de literatura mais bien que periodismo. Pero de ahi a decir que no importa que revele mucho ni poco de las condiciones de vida en las Amdricas hay mucha dis- tancia. Todos sabemos ademris que una obra literaria solo puede aspirar a darnos una imagen de la realidad vista atrav6s de un temperamento. Pero protestamos contra la idea de que la literatura no tenga nada que ver con la verdad y aun aseguramos, al rev's de Anderson, que cuanto mais se revela de la realidad del alma y vida latino- americanas tanto mejor seri no s6lo para el prop6sito de ensefiar sino tambien in- trinsecamente. Villanova Univ. DONALD F. BROWN Nikos Kazantzakis.-His book, translated by Amy Mims, (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1963, 254 pp.) is a recent, in- teresting title. Kazantzakis was a fervent admirer of Spanish culture. In the course of his lifetime he made three visits to Spain, and in 1957, in the Greek journal Diphros, he recorded the impressions he had received from these voyages, for the purpose of intioducing this outstanding civilization to his Grecian friends. The re- sult is a very fascinating text. It is not a travel-book in the ordinary sense of the word, but a vivid interpretation of the Spaniard through various phases of his history. Kazantzakis was one of the great poets of the twentieth century. As an artist, he stands shoulder to shoulder with the giants of literature-with Cervantes and Dostoev- sky. He has not been given the acclaim that he deserves, but time will take care of this injustice. And with the passage of time, we will have a truer understanding of the brilliancy of modern Greek litera- ture. In the West, the poets and novelists of the Modern Greek Age remain relatively unknown-some of today's great writers have hardly been read or discussed. Only a handful are familiar to any reading audience and only a few have been trans- lated into foreign idiom. Grecian drama, from the time of the Middle Ages remains a riddle and a number of excellent plays remain a mystery. Kazantzakis offers the reader valuable references to the history of ideas and to literature. He is not only a fecund writer, but a rare scholar who combines with all this meticulous attention to detail. His sharpness may be felt, like the beat of a pulse, on every page. He offers a very vivid challenge to the reader. Although we may not agree with many of his personal opinions on Spain (cf. the Spanish Renais- sance) we may agree, however, that these essays that he offers reveal the vitality, power, and philosophy of a very remarkable man. These essays, then, which appear in English for the first time, are the product of a disciplined and noble and cultured mind. Kazantzakis certainly covers a wide range of topics-from El Cid to Santa Teresa, from El Greco to Garcia Lorca. The second portion of the book is dedicated exclusively to his dispatches on the Civil War. This is the most beautiful section of the book. Every admirer of Spanish culture must read these pages, for Kazant- zakis' style is delightful to behold and a pleasure to read. It is important to note that Kazantzakis bears the insights of the humanist at all times, for he was deeply</page><page sequence="4">THE HISPANIC WORLD 151 interested in the conditions and challenges of the ages that man has lived in. Kazantzakis visited Spain during the throes of her disastrous Civil War and the items he sent back to Greece bear the testimony of an articulate authority. He never settled in one city as El Greco or Demetrio Ducas had done previously, but he traveled throughout Spain, conversing with poets and philosophers, artists, soldiers and peasants. His final evaluation of Span- ish culture is designed to present to the reader a picture of a living world and an extraordinary people. It is unlike any other book written on this subject-Kazantzakis depicted what he saw, what he felt-he wrote a brilliant narrative, recounting and analyzing a few of the incredible events that had occurred from the earliest time of Spanish history to the coming of hostili- ties in 1936. These three trips have pro- duced a book that is suffused with a warm appreciation for the land of Don Quijote. Perhaps a few illustrations from the book will convince the reader of the very great, the thoroughly mature and scholarly atti- tudes of Nikos Kazantzakis. Here he speaks of Spain, Don Quijote and Sancho. Where has one read or felt such power of style before? Spain is the Don Quijote of nations. She rises up to save the earth, scorning security and all- being, forever hunting some exotic chimaera; never able to attain it. . . Quijote and Sancho are one. Both of them together form the single unified spirit of Spain. Cervantes divided our spirit into two parts, so that we could see it better . . . Among such rocks as these, in sum- mertime when the winds whistle over the stones, the boundaries of the dream and the truth vacil- late and are lost. The brain seethes and feels con- fused and thinks all things easy for an energetic willing spirit. Our hearts stop. We see him coming out of the back door of the proud beggar's tower and we want to shout to him: "Where are you going, beloved one, with that old moribund horse of yours, and your rusty spear, your lost youth, your money belt empty of gold ducats and not a drop of common sense in you? Come back!" But the fearless simple lover of the Idea and of the heartless Dulcinea was already down in the plain, had already raised his spear. He was all love and wrath. The world had emerged from God's hands, rife with injustice and shortcomings. And he, the Knight of the Ideal, was duty-bound to set it right. For Don Quijote's work begins where God's leaves off. Kazantzakis was deeply influenced by Cervantes' work. He admired the figure of Don Quijote and he dedicated a long Canto to him. Here is a portion of that Canto, elegantly translated by Kimon Friar: The icy stars above you will laugh long, and men below will shout derision at all you do, but you, with a seducing joy, Of most ferocious freedom and of death will sweetly smile, O greatly martyred soul, and leave drops of your rich blood everywhere. You are the youngest, favorite son of God, his dearest treasure and his purest gold, his ultimate bastion: firm, impregnable. But there is one paragraph that stands out above the rest and shows the depth in writing sensitivity of our traveling poet- his skilful energy captures the many moods of Spain and Man: All of a sudden, how I loved all Spain that moonwashed evening. I embraced all her sorrows and hopes and longed to see her salvation. To- night, how clearly and with what horror, I could see the struggle of man over the thin muddy crust of the earth! For a bit of light to shine, the powers of darkness have to clash for centuries. For hope to be born, despair, sorrow, injustice have to be at work for centuries. There is no other way. The good people and the deli- cate abandon the battle in anger and disgust. If these were the creatures of life, they would have cut it along the patterns of philanthropy and their own reason. But life is created by harsh contradictory spirits, steeped in sorrow, patience, obstinacy. And so life radiates the keen smell of tears and sweat and earth. JAMES KLEON DEMETRIUS New York City "Hispanic American Report" suspends publication.-Since its appearance in 1948, Hispanic American Report, a monthly analysis of events in Spain, Portugal and Latin America published at Stanford Uni- versity, has become indispensable to all who are interested in any aspect of the Hispanic world. Readers of this depart- ment will recall the many references to HAR and quotations from its pages which have appeared in our columns. Prof. Ronald Hilton and the enterprising and dedicated members of his Institute of His- panic and Luso-Brazilian Studies richly</page><page sequence="5">152 HISPANIA deserve the gratitude and admiration of Hispanists all over the world for their con- tributions toward building a broad-gauge Hispanism which cuts across the barriers of academic disciplines and attempts to understand the developments of the whole culture of the Hispanic and Luso-Brazilian areas. The suspension of the Report consti- tutes the most serious blow Hispanists have suffered since the end of World War II. Let us hope that Stanford University will reconsider its decision and resume publica- tion of HAR. Prof. Gregory Rabassa of Columbia Univ. in the following excerpts from his letter to The New York Times of Nov. 27, 1964, surely expresses the sentiments of Hispanists everywhere: The Times of Nov. 22 reports the resignation of Prof. Ronald Hilton from his position as director of Stanford University's Institute of Hispanic-American and Luso-Brazilian Studies and as editor of the Hispanic-American Report published by that Institute. This is a serious blow for those of us in the Latin-American field, especially so since the same article says that the Report will suspend publication "pending outcome of a study by an 'appropriate faculty-administration committee.'" This publication is without a doubt the finest compendium of news from the whole Hispanic world, and I for one will be lost without it. I know of no substitute. Now we who are scholars are faced with the loss of time in searching out facts that Dr. Hilton and his staff used to find for us. The article makes note of the angry tone of Hilton's resignation, and perhaps therein lies the cause. Almost everyone in the Hispanic field has had cause to quarrel with Ronald Hilton over this or that idea of his. But he has been a remarkable gadfly in an area of study which is too often famous for acquiescence and "going along" with a banal official position. Two instances in which Dr. Hilton managed to keep his head above apologetics and report the facts as he saw them were the situation in Guatemala and Cuba. Some would say that his position was courageous, but if so, it was simply the courage of objectivity .. Another delightful characteristic of the Report was the style in which it was written. Hilton's trenchant tone seems to have rubbed off on those who worked with him. As a result the journal was one of the most readable serious organs that I have seen. Ronald Hilton is a difficult and combative man, and his resignation does have a Socratic note of cantankerous behavior about it. One is led to surmise that he has forced the college officials to make him drink the hemlock, and this is the measure of the man. Any correspondence on the subject should be addressed to Dean Richard W. Lyman, Humanities and Sciences, Stan- ford Univ., Stanford, Calif. R. G. M. La temporada teatral en Madrid.-A principios de septiembre de 1964 se inici6 la temporada teatral en Madrid con el estreno de Ninette y un sefior de Murcia, bajo la direcci6n del propio Mihura. En esta comedia ir6nica y Ilena de paradojas se puede apreciar un juego de contrastes: un provinciano de Murcia que ha venido a Paris con una idea preconcebida sobre esta capital y con el deseo de verla y divertirse a sus anchas. Se queda, sin em- bargo, encerrado en casa todo el tiempo con una francesita, hija de un exiliado espahiol. Ha encontrado en Paris justa- mente aquello de lo cual huia: Murcia. Ademis, termina regresando a su ciudad natal con su futura esposa y sus suegros (la madre una verdulera y el padre un trabajador socialista). Mihura ha sabido mover muy bien a sus cinco personajes. En esta comedia re- saltan el humor, la saitira, la ironia, las sorpresas, la polemica a la espafiola, las alusiones politicas (los presos, el hambre, la agricultura), la comparaci6n entre la vida en Espana y en Francia. Despues de un primer acto excelente, la obra se alarga innecesariamente en el segundo. Como resultado, los actores ha- blan a veces mis de lo que act-ian. Los interpretes, sin embargo, estuvieron a la altura de la situaci6n, especialmente "el provinciano," interpretado por Juanjo Menendez, quien tambien actu6 mara- villosamente el afio pasado en El lindo Don Diego, de Moreto, y Rafael L. So- moza, el "socialista" Pierre. "La fiebre de junio" de Alfonso Paso.- Durante el calor de junio tuvimos .la opor- tunidad de presenciar el estreno de La fiebre de junio, de Alfonso Paso. En esta comedia, al Ilegar junio (fiebre natural) y "el funerario culto de los examenes" (fiebre antinatural), Ilega tambien la novia del estudiante y con ella el deseo de "fundirse"</page><page sequence="6">THE HISPANIC WORLD 153 con la naturaleza. Noche de junio, citando Paso a T. S. Eliot, "en que cualquier milagro puede realizarse." He aqui el cuadro de la obra: estudiantes picaros o enamoradizos que, o no saben por que estudian y copian exaimenes, o son unos "empollones" dedicadisimos pero bur- ladores al fin; un viejo y mujeriego cate- dritico; una huespeda; una prostituta de buen coraz6n; un cura bonanch6n de viejo cufio y con muy poco conocimiento del mundo y sus problemas sociales; un agente de policia comprensivo y "simpitico" que guarda la moral p6iblica. Dentro de la ficci6n inevitable en una pieza teatral, dice Paso que poco ha inventado aqui: "O lo he visto o lo he vivido." La obra fue aplaudida por cierta parte del puiblico que se queda en Madrid a pesar de la fiebre veraniega. Casona en el Festival de Bellac y en el Teatro Griego barcelondes.-En el Festival de Bellac, consagrado a la memoria de Giraudoux, se estren6 este verano, en pre- sencia del autor, la leyenda dramaitica Ineds de Portugal, de Casona. En afios anteriores Espafia ha participado en el mismo festival con El mddico de su honra, de Calder6n, y con Yerma, de Garcia Lorca. En el Teatro Griego se ha estrenado El caballero de las espuelas de oro, tambidn de Casona e inspirada en la vida de Que- vedo. He aqui una obra que descuella especialmente en su segundo acto. Cierta critica ha reparado, sin embargo, en el "in- necesario desfile de esperpentos al finalizar el primer acto." Al hablar del interds por el genio con- ceptista, conviene mencionar la primera adaptaci6n teatral que en la historia de la literatura se ha hecho de la obra de Que- vedo Los picaros, escrita por Rafael Nar- bona, y la nueva edici6n de las Obras com- pletas de Quevedo, dirigida por Jose Ma- nuel Blecua, Martin Riquer y Jose Maria Valverde. Sin embargo, la estatua de don Francisco, mudada de la calle madrilefia en que se encontraba, sigue encarcelada en "el almacen de los objetos perdidos," con la esperanza de ver la luz alguin dia. Sturgis E. Leavitt, "Alcalde de Zalamea." -In recent months a rare distinction was conferred upon our esteemed colleague in Spain. The following article, reprinted from the Chapel Hill, N.C., Weekly, tells the story: Note: Back in 1959, the Weekly carried a story on Dr. Sturgis E. Leavitt, retired Kenan professor of Spanish at the University, receiving the rare honor of being chosen honorary mayor of Zalamea de la Serena, a historic town in southwestern Spain. It was not until this fall, however, that Dr. Leavitt was able to go to Zalamea and receive his honor. As the following article by Dr. Leavitt discloses, it was a gay welcome indeed when Zalamea rolled out the red carpet for its honorary mayor from Chapel Hill. By STURGIS E. LEAVITT Zalamea de la Serena goes back to Roman times, three centuries or more before Christ. Some people believe that it was founded by the Greeks before that. It has a pair of Roman towers, unlike any others in Spain. One of the important battles of the First Punic War was fought nearby. It has a Moorish castle that was captured by the Christians in 1188. Zalamea was made famous in the world of letters by one of the most notable of Spanish plays, "The Mayor of Zalamea," by Calderon de la Barca. And yet, this interesting city of some 9,000 inhabitants in the Province of Badajoz in South- western Spain (Extremadura) is seldom, if ever, visited by tourists. Why? It is not on any rail- road line, nor on any main highway. You can't find it on the map, unless the map is a big one, and you have a magnifying glass to make out the fine lettering. But the city is there, all right, as this article can testify. But first, a little background. Back in 1959 the students in my class became enthusiastic over an interpretation of Calderon's play, and they wrote to the Mayor of Zalamea. The letter must have been pretty well written, for the City Council (Ayuntamiento), in full sessions, elected me-this is hard to believe-Perpetual Honorary Mayor. In due time a beautiful hand- lettered parchment was received making known the election, and with it the staff of office (vara) of the mayor himself. The election could not have been more official. It was not possible to go to Zalamea and "take office" until this year. The proper time for the Honorary Mayor to make this appearance, so the real Mayor said, was from September 13 to September 21, when fiestas and ferias would be held. These date back over three hundred and fifty years. Getting there would have been something of a problem, had it not been for my colleague, Bill McKnight, who had been traveling all over Spain in a sort of bus, known by the familiar name of Volkswagen. By the time of our de-</page><page sequence="7">154 HISPANIA parture from Madrid, his family had gone back to North Carolina, and he acted as guide, chauf- feur, adviser, and astronomical navigator over what is perhaps the greatest variety of roads known to man. We stopped for the night at a little town called Don Benito, where we received cordial greeting from the Mayor, who had been in- formed of our arrival by the Mayor of Zalamea, Don Nicasio Fernandez-Blanco. We had been instructed to meet Don Nicasio at a crossroad five kilometers from Zalamea. Since we did not know how long it would take, over uncertain roads, we made an early start and arrived a half hour early. We had hardly alighted when Don Nicasio and his cousin, Don Anselmo Fernandez-Blanco, arrived. Don Anselmo had been Mayor of Zalamea when the election of the Honorary Mayor took place. Cordial greetings and abrazos (embraces). We told Don Nicasio that it had been our intention to come in two Cadillacs, so as to make the proper impression, but that unfortunately, the Cadillacs had not arrived from the factory. Consequently, so we said, we were forced to come in a "truck." This joke, bad as it was, broke the ice. There wasn't much ice at this steaming point in the road on one of the hottest days of the year. And in the Province of Badajoz in Extremadura, the land of the conquistadores, the temperature really goes up in summer. The Honorary Mayor was invested with the Key to the City, which hung around his neck with a golden tasseled cord. Don Nicasio had brought his own staff of office for me to carry, but I explained that I already had one, that I had brought mine all the way from Chapel Hill. This was the Real McCoy, because now the Mayor and the Honorary Mayor could each appear officially and with the proper dignity. When the procession of two cars arrived at the principal square, appropriately named for Calderon de la Barca, the townspeople were waiting for us by the City Hall, with big banners saying BIENVENIDO (Welcome), held up by young enthusiasts. Prolonged clap- ping of hands, and shouts of Vitor (Victor). We made our way through the crowd with no little difficulty into the Session Hall, which filled up right away, with people standing wherever they could. The Honorary Mayor's place on the platform was an ancient oak and leather chair, between the Mayor and the parish priest. Mayors from adjoining towns sat at the side, or in front. When some semblance of order prevailed, the real Mayor rose to speak (applause), then he presented the Honorary Mayor (more applause), then the Honorary Mayor spoke, greatly moved by so much atten- tion (still more applause). The session closed with the presentation of a recording of the play, "The Mayor of Zalamea," and a beautiful leather case, with the history of the town and pictures, inscribed "Al Ilustrisimo Senor Don Sturgis E. Leavitt Alcalde Perpetuo Honorio de Zalamea de la Serena (Badajoz), 1964." After this was over, we made our way down the aisle, shaking hands all along the way. The next act was a vino, where the Honorary Mayor sat between Don Nicasio and the priest. In front of us was a table loaded with refreshments- cakes, ham, cheese, sausages, nuts, and drinks of all kinds. As we ate, groups of boys and girls, dressed in sixteenth-century costumes, serenaded us with traditional music. All the time, more refresh- ments, literally forced upon the two guests. It was hard to keep count. Then, flash bulbs and pictures, with the two Americans surrounded by pretty girls. After this, more shaking hands, and out to the square for fireworks and dancing. It was reported in the paper that the Honorary Mayor "honored" the city by dancing with the girls. It was the other way around. We left the dancing in full swing, early, that is, at 11:30, and proceeded up the street with the Mayor and his friends, shaking hands all the way, and escorted by members of the police force. Dinner at a magnificent private home lasted until 1:30. The next morning the Honorary Mayor at- tended a special religious service and sat with the Mayor at a place of honor beside the high altar. Then came a tour of the city, an elaborate lunch at another private home, visit to a nearby irrigation project, and housing development. Then a dinner, before which the Honorary Mayor made a speech to the fifteen guests pres- ent, and presented the real Mayor with a gavel made from the Davie Poplar and a scroll with greetings to the City Council from Chancellor Aycock and President Friday. More attentions followed on the next day, and finally many fond good-byes. Don Nicasio accompanied us to the Provincial Capital Bada- joz, where he introduced us to the Governor and other high officials. Don Nicasio had to stay at Badajoz for a meeting of alcaldes of the province, and we went back to the hotel to pay our bill. Just as had happened in Zalamea when we tried to pay for anything, the clerk refused to take our money. The bill had already been paid. Needless to say, Zalamea de la Serena will not be forgotten by the two Chapel Hillians who were there in 1964. Maybe, though, this did not happen after all. It must have been a dream. R. G. M.

EDWARD NAGY Best Latin American Novel (1947-1962). -"Famed writer and historian Ram6n Diaz Sainchez has been awarded the Faulkner Prize, established by the William Faulkner Foundation, for his book Cumboto, as the best Latin American novel published be- tween 1947 and 1962. This is the first time the Faulkner Prize is bestowed, consisting of a metal plaque with the text of the jury's resolution engraved on it. The book will be translated into English" (Vene- zuela Up-to-date, Fall, 1964). North American and Latin American conceptions of "race."-In John P. Gillin's essay "Some Signposts for Policy," which appears in the volume Social Change in Latin America Today: Its Implications for United States Policy by L. Bryson et al, a publication of the Council on Foreign Re- lations, the difference between the North American and the Latin American concep- tions of "race" is clearly brought out. Pro- fessor Gillin writes: The custom, in Spanish, of speaking of the Indians in terms of race (raza) is confusing to North Americans. In Spanish-American countries Indians are regarded as a separate race, not be- cause of any distinguishable physical charac- teristics, but because they have a different cul- ture and social status as compared with recog- nized or Europeanized members of the national society. In most countries many prominent people are as 'Indian' in their inherited physical traits as any recognized tribal member. Conversely, any member of an Indian tribe or community may be accepted into the national society, usually on the basis of three accomplishments. He must learn to speak the national language, Spanish or Portuguese, fluently. He must adopt European- type clothing. And he must move away from a recognized Indian tribe or community and settle in a city, town, or village considered to be na- tional-i.e., Spanish or Portuguese-in its culture. Because the Latin American definition of race" is based on cultural traits rather than physical differences, Negroids, generally speak- ing, have been assimilated into the national societies. Otherwise, race in the physical sense is of little social or cultural significance. To be sure, a few families in the "Indian countries" claim to be "pure" white descendants of the Conquistadores, but their pretensions are usually considered something of a joke, even by their social peers. In all Latin American countries one can point to persons of mixed racial inheritance who hold prominent positions in politics and economic life, although they are proportionately less numerous in the countries of predominantly European settlement. Racial purity in the genetic sense is not an important value in present-day Latin America as a whole. Univ. of Wisconsin NORMAN P. SACKS The self-fulfilling prophecy and the His- panic world.-Students of the Spanish Civil War, of the Franco regime, and of United States-Cuban relations since the Cuban Revolution began, may find the following exposition of "The self-fulfilling prophecy" of interest. It comes from the book Social Theory and Social Structure by Robert K. Merton, the well known pro- fessor of sociology at Columbia University. The "Thomas theorem" referred to is the following observation by the American sociologist, W. I. Thomas: "If men define situations as real, they are real in their con- sequences." Professor Merton notes that the truth and pertinence of this theorem have been agreed upon by such diverse people as Bishop Bossuet in the seventeenth century, Mandeville in the eighteenth century, Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, and William Graham Sumner, whose Folkways has been an American sociological classic.</page><page sequence="9">156 HISPANIA The quotation from the Merton volume concerning "the self-fulfilling prophecy" runs as follows: ... men respond [referring to the "Thomas theorem"] not only to the objective features of a situation, but also, and at times primarily, to the meaning this situation has for them. And once they have assigned some meaning to the situation, their consequent behavior and some of the consequences of that behavior are deter- mined by the ascribed meaning. . . it is believed that war between two nations is inevitable. Actuated by this conviction, repre- sentatives of the two nations become progressive- ly alienated, apprehensively countering each "offensive" move of the other with a "defensive" move of their own. Stockpiles of armaments, raw materials and armed men grow larger and eventually the anticipation of war helps create the actuality. The self-fulfilling prophecy is, in the begin- ning a false definition of the situation evoking a new behavior which makes the originally false conception come true. The specious validity of the self-fulfilling prophecy perpetuates a reign of error. For the prophet will cite the actual course of events as proof that he was right from the very beginning . . . The application of the Thomas theorem also suggests how the tragic, often vicious, circle of self-fulfilling prophecies can be broken. The initial definition of the situation which set the circle in motion must be abandoned. Only when the original assumption is questioned and a new definition of the situation introduced, does the consequent flow of events give lie to the assump- tion. Only then does the belief no longer father the reality. Univ. of Wisconsin NORMAN P. SACKS Obstacles to the improvement of public education in Latin America.-In the revised edition of his book, Latin America: A De- scriptive Survey, William Lytle Schurz summarizes some of the principal obstacles and difficulties confronting the public edu- cational movement in Latin America in the following words: The principal problem in connection with the public educational movement is a financial one. The taxation and budget systems are generally rudimentary and antiquated, the opposition of the moneyed classes to new levies very strong, and the taxable resources of many countries definitely limited. Moreover, the ratio of chil- dren of school age to taxpayers is excessively high. Financing of public enterprises by means of internal loans is not developed to the same degree as in the United States. The result has been that the ambitious programs adopted have sometimes proven beyond the capacity of govern- ments to carry them out on schedule, so that readjustments in the timing of the plans have had to be made. Costa Rica devotes a larger share of its na- tional budget to education than any other coun- try. Mexico spends about twice as much for its schools as for the defense establishment, and expenditures by state and local governments in- creases the proportion. Brazil's federal govern- ment spends only half as much for education and public welfare combined as it does for the military, while state and municipal governments generally do too little to meet the costs of public education. On the other hand, Chile's outlay for schools is higher than for defense, but in other west-coast countries the reverse is true. In back- ward Ecuador military expenditures are half again those of its schools, and in Peru, where elementary education levels outside Lima are low, the army and air force receive 30 percent more of the national budget than do the country's schools. Haiti, with one of the two smallest budgets in Latin America, allocates over 40 percent more of public funds to the armed forces than it does to much-needed schools. Military and public works expenditures have generally had precedence over the needs of other branches of government, so that, when retrenchment is necessary, school budgets are liable to be cur- tailed. Another obstacle to the educational programs is the opposition of certain conservative or re- actionary elements to anything more than a mini- mum of primary schooling for the mass of the population. Some even consider the popular ability to read as an impediment to the main- tenance of a sound economic and social system. Univ. of Wisconsin NORMAN P. SACKS Knopf plans to publish Latin American books.-"While a good many American publishers were tumbling over one another at the Frankfurt Book Fair, trying to pick up what they might, Alfred A. Knopf sat serenely in his Madison Avenue office. This one had just come back from beating the bushes of Brazil, the most recent scout- ing expedition to Latin America in a series dating back to 1942, when Mrs. Blanche Knopf first opened up the territory for the firm. "Mr. Knopf was casual-'We just saw a few old friends; a few days here, a few days there.' The amenities with friends aside, there came back plans for local publication of additional Latin American books. There will be a reissue of Jorge Amado's The Violent Land next year, and the year following, the publication of Amado's latest book, Os Pastores da Noite</page><page sequence="10">THE HisPANIc WORLD 157 (Shepherds of the Night.) With a tribute paid to a nice situation by publishers the world over, Mr. Knopf noted that the Brazilian publisher of this one printed 50,000 copies, sold 40,000 before publica- tion. There also will be local publication of the five 'sugar-cane' novels by the late Jose Lins do Rego; a novel by Clarice Lispector, new to the Knopf list; Sagarana, stories by Joao Guimaraes Rosa (all Brazil); A Cul- tural History of Latin America, by German Arciniegas (Colombia); Fiesta in Novem- ber, by Eduardo Mallea, an Argentinian. With a list of Latin American books either in print or coming, taking up a full page of typewriter script, Mr. Knopf found the re- lationship between the firm and south-of- the-border 'normal.' "Incidentally, next year marks the 50th anniversary of the founding of the firm. Something will be done to celebrate this, but everyone has been too busy to deter- mine just what. Founding month was October, 1915, the first book was Four Plays By Emile Augier. In answer to a suggestion that he probably didn't get rich on that one, Mr. Knopf noted that the first earnings began six months later, with a reissue of W. H. Hudson's 20-year-old Green Mansions" (New York Times Book Review, Oct. 11, 1964). R. G. M. Spanish and American cross-cultural con- flict.-Edward T. Hall, in his book, The Silent Language, provides an interesting example of how a difference in the in- formal attitudes of two different cultures toward a formal cultural feature may have "ludicrously tragic" results. In relating a cross-cultural conflict which occurred in the West many years ago, Prof. Hall writes: The two cultures involved were the Spanish and the American; at the heart of the prolonged crisis was the differing view which each group takes of law, government, and family. The Latin-American Spanish have developed the institution of the family to a size, stability, and influence that are incredible to us. Their govern- ments on the other hand do not occupy such an important position in the scheme of things as does ours. If something should happen or if something is wanted in a Latin-American coun- try, families are apt to be better at handling the affair than the government, This informal tradi- tion is associated with a different concept of law from our own. Law in Latin America is enforced technically (by the book), but it is mediated by family relationships. With us law courts, and particularly enforcement officers, are not supposed to be harsh and should be guided by the formal systems of the culture. That is, the law is never expected to be stricter than the rest of the culture. If it works undue hardships on people, then it has to be changed. When the American comes across a law which he considers to be unjust or which doesn't make sense, he is much more likely to violate it than if he considers it realistic and sensible. The point at which the Spanish and Ameri- can patterns collided in the western town was over the enforcement of the speed limit. For many years the town-predominantly Spanish in population and government-had a motorcycle policeman named Sancho, of Spanish cultural descent. His job was to enforce the speed limit of 15 mph which extended to the outskirts and included a stretch of two national highways. So assiduous was Sancho in his work that he was famous to all the townspeople as well as to the americanos who lived in the surrounding com- munities. Acting on the letter of the law, he would arrest people going 16 mph-an offense which was punishable by a fine of $12.75, a considerable sum of money during the depression years of the thirties. The Spanish-Americans brought before the court usually had a cousin or an uncle sitting on the bench and were quickly acquitted. The americanos, who were rarely that lucky, became increasingly furious at the situation. Finally they began plotting against Sancho. Once he was led out of town at 60 mph and then run off the road. His legs were so badly broken that he could no longer ride a motorcycle. When he emerged from the hospital he bought a fast roadster and went back to work. But from then on for the next ten or fifteen years life for Sancho became a series of "accidents." He no longer trusted anyone and arrested speeders with a drawn pistol. Even this did not prevent him from being severely beaten up from time to time by the Americans who resented being arrested for doing 16 mph and who had to pay their fines. What the Americans did not understand- and for this they may easily be forgiven-is that the two cultures treat the same point of behavior quite differently and structure the informal into different parts of their respective systems. Tech- nically, to the Spanish, the law was the law and 16 mph was an infraction of the law. Only after they were arrested did they invoke the informal by turning to that system of relatives which is equipped to deal with a weak govern- ment. Americans, on the other hand, allow them- selves a certain amount of informal leeway in their interpretation of what constitutes a viola- tion, but they tend to get tough (and technical) once the machinery of the law is set in motion.</page><page sequence="11">158 HISPANIA The idea of holding people precisely to 15 mph violates both our attitudes toward laws (they should make sense) and our sense of informal leeway. Sancho's trouble was that he never had a model to show him how to deal with ameri- canos. On the whole, Americans have developed no system for making the law easy to live with, as have the Latin Americans. Our own formal system says that it is reprehensible to use influence and doubly so for public officials to show favoritism. We allow very little leeway here, on the grounds that unless a person is either foolish or guilty he would not have run afoul of the law in the first place. Laws may be broken in the United States, but there is a great reluctance to tamper with the legal machinery once it has got under way. As products of American culture we tend to have a difficult time overseas when the laws lack informal lee- way in their enforcement. We see no alternative ways of making them livable. We find it hard to discover those points where there is leeway and, when we do, we are hesitant in using what we find out because it violates our own formal systems. What Americans really like and usually hold out for is for others to change their systems so that it "makes sense" like ours. Univ. of Wisconsin NORMAN P. SACKS Inter-American Academy.-The Inter- American Academy has moved its head- quarters from University of Florida at Gainesville to the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida. With the transfer, effective July 1, Dr. Ione S. Wright, be- came editor of The Journal of Inter-Ameri- can Studies, with Dr. A. Curtis Wilgus, one of its founders and director of the Uni- versity of Florida's annual Caribbean Con- ference, becoming chairman of the editorial board. The journal, in its sixth year, will be published jointly by the University of Miami Press and the Pan American Foun- dation. Dr. Germian Arciniegas, Colombian historian, author, and diplomat, is Presi- dent of the Academy. R. G. M. "Coffee and the Alliance.-The inordi- nately long delay in winning Congressional approval for American participation in the International Coffee Agreement is giving rise to disquieting suspicions throughout Latin America. Our neighbors wonder why no one is fighting harder for the agree- ment, which was inspired by Washington and which means so much to so many of them. Some are even beginning to ques- tion whether the United States can be counted on to continue its firm support of the Alliance for Progress when there is such hesitancy over fulfilling a commit- ment to give the coffee agreement a fair and thorough trial. "It is easy to dismiss these fears as exag- gerated and to place all the blame for American procrastination on a balky and overworked Congress. But the Administra- tion's silence is disturbing. The coffee agreement will break down unless the United States, the world's largest con- sumer, agrees to take part in this experi- ment. "The Administration does not seem to realize what is at stake. Its attitude has cooled because of the rise in coffee prices since the agreement was established. Yet failure to ratify the agreement is largely responsible, as the Brazilians charge, for the uncertainty that has influenced coffee prices. The Administration has the power to persuade all but the most recalcitrant in Congress to take affirmative action that will honor its pledge. Its bill contains adequate safeguards, including the right of with- drawal in case the agreement does not work. The risk is not in approving the accord but in giving half-hearted support that will encourage delay and keep the agreement from becoming operative. It is the one way best calculated to endanger the Alliance by discouraging trust in the United States" (Editorial in The New York Times, Sept. 14, 1964). R. G. M. The Problem of Understanding is Inter- American.-"The Problem of Inter-Ameri- can Understanding," which appeared on pp. 387-388 of the May 1964 issue of His- pania, touched upon a common theme among those interested in Latin America; namely, that North Americans are woe- fully ignorant about their neighbors to the south. This has been demonstrated often enough in recent decades as the need to be more intelligently informed has been made more and more apparent. On the other hand, the responsibility for under-</page><page sequence="12">THE HISPANIC WORLD 159 standing must be truly "inter-American." The Latin Americans also need to make more efforts at understanding the United States. Milton Eisenhower states realistically: "I have long insisted that the greatest im- pediment to fruitful cooperation among the American Republics is lack of mutual understanding . . ." (John C. Dreier, Ed., The Alliance for Progress, Johns Hopkins Press, 1962, p. 1). Lincoln Gordon indi- cates that unless the goals of the Alliance for Progress "become a major part of the national life of each participating country," the program is doomed to failure (Lincoln Gordon, The Alliance for Progress, Harv- ard University Press, 1963). And John Useem makes a cogent point relating to cross cultural understanding that needs to be considered as we discuss inter-American understanding: "Perhaps it would not be unreasonable to observe that both parties are anxious to be understood and that cur- rently both may be more eager to be under- stood than to understand" ("Images of the United States and Britain by Foreign Edu- cated Indians," Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Vol. 295, September, 1954, p. 82). Is the United States understood in the Latin American countries? Norman Hum- phreys relates that "educated persons who have not gone to the United States often view Americans as crass materialists . . . The United States with its vast technology and power, is to many of them a Roman Empire on the edge of catastrophe . . . Their conception of American power, especially the power to intervene actively in the civil affairs of Mexico, is much greater than any contemplated by Ameri- cans themselves" ("The Mexican Image of America," Annals, vol. 295, Sept. 1954, pp. 116-117). Frank Tannenbaum, in his Ten Keys to Latin America (Knopf, 1963), calls atten- tion to the mutual responsibility as he dis- cusses "the failure of communication be- tween us" (p. 196). He comments further that the Latin Americans continue to remember "the big stick of Theodore Roosevelt and the many interventions in the Caribbean and Central America. They continue to picture the United States as a nation of big trusts controlling our government. They continue to describe us as a 'capitalist' nation where individualism is rampant, where there is no social con- science, where labor has no rights and where 'materialism' has crowded all hu- manistic and cultural influence off the stage . . . Unfortunately, Latin Americans have not sensed the profound social revolu- tion that has taken place in the United States since the twenties. They have no understanding of our egalitarian society, or the fact that we have developed a broad system of economic security and still re- tained our political freedom. They have not learned of the federal and state policies that seek to defend individuals against the inherent indifference of large organiza- tions" (pp. 196-198). If this is true, then efforts must be made on the other side of the border. Are nega- tive treatments of the United States or treatments lacking in understanding being expressed in the schools of Latin America? In answer to a UNESCO questionnaire on textbooks, the Mexican Department of Education indicated that it does "every- thing necessary to eliminate from textbooks any passage capable of causing harm to international good feeling" (Primary School Textbooks-Preparation, Selection, Use, A UNESCO Publication, Geneva, International Conference on Primary Edu- cation, 1959). From a study that I made of Mexican school textbooks, it would seem that another reply was needed. This is not to say that the Mexican ministry was untruthful. Perceptions are obviously different and interpretations of historical incidents, for example, are viewed within certain frames of reference, regardless of the efforts at "true" objectivity. Not only did the Mexican textbooks fail to reflect understanding, but the text- books used in Argentina (another part of the above noted study), though less ob- jectionable, could hardly be called tools for bringing "better" understanding of the United States. UNESCO, recognizing these kinds of</page><page sequence="13">160 HISPANIA problems in education has called for the establishment of joint commissions for text- book improvement. In 1954, in response, the "Comisi6n de Historia del Instituto Panamericano de Geografia" recommended that a "Mexican-United States Joint Com- mittee for the Improvement of Textbooks" be established. Dr. Lewis Hanke was to be chairman of the United States com- mittee and Lic. Daniel Cosio Villegas, of the Mexican committee. The American committee, certainly through no fault of Dr. Hanke, did not get off the ground; the Mexican committee, though far more active than the American committee, pub- lished no reports and is at the moment inactive. (Though Lic. Ernesto de la Torre Villar, Secretario Asistente, Comision de Historia, indicated in a letter that: "Nue- stro proplxsito es volver a revitalizar ese Comite y realizar en el futuro una labor de la mas alta importancia.") Ramon Ruiz r e p o r t s ("Indifference South of the Border-Why Latin Ameri- cans Ignore Our History," Southwest Re- view, Winter, 1958) that United States History and related topics are avoided in Mexican universities which helps complete a not too bright picture of the educational attempts at understanding. In the communications media, John C. Merrill (Gringo, The American as Seen by Mexican Journalists, U. of Florida Press, Latin American Monograph Series, #23) gives us a similar picture. Mexican journalists believed that the press gave a "realistic and objective image of the United States. They felt that Mexico was particu- larly ignored, however, in the press of the United States and that the picture of Mexico presented to American readers was warped and unreal" (p. 47). Mr. Merrill's conclusions were quite to the contrary. He described the Mexican press image as an- tagonistic. There are obviously difficulties at arriv- ing at understanding between countries and regions that have cultural differences. This, however, does not relieve nations of making the necessary attempts at over- coming the obstacles. We in the United States can make the greatest adjustments and possibly we should, but our Latin American neighbors also need to make efforts. The desire for understanding has to be a mutual desire; it has to be truly "inter-American." Northern Michigan Univ. VITO PERRONE "The Alliance: Next Step.-Things are looking up for the Alliance for Progress as it enters its fourth year. Better prices for raw materials have added to the foreign exchange earnings of most Latin-American countries. More intensive efforts are being made to curb inflation, which frequently has warped and distorted economic develop- ment. "The Alliance is still groping, but its survival is assured because its members are no longer under the illusion that they can transform the continent overnight. Indeed, they have learned the hard way that social reforms are best carried out from sound economic foundations. "When the Alliance first began, the emphasis was on government-to-govern- ment aid. This was because governments have to take the initiative in implementing change and because the deterioration in the terms of trade required massive doses of emergency aid from Washington. But the Alliance charter made clear that the major part of the funds for development must come from Latin America itself, par- ticularly from the private sector. "In slowing down inflation and setting up more realistic goals, the members of the Alliance are inviting a greater contribution by private capital, domestic and foreign. Foreign investors are ready to respond, but only if the business communities of Latin America shed some of their monopolistic and nationalist traditions that have stifled competition and have limited progress. "This, then, is the essential next step for the Alliance, one that will enable it to make a big leap forward. There is still a need for government help, especially to countries that are making earnest efforts to strengthen their economies. But there is an even greater need for private capital, which is essential for building a sound economic basis from which to carry out social re- forms. The job cannot be done by govern-</page><page sequence="14">THE HisPANIC WORLD 161 ments alone. It calls for a more open and flexible attitude on the part of Latin- American businessmen" (New York Times, Dec. 10, 1964). R. G. M. Fondo's 30th Anniversary.- 1964 marked the 30th anniversary of the founding of Mexico's outstanding publishing house, the Fondo de Cultura Econ6mica, well-known to readers of this department. The growth and success over the past three decades of the FCE, today the most dynamic and promising publishers in the Hispanic world, are a sort of cultural index of Mexi- co's development, and augur well for the future. The anniversary was observed wide- ly in the fall, with lectures, expositions, and banquets, as well as extensive publi- city in newspapers and journals in Mexico, in Spain, and all over Latin America. In the month of September alone, the Fondo issued 30 new titles in a dozen fields and, on the fourth of the month put into circu- lation its Catcilogo General. The latter is impressive evidence of FCE growth: al- most 700 pages, 100 illustrations, and cross- indexed with references to authors, titles, subject fields, and collections. There is also a Nota Preliminar which supplies the historical background of the Fondo's growth. U.S. university libraries are pur- chasing ever larger numbers of FCE books, and its catalog is strongly recommended to language and literature departments, as well as those in geography, economics, history and political science in institutions which are seeking to strengthen their Latin American library holdings. R. G. M. Mexican railroads.-John H. McNeely's The .Railways of Mexico: A Study in Nationalization (El Paso: Texas Western College Press, 1964. 56 pp.), makes two principal contributions. Perhaps the most significant one is bibliographical-the com- pilation and presentation in the footnotes of an impressive number of books, pamph- lets, and documents relating to Mexican railroads. (Unfortunately, there is no sepa- rate bibliography.) Students of Mexican history are not likely to find as many titles pertaining to Mexican railway policy and development in any other publication. The author makes a second contribution in presenting an outline of the growth of the Mexican railroad system. Although details are lacking in such a short study, the basic facts concerning the promotion and construction of all of Mexico's sepa- rate railroad lines are conveniently made available in this one booklet, along with additional information concerning the poli- cies of certain Mexican presidents and rail- road administrators regarding the consoli- dation of the Mexican railroad system, the participation of foreign capital, and the like. Such skeletal data, however welcome, does not appear to justify the author's claim to study nationalization, as suggested by the sub-title. In the view of the author three persons loom largest in Mexican railway history- Carlos Pacheco, Jose Ives Limantour, and Lazaro Cirdenas, the first for his role in granting concessions to foreigners as minis- ter of development from 1881 to 1891, the second for his insistence on government ownership of foreign-built lines during the Porfirio Diiz administration. Cirdenas' importance is apparently in both a positive and negative sense, for he not only en- couraged the rapid construction of branch lines but he also sponsored a "ruinous" arrangement of worker control over rail- road administration. Univ. of Kansas CHARLES L. STANSIFER Literature in Castro's Cuba.-Joel Agee, a recent visitor to Cuba, contributes one man's view of the literary and publishing situation there to Books (New York), Sept. 1964: Unlike many of their colleagues in other socialist countries, Cuban writers have every reason to consider themselves benefitted by the Revolution. For the first time in Cuba, their books are being published in large editions, assiduously distributed across the island, and even read. Their livelihood is assured them, if not in all cases through their books alone, still through employment in the Writers' Union or in one of the various cultural institutions. As a result of the extraordinary revolution in education Cuba has gone through, these writers have found an actual and potential readership which, with exceptions like Nicolis Guillen and</page><page sequence="15">162 HISPANIA Alejo Carpentier, they would not have hoped for six years ago. Confident that whatever cul- tural gap still exists between themselves and their readers will be closed well within their lifetime, they feel no compunction to inhibit their stylistic idiosyncrasies in favor of a more "popular" style. When asked what is the great- est problem, the severest difficulty they must cope with, most writers will answer: "Lack of time." The editions of the publishing house Casa de las Americas, which also puts out an excellent literary monthly, have a minimum of 5000 copies; the Writers' Union is the country's sec- ond most important publishing house. Ediciones el Puente is dedicated to the publishing of young and unknown authors; the editions are usually smaller than the above mentioned, but in an average bookstore one will find at least 15 or 20 books published by this company. This means that even the most obscure writer, if he shows a modicum of talent, has a substantial opportunity of getting his books published and widely dis- tributed. Intense Cultural Atmosphere Apart from this, the non-financial orientation of the publishing houses contributes to a con- stant heightening of the cultural level among "uneducated" people, as well as to the main- tenance of a fairly intense cultural atmosphere. There are no restrictions on style; the word "decadent" is not bandied around excessively, and any subject matter is respected. Needless to say, no counter-revolutionary tract could be pub- lished in Cuba; but it should also be borne in mind that the publishing houses are headed neither by bureaucrats nor by businessmen, that the Writers' Union for one is headed solely by writers, and that whatever restrictions are im- posed come from the judgment of the writers themselves, not from a "higher" source. Of foreign writers, among the best known are Pablo Neruda, Jean-Paul Sartre, Ernest Hem- ingway, C6sar Vallejo, Edward Albee (whose "Zoo Story" and "The Death of Bessie Smith" were produced while we were in Cuba). Edgar Allan Poe, I was told, was the most widely read author last year. The major novels of Faulkner can be found on the shelves of the larger bookstores in cities like Havana, Santa Clara and Santiago. At the Casa de las Americas I was informed that the publication of Joyce's "Ulysses" and Proust's "Remembrance of Things Past" was impending, along with the most complete collection of Kafka in Latin America. Literature of the Absurd While the books of Joyce, Proust and Kafka are not yet to be had in Cuban bookstores, their influence is visible in much of the new Cuban writing. C6sar L6pez' collection of stories, "Circulando el Cuadro," published by Ediciones Revoluci6n, leans heavily on the style of Jean Cau, a protagonist of what one could looxsely call "literature of the absurd," while attempting to reflect the reality of the revolution. Although it is not literature of the highest order, this book is representative of the attempt made by many young Cuban novelists to assimilate the Revolu- tion-seen as an enormous instant of social progress rather than an external catastrophe, a Dark Storm-with the most advanced literary means. (I would say that in general, Cuban writers are stylistically more advanced and more ambi- tious than American writers, also perhaps more interested in keeping up with the latest stylistic innovations in France; this not in the sense that there is a cult of fashionable writing, but merely that writers take pride in and exercise their artistic freedom instead of abstractly venerating it.) 'A Little Hermneticist' Louis Marre, whom we met at an informal gathering with ten novelists and poets, and who was introduced to us half-jokingly as "a little hermeticist, that one," was recently published by Ediciones Revolucion. His poetry does not betray much social consciousness; the poems are truly hermetic, his chosen ancestors being Rimbaud, Nerval, the early Neruda. There are exceptional pieces in the book, particularly some brief prose poems which again are reminiscent of what I called "literature of the absurd," this time of Henri Michaux. But M\Iarre's writing is distinctly original-not Arctic, as Michaux, but Cuban-even his her- meticist exercises contain an element of hope. One of us asked Marre how he could recon- cile his support of the Revolution with the rela- tive "incomprehensibility" of his writing. Marre told us that he had for a long time been a textile worker before becoming a writer, and that his poems still appear, not only in the handsome and large Ediciones Revoluci6n, but on the bulletin board of the factory where he used to work and which he still visits. He swears that his poems are understood there, and liked. Large Supply of Poetry If there is always a tremendous supply of the pamphlets put out by Editora Politica, there is an equal or larger supply of poetry in almost every bookstore (one-third of all Cuban publica- tions, I was told by the writers at the Union, is poetry). Edici6n Tertulia, headed by Fayad Jamis, one of the more prominent young Cuban writers, publishes poets from Manuel Hernandez to T. S. Eliot in small pocket editions. Ediciones el Puente, with its monthly renewed batch of new Cuban poets, appears to be ubiquitous, and most other publishing houses have a large per- centage of poetry. The Consejo Nacional de Cultura publishes very inexpensive editions of classics, including anthologies of Rub6n Dario and Cesar Vallejo.</page><page sequence="16">THE HismANic WORLD 163 In most larger bookstores one will find collec- tions of plays by Brecht and Lorca, a long line of Russian novels from Tolstoy and Dos- toyevsky to Fedin and Scholochov and-the latest import from Spain-dozens of yellow paperbacks containing the collected works of Ortega y Gas- set. One gets the distinct impression that, what- ever the absences are, they are not the result of a policy decision: There has simply not been enough time to publish all there is to publish. Another factor is the blockade; both the writers and the general reading public feel deeply affected by the solid barrier erected against the import of American art and literature. While Albee was published, produced, and reviewed in Cuba, no similar attempt can be detected in the United States to continue the cultural exchange between the two countries, which, the Cuban writers said, was the only exchange Cuba ever profited from. R. G. M. "Aqui Poesia."-This lively poetry re- view, founded in 1963, is edited and pub- lished in Montevideo by Rub6n Yacovski. Number 16 (August, 1964) opens with a dedicatory original drawing and four poems by Pablo Neruda. Another notable poet included is the Nicaraguan, Ernesto Car- dinal. Five Uruguayans (Ana Victoria Mondada, Mercedes Rein, Selva Casal, Leonardo Milla and Alberto Mediza), two Argentineans (Marta Lynch and Luisa Pasamanik) and-in translation-five Bul- garians (Jristo Botev, Jristo Smirnenski, Nicolas Vaptsarov, Stanka Pencheva and Blaga Dimitrova) are also represented. The editor may be reached at Veracierto 1870, Apartado 6, Montevideo, Uruguay. Univ. of Arizona CHARLES A. KING "Alcor."-Number 31 (August, 1964) of Alcor contains a variety of interesting items. Of special literary and linguistic interest are: "La paradoja de lo literario en Del- mira Agustini" by Amanda Berenguer, an interview with Marta Lynch (a young prize winning Argentine novelist) by Mi- guel Angel Fernandez, and "Pora" ( a discussion of the Guarani word) by Gus- tavo Gonzalez. Included also are poems by Jorge Medina Vidal, Roberto Juarroz, An- tonio Cubillas and Ovidio Benitez Pereira. Univ. of Arizona CHARLES A. KING "Americas" continues its presentation of current trends in Latin American poetry.- In its Nov. 1963 number, with "Cinco poetas mexicanos" by Sergio Mondragon, Amdricas began to present-by means of selections, introductory and biographical notes, and articles-a panoramic view of current trends in Latin American poetry. Since then the review has featured "La poesia nadaista de Colombia" by Gonzalo Arango (Dec. 1963), "Siete poetas brasi- lefios actuales" by Walmir Alala (March 1964), "Encuentro de poetas" by Ron Con- nally (May 1964), "Cinco poetas chilenos" by Jose Donoso (June 1964), "Cuatro poetas salvadorefios" by Eunice Odio (July 1964), "Poesia vanguardista de Panama" by Aristides Martinez Ortega (Aug. 1964) and "Siete poetas uruguayos" by Safil Ibargoyen Islas (Oct. 1964). The Nov. 1964 number offers "Siete poetas argentinos" by Miguel Grinberg (editor of Eco Contempordneo in Buenos Aires) and Juan Carlos Martelli (author of Antologia de la poesia nueva en la Re- publica Argentina). Included are poems by Alberto Coust6, Alejandro Vignati, Leo- poldo Jose Bartolom6, Alejandra Pizarnik, Ignacio Beola, Marcelo Pich6n Riviere, and Juan Gelman. Observations by Grin- berg and Martelli on the present activity in literature and the arts in Argentina, as well as a brief discussion of the new generation of poets, serve as an introduc- tion. In addition, biographical notes preface each selection. Univ. of Arizona CHARLES A.

The forthright, prophetic rector of La Universi- dad Nacional de Nicaragua, he was a frequent contributor to magazines and newspapers. His articles encompassed a wide range: literary trends, cultural events, social-economic-political developments. He was popular with the young authors of Central America. One of the last letters he wrote shortly before lapsing into a coma on Oct. 5 was a note of appreciation for an item about his writings in Hispania. JAMES W. CARTY, JR. Bethany College, W. Va. Poesia vanguardista de Panamd.-The Aug. 1964 issue of Americas features an article on the poesia van guardista de Panamd. A general introduction and characterization of the movement is given, followed by selections and discussion of the works of several of its members. The poets included are: Carlos Francisco Chan- Marin, Tristan Solarte (Guillermo Sain- chez), Homero Icaza SAnchez, Jose de Jesuis Martinez, Guillermo Ross Zanet, Jose Franco and Demetrio Fibrega. The article is accompanied by photographs of each of the poets. Univ. of Arizona CHARLES A. KING Chilean notes.-Late in June 1964 novelist and short story writer Nicomedes Guzman died at the age of fifty. His best works were two novels, Los hombres os- curos (1939) and La sangre y la esperanza (1943), and a collection of two short stories entitled La came iluminada (1945). Guzmin, along with Juan Godoy, Fernan- do Alegria and others, belonged to Chile's Generation of 1938, and he was undoubt- ably the most representative of the prole- tarian novelists in this country. Francisco Coloane, author of Cabo de Hlornos, El iiltimno grumete de la Baque- dano, Tierra del Fuego se apaga, El ca- mino de la ballena, and numerous other works, was awarded the Premio Nacional de Literatura for 1964 on August 31. The voting committee consisted of Eugenio Gonzalez, Rector of the University of Chile, Ricardo Latcham, for the Ministry of Education, Roque Esteban Scarpa, for the Academia Chilena de la Lengua, and Angel Cruchaga Santa Maria and Diego Mufioz, for the Sociedad de Escritores de Chile. It was thought that the prize would go to a poet this year, but the committee failed to come to agreement on one of the three candidates (Pablo de Rokha, Juven- cio Valle and Humberto Diaz Casanueva). The rector proposed a list of prose writers and Coloane obtained the three votes neces- sary to win a majority. Coloane's stories about the ranchers, shepherds, and seal hunters in Chile's province of Magallanes and Argentina's Patagonia have been trans- lated into English, French, Swedish, Rus- sian, and Chinese. His drama Tierra del Fuego se apaga was staged in Santiago and then made into a movie in Argentina. Cabo de Hornos was also filmed as a joint Chilean-Mexican venture. The Premio Na- cional places Coloane among the greats of Chilean literature who have received the prize and who include D'Halmar, Barrios, Prado, Neruda and others. On September 5, poet Angel Cruchaga Santa Maria died at the age of seventy-one. One of his last acts was to participate in the committee which elected to grant the Premio Nacional to Francisco Coloane, although Cruchaga voted for poet Juvencio Valle. Cruchaga himself received the Pre- mio Nacional in 1948. His works include Las manos juntas, La selva prometida, Job, Los mdistiles de oro, La ciudad invisible, Paso de sombra and Antologia podtica. On September 27, U.S. Ambassador Charles Cole resigned his post and left Santiago. He had been in Chile for over three years, and was well-liked. French President Charles de Gaulle arrived in Chile at the northern port of Arica on September 29, in his specially equipped cruiser, the Colbert.

A banquet was held at the Palace on the first night of de Gaulle's arrival, and the French president recalled the bonds of friendship that have existed between the two nations since Chilean indepen- dence in 1810. De Gaulle spent more time in Chile than in any other country except Brazil during his Latin-American tour, leaving Santiago on the morning of Oct. 3, en route to Buenos Aires. Univ. of Kansas JOHN P.

Ha publicado una novela, Los rostros del miedo, desgraciadamente fallida y donde los personajes, desdibujados, se mueven como sombras o como fantasmas.

LEON BRIGHT Southern Colorado State College Rube'n Perez Ortiz (1914-1964).-From Bogotai comes the sad news of the death of the Head of the Bibliographical Section of the Instituto Caro y Cuervo. Correspond- ing member of the Colombian Academy, named twice "Bibliotecario del ano" (in 1959 and 1960), editor of the Anuario Bibliogrdfico Colombiano, and author, a few years ago, of the scrupulously docu- mented Seud6nimos colombianos (Bogoti, 1961), this devoted researcher and uni- versity teacher worked hard to bring order into areas of bibliographical chaos. Un- assuming by nature, painstakingly accurate by temperament, never satisfied with sec- ond-hand information, he was tireless in exploring primary sources. Pdrez Ortiz is sure to be missed by his many friends at home and abroad who benefitted from his bibliographical prowess as well as from his proverbial eagerness to be of assistance. He certainly will be missed by this one (to whom his help has been invaluable). Univ. of Toronto KURT L. LEVY Sutatenza-A Unique Project.-On a re- cent trip to South America, I felt quite fortunate to be able to visit several projects and to examine at some length the opera- tion of a dynamic organization of which little is probably known. It is called Suta- tenza or Popular Cultural Action. The main purpose of this civic organization, created by Monsefior Salcedo in the cen- tral part of Colombia, is to educate and raise the standard of living for approxi- mately 50 percent of the people in that country who live mostly in rural areas. Although the radio schools of Sutatenza were established in 1947 to be used locally in Colombia and originally for the express purpose of indoctrinating the other priests, this project has now grown into an educa- tional service for other Latin American nations as well. Sixteen countries send specialized students yearly to Bogota for courses and training in mass communica- tion and education. This program has been given aid by UNESCO. The countries most represented are those with more simi- lar problems; namely, Peru, Ecuador, Bo- livia, Venezuela and Brazil. The student representatives spend four months in Co- lombia.</page><page sequence="21">168 HISPANIA Previous to the establishment of Suta- tenza, the peasant had been practically ignored as an important link to the society. Even today, there is only one newspaper out of 836 publications in Colombia that is directed toward the farmer. This is a newspaper published weekly by Sutatenza called: El Campesino, with a circulation of 100 thousand copies and delivered to over 900 towns. It discusses common prob- lems and tries to aid the small agricul- turalist in improving his crops and his way of life. He is taught to do this on his own. To fully appreciate the work carried out by Sutatenza, it seems only fair to mention some of the facts that face this organiza- tion. First of all, it is estimated that the rate of illiteracy is at 42 percent. This fig- ure comes to seven million. Secondly, only five percent of the peasants are organized. When one considers the problems that exist in Colombia today, he soon realizes that Sutatenza is an absolute necessity. The name, Sutatenza, was originally applied only to a small town where this idea and movement began. However, to- day the name, Sutatenza is not restricted in referring to the town where the insti- tute for peasant leaders began, but also refers to both the downtown radio station and classroom building as well as the huge publishing plant located in the industrial section of Bogota. Most of the secretarial work is done at the publishing plant. Aside from the newspaper, a tremendous amount of correspondence is carried on between the peasants who write in and the Suta- tenza employees who answer this mail. A letter means a great deal to a person whose very existence had been ignored for years. The letters and replies indicate a feeling of dignity and purpose, which, prior to this time, could not even have been con- ceived. This all leads to the chief goal or aim of Sutatenza. It is very basic. Everybody needs to possess a certain amount of hu- man dignity. Without it a man is nothing. In order to acquire this particular state of human dignity, it is necessary to change the type of thinking that has guided the peasant up until now. To accomplish this objective, a five-step program has been set up, plus various effective methods to carry it beyond the initial stage. The main five steps, or notions as they are also called, are health, alphabet, number, work (which includes general information on cultivating the land), and Christianity. First of all, the peasant is taught that health and sani- tation tend to be a primary need in life. Number is important in that a basic knowl- edge of simple arithmetic is an almost un- avoidable daily experience. Alphabet in- troduces the peasant into an entirely new and fascinating world of reading and writ- ing. It puts him in contact with millions of people whom he would never have the chance to meet otherwise. This may all appear somewhat far-fetched or exaggerated to the average American reader. But, if one takes the time and interest to read some of the letters that have come to the Sutatenza plant, a person cannot help but be impressed by the hope and encourage- ment expressed by the grateful people who are thankful for this opportunity to be recognized. Recognition, however, is the first big step toward an uphill climb. After this, they begin to learn to help themselves. I was moved by several letters that I had the opportunity to read. The advice which they, the peasants, successfully followed and the enthusiasm expressed upon achiev- ing success in building a bed or clearing out a corner of their land is something that will touch even the most disinterested per- son. Work aids the farmer in improving his immediate financial situation. Finally, Christianity, or general belief in God, gives the peasant a basic philosophy or hope in life. The Catholic religion in the dog- matic sense is not forced upon them. Yet, the key people involved in this immense project are the clergy. Now the methods of instruction are varied. But most important of all is the radio. Other means are posters, records, correspondence, library, extension courses, agricultural institutes, and formation of leaders. The radio, which is the only item that the peasant actually purchases, is sold for US $19.50 and is imported from Japan. Books are acquired through a form of</page><page sequence="22">THE HISPANIC WORLD 169 barter, or simply one egg for one book. Everything else is supplied absolutely free of any cost whatsoever. Such items include classroom materials. The radio represents much more than a listening device. It is a symbol of learning,which has been ob- tained through a great deal of effort and probably, to some extent, through a degree of financial sacrifice. It gives the owner status in the community. A most interest- ing aspect of the radio is that only one station can be heard, Radio Sutatenza. This is merely a precaution against any lack of self discipline on the part of the peasant so that he cannot turn to another station to hear music when he should be concentrating on the lesson. However, after the lessons, there is a good variety of pro- grams; news, drama, education, and music and other phases of culture. The actual process of learning is some- what unique in itself. An improvised class- room is utilized into which 15 or 16 peas- ants come to follow the instructions of a teacher who coordinates his actions with those of the radio. Therefore, we have an audio-visual type of instruction, which is intended to reach a greater mass segment of the population from a centralized source. It is a well-coordinated program. Sutatenza has four main stations that broadcast 22 hours a day throughout the nation. They are located in Sutatenza, Medellin, Belen- cico and BogotA. Most of the cities are reached by radio broadcasts, with the ex- ception of those towns in remote areas and a few spots along the coast. Between three thousand and four thousand new radios are distributed each month. Over 3,200 letters are answered monthly. Forty tons of ma- terial, covering books, pencils, etc., are also used monthly. This is a big operation be- cause the teachers cannot be trained fast enough. I was fortunate enough to be able to attend a number of the classes conducted at Sutatenza for a particular seminar pro- gram. This was a rewarding experience in that I met people from all walks of life (priests, military, business, students, and so forth) discussing a complete array of topics, such as the rising cost of living, the lack of playgrounds, extensive spread of pornographic literature, extreme level of regionalism, ill feeling between those who attend rich schools and poor schools, and the accusation and resentment that sec- ondary education is an economic privilege that is in the hands of greedy, money- grabbing businessmen. One of the sessions covered the subject of Marxism and its threat to Colombia. Here are some of the remarks that were brought to light: The Soviet Union spends US $8 million a year on propaganda for Latin America. Propaganda leaflets are passed out in Bogo- ti in the poorer school districts and even in the Catholic schools. I saw one of them. The fact that four hours of religion per week are required in the school curriculum has alienated many people. The com- munists have been trying to divide the country through the center in a manner very similar to that which was done in China after World War II. The methods employed by the communists to recruit more strength to their ranks have been quite effective. They have attempted to add more Marxist professors to the staffs of universities, have tried to control the student organizations, and have made every effort to divide the anti-communist forces. Permanent courses outside of the university are utilized to indoctrinate future followers of their cause. Most interesting is the friendly approach offered to the new stu- dents who come into the city from the rural areas, quite often alone and perhaps a bit insecure. The out-of-town student is greeted cordially and immediately in- vited to parties so as to be lured into the communist ranks. In Colombia there is only one television station, and it is government controlled. There are about 120 radio stations with approximately 30 in and around BogotA. The equipment used at Sutatenza is of the latest design and is highly efficient. At the downtown radio station in Bogota there are nine studios. The main point is that Sutatenza is growing and its effect is being felt. Hamline Univ. WALTER H. MAYER, JR.</page><page sequence="23">170 HISPANIA Bullfighter in New York.-Robert Daley, in The New York Times for Nov. 29, 1964, tells of an ex-matador's experiences during a week's stay in New York: A Spanish bullfighter with great charm bat only a limited grasp of English has gone back to Madrid after struggling through a week of interviews and TV programs here to help pro- mote a book he hasn't read. He is Luis Miguel Dominguin, once Spain's finest matador but now 38 years old and retired. The book is "Love Lies Bleeding," by Peter Viertel. It is a novel about a bullfighter who resembles Dominguin and it is dedicated to him. Dominguin, who speaks French and Italian, too, considers English too illogical a language to learn to read: "So," he said, "I don't read book. You tell the truth in the book, Peter? Then I must leave country very fast." Dominguin had a reputation also for romances with Ava Gardner, with the Italian actress Lucia Bose (who is now his wife), and with others. So, for a week he had to parry questions such as, "Are you a great lover?" Answer: "I am retired from that business also." Most of his interviewers profess to have read the book, but the line of questioning sometimes raised doubts. "How big is the bull?" "I think is bigger than elephants." "What are your thoughts when the bull comes out?" "I think maybe this is last bull I see." "How smart is the bull?" "If the bull is very clever, I am not a bull- fighter." As the week wore on, Dominguin's English improved, but the interviewing didn't improve much. The attitude of one columnist seemed to be: Why should I write about you? So Domin- guin showed some of his scars. I)Dominguin had a wry smile on his face, as if to say: This you can understand, at least. Dominguin was gored 20 times, 5 times seriously. He described one bad goring that the surgeon repaired without anesthetic, because the use of drugs would have delayed the matador's return to active status. The only anesthetic was a handkerchief, which Dominguin bit on: "I ate three handkerchiefs that day." He didn't scream. "But it wasn't because I didn't want to." Day after day, Dominguin kept his sense of humor, although he got more and more restless and nervous. He posed all one morning for pic- tures, the first time in his life he had ever posed. He had even refused to pose for his friend, Picasso, because he can't keep still long. "I do it for Peter," Dominguin said. He gave Mr. Viertel's shoulder an affectionate squeeze, and called him a rude Spanish word. Dominguin now runs an import-export busi- ness, principally between Spain and South America, ranging from peanut oil to freighters to Soviet movies. He employs 300 persons, and his friends are people like Picasso and Mr. Vier- tel and his wife, Deborah Kerr. In the last year Domninguin has made 14 trips to South America. R. G. M. Portuguese Essays.-Fidelino de Figuei- redo has published a new volume of essays. They reveal the persistent and admirable effort of this "pobre eremita pensabundo" to overcome the self-pity which is only too natural in a man crippled in body, by accompanying, understanding, and helping others to understand the most advanced thought of our times in philosophy and science. The author's humanism animates his interpretation of ancient myths of the struggle of the human mind for light as darkness threatens to engulf it, his analysis of French existentialism, his rejection of its cosmic "nausea," or his defense of a refined theory of causality against the anthropomorphic revivals of beliefs in spontaneity. In this connection he calls attention to recent philosophical works by other Portuguese-Romeu de Melo's essay on Nietzsche and Fernando Pinho de Almeida's Cidncia e Filosofla (1962). The cult of friendship lends a personal glow to this humanism, inspiring the first and the last pages of the book, which are dedi- cated to the memory of an artist friend, Abel Cardoso. The work also gives the author an opportunity to display his talent as a humorous story teller, as he imagines a journalist's visit to the underworld, re- tells the ancient myths of Prometheus, Sisyphus and Athena's birth, or recalls for- gotten stories told by Maria Enriqueta and Armando Palacio Vald6s. A substitute for the conversation of a man with a lucid and generous mind, the book leaves the reader enriched and strengthens his faith in man (Simbolos e mitos. Col. Estudos e Documentos, 29. Lisbon: Publicag6es Eu- ropa-Amdrica, 1964. 186 --- [6] pp.) G. M. M. Cecilia Meireles.-In October 1964, the Camara Brasileira do Livro awarded its prize for the best book of poetry published in 1963 to Cecilia Meireles' Solombra. On November 10, the author died. With her</page><page sequence="24">THE HISPANIC WORLD 171 disappeared the best known and the purest Brazilian poetess. G. M. M. Alvaro Moreyra.-Alvaro Moreyra da Silva was one of the first literary craftsmen to perfect the light, humorous or senti- mental commentary known as crdnica in Brazil. Born in 1888 in P6rto Alegre, he died in Rio de Janeiro on September 12, 1964. He had helped to edit several periodi- cals: Fon-Fon (since 1910), Para Todos (started in 1918) and Dom Casmurro (1936). It was he who published the first poems of the modernistas in Para Todos. His own best books of cranicas, among them Tempo perdido, date from the. twenties and thirties. G. M. M. Gilberto Freyre in U.S.-The noted Bra- zilian sociologist was in New York in October 1964, to lecture at Columbia Univ. about "0 Nordeste do Brasil como regido- problema continental." G. M. M. Portuguese Librarians' Journal.-Early in 1964, a group of younger Portuguese librarians and archivists, anxious to mod- ernize their profession and raise its tech- nical competence, started publication of a review, Cadernos; Biblioteconomia e Archi- vistica. G. M. M. Intellectuals and the Brazilian "Revolu- tion."-Some intellectuals within and with- out Brazil have been concerned over the evolution of the mild military dictatorship which last March ousted the corrupt and muddling Goulart cabinet. Alceu Amoroso Lima spoke out against arbitrary measures. The fears of a shift to the "hard-line" conservatism of the far Right were sum- marized in "Brazil, Suppressing the Fu- ture", an article published by Ronald H. Chilcote, of the Univ. of California at Riverside, in The Nation of November 23, 1964. The foreign creditors' satisfaction with Brazil's economic stabilization was expressed by Senator Wayne Morse during the final session of the 88th Congress; his remarks appeared in the November 1 issue of the Brazilian Bulletin published in New York City by the Brazilian Government Trade Bureau. G. M. M. Brazilian Plays in U.S.-Journey to Ba- hia, Stanley Richards' English adaptation of Dias Gomes' play O Pagador de Pro- messas, widely known through its filmed version, was first performed on October 23, 1964, in Washington, D.C., by the Actors Company, under the sponsorship of the new Brazilian American Cultural Institute. As part of a Festival of Arts and Crafts of Brazil, the Commercial Museum at the Civic Center of Philadelphia sponsored the performance of Ariano Suassuna's farce The Rogue's Trial by the Society Hill Playhouse Company on November 28 and December 6, 1964. On December 8, the Gramercy Theater in New York City was to show On the Necessity of Being Polyga- mous, a translation of Jose da Silveira Sam- paio's satirical comedy Da Necessidade de Ser Poligamo. The author, a physician and playwright, died on November 24 in Rio de Janeiro. He had become popular through his weekly television program of political commentaries and imaginary inter- views. G. M. M. New Po r t u g u e s e Dictionary.-An- nounced in this column in September, 1964, The New Appleton Dictionary of the English and Portuguese Languages was published in October (comps. An- t6nio Houaiss and Catherine B. Avery. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1964. xx, 636, xx, 665 pp. $11.75. Distributed outside North America in two volumes, as The New Barsa Dictionary of the English and Portuguese Languages.) With its more than 120,000 entries, this new dictionary compares favorably in several respects with other recent works of its type. The New Appleton is the first to give the pronuncia- tion of all main entries in the International Phonetic Alphabet in the Portuguese part (according to Brazilian pronunciation ac- cording to the standards set by the First Brazilian Congress of the Language Spoken in the Theater of 1956), as well as in the</page><page sequence="25">172 HISPANIA English part (reflecting North American pronunciation.) Sampling the entries from "P" through "packet-boat" in the English-Portuguese part, one finds 32 main entries in the New Appleton, compared to 36 in the Novo Michaelis (2d ed., S. Paulo, 1960), 27 in H. Michaelis' New Dictionary (reprinted by F. Ungar, New York, n.d.), 23 in J. L. Campos, Jr.'s Dicionario Ingle's-Portu- guds (S. Paulo, 1952), and 13 in H. Aliandro's pocketbook Diciondrio (New York, 1956). Only the New Appleton in- cludes such American terms as "Pacific Standard Time," "package deal" and "package store." It is also best in guiding the user among most of the different renderings of "pack" by listing mago (de cigarros), mochila (de viagem), matilha (de cdes), alcateia (de ldbos), quadrilha (de malfeitores), montao, porgao (de mentiras), mdscara (de lamna, cosmi tico), safra (por enlatar oit encaixotar). The England- oriented Novo Michaelis includes such items as "pabular," "pabulary," "paced," "pachisi," "pachydermia," "pachydermous," "pacifiable," "packery" and "packet day," which are omitted from the New Apple- ton. As for the Portuguese-English part, James L. Taylor's Portuguese-English Dic- tionary (Stanford, 1958) contains more technical terms and scientific Latin names for plants and animals. While sampling the few words from caqui to card, which may include as many as five Brazilianisms, one finds 5 main entries in the New Appleton, with 25 Portuguese expressions illustrating various uses of cara as a feminine noun and a listing of it as a masculine noun, a Brazilian slang term being translated as "guy, duck; strange face." Only Taylor lists this slang ex- pression also, but limits himself to the last of the three English translations. Taylor offers 7 entries, because he includes such technical terms as caquibosa (Bot.) and caquidrose (Med.). Taylor is the only one to list the names of six varieties under card, "yam." The Novo Michaelis, vol. ii (S. Paulo, 1961) has 5 main entries, with 33 expressions involving cara (s.f.), but does not include cara (s.m.) Aliandro's pocketbook Portuguese-English Dictionary (New York, 1960) lists only one main entry, cara (s.f.), illustrating its usage with 7 expressions. In conclusion, it can be seen that the New Appleton is the best available Ameri- can English-Brazilian Portuguese diction- ary for present-day usage, including col- loquial usage. G. M. M. Brazil in Spain.-The Revista de Cul- tura Brasileiia, published in Madrid by the Brazilian Embassy under the editorship of Angel Crespo, maintains its quality in the October 1964 issue. Dimaso Alonso and Crespo offer translations of eleven poems by Vinicius de Moraes, Crespo alone, translations of 21 poems from F. Mendes Vianna's A Chave e a Pedra (1960). Joaquim-Francisco analyses Gui- maries Rosa's uses of sound effects in the novel Grande Sertao: Veredas, while Stefan Baciu points out the dynamic qualities of Adonias Filho's novel Corpo vivo. Nieto Alcalde reviews Germain Bazin's Aleija- dinho et la sculpture baroque au Bresil (Paris: Les Editions du Temps, 1963) and Pilar G6mez Bedate discusses the Brazilian entries for the 32nd Biennale of Venice. Luis G6mez Mesa enthusiastically recom- mends Vidas secas and Deus e o Diabo na terra do sol, two Brazilian motion pictures shown at the Cannes Festival in 1964. Three projects of the Diairios Associados chain for the 400th anniversary of Rio de Janeiro are described: a "culture caravan" from Spain and Portugal to tour the prin- cipal cities of Brazil, erection of a Spanish pavilion which is to serve permanently as a Casa de la Cultura Espafiola, and an exposition of pictures taken in Spain by Latin American photographers, to be pub- lished later on as a book in Brazil. G. M. M. Ve'rtice.-The monthly review VWrtice (Coimbra) for July-August contained several contributions by or about the late journalist and critic Ramos de Almeida, who died in 1963. The same issue in- cludes the final critical suggestions offered</page><page sequence="26">THE HISPANIC WORLD 173 by Pedro da Silveira for a truly complete edition of Cesairio Verde's works, and notes by Matos Godinho and Luis Francisco, Rebello on the first international theater festival held in Lisbon, May 30-31, 1964, with companies from Belgium, France, Greece, Spain (Compafiia Maritza Caba- llero), and Portugal. G. M. M. Seara Nova.-No. 1429 (November 1964) of the Lisbon monthly contains another part of Jos6 Rodrigues Migueis' novel of a "seareiro," Idealista no mundo real, which is gaining in psychological depth as its drama is unfolding. There is also a report on novelist Ferreira de Castro's declarations about writing and freedom of expression before a factory audience in northern Portugal and a re- view of Luis Francisco Rebello's latest play, Condenados a vida, which received the drama prize of the Sociedade Portu- guesa de Escritores, awarded for the first time in 1964. Artur Ramos, the reviewer, calls it true to life as a portrait of the present-day bourgeois in Portugal, "civica e moralmente empobrecido . . . um pobre diabo relativamente honesto, resignado a aceitar uma vida de que s6 por acidente se liberta." G. M. M. "Col6quio."-The Lisbon quarterly in- cluded in its October 1964 issue Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen's translation of Hamlet's first monologue (". . . Deixai que nao me lembre ... fragilidade o teu nome 6 mulher! / Um curto mes-antes que esti- vessem gastos os sapatos / Com os quais seguiu o corpo de meu pobre pai / Como Niobe coberta de ligrimas-porqu6 ela, at6 ela? /.. ."), an essay by David Mourdo- Ferreira on the Daedalus-Icarus myth in the poetry of the two friends Sai Carneiro and Fernando Pessoa, and an essay on similar attitudes towards language in Aqui- lino Ribeiro and Miguel de Cervantes. G. M. M. Portuguese Bibliography.-The January- March 1964 issue of the Boletim Inter- nacional de Bibliografia Luso-Brasileira (Lisbon) features an extensive bibliography compiled by Ruben Andresen Leitdo which concerns Pedro V of Portugal, a popular king who ruled from 1855 to 1861, be- friended the writer Alexandre Herculano and "never signed a single death sentence." It also contains the first part of the author index for the weekly review Panorama (1837-1868), edited in its beginnings by Alexandre Herculano. G. M. M. Portuguese Stories.-Ernesto Leal's col- lection O homen que comia ndvoa (Coll. Os Livros das Tres Abelhas, 73. Lisbon: Publicay6es Europa-America, 1964. 185 pages) consists of thirteen stories varying greatly in their settings: several regions of Portugal, the Islands, Hong-Kong, Goa. Without literary pretensions, Leal succeeds in capturing the flavor of simple con- versations. The tone is humorous, but the background is nearly always sad. Portu- guese exasperation at an American busi- nessman's lack of sympathy with the customary courtesies is well rendered in the story "Aquele chefe americano." The repressed atmosphere hits the reader be- tween the eyes in "A hora do rango," as he is made to hear the comments of pedestrians on a street in Lisbon when they hear an Englishman singing to himself while walking. "-E ingl&amp;s, pa. E maluquinho. -Olha o gajo, hem? A cantar! Raios o partissem! -Canta! isso! Canta! Olhem qu'isto!!! -Um pano encharcado nas trombas!" And the writer adds: "Outros populares tinham caras muito tristes e nio disseram nada. Tinham s6 caras muito tristes" (p. 58). G. M. M. Brazilian Christmas Gift.-Stella Leo- nardos is a poetess in Rio de Janeiro who has written many poems for adults, and stories and plays for children. Her latest book is written for adults, but in a child- like spirit. In it she has used the customs, Brazilian folklore, and personal memories of Christmas with unashamed sentimen- tality, as she reacts against the com- mercialization of the holiday ("Noeis in- dustriados,/Noeis em pessoa,/vermelhos e</page><page sequence="27">174 HISPANIA suados,/nos vendem Natais.") She calls on the good spirits of folk tradition in poems, such as "Cheganqas de marujos," "De pastoris," "Reisado em Sergipe," "Con- gado," "Cristaos-e-mouros," "Folia de Reis," "Oi, sse boi ` bumba!" (Cancioneiro do Natal, Rio de Janeiro: Livraria Sao Jose, 1964. 114 pp.) G. M. M. Overseas Portuguese Cultural Society.- "A society has been formed to halt what is viewed as a notable decline in the knowl- edge of the Portuguese language and cul- ture among two million emigrants and their descendants throughout the world. "The formation of the International So- ciety of Portuguese Culture was one of the decisions taken by the first Congress of Portuguese Communities Abroad, currently meeting here. "Another decision called for the estab- lishment of a confederation of all Portu- guese associations abroad for coordination and development of their activities and contacts. A third was for the publication of a review of the Portuguese communities and their activities and problems. "The decisions were announced by An- driano Moreira, former Portuguese Minis- ter for Overseas Territories and now presi- dent of Lisbon's Geographic Society, which is sponsoring the congress. "Portugal's primary contribution to civili- zation, as established by the congress, is 'a racial ecumenism,' a thirst to know and be one with the cultures of other races. This has led to a large extent to the situation the society will attempt to improve. "The second major contribution was said to be spread of Christianity. Portuguese priests and missionaries followed in the paths of navigators and have had lasting influence from Boston to Singapore. "The congress, which ends Dec. 16, emphasized the current 'crisis' among Por- tuguese communities abroad. Because of their great adaptibility, they were said to be in danger of losing their identity" (The New York Times, Dec. 14, 1964). R. G. M. "Brazilian American Cultural Institute. -September 8, 1964, saw the opening of the Brazilian American Cultural Institute, Inc., a non-profit organization dedicated to the better knowledge and understand- ing in the United States of Brazilian cul- ture in all its aspects. The opening was attended by Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Brazilian Ambassador Juracy Magalhaes and many Brazilian and American per- sonalities. "The Institute is located at 2129 S Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., (tele- phone 234-6666); anyone interested in Brazil is welcome to avail himself of the Institute's facilities. Outstanding among the services performed by the BACI are the Portuguese language and Brazilian literature classes. Classes in Portuguese language are offered twice a week for be- ginners, intermediate and advanced stu- dents. "Henry Moore retrospective in Rio.- Rio de Janeiro's Museum of Modern Art announced the opening, on January 5, 1965, of a large retrospective exhibit of the work of the English sculptor Henry Moore. This will be the first artistic event to celebrate the IV Centennial of Rio de Janeiro. The British Government will offi- cially participate in the exhibit through the British Council. "Fourth Centennial of Rio de Janeiro.- The Government of Guanabara State, which is mainly composed of the city of Rio de Janeiro, prepared an extensive pro- gram of activities to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the city (the precise date of the foundation is January 20, 1565, and since January 20 is Saint Sebastian's day, the city was named Sao Sebastido do Rio de Janeiro, still its official name). "These are some of the events, amongst others: from January 10 to 17-I Pan- American Seminar of Architecture Stu- dents; from March 15 to 30-International Photography Exhibit; from March to De- cember-a retrospective exhibit on posts and telegraph; from June 24 to July 22- an exhibit of contemporary French painters at the Museum of Modern Art (MAM); during the month of June-an international</page><page sequence="28">THE HISPANIC WORLD 175 soccer tournament; from June 12 to De- cember 31-an exhibit-"Portugal Today"; opening on July 1st-a Portuguese Biblio- graphical exhibit; from July 18 to August 10-International Ornithology Exhibit; on August 7th-presentation of Bach's "Pas- sion According to St. Matthew" (first per- formance in Portuguese); from August 27 to September 12-at the Museum of Mod- ern Art, the International Salon of Plastic Arts; on August 16 and 17-a Japanese Exhibit of Modern Plastic Arts to be shown at the MAM; during September- an Exhibit of Books and Bibliographical Material from the Library of the National Museum; last week in September and first week in October-International Film Festi- val and Festival of Brazilian Films; from October 20 to 28-international Philatelic Exposition; November 17-the IV Bra- zilian Jazz Concert; in December-Exhibit of Japanese Architecture in Photography. "Aside from these events an all-year- round program has been scheduled which will include a series of concerts by national and foreign artists and archestras, guided tours.to museums and churches, sports and folklore events, conventions, etc. . . . In short, 1965 will be the year to visit Rio" (Cultural News from Brazil, Aug.-Dec, 1964).
