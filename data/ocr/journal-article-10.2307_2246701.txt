<plain_text><page sequence="1">II.--M.RENOUVIER'S PHILOSOPHY.--PSYCHOLOGY. DURING the Hegelian supremacy, it is said, the great question decisive of every man's position was--Are you Ontologist or Psychologist ? The great Corresponding question at present is-- :Are you Philosopher or Scientist, are you Metaphysician or Empiricist ? The importance of M. Renouvier's system is, that it is a thorough-going system of Phenomenism, and yet is philo- sophical, larger than science, and metaphysical in that sense of</page><page sequence="2">174 H. BRenouvier's Philosophy.-Psychology. the term in which it is opposed at once to ontology and to em- piricism. This was sufficiently shown in my former article (MIND XXI.), which carried us to the end of the Logic, the first of M. Renouvier's two fuindamental works. We have now to deal with the second, the Psychology.' After the analysis of the phenomena of consciousness for themselves, given in the Logic, comes naturally the examination of them in the living concrete form in which we experience them, namely, so grouped as to form the functions of conscious beings; and this examination is Psychology, which is the complement of the Logic, and that in two ways. First, the divisions of the Psychology are given by the categories of the Logic, the functions of conscious beings demarcated by the fundamental distinctions of the phenomena of consciousness. And secondly, Psychology is the first and most general of that group of philosophical sciences which the Logic concluded by establishing, sciences seated, as it were, astride the frontier of the seen and unseen worlds, and, in virtue of that double character, dealing with probabilities and beliefs suggested by man's moral and intellec- tual nature. The Psychology accordingly falls into three Parts. The first coincides most closely with what is commonly understood by psychology, the examination of the functions of conscious living beings; the second treats of the problem of Certitude, and forms the bridge to the third and last, which examines Kant's three great problems, Immortality, Liberty, and God. " We will treat successively the universal data of human nature in rela- tion to the different functions of consciousness in which they make their appearance, and for this purpose we will follow the guiding thread of the categories, going from the simplest and most abstract to the most complex, which are the most real. We shall next be able to treat the question of certitude, and then the nature and arrangement of the sciences. After which, returning to ouLr most general object, we shall extend our view to the probable sphere open to man's development in the world, and to the physical and moral laws which govern his destiny." (I. 10.) The passage from the Logic to the Psychology is formed by the coAsideration, that personality, which is the last of the nine Categories, is implied, in the concrete, as the condition of all the rest. The Logic gave us, in order of ascending complexity, the nine categories of Relation, Number, Position, Succession, Quality, Becoming, Causality, Final-causation, and Personality. When we turn to their concrete realisation in experience, we must begin with the last, since it is only in the representations of some given personal consciousness that the phenomena of this and all the categories are known to us. I Traitd de Psychollogie Rationnelle. 2nd editioni, 3 vols. Paris, 1875.</page><page sequence="3">M. Renouvier's Philosophy.-Psychology. 175 "Man, then, is a certain centre, a meeting point, of the categories, be- cause they are, in him, the laws comprehending (enveloppantes) all that he knows or can know, and, from another point of view, because they compre- hend him also by gathering together to form that eminently complex and special compound, which is the union of his body and his person." (I. 4.) If we consider man under those relations only which belong to the categories of number, position, succession, change, with certain inherent qualities, but abstracting from sensibility, we get, as our object, man physical and organic. And this is the first division of the subject. (I. 5.) If to these categories we join that of personality, in a given consciousness, and as a centre of experience, we have maii sensi- tive, a something opposed to phenomena other than himself. This is the second division of the subject. (lb.) Now Causality and Final-causation are inseparably attached to Personality; and accordingly the addition of these gives us the final divisions of the subject: " When in man, as a being self-represented to self, we envisage particu- larly act and cause conscious of itself, we get the will: man is will. When we envisage tendency and purposed end, we get emotion (passion): man is emotion. When we envisage any of the personal functions as it were re- flected by a kind of reduplication of consciousness, we get understanding and reason: man is intelligence. (I. 6.) Supplementing this rough classification, taken from the first preliminary chapter, with later statements, we find the place of intelligence, which is here left somewhat uncertain, much more definitely marked. Reflective consciousness is the central point of the whole classification of functions, and divides them into two parts, a lower and an upper portion, the lower including (1) man physical and organic, (2) man as sensibility, in connexion with whicli are treated the laws of association, (3) man as in- telligence, including reason, use of symbols or signs, and language. The upper portion contains (4) reflective consciousness, (5) man as emotion (passion), (6) man as will; and the treatment of these subjects is followed by chapters on the decline or degrada- tion of consciousness, on the relation between the higher and lower functions, on the relation between emotion and conscious- ness, and on the question of liberty, which concludes the first Part of the work. Reflective consciousness, then, is the centre of the whole. At the beginning of the chapter which treats of it, we read as follows: " The divisions which I have hitherto brought forward bear on laws which, while combined in man under the law of consciousness, are yet essentially characteristic of the not-self: relation, number, position, suc- cession, becoming, quality. The functions which depend on these cate- gories, namely, comparison, numneration, imagination, memory, trains of</page><page sequence="4">176 LRc.Renouqvier's Philosophy.-Psychology. thought, reason, have a common character, which is that of subordination of the representing to the represented element in the representations. From this point of view we may call them by a common name, that of intelli- gence." (I. 215.) Intelligence, then, wheni not incorporated with reflection, but considered ver se, comes in last and highest of the lower functions of man, the higher being constituted by reflection and intelli- gence in union with emotion and volition. " The sequel of the inquiry, enabling us to define the nature and bear- ing of the facts of emotion and force " [will] " in man, will show in What sense, and up to what point, the affective principle and the volitional prin- ciple are to be distingtished from one another and from intelligence. Admit these elements as logically irreduLcible, as our analysis of the cate- gories has already shown, in a general way, that they are, and man will appear to us, from this point onwards, as a synthesis of three forms essential to the existence and laws of'consciousness and its variations. To these we must join the forms of sensibility, a fourth necessary condition, inherent as a general rule in the production of phenomena of experience under the laws of extension, and united in human nature with the different organic and physical functions which make part of these phenomena." (I. 217.) Appended to the first preliminary chapter are some " Observa- tions," in which with equal force and subtilty M. Renouvier both expounds his own position and distinguishes it from that of two opposite psychological schools, opposite to him, and also to each other, and justifies its title of Rational Psychology. His own words will best explain his scope: "The foregoing chapter defines the nature of a rational psychology, such as we can conceive it at the present day. Formerly this name designated a pretended science, founded on metaphysical a prioris, wherein people flattered themselves that they demonstrated apodictically the existence and the immortality of a separate soul. There men studied the factlties of the soul, as so many mysterious entities joined to a main entity. But the method which is really rational must fix its attention on psychical pheno- mena and the investigation of their laws. The powers of the soul are then nothing else than certain of these laws, that is to say, that series of pheno- mena, definite in kind, are bound to evolve themselves in time, in such manner as the laws express, under appropriate conditions,." (L 11.) There we have his opposition to ontological psychology. "Rational Psychology may rightly be called also empirical psychology, inasmuch as it moves by observation of the facts of consciousness. But it does not allow that this observation of facts can be emancipated from the principal laws constitutive of the observing mind. That which makes it rational is, that it does not separate the psychical facts from the forms of grouping them which are given in the categories." (. 12.) There we have his own middle position. "There is a psychological doctrine which aims at absolute empiricism, and would like to deduce, not merely state as facts, such laws as those of space, time, and others not less irreducible. I have spoken of the associa-</page><page sequence="5">A. Renouvier's Philosophy.-Psychology. 177 tionist school on many occasions in the Logic. As it is after all impossible to undertake any inental analysis without supposing laws, or mental syn- theses, previously given, the associationist school itself has necessarily taken a law as point of departure. It has chosen the law of association, or con- nexion and sequence of ideas, which appeared to it the most indispensable of all; and not wishing to cassume others, as it must have done if it had dis- tinguished various modes of association or grouping, it has assumed that a previous entirely empirical conjunction (rapprochement) and habit are the sole agents of all connexion in observed phenomena. Now this is an hypothesis for which the associationist school offers no direct justification, and which is contrary to the conditions of thought actually observable, that is to say, to the existence of laws inseparable from thought itself. It is attempted to justify the hypothesis a posteriori, by deducing these laws, and explaining their original formation; but then it is impossible to avoid petitions of principle, as I have shown in my criticism of Stuart Mill and Mr. Bain. But even with the aid of this illusory method the associationists have not made their reduction complete, as their system requires them to do. For instance, time, memory, and in fine the mind itself, offer an in- vincible resistance. Why it is so.will be understood, if we reflect that the question is to demonstrate the origin of the laws constitutive of the mind, while basing the demonstration on connected phenomena, the connexion of which is intelligible only in the form of those very laws ! " (I. 12, 13.) There we have his opposition to the psychology of the asso- ciationists; and I do not know where the fundamental objection to their theory has been either more clearly stated or more powerfully urged. Having thus obtained a general view of M. RenouvTier's posi- tion, it is necessary before going farther, to inquire what is the validity of his mode of transition from the Logic to the Psycho- logy, which we have seen consists in this, that the object-matter of the Psychology is the actual and concrete realisation, or ex- emplification, of the abstract categories of the Logic. I seem to myself to find a lacuna in M. Renouvier's theory here, which, owing to the critical point at which it occurs, is a serious one. It is this, that no account is given of the passage from the one general system of categories, embracing consciousness and exis- tence at ]arge, to the particular iiidividual conscious beings who have partial and different perceptions of existence at large, and are the objects of psychology. The laculla (if it be one) is, covered from observation by an ambiguous phrase in the second sentence of the book: " The categories are the general laws of representation. The only re- presentation of which we can speak with assuranice is the humnan. It is in it that the categories are given to us, as is also the matter of experience. The categories posit the forms of this matter, the rules of this experience." (I. 1.) I To call the categories laws of human representation is true so far as kind goes; when we speak of representation we mean</page><page sequence="6">178 il'. Renouvier's Ph1losophy.-Psychotogy. such representation as man's; and that is enough for general logic or metaphysic. But it does not necessarily imply a plurality of particular conscious beings. This is a fact which must be accounted for separately. A single universal conscious- ness would equally satisfy the requirement of being a realisation of the categories, and would equally- be a human consciousness,, though on a vast scale. We suddenly find ourselves, on opening the Psychology, in' presence of individual particular conscious- nesses; we have before us " a given consciousness, with a certain content of experience, the elements of which it combines " (I. 5),, one consciousness generalised and representing all; and yet no account is given of how this plurality comes into the field.. That surely is a lacuna. It would be no answer to say, that plurality is found in the categories. So likewise are quality, number, limitation, &amp;c., in ^short all the forms which are requisite for understanding objects when once they are given in perception or imagination. The. question is, how there come to be more conscious centres of the categories than one; more realisations of them than one sub- jectively, when there is but one world represented objectively ?' The categories may perhaps be conceived as necessarily bound' up with a living, personal, representing being. But what is there to show that this being is not an Absolute Mind ? There is only one way, in my opinion, of meeting this diffi- pulty, and that is by avowing it; only one way of filling the lacuna, and that is by placing there a distinction, the distinction between nature and history, justifyina it by 'metaphysical analysis. We then, at this point, frankly leave philosophy and enter upon science (though always under guidance of philoso- phical distinctions), in entering upon the subject of psychology. Unless we make this avowal, and draw this (or some equivalent) distinction, we shall inevitably find ourselves treating the notions. of things as if they were the things themselves, and making those notions (in this instance the categories) into efficient con- ditions of the existence of the things. We shall have an a priori psychology founded on metaphysical laws, a psychology which' would be inadmissible as science, even thouglh the laws were true in metaphysic, which is not wholly the case with the categories, as I have in some measure shown in my former' article. M. Renouvier does irot, in my opinion, escape this almost inevitable consequence; and it is shown by his application of the categories to determine the functions of consciousness in psycho-- logy. He lays great stress on this application. In speaking of the methods of psychology, in his chapter on reflective conscious- ness, he says:</page><page sequence="7">MX Renouvier's Philosophy.-Psychology. 179 "I have applied to the first categories this method of classification which I am surprised to find is new. Readers can judge whether it gives results unconstrained and well co-ordinated. It would not have escaped Kant, had it not been for the singular pre-occupation of mind which led that great man to admiit the dlata of ordinary psychology at the very moment when he was aiming at subjecting the whole content of the mind to criti-- cism. He believed he could obtain the categories by deduction, not per- ceiving that, in order to avoid positing as a priori facts those notions upon which all other notions depend, he was accepting other notions which had nothing but authority in their favour, and even the definition of which was extremely imperfect." (I. 214.) Kant, I imagine, saw what M. Renouvier does not see, that overs and above the forms in which consciousness worked, among which are the categories, there must be something working in those forms. The forms are one thing, the worker another; and the worker cannot be resolved into the forms alone, but is some- thing concrete or empirical, a compound of form and matter, Again, even supposing M. Renouvier's categories to be the true ultimate forms of thought, they yet give no reason why somn are applicable to particular cases, and others not. Granting' they are applicable to the course of nature, still they give no explanation why that course takes its actual windings under them. There is a particular stream of events, the history of the world, to be accounted for. Causation of one thing by another is what science has to investigate, not the general applicability of forms of thought to all things. The old psychology, rightly abandoned by M. Renouvier, saw this also. The soul and its faculties were efficient causes. The soul ftirnished at any rate a professing explanation of how con- sciousness arose in certain particular beings. The consciousness with which psychology deals is consciousness defined by its time, place, and conditions of existence, that is to say, in con- nexion with its organism. But the consciousness with which metaphysic and M. Renouvier's Logic deal, is consciousness de- fined by the objective world which is its counterpart and con- tent. Without some theory of causation, that is, of the condi- tioning of particular things by one another, in order to their coming into or departure out of existence, psychology is no science at all, but a mere reflex of metaphysic. Causation is the feature which distinguishes psychology, as the first of the sciences, from metaphysic the condition of them all. If on the other hand we assume causation from the first, and begin with the facts of consciousness grouped as they are grouped in psycho- logy, then we get no metaphysic at all, no philosophy properly speaking, but merely a generalisation of psychological laws: we get, not what M. Renouvier professes to give us, a Psychology based on General Logic, but a General Logic based on Psychology</page><page sequence="8">180 Zl. Renouvier's Philosophy.-Psychology. I amn not charging M. Renouvier with ignoring this difference; he himself remarks at one place: " Thle knowledge of causes, such as is within our reach, is without value for philosophy ". (I. 26.) Still less am I charging him with excluding cause from psychology, which he certainly does not, as will be evident from, the very next point which falls to be considered. But my ob- jection is, that he has nothing in his theory corresponding to' these admitted facts, and that I call a lacuna. At length then we may take M. Rienouvier to be fairly launched. The transition from the Logic being accomplished, the Psychology begins. Here the first question which occurs, in the case of a psychologist who gives up as untenable the notion of a soul as entity, is this,-how he replaces it. Re- placing the soul and its faculties by phenomenal states of con- s,siousness, what is the relation in which he conceives these to stand to the organism ? The soul and its faculties were regarded as exercising a real causative agency; does he conceive the states of consciousness, which he now makes the object of psychology in their stead, as doing so too ? Does consciousness re-act on the organism ? Is a state of consciousness ever a necessary. link in the chain of events intervening between an impression received by the brain and the movement (in nerve or muscle), which follows it ? Or, on the contrary, does he conceive that the states of consciousness, exercising no re-action, are never links in such a chain, but are merely the accompaniments and the evidence of processes in the organism which are physical in their whole extent, so far as their causation is concerned, notwithstanding that they are knowable and nameable onlly by mneans of their conscious accompaniments, as actions for instinc- tive or desired ends ? M. Renouvier leaves us in no doubt of his view on these points: " The facts of consciousness prove that there exists also a commiencement anc a term of phenomena in representations as representative. Between the action and r&amp;-action of the substantialist (materialist) school, there interposes (in a whole order of cases) a fact which physics and biology cannot lay hold of in their special order of observation, with their methods ancl instruments, a fact which on the other hand they cannot, deny, con- sciousness itself. Sensibility properly so called and the emotions are not terms in the series of the centripetal and centrifuLgal modifications given in the field of natural science,,an-d nevertheless it is the case that they mark -the specific end of some of these modifications, and the origin of others. The solution of continuLity in respect of the kind of the phenomena is in- 'evitable. And be it remarked, that I do not yet speak of the will." (I. 360-1.) His theory is, that representations of certain higher kinds, as distinguished from the innervations on which they depend, are</page><page sequence="9">M. Renouvier's Philosopliy.-Psychology. 181 necessary causal links in the sequences where they occur, con- tributing to determine their issue; and among these representa- tions he does not include states of will. The' will is a further and deeper causal agency still, acting on and in representa:tions, which have, alone and independently of the will, a causal agency upon the organism. The will may call up in the brain a representation of a desirwd end, but it is the representation which determines the movement to realise the end. Five distinct cases of the agency of representations are enumer- ated; (1) instinctive movements with obscure conscioushess of them, and where the represenitation of the end may be either. clear or obscure; (2) movements following emotions, where the movements themselves are not foreseen or even represented at the moment; (3) similar movements following the imagination of real objects; (4) similar movements following the imnagination of objects regarded as merely possible; (5) movements following a volition. (I. 367-8.) As to the will, in its relation to these determinations, we find him saying at another place, after repeating the foregoing enu- meration: "c The will can precede a great number of these facts of locomotion which occur at other times without will; and it precedes none of them which m7ay not in certain cases occur spontaneously. We know besides, and it is uni- versally admitted, that a movement is never attributable to the will as such (volontJformelle), unless the imagination first envisages it, unless a certain end which consciousness proposes, consequently a certain emotion, stands as its motive. On this simple view of the case we mniust concludle, it would seem, that what we call the will is not, properly speaking, cause of loco- motion, that there is ambiguity and bad logic in so taking it. Hence the division of movements into voluntary and involuntary is without signifi- cance for biology; the real difference between them lies entirely in the representations, one set of facts occurring in consequence of a consciousness which fashions and fixes itself by setting some of its own states in opposi- tion to others, and the other set of facts arising with an unre.flected, or con- fuLsed, or obscure consciousness, or even one altogether unassignable, whether of the movement itself or of its purpose." (I. 394.) We see-how clear and peremptory is M. Renouvier's rejection of the alternative theory, that which, in psychology, denies causality to consciousness altogether, and has been nicknamed the "'conscious-automaton" theory. He maintains, we have seen, that in five different cases consciousness exercises a real power, and impresses a new direction on the organism. The next question is, at what precise point does this re-active agency strike in ? Do all representations, as distinguished from pre- sentations, -exert it ? Is it a property of the pleasurable or painful quality of the representations, so that those which are pleasant cause a movement to retain or increase them, those which are painful a movement to avoid them ? We have seen</page><page sequence="10">182 -Al. Renouvier's Philosophy.-Psychology. that volition does not furnish the demnarcation, neither does the emotional character of states of consciousiiess as distinguished from the imaginative, nor the imaginative as distinguished from the emotional, as we see from both kinds being included in the five cases. MI. Renouvier's statements on this point are not pushed so far as might be wished; nevertheless his meaning is clear so far as it goes. It is, that reflective consciousness, including volitional, emotional, and intellectual functions, enables consciousness to re- act on the organism. Below the point of reflection, we have the inferior functions which belong properly to biology, above it the superior functions Wvhich belong to psychology. This, then, is the turning point of re-action, where the lower functions cease solely to govern the higher, and the higher begin to re-act upon the lower. But it will be remarked that this point is still left vague, inasmuch as the functions of intellect, volition, and emotion, are included in the moment of reflection which gives the demarcation. It is rather a tract than a line which is given as the frontier. " When the being is envisaged at that degree of phenomenal evolution where we have him as a complete organism with emotional and volitional functions, a new and inverse order of - causality takes effect; observable, it is true. only within the limits of the higher animality, but that is etough, and the law which I put in evidence has just that significance. The func- tjons which are raised to the level of consciousness subordinate to them- selves and govern, more and more, the inferior functions, and nature in some sort changes her front.-The study of the first order of development belongs specially to biology. That of the inverse order isi my subject; and my analysis, fixing on facts of consciousness, has to follow them up to the precise point at which the organic phenomena begin, of which they are the causes." (I. 357.) The vagueness which I have just remarked seems to be a con- sequence of M. Renouvier's method. He demarcates the functions by his categories, as we have already seen, and this leads him away from close analysis of the facts; their grouping suffices him. The categories are a real hindrance of analysis. They make the functions for this practical purpose as obstructive as if the operations which they describe were called by the old name of faculties. But this is not their only fault. When we ask how M. Renouvier conceives the Qausal action of states of consciousness upon the organism, or how he would describe, even in quite general terms, the mode of its operation, a question which must be asked and answered before we can conceive the action as a reality, we get no reply whatever from him, any more than from others; all alike are in total darkness on the point. What we get instead is a statement of the true way of conceiving the</page><page sequence="11">A. Renouvier's Philosophy.-Psychology. 183 notion of causality; and that is a very different thing. It is true that, " When the order of sequence of two acts is clearly perceived and de- fined, e.g., from an organic to an emotional function, or reciprocally, we may give the iname of cause to antecedents of either kind, and that of effect to the consequents. That is saying that a force is interposed between these acts, in such a way, that the one occurs when the other is given. But this force is distinctly not a virtue which passes from one subject" [meaning ens] " to another, to inform it, which is an unintelligible hypothesis; neither is it the immanent evolution of an unique subject and that subject's acts, without anything new, original, and irreducible coming in; but it is the result of the harmonic unity of the phenomena included in development (dans le devenir), or of a law above which we are totally unable to posit anything intelligible ". (I. 353-4.) In admitting, as I have admitted, that this last sentence is true, I do not include M. Renouvier's interpretation of it, namely, that his category of causality is the true expression of the general term " harmonic unity ". We may use the term causation for the relation of conditioning and conditioned. And if the facts permitted, we might call a state of consciousness the cause of a state of nerve, just as properly as vice versa. But the facts do not permit it, and to this M. Renouvier, like so many others, is blind. It is not enough to say, as he and others do, that we do not know even in the most general way, how consciousness depends on states, or movements, of organism, as if that was sufficient to establish a parallel with our ignorance how states, or movements, of organism can depend on consciousness. There is this further fact, that we know organisms existing (apparently at least) without consciousness; but we have no knowledge of states of consciousness floating free without organisms. Until it is shown that there are, in the organism, states of conscious- ness which are not dependent on innervation, the presumption is in favour of subsequent states of consciousness depending, not on prior states of consciousness, but on innervations underlying the prior states of consciousness. Innervations are thus conceived as conditioned and determined by innervations, and not by states of consciousness; and the states of consciou,ness which accom- pany them are conceived as depending throughout, not on each other, but on the sequence of the innervations. We can indeed analyse the sequence of states of consciousness, and discover their general laws, but the causation which determines them is in the laws of the underlying innervations. Take the case for example of a musical phrase being heard and exciting the vocal organs to reproduce it. We dwell upon the pleasure of the sounds, it is said, and the feeling of pleasure alone accounts for our dwelling on them. We then try to sing them, and here again the wish to hear them repeated determines</page><page sequence="12">184 M. Renotuvier's Philosophy.-Psychology. the effort. Thirdly, we may succeed more or less in the repro- duction, but here again the perception of the likeness or unlike- ness of the sounds produced to those originally heard guides us in the tentative efforts we make. It thus appears as if three states of consciousness as such, a feeling, a wish, a perception, are necessary conditions of our singing the phrase. But it is forgotten that each of these states of consciousness has its under- lying state of innervation. The, presumption surely is, that the innervation underlying the feeling of pleasure in the sounds originally heard is different from, being a modification of, the innervation underlying the mere perception of the sounds with- out such pleasure. Its action upon the innervation of the vocal organs must therefore likewise be different. So again the wis7h to hear the sounds again has its own modification of innervation, different from that of the mere pleasure of hearing, still more different from that of the mere perception. The same may be said of the third state of consciousness, the perception of the like- ness or unlikeness which is said to guide our tentative efforts, which, as combined with the pleasure and the wish, is different from a mere perception of likeness and unlikeness. It may, and indeed mlust, on this theory be held, that, if everything re- mained the same in the innervation, and the consciousness alone was suppressed, without altering the underlying modifications of the innervation, then the musical phrase originally conveyed to the ear would stimulate the vocal organs as before, and would be reproduced by the organism just the same as when conscious- ness accompanied its action. If it is objected that this theory, logically throws on the sole shoulders of physical agency the enormous buetden of accounting for all the facts of evolution and design in nature, all the phen- omena of vital, conscious, instinctive, and social development, I think there needs be no hesitation in admitting it. It is thorough-going materialism within the limits of science, but not beyond, and that is the important point for philosophy. Con- sciousness is the final cause, the rc'Xos', of all matter. That con- sciousness of a particular kind should arise in it, is the purpose which it serves. Consciousness is also that out of which it arose --how we cannot construe to thought, because our ideas of modes of causation are all derived from matter, and presuppose its existence. It is only within a material world that real effi- cient causation, meaning always by this phrase the phenomenal conditioning of one thing by another, is scientifically intelligible. Non-material causation is a cadre which we have no means of filling up. But science may fairly hope some day to be able to give the differentia of the various forces or modes of motioli characterised as mechanical, chemical, vital, and vital with con</page><page sequence="13">A!:J Renzovier's Phi,losohy.-Psychology. 185 sciousness, with the potentialities of which matter was endowed, when it first rose as an island in the ocean of consciousness, destined to contribute in some special manner to the develop- ment of its matrix. Matter springs out of consciousness and works towards consciousness again. Why, then, need we hesitate to, admit that its forces are by themselves competent to the work which consciousness originally imposed upon them ? I dwell on this point at great but I hope not tedious length, because it is the first and most essential point to be determined by any psychologist who rejects the "entity" theory of soul. Psychology being a science, aiming at establishing causal d&amp;- pendences, and not merely like metaphysic, or M. Renouvier's General Logic, at subjective analysis of consciousness,-where, it must be demanded of the psychologist, where does he place his real nexus of causation ? ' In the states of consciousness ? or in the innervation ? or now in one, now in the other ? or in both at once ? If now in one, now in the other, or in both at once, then what -sort of nexus is it imagined to be? We know the sort of nexus in innervation; we know what is supposed to be the nexus--in the " faculties " of the entity; but a mixture of both is unintelligible, and a causal nexus between states of con- sciousness, as such, derives all its plausibility from supposed mental forces underlying the phenomenal states of consciousness. Several psychologists of the empirical school have thouglht it possible to psychologise without a prior hypothesis on this fundamental question. They have thought it feasible to leave the agent or Subject in the state of an unknown somethaniq, an x so to speak; to have their thoughts a chaos on the point; to have no opinion as to where the real causative nexus in con- sciousness lies. They are content with reoistering and classify' ing the facts. If this course were strictly and consistently adhered to, psychology would establish no other than merely empirical laws, as they are called; that is, general facts not re- ferred to the causal nexus which groups them, like Kepler's laws until connected with the law of gravitation, or like nominal in contrast to real definition. When more than this is aimed at, yet without a prior hypo- thesis as to the causative agency, the result is merely to substi- tute final for efficient cause at the critical moment. When, for instance, we say that a sense of pleasure stimulates action by which we retain it and dwell on it, as when an agreeable warmth prompts a movement towards the hearth, the pleasurable sen- sation which is put forward as a real link in the chain of events, and therefore in the character of an efficient cause in action and re-action with states of innervation, is really a final cause, not an efficient one. That is to say, it renders intelligible to tus, the 13</page><page sequence="14">186 M. Renouvier's Philosophy.-1'sychology. spectators, the action of movement towards the hearth, by making it look reasonable; but it gives no account of how pleasurable sensation acts efficiently on nerve. It is not pre- tended that it is a final cause to the agent, for it is precisely in spontaneous aQtions, actions below voilition, that it is brought forward as an explanation. What is a final cause to spectators is put forward as an efficient cause to thA agent. On this subreption of final cause, in the place of efficient, a very large part of empirical psychology at the present day depends. Empirical psychologists who are not " conscious automatists " are in the dilemma of either going back to the " soul and its faculties," or else of building their science on " final causes " We shall now undeirstand M. Renouvier's position. It is a far better one than that of those empirical psychologists I have spoken of. He boldly adopts final causes as efficient in adopting the categories. A category of final cause means final cause as an ultimate and irreducible law of thought, constitutive of the uni- verse. After that, there is no difficulty. If consciousness does not appear always as efficient, as, e.g., in -Volition, still its action can be subsumed under the case of reasonable actions for ends, as they appear to spectators; spectators can bring them under the category; and the category admits no further question. His theory is sufficient, consistent, intrepid, and illusory. That of the empirical psychologists is illusory only. I now come to a point introductory to M. Renouvier's theory of volition, I mean his view of what are called the laws of associ- ation. Here again there is a-certain similarity, and at the same time a difference, between his views and those of the associa- tionists. The similarity lies in the method, the difference in the result. Like them, M. Renouvier does not see the advantage, perhaps I might say the necessity, of strictly distinguishing the spontaneous action of the conscious being from his action as governed either -by sensation from without or by volition from within. He does not ask in what ways it is the tendency of the conscious being to act, when left solely to his own prompt- ings, isolated, at any given momeit, from further influence of the external world, and previous to the arising of volition in consequence of the train of thoughts and feelings which then spontaneously occur to him. If any specific laws of this spoIn- taneous action (spontaneous redintegration, as I have terrmed it, from Sir W. Hamilton's establishmient of redintegration as its primary law) could be discovered, it would lead us into the very heart of the conscious agent's nature. But as the question is usually treated, and as it is treated by M. Renouvier, the very possibility of there being any spontaneouas tendencies in redinte-</page><page sequence="15">M. Renouvier's Philosophy.-Psy&amp;holoky. 187 gration is ignored-, inasmuch as the distinction and isclation of the state to be examined is neglected. Contiguity and similarity, *hich are commonly assigned as the laws of association, have yet to make good their claim to be laws of spontaneous redintegration. If they were the only laws of association, they would be incompatible with any theory but the tabula rasa theory of the mind, inasmuch as they express solely the influence exerted on the mind by experience. The difference, therefore, between M. Renouvier and the association- ists, from' -this point of view, is not an important one; for he includes all the laws of association under the one word habit, notwithstanding that this term covers with him a very different content from theirs, and first and foremost the categories them- selves. (I. 130.) The mechanism of the mind itself together with its experience is what M. Renouvier means ,by habit, his objection to the associationists being this that they make this mechanism the product of experience alone. (I. 243, Obs.) His view is briefly this: "When the train of thought has not its immediate origin in the functions of consciousness guided by emotion or by will, it is from habit that it results; and this case is very common, as much for man as for animals. But I shall treat elsewhere of the law of habit. Here it is enough to lay down as a fact, that thought reproduces itself, by a spontaneous movement, in that order, whatever it be, which is once given or repeated, though primitively due either- to experience, or emotion, or reflection, or will." (I. 132-3.) Association of ideas thus belongs,7according to M. Renouvier, to the lower group of functions, though receiving acquisitions from the higher, and i- entirely dependent on habit, whatever may be the source of the ideas associated, the re-active power of the mind beginning only with reflection, emotion, and will. He denies what seems to me a real initiative taken by conscious agents at the point of spontaneous redintegration, but makes up for this denial, as we shall presently see, by placing an initiative of a very different kind at another point, namely, at the moment of conscious volition. At length we reach M. Renouvier's theory of Will and emotion, which leads directly to his theory of liberty, the central doctrine of the whole book, being the chief foundation of Certitude. The theory of will constitutes the psychological basis of that of liberty, its other basis consisting in certain metaphysical or logi- cal conceptions. The two functions of will and emotion (by which latter word I throughout this article translate M. Renou- vier's passion) are defined respectively by the categories of causation and 'final-causation. As to emotion:</page><page sequence="16">188 M. Renouvier's Philosophy.-Psychblogy. "Every emotion exists on condition of an end propose'd; and with the ends the emotions vary, as sensations vary with their causes. The ends being laid down in consciousness itself, which cannot be said of the causes of sensations, analysis can base the nomenclature of the emotions on that of their ends.'" (I. 250.) The will has a separate basis and a separate existence from emotion: " When we look at the function of will directly, and define it by the c4tegory of force or causality, -which bi-nds facts by subjecting them to a law of constant sequence, we see nothing in it which necessarily implies attraction or preference or pleasurable feeling of any kind. Following this route which is beyond suspicion (irrdprochable), it is difficult to compre- hend so many philosophers identifying will with desire. Envisage this latter emotion by itself, it will appear no less-distinct. It is enough to remark, that desire may arise for an object of which we do not know whether it be realisable, and that it may continue without being followed by any effect either external or in consciousness only. In contrast to this, the name of will has never been given but to representations joined to the effort of an act which aims at realising an object internal or external, and followed by those consequLences of the act which nature permits. If it were not so, would all men clearly understand that we can desire involun- tarily, and can will without desiring;-and can we deny that they do so understand?" (1. 226-7.) I for one delny it unhesitatingly, in the sense in which desire and will are used in this passage, thouLgh there is a vague sense in which it is undeniable. When in common parlance we speak of willing without desiring, we mean willing what is not pleasant except as it is desirable to do a painful duty or deny ourselves a.gratification. And besides, if more.than this was meant by common parlance, it would cut the ground from M. iRenouvier's description of the will as "representations joined to the effort of an act which aims at realising an object internal or external". To aim at realising anything involves desiring its realisation. Lingering a little on this description of the will, let us ask at what point of the phrase just quoted M. Renouvier finds its real characteristic. The niame of will is clearly given to repre- sentations of a certain kind. But are they representations of an act which aimns at realising something? Or are they representa- tions of the abstract efort involved in such acts ? It cannot be the first, for that would take the will out of dependence. on the category of causality, and make it depend on that of final causa- tion, by involving a final cause in the definition, of will. It must therefore be abstract effort that M. Renouvier identifies with will, supposing him to accept this description as true; and abstract effort, with its existence guaranteed by a category of thought, is an abstract " entity," if ever there was one. How there can be will without desire is, I must confess, to</page><page sequence="17">M. 1enouvCier's Philosophy.-Psychblogy. 189 me inconceivable. True, the element of efort is distinguishable in all such cases of desire as are also cases of will; you can have desire without that effort, but you cannot have the effort without desire; effort is an element in the total which cannot exist separately. It cannot be defined but by the end which the total state of consciousness aims at, that is, either objectively by the object desired, or- subjectively b-y the gratification -of the 'desire. As a phenomenist M. Renouvier ought to 'hold, that the effort in volition is what it is known as. Now it is known only as feeling. But M. iRenouvier bases it on the category- of causality, an irreducible law of thought, and therefore he assigns to it, as he logically must, a reality corresponding to the law, quite irrespective of the -phenormenal feeling, the sense of effort in volition. Let us now turn to the formal definition whiich M. Renouvier gives of volition, and of will as the general term embracing the particular acts, in the chapter entitled " Man as will, or auto- motive representation ". He begins by premising as a truth of experience, " an appearance but an incontestable one," that "In the course of the representations which group themselves or form sequences, constituting what we are when we think we have the direction of ourselves, we especially identify our consciousness with that representa- tion which at each moment seems to come up (se produire) without previous efficient cause, that is to say, which seems first to cause itself, then to de- termine the other representations." (I. 296-7.) After enlarging on facts of this kind comes the formal defini- tion: "I understand by volition the character of an act of consciousness which represents itself, not as simply given, but as being able, or having been able, to be, or not to be, aroused or continued, without any other apparent change than that which is connected with the representation itself in its sumnIoning or averting the representation." (I. 301.) This definition, he says, though it may seem obscure, yet ex- presses the actual fact, and in connexion with the fact we must understand it; " we are at the nodus of human consciousness ". It is not difficult to see what is the fact intended; it is the fact known as the sense offreedom ; this is the fact which supplies M. Renouvier with his definition of the will. As he himself says, a few pages farther on: " In defining the will, I have defined liberty, since liberty is a potency (puissance), and I have not considered the will otherwise, nor yet out of consciousness, or elsewhere than in man. . . . The question relates to the potentiality of future events, evidenced in certain representations, evi- denced as ambiguous according to all appearance, and' becoming a volition in the act of representation which resolves itself and determines itself among several possibles. TlThere is nothing but analysis in that." (I. 306).</page><page sequence="18">190 t. Renouvier's Philosophy-.-&lt;-Psychology. Again, in the chapter on the relation between the higher states of consciousness and muscular movements, from which I have already quoted in another connexion, he thus returns to the will: "We have envisaged the will in its own proper theatre, when it is seen at the origin of all and each of the ramnifications of the trains of reflective thought in man. We could not give an account of the function by which it projects, connects, and varies its acts, when believing itself free, unless we characterised the representation as voluntary, and as capable of sum- moning, sustaining, and suspending itself, in the midst of that matter of ends and images which instinct and experience accumulate for it, and from which it borrows its elements. That is the real and true place occupied- by the will.'" (I. 395). Observe now this last touch in conclusion: " This theory brings to unity the system of relations between representa- tions and movements, and raises into another sphere the fact of volition properly so called, sign or fact corresponding to which biology can discover sone in her domain. It is very different with sensations, emotions, and imaginations." (I. 396-7). The italics are mine. I wish to emphasise the point they indicate, in order to show the close similarity between M. Renouvier's theory and what may be called ego theories and soul theories. There is held in all alike a supra-physical creative agency, making new beginnings and interrupting the continuity of events (I. 304); but in M. Renouvier's theory, this agency resides in and is exercised by states of consciousness, self-caused or automotive representations, and has its reality guaranteed by the category of causation. That is what is distinctive of his theory; and it is a distinction which, though real, is yet not enough, in my opinion, to justify his theory, in respect of the point now under discussion, being called phenomenism, if the others are stigmatised as absolutism. Categories, as irreducible laws of thought, are pro tanto destructive of its phenomenist character. Here would be the place, if I could attempt to give a com- plete account of M. IRenouvier's work, to mention the various collateral gpeculations which group themselves round -the main line of thought; the-nature of life, for instance, the presence of final cause in nature, the conception of an universal philosophical language, and especially what is perhaps the most valuable, as it is the most prominent, feature of all, the theory of mental and moral vertige, the yielding and abandonment of consciousness to its lower impulses, letting go. its hold on the promptings of reason and will; in connexion with phenomena which are shown to be of kindred origin, such as double personality, sleep, sleep-walking, and so-called mesmeric influence. Gladly would I dwell upon M. Renouvier's warm advocacy of, all that contributes, to real</page><page sequence="19">ut R-enoutvier's Philosophy.-Psychology. 191 dignity and independence of character, especially in education, in connexion with his theory, on these topics; a point which comes out most prominently perhaps in his criticism of Pascal (II. 41-8). But to go through all this, or attempt to mention the many profound and luminous remarks with which the whole work is strewn, would be impossible without trenching on the space, already too small, for following out the main current of the theory. Keeping then to that current, I come at once tosthe question which is the staple of all M. Rentouvier's speculation, -the question of Free-will. And here I will begin with a remark of M. Renouvier's, which stands with him at the opening of the subject; it is that in England, where, he pays us the compliment of saying, the education of the will is perhaps somewhat more advanced than on the continent, the men of thought are almost without excep- tion determinists, while on the contrary " those peoples whose diploma'd philosophers and whose theologians (of the Jesuit school) vie with each other in teaching a nominal free-will, find interposed between them alnd practical liberty the obstacle of a priesthood and a government, instituted as they believe by this liberty, but always for its destruction" (II. 51-54). It seems, then, that the fruit of maintaining a nominal free-will is despotism, that of denying it liberty. Let us see what kind of free-will M. Renouvier maintains. M. Renouvier's handling of Liberty falls naturally into three portions, (1) in connexion with its basis, the will; (2) in con- nexion with certitude, of which it is a basis; (3) in connexioli with indeterminism or real contingency as a general fact of existence as a whole, which takes us up into the higrhest and most problematic region of philosophy. To begin wit"h the first of these. The position which he assigns to his own doctrine is that of a- mean between two opposite errors, indifferentism, or the tenet of the so-called liberty of indifference, on one side, and deter- minism on the other. Both theories, he says, require the notion of a separable will, a will separable from the representations in which it is manifested. Such a will must be conceived as in itself wholly indifferent to any motives or any decision. But this separation of a " pure will " being really a chimera, the de- terminists easily show,-as against the indifferentists, that willing is the moment of preponderance of one motive over others, the place of the pure will being taken by a mathematical point, and the image of a-balaice of motives being introduced. (II. 63-73). He then proceeds: "The liberty which wee can admit is that character of a reflective and voluntary human act, in which consciousness posits in close union the</page><page sequence="20">192 M.B Renouvier's Philosophy.--Psyeholoqqy motive and the motor identified with herself, while affirming that other acts, exclusive of that first mentioned, were possible at the same instant. This possibility, whether apparent only or real also, is the most distinct title of liberty, the clearest element in its definition." (II. 7-3-4.) Let us now see how this is worked out and justified. How does he conceive the identification of motive and motor witlh each other and with consciousness, at the moment of volition ? Just above, in criticising determinism, he had said: "Deny that beyond the passive and received impressions, in deliberation properly so called, there ever arises a motive into which that which is called will does not already enter as an element; affirm that, in such cases a motive is always a willed motive, that is to say, now summoned (JvoquJ) among other motives equally possible ;-and the determinist argument is at once upset." (II. 71.) Again he speaks of free acts as not being uncaused; "their cause is the man, in the totality and plenitude of his functions ". (II., p. 86.) Determinists, in my opinion, need not hesitate to follow M. Renouvier in both these statements, and yet keep their deter- minism intact. The question is, what is "' that which 'is called will," and how does it enter as an element into motives? It is not necessary for determinists, as M. iRenouvier imagines, to hold that all the mnotives which they speak of in their image of the balance are motives externally impressed on the deliberating agent (however defined) at the moment of action, that the agent vanishes to a point, and exists only " to yield to communicated movements ". (I. 69.) On the contrary, the agent at the moment of deliberation is a concrete being, capable of re-acting as well as being acted on, of moulding his motives as much as they mould him. The nature and character of that re-action and moulding of motives is the question' at issue. The point insisted on as essential by determinists is the subjection of the re-action (as well as the action) to law. But, says M. iRenouvier, "Qui dit IQi, entend n6cessite'. Bien de plus vrat et de plus Iitime." There it seems to me is his mistake. By necessity he means compulsion. But there are many determinists who do not use either necessity or law in that sense. Now it is M. Renouvier's theory of the will (" in defining the will I have defined liberty ") that determines the sense of the statements quoted. When he says that the will enters into a motive as element, he means that an agency, the reality of which is guaranteed by a category, begins a new series of events in the world, appearing in the form of a self-caused representation, a mzotif acutomoteur. (II. 72.) I have already said that this theory seems to be as ontological in character as anything can be. It is also wholly unconstruable to thought.'" It contains three</page><page sequence="21">M. 1?enouvier's Philosophy. -Psychology. 193 unintelligibles; first, the notion of an absolutely new commence- ment; secondly, that of a -causa sui, a thing which causes itself to begin to be; and thirdly, that of real contingency, which we shall come to consider in its place. If the free agenoy of man, " man in-the totality and plenitude of his functions" could be established only by a theory like this, its case would be desperate indeed. M. Renouvier imagines that all determinists are of one school, th'at they either deny free-will, or may be logically compelled to deny it on -their own premisses. He forgets that, from the, time of Leibniz at any rate, there has been a school of determinists who maintain free-will, though insisting at the same time on the universality of law, the uniformity of, nature. Previously there had been but two conflicting views generally current, that of free-will' and that of necessity. Those. were necessarians who, defining liberty as the absence of external compulsion, denied it of the will, which they held was always constrained by some- thina external to itself. But Leibniz, by opposing necessity to logical contingency, distinguished it as a logical category from compulsion, which was an efficient agency; which distinction is the true note of determinism,- and justifies the name as disti-n- guished from necessarianism. On this basis, though he did not work it out to full clearness, Leibniz propounded the theory of ,the determination of the will by the nature of the agent in con- junction with motives; by which he at one stroke based its freedom on logical, not real, contingency, and distinguished this freedom from what he called " liberty of indifference ". Leibniz and those who agree with him may be called free-will deter- minists, to distinguish them either from necessarians or from compulsory determinists. Indeterminists on the other hand are those who, holding free-will, base it not upon a merely logical, but upon a real contingency or indetermination. Of this number is M. Renouvier. It is not, I think, difficult to show that free-will is perfectly compatible with determinism. The beginning of the whole question is the sense of freedom, and its relation to real freedom, with which it must not, be con- founded. But the mode of distingushing the two must be attended to. The sense of freedom in deliberati-ng, choosing, and deciding, is not distinguished from real freedom as testimony is distinguished from- the thing testified, so that the two are separable from each other; but as a subjective aspect is dis- tinguished from its objective aspect, e.g., the Berkeleyan sensa- tions and ideas of matter from matter itself. Both aspects are equally real and equally true. The question is, what they import.,</page><page sequence="22">194 M. Renouvier's Philosophy.-Psychology. In judging of this, we must fix our view on the subjective aspect, the senise of freedom, for that is what real freedom is known as; which is an obvious phenomenist canon. Here comes in that other cardinal distinction in philosophy, which is through- out neglected by M. Renouvier, who puts his categories in its stead, as I showed in my former article; I mean the distinction of percept and concept. The sense of freedom (and consequently real freedom) is a percept,-a percept in what I have elsewhere called primary consciousness, entering into reflection, but not yet made into a concept. We perceive ourselves in the act of deciding, before perceiving ourselves decided. The uncertainty attaching to the fact of inchoateness in the act of deciding is what gives us the sense of freedom; of which the inchoateness itself is the reality. Now all such acts, when looked at as completed and making parts of a train of events, are looked at as concepts, or rather as percepts in direct consciousness (as I have called it elsewhere), thle formation of which depends on conception. We have before uis no longer the act per se, as it looked while going on, but we have before us the completed act, in connexion with what pre- ceded and with what is to follow it. When we put the question, whether acts looked at in this second way are really free or really necessitated, the answer must be, necessitated. An actioni is an agent in motion; a completed motion is a determined act, an act determined by the agent itself. To call coipleted acts, acts looked at in this second way, free (as in saying that some completed acts are free and others necessitated), is to introduce a contradiction into the free acts and into the very notion of freedom, by supposing it free and fixed at the same time and in the same respect. Now what M. Renouvier does, in common, I muist confess, with the great majority, is this: he opposes liberty and necessity as mutually exclusive, which they are only when said of events taken in this second way, as concepts, or as completed events and parts of a series. Only one of the two contradictories can then be true of them, and M. Renouvier contends that, in mainy cases, it is liberty. Determiniists contend that it is always necessity; and this is not contradictory to, but rather presupposes, the reality of freedom and the sense of freedom, said of those same events in their inchoate state, or said of man wlhile acting. It will, I suppose, be objected, that this theory re(luces the freedom of man to the level of that of stones or billiard-balls, the things usually taken as types of necessity. But this objec- tioni arises from the separatist prejudice of seeing in the universe a mere collection of individual objects or groups of objects, each of which has a rounded-off nature of its own, wholly apart from</page><page sequence="23">MA Renouvier's Philoso.py*-.-Psychology. 195 that of others. Abandon this piece of superficiality; and there is nothing lowering "to man in the present theory. Freedom alone is the same in all things, and common to all; the differences lie in the different phenomena with which it is accompanied, in the various degrees of richness, complexity, and -moral value, of the free agents, man being at the head of the scale. "To every Form of being is assigned. An active Principle.- This lIs the freedom of the universe."' Observe, to every form. And why ? Because the character of inchoateness attaches to all action, to everything that occupies duration of time. Hence the significance of the remark made above, that M. Renouvier overlooked the initiative taken by the organism in spontaneous redintegration, and replaced it by an initiative of a different kind, a wholly new commencement, at a further point, namely, volition. The organism is always re-acting on its im- pressions. Without re-action there would be no perception, the threshold of consciousness would never be reached; without re- action there would arise no trains of images or feelings in the organism left to itself; and without re-action agrain, this time accompanied by sense of effort, there would be no voluntary ,direction of the spontaneous trains. This last re-action is the most marked of all, we are conscious of it for itself; it is a turning point often (not always) slowly reached but instantly followed by rapid and often vigorous energy' a moment marked by the decisive " I will " or " I won't ". This character of decision distinguishes volition from desire, out of which it arises and to which it gives effect. Two further remarks are requisite on the conception of freedom which I have now put forth. The first is, that it affords a basis for free will, corresponding to and replacing the conception of a free creative and self-originated power held by indetermiinists. So that I 'am enabled to go beyond the view of perhaps the majority of determinists, compulsory determinists as 1 have called them, who define human freedom as a man's power to do as he pleases, implying that he can never please as he pleases, but that, though he does as he pleases, he pleases as he must; that is, deny the freedom of the act of choice. Now this arises from their looking at acts as completed events, and in connexion with others, to the neglect of their inchoate character; looking at them, in fact, in the very same way as the indeter- inists do; only that then they deny, and very truly, that acts 1'Wordsworth. - The Excursion, Book IX. 1.</page><page sequence="24">196 A. BRenouvier's -Philosophy.-Psychology, of choice are any exception to the law of uniform causation, while the indeterminists invent a peculiar power or faculty.of liberty, in order to take them out of that law. But consider steadily for a moment the phrase, cannot please as he pleases; for it opens a door into the very heart of the puzzle of this question. It covers two very different senses; (a) that a man cannot please as he does please, which is a contradiction in terms; and this of course is not the sense in which the phrase is used or implied by determinists; and (b) that, though the deed is determined by his choice, his 6hoice is determined by some other conditions, which is the truth. But mark that here the act of choice is considered, not by itself, but in connexion with conditions, separate from it in thought, just as the deed, which is one thing, depends on the choice, which is another. Look, however, at the act of choice by itself, as in sense (a), and then I hold that, the contradictory of sense (a) being true, (namely, that a man can please as he pleases), and pleasing or choosing being therefore the ultimate fact upon the analysis of which the whole question hangs, the act of choice is an act in which iman becomes conscious of the freedom or activity which he shares, in Wordsworth's language, with "every form of being". The freedom of the act of choice thus depends upon the agent of the will being something concrete or empiri- cal, exercising a re-action, and not being empty of content and therefore imaginable as wholly or passively determined by ex- ternal agents, which is the doctrine of the compulsory determin- ists. The second remark is, that the basis spoken of is a basis only. It does not prevent us, when a further supposition is introduced, from distinguishing some acts as free and others as compulsory; for instance, when we speak of a man as being the slave of his passions, or on the other hand when the " service " of the highest ideal is spoken of as " perfect freedom ". In all such cases, we are no longer speaking of man's freedom generally, or as a whole, but we are introducing a further supposition'; we are identifying the mian with one part of his nature as distinguished 'from another part, in the two cases mentioned with a higher part as distinguished from a lower, or what is the same thing, with one set of motives as distinguished from another set. Either part, either set of motives, may dominate the other; and then the part domainating is free, and the part dominated is brQught into sub- jection. But in either case, the acts of the man are free, in the fundamental sense of the term, and the distinction introduced is aL distinction, not between freedom and necessity, but between freedom and subjection, which givres the 'term freedom a very different sense, namely,.that of freedom from external compulsion;</page><page sequence="25">M. Renouvier's Philosop/iy.-Psychdlogy. 197 this conception, at the same time, being no longer restricted to the man's outward acts, as the compulsory determinists hold, but extended and applied to his inward acts of choice as wpll. Briefly, then, to sum up the position of the free-will determin- ists. There are two senses of freedom, (1) freedom from law, (2) freedom from compulsion. The act of choice is often free from compulsion, is so always indeed, so far as it is strictly an act of choice, choice implying this freedom. It is never free from law, the laws namely of the agent's own, nature and those of his en- vironment. But in saying this it must be remembered, that we are regarding the act of choice as a completed act, as a member in a chain of conditions, and we are abstracting from that moment of inchoateness, in virtue of which when regarded alone, as it is in the instant of choosing, every act appears to be free in every sense, even from law. Observe that- this moment of inchoateness is the central point of the whole theory, and that which gives it unity. For on this moment of inchoateness depends, as we shall presently see, that sense of freedom which is also a sense of power; our ignorance of the law (which nevertheless really exists) enabling us to feel our own energy (which obeys it) not as law but as energy. Which is saying in other words, that our sense of freedom from compulsion, which is real freedom, depends on our- momentary imagination of the absence of any liniit whatever. I pass over the collateral support which M. Renouvier attempts to derive for his thesis of libert.y from the doctriine of chances, his examination of the " loi dite desgrands nombres"; I pass over his criticism of J. S. Mill; his reply to M. Proudhon; and the many acute remarks interspersed everywhere in his pages. I repeat what I said in my former article, that refutation is in no wise my object, but rather to exhibit the main outlines of his system, with the main distinctive principles upon which it rests; pointing out nevertheless some cases where it seems to derogate from its own avowed character of Phenomenism, in cone sequence of the introduction of irreducible categories, or laws of thought. One point, however, ought not to be passed in silence, which is the acutely stated argument for real liberty drawn from the moral law. And this will form the natural transition to the second branch of the subject, liberty as a basis of certitude. " If everything is necessary," says M. Renouvier, " then moral judg- ments, the notions of right and of duty, have no foundation in the nature of things ". And this he proceeds to develop: " There cannot have existed a duty to do that which the event has shown to be impossible ; there cannot have existed a right of demanding what the event has declared was not to be. We are in fact admitting " [by holding</page><page sequence="26">198 .A Renouvier's Philosophy.-.--Psychology. necessity] " that the oniy possibles among imagined futures are those which are realised. Therefore there is no right, no duty, in the past, be- yond that which was and which is. Therefore, also, no right, no duty in the present, for it may well be that our ignorance enables emotion to attach itself to what is impossible, and judge it to be good, or the imagination to construiet a, more satisfactory order than that of experience; but it cannot make the impossible exigible." (II. 58.) "There cannot have existed a duty,,' &amp;c.-Surely there can, if the agent who is the subject of the duty is himself the cause of its impossibility. The discrepancy between the agent's own moral ideal and his own act is what his conscience reproaches him with; and the sense of that discrepancy is the very essence of a reproving conscience. In the words of a verv close and subtil observer of these matters, " the good that I would I do niot: but the evil which I would not, that I do ". (Rorm. vii. 19.) And the agent identifies himself with his ideal and not with his act, distinguishes his true self from his actual but (as he hopes) temporary self, so long as he listens to the voice of conscience. M. Renouvier is tacitly supposing that the impossibility is imposed on the agent from without; as if it were a case of im- prisonment, and the prisoner reproached for not escaping. He treats the case of freedomn to choose as if it were a case of freedomn to do what we choose, the hindrances to which latter are external. Now necessity includes not onlv necessity imposed on one thing by another thing, but also necessity in the action of a thing con- sidered by itself. Thus, though all action is alike free, namely, in its inchoateness, yet all is alike subject to law, and therefore necessary. During the inchoateness of an act of choice, the agent represents both alternatives as possible; that is, he is un- certain of the relative strength of his own motives; the comple- tion of the act of choice alone shows what that relative strength really was in the given case. I remark also, that the agent's representation of both alternatives as possible is not the subjec- tive aspect of their being both really possible, but is the objective aspect of the agent's feeling of uncertainty about them. Sense of freedomn,-objective aspect, inchoateness; sense of uncertainty, -objective aspect, representation of alternatives as equally possible. M. Renouvier returns to the charge in the third Part: " If, of two acts between which we balance, one only was possible in reality, the moral law, which At the moment should command the act which necessarily will be, and forbid the one which necessarily wtill not be,- or which should command the one which will not be and forbid that which will;-that mioral law would be a vain, ridiculous, fantastic, or odioLis injunction, according to the kind of autho6rity which was attributed to it." (III. 164-5.) Not at all. Another feature of the moral law is here missed,</page><page sequence="27">M. Benouvier's Philosophy.-Psychology. 199 besides its intimateness as just noticed. The moral law contains its motive in itself; it is an ideal which has attractive power, and aids in its own fulfilment. If not obeyed now, it may be edxt timel; the effort to obey it, fruitless now, bears fruit in the future. And still more is this the case, if it is efficacious to pro- duce obedience now. M. Renouvier is supposing that the moral law is like the decree of a sovereign, to be obeyed or disobeyed by a subject, only without the sanctions which give it efflicacity. Moral law is not merely civil law minus sanction. I cannot think that M. Renouvier shows his wonted subtilty in these objections, which involve a complete departure from his own strongly urged principle of regarding man as a concrete agent, " in the totality and plenitude of his functions," and introduce him as an abstract entity. They are arrows from the scholastic quiver. When therefore he says, that " the belief in the real contin- gency (amibiguitef) of future events is a condition of the moral function of consciousness,"- (1I. 165), that is, of conscience, I see in this, not a demonstrated fact, but a statement of that errone- ous mode of distinction between sense of freedom and real freedom which I have noted above. Conscience does not require for its operation a belief in real contingency; it requires a perception of real freedom. It does not rest on a belief which may be errone- ous, and at any rate demands independent proof. It has nothing to do, so far as its basis is concerned, either with the doctrine of contingency or with that of necessity; nothing to hope from the one, nothing to fear from the other. When M. Renouvier, touching as he thinks the very core of the question, demands that we shall judge the determinist theory by asking what actions would result, if the agent were to decide - with the distinct and constant conviction in his mind, that he can do at each instant only what he does, can will only what he wills, can desire only what he desires" (II., p. 325) ;-the sup- position involves an act-nal impossibility. In cases of choice, up to the very-moment of decision, the action being yet inchoate, the agent's position is that forward-looking attitude of mind which is uncertain, and represents opposite alternatives as alike possible. Up to the moment of decision he cannot have tLe conviction that he can do only what he does, &amp;c.; because as yet he is doing nothing, his,doing is still future, inchoate up to the moment of decision. He may indeed pause to reflect, that what he will do will be only what he could do; but then what lhe coutld do is the very thiing Which he does not know, which his choice, still pending, is about to decide. He may, I say, pause to interpose that reflection-; but in so reflecting he abandons the simply forward-looking attitude of mind, and adopts the position</page><page sequence="28">200 M. Renouvier's -Philosop hy.-Psychology. of a. spectator ab extra, looking through the spectacles of a general truth; from which position he returns before making his choice. It is impossible for him to adopt both positions at once, so as to import into the forward-looking attitude the theoretical knowledge of determinism proper to the position of a spectator. From this forward-looking attitude the sense of freedom is inseparable. And what -is important to notice is this, that the agent's safety lies in keeping strictly to the forward-looking attitude. The sense of freedom is a sense of power; it increases the force of the will in choosing the best course; which is the true meaning of the possunt quia posse videntur. To interpose 'a speculative reflection on the grounds of that freedom and power, even if it be in favour of the free-will doctrine, is to taint and impoverish the act. It is the origin of Casuistry in the bad sense of the term. But this same sense of freedom, which M. Renouvier calls ap- parent freedom and belief of real freedom, is a fact which in truth carries with it real freedom as its own obverse aspect; real free- dom being, according to M. Renouvier, as he frequently states (e.g., II. 61, 89, 322) a doctrine logically indemonstrable, as he holds also the counter doctrine of determinism to be likewise. Deter- minism then, at least in the form which I have now given it, puts real freedom on a firmer basis than the opposite doctrine even professes to do. Fortunately M. Renouvier admits, that this apparent freedom, this mere belief in real freedom, is a sufficient basis for a whole system of morals, jurisprudence, aind politic; to which view we owe what is in my opinion the most valuable fruit of his labours, namely, his great work, the Science de le Morale, as I remarked in-my former article; and this is the "derogation" which I there spoke of. For if merely apparent freedom is a sufficient basis for a full and final system of practi- cal truth, the discussion of its reality remains invested with a speculative interest only, and the speculative interest is sundered from the practical. In my view they are united; and the sense of freedom is a sufficient basis for Ethic just because it is more than mere -appearance and mere belief, in short because it is freedom, the thing itself. Deny the existence of freedom as antithetically opposed to necessity, that is, embrace Determinism, and you eo ipso assert freedom, both as a reality in itself and also as a firig basis of Ethic, requiring no demonstration but that which is given by analysis of the phlenomena. Coming now to the second branch of the subject, the doctrine of Certitude and its foundation in liberty, the immediate sequel of a passage already quoted, as to the dependence of morals on contingency, will show M. Renouvier's conception of the</page><page sequence="29">M. Renouvier's Philosophy.-Psychboloyy. 201 relation between certitude and contingency, which is precisely simlar: "Lastly, if everything is necessary, error is as necessary as truth, and their titles are equal, Iarring the number of men who hold to either of them, which nuumber may change to-morrow. The false is therefore true, inasmuch as necessary, and the true may be false. Madness has nothing against it but its weakness; error, nothing but its inconsistency." (II. 58-9.) Observe, in thefirst place, the pure assumption that, if truth and error agree in being necessary, they agree in everything; that there is no other essential difference between them. Observe, -secondly, the quiet dismissal of a conception which is, I venture to say, essential to phenomnenism, namely, that consistency is the final test of truth. For, if not, something not capable of being iqn consciousness must be supposed, as that with which opinions are to be in harmony. M. Renouvier's argument seems to be:-(1) there must be real contingency, since otherwise there is no difference between truth and error, but (2), if there is real contingeney, thenfree belief is the only test of truth, in matters where doubt is possible, because it alone is a maker, as well as a perceiver, of truth. " We make error and truth in ourselves, by putting ourselves, after free examination, into contradiction or agreement with external realities, the affirmation of which is not necessarily imposed on consciousness." (II. 349.) Perhaps the following passage is the, highest expression of what M. Renouvier claims for liberty in matter of certitude, showing how far in the direction of making truth his theory leads him: " Whatev'er may be the thought of the world around us, concerning any of those truths on which men vary from age to age, and on which they dis- pute, if my conviction is entire, if I hold with all my reason, if I love with all my heart, if I embrace with all my will, the object of my belief,-then the highest degree of certitude is found for me in that which, externally regarded, seems the lowest." (III. 84.) Liberty, it must be remembered, means, by M. Renouvier's definition, thWb freedom of the will in reflective action which is emotional and intellectual as well as volitional. It has always a content of thought and feeling. This he explains at length, by distinguishing the three elements which are found in cases of certitude produced by liberty; for instance: " We cannot affirm anything systematically without some representation of a group of relations as true, nor without an attraction of some sort or other which leads us to engagedin the truth perceived, nor without a deter- mination of the will- which fixes itself at the moment when it might be possible, as it seems, to suspend the judgment, either to seek new motives and reasons, or even to abandon itself simply to the impulses which arise." (II. 136.) 14</page><page sequence="30">202 M1. Renouvier's Philosophy.-Psyclzology. Every truth being formed in this manner, there is evidently- a part of it which is due to our choice and will that it should be true. This brings us to what certitude in itself is; what are its nature and characteristics. For since the will enters for some- thing into all truths that are certain, and the mode in which they are established affects them with a certain volitional character, certitude is in its nature a belief. We hesitate and then decide; it is therefore also founded on preliminary doubt. The necessity of doubting first, and doubting evervthing, is strongly insisted on. Doubt is called the distinguishing characteristic of the cultivated and enlightened mind. " On the contrary the ignorant doubt little; dullards less; madmen never." (II. 152.) That certitude is a belief, is the cardinal point in M. Renou- vier's theory concerning it. It is not opposed to seeing, not opposed to knowing; but seeing and knowing are themselves cases of belief. " We ought to say that we believe we see, and that we believe we know, and always that we believe." (II. 131.) And this is apparently the truth intended, when M. Renouvier says that the central thought of the chapter quoted from is derived from one to whom he acknowledges the deepest obliga- tions, " whom I now must frankly call my master," J. Lequier; and fragments from whose writings, given at considerable length in the present work, are masterpieces of that kind of introspec- tion which consists in tracing back and questioning, tracing back and questioning again, at every conclusion drawn in a train of thought, the validity of the reasons for drawing it. Lequier was a Catholic, but, says M. Renouvier, a very liberal one. His ultimate canon of certitude seems to be this, " We are never sure that there is evidence, but when there is bad faith in doubting ". (II. 177.) And again, " A truth superior to all human imagina- tion and idols: that when one believes with the firmest faith that one possesses truth, one ought to know that one believes it, and not believe that one knows it." (II. 195.) Very good, I reply; there is then, after all, a difference in kind between believing and knowing, since you say we ought to know that we betieve. If knowledge were a species under the genus belief, and not opposed to it as species to species under the genus judgmnent, this difference in kind would be taken away; for we should then have only a greater or less belief that we believe, not a knowledge of it. Now nothing can make the word belief import a greater certainty than the word knowledge. And there- fore the very name, the scholastic name, certititde is suspicious, implying as it does a belief which is also knowledge, and sug- gesting a wish to juggle something out of the less certain into the more certain category. The difference between knowledge and belief is for analysis to ascertain; and here again, in my</page><page sequence="31">M. Renou?vier's Philosophy.-Psychology. 203 opinion, it is the very same defect in analysis as before, that leads M. Renouvier to bring knowledge under belief. I mnean his failing to see the precise mode in which thought grows out of perception; which vitiates, in my opinion, his account of the part due to volition (liberty as he calls it) in establishing beliefs. But before showing how this is, we must follow up M. Renon- vier's distribution of the affirmed phenomena or judgments which fall under certitude. He arranges them under two Orders. Facts of the First Order of Certitude are (1) the general modes of consciousness, memory, personal identity, the reasoning powers, the categories; (2) a phenomenal external world; (3) the existence of men and other living beings; (4) the general laws of the external world organic and inorganic. (II. 235 Sf.) Facts of the Second Order include everything else: "A second order of certitude will embrace the funda- mental decisions not admitted into the first. It will be characterised by the larger place occupied by doubt, emotion, and will, in establishing truth, either by individuals or in the course of history." (II. 320-1.) Doubt and belief apply to all phenomena of both orders, to everything in fact that involves a judgment, or combination of sensations, the existence of which per se, and while they last, not even Pyrrhonists doubt. Doubt attaches in a feeble measure to, judgments of the first order, in a large measure to those of the second; but still so, that, even in the first order, we are com- pelled to recognise " that every affirmation of reflective conscious- ness is subordinated, in consciousness, to the determination to affirm. There is found the explanation, there the leading into captivity of the profound principle of Pyrrhonism." (II. 320.) The classification is not into facts which we can, and facts which we cannot, help believing; but into facts which we have small, and facts which we have great, power of doubting. Every fact waits, for its certitude, on our determination to affirm it; and our determination to affirm it is, as we have seen, a concrete fact made -ip of intelligence, volition, enmotion, inseparably united in reflection. Affirmation of that kind is a belief. Now we come to the point where I said M. Renouvier's analysis appeared to me defective: It is true that volition enters into every affirmation, but it does so without regard'to the con- tent of the affirmation: It has one purpose and only one, namely, to see what is to be seen. It is the effort of attention which we ,give to any object, in order to perceive it clearly and distinctly. This makes all reasoning practical, even though its object is purely theoretical; this single purpose is enough for that. But if any other purpose or interest is combined with the pure effort of attention, this makes the reasoning practical in an additional</page><page sequence="32">204 M. Renouvier's Philosophy.-Psychology. sense; we have then an interest in affirming this rather than that; in this sense it is not true, that volition enters into all affirmations; and this is the sense which M. Renouvier's theory requires. When it is said that volition enters into all affirmation, it is only as constituting it formaly that it does so. The matter affirmed or denied is not affected thereby. But this distinction, which marks off conception, reasoning, and logical affirmation, from perception, is not drawn by M. Renouvier; who, for want of it, attributes far more than its due to volition in forming beliefs, and erects no logical barrier to the wildest attempts that might conceivably be made by enthusiasts to believe as true what they wish to be so. " Bad faith in doubting," when faith is to be kept only to self, is unsound as a criterion of objective truth. Honesty indeed with oneself is an essential requisite; but it is a negative condition only, a sine qua non; we may believe many absurdities honestly. M. Renouvier of course stands perfectly clear of the wish to smuggle foregone conclusions of any kind into philosophy, as the whole tenor of his work shows. What he is looking for is some synthetic principle, over and above the categories, but springing out of them, which shall lead to some particular cosmogony, the categories applying to all alike. He adopts what he thinks is the principle of the Practical Reason, and so far I have no objec- tion to make. But I contend that his analysis of the practical reason is wrong, and wrong in a way which gives an illegitimate scope to volition and desire, under the name of liberty, in framing theories. In fact, although all affirmation depends, for its form as affirmation, on volition, yet, as to its content, there are some affirmations which we make because we will it, and others which we make because we cannot help it. The former consti- tute belief without knowledge, and are always accompanied by doubt; the latter constitute knowledge in which belief is swallowed up, and of which doubt is impossible. The question between knowledge and belief is, of course, a very old one. I cannot think that M. Renouvier has made it clearer. It is really one of the questions which depend on 'a prior, but often tacit, adoption of either an absolutist or a pheno- menist view of existence. All knowledge appears to be belief, if you tacitly suppose an existence which might appear differ- ently from what it 'does appear. You then ask a reason why this 1appearance is as it is, or why it appears at all. Then you say you have belief of it, irresistible it may be, but still belief. If on the other hand you take phenomena to be co-extensive with existence, then all constant phenomena are cases, not of belief, but of knowledge, for there is no further possibility of their contradictories being true. The value and significance of</page><page sequence="33">M. Renouvier's Philosophy.-PsycAology. 205 such constant phenomena may vary with the other facts, in relation to which they stand; but so far as they go, they are irreversible, and we have true knowledge of them, though in- complete. Again, then, we find M. Renouvier, led by his analysis, departing from his own doctrine of thorough-going phenomenism. The transition to the third branch of the subject, the founda- tion of liberty in the nature of things, may be shown best by a passage in which " liberty in itself" is treated: " I shall complete the definition of liberty, to justify belief in which is the object of this chapter, by characterising it as the ultimate essence and proper substance of the human person, or, continuing to use the scholastic terms, as the principle of individuation of that person ". (II. 359.) He regards it as a " primitive fact beyond which we canniot go" (TI. 364); refusing to consider the idea that it is produced in us by the creative will of a prior being who is himself free, as an explanation. This, he truly says, would be only assuming the same fact twice, putting " crea- tion of creation" in place of creation simply, and "liberty to create free beings" in place of liberty alone. (IT. 362-3.) Neither will he regard liberty, as explained by saying, that it is the necessary outcome of causation. Causation can never explain how a " power of escaping causation" can exist. " Causality, I have often repeated, does not explain the effect by the cause, unless the proper nature of the effect enters into the definition of the force " [producing it] " and consequently of the cause itself qua cause, which destroys the pretended explanation." (II. 365.) Very true. Freedom, in M. Renouvier's sense, cannot be explained by causation. But in that case what becomes of the category of causality, as an ultimate law, of which the will is, as we saw in the Logic, the chief instance ? Here is, apparently at least, an admission that it breaks down at the crucial point. In fact, at the beginning of this third branch of the subject, a complete change in the point of view takes place. Hitherto M. Renouvier has been demonstrating the fact of liberty in the will; now he is- seeking the ground of this fact. His solution is, that the ground of liberty in the will is liberty as the principle of individuation; " an aptitude of man to reflect, to deliberate, to will, to create by will, instead of yielding to the vertige of repre- sentation ";" a power to dominate (primer) his other functions"; a power " not self-caused but a datum"; and " establishing itself at the passage from the animal to the human nature" in him, (II. 360.) Liberty is thus the cardinal and general fact, of which will is a case. Accordingly, to render it in some sort intelligible, he has recourse to an earlier category, that of Becomr ing, Devenir. " The true doctrine of liberty," he says, " makes us consider the world as an order which becomes, and makes</page><page sequence="34">206 Mi. Benouvier's Philosophy.-Psychology. itself, (devient et se fait), not as a pie-established order which has only to u6nroll itself in time." (II., p. 364.) Human liberty has thus its, root, so to speak, in nature at large. But how, it may still be asked, does this explain that feature of liberty whereby it is the "fact of commencement," "commencement itself, the existing being itself, without other possible explanation," as M. Renouvier characterises it farther on ?. (II. 366.) The only answer is, that it does not explain it; this category also breaks down: "The mystery of liberty is the last and highest form of that mystery which we have touched in the fact of pure actual becoming, in that of first commencement, in that of an existent (de l'4tre). The mystery of pri- mordial data is the inevitable extremity of speculation and of things, for everything has had a beginning, the prior process in infinitum being con- tradictory." (II., p. 366.) The devenir is thus one form of the mystery, and liberty is another. But why a mystery at all ? I see only a mystification. A first or uncaused commencement is no miysterv, but a grattti- tous puzzle. It is imported by the theory, not found in the facts. It comes from taking categories, or laws of thought, as the ulti- mate laws of consciousness, and letting them override time as a form of perception. The form of time then asserts its real power over thought, and you have the contradictory notion of a first beginning, which, as first, presupposes time both before and after it, and yet as beginning has nothing before it at all. There are doubtless mysteries in the world, but this is not one of them. How real contingency is possible, how it can even be con- strued to thought, is also left unexplained. It is taken as part of the ultimate fact of liberty. We must believe it, whether we can understand it or not. Yet to believe what we can in no degree understand, is to believe an empty word. Elsewhere (Philos. of Beflection, II. 414-22) I have endeavoured to show that real contingency, that is, contingency involving opposites equally possible in fact as well as in our representation, is not thinkable; it is a word and not a thought, consequently not a reality. Yet before evidence in its favour is admitted from liberty, from morality, from certitude, the logical possibility of the thing itself ought certainly to be made clear. Without that, it is only a difficulty the more, in the way of accepting liberty itself. Against this "nest" of contradictions resulting from M. Renouvier's theory he would, I suppose, set off the one contra- diction which he imagines to be involved in the determinist theory, that of a realised infinite. But this, as I have shown in my former article, does not attach to any theory so far as based upon forms of perception, as determinism is, whatever it may do</page><page sequence="35">M. Renoitvier's Philosophy.-Psychology. 207 to scholastic hypotheses of " substances ". Liberty and Ilnfinity are notions which go naturally together, being alike based on perception; but once close the circuit, so to speak, bv introducing either the notion of substance or categories of thought as ulti- mate, and then liberty can be had' only at the cost of contyadic- tion. M. Renouvier has the choice: either liberty is true, and then the categories are insufficielit, or the categories are suffici- ent, and then liberty is a delusion. The conception of liberty as the essence of man carries us-over at once to the third Part of the Psychology, that which treats of The Probabilities concerning the moral order of the world," and has for its themes, Immortality, Liberty, and God. Here we enter upon ground the possession of which is the peculiar char- acteristic of M. Renouvier's sciences of Critique Ge4ne'rale, naniely, upon the unseen world of probabilities and belief which those sciences embrace at once and together with the seen world of positive science. Before closing the second Part of the Psycho- logy, an admiiirable classification of the sciences is sketched out, based on the old threefold division into Moral, Logical, and Physical, and (inter alita) reconstituting, the Moral group by re- ferring its sciences to the larger head of General Criticism (Critique G6n&amp;rale), thus giving them a distinctly philosophical basis. The results'are tabulated in the Summary (Formulatire) appended to the Psychology, which will be found an useful aid to students. Moral liberty is the efficient link between man in his mortal state, in the seen world, and man in his immortal state in the unseen world. " Immortality is the right to progress, liberty is the using it." (III. 180.) As to the third problem, the nature and existence of God, two aspects must be distinguished in immortality, one relating to the individual, the other to the con- stitution of the world which makes inidividual immortality possible, " a most general law which assures the means of realis- ing individual ends ". The object of this supreme conception is God. (III. 185-6.) Now the conception of immortality and that of God depend, apart from their realisation by liberty, upon a category or law of their own, namely, uyon the category, or law of final causation (Finaeditu). What is the validity of this conception, and. what application are we entitled to make of it-? Here M. Renouvier's analysis is excellent. Final causes, he says, have no place in the special sciences, which are or ought to be occupied with efficient causes only. They are essential, on the other hand, to the moral and political sciences. (III. 109.) This by no means implies that they are not traceable in the phenomena treated by</page><page sequence="36">208 M. Renouvier's Philosophy.-Psychology. the special sciences, but that, where they are so, they are im- ported by the modes of observation or reasoning which man brings with him. There are two ways in which final causes may be regarded; first, the relation of means and ends may be contemplated simply as fact; secondly, it may be contemplated in its origin, as in putting the question whether design implies a designer; and M. Renouvier keeps strictly to the first. (III. 112, 115.) " Every change implies a final cause (fin)." (III. 113). Still in the in- organic world this relation is shrouded in obscurity. It is in the organic world that it begins to be clearer, and more and more so' as we ascend the scale; so that there we can describe it by its general characteristics, as a mutual adaptation of properties to functions, or in M. Renouvier's words " the constant arrangemnent of facts for constant ends" (III. 113), and say that, with regard to the individual, "the law of final cause, recognised in the individual being, may be strictly enunciated as the existence of a destiny of that being; for a destiny is nothing but the end which we spolntaneously pursue in virtue of an order established in nature." (III. 124.) This brings him directly to state the question of immortality "Can we make a legitimate induction, from the known and partial destiny of certain individual beings, to a general and in- definitely prolonged one of the same beings ? " (III. 125). His aanswer is yes. If ends are to be realised at all, it is for individu- als that they must be so; since it is only for an individual that anl end has value or even meaning. " Shall we console Sisyphus by promising him annihilation and a series of successors for ever, to roll his stone still higher, the stone always to fall back, the successors always to be annihilated ?" (III. 131.) But are ends to be realised at all ? The affirmative is implied in the law of final cause itself. Some fulfilment it must have: "When we look at the ends which appear to be implied in those rela- tions which are known to us, we say that the laws of the universe tend to constitute individual beings and to preserve them; and we believe, by an induction then"ceforward legitimate, due to the rmioral forces of consciousness, that these beings are temporarily and for sense effaced at certain points of their career, because they are a part of vaster, but equally individual, functions, the course of which is withdrawn from our actual means of observation." (III. 130.) This of course is a mere outline of the argument, Its strength lies in showing what those " known relationas " are, which point to a fulfilment after death. What M. Renouvier has chiefly in view is the moral law, and its ideal harmony, which cannot be realised for inidividuals on earth. He builds also on the instinct of immortality, which he says points to a realisation of some sort</page><page sequence="37">M. Renouvier's Pltilosophy.-Psychology. 209 or other. (III., p. 170-2.) The real question is,-of what sort? Now the two tendencies spoken of in man point to the two char- acteristics of the realisation; the first is virtue, the second happi- ness, and the realisation of both must consist of the harmony between them. On the other side, two facts militate against the realisation of this harmony; one is physical evil, which is summed up in one word,-death; the other is moral evil, of the existence of which there is but one explanation, and that is the fact of liberty, and but one cure, the exercise of liberty. The moral law is a real eause acting efficiently in nature; it clianges the state both of individuals and of society. There is progress towards an ideal end, the harmony of virtue and happiness, effected by means of liberty, along with diminution both of physical and of moral evil. Death only remains wholly unaffec- ted. We ask then, Is deatlh annihilatioln of the personality ? Nothing ever has proved, or ever can prove it. Against it we have the whole force of the facts which constitute man's mnoral tenden- cies, powers, and ideas.--Such is briefly M. Renouvier's argument, the gist of which I have tried to gather frormi various 'passages (e.g., III., 154, 155, 171, 172, 181-4). But I must remind the reader that it cannot be properly appreciated from so brief a sketch. I pass over, too, his subtil and acute criticism of Kant's theory of the practical reasoh, in its bearihig on the three pro- blems which are to both of them the great problems of philoso- phy. Unwillingly, but -my limits are all but reached. In fact to treat properly a work so full of varied matter as M. Renou- vier's would require thrice the space at my disposal. I pass over, too, his critical sketch of the various hypotheses which may be entertained as to the conditions of existence of immortality, its " physical means " as he calls them; remarking only that it will well repay study; and this brings us to the last chapter of the work, " Rational Hypotheses as to the nature of God On this subject, and with reference to this chapter, I have already spoken in my former article, in connexion with the question of Infinity. I need not dwell upon it farther. Some few general remarks only I would make on the whole method. Rightly in my opinion does M. Renouvier take the practical reason as his clue to tlhe unseen world, a future life, .and God, as Kant also did; and rightly also does he reject, what Kant retained, the- non-phenomenal character of the unseen. But there is a distinction wanting in his system, owing to im- perfect analysis, which makes his whole theory .insecure. There is wanting the distinction between what we must necessarily think as belonging to the unseen world, and what therein is matter of probability only. Without this distinction, the whole content of the unseen world becomes merely probable, and at</page><page sequence="38">210 l., Renouvier's Philosophy.-Psychology. the same time its anthropomorphism becomes more full of detail. The categories are so coarse an instrument, that on the one hand they do not permit us to distinguish knowledge from belief in kind, but only in degree, certitude itself being set down as a belief; and on the other, they include so much, they let pass so many particulars in which the unseen world must resemble the seen, that it becomes a mere reflex of man's nature. Man psychological, so to speak, is carried over into the unseen world, and not merely man metaphysical; since functions corresponding to allZ the categories may be employed with equal right in en- deavouring to imagine it. It is on two and only two grounds, in my view, that we must affirm the existence of the Unseen, which are therefore also the only strictly necessary elements in our conception of it, (1) the .fact that infinity and free action are bound up as percepts inl all objects of thought, and (2) that the law of thought itself, its form not its content, involves attention, and therefore expecta- tion of a better. These and these only are the elements in the analysis of consciousness which necessitate the affirmation of an unseen world, and are the necessary features in it for conscious- ness. The rest, the filling up of the picture, as we may call it, are what M. Renouvier represents all knowledge to be, proba- bilities greater or less, objects of belief. In filling up this picture of the unseen world, the moral law with its content, the moral nature of man in the concrete, is, as M. Renouvier most truly holds, our only sure guide. But to apply this alone, to apply it as if it were the whole of our means, that is, without drawing the distinction of what is strictly necessary in it and what is not, is really to dwarf the unseen to the measure of the seen, to reduce God to be only in the likeness of men. It is carrying anthropomorphism too far, by making too unrestricted use of it. On the other hand, philosophy cannot affirm the existence of God, as a necessary' truth. It belongs to the filling up of the, picture, not to its necessary outline, to its content not to its form. When God's existence is affirmed to be necessary, the necessity is in the feeling not in the thought; and the thought follows and depends on the feeling. It is a belief founded upon love; that is to say, it is faith. The logical validity of this belief, or in other words, the rigAt to believe, if you have the love, is assured by philosophy, inasmuch as it shows that disproof of it is impossible. But the positive motive is for religion, not philosophy, to supply. All the objections, then, which I have found myself obliged to make to M. Renouvier's philosophy, resolve themselves into an</page><page sequence="39">if. Renouvier's Philosophy.-Psychology. 211 objection that his analysis is not pushed far enough, leaving untouched his general basis of phenomenism, except so far as it is imperilled by imperfect analysis. In the present article the main points of objection have been three: (1) the connexion between metaphysic, or logic as he calls it, and psychology, (2) the doctrine of liberty and contingency, (3) the construction of the unseen world. As to the first, he does not seem to have sufficiently distinguished between subjectivity in philosophy and subjectivity inpsychology; between consciousness or repre'sentation representative as equivalent to all its objects or representes, 7ra1V'TaTa 7rpa(y/laa, and consciousness in its history or mode of completing its system of r4epresentations representatives, in which it is specially dependent on one amiong all its represente's, namely, the. living orgainism in connexion with which it seems, in each instance, to arise. As to the second point, the profound collvic- tion of the fact of freedom has led him, in tlhe absence of a dis- tinction between percept and concept, to a theory of freedom in which it appears as the contradictory of necessity, and so succumbs to the reflection, that without necessity there is no thought. As to the third point, there the defect in analysis con- sists in not distinguishling precisely wlhat are the necessary ele- ments in all thought, as contrasted with those parts of the content which are niot necessarily corqbined with thenm. All these questions are, I think, fairly opeln to discussion. Far be it from me to dream of dogmatising upon them. And no one can be entitled to be heard with greater respect than M. Reiiou- vier himself, no one can speak with greater weight. In any case the fundamental, or as he would say enveloping, doctrine of Phenomenism is secure, and conistitutes the very atmosphere of thought, in which alone all further discussions can live and move. Without such a basis being laid, the bearing of all argu- ments, whether analytic or constructive, is liable to constant misconception; and such a basis M. iRenouvier has been the first to lay, in his system of philosophical phenomenismn. Philosophi- cal, not merely empirical; not phenomenism of the kind which turns away from, but of that which faces, the ultimate problems of thought. With Philosophical Phenomenism M. Renouvier's name and fame will be indissolubly associated. SHADWORTH H. HODGSON.</page></plain_text>
