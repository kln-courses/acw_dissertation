Trisha Spears and L. G. Abele. Florida State University, Tallahassee. Nucleotide sequences from the 18S subunit of ribosomal RNA were determined for representatives of four higher decapod infraorders: Palinura (Panulirus sp.), Thalassinidea (Callianassa sp.), Anomura (Clibanarius sp.), and Brachyura (9 species representing 9 families across 5 sections). Preliminary analysis of the data revealed 48 phylogenetically informative characters which were used to infer phylogenies under the principle of maximum parsimony, using Panulirus sp. as an outgroup. The shortest trees obtained revealed the following trends in branching patterns: the Dromiidae branch very early, prior to the Anomura; the Raninidae are isolated from the eubrachyura, which form a fairly cohesive group with the exception of the Majidae. MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY OF DECAPOD CRUSTACEANS BASED ON 18S rRNA NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCES. W. Kim and L. G. Abele. Florida State University, Tallahassee. Nucleotide sequences were determined for six decapod crustaceans: one from the suborder Dendrobranchiata (Penaeus aztecus) and five from the suborder Pleocyemata, representing four different infraorders (Procaris ascensionis and Palaemonetes kadiakensis, Caridea; Stenopus hispidus, Stenopodidea; Procambarus leonensis, Astacidea; and Callinectes sapidus, Brachyura). At least 1000 nucleotides per species were obtained, of which 109 were phylogenetically informative under the parsimony criteria. Parsimony and maximum likelihood methods were used to infer phylogenetic relationships; Artemia salina (Branchiopoda) was used as an outgroup. Both methods yielded somewhat similar results: P. aztecus is relatively isolated from the other decapod taxa; S. hispidus comes off the tree next, followed by a branch containing P. ascensionis and P. kadiakensis and another one containing P. leonensis and C. sapidus. These results differ from those based on morphological data in the placement of S. hispidus. RED SEA DECAPODS ALONG THE MEDITERRANEAN COAST OF ISRAEL: EVOLUTION OF A FAUNA. B. Galil. Tel Aviv Univ., Israel. Evolution of the Eastern Mediterranean fauna under Eritrean influence is presently taking place. More than 30 species of Indo-Pacific decapods entered the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal, became established and founded thriving populations along the Mediter? ranean coast of Israel. The penetration of Indo-Pacific elements and the correlative change in the native fauna form a characteristic feature of the Israeli coast and have significantly altered its zoogeo- graphical affinities. A first account is given of three new Immigrant decapods. The abundance, distribution and habitat preferences of lessepsian migrants belonging to three families (Penaeidae, Alpheidae and Portunidae) are discussed. FOSSIL CRABS FROM TKE TEPEE B.UTTES OF SOUTH DAKOTA. G. A. Bishop* and A. B. Williams. Georgia Southern College, Statesboro, and National Marine Fisheries Systematics Laboratory, Washington, D. C. Tepee Buttes are low conical hills occurring in scattered clusters along out- crops of Late Cretaceous Pierre Shale near Pueblo, Colorado, and around the Black Hills of South Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming, Such erosional landforms develop around resistant cylindrical limestone masses deposited by subraarine springs in relatively homogeneous, less resistant claystones. They provided a unique habitat in the Western Interior seaway for large populations of the lucinid bivalve, Nymphalucina occidentalis, preserved in reef-like masses encircling low relief spring vent mounds. The Nymphalucina association included ammonoid cephalopods, bivalved mollusks, gastropods, foraminifers, and rare decapod crustaceans. Crabs repre? senting two raninid and one prosoponid species collected near Oelrichs and Newell, S. D., occupied a niche soraewhat similar to that associated with hydro- thermal vents in Recent oceans.</page><page sequence="3">Abstracts 3A HOW HERMIT CRABS BIAS THE FOSSIL RECORD OF GASTROPODS. S.E. Walker and J.T. Carlton. Univ. of California, Berkeley, and Oregon Institute of Marine Biology, Charleston. Hermit crabs thrive on the California coast today although their representation in the Pleistocene belies this recent dis? tribution. This scarce record (based on chelipeds) has biased interpretations of their geologic history and de-emphasizes their role in biasing the gastropod fossil record. Our results show that Tegula funebralis shells when occupied by Pagurus samuelis, have a unique set of encrusting and boring organisms (bionts) associated with the shell aperture. These bionts oc? cur on 60%(n=985) of hermitted shells but none occur with the living snail (n=1074). Trace fossils characteristic of these bi? onts were evident on Pleistocene T_. fune? bralis from 15 localites (Baja to central California) although _P. samuelis body fos? sils were not present. Degree of paguriza- tion (number of shells with hermit crab- indicating bionts) varied within local? ities from 0-67%(average, 40%). Also, T\ funebralis representation in Pleistocene samples was low compared to other rocky shore gastropods. We hypothesize that the preference of _P. samuelis for T\ funebra? lis shells has, in part, contributed to this biased sample, as evidenced by the degree of pagurization on these fossils. MECHANISMS OF PREDATION ON MYTILUS EDULIS BY LARGE DECAPODS. K.E. Moody University of Maine, Darling Marine Center, Walpole. Four species of large decapod crustaceans (Carcinus maenas, Cancer irroratus, Cancer borealis, and Homarus americanus ) coexist and prey on the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis in the shallow subtidal zone of the Gulf of Maine. I studied foraging and feeding behaviors of these predators in the field and lab relative to mussel sizes and shell characteristics. My investigation involved questions of prey selection, critical prey size, shell opening tactics, and shell fragment patterns. To date it appears that smaller species (C. maenas and C. irroratus) prey more selectively and are capable of opening larger mussels relative to their body size than larger species. Through video analyses of foraging activities, I found that these smaller species also move faster, are more dextrous and demonstrate more active and variable shell opening tactics. Differences in shell breakage also correspond to this pattern and indicate that smaller species tend to concentrate their attack on weaker areas of the mussel shell while larger species apply their crushing power to places where the greatest normal forces are possible. LOCOMOTION IN DEEP-SEA AMPHIPODS: BODY DESIGN AND FUNCTIONAL MORPHOLOGY OF SWIM? MING APPENDAGES. M.A. Boudrias. Scripps Inst. Ocean., Univ. California, San Diego. Lysianassid amphipods are ubiquitous, efficient scavengers of deep-sea food falls. They are well adapted hydrodynami- cally to swim long distances and arrive at bait rapidly. Comparisons with other deep-sea species show that Eurythenes gryllus possess the optimal biomechanical design among scavenging amphipods. The body has a profile thickness of 0.25 which maximizes drag reduction based on both vo? lume and frontal area. The body also has a dorsal keel to enhance the water flow around it, spatulate third uropods with long setae used as rudders, and the most complex mechanical arrangement of pleopo- dal skeletomusculature. The dicondylic joint between the coxa and the basis in pleopods functions as a ball and socket joint permitting maximum extension on the power and recovery strokes. The basal segment of the pleopodal peduncle has in- terlocking spines and a chitinous cusp that holds both rami together on the po? wer stroke maximizing drag and propulsion. The pleopods are controlled by a complex of 14 muscle bundles which are both long and wide providing great contraction speed and strength. UNDERSTANDING THE AMPHIPOD MANDIBLE: ITS FUNCTIONAL MORPHOLOGY AND PHYLOGENETIC IMPORTANCE. L^ Watling. Darling Marine Center, Univ. Maine, Walpole. The amphipod mandible has been used to sort amphipods according to genera for many years, but its use as a phylogenetic tool has just begun. Much of what has been written by taxonomists about the mandible, especially the molar, is not exactly correct. The molar is a crushing apparatus whose function may sometimes be usurped by a broadened incisor. The incisor is the most versatile part of the mandible, being used for crushing or cutting. There is no evidence that elongate, pointed incisors can be used for piercing. The structure of the mandible and its associated musculature exerts a strong influence on the structure of the other mouth field appendages and the anterior part of the pereon, These influences need to be considered when constructing phylogenetic scenarios.</page><page sequence="4">4A American Society of Zoologists MOUTHPART AND FOREGUT ONTOGENY IN LARVAL, POSTLARVAL, AND JUVENILE SPINY LOBSTER Panulirus argus Latreille (DECAPODA, PALINURIDAE). S.H. WolfeandB.E. Felgenhauer. Florida State University, Tallahassee. The mouthparts and the external and internal mor? phology of the foregut of the 11 phyllosoma (larval) stages, thepuerulus (postlarva), and the 1st juvenile of P. argus were examined and described using SEM. The larval foregut is not arranged in the typical deca- podan form, but has a single chamber (no separate car? diac and pyloric chambers), and lacks a gastric mill and, in the first two stages, a gland filter. The foregut of the puerulus more closely resembles the typical decapod structure and is similar to that of the adult. However, key structures are incompletely formed and the foregut may, in this stage, be nonfunctional. The foregut of the 1st juvenile is fully developed and closely resembles that of the adult. Phyllosoma mouthparts differ substantially from those of the puerulus and juvenile. The 2nd maxillae and maxilli- peds are located away from the esophageal entrance. The asymetrical mandibles bear numerous teeth and spines and have molar processes forming an intricate toothed shear. Mouthparts of the puerulus resemble those of juveniles and adults but appear incompletely formed. Structural differences associated with habitat were evident. Characters were found which may per- mit species identification of palinurid larvae. 10 LIMB REGENERATION IN THE FRESHWATER PRAWN, MACROBRACHIUM ROSENBERGII. K. Lafferty. Intro. by Jeff Shields Univ. of California, Santa Barbara. Macrobrachium rosenbergii collected from Australia's Northern Territory were heterochelous (unequal claws). Pond cultured Thai M_^_ rosenbergii are isochelous. I hypothesized that a high rate of autotomy in nature, due to predation, might produce the observed heterochely; i.e., following autotomy, a regenerating chela lags behind its intact counterpart, leading to chelae of permanently different sizes. Prawns (Thai stock), held individually, had one, two, or no (control) claws removed. The regenerating limb attained the length of the intact limb in 3-4 molts. When two chelae were removed, they regenerated equally. Thus, claw loss does not impose permanent heterochely. In addition, regeneration did not affect the growth of the intact claw. Growth of the prawn, however, was affected. Regenerating prawns had larger molt increments than controls, but molt interval was not significantly different. 11 RESPONSE OF MEIOFAUNAL COPEPODS TO CHANGING SEAGRASS LANDSCAPES. S.S. Bell. Univ. of South Florida/Tampa. Faunal communities, including meiofaunal copepods, inside seagrass beds diverge from those in nearby unvegetated areas. Replicate sites (10 x 20 m) devoid of vegetation and adjacent to natural seagrass beds were planted with Halodule to a density approximating 10% of natural levels. Meiofaunal copepods from sediments and/or seagrass blades were sampled at the start of the study and over a 1 year period in natural Halodule (NH), experimentally planted (PH) and bare sediment (BS) areas. After 1 year the vegetation in PH vas vell established but did not approach densities of NH. Copepod species composition and abundance in PH vas more similar to BS than NH sites after 1 year. The above findings suggest that meiofaunal invasion of nevly created landscapes may not be rapid and may be intimately linked to seagrass cover and its concomitant effects. 12 SIZE scaling and habitat selection FOR THE PHYTAL AMPHIPOD GAMMARELLUS ANGULOSUS. S. D. Hacker. Univ. of Maine, Darling Marine Lab, Walpole. Laboratory and field experiments using real algae and plastic mimics of different morphologies indicate that habitat selection and size-frequency distributions of the intertidal amphipod, Gammarellus angulosus, are primarily dependent on the size and abundance of spaces created by algal fronds. Food value does not appear to be as important because similar patterns were found for both real and plastic algae. Algal morphologies were classlfied as filamentous, coarsely branched, foliose, and kelp-like, and the abundance and size of habitable space was estimated for each. Amphipod densities were found to be positively correlated with habitat complexity and their mean size was correlated with the size of spaces within the algae. Other important habitat attributes included the tenacity and color of the algae. For a given morphology, it was found that amphipods prefer algae with lower tenacity possibly due to better adhesion of the amphipod to the substrate. Amphipods also preferred darker colors of algae, irrespective of morphology, possibly due to the crypsis it affords them.</page><page sequence="5">Abstracts 5A 13 STABILIZED COAL ASH AS A SETTLEMENT SUBSTRATUM: ACCEPTABILITY TO OYSTER LARVAE AND POTENTIAL FOR UPTAKE OF CONTAMINANT METALS. K.M. MUELLER and K.S. PRICE (intro. by P.M. Gaffney). Coll. of Marine Studies, Univ. of Delaware, Lewes. Coal ash, stabilized vith cenent, has been proposed as an alternative cultch material for finfish and shellfish reefs. However, coal ash contains potentially harmful trace and toxic metals. This study was designed to determine the acceptability of the stabilized ash as a settlement surface for oyster (Crasgogtrea ylrgllllca) larvae, and to assess the potential for uptake of contaminant metals from ash by attached oysters. Five experimental substrata were used: oyster shell control, concrete control, and three different ash mixtures. Of approximately 4700 spat, 32.1% and 30.4% settled on oyster shell control and the ash mixture containing bottom ash, respectively. The remaining ash mixtures (primarily fly ash, with less surface texture) had 16.7% and 13.3% of total spat set, while the concrete control had 7.5% of the total spat set. Potential for metals uptake was determined using two substrata: oyster shell and stabilized ash containing bottom ash. Of eight metals analyzed to date, Fe, Mn, and Zn were present in significantly higher quantities in ash- grown oyster tissue. There was no significant difference for Cd and Cu tissue concentrations and concentrations of Cr, Ni, and Pb were below detection limits. Stabilized coal ash appears to be an acceptable settlement substratum for oyster larvae. 14 RECRUITMENT AND BODY SIZE-DEPENDENT HABITAT SELECTION AND PREDATOR IMPACT IN EARLY BENTHIC PHASE AMERICAN LOBSTERS. R. A. Wahle. Univ. of Maine, Orono. Early benthic phase (EBP) American lobsters, Homarus americanus from settlement at 5 mm carapace length (CL) to approximately 35 mm CL, predominate in the interstitial spaces of cobbles and boulders in coastal Maine. In contrast, larger lobsters, while still preferring shelters, are frequently found outside of them on featureless bottoms. Predation experiments and substratum preference experiments examined the significance of this pattern. In situ predation experiments show that tethered EBP lobsters are attacked (by demersal fishes and crabs) significantly sooner on featureless soft bottom than on cobble, and that vulnerability to predators declines dramatically with small increments in body size. These results help explain the strong tendency of shelter-seeking behavior in this group, as well as a strong preference for cobble over mud, sand, or gravel. Analysis of this sheltering behavior allows predictions to be made of the preferred substratum size for a given size lobster. Since cobble-boulder substratum comprises only 3-16% of the bottom in this region of Maine it is a potentially limiting resource to recruiting lobsters. 15 A DYNAMIC OPTIMIZATION MODEL OF JUVENILE LOBSTER SUBSTRATE SELECTION. D.R. BRYANT-RICH*, D.E. BARSHAW. Rutgers University Marine Field Station, Tuckerton, NJ 08087 During the fourth stage of larval development juvenile American lobsters (Homarus americanus) leave the plankton and become benthic. Once a juvenile lobster has created a burrow it remains burrow bound until it reaches a size between 20 to 40 mm carapace length. Before initial burrowing lobsters have been observed to repeatedly sample different substrates which may be accepted or rejected. Upon rejection the lobster returns to the plankton for a short time before again sampling the substrate. This sampling procedure must be completed before the lobster molts into the fifth stage since a lobster which molts outside of a burrow will be exposed to extreme predation pressures. We present a model of the substrate selection behavior of juvenile lobsters developed using dynamic optimization techniques. The model examines the role of substrate quality, lobster mortality and time, upon the decision to accept or reject the substrates sampled. Solutions are presented for discrete and continuous time forms of the model and for several substrate frequency distributions. 16 HABITAT SELECTION BY JUVENILE BLUE CRABS IN A HALODULE WRIGHTII COMMUNITY. A.H. Williams, L.D. Coen, and M.S. Stoelting*. Auburn Univ., Auburn, AL. Seagrass communities, such as Halodule wrightii, often exhibit higher densities of benthic macrofaunal species than sur? rounding unvegetated habitats. Also, species densities often vary along a vegetational density gradient. This study examined habitat selection preferences of juvenile Callinectes sapidus (&lt;40 mm cara? pace width) from field sampling and laboratory choice studies. In the field, newly recruited blue crabs (&lt;5 mm) did not show a preference for grasses of varying density. However, individuals of both 5-10 mm and 10-15 mm widths exhibited signifi? cant differences in densities which varied through time along a vegetational gradient. Larger individuals were exclu- sively found in unvegetated habitat. When individuals were given a choice between sand and high density grass in the labora? tory, preference for grass was exhibited by 2.6 x as many individuals as those which chose sand. The latter were signifi? cantly larger than crabs selecting grass. For individuals identified by sex, males exhibited a 2:1 preference for grass, while females were indiscriminate. Future studies will examine these preferences when subjected to potential predators.</page><page sequence="6">6A American Society of Zoologists 17 OXYGEN GRADIENTS, GENETIC VARIATION IN METABOLIC RATE AND HABITAT CHOICE IN THE FISH XIPHOPHORUS VARIATUS. R. Borowsky. New York Univ., NY. Spring fed pools in Mexico inhabited by X_. variatus have oxygen gradients, from low DO to high, heading downstream. Since past work showed that adult males of the + tailspot morph had higher metabolic rates than those of the Ct morph (Borowsky, 1984, Evol. Genet. Fishes, Plenum), the dis? tribution of the morphs in pools was examined. As expected, Ct males were found to be relatively more common at the upper ends of pools and + males at the lower ends (X2=4.7, df=l, P&lt;.05). An unexpected observation was that the distribution of morphs differed between sexes (X2=8.1, df=2, P&lt;.05). In females, either there is no distributional bias or it is in the opposite direction, with Ct less common upstream. Habitat selection by genotypes in a variable environment can maintain genetic polymorphism (Taylor, 1975, Genetics 80:621). 18 DISTRIBUTION OF PELAGIC JUVENILE ROCK- FISHES IN RELATION TO UPWELLING PLUMES OFF CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. R.J. Larson, W.H. Lenarz and T. Wyllie Echeverria . San Francisco State Univ., CA and National Marine Fisheries Service, Tiburon, CA. Young-of-the-year rockfishes (Sebastes) have been sampled by midwater trawl at the conclusion of their pelagic stage every spring since 1983, primarily to assess year-class strength in some exploited species. Two persistent centers of coas? tal upwelling occur in our central Cali? fornia study area, and seem to affect the distribution of juveniles. Pelagic juven- iles were often rare to absent near the base of each upwelling plume. This is consistent with the hypothesis that pela? gic juveniles are not abundant in the deep source of upwelled water. However, the ultimate fate of individuals advected offshore in surface waters during upwel? ling is unclear. Such individuals could be lost to the population, or they may be able to await the actions of eddies or the relaxation of upwelling to carry them back to the vicinity of benthic nurseries. Occasionally, large pelagic juveniles have been abundant at the very base of an up? welling plume, suggesting the possibility of behavioral adaptations to transport conditions or even active swimming as means of moving to post-pelagic habitats. 19 HABITAT USE AND COMMUNITY STBUCIURE IN OOTTID FISHES. S.F. Norton. Univ. of Chicago, Chicago, IL. The spatial distributions of six species of subtidal cottid fishes in the San Juan Islands of Washington were censused to determine the influence of substrate type (e.g, rock, sand, mud) and interspecific competition on conmunity structure. Among a patchwork of substrates, occurrences of individuals were not random; each species showed significant microhabitat preferences. Examining distribution on a broader scale, a two-part stepwise multiple regression analysis first addressed the role of substrate abundance on species density. Variation in substrate abundance explained 40 to 60% of the variation in cottid densities. In the second part, the resulting residuals were used to examine interspecific effects on cottid density. Only six interspecific regression coefficients were significant and only one of these was negative. This seems to indicate that interspecific competition as measured as inverse density relationships is not strong among subtidal cottids. Ihis hypothesis is in contrast with the results of previous studies that have concluded that intertidal fish communities dominated by cottid fishes are structured by competition. 20 MICROHABITAT SELECTION IN A FOSSORIAL LIZARD. Lawrence E. Hunt, Dept. of Biological Sciences, Univ. California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 Because the geographic distribution of a species is a dynamic composite of eco? logical and historical factors, these factors operate to produce the same re? sult but at widely varying spatial and temporal scales. There is a functional relationship between ecological and biogeographical distribution, but in order to examine regional distribution, one must know how a species responds to its environment on a local scale. The California legless lizard, Anniella pul- chra Gray ranges widely throughout central and southern California. Study sites in central California show these lizards to be surprisingly catholic in their choice of macrohabitats but quite selective in terms of available microsite conditions. Microclimatic and microedaphic factors including soil temperature, moisture, and density appear to be important determin- ants of local distribution.</page><page sequence="7">Abstracts 7A 21 CONTRIBUTIONS OF CLONING TO THE GENETIC AND SPATIAL ORGANIZATION OF SEA ANEMONE POPULATIONS. R.J. Hoffmann* and W.E. Zamer. Iowa State University, Ames. Metridium semle is well known for its ability to reproduce asexually, forming large clones. Clone structure was examined in New England populations, using polymor? phic enzymes as markers to assess clonal affinity. Samples designed to minimize contributions of cloning show that there are marked differences among populations in the impact of asexual reproduction, with greatest importance of cloning found in the vicinity of Cape Cod. Some samples are composed of many clone mates, even though sampling covers wide areas. On the other hand, although it is conventional wisdom that local aggregations of M. semle are products of cloning, examina? tion of samples collected along transects through aggregations show that this is not always the case. Sometimes clusters are clonal, as expected, but they often are not. There is no obvious geographic pat? tern to the differences in clonal composi? tion of clusters of Metridium. The idea that local population density builds up through cloning is too simple. Instead it is the product of a complex interaction between cloning and recruitment of sexual- ly produced larvae. 22 POPULATION GENETICS OF AN AUTOTOMOUS SEASTAR. F.A.McAlarv. Cypress College, CA, and the Tatman Foundation, Santa Catalina, CA. To understand how asexual reproduction by ray autotomy effects the genetic structure of Linckia columbiae populations at Santa Catalina Island, genotypes for individual seatars were determined at eight polymorphic loci using gel electrophoresis. Results show that replicate genotypes occur in patches as small as 10 m^, as well as at locations around the island. Single and multiple ray autotomies and the migration of adults contribute to local concentration and mixing of clonal modules. A relatively high proportion of unique genotypes in the population suggests that recruitment of sexually produced individuals contributes significantly to genetic structure. Asexual reproduction functions largely to maintain population density and provide a basis for individuals (genotypes) to exploit favorable habitats. The absence of juvenile L. columbiae in two years of sampling, suggests that larval recruitment is rare. 23 GENETICS AND SYSTEMATICS OF THE SIX-RAYED SEA STAR LEPTASTERIAS HEXACTIS. K." E. Kwast. D. W. Foltz* ancTw". B, Stickle. Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge. The systematics of small six-rayed sea stars in the northern Pacific, genus Leptasterias, has been the subject of controversy for many years. Two species in this genus (L. hexactis Verrill, 1914 and L- aequaiis Verrill, 1914) and the subspecies L. hexactis forraa regularis (Fisher, 1930), formerly Verrill's (1914) L. epichlora. were synonymlzed by Chia (1966) on the basis of their ability to interbreed in the labora? tory, the name L. hexactis taking preced- ence. Using morphological observations coupled witn starch gel electrophoresis, we re-examined the systematics of this species complex. Nine population samples (&gt;100 animals/sample) of Leptasterias. from Juneau, AK and San Juan Island, WA, were examined for morphology and variation at 18 enzyme loci. Alaskan samples contained two forms of L. hexactis. fomiae regularis and hexactis."which were identified first by morphology, and then on the basis of distinct electromorphs at 4 loci. All 3 forms of the L- hexactis complex co-occur in Eopulations from San Juan Island, WA, and ased on electrophoretic analysis may rep? resent separate species currently categorized under the name L. hexactis. It is likely that ?,. hexactis forma regularis and L. hexactis forma hexactis do not hybrldize and may represent cryptic species which can be deflnitively identified oy allozymic analysis. In addition, to evaluate the genetic consequences of dispersal ability, we compared geographical differences in allele frequencies In these brooding species with other sea stars that have planktonic larval forms.

Palumbi.* Univ. of Hawaii, Honolulu, Hawaii. Shallow-water sea urchins of the genus Echfnometra, are broadly distributed across the tropical Indo-Pacific, and provide a system for the study of speciation in broadcast-spawning marine organisms with high-dis- persal larvae. Four distinct species, which are re- markably similar in morpholog/ and ecology, appear in different combinations at different sites within the re? gion. Relatedness of these species has been assessed by comparisons of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) restriction fragment patterns and cross-fertilizability of gametes. Low interspecific mtDNA divergence indicates that ge? netic lineages of the four Echinometra species became distinct recently, probably not until the Pleistocene. Intraspecific mtDNA variation was found to be highest in what are likely to be ancestral populations on Guam and Okinawa, while outlying, derived populations of the same species on Hawaii or Tahiti exhibited a marked reduetion of mtDNA variation. Intraspecific fertilization is always high, whether or not gametes are obtained from the same geographic region. In some cases, different species from different regions will also cross-fertilize effectively Different species from the same region, however, exhibit a distinct gamete incompatibility, and cross-fertilize only weakly. Barriers to interspecific gene flow at the level of fertilization may isolate recently founded, sym- patric populations of closely related species, and this type of reproductive isolation may be lost between dis? persed populations.

Palumbi.* University of Hawaii, Honolulu. The phylogenetic relationship and fre? quency of speciation in Strongylo- centrotus sea urchins was examined by comparing restriction site data for the mitochondrial genome. Sequence diver- gences for the species are 5.1?1.3% for S. droebachiensis-S. pallidus, 6.0?1.4% for S. droebachiensis-S. purpuratus, and 7.1?1.6% for S. purpuratus-S. pallidus. Maximum likelihood methods used to an? alyze the phylogenetic relationships suggest that S. droebachiensis, S. pal? lidus, and S. purpuratus have diverged from each other about the same time. In sea urchin species with wide distributions and extensive gene flow, speciation is expected to be infrequent. The results suggest, however, that these sea urchins went through a period during which speciation was relatively frequent.

Some 63 sites, representing 10 areas (5 mainland, 5 island), were each sampled using 8-16 cores. Channel Isles (CI, n-6) pair with w France &lt;wF, n*6&gt; &amp; s England &lt;sE, n-8), Isle of Man (IOM, n-3 &gt; with sw Scotland (swS, n?7), Isles of Scilly US, n*13) with sw England (swE, n-8), &amp; Crete &lt;CR, n-5) with s Greece (sG, n*2); Azores &lt;AZ, n?5&gt; are unpaired. Some 19-21 spp. of Macrodasyida occurred in all but swE (14), CR (5), s6 (5) &amp; AZ (4); 16-19 spp. of Chaetonotida occurred in all but sE (13), swE (11), IS (10), CR (12), sG (13) &amp; AZ (8); 25-39 total spp. occurred in all but CR (17), sG (18) &amp; AZ (12). Marine gastrotricha show relatively high levels of regional and even amphi- Atlantic cosmopolitanism. No. of spp. in islands do not differ greatly from adja? cent mainland areas. No. of macrodasyid spp. decreased noticeably in relatively atidal areas and/or in areas unprotected from dominant winter gales; no. of chaet- onotid spp. showed similar changes, but with less obvious effects. The result was that chaetonotid spp. outnumber mac- rodasyids in CR (12:5), sG (13:5) &amp; AZ (8:4), all areas of low tidal amplitude, the latter also subject to lntense gales. 27 NEW OBSERVATIONS ON THE BIOLOGY AND PHYLOGENY OF POGONOPHORA. E.C. Southward and A.J. Southward (intro. by R.I. Smith), Marine Biological Association, Plymouth, England. Light and electron microscopy studies of newly-settled stages of the vestimentiferan tube worm Ridgeia from hydrothermal vents of the Juan de Fuca ridge indicate dispersal is by a planktonic trochophore larva with a functioning gut. The segmentation of the early stages is similar to that of postlarvae of perviate pogonophorans with lecithotrophic development. The vestimentiferans and pogonophorans are closely related and can be regarded as sub-classes of the Pogonophora. The adults of both depend for nutrition on symbiotic bacteria, mostly sulphur oxidising chemoautotrophs. The bacteria occupy a special tissue derived from the larval gut. The vestimentiferans are opportunists evolved to suit high levels of dissolved sulphide at vents and cold seeps. The perviate pogonophorans such as Siboglinum exploit the lower levels of particulate reduced sulphur species in slope, shelf and fjord sediments. The exact relationship between Pogonophora and Annelida remains to be determined from further studies of early larvae. 28 THE "FABRICIIN" FAN WORMS (SABELLI- DAE: POLYCHAETA): A CASE OF UNREC- OGNIZED DIVERSITY AND EVOLUTION. Kirk Fitzhugh. American Museum of Natural History, New York. A proposed revision of the sabel- lid subfamily Fabriciinae will re- strict the group to 8 genera (4 un- described). As illustrated by this subfamily, sabellids are far more diverse morphologically than has been implied in the past. Fabri- ciin diversity is reflected mainly in the nature of branchial crown, peristomial and setal characters. An example of this is shown by the sister taxa, Augeneriella and "Genus B." All species of Augen? eriella have branched, vascular- ized, branchial crown "filaments," while most species of Genus B (and several other genera) have un- branched filaments. Filament onto? geny initially suggests that the unbranched state is plesiomorphic. However, phylogenetic analyses hypothesize independent derivations of filaments in the two genera. Genus B also displays a series of unique transformations in which the mouth and branchial crown have progressively shifted to a more dorsal position.</page><page sequence="9">Abstracts 9A 29 NECTOHELMItiSx A NEU GEMUS OF AEOLOSOMATID OLIGOCHAETE UORM. Steven L). Kincaid* and Johri A Ruffplo, Dept. of Biology, Univ. of tdisconsin-Uhiteuater. A new genus of freeliving, freshuater oligochaete uorm in the Family Aeolosomatidae is described. The type species is Nectohelmms dasysoma Chairy-bodied suimming uorm*); and it is characterized by the presence of cilia over its entire body surface, uhich ac? counts for the distinctive suimming be? havior. It is small, ranging in length from 140-1300 u.m, and about 65 u.m uide. ln culture it reproduces asexually by bud- ding. It appears to lack a true cuticle, has no setae, lacks external segmenta- tion, and its epidermal glands are unpig- mented. It has a straight digestive tract conslsting of a buccal cavity, pharynx, esophagus, and intestine. It feeds by rapidly dilating its pharynx, and sucking in particulate material or micro- organisms. The prostomium is slightly ta- pered anteriorly, and the paired cere? bral ganglia are completely separate. The histology of N. dasysoma is currently under investigation. A second species in this genus has been isolated and cloned. 30 IDENTIFICATION OF SOME PROBLEMATIC SPECIES OF CUCUMARIA (ECHINODERMATA: HOLOTHUROIDEA) FROM THE WEST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA. P. Lambert. Royal British Columbia Museum, Victoria, Canada. Two dendrochirote holothurians, Cucumaria piperata (Stimpson, 1864) and Cucumaria fisheri Wells, 1924, are white or yellow with dark spots on various parts of the body. In the literature, these forms have been variously identified as C. piperata, C. fisheri, C. lubrica and Eupentacta quinquesemita. The purpose of this paper is to resolve this apparent taxonomic confusion by analysing the original descriptions, museum specimens and field observations. C. piperata averages 8 cm in length, has tube feet in 5 rows, brownish-black spots on various parts of its body, and is primarily shallow subtidal in unexposed locations. C. fisheri averages 3 cm in length, has tube feet in rows and between, fine black spots around tentacles and on the dorsum, and is normally found on the exposed coast in crevices and in kelp holdfasts. Calcareous ossicles of the two species are illustrated. 31 A PRELIMINARY L00K AT THE SYSTEMATICS OF THE PYCNOGONIDA. B.A. Bain. City Univ. of New York, NY. The systematics of the class Pycnogonida are far from satisfactory at present. Each author has worked out a system that suits their particular needs. A comparison of these different schemes reveals some similarities and too many differences. One of the recurring problems within this group has traditionally been a lack of phylogenetically informative characters. The present research, using cladistic analysis, begins with a revision of the genus Austropallene (Family Callipallenidae). Using SEM and light microscopy, a number of characters are identified and a cladogram constructed. Characters to be used include the following: # and shape of teeth on chelicerae; # and arrangement of spines on propodus; #, shape, and arrangement of spines on ovigers; cement gland structure (male); genital operculum structure; structure and arrangement of spines around mouth. 32 PHYLOGENY OF ECHINODERMSi COMPARISON OF TREES BASED ON RADIOIMMUNOASSAY AND 18S RIBOSOMAL RNA SEQUENCE DATA.

Radioimmunoassay was used to calculate immunological distances between representatives of five classes of echinoderms. The results were compared with cladistic analyses based on 18S ribosomal sequence data and with traditional morphological and embryological evidence.

D. R. Brooks. University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada. A previously published phylogenetic systematic analysis of the major groups of parasitic platyhelminths was based on 39 anatomical characters. The resulting phylogenetic tree had a consistency index of 95% due to two postulated cases of convergence. That tree is evaluated in light of 49 additional anatomical characters and 32 ultrastructural characters. The additional anatomical characters support the original hypothesis with a consistency index of 100%, indicating no additional convergence in the data. The total anatomical database has a consistency index of 97.8%. The ultrastructural characters provide a best fit to a phylogenetic tree of 94.1% due to two postulated cases of convergent evolution. That tree is the same as the one supported by the anatomical data. The combined database thus comprises 120 characters having a consistency index of 96.7%, due to four postulated cases of convergent evolution. A classification of the major groups of parasitic platyhelminths is proposed, and represents a compromise between two earlier-proposed schemes.

Spiders of the genus Lutica from 19 populations in southern California and Baja California, including all the California Channel Islands except Anacapa, were compared electrophoretical- ly on the basis of variability at 15 gene loci. The phylogenetic tree produced by distance Wagner analysis of Rogers (1972) genetic distance values defines three groups which are largely concordant with the species groups indicated by morphology. The phylogeny and distribu? tion of alleles among populations reflects the geologic history of southern California and Baja California, which involves extensive sea level changes and the movements of allochthonous crustal fragments (tectono- stratigraphic or "suspect" terranes), and suggests that the evolutionary history of the genus Lutica has involved vicariance and dispersal, and perhaps local extinction. 36 A DEVELOPMENTAL MORPHOMETRIC APPROACH TO THE LAVIGERIA GASTROPOD SPECIES RADIATION IN LAKE TANGANYIKA. A.E.Michel (intro. by R.E. Strauss). University of Arizona, Tucson. The endemic gastropod Lavigeria has undergone a remarkable endemic radiation in Lake Tanganyika, Africa. Examination of museum and field collections revealed at least twelve distinct shell- based morphospecies in the genus. These were previously classified as two hypervariable species, but discrete morphs are frequently sympatrically distributed, suggesting a group in the process of speciating. Morphological similarities between reproductively isolated populations may be parallelisms in diverging clades or convergences due to developmental constraints on form. To distinguish convergences late in ontogeny, a multivariate morphometric approach documented differences in shell growth trajectories. Schindel's (1987) modifications of Raupian shell coiling parameters were used to record shape differences. The aperture is modeled as an independent generating curve rotating around the central axis, with growth between homologous points on the perimeter independent of movement of the generating curve. Sculpture and shape measurements were analyzed with principle components and discriminant functions analyses. Disjunct populations with similar morphologies are clearly separable despite overall similarity. Electrophoretic results concur, suggesting multiple convergences complicate a pattern of divergence from common ancestry.</page><page sequence="11">Abstracts IIA 37 A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF INTRA-SHELL THICKNESS VARIATION IN GASTROPODS. P. Kemp and R. Hellincr. Univ. of Washington, Seattle. Using museum specimens measurements of shell thickness and distance from the axis of coiling were made at three different points along the apertual lip. At least 10 individuals from each species, representing a wide range of families, were measured. Results showed that between individuals within a species thickness and distance from the axis of coiling is positively correlated, indicating that larger shells are thicker. However, within individual shells thickness and distance are negatively correlated, indicating that those points which are moving faster around the axis of coiling are thinner. These results along with others which show that faster growing individuals have thinner shells than slower growing ones support the hypothesis that shell deposition may limit the growth of gastropod shells. 38 CONGRUENT DATA SETS AND THE PHYLOGENY OF THE MOLLUSCA. D.R. Lindberg. Univ. of California at Berkeley. In most molluscan phylogenies, taxa are order- ed after the "most conservative character" has been identified and its distribution among taxa examined. These characters (including gills, radulae, muscle sears, nervous systems, larval morphology, shell coiling direction, and hinge teeth) are often compared and contrasted with the homologous nature of these characters assumed. Examples from the classes Polyplacophora, Monoplacophora, Bivalvia, and Gastropoda show that similar position and shape does not equal homology. One level of character homology can be understood by following the development of structure(s) through ontogeny. Because mollusks have mosaic development, homology can be followed through cell lineages, and cladograms based on characters derived from different lineages can be analyzed separately. For example, in gastropods and aplacophorans the characters and structures derived from the 4d cell lineage suggest the presence of strong heterochronic processes. In the aplacophorans it becomes especially difficult to distinguish what is primitive from what is simply paedomorphic. While in some gastropod clades, the use of these "developmentally defined" subsets of characters makes heterochronic trends readily apparent. 39 PHYLOGENY OF THE GASTROPTERIDAE (GASTROPODA: OPISTHOBRANCHIA). L_ M^ Gosliner. California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco. The Gastropteridae is a highly derived family of Cephalaspidea, possessing several autapomorphic features. Until recently, it was believed to represent a small, morphologically uniform taxon, but is now known to constitute a far more diverse family of 27 nominal species. Morphological polarity was determined primarily by outgroup comparison with the Philinidae and Aglajidae, supplemented by ontogenetic and functional criteria. The preferred phylogeny is one branch length longer than the most parsimonious configuration, but does not require reversal of complex characters. This cladogram supports the three described genera, Gastropteron, Sagaminopteron and Enotepteron, but requires an additional genus based on uniquely derived radular and reproductive features. Three of the four genera are known only from the Indo-Pacific tropics. 40 ONTOGENETIC MORPHOLOGY AND ALLOMETRY OF THE MIDDLE EAR IN MACROPUS EUGENII AND MONODELPHIS DOMESTICA (MARSUPIALIA). Chris Clark. Duke University, Durham, NC. The marsupial temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ) develops post-natally. It has been hypothesized that the primary jaw joint prior to TMJ formation is a combination of the malleo- incudal joint and incudo-parotic contact, i.e. a reptilian jaw joint In this study the growth of the middle ear skeletal structures in two marsupials is described in order to assess the relation between the possible functional demands and their patterns of growth and differentiation. Preliminary data indicate that in Macropus the malleus and incus grow isometrically (m=0.93 and 1.0 respecuvely;r&gt;0.97) with the head up to 24 days post-natally. In Monodelphis linear measurements of malleus and incus growth are isometric with head length (m=1.05 and 0.96 respectively; r&gt;0.8) up to 8 days post-natally, but volume measurements of these structures indicate a decreasing growth rate beginning around post-natal day 12. In Monodelphis. the changing growth rate closely follows the differentiation of the condylar cartilage (day 10) and is also associated with the onset of ossification in the malleus (day 11). In Macropus there is not a decrease in growth rate associated with the differentiation of the condylar cartilage. Further measurements of the malleus and incus in Macropus are neccessary to determine the relationship between the ossification (days 27 and 33 respectively) and the decrease in growth rates of these elements. I hypothesize that the decrease in growth rate of the middle ear bones is tied to the onset of ossification and not to their change in function from possible jaw joint to sound transducers.</page><page sequence="12">12A American Society of Zoologists 41 DEVELOPMENTAL BASIS OF EVOLUTIONARY SUCCESS: CRANIAL ONTOGENY IN A DIRECT-DEVELOPING ANURAN. J. Hanken and CH. Summers. Univ. of Colorado, Boulder. We examined embryonic and fetal skulls of the tropical anuran, Eleutherodactylus coqui, to evaluate how the biphasic pattern of cranial ontogeny in metamorphosing frogs has been modified in the evolution of direct development in this highly speciose vertebrate genus. Bone formation is distinguished by precocious ossification of the jaw suspension, a pattern that is not characteristic of metamorphosing amphibians but which is shared with the viviparous caecilian, Dermophis mexicanus. With few exceptions, cartilages assume their adult configuration from the inception of their development; most larval structures are absent. In short, cranial ontogeny is evolutionarily plastic, as the development of "postmetamorphic" structures is advanced into embryonic and fetal periods. Ontogenetic repatterning in Eleutherodactylus, however, is not correlated with extensive morphological diversification and cannot at this time be causally linked to the evolutionary success of the genus.

Univ. of Illinois, Chicago. The mandible of pigs grows by apposi- tion along its caudal edge. As new bone is added, the periosteum stretches to cover it. In theory, the stretching should be least rostrally, where the bone is not growing, and most caudally, next to the osteogenic border. This prediction was assessed using the tech? nique of Grimm and Katele (1979). Tita- nium granules in gelatin matrix were surgically implanted into the ascending ramus of growing pigs, and distortion due to growth was monitored radiographi- cally. As predicted, the caudal im? plants stretched more than the rostral ones. Further, distortion was usually greater on the lateral side of the man? dible than on the medial, reflecting osseous drift. Since the migration of muscle attachments depends on periosteal movement (Dttrfl, 1980), these findings may explain ontogenetic change in the orientation of the pig masseter muscle. Because muscle fibers inserting caudally should migrate faster, rostral and cau? dal parts of the masseter are expected to become increasingly divergent, as has been observed (Herring and Wineski, 1986).

During anuran metamorphosis, cranial cartilages undergo a profound transformation that also can be induced by exogenous thyroid hormone (TH) in vivo. We tested the effectiveness of TH in mediating these changes in vitro, as well as the degree to which the responses of individual cartilages are site dependent. Explants of upper and lower jaw cartilages of larval fire-bellied toads, Bombina orientalis, were cultured for as many as four days at four dosages of L-triiodothyronine (T3): 0 (control), 1,10, and 100 ng/ml. Response of all cartilages to T3 was dosage dependent The nature of the response, however, varied according to the site of origin in the head and corresponded precisely to the normal fate of each cartilage at metamorphosis; for example, resorption versus remodeling. Tissue sensitivity (e.g., rate of response) also mirrored that seen in vivo. These results further support the hypothesis that thyroid hormone has a direct effect on target tissues, but that the nature of the response is both tissue and site dependent. Moreover, they provide additional evidence that morphogenetic pattern specificity is intrinsic to cranial skeletal tissues.

Univ. of California at Berkeley. Desmognathus aeneus belongs to a subfamily in which the ancestral life history includes an aquatic larval stage, varying in duration from months to years, depending on species. In contrast, D. aeneus has an hatchling which never enters water but has ephemeral gills. Ten clutches of eggs were serially preserved. External morphological features (eyes, limbs, gills, pigmentation) were examined and used to construct a staging table. In D. aeneus, forelimbs develop slightly faster than hindlimbs. In larval plethodontids described in the literature hindlimbs develop much more slowly than forelimbs. In contrast, direct developing plethodontids have simultaneous appearance and development of limbs. Based on a comparison of hatchlings of D. aeneus, D.fuscus and Batrachoseps attenuatus, using the appearance of eyelids and lack of tail fins and substantial gills as criteria, we conclude thatD. aeneus lacks a larval stage and undergoes direct development.

Univ. of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois A specimen from Carboniferous age sediments represents only the second complete example of Limnoscelis. Post- cranial characteristics include well de? veloped processes for muscular attach? ment on stout limbs, and alternation of height and structure of vertebral neural spines. Preserved cranial materials in- ducate the presence of a well developed tabular that extended along the postero- lateral edge of the occiput. A laterally directed parietal lappet does not re? place the intertemporal as in typical reptiles. A dorsolateral "line of weak- ness" between the supratemporal and squamosal was definately present. More teeth are present than was previously as? sumed for this genus. Limnoscelis has been variously classified as a reptile or an amphibian, with problems of tax? onomic assignment compounded by the In? ability to unquestionably demonstrate the presence of an amnion inthe fossil record. This leaves other osteological criteria, but If Limnoscelis is consid- as an amphibian, those typically rep- tilian characteristics associated with advanced degrees of terrestriality may no longer be appropriate. 46 THE PHYLOGENETIC SIGNIFICANCE OF BONE AND TOOTH STRUCTURE IN THE RICEFISHES, ORYZIAS AND ALLIES. L. R. Parenti, California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco. The ricefish Oryzias latipes, commonly known as the medaka, has figured prominently in genetic and developmental studies for nearly a century. In contrast, the phylogenetic position of the medaka and its close relatives has been virtually ignored. Comparative anatomical studies, focusing on the oral jaw and jaw suspensorium and hyoid apparatus, of the ten to fifteen ricefish species has lead to clarification of the phylogenetic position of ricefishes as plesiomorphic beloniform fishes, not as cyprinodontiform or killifishes. Further, the medaka has numerous derived characters, in particular those of its nonprotrusible oral jaw, that must be considered when it is used in other biological studies as a model or "typical" advanced bony fish.

Turtles all possess rigid or semirigid shells that prohibit axial displacement hence, they are unlike other vertebrates that rely on axial movements to produce or enhance the forces necessary for propulsion. In many ways, sea turtie locomotion departs most from the basic patterns used by most other turtie groups. Three patterns have been identified. Powerstroking (forelimb propulsion) is accomplished through sequential use of lift-and drag-based thrust production and is a stroke used by all size classes. Dogpaddling (involving all four limbs) and rear flipper kicking (hindlimbs alone) are primarily drag-based strokes and are only used by young sea turtles. Functional explanations for the maintenance of both lift- and drag-based propulsion include mechanical efficiency, maneuverability and morphological constraints. Ecological differences among size classes may also promote maintenance of the three patterns. 48 FAST-STARTS AND THE DAILY ENERGY BUDGET OF NORTHERN PIKE, ESOX LUCIUS. H.R. Frith and RW.Blake . Univ. of B.C., Vancouver. Fast-starts by fish are high powered but short in duration. The observation that few fast- starts, whether for prey capture or predator es? cape, last longer than 0.5s might be explained by energy limitation. The cost of fast-starts in E. Iuciu3, was directly measured by monitoring the increase in oxygen consumption above resting levels during recovery from fast-starts. Simulta- neous video tapes of the fast-starts were digitised and standard hydrodynamic models used to es? timate the work done by the fish. Results show the cost of fast-starts is 40 times the hydrome- chanical work done. Literature values for white muscle efficiency and propulsive efficiency of fast- starts suggest total swimming efficiency is 1/10 to 1/20 rather than the 1/40 measured here. Pre? vious studies have therefore underestimated the significance of fast-starts to the energy budget of fish. Fast-start activity may contribute between 1 and 5 % of daily energy expenditure for North? ern pike.</page><page sequence="14">14A American Society of Zoologists 49 COMPARATIVE RUNNING ENDURANCE OF BIPEDAL AND QUADRUPEDAL HETEROMYID RODENTS M. Diawdan, Univ. of California, Irvine. The evolution of bipedality has remained something of an open question. Earlier work of mine has indicated that bipedal rodents, as a group, do not have greater maximal running speed than quadrupeds, excepting Dipodomys spp. The present study tests for enhanced endurance among bipedal heteromyid rodents relative to quadrupedal heteromyids. The 4 quadruped species were Perocrnathus lonqimembrjs, ghaetotjpus faUax, Liomys pjctus and Heteromys desmerestianus. The 4 biped species were Microdipodops meaa- cephalusf Dipodomys merriamir D. ordii. and D. deserti. The ani? mals were run to exhaustion on a treadmill using a step test. Endurance was found to scale posi? tively with mass among bipeds, but not among quadrupeds. Biped endu? rance was statistically greater than quadruped endurance. In het? eromyids, bipedality enhances run? ning endurance capacity, relative to quadrupedality. 50 FUNCTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS OF LEG BONE FUSION IN MAMMALS. S.O. Landry. State University of New York, Binghamton. Fusion of the distal ends of leg bones occurs in various mammals, including lagomorphs, muroid and geomyoid rodents, and shrews. These forms are diverse and have no obvious mechanical adaptation In common. However, it is noticable that in all of them, the distal end of the fibula is broadened, apparently to take up a greater proportion of the compressive load passed upward from the ankle. Normally In mammals, the fibula seems to have three tasks: 1) The upper end is the origin of the peroneus muscles; 2) The lower end is the pulley for the change of direction of the peroneus tendons; and 3) the shaft serves as the tensile member of the lower leg. In forms where the lateral edge of the leg must bear weight, the distal end of the fibula solidly fuses with the tibia, and the useless middle portion of the fibula is abandoned. 51 A COMPARISON OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF VERTICAL FORCES ACROSS THE FOUR FEET OF A HORSE IN THREE GAITS. M. L. Hyde, M. H. Ratzlaff*, P. D. Wilson*, O. K. Balch*, &amp; B. D. Grant*. Washington State Univ., Pullraan. The results of our work confirra that most of forward propulsion by a galloping horse is by the rear feet, with front feet acting like "crutches." However, the members of each pair of feet have different roles. Most forward propulsion is by action of the "toe" of the non-lead rear foot. Most toe propulsion by the lead rear foot must overcome the initial "braking" action of the lead fore foot. Highest vertical force of the non-lead front foot occurs during its mid support while peak toe force occurs at mid support of both front feet. The front feet at the trot stay in contact with the ground for a longer time than the rear feet. All feet show a true toe propul? sion with the "heel" of the hoof leaving the ground before peak toe propulsion is reached. Highest toe propulsion occurs on the rear feet. In the walk, most toe propulsive force on each foot counteracts the braking of its contralateral mate.

Jr. Duke Univ., Durham, N.C. The swimming behavior of aquatic vertebrates is, in part, determined by the visco-elastic properties of the intervertebral joints. In order to examine these properties, I have dynamically tested isolated intervertebral joints of several species of carcharhinid shark in a machine designed to vary the frequency of harmonic bending. At various bending frequencies, the force needed to bend the joint throughout a complete harmonic cycle is measured. In some instances, the timing of the maximum force and the maximum bending of the joint do not coincide. This lag time is caused by the viscosity of the joint and results in the applied force doing work over a complete cycle of bending. I have found that the work per cycle for a given joint varies with the frequency of bending. ITius, for the swimming shark there may be energetically important correlations between the frequencies of whole body bending and those frequencies that require little work to bend isolated intervertebral joints.</page><page sequence="15">Abstracts 15 A 53 SOUNDS OF MUSCLES IN MOVING LIMBS 0. Ellers and D.A. Pabst, Duke Univ. Durham, NC 27706 Isometrically contracting muscles are known to emit low frequency sound. We are interested in using sound to census muscle activity and force production in whole animals while they are moving. Recording from the contracting human m. biceps brachii in situ, we find that acoustic behavior depends on shortening speed. When the muscle shortens quickly, it "rings" at 12-17 Hz with a peak amplitude that is independent of muscle loading. Thus, the sounds of rapid contractions yield little information about force production but indicate the timing of the contraction event. When the muscle shortens slowly, there is no "ringing" and the root- mean-square amplitude of the sound varies linearly with muscle loading. Thus, sound amplitude from slow contractions yields information about force production. For both fast and slow contractions frequency varied little and unsystematically with loading. 54 EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE ON MUSCLE ACTIVITY DURING LIZARD LOCOMOTION. B.C. Javne. A.F. Bennett and G.V. Lauder. Univ. California, Irvine. Synchronized electromyography and cinematography were used to determine the activity of the red and white fiber regions within the iliofibularis (IF) muscle of four savanna monitors (Varanus exanthemattcus). Each lizard was tested at 25 and 35?C Tg while it moved on a treadmill at speeds of .3, .6, .9, and 1.2 km/hr. We sampled the electromyograms (EMGs) using 50 ms time bins and analyzed spike number, mean amplitude, spike number times mean amplitude, burst duration and burst area. No postural muscle activity was detectable. During locomotion at all speeds, the red IF had a cyclic bursting pattern of activity correlated with the recovery (swing) phase of limb movement. The white IF displayed no activity at slow speeds, low level activity at moderate speeds or strong activity that correlated with rapid acceleration. For similar speeds, temperature has a significant inverse effect on the EMG amplitude. In light of the thermal dependence of EMG patterns, body temperature must be considered as an important variable in functional studies of muscle activity in vivo.

Michigan, Ann Arbor and Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris. Ophisaurus appflus and Angujs fragUjg were exposed to a series of locomotor tasks involving the transit of smooth surfaces, pins on different spaeings and channels of different widths. Their locomotor patterns show major differences. In general, Ophisaurus moves substantially faster than ftpguis. Its motor coordination involves a continuous sequence of waves traveling from head to tail, whereas Anguis establishes its waves independently on trunk and tail, each commonly showing different synchrony, wave length and amplitude. Ophisaurus practices two kinds of slide pushing, (1) waves on the body and (2) waves on the tail, whereas Anguis only uses caudal propulsion. In undulation, Ophisaurus exerts forces up to its caudal tip whereas this zone is dragged in Anguis. Whereas Ophisaurus would continously traverse even the narrowest spaeings it could oocupy, Anguis stems itself into tight arrays utilizing these as sites into which to (hide) escape.

Implicit in ecomorphological hypotheses are two rarely tested assumptions: 1. that differences in morphology translate into differences in performance capability, which, in turn, result in differences in ecology; and 2. that both morphology and ecology coevolve with performance capability. I have examined these propositions using the Anolis lizards of Jamaica and Puerto Rico. I measured maximum running, jumping, and clinging ability in 16 species. With the effect of size removed, I tested the hypotheses that long-legged species can run and jump further, and that species with large toe pads can cling better. Given existing phylogenetic information, I examined whether morphology and performance ability have coevolved. Similarly, I examined whether differences in performance ability are related to locomotor patterns and microhabitat use. As a generality, these hypotheses were supported, but there were enough exceptions to instill caution in the uncritical acceptance of ecomorphological hypotheses.</page><page sequence="16">16A American Society of Zoologists 57 VARIATIONS IN CRITICAL OXYGEN TENSION DUE TO CHANGES IN SALINITY IN CYPRINODON VARIEGATUS. D.C. Haney. Univ. of Florida, Gainesville. The sheepshead minriow, Cyprinodon variegatus, is a common inhabitant of fresh and brackish waters of coastal areas from northern South America to Cape Cod. Individuals may thus encounter widely varying salinities over a short time course. This study was performed in order to discover if any correlation exists between oxygen requirements and the salinities at which this species can be found. Critical oxygen tension (Pc) measurements were made at 2cPc on individuals of Cyprinodon variegatus after acclimation to salinities of 2ppt, 30ppt and 50ppt. Pc values were determined in a closed system by allowing fish to deplete the oxygen in their container, with measurements of the fall in oxygen tension being made every 30 minutes. Preliminary data indicates that the Pc value at 2ppt and 30ppt is 55 mm Hg, but that at 50ppt the Pc is elevated to 65 mm Hg. This suggests that fish at high salinities are highly vulnerable to decreases in P0? and hence must reduce their general activity and/or reduce expenditures for various homeostatic functions, possibly including osmotic-ionic regulation. 58 THE EFFECTS OF SALINITY ACCLIMATION ON THE METABOLISM OF THE OYSTER, Crassostrea virginica L SL Ballantvne and L.

Hexokinase (HK), pyruvate kinase (PK), fructose bisphosphatase (FBPase), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT), glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), citrate synthase (CS), carnitine octanoyl transferase (COT), carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT), hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD), acetoacetyl CoA thiolase (ACT), 3-oxoacid transferase (OAT) and hydroxy- methylglutaryl CoA lyase (HMGCL) were measured in gill, adductor muscle, hepatopancreas and mantle of oysters acclimated for at least one month to full strength seawater (1000 mOsm/1) (FSW) or one third strength seawater (333 mOsm/1) (LSW). Where changes occurred with LSW acclimation these always resulted in a decline in enzyme activity. In particular HK, FBPase and HOAD activities declined in LSW acclimated groups in hepatopancreas, and gill, HOAD de? clined in LSW acclimated adductor muscle and HK and FBPase declined in LSW acclimated mantle. These findings are consistent with the concept of maintenance of metabolic function in an osmoconformer at different salinities. Lower activities of these enzymes help offset the enhanced activity induced by lower intracellular ionic strength. 59 VOLUME REGULATION IN THE SEA ANEMONE METRIDIUM SENILE. L. E. Deaton and R. J. Hoffmann. Univ. of Southwestern Louisiana, Lafayette and Iowa State Univ. Ames. Metridium senile survives at least two weeks in osmolalities ranging from 950 to 520 mOsm and dies in 380 mOsm. Tissue hydration increases from 77 to 85% in M. senile acclimated to dilute media, but the increase is not proportional to the decrease in the ambient osmolality, indi? cating that regulation of cellular volume occurs in these animals. The tissue amino acid content of M. senile accli? mated to 950, 807, 665, and 520 mOsm for two weeks is, respectively, 440, 380, 330 and 250 umol/g dry weight. A decrease in the level of taurine accounts for nearly all of the reduetion in the free amino acid pool. Quantitative analysis of data for changes in tissue hydration in ane? mones exposed to dilute media suggest that the effectiveness of volume regula? tion increases in M. senile, Halliplenel- la lineata, and Diadumene leucolena, but not in Bunodosoma cavernata when indi? viduals of these species are acclimated to progressively more dilute media. 60 CHANGES IN HEMOLYMPH VOLUME IN MYTILUS EDULIS SUBJECTED TO OS? MOTIC STRESS. L.F. Gainev. Jr. Univ of Southern Maine, Portland. Changes in hemolymph volume and urine production were mea? sured using C1*' polyethylene gly- col (PEG). Mussels were injected with 1 uCi of PEG and allowed to equilibrate for 24 to 36 hours. Hemolymph samples were removed from the posterior adductor muscle at appropriate intervals. When mussels were transferred from 600 to 300 mOsm, hemolymph volumes increased for 12 hours. The experimental group had hemolymph volumes 100% above the control group. There were no differences in rates of PEG clearance except at 6 hours, when the experimental group was siginificantly greater than the control group. When mussles were transferred from 300 to 600 mOsm, hemolymph volume decreased to a minumum of 53% +_ 21 (mean +_ se) . Within 24 hours after the osmotic stress, there was no difference between the experimental and con? trol groups. In additon, there were no differences in PEG clear? ance between the 2 groups.</page><page sequence="17">Abstracts 17A 61 CELLULAR WATER CONTENT AND HEMO? LYMPH COMPOSITION IN JUVENILE EYESTALK-ABLATED LOBSTERS. S.A. Jackson, M. J. Bruce*, E.S. Chang and J.S. Clegg*. Bodega Marine Laboratory, Univ. of California, Bodega Bay. Tissue and cell water content was measured in abdominal muscle and hepatopancreas in eyestalk- ablated (EA) and intact juvenile lobsters (Homarus americanus). Both parameters were significantly higher in EA lobsters. Eyestalk ablation increased extracellular space and total hemolymph volume. A decrease in hemolymph density and dry solids not accounted for by simple dilution was attributed to a decrease in protein concentration, probably hemocyanin, equivalent to that seen in early postmolt intact lobsters. EA lobsters maintained hemolymph osmotic pressure and Na+, K+ and Cl" concentrations at intact levels. These data indicate that removal of the eyestalk X-organ- sinus gland neurosecretory complex results in increased water content in cells of at least two tissues and leads to the disappearance and/or inhibition of synthesis of hemolymph proteins. 62 WATER LOSS AND OXYGEN CONSUMPTION OF CHINESE MANTIS EQG CASES. G.F. Birchard and J.E. Skog. Dept. of Biology, George Mason Univ., Fairfax, VA. Eggs of the Chinese mantis (Tenodera aridifolia senesis) are laid in late summer and fall, overwinter then develop and hatch in the spring. During this period the egg cases must conserve water and exchange adequate amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide to ensure the development and growth of the young. Water vapor conductance K+I20)i oxygen consumption (M02), internal case temperature and morphology (by SEM) of egg cases were examined. Mean case weight was 1.802 g. Water exchange appears to be by simple diffusion. Water loss was not altered by increases in convective air flow. Gh20 at 19 c was ?-319 fflg-o"1- torr-1. Photomicrographs indicate that the major resistance to H2O loss lies at the imer egg chamber. M02 and inner case temperature (at 25 C) increased linearly with development time. For an egg case producing 1 g of hatchling mass (about 260 young) peak Mq2 was 538.6 ul-rr*. Just prior to hatching inner egg case temperature was 0,34 C above ambient. Calculations show inner case PO2 to be quite high and that excepting severe, prolonged dessication excess water loss should not occur. 63 WATER LOSS AND AN EXTRAEPIDERMAL LIPID BARRIER IN THE AUSTRALIAN TREEFROG LITORIA CAERULEA. K. Christian , D. Parry*, and B. Green*. University College of the Northern Territory, Darwin, NT, Australia and CSIRO Wildlife Research, Canberra, ACT, Australia, Evaporative water loss from resting Litoria caerulea was measured in a flow-through system. The frogs were found to have low rates of water loss relative to most species of frogs (7.3 mg g h and 5.6 mg cm h ). Water turnover rates were measured using tritiated water under natural conditions in free-ranging frogs during the wet season and under semi-natural conditions in the dry season. Low rates of water loss are attributed to an extraepidermal lipid barrier secreted by the frogs. Frogs were observed wiping the secretions over their dorsal surfaces using their legs. Secretions were gently rinsed off the frogs with distilled water, lyopilized, and extracted by a Folch extraction. The secretions were 30% lipid, and these were analyzed for neutral and polar fractions and the fatty acids were analyzed with gas chromatography. The extraepidermal lipid barrier is compared to that of Phyllomedusine frogs. 64 COMPARISON OF THE SURFACE AREA OF PELVIC AND PECTORAL REGIONS OF TOAD SKIN USING IMPEDANCE ANALYSIS. S. D. Hillyard. Dept. Biology, Univ. Nevada, Las Vegas, NV 89154 Epidermal sculpturing facilitates substrate moisture absorption across skin in the pelvic region of bufonids. The degree to which this sculpturing increases surface area, relative to skin in the pectoral region, was eval- uated with impedance analysis. In this technique isolated skin is placed in an Ussing chamber and short-circuit current is applied with a voltage clamp. A fluctuating signal is then imposed on the command voltage of the clamp and the phase relationship between the voltage and current fluctuations is determined over a broad range of frequencies. The extent to which current fluctuations follow voltage fluctuations permits cal- culation of the capacitance of the tis? sue which was found to be 4.5 uFarads (uF)/cm2 for the pelvic and 1.5 uF/cm2 for the pectoral skin. Since cell mem? branes typically have a capacitance of 1 uF/cm2, it appears that epidermal sculpturing increases the absorptive area of the pelvic skin threefold rel? ative to the pectoral skin.

Univ. of Florida, Gainesville, FL. Intracellular pH (pHi) was determined using the 1J*C-DMO/3H-inulin technique in nerve, skeletal and cardiac muscle, antennal gland, and carapace in control normoxic crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and after hyperoxia (500 torr) and normoxic recovery. Previous work had shown that control extracellular pH (pHe-7.8) initially (3 h) experienced a respira? tory acidosis (0.2 units) which was progressive? ly (36 h) compensated by metabolic [HCOJ accumulation (30%). The reverse sequence of events occurred on recovery. Nerve pHi, which had a control value close to pHe, remained constant throughout. The other soft tissues, where control pHe-pHi was around 0.3 units, exhibited an initial hyperoxic acidosis (5 h) composed of both respiratory and non- respiratory components, and varying in magni? tude from 0.2-0.8 units. Within 48 h pHi, like pHe, was metabolically corrected in these tissues. Intracellular acid-base status was rapidly reinstated upon recovery. Control carapace pHi was 0.3 units alkaline to pHe and remained constant although [HCOJ increased initially. Whole body pHi was influenced by the pHi in carapace fluid since it constituted 1/3 of total body water.

George Mason University, Fairfax,Va &amp; Southeastern Louisiana U., Hammond, LA. An in vitro system was used to deter? mine buffer values and the effect of Ca++ on the equilibration rate (at 25 C) of hemolymph from blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus and crayfish, Procambarus clarki. These were also compared to several other species with very different hemolymph composition. Hemolymph was dialyzed against saline of known Ca++ concentration (0 to 50 mM) and then equilibrated with gas of known Pco_. All hemolymph samples required at least 20 min to reach a stable equilibrium, with a definite difference in the time required for each of the individual variables: pH, Pco- and Cco2. After dialysis against saline with no Ca++, the equilibration time was substantially shortened. When Ca++ was increased to 50 mM, equilibration time more than doubled, to nearly 1 h. Both crab abd crayfish hemolymph displayed the same pattern. We suggest that the addition of Ca++ extends the time for the reaction because of the formation of ion pairs between Ca++ and HCO..-.

Desert Island Biol. Lab., Salsbury Cove, ME, Southwestern College, Winfield, KS, Univ. of Richmond, VA, Univ. of North Carolina, Asheville, and Lake Forest College, IL. A possible relationship between ammonia excretion and Na+/H+ exchange was investigated in the rock crab Cancer irroratus. Ammonia excretion was inhibited approximately 45$ by 1 x 10"^ M amiloride added to the external medium, indicating that functional Na+/H+ exchange may be required for excretion of ammonia. Ammonia excretion increased more than 5-fold during acclimation to 60$ seawater, reaching a maximum rate at 12-24 hours after transfer and returning to control values within 96 hours. Blood pH increased over the same interval, but remained slightly elevated at 96 hours. Six-hour air exposure led to a marked reduetion in blood pH, which returned to nearly normal values within 12 hours of reimmersion. Neither acclimation to diluted seawater or three cycles of air exposure and reimmersion affected Na+/H+ exchange activity in gill membrane vesicles. The Na+/H+ exchanger may be constitutively expressed rather than responding to ammonia or acid loads.

Lab., Salsbury Cove, ME, Lake Forest College, IL, South? western College, Winfield, KS, Univ. of Richmond, VA and Univ. of Bergen, Norway. The NaVH* antiporter of green crab (CarcJlnus maenas) gill is electrogenic, apparently exchanging 2 Na+ for 1 H+, unlike the electroneutral Na+/H+ antiporter in vertebrates. In the present study, the prevalence of 2:1 stoichiometry among crab species was investigated. Na+/H+ exchange was measured in membrane vesicles by acridine orange fluorescence. Response of exchange activity to extravesicular sodium was hyperbolic in LJbinla dtibia (spider crab) but sigmoid in Callinectes sapj-tius (blue crab), Cancer irroratus (rock crab) and Cancer borealis (Jonah crab). Hill plots indicated a Na+/H+ exchange stoichio? metry of 1:1 for Libinia but 2:1 for Callinectes and Cancer species. The electrogenic Na"*7H+ antiporter is thus present in gills of both osmoregulators (Carcinus and Callinectes) and osmocon- formers (Cancer species), indicating that electrogenicity of NaVlf*" exchange is not a unique property of osmoregulators.

Eastern Connecticut State Univ., Willlmantlc. During locomotor activity blue crabs compensate for a lactacidosis by the net excretion of H+ (3-5 meq/kg/h) to the ambient seawater (SW). Net H+ excretion has two components: Titratable H+ efflux (TA0Ut) and ammonia efflux (Amout)- During exercise Am0ut is elevated 5-7 X over resting levels and is independent of ambient [Na+]. TA0ut decreases with a reduction in [Na+] and is depressed by 75% in Na+-free artificial SW. TAout is abolished during exercise in artificial SW lacking both Na+ and HCO3" and is restored upon return to SW with normal levels of these ions. These results support putative branchial Na+/H+ and CIVHCO3" exchanges as the mechanisms responsible for TA0Ut during exercise. The Na+- independence of Am0ut and calculations of ammonia diffusion gradients suggest that Am0ut during exercise occurs by simple diffusion of NH4+, rather than by NH3 diffusion or Na+/NH4+ exchange. 70 CIRCADIAN RHYTHM EXPRESSED BY THE SHORT- CIRCUIT CURRENT OF THE KILLIFISH OPERCULUM. J.I. Scheide. Mt. Desert Island Biol. Lab., Salsbury Cove, ME; NYU Med. Ctr., NY and Dept. Biology, Central Michigan Univ., Mt. Pleasant, Ml. The inner opercular lining of the killlfish, Fundulus heteroclitus, may be separated as a single epithelial sheet and mounted in an Ussing-style chamber with the short-circuit current (Isc) approximating chloride secretion. Steady state opercular Isc values in seawater adapted killifish were higher in the afternoon. Morning values were 92.8 + 8.9 uA/cm2 while paired afternoon values were 135.4 ? 17.8 uA/cm2 (P&lt;0.05, n-21). Opercular conductance was also higher in the afternoon (12.8 ? 0.9 and 16.4 ? 1.5 mS/cra2 AM and PM respectively, P&lt;0.05). The steady state Isc from killifish on a 14:10 light:dark cycle exhibited a daily circadian variation (ANOVA, F-21.5, P&lt;0.01) with a peak In the middle of the light cycle and a nadir near the end of the dark phase. Temperature and salinity remained constant during the experimental period. The daily variation in the Isc presumably represents the result of hormonal factors. Daily variation cued by the photoperiod should be considered when using this preparation as an experimental model for the gill. 71 CHARACTERISTICS OF BASOLATERAL ACETATE TRANSPORT IN THE TELEOST INTESTINE. ?,. ?,. Titus and ?_?. 4^ Aheam. Univ. Hawaii, Honolulu. Transport properties of 3H-acetate by isolated intestinal basolateral membrane vesicles of the herbivorous teleost, Oreochromis mossambicus. were studied. The time course of 3H-acetate uptake was similar in the presence of inwardly- directed 100 mM Na+, K+, and TMA+ gradients, suggesting the absence of cation\acetate co-transport. Trans- stimulation of 2.5 mM 3H-acetate influx occurred in vesicles preloaded with 50 mM acetate or bicarbonate, but not 50 mM gluconate, suggesting the presence of an anion-exchange mechanism. Trans- stimulation of 3H-acetate influx was observed with intravesicular bicarbonate, acetate, propionate and butyrate, whereas chloride, succinate and oxalate were without significant effect. Cis- inhibition of 3H-acetate influx occurred with external bicarbonate, acetate, propionate and butyrate while little or no inhibition occurred in the presence of chloride, oxalate, succinate and pyruvate. These data suggest a possible anion antiport mechanism shared by short chain fatty acids and bicarbonate in the basolateral membrane of the herbivorous teleost.

The amount and exchange rate of ions between blood plasma and skeleton were examined in tilapia and goldfish under stress condi? tions. Mg2+ levels in plasma and in hard tissues were measured at 1, 2 and 4 wks post Mg2+ stress and/or starvation. After 1-2 wks,the total plasma Mg2+content was greater in tilapia than in controls. A lower Mg2+ level was found in vertebrae, operculum and scale. No change in Mg content was observed in gold? fish. The diffusible plasma Mg2 + level of starved tilapia and goldfish decreased compared to fed animals when both were kept in various Mg2+waters. By the 4th wk, total and diffusible plasma Mg levels of tilapia and goldfish were greater in stressed than in the control fish. While a decrease of content was found in vertebrae and operculum. These data suggest that both acellular and cellular bgned fishes are able to mobilized Mg2+ ions from different parts of their skeletal tissues during stress conditions.</page><page sequence="20">20A American Society of Zoologists 73 PEP BRANCHPOINT ENZYMES IN THE RIBBED MUSSEL MODIOLUS DEMISSUS. M.A. Kapper, _S. Harlocker, and S.H. Bishop. Iowa State University, Ames. When marine molluscs are challenged by a hyperosmotic stress, they typically respond by increasing the intracellular concentration of free amino acids. In the ribbed mussel, Modiolus demissus, the transamination of pyruvate leads to an initial accumulation of alanine, while glycine, proline and taurine accumulate with time. We have examined the kinetics of two enzymes that control carbon flux through PEP, pyruvate kinase (PK) and phospho(enol)pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). Two factors appear to be the major controlling elements at the PEP branchpoint. First, the pH for maximal PK activity is at 7.5, while the forward (oxaloacetate-forming) direction of PEPCK shows maximal activity at pH 6.6. The shape of the pH-activity profiles sug? gests that as the intracellular pH changes, the activity of the two enzymes is altered in a reciprocal manner. Second, PK activity is strongly inhibited by the accumulating alanine (Ki=0.5mM). The increasing alanine concentration does not affect PEPCK activity, tending to shift carbon flux away from pyruvate towards oxaloacetate.

R.G.Sarver*, M.A.Flynn* and C.W.Holliday.Lafayette College, Easton, PA Freshwater crayfish are hyperosmotic regulators in their natural environment; they actively transport salts into the blood at the gills and make a copious, dilute urine. If the renal sodium pump (Na,K-ATPase) functions in production of dilute urine, then antennal gland Na,K- ATPase enzyme specific activity (ESA) should increase in conditions causing production of progressively more concen- trated urine(e.g., acclimation in various dilutions of sea water). Antennal gland ESA was characterized for optimal pH, ion and substrate concentrations. Antennal gland ESA was measured in crayfish accli? mated 2 weeks in fresh water, 25%, 50% and 75% sea water(SW). As medium osmo- lality increased, urine and blood osmo- lalities increased; urine was nearly is? osmotic with blood in 75% SW. Concomi- tantly, antennal gland.ESA fell from 49.2 ?2.5(10) to 39.7?1.7(16) umoles Pi X mg"1 protein X h"1 in 75% SW. These results are consistent with our hypothesis. The relatively small decrease in ESA may re- flect the proportion of total gland ESA which powers urinary salt reabsorption. The remaining ESA may reflect Na-linked processes powering renal reabsorption of sugars and amino acids and secretion of organic acids and bases.

Scripps Institution of Oceanography, La Jolla CA Na-K-ATPase activities were measured in gills of 12 marine teleost species from various depths (0- 3000m) and lifestyles (benthic, pelagic, and midwater), spanning 5 orders of magnitude in size. Within a given species, Na-K-ATPase activity per gram of fish decreased with size, with an average scaiing coefficient of b=-Q.17. Na-K-ATPase per gram of gill tissue was constant. Deep-sea fish had lower enzyme activities than shallow species, reflecting their reduced metabolism. The differences are accentuated when ATPase activities are corrected for the effects of low temperature and high pressure. We conclude that the cost of osmoregulation (as estimated by Na-K- ATPase activity) in marine teleosts is directly related to overall metabolic rate. 76 MORPHOLOGICAL &amp; BIOCHEMICAL ADAPTATIONS TO ANHYDROBIOSIS IN ARTIFICIALLY &amp; NATURALLY DEHYDRATED POPULATIONS OF DITYLENCHUS MYCELIOPHAGUS (NEMATODA). C. Womersley, Univ. of Hawaii, Honolulu. If dehydrated slowly the free-living mycophagous nematode Ditylenchus myce- liophagus is able to survive anhydro- biotically. We have compared the morphological and biochemical changes associated with the induction of anhy- drobiosis either by exposing the nematodes to 97% relative humidity (r.h.) or by allowing them to dehydrate naturally in culture over a period of 6-9 weeks. All nematodes clumped and coiled during dehydration, Nematodes cultured on Agaricus bisporus mycelia and exposed to 97% r.h. for 3 days decreased lipid and glycogen contents, and increased trehalose levels to ca. 2.5%/dry wt. In contrast nematodes cultured on Rhizoctonia cerealis decreased lipid and glycogen contents, but trehalose levels were elevated to ca. 9%/dry wt. Nematodes cultured on R^ cerealis and subjected to more natural dehydration regimes showed an initial increase in lipid content, but this declined to ca. 23%/dry wt. after 6 weeks. Trehalose levels increased to about 15%/dry wt. after 3 weeks. Glyco? gen and glycerol levels decreased.</page><page sequence="21">Abstracts 21A 77 GALLIFORM CECAL ULTRASTRUCTURE. T.R. Strong, ?.R.

Cellular and subcellular structures, including epithelial cell height, mitochondrial density, microvillar surface area, and tight junction lengths, were quantified. Epithelial cell heights were greater in each cecal region of the fowl than in corresponding regions of the quail. There were no significant differences in mitochondrial density. In the fowl ceca, the proximal region had greater microvillar surface area than the middle or distal regions. In the quail ceca, tight junctions were shortest in the middle region, but in the fowl, junctions were shortest in the proximal region. The quail ceca appear to have a greater capacity for absorption by passive diffusion than the fowl ceca.

The University of Texas Marine Science Institute, Port Aransas. The bacteria Vibrio anguillarum can cause serious disease problems in fishes, however little is known about the physiological effects of the extracellular toxins produced by this pathogen. An extracellular toxin was isolated from a cell-free culture filtrate of V. anguillarum and partially purified by DEAE- cellulose chromatography. Two groups of juvenile red drum were injected intraperitoneally with the partially purified toxin at a concentration of 6.25ug protein/g. This was half the lethal dose of the toxin in red drum. The injections caused severe physiological dysfunction in fish groups bled at 6 and 24 hours shown by a hypoglycemia and decreases in osmolality and concentrations of sodium, potassium, and chloride ions. Plasma cortisol concentrations also increased in the group sampled at 24 hours. The results suggest that the physiological dysfunction caused by the toxin could play an important role in the pathogenicity of Vibrio anguillarum in red drum. 79 PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES OF GHOST SHRIMP TO CARBARYL AND 1-NAPHTHOL. Patricia S. Estes and A. W. Pritchard. Oregon State Univ. Carbaryl (Sevin) has been applied to commercial oyster beds in N.W. estuaries to control burrowing activities of the ghost shrimp, Callianassa californiensis. Concentrations of Carbaryl and its hydro? lytic product 1-Naphthol causing 50% of the animals to lose equilibrium in 24 hrs (ECc0) were .082 and 3.52 mg/L respec? tively, indicating greater sensitivity to the parent compound. In this study we investigate effects of levels of Carbaryl and 1-Naphthol near the EC50 on heart and scaphognathite (Sc) frequency, deter? mined by the method of impedance. Signif? icant elevation in Sc frequency was ob? served in carbaryl-treated animals, fol? lowed by decline towards control levels during the post treatment period. Sc fre? quency was elevated, but not significant? ly, in 1-naphthol-treated animals. Neither carbaryl nor 1-naphthol treatment signifi? cantly altered heart rate, although in the carbaryl-treated group it was significant? ly above control levels throughout the post treatment period. Metabolic rates of ghost shrimp are quite low. Persistence of carbaryl in mudflats, by increasing heart and respiratory activity, may leave these animals unable to successfully cope with their hypoxic environment. 80 EYESTALK ABLATION EFFECTS ON BIOCHEMICAL CHANGES IN HAEMOLYMPH DURING REPRODUCTIVE CYCLE OF MALE FRESHWATER CRAB, BARYTEL- PHUSA GUERINI. N.Vasantha, M.G.Hussain* and S.A.T.Venkatachari. Nizam College, Hyderabad. and Gulbarga Univ., Gulbarga India. Following 15 days of eyestalk ablation, total free sugars, glycogen, proteins, lipids and RNA decreased during all phases while free amino acids increased in prereproductive phase and decreased during reproductive and postreproductive phases of the annual reproductive cycle. Decrease in free sugars and glycogen is correlated to depletion of hyperglycemic hormone and decrease in proteins and RNA to decreased rate of protein synthesis. Increase in free amino acids during pre? reproductive stage may be due to protein mobilization and decrease in lipids may be due to their utilization during active spermatogenesis. Enhanced gonadal activity due to release of active principle from brain and thoracic ganglionic mass as a result of removal of gonad inhibiting factor through eyestalk ablation may explain depletion of organic constituents in blood during different phases of the reproductive cycle.</page><page sequence="22">22A American Society of Zoologists 81 p-AMINOHIPPURIC ACID UPTAKE INTO LOBSTER HEPATOPANCREAS BASOLATERAL MEMBRANE VESICLES.

Caldwell and J.F. Henderson. (intro. by L. Wang). Univ. of Al? berta, Edmonton. Guanine is endproduct of nitrogen metabolism in most ter? restrial chelicerates. This study asked if guanine is produced by L. polyphemus. the oldest extant marine chelicerate. Digestive diverticula of immature adults contained large white masses located anterodorsally beneath the ocellus, encircling the esophagus/gizzard, an- teroventrally in the subfrontal area and ventral sense organ, and laterally beneath the diver- ticular lobes. Deposits were ex? tracted with perchloric acid. Liquid chromatography indicates that guanine is the principal ultraviolet absorbing compound present. Uric acid and xanthine are absent. Studies using radioactive precursors are in progress. These results demonstrate a biochemical relationship with terrestrial chelicerates and establish the process of guanine deposition prior to terrestrialization. 83 INFLUENCES OF DIET ON pH WITHIN THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM OF THE FIELD CRICKET, TELEOGRYLLUS COMMODUS. P.D. Cooper. Australian National Univ., Canberra, Australia. The digestive process in insects varies among the different insect orders. Generalists such as cockroaches and crickets have distinctive gut segments which may play various roles in digestion. The digestive process of the black field cricket of Australia (Teleogryllus commodus) has been studied to determine the pH of the various parts of the digestive system. The crop pH differs between fed and unfed animals (5.16 ? 0.30 and 6.41 ? 0.36, respectively). The muscular proventriculus is lined with grinding teeth-like structures and is usually neutral or slightly alkaline in both fed and unfed animals (7.25 ? 0.24). The short midgut lying just posterior to the proventriculus is alkaline in both fed and unfed insects (8.01 ? 0.15). The caeca pH is slightly more alkaline in fed insects (7.74 ? 0.24 compared to 7.47 ? 0.14 for unfed animals). This work suggests that digestion may be initiated by the crop or salivary glands by acidfying the food, which is then neutralized within the proventriculus, probably by secretions from the caeca or midgut. This process does not appear to be influenced by the diet on which the crickets were fed (lab chow, fish flakes or grass) although the buffering capacities of the different diets probably influenced the activity of the pH adjusting mechanism(s). The mechanism of control of pH in the digestive system is currently under investigation. This research is supported by ARGS. 84 CARBON DIOXIDE MODULATES ENERGY METABOLISM IN A DORMANT MOLLUSC M. Christopher Barnhart. Physiological Research Laboratory, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, La Jolla Interest in mechanisms of metabolic rate control during dormancy has focused on change of acid-base balance. Many air-breathing vertebrates, arthropods, and snails accumulate carbon dioxide and consequently experience low pH during periods of dormancy. However, direct evidence for CO2 or pH influence on metabolic rate in these systems is lacking. In land snails (Otala lactea) blood PCO2 increases 4-fold and pH consequently decreases 0.4 units on entering dormancy, coincident with 85% reduetion of aerobic metabolism. I prevented the normal accumulation of CO2 by exposing dormant snails to hypoxia, thus inducing hyperventilation. Blood PCO2 decreased, pH increased, and oxygen consumption increased up to 4- fold. The Increase of oxygen consumption was reversed by adding CO2 to the hypoxic gas and thereby restoring blood pH and PCO2 to normal dormant levels. These results provide the first direct evidence that CO2 retention plays a role in metabolic rate control during dormancy.</page><page sequence="23">Abstracts 23 A 85 PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPENSATION AND AIR EXPOSURE IN A TROPICAL INTERTIDAL CHITON. B.R. McMahon1, W.W. Burggren2, A.W. Pinder2, M.G. Wheatly3. biological Sciences, U. of Calgary, 2Zoology, U. of Mass and 3U. of Florida, Gainesville. Chiton stokesi BRODERIP were obtained from an exposed beach on Naos Island, Panama. Intertidal distribution, variation in body vs. ambient temperature and mean natural emersion time were studied Tin situ'. Construction of an artificial tidal environment in the laboratory facilitated measurement of:-tissue water content; oxygen, C02, and ion levels and osmolarity in venous hemolymph; oxygen consumption (M02); heart rate and intracardiac pressure and variation in flux of acid-base equivalents and ammonia into the ambient water; prior to, during and following natural and maximum tolerable (16h.) emersion at 30?C. This temperature is equivalent to mean environmental temperature measured during air exposure. Venous oxygen levels increased and no significant decrease in M02 resulted from 16h air exposure. Strategies for the survival of this Chiton in the tropical intertidal are discussed. 86 PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES OF THE CHITON STENOPLAX CONSPICUA TO AIR EXPOSURE. U_ Burnett, D. Scholnick*, S. Norenberq* and I. Gallion . Univ. of San Diego. The conspicuous chiton inhabits the intertidal zone where during low tide they become exposed to the air. Ouring this time the chitons become inactive. Since little has been done on the effects of air exposure on the acid-base status of molluscan body fluids we decided to investigate this phenomenon in a local species. All experiments were done at 20?C. Mean oxygen uptake during the first hour of air exposure decreased to 0.0062 umol'g""1-min~1f or 21.1% of the value in immersed animals. Mean hemolymph pH changed from 7.537 (?0.009 s.e.m., N=15) in immersed animals to 7.329 (?0.038 s.e.m., N=11) in animals air exposed for 12 hours. This acidosis is caused entirely by an increase in hemolymph Pcoj from 0.6 to 1.4 torr. There is no evidence for compensation of this purely respiratory acidosis for up to 12 hours. Hemolymph osmotic and ion concentrations increased during the 12 hour period of emersion: 1106 to 1326 mOsm/kg, 470 to 563 mmol-L"1 Na+, 503 to 600 C1-, and 14.4 to 15.6 Ca++.

Townsend. Univ. of Massachusetts, Amherst, and Univ. of Scranton, PA. Coquies undergo metamorphosis within the egg, finally emerging as juvenile frogs. Heart rate (fu), oxygen uptake (Iv102), vitelline fluid pH and [lactate] were measured as a function of development at 25?C. fu, counted under a dissecting microscope, doubled from 50 to 100 beats/minute (bpm) during the first days of heart function. fu increased more slowly across later development, reaching 120 bpm at hatching, then slowly decreasing with further adult growth. IvIOp, measured using closed system respiromefry, ranged from 5 to 10 mmol/kg-hr for eggs, and in adults decreased as a function of increasing size. Vitelline fluid pH was measured by puncturing eggs with a micro pH electrode. pH in hydrated eggs decreased from 5.2 in early development to 4.7 prior to hatching. Egg dehydration caused a significant decrease in pH and was accompanied by a significant increase in fy. Whole egg [lactate] ranged from 0.004 to 0.012 mg/egg, but increased sharply to 0.037 mg/animal in hatchlings.

Univ. of California, Los Angeles, and Univ. of Texas Marine Science Institute, Port Aransas. The formation of novel proteins is an energetically expensive process. It has been suggested that an increase in the rate of protein synthesis is responsible for the increase in oxygen consumption observed following feeding (SDA). A mixture of amino acids equivalent to a 4% ration was infused into chronically catheterized Channel Catfish, Ictalurus punctatus. to simulate a meal. Protein synthesis rates were determined by measuring the incorporation of tritiated phenylalanine into various tissues. Oxygen consumption rates doubled, while the fractional rate of protein synthesis approximately trebled in magnitude. The theoretical cost of protein synthesis in terms of ATP consumption and oxygen consumption was determined. The increased synthesis appears to account for the majority of SDA. This offers further evidence that SDA represents the cost of growth.

Hatchling snapping turtles were maintained constantly at their mean selected temperature (28?) or in a fluctuating temperature regime ( 8 hrs Q 28? : 16 hrs Q 18?) for 36 weeks. Hatchlings with a mean body mass of 7.64g measured at 28? had a baseline mean respiration rate of 91.5/il/g/hr. Eighteen weeks later hatchlings, mean body mass 13.7g, maintained at fluctuating temperature had a mean respiration rate of 137.A jjl/g/hr, whereas the mean respiration rate of hatchlings, mean body mass 11.lg, maintained at constant temperature was 51.9^il/g/hr. Turtles under fluctuating temperature regimes consumed slightly more food and consistently gained moremass than those under the constan regime. No differences in thyroid histology, T^ plasma levels or hematocrits were observed between hatchlings in the two temperature regimes over 36 weeks of the study.

The metabolic rate of pregnant female spiny rats was determined in a flow through system, Measurements were made prior to conception and every 7 days following insemination until parturition, approximately 38 days, The equation obtained for the oxygen consumption was Y=912?67+ 35.^X-0.68(X)2. Mass independent oxygen consumption increased $1% from a RMR of ,912L/day for nonpregnant rats to 1.38L/day at day 26 of pregnancy and declined thereafter to 1.285L/day on the last day of gestation, Mass specific oxygen consumption increased slightly to day 14 of gestation and fell from .0l8ml/g/min to ,013ml/g/min by the end of the gestation period, The average litter size was 2,3 the average weight per neonate was 6,6gt Total cost of gestation as well as the cost of producing one gram of neonate of this precocial rodent species will be compared to a similar sized altricial species. 91 INFLUENCE OF VOLUNTARY EXERCISE ON BODY COMPOSITION AND METABOLISM IN THE HOUSE MOUSE AND GOLDEN HAMSTER. S.H. Scheck. Loyola Marymount Univ., Los Angeles, CA. Studies on energy metabolism of small mammals often are conducted on animals reared in the laboratory. Typically, animals are housed in cages which do not provide an outlet for normal strenuous activity (e.g., running). Therefore, the effects of access to voluntary exercise (wheel running) on body composition and basal metabolism were examined in Mus musculus and Mesocricetus auratus reared in the laboratory. Further, metabolism in mice below thermoneutrality and survivability of hamsters in hibernation were examined. While significant differences were noted between body composition in exercised and sedentary groups of each species, no differences were found in metabolic rates. Also, although 75 % of the surviving hamsters at 64 days cold exposure (4 C) were from the voluntary exercise group, mean length of survival was not significantly different. 92 EFFECT OF DAY LENGTH ON THE PINEAL MELATONIN RHYTHM OF A LIZARD. H. Underwood and L.L. Hyde. North "Carolina State Univ., Raleigh. Photoperiod, acting via the pineal hormone, melatonin, is an important cue for both annual and daily cycles in the lizard Anolis carolinensis. A systematic study was conducted on the influence of photoperiod duration (LD 6:18, LD 8:16, LD 10:14, LD 12:12, LD 14:10, LD 16:8, LD 18:6) on the pineal melatonin rhythm (PMR) in Anolis. The phase of the PMR relative to the LD cycle was markedly affected by photoperiod duration. The peak of the PMR showed a systematic change as the length of the photoperiod decreased; the PMR peaked well before dusk on LD 18:6, around middark on LD 12:12, and late in the dark on LD 6:18. The duration of the PMR was not as markedly influenced by photoperiod duration; however, the PMR duration was shorter on LD 6:18 and LD 8:16 as com? pared to longer photoperiods. The maximum amplitude of the PMR tended to lie in the range of 300-400 pg/pineal under all of the various LD cycles. The effects of photoperiod duration on the PMR in Anolis are in contrast to those observed in some higher vertebrates.</page><page sequence="25">Abstracts 25A 93 ALTERATIONS IN MATERNAL REGULATORY BE? HAVIORS AND PLACENTAL TRANSPORT IN EN? VIRONMENTAL STRESSED RATS. E.D. Lephart, R.W. Rhees* and D.E. Fleming*. UT South- western Medical Center, Dallas, TX., and Brigham Young Univ., Provo, UT. Exposing pregnant rats to environmental (immobilization-illumination-heat) stress has deleterious effects on prenatal dev- lopment. This study examined the nature and time course of prenatal stress with respect to: 1) maternal regulatory be? haviors, and 2) placental transport of a non-metabolizable glucose (2-Deoxy-D-(lH^) glucose) in rats. Animals were subjected to environmental stress three times daily during the third trimester of pregnancy, (days 14-20). Maternal weight and food intake in prenatally stressed animals were significantly below control values during the stress exposure interval (0800- 1700), whereas, placental and fetal weight and glucose transport into these compart? ments were significantly decreased. Our findings suggest that the deficiencies in fetal growth of prenatally stressed rats may be due to: a) temporally distinct re- ductions in maternal weight and food in? take, and b) alterations in maternal-fetal transport of glucose. These abberrant per? inatal nutritional factors may affect sub- sequent maturation and behavior. 94 TRICHOSTRONGYLUS COLUBRIFORMIS (NEMATODA) INFECTION IN NORMAL AND ZINC-DEFICIENT GOATS. L.W. BONE, USDA, Animal Parasite Research Laboratory, Auburn, AL. Dietary zinc is important during in? fection in both man and ruminants. Few studies have examined zinc status during helminth infection, although human schistosomiasis may reduce serum zinc while zinc supplementation reduced schis? tosomiasis in hamsters. Nematodes con? tain zinc-dependent enzymes and may sequester zinc sulfide within calcium granules, suggesting competition with their host. Doses of the ruminant nematode Trichostrongylus colubriformis caused a dose-dependent reduction (36% maximum) in weight gain of goats on normal feed. Goats given zinc-deficient feed lost body weight, but independently of the level of helminth infection. Serum zinc levels were independent of nematode inocula and were reduced (61%) in animals on zinc-deficient feed. Thus, the nematode infection had little effect on the host's zinc status. As an aside, the zinc content in nematodes declined by 35% in zinc-deficient animals. 95 HEMOGLOBIN-RELATED CHANGES IN TROUT BLDDD FOLLDUIING BLEEDING. Huoo C. Lane. Wake Forest Univ., Uinston-Salem, NC. Participation of maturing red cells in reestablishing normalcy of oxygen delivery before the total red cell count has returned to normal is inferred by a rise in the ATP:Hb ratio, a proportional increase in the least anodic hemoglobins, a shift to the left of the ODC curve and a reduetion in the magnitude of the Bohr effect between pH 7.0 and B.O. in whole blood or of hemoglobin solutions within five days of a 20% bleeding. Red cells were segregated according to age classes by the use of unit gravity cell separation on a 0.5-2.0% BSA gradient. The youngest cells showed a higher than normal ATP:Hb ratio and a higher proportion of the least anodic hemoglobins. Preliminary data are pointing to the young cell having a left shifted ODC curve and a narrower Bohr effect. Thus, whole blood changes do reflect thB unique features of the young red cell in the recovery . 96 EMBRYONIC CEPHAL0-PEDAL PUMPING IN THE TERRESTRIAL SLUG, LIMAX MAXIMUS. I.G. Welsford and P.J. Prior. Dept.Biological Sciences, Northern Arizona Univ., Flag- staff, AZ. 86011-5640 The terrestrial slug, Limax maximus. undergoes direct development during which an anterior cephalic sac and a posterior podocyst are distinguishable within 3-5 days (stage III). These structures reach their greatest size by approximately 15 days of development (stage V) and decline progressively until hatching at 27+2.3 (x? S.D.;n=12) days (stage VI). By 7 days of development (stage IV) these structures begin contracting in antiphase at 0.17 + 0.03 Hz (n=23). The rhythmic contraction of each structure was maintained for over an hour when embryos were transected (n= 20). Dextran injections into both struc? tures and histological sections of whole embryos revealed that the spaces within the cephalic sac and podocyst are not con? tinuous with one another, but are ap? parently parts of separate compartments within the embryo (n=10). Since regular heart activity does not begin until stage V in Limax. this cephalo-pedal pumping could serve to circulate embryonic hemo? lymph prior to the maturation of the cardiovascular system.

R.B. Pitkin, Shippensburg University, PA Isolated hearts were suspended in an organ bath and heart rates recorded with a force transducer. Drugs were added to the bath to create a 10""' to 10~2 M range. At 10~3 acetylcholine (parasympathetic transmitter), no heart activity was recorded. However, propranolol (parasympathetic blocker) did not change the heart rate. Neither of the possible sympathetic trans? mitters, epinephrine nor norepinephrine, significantly (ANOVA, P&gt; 0.05) changed the heart rate although there was a trend toward increasing heart rates with norepinephrine. Propranolol, a $ sympathetic blocker, did not influence heart rate. With a 3 agonist, isoproterenol, there was a trend toward increasing rates but at 10~2, the heart rate declined significantly. Phenylephrine, an a sympathetic agonist showed a significant decrease in rate at 10"* ^ and the hearts did not recover. The parasympathetic transmitter inhibited the heart, but the role of the sympathetic system is still unclear. 98 NEUROMUSCULAR PHYSIOLOGY OF SPONTANEOUSLY BEATING ATRIAL PREPARATIONS FROM EARLY LARVAL AND ADULT BULLFROGS. P. B. Kimmel. Univ. of Massachusetts, Amherst. Preparations consisting of the atria and sinus venosus from early larval and adult Rana catesbeiana were transmurally stimulated _in vitro to characterize the extent of sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation. Stimuli were delivered during the refractory period of sponta? neous contractions. Larval preparations as early as TK Stage III showed evidence of both types of innervation. Transmural stimulation produced a rapid bradycardia and reduction in contractile tension, followed by a gradual increase in rate and force of contractions. Inhibitory effects of stimulation could be blocked with the cholinergic antagonist scopolamine, and excitatory effects could be blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, but not by the alpha-antagonist phentolamine. Responses were similar in preparations from adult bullfrogs. Whether cardiac nerves are functional in intact larvae remains to be determined. 99 ATRIOVENTRICULAR CONDUCTION (AVC) IN THE DOMESTIC FOWL. J.M. Goldberg. P.A. Joo*. and R.A. Manlapaz*. Univ. Calif., Davis. The ability of the AVC system (AVCS) to conduct is dependent upon the recovery interval between successive activations and the eiectrical coupling between cells. The effects of step changes in recovery interval during spontaneous and paced activations on AVC were studied in five anesthetized, male White Leghorn chickens. The AVC increased an average of 41 msec, range 25 - 70 msec, from a spontaneous average of 76 msec, range 65 - 85 msec. The magnitude of this increase is much less than that seen in mammals indicating that AVC in the chicken is less recovery interval dependent. The effect of a step change in recovery interval when the steady state recovery interval was altered by pacing is also different than in mammals. Conduction fatigue at long steady state recovery intervals and facilitation at short recovery intervals were not seen in the chicken. Thus, in the chicken, unlike mammals, there is minimal interac? tion between the steady state and step changes in recovery intervals in deter? mining AVC. Therefore, the functional properties of the AVCS in chicken are qualitatively different from that found in mammals. (Calif.

Field experiments determine the degree to which habitat preference by amphipods reflects food preference. Mesh bags of different plant debris were placed at the pickleweed-cordgrass (Salicornia- Spartina) ecotone. Numbers of amphipod colonists were recorded after periods of one week. Colonization studies were followed by feeding studies conducted in the laboratory. Colonists exhibit a marked habitat preference for live plant material over simulated plant material. Each species of colonist exhibits a unique set of debris preferences. The food resource provided by patches of debris appears to be important in determining the frequency of colonization.</page><page sequence="27">Abstracts 27A 143 HABITAT PREFERENCE IN JUVENILE RED KING CRABS (Paralithodes camtschatica). M.B, Babcock. CC. Brodersen and P.A. Rounds*. NMFS, Auke Bay Laboratory, AK. Young-of-the-year (YOY) and 2-3 yr. red king crabs were tested for preference of 5 different habitats: Sand, shell hash, shale, cobble and bryozoan assemblages. Crabs were presented with a choice of 4 of the 5 habitats and tests were conducted at different densities (D) - YOY, D-l and 4; 2-3 yr., D-4 and 12. Tests lasted 24 h and observations on location and degree of cover were conducted every 3 h after acclimating 1 h. Crabs of both ages and at all densities tested chose bryozoan assemblages (32%- 53%). YOYs at D-4 and 2-3yr. crabs tested at D-12 showed a wider distribution in other habitats than crabs tested at the lower densities. Crabs exhibited diurnal activity; significantly more were exposed during night time observations than during daylight (67% vs. 43%). Our results indicate that habitat providing some degree of cover is preferred by juvenile red king crabs. If habitat with cover is lacking in areas of juvenile settlement, survival and recruitment may be affected.

In the laboratory, primiparous female red king crab, Paralithodes camtschatica, release larvae, molt, and extrude eggs before multiparous crabs. In the field, we observed primiparous females in shal- low water being courted a month before multiparous females. Using ultrasonic telemetry, we tracked 20 crabs weekly to determine if the two groups also exhibit a shift in their migratory behavior. Preliminary results indicate that this behavioral shift occurs. Sixty-three percent of the primiparous females tagged in mid-May had migrated 2 to 3 kilometers to depths greater than 90 meters by late July, while the others occupied depths of 55 meters within 1 kilcmeter of their initiaj. release. In contrast, multi? parous females tagged in early June were still in relatively shallow (x=45 meters) water and only two had moved more than a kilometer from their release point. Water temperatures at depths occupied by multiparous females ranged from 6.1?C to 6.5?C, while primiparous females migrated to depths where water temperatures were between 6.0?C and 6.1?C.

As part of a study of habitat selection by Dungeness crabs I examined fine-scale patterns of movement of Cancer magister in 5 bays in southeastern Alaska. Thirty-six adult C. magister were tracked using ultrasonic biotelemetry for periods of about a week. Positions of the crabs were fixed every 6 hours (at high and low water). Preliminary results indicate that the crabs were active about half the time. The level of activity was independent of sex and reproductive state (ovigerous vs nonovigerous) of the females. Home range size depended on sex; males occupied larger (p&lt;0.001) home ranges than females. Home range and body size (carapace width) were uncorrelated within the sexes. Ovlgerous crabs spent most of their time after release in the habitat in which they were originally captured and visited fewer available habitats than did nonovigerous females and males. Ovigerous C. magister were no less active than males and nonovigerous females, but their movements appeared more restricted. 146 MICROHABITAT SELECTION BY MOLTING BLUE CRABS (CALLINECTES SAPIDUS). M.A. Shirley and T.G. Wolcott. NC State Univ., Raleigh. Premolt ("white sign") blue crabs are fitted with raolt- signalling ultrasonic transmitters, released into Pantego Creek (a tributary of Pamlico Sound, NC) and followed until the transmitter announces that molt has occurred. Physico-chemical characteristics of microhabitats along the track are compared with those of the site selected for ecdysis. Results to date show that within 24h of release, crabs tend to move rapidly, males into shallower (1.5m) water than females (2.5m). After this initial movement, they may move about in a small area for some days. A second long-distance movement may be followed by another period of clustered movements near the eventual molting site. Both sexes avoid low p02, seem to become progressively more selective in microhabitat choice (evidenced by decreasing variances in pH, p02 and temperature), and eventually select similar shallow sites in creek or river for ecdysis.

Univ. of Alabama in Huntsville. A population of Mysidium columbiae inhabiting a mangrove root community bordering the periphery of Twin Cays, Belize was investigated seasonally. Population densities ranged from 69000 in summer to 600 individuals/m in winter. Winter individuals aggregated into small separate swarms, but summer swarms coalesce to form almost continuous shoals along protected shores. Reproduction occurred throughout the year with peak activity coinciding with maximum population size. During high light intensity swarms were compact, highly stratified, and located furthest from shore. At night swarms dispersed. Smallest juveniles formed tight aggregates next to mangrove prop roots. Mature and immature adults separated widely, but remained next to the bottom or against the bank of the cay. As sunlight brightens the water postlarvae and juveniles swarm at the top of shoals while mature and gravid individuals comprise the bottom. This mysid functions as a detritivor. 148 SURVIVAL ADAPTATIONS IN A GREGARIOUS PEDUNCULATE BARNACLE: SETTLEMENT, GROWTH AND JUVENILE MOTILITY. D. L. Hoffman. Bucknell University, Lewisburg, PA. Settlement of Pollicipes polymerus larvae occurs year-round off LaJolla, CA, peaking during the spring months. Cypris larvae settle in aggregative patterns on the proximal end of the peduncles of con? specifics (underneath the capitula) within a zone of new growth (Darwin, 1851; Hoffman, 1984). Mortality is very high among these recent recruits; however survivors grow rapidly, attaining rostro- carinal lengths up to 9mm within two to three months. Typically barnacles less than 10mm R-C length remain attached to the peduncles of those 10mm and greater which are in contact with the primary substratum. Field observations indicate that the attached barnacles produce rhizoid-like peduncular extensions that grow downward eventually reattaching the recruits to the primary substratum. Thus larval settlement on adult peduncles pro? vides a protective program for eventual purchase with the substrate facilitating recruitment into the adult aggregations.

Mar. Sci., NY. G_. mucronatus and ?. palustris were tested with artificial foods made of agarose with (1%) added sugars, malto-oligosaccharides or starch to see if the foods would elicit feeding and whether the animals had preferences. All pair-wise combinations of agarose blank, glucose (Gl), maltose (G2), etc. through G6, and amylopectin were tested, each time with a fresh animal (4-6 replicates). The foods were ranked for preference (Boyd and Silk, 1984, Anim. Behav. 32:374). In both species, the blank was preferred the least (P&lt;.05), and the starch the most (P&lt;.05). In G. mucronatus differences among the other carbohydrates were also significant. The results show that microgram quantities of pure, simple carbohydrates elicit persistent feeding, and that Gammarus can distinguish among sugars and oligosaccharides. 150 INFESTATION OF MANGROVE CRABS, SCYLLA SERRATA (FORSKlL, 1755) BY OCTOLASMIS CYPRID LARVAE. W. B. Jeffries, H. K. Voris* and C. M. Yang*. Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pa., Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, II., and National Univ. of Singapore. Stalked barnacles of the genus Octo- lasmis live symbiotically in the gill chambers of the mangrove crab, Scylla serrata, a favored source of protein for millions of Southeast Asians. The relationship between the barnacles and their hosts was examined through field and laboratory experiments in Singapore using crabs obtained from Indonesia and Sri Lanka. Adult intermolt crabs, pre? molt crabs, recently molted crabs, and molted crabs which had been held in filtered sea water and later exposed in the Straits of Johore 7-14 days, were sacrificed, the barnacles counted and measured. On pre-molt crabs it was established that: large numbers of barn? acles are gravid; cyprids aggregate; under laboratory conditions at ecdysis most (87.7%) cyprids transfer to the newly molted crab, a few (4.1%)-remain on the exuviae, and some (8.2%) are free in the tank. Some cyprid attachment to intermolt crabs occurs.

Crabs were collected under rocks at several shoreline locations from 1973 to 1978. They were examined for external signs of mature isopods such as deformed carapaces or liberation of epicarid larvae, and were then dissected to reveal developmental stages that do not manifest outward signs. There was no apparent difference in the occurrence of isopods in male and female crabs (16.9 % of 930 males vs. 12.0 % of 882 females). Reproducing females of Leidya were found year round, and produced at least two batches of eggs. No crab harbored more than one mature female. Ovigerous crabs (N=153) were never infested with mature parasites, although 11 had invading cryptoniscans or minute early stages. Gonads were undeveloped in female crabs carrying mature female isopods. Relatively subtle asymmetry of the carapace was detected in crabs with mature or nearly mature parasites, and the gills were usually displaced, compressed, distorted or silted. 152 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN THE CORALLIMORPHIAN SEA ANEMONE, awnaens caluv&amp;fica. l. j.

S.A. Stricker and G. Schatten. Univ. of Wisconsin, Madisan. At 13-14? C, oocytes of the starfish Pisaster ochraceus begin to undergo germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) around 50 min after addition of the mataxration-inducing hormone 1- methyladenine. Time-lapse video reoordings of GVBD indicate that bulk cytoplasmic movements cause the GV to lengthen along the A-V axis directly prior to GVBD. Microtubule- disrupting drugs do not affect: i) pre-GVBD changes in nuclear shape; or ii) the time at which GVBD occurs. Treatroents with the inicrofilament-depolymerizing agent cytochalasin B, however: i) essentially eliminate nuclear shape changes prior to GVBD; ii) sli^itly retard the onset of GVBD; and iii) significantly lengthen the time required for a complete mixing of the nucleo- and cytoplasm during GVBD. Oorrelative LM, iiirajnofluorescence, and HVEM studies indicate that breakdown of the nuclear envelope occurs rapidly (in &lt;1 min) at the onset of GVBD and preoedes depolymerization of the nuclear lamina by 10-15 min. Immunofluoresoence analyses also indicate that i) lamins A/C and B stain more intensely directly following breakdown of the nuclear envelope; ii) a phosphorylation of the lamina and meiotic apparatus takes place during GVBD; iii) nuclear matrix antigens that occur at the periphery of the nucleus in most other cells remain associated with the chromosoroes during oocyte maturation; and iv) epitopes that crossreact with antibodies against snRNP's are abundant in the GV.

Univ. of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas. Two molecules of the sea urchin embryonic basal lamina have been characterized by immunological techniques. One of the molecules arrears to be a fibronectin-like molecule and the other molecule recognized by McAb IG9 is of unknown function. By TEM and LM immunolocalization methods, both molecules are shown to reside within the basal lamina of the pluteus larva. In the egg, these components are associated with golgi complexes. Western-blot analysis and immunoprecipitation studies of metabolically labeled proteins demonstrate that the same form of the molecule is recognized through development, but that new synthesis does not occur until the blastula stage. Therefore, the presence of these molecules in the egg and early development appears co be due to synthesis and storage during oogenesis.</page><page sequence="30">30A American Society of Zoologists 155 SPERM CAPACITATION IN THE DECAPOD SICYONIA INGENTIS. A.H. Wikramanayake* K.Shigekawa* and W.H. Clark, Jr. Bodega Marine Laboratory, Univ. Ca., Davis. Sperm removed from male Sicyonia ingentis will not undergo an acrosome reaction (AR) in response to egg derived inducers, while sperm that have been stored in female seminal receptacles do undergo a biphasic AR (acrosomal exocy? tosis and acrosomal filament formation)in the presence of such inducers. This acquisition of competence to undergo the AR after storage by the female sug? gests a "capacitation-like" process. Exam? ination of sperm removed from males and from seminal receptacles of females has revealed striking differences. S.ingentis sperm are non-motile, possess a main body containing an uncondensed nucleus, a cap region containing acrosomal and sub- acrosomal structures, and an anterior spike that is part of the acrosome. The spike of sperm removed from males has a helical appearance. Within the seminal receptacle the spike loses its helical structure and this change seems pre- requisite for acrosomal exocytosis. Sub- acrosoraal changes, required for acrosomal filament formation, also take place during storage in the female.

CM. DAVTTT AND J.H. IARSEN, JR. WASHINGTON STA1E UNIV., PULLMAN. In mature female Rhyacotriton olympicus spermatozoa shed their cytoplasraic droplets during storage in the spermathecal tubules. The spherical to tear-shaped droplet (l-3u in length) prior to its release, is enclosed within the spermatozoan's surrounding unit membrane anywhere along the sperm head to the end of the principal piece. Contact between a detached droplet and the apex of an epithelial cell results in the droplet being phagocytised by the cell. After droplet internalization, membrane fusion occurs between the resulting phagocytic vacuole and cell granules. Occasionally in mature females treated with gonadotropin (HCG), intact spermatozoa are also internalized by cells of the spermathecal epithelium. Droplets and spermatozoa not corapletely degraded by the cell during this process subsequently appear in the intracellular spaces and eventually in the connective tissue at the base of the epithelium. Phagocytosis by spermathecal epithelial cells is apparently an activity that includes a mechanism for identifying detached cytoplasraic droplets and impaired spermatozoa for subsequent removal from the lumen of the tubule. 157 REGULATION OF EARLY SUCCESSION IN A LOW ROCKY INTERTIDAL ALGAL ZONE ON THE OREGON COAST. fi.&amp;. Menae. Oregon State Univ., Corvallis. In a partial factorial field experiment, recruitment density of ConstantAPea siroplex, Hymenena. sp. (wave-beaten sites), Odonthalia floccosa, and NeorhQdomela larjx (sheltered sites) in low intertidal surfgrass (Phyllospadix spp.) beds depended on differences in site, location within site, and species serving as the source of spores, but not on distance or direction from the source, on preemptive competition, or directly on grazing molluscs. Grazers indirectly increased recruitment by reducing the cover of opportunistic algae. Thus, unlike some species, recruitment of these early- and mid-successional algae is evidently not restricted to the immediate vicinity of adults. Colonization seems most dependent on times of disturbance, spore release, and possibly on herbivores. Colonization ability of these algae appears inversely related to competitive ability. 158 COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND DIVERSITY OF CORAL REEFS: THE ROLE OF HISTORY. Terencc P. Hughes. University of California, Santa Barbara, California 93106, U.S.A. Disturbance, predation, competition and disease have been shown to be important processes affecting the structure and dynamics of biological communities. Typically these processes act together, a pattern which has led to much debate concerning their interaction and relative importance. On tropical reefs, disturbance from recurrent hurricanes has obvious and devastating effects, and can contribute to the maintenance of high diversity among competing species by preventing monopolization of space. I show here that competition between corals and algae can also help to maintain coral diversity if common species are reduced disproportionately. This pattern occurred on Jamaican reefs during the course of an algal bloom, but only because a prior rearrangement of coral assemblages by a hurricane resulted in a high relative abundance of poor competitors. As demonstrated by these events, the roles of disturbance and competition in community dynamics depends heavily on their timing and chronology. The interplay between a major disturbance and competitive interactions occured even though the events were unrelated and took place years apart. This result shows that a more complete understanding of community structure often requires knowledge of both present and past dynamics.</page><page sequence="31">Abstracts 31A 159 PHYSICAL DISTURBANCE AND THE STRUCTURE OF TIDEPOOL COMMUNITIES. P.G. van Tamelen. Oregon State Univ., Corvallis The zonation pattern of algae within tidepools was quantified and measurements were made of physical factors which vary in this community. At the pool edges, erect coralline and fleshy algae predominate. Further down the pool sides crustose algae, particularly coralline species, are abundant. At the bottom of these pools very little algae is found. Many physical factors could account for this zonation pattern, but one seems particularly important. Scouring by rocks and other debris is greatest at the pool bottoms and declines in intensity up the sides of the pools. This corresponds to the resistance of different types of algae to being struck by rocks. The most resistant species are found near the pool bottoms where scouring is greatest and the least resistant species are found near the pool edges where scouring is less intense. Preliminary results of experiments manipulating rocks in tidepools indicate that this pattern is due to scouring. 160 INTERANNUAL VARIATION OF THE ALGAL/ INVERTEBRATE TURF COMMUNITY IN A CENTRAL CALIFORNIA GIANT KELP FOREST. R.E. Phillips, J.M. Watanabe and P.C. Barnett*. Monterey Bay Aquarium, Monterey, CA. Percent cover of benthic algae and sessile invertebrates was followed in 1- m permanent quadrats off Hopkins Marine Station, Pacific Grove, CA, between March 1985 and the present. Nutrients, temperature, and surface canopy cover of giant kelp were also monitored. Benthic light levels were estimated from above - water irradiance. Over 70 species occur? red at least once in our permanent quadrats, but most were too rare for detailed analysis. Dominant algal species were Rhodymenia spp, Gigartina corymbifera, and articulated corallines; dominant invertebrates were Balanophyl- lia, encrusting bryozoans, Serpulorbis, Corynactis, and several ascidians. The abundant species followed one of three general patterns: seasonal fluctuation, apparent constancy or long term increase or decline. Physical parameters and surface canopy cover of giant kelp were not correlated with changes in abund? ance, except for Rhodymenia and Fryeella which varied positively with subsurface light and nitrate or negatively with water temperature. 161 SHIFTING ZONES IN A BAY OF FUNDY SOFT-SEDIMENT COMMUNITY. W.H. Wilson. Univ. of Washington, Seattle. A distinct zonation pattern was observed in the spring on a Bay 01 Fundy mudflat with an upper zone dominated by deposit-feeding polychaetes and a lower zone dominated by the amphipod Corophium volutator. Laboratory experiments showed that the reciprocal effects of adult polychaetes and adult Corophium on each other were weak. Adult polychaetes had a strong negative impact on juvenile Corophium. In July, Corophium invaded the upper intertidal zone, becoming the most abundant member of the community. The population dynamics of none of the resident infauna of the upper zone indicated significant declines as Corophium density rose. Growth in Corophium was reduced compared to that of conspecifics in the lower zone. Disturbance by the epibenthic gastropod, Ilyanassa obsoleta, resulted in significant mortality to Corophium but other taxa were not affected. Most taxa declined over the winter when the flat was scoured by ice. The experimental data show that the well- defined zonation observed in the spring was not maintained by competitive interactions. 162 BENTHIC COMMUNITY INTERACTIONS AT THE INTERFACE BETWEEN SAND BOTTOMS AND KELP FORESTS. S. L Kim. Moss Landlng Marine Laboratories, California. The rock-sand ecotone in kelp forests harbors a unique mixture of rocky and sandy bottom species, most obviously the large tube-dwelling polychaete Diopatra ornata. D. ornata size depends on the amount of drift kelp available as a food source, while tube density depends on the degree of exposure to oceanic swell and shifting substrate. Distribution of associated species also varies primarily with the supply of drifting food and intensity of wave exposure, the relative importance of these factors depending on the requirements of the species. Community structure was remarkably stable during one year of sampling. Development of a similar community around artificial reefs depends on placement of the reef, which effects food supply and wave exposure. Fouling organisms on the tube caps of D. ornata do not inhibit feeding or growth of the polychaete. Predatory animals from both adjacent habitats are common and feed in the D. ornata tube mat. The stabilizing influence of tubes in sandy sediment allows a group of organisms to persist in and on the tube mat that are not present in the sandy habitat. Though many rocky and sandy species do not use the ecotone, some rely on the community for food or refuge. Ecotone organisms depend on both bordering communities for food and structure.</page><page sequence="32">32A American Society of Zoologists 163 BIOMASS OF DEEP-SEA BENTHIC CONNUNITIES ALONG THE U.S. ATLANTIC CONTINENTAL SLOPE AND RISE. B. Brown. Battelle Marine Sciences Laboratory, Sequim, WA. Estimates of biomass (? standing stock) of benthic communities in the deep-sea are extremely limited and only wet weight biomass has been measured. No quantitative studies have been completed to measure ash-free dry weight (AFDW) in the deep sea. This study presents quantitative wet weight and AFDW data for benthic communities on the U.S. Atlantic continental slope and rise over a geographic range from Massachusetts to Georgia. Two nested sieves were used to separate organisms from the sediment with 0.3-mm and 2.0- mm mesh openings. Mean total AFDW ranged between 0.166 and 2.144 g/mz. Small numbers of large organisms greatly increased AFDW biomass values in the northern areas. AFDW was usually higher in the 2.0-mm fraction than in the 0.3-mm fraction. Of the taxa studied, annelids were the group contributing the most AFDW biomass in all of the 0.3-mm fractions; while in the 2.0-mm fractions, annelids or echinoderms comprised the most AFDW biomass. 164 MESOPELAGIC-BATHYPELAGIC planktonic FOR AMINIFERA FROM THE NORTH-CENTRAL PACIFIC. Roberta K. Smith and Marcia M. Gowing. Univ. of California, Santa Cruz. Planktonic foraminifera have been thought to live mainly in the euphotic or epipelagic zone. To test whether there is truly an endemic foraminiferal fauna in meso- and bathypelagic waters, we took opening-closing net tows to document the existence of the deep-living population and sediment-trap samples to determine the numbers and species that were sinking. We did this in a 0-2000 m vertical profile (VERTEX Station V5A, north-central Pacific). The com? parison revealed a mesopelagic and bathypelagic fauna liv? ing below ?200 m in addition to well-known faunas charac? teristic of shallower waters. The mesopelagic-bathypelagic fauna consisted of little known and possibly new species. Taxonomic diversity was low though specimen numbers were high. Plankton tows (standing stock) and particle interceptor traps (fluxes) yielded taxonomically very similar large collections. A small-sized (commonly 75-100 |i- diameter) taxon, "Berggrenia rogl", greatly dominated the fauna numerically. Specimens of a few other small-sized taxa also were present They included forms previously recognized by Rcgl and Bolli (1973) from the Carioco Trench and a new species of Tenuitella. The fauna showed no significant taxonomic variability over the roughly 200- 2000 m depth of its capture. This contrasts sharply with faunas of shallower waters which reveal considerable verti? cal stratification and taxonomic or dominance change through the upper 200 m. This probably reflects the mesopelagic-bathypelagic environments being much more uniform throughout than is the epipelagic zone?at least for these organisms with calcium carbonate tests, above the lysocline or calcium-carbonate-compensation depth. 165 A FOSSIL RECORD FOR TREMATODES: ITS EXTENT AND POTENTIAL USES. G.M. Ruiz. Univ. of Washington, Friday Harbor Laboratories. Some parasitic flatworms (Phylum Platyhelminthes, Class Trematoda) leave pits on the interior shell surface of Recent clam hosts. Based on comparisons of pits within fossil and Recent shells of the same genera, a history of association between trematodes and their molluscan hosts is established for over 5 million years. This represents the first report of a fossil record for the Trematoda/ Pits of similar morphology are present on the shells of many other bivalve genera (both fossil and Recent), indicating that a substantial fossil record may exist for parasitic helminths. The potential uses of this fossil record for studies of evolutionary biology, paleoecology, biogeography, and phylogeny are discussed. 166 DAYTIME NET AVOIDANCE BY ATLANTID HETEROPOD MOLLUSCS IN WATERS OFF HAWAII. R. R. Seapy. California State University, Fullerton. Avoidance of capture by 70-cm Bongo nets in the upper 50 m of the water column off the Island of Oahu was tested by taking replicate series of tows with Bongo and 4-m^ nets. Among the eleven species represented in the tows, four were caught in significantly greater numbers by the 4-m^ net. For each of the four species, animals of comparable size were caught by the two types of nets, and the maximal shell length was less than 2 mm. The results indicate that daytime abundances in shallow waters are substantially underestimated when the data are based on samples taken with standard Bongo nets.</page><page sequence="33">Abstracts 33A 167 DRAG OR ACCELERATION REACTION? FORCES ON THE HYDROID OBELIA LONGISSIMA IN OSCILLATING FLOW. T\. Hunter. Univ. California, Berkeley. The peak hydrodynamic force on the flexible hydroid Obelia longissima was measured in uni- directional and oscillating flow regimes. Flow velocity was a stronger determinant of peak force on the colony than acceleration regardless of flow regime, suggesting that drag contributes more than acceleration reaction to the forces experienced by the colony. In uni-directional flow, drag is reduced as colonies are "pushed" over close to the substratum thus reducing exposed colony surface and placing the colony in a region of lower ambient flow velocity. In oscillating flow, the motion of the colony as it is reoriented reduces the flow velocity relative to- and thus the drag on the colony. The force on colonies was higher in oscillating flow than in uni-directional flow at the same peak velocity implying that reorientation is a more effective drag-reduction mechanism in uni-directional than in oscillating flow. 168 FLOW CHARACTERISTICS ABOVE AGGREGATIONS OF PHRAGMATOPQMA CALIFORNICA. F. I. Thomas. Univ. of California, Berkeley. The sabeleriid polychaete Phragmatopoma californica conimonly occurs in dense aggregations. Individuals construct tubes of sand grains, each tube has a raised region ("hood") at its opening that pro- trudes into the water flow above the aggregation. Since P. californica is sessile, it depends on the movement of water to provide food, remove wastes, and disperse gametes and young. The fluid flow above these animals may be affect? ed by the presence of these "hoods" which in turn may influence survival and repro? duction. I used photographic and video techniques to analyze the effect of "hoods" on water flow. "Hoods" only affected flow within 1 centimeter of the aggre? gation surface. When "hoods" were present water was retained within the feeding tentacles. This reduced the rate of trans? port of water away from the animals' surface. Ambient flow direction in the field was found to correlate with the direction of "hoods". 169 EFFECTS OF CURRENT SPEED AND FOOD CONCENTRATION ON THE FEEDING PERFORMANCE OF CRINOIDS. A.B. Leonard. Scripps Inst. of Oceanography, Univ. California, San Diego. Food particle capture rates and filtration efficiencies were measured in a laboratory flow tank for two species of passive suspen? sion feeding crinoids (Oligometra serripinna and Antedon mediterranea). From video recordings, instantaneous capture rates were determined under conditions of controlled flow velocities and particle concentrations. Capture rate as a function of current speed peaked at 6 cm s"1 for Oligometra and at 2.3 cm s"1 for Antedon. independent of food concentration. For Oligometra. current velocity for optimal filtration corresponds to the mean velocity measured in situ. Antedon reached maximal feeding rates at 2000 algal cells ml"1. The results for Antedon yield the first 3-dimensional functional response recorded for a passive suspension feeder. Current speed affects the feeding rate of crinoids by controlling the flux of particles to the filter, determining the filter* s size and shape, and influencing the fluid mechanics of flow through the filter and of the aerosol filtration process. In addition, current speed and particle concentration both stimu? late specific behavioral responses which, in combination with the above effects, shape the overall functional response. 170 MECHANICAL MODELS OF THE OPPOSED-BAND CILIARY FEEDINS APPARATUS OF INVERTEBRATE LARVAE. R.B. Emlet Univ. of California, Berkeley. Many larvae of mollusks and annelids feed with 2 parallel rows (bands) of cilia that beat toward each other and capture unicellular algal food. The upstream (prototrochal) cilia are longer than the downstream (metatrochal) cilia and produce the swimning current. Dynam- ically scaled, mechanical models were con? structed to explore the consequences for feed? ing of changes in ciliary angular velocity, cilium length, and metachronal wavelength. A 50 X increase in angular velocity of cilia (cilium Reynolds # range: 3xl0~4 - 1.5xl0""2), increases the velocity of water passing through the feeding apparatus, but the flow field and the shear of cilia through the water do not change. Changes in speed of cilia thus should not affect the mechanism by which food particles are removed from the water. Consis? tent with measurements from living larvae, the models show that the shear of cilia with re? spect to water increases distally along the cilia. Doubllng the length of downstream cilia (from 20 to 40 % of the length of the upstream cilia) moves surrounding water back upstream, increasing the movement of upstream cilia with respect to water. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that downstream cilia enhance particle capture by increasing the likelihood of direct contact between up? stream cilia and passing particles.</page><page sequence="34">34A American Society of Zoologists 171 BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES OF SUSPENSION FEEDING LARVAL BLACK FLIES TO FLOW ALTERATIONS. R.A. Merz. D.D. Hart*. S.J. Genovese*. R. Hansen*. and B.P. Clark. Swarthmore College, PA and Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia, PA Black fly larvae are stream-dwelling suspension feeders that typically have patchy distributions. Because of their potential for rapidly changing position (unlike many sessile suspension feeders) we hypothesized that the observed distributions result because larvae continously assess and select amongst local flow patterns. To test this idea, we conducted a laboratory experiment to determine how movements of larvae varied between spatially uniform and complex flow regimes. Simulium vitatum larvae were added to two replicate channels of a recirculating stream. Flow in one channel was spatially uniform throughout the experiment, whereas flow in the second channel was changed from uniform to complex by the insertion of cylindrical flow obstructions midway through the two day experiment. The average rate of larval movement during the first hour following the addition of flow obstructions was more than 4-fold greater than in control conditions, with larvae tending to move from slow to fast flow sites. Once the larval distribution pattern had stablized following the flow manipulation, there was a strong positive correlation between larval density and current speed at the approximate height of the feeding structure (~2mm). These data demonstrate that larvae can rapidly alter their positions in response to changes in the local flow regime and that the patchy distributions of larval black flies may be a reflection of small scale variations in flow microhabitat. 172 ECOLOGY AND BIOMECHANICAL CONSEQUENCES OF LIVING TOGETHER: INDUCED MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGE IN A NOSTOC- CRICOTOPUS SYMBIOSIS. S. Kleinhaus and A. D. Kaiser*. Univ. of California at Davis. In mountain streams, larvae of two midge species, Cricotopus nostocicola and C. fuscatus develop symbiotically within colonies of the blue-green alga Nostoc parmelioides. Two different types of morphological changes in N. parmelioides result from invasion and occupation by midge larvae and the shape the colony acquires has important consequences with respect to stream flow. By manipulating the macro-flow regimes in situ, we investigate the effects of flow on growth and survival of different forms of NL. parmelioides colonies. Using models in the wind tumel, we determine the significance of drag on different shapes. Flow patterns are photographed and quantified by placing the colonies in a hydraulic flume. When alone on a rock, vertical, disk-shaped colonies show greater success at low to intermediate flows, while flat colonies succeed at high flows. However, the existence of neighboring colonies can neutralize the importance of loss due to drag by expanding the boundary layer, allowing certain aggregations of vertical colonies to persist also at high flows. The interpretation of flow environment may therefore be somewhat complex with regard to the ecology of this system. 173 MEASURING SHEAR STRESS DURING EROSION OF MICROBIAL MATS. A.M. Moore. Duke University, Durham, N.C. Intertidal microbial mats on Shackleford Banks, N. C. are made by filamentous cyanobacteria that intertwine through sand to form a cohesive leathery material. Nearby sediment erodes before the mats. Erosion is due to the shear stress exerted by the flow of the overlying sea water. Clearly, microbial mats will not remain on a beach where shear stresses are high enough to erode them. I have devised a method for measuring the minimum shear stress needed to erode flat microbial mats. An intact mat is placed in a flume so that the mat forms the floor of a rectangular pipe. Flow through the pipe approximates laminar flow between two parallel plates. Shear stress is constant along each plate and, therefore, along the mat which forms one of the plates. Shear stress is calculated from the fluid velocity in the pipe. This apparatus can be used for any sediment provided it is flat and its erosional shear stress is under 5 N/m . Higher shear stresses may be obtained by decreasing the width of the pipe, corresponding to the distance between the parallel plates 174 ROLE OF EXTRACAPSULAR JELLY IN EGGSHELL FORMATION OF THE FLORIDA APPLE SNAIL. CM. Norlund* and R.L. Turner. Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne. The aquatic Florida apple snail iays terrestrial eggs on emergent vegetation. Fresh clutches of 3-60 eggs change color as the extracapsular jelly dries and the eggshells calcify. The role of jelly in eggshell formation was examined by analy? sis of calcium (Ca) distribution in new? ly oviposited clutches using atomic ab? sorption spectroscopy and electron micro- probe analysis and by ultrastructural ex? amination of shell layers using SEM. Egg? shell had a high percentage of Ca by dry weight (37 _+ 1.8%; n ? 4 clutches), and jelly had little Ca (9 + 2.1%). By dry weight alone, computation of Ca content gave the following (mg/egg): shell, 1.0 + 0.29; jelly, 0.027 + 0.0076. Viewed by SEM, the eggshell consists of 3 layers: an inner solid layer of large crystals, a middle layer of thin fibrous laminae, and an outer layer of minute spherules covered by a veneer of amorphous dried jelly. Electron microprobe analysis shows that the inner and middle layers contain equal amounts of Ca. The jelly contains insufficient Ca to contribute substan- tially to calcification of the eggshell.

D.C. Hansen* and J.H. Waite. Coll. of Marine Studies, Univ. of Del., Lewes, DE. Geukensia demissa (Dillwyn) is an estuarine bivalve mollusk that attaches to the rhizomes of Spartina spp. and other solid substrata via a proteinaceous byssus complex similar to that of Mvtilus edulis (L). The byssus contains a polyphenolic protein with L,3,4- Dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) in its primary sequence. Another protein contained in the byssus is the enzyme catechol oxidase (catechol: 02 oxidoreductase). The natural substrate for this enzyme is protein-bound dopa, which is thought to be transformed via quinone tanning and hence allow intermolecular cross-linking to ensue, resulting in a strengthening of the thread. This study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between the age of the thread, its relative content of dopa and tyrosine residues, and the tensile strength of the thread. Threads were sampled from mussels over a five week period. It was determined that wet thread tensile stress increased 358% from 1 hour up to 48 hours and then decreased 307% over the remaining sampling period. Dry thread tensile stress increased 195% from 1 hour up to 96 hours and then decreased 143% over the same time period. There was a 250% decrease in the dopa concentration from 1 hour to 5 weeks for the wet threads and a 168% decrease over the same time period for the dry threads; there was no significant increase or decrease of tyrosine residues. The decrease in strength may be due to the embrittlement of the threads by excessive cross-linking. The results reported here seem to support the theory that enzymatic oxidation of the dopa protein to a cross-linking quinoidal protein accompanies changes in the mechanical properties of the threads.(This work was supported by NSF Grant:3-l-21-3501-98 to JHW) 176 ARTHROPOD SILKS: ARE THEY CUTICLE PROTEINS? J.M. Palmer. Museum of Com? parative Zoology, Harvard University. A wide variety of silk producing morphologies accompany the diversity in function, structure and chemistry of arthropod silks. An indepth survey of studies in silk production provides a comparative perspective which suggests no common origin for all silks and reveals strong evidence of evolutionary convergence in silk functions. Consequently, silks can be categorized and defined with only marginal satisfaction. The idea relating silk proteins to those found in arthropod cuticle is not an original one. Indications scattered throughout the literature from studies on chitinous silks, crystalographic data on cutical associated proteins, the designation of tanned silks as true scletotins, as well as evidence from investigations of the actual process of secretion and spinning make for an attractive hypothesis. Possibilities for molecular and mophological tests using spiders as a model system will be presented. 177 MITOCHONDRIAL GENES AMPLIFIED VIA THE POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION: INFERENCES FOR THE EVOLUTION OF CICHLID FISHES FROM MITOCHONDRIAL GENE SEQUENCES. A. Mever. T.D. Kocher and A.C. Wilson. Univ. of California, Berkeley. A fast method for sequencing of DNA was developed and applied to mitochondrial genes of cichlids. Parts of the 12 s rRNA and the cytochrome b gene were amplified via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The amplification products were sequenced directly by the dideoxy technique. A total of 20 taxa from Africa and the Neotropics were examined and their phylogenetic relationships determined. The rate of sequence divergence is about twice as fast in the cytochrome b as in the 12sRNA gene. The data suggest that some African taxa are closer phylogenetically to Neotropical cichlids than to some other African taxa. Sequencing via the polymerase chain reaction in combination with direct sequencing is superior to traditional restriction fragment analysis. 178 BIOCHEMICAL AND EGG SIZE EVOLUTION OF FRESHWATER FISHES IN THE RHINOGOBIUS BRUNNEUS COMPLEX IN OKINAWA. M. Katoh and M. Nishida. Univ. of the Ryukyus, Okinawa. Rhinogobius brunneus is a common freshwater gobiid species in Japan. Four discrete color types (SC, cross-band; SD, dark; SM, mosaic; LB, blue-ventral) of the goby inhabit the Genka River, Okinawa, Japan; whether these types represent separate species has been a matter of controversy. SC, SD, and SM are amphidromous and have small eggs; LB is landlocked and has large eggs. To examine if each type is a discrete species, about 100 gobies per color type were analyzed by electrophoresis and the females were also used for comparison of clutch size and egg diameter. Electrophoretic data at 34 loci showed that each pair of color types was separated by a fixed-allele difference for at least one locus. However, Nei's genetic distance between SM and LB, which have different life histories, was much smaller (0.026) than distances among amphidromous gobies (0.323-0.480). Moreover, egg diameter and clutch size were significantly different among the four types. These results imply that speciation between SM and LB accompanied the egg diameter increase and isolation has been completed without considerable genetic differntiation.</page><page sequence="36">36A American Society of Zoologists 179 A PHYLOGENETIC AND DISTRIBUTIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE EASTERN PACIFIC MYXODIN CLINIDAE (KELPFISHES). C.A. Stepien and R.H. Rosenblatt. Scripps Inst. of Oceanography, Univ. of Calif., San Diego. The eastern Pacific myxodin Clinidae include the South American genus Myxodes and the North American genera Heterostichus and Gibbonsia. Their systematic relationships were last examined by C. Hubbs (1952), who divided the genus Gibbonsia into 5 species and 10 subspecies. In the present study, allozyme migration data from 40 presumptive gene loci from all 6 species and 12 subspecies of north American clinids were analyzed using 2 methods: Swofford and Berlocher's (1988) FREQPARS program and UPGMA. Myxodes was identified as the sister group to the northern genera and 4 species of labrisomids and 1 species from the Australian clinid tribe Clinini were analyzed as outgroups. Both allozyme and morphological characters demon- strate that Gibbonsia erythra and CL norae should be synonymized with CL montereyensis. (L erythra is shown to be a deepwater eco- phenotype of G. montereyensis and G. norae is a semi-isolated population. There is little support for recognition of subspecies since allozyme data show that there is considerable gene flow between populations. 180 QUALITATIVE CHARACTERS, COLORADO RIVER CHUBS OF THE GENUS GILA, AND "THE ART OF SEEING WELL." M.E. Douglas, W.L. Minckley and H.M. Tyus. Arizona State University and U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service. Qualitative measurements and counts were collected from chubs (genus Gi1a) in the Yampa River (UT) by technicians with no specialized training in systematics. These data were then compared with qualitative rankings of selected morpholgical features scored on the same fish. A high degree of morphological variability was found in the quantitative data when these data were subjected to sheared PCA. This variability confounded species-identification. However, PCAs of qualitative data clearly separated 32 5jl cypha (the endangered humpback chub) from 336 G. robusta (the roundtail chub). Scoring of complex characters like nuchal hump, for instance, is useful when working with endangered species which must be minimally handled to insure uninjured release. 181 THE STATISTICAL INDEPENDENCE OF EXTERNAL MORPHOMETRIC AND OSTEOLOGICAL CHARACTERS IN THE TIGER SALAMANDER, AMBYSTOMA TIGRINUM. H.B. Shaffcr and R.N. Fisher*. University of California, Davis and U.C. Irvine. One widely used strategy for corroborating phylogenetic hypotheses consists of using different, presumably independent data sets on the same group of organisms. However, the statistical independence of such data sets are rarely quantified. Here, we present the phenotypic correlations of 8 external and 17 osteological morphometric characters measured on a sample of 322 individual larval tiger salamanders. Our results indicate that size-independent residuals are much more highly correlated among external morphometric (mean correlation = .33) than among osteological (mean ? .14) variables, and are very low between external and osteological characters (mean ? .10). In addition, certain sets of skull and head measurements are highly correlated, suggesting that they do not contribute independent phylogenetic information. 182 DETECTION OF A SIBLING SPECIES OF TYPHLOPS (SERPETCE3: TYPHLOPIDAE). RICHARD THOMAS and S. BLAIR H3DGE3. Univ. of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras, and Univ. of Maryland, College Park. Typhlops richardi on Puerto Rico is found to comprise two species. Because of the small body-size range of a large sample from the Univ. of Puerto Rico campus, we compared this pop? ulation electrophoretically with two from more interior localities and found puta? tive species-level differences. Further analysis of more samples indicates that the small, undescribed species occurs on the coastal periphery of northern, east? ern, and southeastern Puerto Rico. The large species, Typhlops platycephalus, occurs over much of the rest of the island; syntopy is known at one locality. The western Virgin Islands snakes, Typhlops richardi, are also electropho? retically distinct; the eastern Virgin Islands populations probably comprise another species. Subtle morphological features differentiate the species.</page><page sequence="37">Abstracts 37 A 183 HIGHER CLASSIFICATION OF SNAKES. A.G. Kluge. Museum of Zoology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Recent attempts to classify the more inclusive groups of snakes (e.g., those by Cadle, Dessauer et al., Dowling, Groombridge, McDowell, Rage, Rieppel, and Underwood) have not been widely accepted. There is disagreement concerning the kinds of organisms (living vs. fossil) and data (e.g., biochemical vs. morphological; distance vs. character), the systematic methodology (phenetic vs. cladistic), and the form of the taxonomy (monophyletic vs. paraphyletic) to be employed in such an endeavor. I argue for a single, coherent approach to classification, and the use of all available evidence. Preliminary cladistic analysis of a large data set obtained from extinct and extant taxa and a variety of morphological systems provides modest resolution and corroboration of the major clades. A corresponding monophyletic taxonomy is provided. Further resolution is expected as the data base is expanded to include all available character evidence. 184 PHYLOGENETIC HYPOTHESES AS INDICATORS OF FUNCTIONAL OR STRUCTURAL COMPLEXES. L.S. Ford. The University of Kansas, Lawrence. Complex characters are functional or structural units that are affected by changes in and among individual elements. In systematic analyses, they usually are treated either as a single character re- flecting one interdependent event or a weighted character reflecting the com? plexity of the integration. Both of these treatments assume a priori that the integration of the individual elements was the result of one historical event. Historical interdependence/independence can be verified by the occurrence of the character states of the individual ele? ments as inferred from a phylogenetic hypothesis. The individual elements of a complex functional character, the anuran pectoral girdle, were coded a priori as independent characters in a phylogenetic analysis of advanced frogs. The inter- relationship of characters was verified at two levels: (1) congruence among the individual elements of the pectoral girdle; and (2) congruence between these elements and non-girdle characters. This analysis empirically supports that indi? vidual elements can be tested for their historical interdependence as part of a complex character. 185 CRANIAL DESICN, MECHANICS AND LOOOMJICR BEHAVICR IN THE HOMINIDAE. Dennis M. Eramble. Univ. of Utah, Salt Lake City. Tne geometry and mass distribution of the hominoid cranicmandibular conplex has been assessed with re? spect to head stabilization under both static and dynamic loading conditions. New analytic proce? dures, involving location of the center of gravity (CG) relative to a normal ized Frankfurt Horizontal Axis (FHA), allow close estimates of CG position in antrropoid primates, including extinct hominid taxa for which adequate cranial reconstructions exist. When applied to a conservative hominid transforma? tion series (Aust. afarensis ?+? A. afrioanus + Hcmo habilis ?* H. erectus ?? H. sapiens) the following results are obtained. 1) Relative CG position forms an excellent but nonlinear oontinuum frcm A. afaren? sis to H. sapiens. 2) A. afarensis has the least potential for head stability in both static and dy? namic loading situations. H. erectus is best under dynamic loading while modern H. sapiens is superior in static loading. 3) CG, in all undoubted Hcmo crania, lies well above FHA. On this criterion (and others) some notable "H." habilis specimens (ER 1470) may not quality as Hcmo while others (ER 1813) unquestionably do. In hominids cranial specializa- tions associated with improved head stability (ex- tensive facial reduetion; oocipital protrusion) under dynamic loading are oonf ined to the genus Hcmo. Their evolutionary appearance seems to be correlated with the development of postcranial specializations indicative of sustained running ability (e.g., leg elongation; enhancement of pelvic and lunbosacral shock-absorbing mechanisms). 186 FOSSORIALITY AND SKULL FORM IN ANOMOCHILUS AND OTHER PRIMITIVE SNAKES. D. Cundall and D. A, Rossman*. Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA and Louisiana State Univ., Baton Rouge. Primitive snakes have been regarded as a group of distantly related taxa whose similarities in skull form reflect a shared fossorial mode of life, This assumption was reexamined in light of the previously undescribed skull of Anomochilus, which bears superficial similarities to scolecophidians and uropeltids. Detailed comparisons of the snout, braincase and jaws of Anomochilus and representatives of seven primitive snake families indicate either that these taxa burrow differently or that supposed mechanical constraints imposed by burrowing have less influence on skull form than previously thought. The snout, which presumably incurs the greatest stresses during burrowing, varies greatly among these snakes in the extent and nature of buttressing. Patterns of hyperossification and fusion, reduetion, and loss of bones suggest that skull form in these snakes may be as reflective of phylogeny or of functional constraints associated with feeding as of mechanical constraints related to burrowing.</page><page sequence="38">38A American Society of Zoologists 187 ALTERNATIVE DESIGNS OF AND POTENTIAL CONSTRAINTS ON THE MORPHOLOGY OF DIGIT I IN GECKOS. A.P. Russell and A.M. Bauer. Univ. of Calgary, Canada and Villanova Univ., PA. The sprawling mode of locomotion of lizards is associated with three- dimensional limb kinematics and pedal asymmetry. This asymmetry is associated with the primitive phalangeal formula of 2-3-4-5-3/2-3-4-5-4. With the independ? ent acquisition of subdigital pads in several lineages of gekkonine geckos, there is apparently some limitation to their incorporation into digit I. Due to the presence of only two phalanges in the first digit the mechanisms associ? ated with hyperextension and the effective deployment of subdigital setae have not been able to be incorporated into the pollex and hullux in the same way that they have in other digits. Accordingly, there is great variation in the structure of digit I of pad- bearing gekkonines. In some lineages it has become reduced and effectively abandoned, while in others modifications of the phalanges have occurred that permit the incorporation of a functional pad. The perceived design constraints have apparently been influential in a wide array of genera and lineages. 188 FLYING PERFORMANCE OF FROGS. S.B. Emerson and M.A.R. Koehl, Univ. Utah, Salt Lake City, and Univ. California, Berkeley. Despite the recent interest in the evolution of morphological novelties few studies have examined the actual perfor? mance consequences of shifts in morpho? logical organization. Therefore a com? bined field and lab study was undertaken to measure the relationship between morphology and gliding and parachuting performance in individuals of flying and nonflying species of frogs. Field studies show that all species can delay their time of descent, there is varia? tion in descent time with body shape and limb position, flying frogs are capable of parachuting and gliding, and flying frogs can control the direction of the flight path. Models of frogs were made on which specific morphological or pos- tural features could be varied in a con? trolled way. Measurement of lift and drag on such models in a wind tunnel con- firmed that there are significant differ? ences between flying and nonflying frogs and between large and small flyers. Assessment of aerodynamic stability of models in free-fall suggested that fly? ing frogs are more maneuverable than nonflyers. 189 RUNNING QUAIL DONT BOUNCE: A TEST OF THE MASS-SPRING MODEL OF MOTOR CONTROL. &amp;&amp; Clark. Swarthmore College, PA Recent descriptions of the mechanics of the support phase of running vertebrates use the analogy of a mass-spring system, In which the mass of the body bounces against the ground on a spring-like limb. The spring may consist of muscles, tendons, and possibly reflexes. If the mechanisms of motor control relied on passive, spring-like behavior of the limb, then variable substrate mechanics could drastically alter the pattern of support of the body. I evaluated this model in animals running over mechanically heterogeneous substrates. To test for spring-like control of the limb, I used force- plate and photographic data in a dynamic analysis of the hind limb of bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) running over substrates with stiff (7.3 kN/m) and compliant (185 N/M) patches. The mass-spring model predicts that the stiff ness of the limb and its joints would be constant across different substrates. This was not the case; for steps onto the compliant patches, the quail showed relatively greater stiffnesses of the whole limb and ankle joint than for steps onto the stiff patches. To test for reflex involvement in the observed mechanical changes in the limb, electromyograms (EMG) were recorded in both heads of the gastrocnemius. EMG activity increased gradually prior to and through footfall, then declined for the remainder of the stance. The EMG pattern did not vary across substrates at latencies comparable to the observed mechanical variations. Thus, control of the limb in running quail is not spring- like, and the response to substrate mechanics is not mediated by short-latency changes in motor unit recruitment in the gastrocnemius. 190 HYDRODYNAMICS OF THE FEET OF FISH- CATCHING BATS. F.E. Fish, B.R. Blood, and B.D. Clark. West Chester Univ., West Chester, PA., Univ. of Southem Calif., Downey, CA., and Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, PA. Noctilio leporinus and Pizonyx vivesi represent convergent species of bats that rake the water surface with modified hind feet to catch fish. Hind foot drag for fishing and related non-fishing bats was determined from isolated feet suspended in a water tunnel over a range of water speeds. Drag force increases curvi- linearly with increasing water speed. The highest values of drag were measured in the fishing bats which have larger hind feet compared to related non-fishing bats. However, at high Reynold's Numbers drag coefficients for fishing bats are equivalent or lower than values for non-fishing bats. The laterally compressed digits of fishing bats have values of Fineness Ratio that promote drag reduetion. The modified hind feet of Noctilio leporinus and Pizonyx vivesi indicate a morphological design for hydrodynamic drag reduetion associated with their unique fish catching habits.</page><page sequence="39">Abstracts 39A 191 CARPAL BONE MORPHOLOGY IN TERRESTRIAL AND BURROWING SHREWS. D. L. Swiderski. Michigan State University, East Lansing. Mammals that dig with the forelimbs are expected to have reduced wrist mobility when compared to closely related non- diggers. This difference in mobility should be reflected in the number of carpal bones, the arrangement of the carpal bones, the arrangement of the ligaments, and the shapes of the joint surfaces. Dissections of the terrestrial shrew Sorex cinereus, and the burrowing shrew Blarina brevicauda did not reveal the expected differences. Instead, the structure of both wrists severely limits mobility, which was predicted for Blarina brevicauda, alone. Examination of terrestrial species representing other lineages within the Soricidae revealed that the "burrowing" morphology is widely distributed, despite the fact that most shrews are not burrowers. This study suggests that the morphological conservatism of shrews has not limited their ecological diversity; rather, morphological traits and ecological characteristics have evolved independent ly. 192 OF CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL: EVIDENCE OF DIFFERENTIAL SCALING IN SMALL AND LARGE TERRESTRIAL MAMMALS. J.E.A. Bertram. Univ. of Chicago, Chicago, IL. The scaling of some aspects of limb bone morphology is different for large and small terrestrial quadrupedal mammals. This study includes an original analysis of curvature in the radius of 42 species of terrestrial mammals (assorted taxa covering a mass range of nearly xlO6) and a comprehensive analysis ofthe long bone proportions of the terrestrial Carnivora (118 spp. representing seven families). These data are combined with a re-analysis of long bone proportions for the Bovidae and Ceratomorpha (taken from the available literature). These analyses point to a disconrinuity in scaling of the skeleton that is consistendy indicated at a body mass of about 20 kg. This result suggests a profound (though sometimes graphically subtle) change in the primary physical constraint on the skeletons of these two size groups. The limb elements of large body-size species have proportions that make it appear that their form is restricted primarily by the magnitude of stress produced during locomotion. The differential scaling of limb bone dimensions in animals below this body size implies a different primary constraint on their support skeleton, indicating that small and large terrestrial mammals must contend with mechanically different physical environments. 193 WOLFF'S LAW AND LONG BONE CROSS* SECTIONAL MORPHOLOGY* R.J. Muccl. Univ, of Illinois at Chicago. If bone were a "perfect" tissue and responded uniformly to mechanical loading, then one would expect that the AP surfaces of long bones, loaded by the bending forces of locomotion, would become much thicker than the ML surfaces which contain the neutral plane of bending. But turkeys that hop more on one leg thicken that tibiotarsal cortex on all surfaces, corresponding to what is commonly observed. To further investigate this response, 3-element rosette strain gauges were attached to both the posterior and medial surfaces of these bones in vivo. During locomotion the strain readings at these locations were both different and complex; hence at least two interpretations of the data are possible: 1) the response is non-uniform around the cross section, with the ML surfaces being more sensitive (just as facial bones are in equilibrium with their mechanical load environment at much lower strains than limb bones) or 2) the system responds uniformly to only one (or more) aspects of the total strain history, such as shear, peak axial strain, etc. Either response would allow cross sections to maintain consistent overall shapes while remodeling. 194 PENDULAR MECHANICS, LIMB PROPORTIONS, AND BODY SIZE CONSTRAINTS IN BRACHIATING PRIMATES. S.M. Swartz. North western Univ., Chicago. The kinematics of brachiating animals, particularly gibbons (Hylobates), visually resembles the motions of an ideal pendulum, hence brachiation has been analogized to pendular motion, and has been assumed to confer unique energetic savings on brachiators. Hylobatid skeletal specializations, especially forelimb elongations, have therefore been interpreted as adaptations whose function is to maximize pendular energetic savings. Recent models have also hypothesized that maximum body size for brachiating primates is constrained by the mechanics of a pendular system. This study examines the kinematics of gibbon brachiation in comparison to pendular motion, considers the effects of body weight distribution on the energetics of arm- swinging, and evaluates the claim that pendular motion dictates an upper limit on body size for brachiators. The analysis of swing period, excursion angle, and velocity of brachiating gibbons demonstrates that contrary to accepted models, the correspondence between pure pendular motion and the kinematics of brachiation is imprccise. Allometric analysis of the limb skeleton shows that forelimb bones in anthropoid primates scale close to isometrically, and that brachiators do not deviate from this pattern, although their forelimbs are tremendously elongated As a consequence, body mass is distributed differentially to the limbs in brachiators, requiring greater energetic output to accelerate and decelerate the extremely massive limbs. Analysis of the muscular force required to maintain handhold integrity at peak centripetal force contradicts the claim that body size for brachiators is constrained to a maximum of 10-30 kg for biomechanical reasons.</page><page sequence="40">40A American Society of Zoologists 195 ANATOMY OF MOTOR NEURONS GENERATING FEEDING MOVEMENTS IN LIMULUS POLYPHEMUS. H. M. Lee Univ. of Massachusetts, Amherst. Feeding behavior in the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus is generated by central pattern generators (CPG). The patterns of motor output in the entocoxal nerves innervating the feeding musculature have been characterized. I have shown that the monoamine octopamine modulates these feeding CPGs. The present study describes the anatomical localization of the motor neurons involved in the chewing motor pattern. The prosomal CNS of Limulus was dissected out and the entocoxal nerves which contain the motor axons were retrogradely backfilled with cobalt chloride. After a 44-48 hour incubation, the tissues were rinsed, developed with ammonium sulfide, fixed, dehydrated and cleared in methyl salicylate. There are two discrete clusters, each with approximately one dozen somata for the motor neurons of each entocoxal nerve. The somata are 10- 30 um in size and occupy lateral positions between adjacent pedal ganglia.

G.Escalona de Motta, L.Cordova and L.Diaz-Miranda (intro. by E. Ortiz). Univ. of Puerto Rico, Medical Sci? ences and Rio Piedras Carapuses, San Juan. Longitudinal muscles of this sessile polychaete responded with complex relaxa- tion/contraction cycles to various pharma- cological agents. Acetylcholine elicited only slow contractions while serotonin re- laxed the basal tension. Neither were blocked by known antagonists. Nicotine produced multiphasic responses consisting of a relaxation followed by a contracture generally preceded by a fast contraction peak. N-methylpyrrolidine, a component of this molecule, exerted similar actions at lower concentrations. without the methyl group, pyrrolidine was active at nanomolar concentrations. The relaxation and fast con? tractions peaks, but not the contractures, were inhibited by nicotinic antagonists. Muscarinic antagonists had no effect. Re? sults suggest the presence of novel pyrro- lidinic receptor sites in these muscles. Amino acids and peptides containing termi? nal pyro-glu groups could be endogenous agonists for these sites.

Greenherq The Whitney Laboratory, Univ. Florida, St. Augustine Peptides related to the molluscan tetrapeptide, Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2 (FMRFamide) have been iso? lated from, and identified in, several different animal phyla, including the Arthropoda. Since the phylum Annelida is thought to have evolved from ancestors common to molluscs and arthropods, we decided to search in Nftrpis vlrans for FMRFamide-related pep? tides (FaRPs). The peptide was extracted from worm heads Into cold acetone and was purified by HPLC. Two different solvent systems were used alternately until purity was reached, the peptide peak being monitored with an RIA for FMRFamide. The pure pep? tide was sequenced and Identified as FMRFamide; each head contained approximately 200 fmoles. FaRPs are now likely to occur In all protostomes, and FMRFamide itself probably occurs in all annelids. The distribution of this tetrapeptide ls therefore polyphyletic, and it may yet be found In more primitive phyla.

Northern Arizona Univ., Flagstaff, AZ 86011-5640. LiTOflx maximus exhibits water orienta? tion behavior when dehydrated to 70% of its initial body weight (%IBW). Injec? tion of mannitol into hydrated animals, to increase hemolymph osmolality to 180-200 mOsm/kgHaO while leaving the ionic concen? tration unaltered, does not elicit water orientation behavior (n=28). When dehy? drated slugs received saline injections that increased hemolymph volume, but not the concentration, they displayed water orientation as seen in 70% IBW slugs. Thus, the reduetion in hemolymph volume that accompanies dehydration is alone insufficient to initiate water orientation In addition, neither increased hemolymph Na* or K- elicited water orientation (n=18). These data suggest that changes in hemolymph volume, osmolality, Na* or K* concentrations individually are not suffi? cient to elicit water orientation behavior in Limax. Earlier work shows that the pep? tide AVT is capable of modifying water regulatory behaviors in Limax. We are currently testing a combination of stimuli that may initiate the release of an AVT- like peptide.

Stanford Univ., CA. HiDernation involves a marked inhiDition of motor output which could result from: 1) Q-^q effects , or, 2) central inhibition or the motor neurons. We recorded from single neurons within the reticular formation of Spermophilus lateralis, a region involved in control of motor output. We also monitored TD, EEG and EMG. Thus, we determined state selectivity and firing rates of cells while animals were euthermic, and then observed alterations as TL changed during oouts of hibernation. 13 cells were recorded in 4 euthermic animals, and 6 cells were followed during hibernation. State selectivity was generally maintained as Tb fell, but, changes in firing rates did not show a simple Q-^q. 2 cells recorded m the pontine atonia region showed increased firing rates as TD decreased. 2 units recorded in brainstem regions thought to facilitate shivering showed decreased firing rates, beyond that predicted by the decline m TQ. These results suggest that there is centrally mediated inhibition of motor output during hibernation.

Wake Forest Univ. ,Winston-Salem, N.C. and Univ. of Colorado Medical Center, Denver. Nasal trigeminal receptors are part of the common chemical sense which functions to detect irritating compounds. Capsaicin, which desensitizes animals to chemogenic pain, presumably by affecting un- myelinated fibers containing substance P, was injected (50 mg/kg) into 2 day old rat pups to examine this system further. Rats were tested after 40 days of age. Chemical stimuli failed to elicit or elicited markedly reduced neural responses (as compared with controls) from the ethmoid branch of the trigeminal nerve in capsaicin-treated rats. Responses to tactile stimulation were not affected. After fixation, the nasal epithelia of capsaicin-treated and control rats were reacted immunocytochemically for substance P (SP) and calcitonin-gene-related- peptide (CGRP). In controls, intraepithelial fibers immunoreactive for both SP and CGRP were seen, a few of which reached the surface of the epithelium. Immunoreactive fibers also were seen in olfactory nerve fasicles beneath the epithelium. In capsaicin-treated rats, no intraepithelial immunoreactive fibers were seen, while immunoreactive fibers in olfactory nerve fasicles were sparse. These results suggest that trigeminal nerve fibers in the nasal cavity which respond to irritants may be polymodal nociceptors containing SP.

Flight behavior was observed in a laboratory culture of tobacco hawkmoths hovering at artificial flowers to feed. Feeding bouts averaged 32 s, and 15% lasted longer than 60 s. Animals that do not learn to feed on the flowers die within a week but others can live more than 3 weeks. Simultan- eous video films of the top and side views during feeding were used for kinematic analysis. Estimates of the mechanical power output for hovering ranged between 82 and 181 W/kg of muscle or between 357 and 787 W/kg of body mass. These values are in good agreement with the measured values of mechanical power output from Manduca flight muscle. 202 THE LENGTH-TENSION RELATIONS IN A LOCUST FLIGHT MUSCLE. J.G. Malamud. Univ. of California, Irvine. Insect flight muscle is often described as being an unusually stiff striated muscle. Muscle stiffness and some other mechanical properties of the tergocoxal muscle (a wing muscle) of the locust Schistocerca americana were inves? tigated. There was little tension (about 1 N/cm2) in the unstimulated muscle at the in vivo length and only about 2 N/cm2 at 10% strain. Active tetanic tension was maximum (about 32 N/cm2) at slightly less than the in vivo length, and was 50% or more of its maximal value over a range of 80% to 130% of the in vivo length. Twitch tension was maximum at slightly greater than the in vivo length. The twitch relaxation time increased with muscle length, while time to peak tension was nearly independent of muscle length in a stretched muscle. The length-tension properties of this locust flight muscle, both when stimulated and at rest, were not greatly different from those of frequently studied frog leg muscles.</page><page sequence="42">42A American Society of Zoologists 203 STFLCTUFE QF THE TQAEFISH SWIMBLATXER MUBCLES REEXAMINED: MALES AND FEMALES MUST PLAY A DIFFERENT TUNE. Denah Appelt, Barbara Block, and C^ Franzini-Armstrong. Departments of Biology and Anatomy, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pa. 19104. The swimbladder muscles of the toadfish, Opsanus tau, are among the fastest contracting skeletal muscles in the animal kingdom. The rapid oontraction-relaxation cycles (300-400 Hz) are responsible for the volcalizations that both male and female toadf ish produce. As in other sound producing muscles, there is a remarkable increase in the membranes, the transverse tubules (T) and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which are responsible for initiating and controlling the cycling of calcium. From Golgi stained muscle we determined the size and frequency of T-SR junctions and the number of sites for calcium release. Male toadfish have numerous short junctions that alternate with free T segments while females have long extensive junctional T regions. The results indicate that the males have a smaller region of junctional T and thus sites for calcium release may be more limited. Golgi staining also revealed that female toadfish have bundles of fibers that appear to be slow twitch and slow tonic fibers. SDS-PAGE of the SR fraction in both sexes indicates that sites for calcium release and uptake are very high in the swimbladder muscles. The presence of structural dimorphism between the two sexes suggests that males do indeed play a different tune than females. 204 CHANGES IN MUSCLE BIOCHEMISTRY ASSOCIATED WITH METAMORPHOSIS OF DOVER SOLE, Microstomus pacificus. LARVAE. Mary Sue Lowerv. National Marine Fisheries Service, Southwest Fisheries Center, La Jolla, CA During metamorphosis of Dover Sole larvae, skeletal muscle undergoes extensive changes resulting in the acquisition of the biochemical characteristics of adult muscle. This transformation occurs prior to settlement and may preadapt the juvenile fish to its new demersal life style. Protein content of post-metamorphic muscle is twice that of larval muscle. More specific analysis indicates that rather than a simple doubling of existing proteins, there is a shift from non-myofibrillar proteins to myofibrillar proteins as the dominant muscle component. Approximately 50% of larval muscle protein is soluble in a low salt buffer as compared to 20% after metamorphosis. Actin, a myofibrillar protein, comprises only 2% of the larval muscle protein, but comprises 10% of the protein after metamorphosis. Analysis of proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) showed several proteins which were abundant in the soluble fraction of larval tissue and absent after metamorphosis. The muscle RNA/DNA ratio increases during larval growth, but is reduced at metamorphosis. DNA content of the muscle is reduced during larval growth and increases at metamorphosis. These data suggest that protein synthesis and cell size increase until metamorphosis after which there is a reduction and stabilization of these parameters. 205 METABOLIC FUEL PREFERENCE IN MUSCLE TISSUES FROM AN ANTARCTIC FISH, NOTOTHENIA GIBBERIFRONS. E.L.Crockett, B.D.Sidell and W.R.Priedzic*. Univ. of Maine, Orono, and Mt. Allison Univ., Sackville, N.B. Enzymatic and 14C02 evolution studies of substrate selectivity in muscles from an Antarctic fish, Notothenia gibberifrons, reveal a marked preference for unsaturated lipid fuels. Calculations from enzyme activities measured at 1?C suggest that oxidation of palmitoleic acid can yield 3-fold more ATP than oxidation of glucose in skeletal muscle and 1.2-fold more ATP in cardiac muscle. When assayed with substrates of different chain lengths and degrees of saturation, the putative rate-limiting step of beta-oxidation (carnitine palmitoyl- transferase) shows highest activity with monoenoic palmitoleoyl CoA. Metabolic experiments with isolated paced heart preparations confirm primacy of unsaturated fatty substrates. Simultaneous presence of unlabeled monenoic fat (oleic acid) and 14C-labelled saturated fat (palmitic acid) depresses the oxidation rate of the saturated compound by 65%. In the reciprocal experiment (unlabeled palmitic, l&lt;C-oleic), oxidation rate of the monoenoic substrate is unaffected. Combined, these data strongly suggest preference for unsaturated lipid fuel in muscle tissues from a fish that lives at a chronically cold body temperature.

The response of avian flight muscle to short term food deprivation (20 h) was examined in the Horned Lark (EremophiIla alpestris), a 28 g passerine. Increased proteolysis of the flight muscle in fasted birds was evidenced by several criteria: (1) reduetion in gross muscle mass; (2) increased proteolytic enzyme activity in pectoral tissue, aswell as an increase in free alpha amino nitrogen; (3) a slight depletion in the amount of sarcoplasmic muscle protein relative to myofibrillar protein; and (4) ultra? structural changes. An in-vivo assessment of the metabolic capacity of fed and fasted birds using cold exposure in 80% He-20% O2, showed that there was no reduetion in mass specific maximum shivering thermogenesis in fasted birds. In-vitro, oxidative capacity of pectoral tissue as shown by succinic oxidase activity was not reduced in fasted birds, however glycolytic activity as shown by anaerobic lactate production was diminished in fasted birds. These data indicate that flight muscle is actively degraded during fasting in these birds, but without a disproportionate loss of oxidative capacity of the muscle.</page><page sequence="43">Abstracts 43 A 207 INTRACELLULAR pH (pHi) AND D-LACTATE PRODUCTION/EFFLUX DURING ISOTONIC CONTRACTIONS IN A MOLLUSCAN MUSCLE. R.W. Wiseman and W.R. Ellington. Florida State University, Tallahassee. D-Lactate is the predominant glycolytic end product during contractile activity in the radula protractor muscle (RPM) of the whelk Busycon canaliculaturn. Isolated RPM bands were subjected to electrical stimu? lation while superfused with artificial sea water at 20 C in a phosphorus NMR probe. The consequences of the induced isotonic contractions were followed by generating sequential 3 P-NMR spectra during the 30 min time course of contrac? tion. The initial pHi, as estimated using the chemical shift of the Pi resonance, was 7.29+/- 0.05 (SD) while the final pHi was 7.01 ? 0.08, a net decrease of 0.28 units. Conventional biochemical analysis of the tissues and media showed that the total D-lactate production was 65.7 ymoles ? g intracellular water""1. Of this total, 75% was found to be in the medium. Since there is a 1:1 stoichiometry of lactate:H production, it is clear that contractile activity results in the imposition of a substantial acid load on the RPM. Current studies are underway to evaluate the potential role of D-lactate transport in the dissipation of this acid load.

The activity physiology of reptiles is noteworthy for its reliance on anaerobic pathways of energy production. We evaluated the metabolic mechanisms by which the iguanid lizard Dipsosaurus dorsalis dealt with the lactate which accumulated during vigorous exercise. Fasted lizards were run 5 min on a treadmill at 40?C, which elevated whole body lactate to 24 mM and depleted hindlimb glycogen to 70% of resting levels. Exhausted animals were then injected with either U-14C-lactate or U-14C-glucose, and allowed to recover quietly at 40?C. After 2 h, 79% of the accumulated lactate had been removed and hindlimb muscle glycogen stores had returned to pre-exercise levels. Based on isotope distributions, 50% of the lactate removed was used to synthesize glucose and glycogen, while only 16% of the lactate was oxidized and another 7% incorporated into protein. Lactate oxidation accounted for about 40% of the post-exercise VO2. Lactate rather than glucose appeared to be the prevalent substrate for muscle glycogen synthesis under these conditions, although plasma glucose appeared to be the preferred substrate for hepatic glycogen synthesis. These animals appear to employ a strategy of lactate removal which is different than mammals; favoring lactate supported gluconeogenesis and emphasizing rapid muscle glycogen replenishment.

This study investigates the effect of physiologically-valid increments in thyroxine (T4) on energy metabolism in thyroid intact lizards. In two groups of captive Scelooorus occidentalis (SO), T4 levels were increased from 4.8+_0.47 to 10.7+2.25 and 20.4+5.77 ng/ml (mean+SE) by IP implantation of T4- loadecT pellets. In field-active Slo. undulatus (SU), T4 was increased from 7.7+1.45 to 22.7+3.03 ng/ml. T4 increased standard metabolic rate (SMR; p=0.04) and heart mass (p=0.02) and decreased liver mass (p&lt;0.01) in SU but not in SO. Pyruvate kinase activity was increased significantly in liver (p&lt;0.01), heart (p=0.01) and skeletal muscle (p=0.0.04) of SU but was not changed in SO. Cytosolic glycerol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase in liver was significantly decreased by all treatments in SU and SO and was not changed in heart or skeletal muscle. Citrate synthase activity was not changed in any tissue of SU or SO. S. undulatus may be inherently more responsive to T4 than S. occidentalis, or field activity may confer enhanced responsiveness to T4. These data force a re-interpretation of a large body of experimental data on thyroid physiology in captive lizards.

University of Wyoraing, Laramie WY 82071 Five sibling pairs of domestic goats were split into two groups at about two months of age. Half of these animals were run 5 times per week for 15 min. on a treadmill at about 70% of their maximum aerobic capacity (VQ2max). Following 6 months of training, the exercised animals experienced a 24% increase in VQ2inax relative to the controls. However, during the cold Laramie, Wyoming winter, both groups of animals were severely "cold exposed" in temperatures as low as -35 C. During that 3 month period, VQ2inax in the untrained animals increased 29% while VQ2max of the trained animals increased by 15%. Likewise, running speed of both groups increased in proportion to the observed increase in VQ2max, despite the fact that half the animals were not running during the entire three month period. These results suggest that those structures responsible for O2 delivery are malleable and responsive to a variety of stimuli. Further, once those structures are present, they can support very different functions than those which necessarily induced their development.

Swain, D.J. Wells. University of Wyoming, Laramie WY 82071 Pronghorn antelope are among the world's most aerobic mammals, maintaining high speeds over long distances. Hence, we believe they are ideal animals to examine those factors that may be acting to limit the aerobic performance of mammals. Oxygen consumption was measured in two pronghorn antelope trained to run on a treadmill while wearing a light- weight mask for collection of expired gases. Maximum O2 consumption (VQ2max) was measured with the animals running'at about 10 m*s~* up an 11% incline. VQ2inax in the pronghorn antelope was measured to be 307 ml*kg~*'min"" , which is the highest recorded value of O9 consumption for any large mammal (32 kg). For comparison, this value is about 5 times higher than VQ2max in goats of the same size. The antelope have significantly more muscle mass (about 50% higher) much larger tracheal cross-sectional area, lung volume and heart mass than the goats. Despite these differences, in neither species is there any evidence of cardio-vascular O2 delivery limitation to VQ2max.

Scripps Institution of Oceanography, La Jolla, CA In this study, we have examined the response of mitochondrial function to temperature stress. Animals were selected from a wide variety of thermal environments to assess the relationship between thermal resistance and habitat temperature. Mitochondria were subjected to chronic or acute exposure to increasing temperature; the mitochondrial respiratory rate and activities of some mitochondrial enzymes were measured. Acute exposure to temperature results in inactivation of mitochondrial enzyme activities at the same temperature as inactivation of mitochondrial respiration. Chronic thermal stress results in inactivation of mitochondrial respiration and mitochondrial enzyme activities at a lower temperature than does acute thermal stress. Large, interspecific differences in thermal sensitivity were found among species, with cold-adapted species exhibiting lower temperatures of thermal disruption of mitochondrial function. The high temperatures needed to disrupt mitochondrial function of certain hydrothermal vent animals suggest that these species may experience pulses of very high temperatures in situ. 214 FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE UPPER TEMPERATURE LIMIT OF MITOCHONDRIAL respiration. John O'Brien, Elizabeth M. Parks and George N. Somero. Scripps Institution of Oceanography, La Jolla, CA. The upper thermal limit of animals may be difficult to determine for logistical reasons. We have studied the thermal resistance of isolated mitochondria as a simple model, allowing us to determine the mechanisms by which activity is lost. We have measured the rates of succinate-supported mitochondrial respiration and the activities of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), cytochrome c oxidase and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) in the tubeworm Riftia pachyptila. When mitochondria are chronically exposed to heat and subsequently assayed at a physiological temperature, the thermal inactivation temperatures of mitochondrial respiration and enzyme activities differ. SDH activity and succinate- stimulated respiration are inactivated by preincubation above 35?C while cyt. ox. is activated by this treatment. Fluorescence polarization measurements using the hydrophobic probe 1,6 diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene indicate that there is no phase transition at this temperature. A reduetion of bulk membrane fluidity by enrichment of mitochondrial membranes with saturated phospholipid did not change the temperature of cyt. ox. activation or SDH inactivation, though total SDH activity was reduced by 50%. Disruption of hydrophobic interactions with 0.2% sodium deoxycholate caused a 20?C reduetion in the temperatures of cyt. ox. activation and inactivation with no change maximal activity. We conclude that hydrophobic interactions of proteins contribute to the upper thermal limit for mitochondrial function.</page><page sequence="45">Abstracts 45A 215 A GENERAL EXPRESSION FOR THE STANDARD OPERATIVE TEMPERATURE AFFECTING SMALL BIRDS. G.S. Bakken. Indiana State Univ., Terre Haute. Standard operative temperature (Tes) is a useful descriptor of complex thermal environments, but a simple way to determine Tes is needed. Computation of Tes from primary microclimate data, and direct measurement of Tes using heated taxidermic mounts are unpopular due to technical complexity. Tes can also be computed from normal body temperature (Tb), operative temper? ature (Te) measured by an unheated mount, and wind speed (u): es b e es b e provided that the dependence on u of the animal's actual thermal conductance (Ke) and the conductance at the standard u (Kes) is known. Choosing u - 0 as the standard and taking Ke ? a + blu" gives Kes = a, the free-convection conductance. Then (Ke/Kes) = (1 + b/a) JTT. For 5 spp. of passerines, b/a - 0.25 + 0.03. Thus, (Ke/Kes) = 1 + 0.25 Ju~ may be a useful general expression for small birds when the true relation is not known. 216 HOMEOVISCOUS ADAPTATION AND OVER? WINTERING SITE IN BRIHSH WADING BIRDS. Sandra, l, Taylor*, Nancy, u pruitt. and Peter, N. Ferns*. Colgate Univ. Hamilton, NY and University of Wales, Cardiff College, U.K. Changes in fatty acid saturation that compensate for the direct effects of temperature on cellular membranes are well documented in poikilotherms. Peripheral tissues of some homeotherms, including the legs of wading birds, are also subject to changes in temperature.We have analyzed lipids isolated from the legs of two subspecies of Dunlins {Caladris alpina) to determine if the water temperature at overwintering sites affects the degree of saturation. C. a. alpina overwinters in the British Isles at average winter water temperatures of 6? C. Ca. schinzii overwinters in southern France at temperatures ranging from 17? to 22? C. C. a. schinzii are enriched in saturates at the expense of monoenes (primarily oleic acid) relative to leg lipids from C. a. alpina. The unsaturation/saturation ratio (wt % monoenes + polyunsaturates/ wt % saturates) of phospholipids is 3.3 and 2.6 in Cclcl and C. a. s., respectively. For triglycerides, the ratios are 5.7 and 4.0 for C.clcl and C.as., respectively, indicating that overwintering site influences lipid unsaturation in the legs of these coastal waders. 217 EFFECTS OF LOW TEMPERATURE ON REPRODUCTION IN RODENTS. J.Manning, U. of Tx., Austin. In theory, small mammals can maintain reproduction at low temperatures by in? creasing their food intake. However, at some critical low temperature they will no longer be able to do so, and thus will forego reproduction in order to survive. The present experiment tested these theo? retical principles by examining the per- sistence of the ovulatory cycle in adult CF1 mice and Long Evans rats maintained at 7 different temperatures for 28 days. Temperatures were lowered over 10 days from 22 C to either 17, 12, 7, 2, -3, or -8 C. Vaginal smears were taken the last 12 days of the experiment. Half of each temperature group was maintained at 22 C food intake ("maintained") while the other half was allowed to increase their food intake ("increased"). Results: increased mice gave up reproduction for survival be? tween -3 and -8 C. Maintained mice gave up reproduction between 17 and 7, and could not survive at 2 C. Both the main? tained and the increased rats continued to ovulate at all temperatures, despite life- threatening losses of body weight. Main? tained rats could not survive below 2 C. The observed species difference may re? flect different reproductive strategies in response to low ambient temperatures. 218 ASPECTS OF ECOLOGICAL PHYSIOLOGY OF RED SEA ROCKSKIPPER FISH. M.S. Gordon and C.R. Brown. Univ. of California, Los Angeles. Alticus kirki is an amphibious blenny occurring abundantly in rocky intertidal areas in the Red Sea region. The fish are diurnal and spend most of their active time out of water, above but near the tidally varying water line. Their abiotic environment is quite complex, providing then with many choices of conditions. The ability of Alticus kirki to detect variations in temperature, salinity and light quality and quantity were examined in a series of laboratory studies. Temperature preference studies indicate that rockskippers have a narrow thermal preference range near 26?C. Salinity preference studies, however, indicate little ability of the animal to discriminate between waters of different salinities. Rockskippers show a marked preference for remaining in light vs shade when given a choice. An action spectrum indicated that rockskippers can detect light over the visible spectrum (400-700 nm) .

R.B. Huey. CR. Feterson*, S.J. Arnold, and W.P. Porter. Univ. of Washington, Univ. of Chicago, and Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison. Studies of behavioral therrooregulation of ectotherms have typically focused on animals active above ground even though temperate-zone ectotherms actually spend more time sequestered in retreats. To explore the thermal consequences of retreat site selection by garter snakes (Thamnophis elegans), we measured potential body temperatures in various retreats in northeastern California during the summer. We combined these data with information on thermal tolerances, preferences, and thermal dependencies of metabolism and digestion to predict which sites would be physiologically optimal. We tested the predictions with data from telemetered snakes. During much of the day, garter snakes had to avoid the open surface, thin rocks, or shallow burrows because temperatures there exceeded their voluntary thermal maximum (36 C). Except for about an hour in the morning, the best sites for maintaining preferred body temperatures (28-32 C) were under medium thickness rocks (25-30 an thick) and the snakes usually selected these rocks as retreat sites. 220 AT WHAT SIZE ARE TUNAS ABLE TO ELEVATE MUSCLE TEMPERATURES SIGNIFICANTLY? K. A. Dickson, Calif. State Univ., Fullerton, CA, and Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, La Jolla, CA. Black skipjack tuna (Euthynnus lineatus) juveniles [10-20 mm fork length (FL)],captured by nightlighting, were raised to larger sizes at the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission laboratory in Achotines, Panama. In addition, larger specimens were obtained by trolling feathered jigs from the R/V Roncador. Bailey BAT copper constantan thermocouples inserted into the fish*s body were used to measure maximal muscle temperatures (Tm) and ambient water temperature (Ta), and Tx (Tm-Ta) values were calculated. Fish of 15.5-114.7 mm FL had maximal Tx of 0-2.5 + 0.5?C (N=14). The largest lab raised fish, FL 279 mm, had a significantly elevated Tm (Tx = 3.8?C). Fish caught at sea (319-543 mm FL; N=10) had maximal Tx = 4.0-7.0?C. Therefore, black skipjack tuna acquire the ability to elevate deep muscle temperatures significantly when they are between 115 and 279 mm FL. These data will be compared with measurements of heat exchanger development and size. 221 INSPIRED CO AND THE CONTROL OF BREATHING IN GARTER SNAKES AND GECKO LIZARDS. R.A. Furilla and IL_ Bartlett, Jr.* Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, N.H. This study was undertaken to gain a better understanding of the role of IPCs in the control of breathing. Snakes and lizards were tracheostomized to reraove the influence of upper airway receptors. Animals were unidirectionally ventilated or allowed to ventilate normally, but without glottal control of the breath- hold. When a bidirectionally breathing snake was presented with CO. at the tracheal tube, inspiratory duration and volume decreased. When CO. was removed from the inspired air, inspiratory dura? tion and volume increased. Removing C09 from the airstream of a unidirectionally ventilated snake during a breath-hold produced apnea, but removing C0_ at the beginning of inspiration caused the dura? tion and volume of that inspiration to increase. None of these maneuvers caused a significant change in inspiration in geckos until at least the second breath after the maneuver. Therefore, if IPCs are present in geckos, and IPCs are re? sponsible for the response seen in snakes, then geckos integrate this infor? mation differently from snakes.

The Univ. of Chicago. Theoretical considerations and anecdotal observations suggest that oxygen boundary layers surrounding animals in water should pose a significant resistance to cutaneous oxygen exchange, but the magnitude of this resistance has never been determined directly. With oxygen microelectrodes, we measured the oxygen boundary layer surrounding a variety of amphibians submerged in normoxic water. The P02 at the skin-water interface was usually less than 20 Torr in still water, demonstrating that the boundary layer can offer a profound resistance to cutaneous gas exchange. Both the size of the boundary layer and the severity of hypoxia at the skin-water interface were related to the speed of water flow past the skin. The ventilatory environment of the skin can affect respiratory and other behaviors. In diving frogs {Xenopus) obtaining oxygen via cutaneous uptake from water, cessation of cutaneous ventilation (which presumably decreased the PO2 at the skin-water interface) increased air-breathing frequency, decreased dive duration, and increased routine voluntary movement. The data demonstrate that diffusion boundary layers are large and can significantly affect overall gas exchange in skin- breathing vertebrates.

Furilla, and W.W Burftgren. Univ. of Mass., Amherst and Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, N.H. The average pulmonary exchange ratio (R. ) for intermittently breathing ectotherms is low (&lt; 0.5). In aquatic animals this is primarily due to the extrapulmonary release of CO^. The purpose of this study was to investigate 1) the contribution of skin gas exchange to total C02 excretion, 2) the effect of ventilatory pattern on pulmonary and skin C02 excretion and 3) the CO^ storage capacity of. oxygenated aDd aeoxygenated blood in a terrestrial reptile. Ventilation and pulmonary and skin gas exchange were measured simultaneously in 8 snakes. Skin exchange accounted for up to 20% of total C0? excretion. Skin transfer increased during long periods of apnea. During periods of low breathing frequency R. was low. If the animal switched to high frequency breathing, R. increased to values greater than 1.0 over several breaths. High rates of ventilation promote pulmonary C0? depletion through concurrent increases in pulmonary perfusion and the release of blood C02 stores via the Haldane elfect. 224 A NEW MYOGLOBIN FUNCTION IN HEART CELLS. J, E, Doeller and B, A, Wittenberg*. A- Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, N.Y. Myoglobin (Mb) enhances the transport of oxygen to mitochondria when oxygen is limiting. In the presence of superabundant oxygen, specific inactivation ot Mb by nitrite (or CO; Wittenberg and Wittenberg, 1987) in isolated heart cells significantly decreases the steady state respiratory oxygen uptake, suggesting a function of Mb in addition to oxygen transport. Mb inactivation by nitrite also significantly decreases the phosphocreatine/ATP (PC/ATP) and the ATP/ADP ratios. lodo- acetate, a glycolytic inhibitor, does not itself affect ATP or PC levels. Mb inactivation in the presence of iodoacetate causes a significant drop in both ATP and PC levels and tne ATP/ADP ratio. Rotenone, an inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation, decreases the level of PC and the PC/ATP ratio, but does not change the ATP level. Now Mb inactivation further decreases the PC level without significantly affecting the ATP level. Assuming a constant ATP utilization rate, these data demonstrate that functional Mb enhances the rate of ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation in heart cells at three different energetic states where oxygen supply is not limiting.

Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Woods Hole, MA and 20regon Institute of Marine Biology, Charleston. We examined hemocyanin structure in the four larval stages and the adult of Homarus americanus. PAGE gels run of native proteins show adult hemolymph contains about 35% hexameric and 65% 2-hexameric forms of hemocyanin. Ninety-six percent of the hemocyanin from Stage I larvae is in the hexameric form; in Stage II larvae 80% is hexameric. Stage III larvae possess 50-60% of their hemocyanin in hexamers. Stage IV larvae show the same pattern as adults. SDS gels reveal that the same three subunits make up hexamers from all the larval stages and both the hexamers and 2-hexamers of Stage IV larvae and adults. All hemocyanin composed of these three subunits shows an oxyhemocyanin absorbance peak at 335 nm. Hexamers from adults show no peak at 335 nm and consist of only 2 subunits, at least one of which is unique from the 3 mentioned above. These shifts in hemocyanin structure differ from that of crab species. 226 THE LARGE-SCALE DISTRIBUTION OF THE HETEROGENEOUS HEMOCYANIN SUBUNITS OF CAL? LINECTES SAPIDUS (RATHBUN) ALONG A SALIN? ITY GRADIENT. J.S. Rainer. College of William and Mary, Wil1iamsburg, VA The hemocyanin of C. sapidus consists of a mix of dodecamer and hexamer aggregates of various combinations of 6 heterogen? eous polypeptides (subunits). These sub? units* which contains an active site to transport oxygen, are electrophoretically distinct. Densiometric scans of these 6 bands from individual crabs show alter? native phenotypes for ^ out of the 6 in the apparent concentration produced. Integration of the area under the scanned peaks documents this observation. In this study phenotypes from 3 out of the ^ are combined to form B phenotype pat? terns which have been recovered from crabs sampled from the York river system and the Virginia eastern shore. The change in these phenotypes and phenotype patterns is not correlated with the Hc concentration or length of the crabs. The differences do not indicate a clear and simple clinal distribution but rather similarities are seen at the extremes which are different from the mid range salini ties.</page><page sequence="48">48A American Society of Zoologists 227 EXTRACTS OF ALASKAN MARINE ALGAE ACTIVE AGAINST A SALMON PATHOGEN. M.S. Stekoll and C Good . Univ. of Alaska, Juneau. Since the early 1950's a number of investigations have been done in attempts to discover extracts from marine org? anisms that have biological activity. Most of these studies have been directed to human medical needs. There have been few studies that have investigated the activity of these extracts against fish pathogens. The salmon hatcheries in Alaska have chronic problems with micro- bial contamination of eggs grown in close proximity to each other in stacked incu- bators and with fish held in crowded conditions. Methods of combating such infections are currrently very limited. Aqueous extracts of various species of marine algae were tested, by a filter paper disc bioassay, for activity against Aeromonas salmonisida, the causative agent of fish furunculosis. An active extract has been obtained from the red alga, Constantinea sp. The active prin? ciple appears to be smaller than 30,000 daltons, is water soluble, but not sol? uble in non-polar solvents, and is heat labile. The activity of this extract is a linear function of its concentration using a filter paper disc assay in vitro. We are currently attempting to purify and characterize the active component. 228 AMINO ACID UPTAKE BY THE OLFACTORY ORGAN OF THE SPINY LOBSTER. H.G. TRAPIDO- ROSENTHAL, S. WACHOCKI* M. OTTO* and W.E. S. CARR* Whitney Laboratory, University of Florida, St. Augustine, Florida. The olfactory organ of the spiny lobster, Panulirus argus, consists of a dense array of aesthetasc sensilla on the lateral branch of the antennule. These sensilla contain primary chemosensory neurons that are in intimate contact with seawater and its low molecular weight solutes. Among these neurons are those that respond to either glutamate or taurine. The studies we report here show that sensillar cells also have the ability to internalize these two amino acids from seawater. Each amino acid is transported by a separate, highly specific, sodium- dependent uptake system, which can work against large concentration gradients. Uptake rates are half-maximal at micro- molar concentrations of extracellular amino acids. Studies with competitors for the uptake of taurine demonstrate that this uptake system can reinternalize taurine that has leaked from cells of the olfactory organ into the receptor environ? ment. We conclude that in the aesthetasc sensilla of P. argus, amino acid uptake systems may serve as a mechanism for maintaining the sensitivity of receptor cells to amino acids from exogenous sources. 229 PROLINE TRANSPORT BY LOBSTER ANTENNAL GLANDS. R^_ D^ Behnke*, R.K. Wong*, S.M. Huse*, S. J. Reshkin, and G^ A^ Ahearn. Univ. Hawaii, Honolulu. 3H-L-proline transport by purified brush border membrane vesicles of lobster (Homarus americanus) antennal gland laby- rinth and bladder were compared. L-pro- line influxes and overshoot properties were significantly greater in labyrinth vesicles. Detailed study of labyrinth proline transport revealed a specific dependence on external NaCl with no stimulatory effects by NaSCN, Na-gluco- nate, or KC1. Inward gradients of Na and Cl were synergistic in stimulating pro? line transfer, while an inward H gradient was without effect on amino acid trans? port. A transmembrane K diffusion poten? tial (inside -; K/valinomycin) enhanced proline uptake in NaCl-gradient and NaCl- equilibrated conditions suggesting electrogenic amino acid transport. Pro? line influx occurred by at least one saturable carrier system (Kt =0.37 mM; % = 1.19 nmol/mg protein / 10 see) and apparent diffusion (P = 0.33 nmol/mg protein / 10 see / mM). Proline influx was a sigmoidal function of variable Na0 and a hyperbolic function of variable Cl0 suggesting an influx stoichiometry of 2 Na: 1 Cl: 1 proline. Supported by NSF grant no.

Extracellular calcium concretions in the gills of freshwater unionids consist of calcium complexed to phosphate associated with an electron dense organic matrix. In the organic matrix there are four glycoproteins with molecular weights greater than 150 KDa. In order to study incorporation of phosphate into concretion protein, we have developed an organ culture media based on Ham's F-12 vertebrate tissue media. ^Cultured gill strips exposed to 24uCi PO, incorporate 10 cpm/mg into the whole gill protein fraction. Isolated concretions contain 10 cpm/mg. Following SDS/mercaptoethanol isolation of concretion proteins and SDS-PAGE, the PO incorporation appears to be primarily associated with a 200 KDa protein, and a higher molecular weight complex which does not enter a 6% PAGE gel. Concretion material also contains 6% hydrophobic material which may be acidic phospholipids. These organic components may be important in control of the mineralization process.

Sikes* and K.C. Low.* Clemson Univ., SC, and Univ. of South Alabama, Mobile. Soluble matrix protein from the CaCO_ shell of the oyster Crassostrea virginica has been partially sequenced. Its amino acid composition is 80-90% aspartate (Asp), glycine (Gly), and serine (Ser). The Asp is distributed largely as polyAsp rather than as (Asp-X) or (Asp-X-Y) with X and Y being either Ser or Gly. To es? tablish the significance of these findings, interactions of synthetic analogs having various deployments of the three amino acids with CaCO seed crystals were followed in botn crystal growth and adsorption assays. The order of efficacy of the peptides as inhibitors in the crystal growth assay was (Asp) &gt; (Asp-X)&gt; (Asp-X-Y) . Using the Langmuir isotherm model to mterpret adsorption data, the relative number of high affinity sites on the crystals for the peptides follows the same order. Therefore, (Asp) appears to interact with more of the crystal surfaces than other amino acid sequences, thus partially explaining their efficacy in crystal growth assays and possibly the inclusion of polyAsp sequences in biomineral growth regulators such as oyster matrix proteins. 232 EGGSHELL AND ALBUMEN FORMATION IN TURTLES. B. D. Palmer. University of Florida, Gainesville. Understanding albumen and eggshell formation in reptiles may provide insight into the evolution of amniotic eggs. This study analyzed structure, function, and biochemistry of oviducts and eggs from Pseudemys scripta, Chrysemys picta, Sternotherus odoratus, Trionyx ferox, and Gopherus polyphemus using electron microscopy, in vitro tissue culture and electrophoresis. Two types of microvillous secretory cells line the oviductal lumen, and the infundibulum contains formerly unde- scribed bleb secretory cells which have a smooth apical membrane. The tubal endometrial glands have large, irregular shaped secretory granules of various electron densities. The albumen of turtle eggs is secreted by the tube of the oviduct and is composed predom? inantly of ovotransferrin, indicating that turtle albumen is different in composition than avian albumen. The uterine endometrial glands contain spherical, membrane bound secretory granules of uniform electron density. These glands produce the fibrous membranes of the eggshell. Therefore, the uterus is unique in forming both the fibrous and calcareous eggshell layers. 233 CATALYTIC AND REGULATORY PROPERTIES OF PYRUVATE KINASE FROM THE FOOT, MANTLE AND DIGESTIVE GLAND OF HELIX ASPERSA. J. H. A. Fields. Univ. of San Diego. Pyruvate kinase was partially purified from the foot, mantle and digestive gland of active and aestivating snails. Their kinetic properties were determined at pH 7.0 and 6.5. At pH 7.0 the apparent K values for phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) were 0.064 mM for the enzyme from foot and 0.071 mM for the enzyme from mantle; those for ADP were 0.35 mM for the foot enzyme and 0.33 mM for the mantle enzyme. Both enzmes were inhibited by alanine and this could be reversed by fructose 1,6-bis- phosphate (FDP). FDP alone had little effect on these enzymes. Decreasing the pH to 6.5 markedly increased the inhibi? tion by alanine and reduced the response to FDP. The enzymes from these tissues of aestivating snails showed small changes in their catalytic properties as compared with those from active snails. The enzyme from the digestive gland can exist in two kinetically distinct forms. One shows hyperbolic saturation kinetics with respect to PEP and the other shows sig- moidal saturation kinetics for this substrate; however there is no clear indication that either form is prevalent during the active or aestivating states. 234 KINETIC PROPERTIES OF P0LYM0RPHIC ENZYMES IN EISENIA FOETIDA (OLIGOCHAETA: LUMBRICIDAE).

Previously, multilocus heterozygosity for several loci in carbohydrate metabolism (Gpdh2, Hk2, Ldh1, Pgm, Mdh, Ldh2) was positively correlated with growth in J3. foetida. Determining the kinetic properties of enzymes encoded by these loci and distinguishing them from isozymes not participating in this relationship is a prerequisite for elucidating any mechanism. At pH 7.6, LDH1 (Vmax =2.56 nmoles/min per mg protein, Km = 14.82 mM) principally catalyzes the conversion of lactate to pyruvate; whereas, LDH2 (Vmax = 169.8, Km = 3.43) catalyzes only the reverse reaction. GPDH2 has a similar Vmax (14.70) but significantly lower Km (0.269) compared to GPDH1 (Vmax = 11.29, Km = 10.5) in the direction of glycerol- 3-P to DHAP. Two HK loci have yet to be distinguished kinetically from each other (Vmax = 28.06, Km = 0.160). PGM (Vmax = 1.80 umoles/min per mg protein, Km = 0.226) and MDH (Vmax =2.20 umoles/min per mg protein, Km = 0.018), each encoded by a single locus, have the highest activities among enzymes examined.</page><page sequence="50">50A American Society of Zoologists 235 KINETIC PROPERTIES OF CYTOPLASMIC VS. MITOCHONDRIAL ARGININE PHOSPHOKINASE FROM HORSESHOE CRAB HEARTS. C. Doumen and W.R. Ellington. Florida State Univ., Tallahassee. A kinetic analysis was performed on highly purified cytoplasmic arginine phos- phokinase (APKc; ARG-P + MgADP + H+ *-&gt; ARG + MgATP) and mitochondrially-bound APK (APKm) from Limulus polyphemus hearts. Kinetic analysis using the coupling enzyme method on the single APKc form and the APKm in non-respiring mitochondria showed no significant kinetic differences with respect to the substrates MgADP, ARG-P and ARG. The Km's for MgATP were 1.08 ? 0.19 and 0.65 ? 0.29 mM, respectively. Kinetic data obtained by measurement of arginine- stimulated state 3 respiration in the presence of ATP yielded a similar Km value for ATP of 0.57 ? 0.05 mM. An analysis of saturation kinetics with respect to ATP by direct measurement of Arg-P production in respiring and non-respiring mitochondria resulted in comparable results (0.28 ? .03 vs 0.45 ? .08 mM, respectively). The absence of a dramatic increase in affinity of APKm for MgATP in respiring mito? chondria supports the conclusion that there is no functional coupling between APKm and the adenine nucleotide trans- locator (ANT) in heart mitochondria of the horseshoe crab.

Leibel. Lafayette College, Easton, PA 18042 The extent to which the three LDH genes (A,B,C) exhibit allelic polymorphism was examined in both wild and commercially- inbred strains of the Angelfish cichlid. Our electrophoretic survey revealed that: 1. There was no interstrain variability in LDH-A,B, or C in the inbred fish des? pite evidence of drastic mutation in these strains, 2. The individual mobilities of each LDH-B,, C , and their heterotetramers from wild Peruvian, wild Brazilian, and commercially-inbred strains were identi? cal, 3. Three electromorphs of the muscle specific LDH-A locus , 'fast' (Peru, Am- biayacu n = 25 and Brazilian n =51, pl = 7.4), 'slow' (Peru, Ucayali n = 87, pl = 8.0), and 'faster* (Brazilian, n = 5, pl =7.0) were detected in the wild fish. The 'fast' electromorph was identical with that found uniformly in all cultivated fish presumably due to initial founder effect and subsequent stringent conserva? tion. With the exception of the rare 'faster' allele which occurred as a co- dominant heterozygote with the 'fast' al? lele (4 of 5), both 'fasf and 'slow* al? leles were fixed in their respective pop? ulations. 237 VITELLIN SYNTHESIS IN RELATION TO OOGENESIS IN IN VITRO INCUBATED OVARIES OF PENAEUS SEMISCULATUS. CL. Browdy*, M. Fainzilber*. M. Tom, E^ Lubzens and Y. Loya*t. Israel Oceanographic &amp; Limnological Research, Haifa, Israel; and tUniversity of Tel-Aviv, Ramat-Aviv, Israel. Intraovarian vitellin (Vt) synthesis was found in in vitro incubated ovarian lobes removed from females at various stages of oogenesis. The incorporation of 14C leucine into total protein (Pt) and vitellin (Pvt) was determined by TCA and radioimmuno- precipitation, respectively. Fluorography of PAGE gels was used to visualize the relative distribution of synthesized proteins. The rela? tive amount of Vt (Pyt/PTXlOO) was found to depend on the average oocyte diameter. Low levels of Vt synthesis (0-9%) were detected in ovaries with previtellogenic oocytes (diameter 29-38 pm). An average of 39% of the newly synthesized proteins were immunoreactive to Vt in vitellogenic ovaries (100-280 pm). The relative Vt synthesis was reduced in mature oocytes with cortical crypts (350-360 pm), which may reflect the PAS positive egg jelly, extruded from the eggs after ovulation. Rela? tively small differences were found in the ratio Pvt/PT between several sections removed from one ovary. This suggests the possibility of using this system as a bioassay. 238 THE DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES OF CREATINE KINASE ACTIVITY IN THE NEONATAL SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RAT BRAIN J.A. Peters and R.H. Buchholz Monmouth College, Monmouth, IL We have shown that there exists a significant difference between the creatlne kinase (CK) activities of the 15 and 20 day male and female rat brain areas. Male and female rats aged 20 days displayed a greater CK activity than the 15 day males and females (p &lt; 0.005). The cerebellum showed a greater CK activity (p &lt; 0.005) than the hypothalamus, thalamus, medulla, left and right cerebral hemispheres for rats of ages 15-40 days.

R.C. Tinsley (intro. by M.L,.Uorn). yueen Mary uoiiege, London Univ.,U.K. The desert toads, Scaphiopus, have an annual activity season of only 6-8 weeks/year. Few parasites exploit this elusive target but the monogenean Pseudodiplorchis americanus infects over bu% ot b.coucmi. l nis parasite is transmitted by an aquatic iarva ana each year's invasion is concentrated into less than 24h when the toads enter water to spawn. This natural system has key attributes for testing the effect of parasites on host mate choice. The toads starve during the 10 month hiber? nation and high burdens of the blood-feeding farasites depress host fat stores. The toads ypically spawn on the first night after hiber? nation - before they replenish reserves. Male chorusing is energetically demanding. Each mating assembly is limited by nocturnal act? ivity to a max of 7 h : male competition is intense and mate selection is principally by female choice. Parasite burdens are higher in males than females (due to longer exposure of males in water). There are major differences in parasite survival in individual hosts, sugges- tive of resistance : 50% of males infected m one season lose their parasites before the next but some carry heavy burdens. However, ext? ensive field tnals show no correlation between mate success and parasite burden. Two factors are important in interpreting this result. The long period when transmission is precluded (364 days/year) will promote selection for avirulence : parasites which prejudice host survival would not complete their life cycles. Parasite transmission is triggered by host sex? ual activity : so the most successful parasites (which transmit their offspring) occur in the most successful hosts (which are not disadvantaged in sexual selection). 285 mmG SYSTEM VHWIICN W WOCCBXJSE'S Txm. B. Kr SnTHran, rjhiversity of Maine, Grcno. fckting system variation was studied in two disjunct populations of Wbodhouse's toad CBufo woojhousii). In the population with an extended hreeding period, 15-30 % of the males mated and scme males mated with up to three females. By contrast, in the porjulation with a short breeding seascrv 11- 15 % of the males cbtained mates and none mated polygynously. Cperational sex ratios were strongly male-biased and ranged frcm 0 to 0.5 in the population with a prolonged breeding period, and frcm 0 to 0.2 in the explosively breeding form. For both populations these male-biased cperational sex ratios resulted in relatively hic^i intensities of selection as ctmputed frcm the mean and variance in male reproobctive success. Two alternative repnxiictive tactics, satellite and active-searching behaviors, were only exhibited by males unoer high densities in the population with a short breeding period. Althcx#i cperational sex ratios were low, mating was rardcm by male size, number of nights of chorus activity, and calling behavior in the explosively breeding population. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of reobced selectivity on the part of time- limited females in the population with a short breeding period. 287 PARASITE LOADS AND MALE SECONDARY SEX CHARACTERISTICS IN FREE-RANGING RED JUNGLEFOWL. K. Johnson and M. Zuk (intro. by D. Nanney). Univ. of Illinois, Urbana, and Univ. of New Mexico, Albuquerque. We measured feather and comb lengths, testis size, body size, and feather colors on a sample of free-ranging male red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) from the San Diego Zoo. We recorded levels of Ascaridia and total gut parasites and used discriminant function analysis to determine differences between parasitized and parasite-free birds. Parasite-free birds had larger testes than parasitized birds. The discriminant analysis showed parasite-free and parasitized individuals to be significantly different in a combination of feather size and color measures, but not in overall body size. These results will be discussed in light of female preferences for male secondary sex characteristics. 288 PATTERNS OF PARASITE INFECTION IN THE GUPPY. A.M. Lvles. Princeton University, N.J. Throughout this century, the livebearing fish Poecilia reticulata has been an important subject of evolutionary and genetic studies. The guppy's striking male color polymorphism is mediated by predation and female choice. More recently, attention has turned to another selective agent: parasites. However, guppy-parasite experiments have been conducted in the absence of information on the natural history of infections. In this paper I present data from field surveys of guppy parasites in Trinidad; laboratory experiments provide supplementary data. At least five different parasite species infect wild guppies. The prevalence and intensity of infections vary widely between study sites and years. Individual fish seem to acquire infections as they reach sexual maturity. Infections reduce survival rates and males tend to be more susceptible to infection than females. In the field, there is no obvious relation between parasite burdens and colorfulness of males.</page><page sequence="52">52A American Society of Zoologists 289 SEXUAL DIMORPHISM AND SEXUAL SELECTION IN THE LIZARD, CNEMIDOPHORUS TIGRIS. R.A. Anderson. SREL, Aiken, SC. Sexual dimorphism, its causes and consequences, were investigated in an observational field study of Cnemidophorus tigris in the Sonoran Desert Scrub of California. Adult males were larger than equal-aged adult females. Adult males also had larger heads and heavier bodies than females of equal length. Young adult males grew faster than young adult females. Behavioral observations showed the advantage of larger males. Larger males won intrasexual aggressive encounters. The largest quarter among males were involved in over half the mating pairs. The opportunity for male- male competition was enhanced by such features as rapid movement by males over a large home range with good visibility, home range overlap with many individuals, and reproductive asynchrony among females. The only hypothesis consistent with the evidence as a cause of large, heavy-bodied male C. tigris is sexual selection. 290 SEXUAL SELECTION IN CRABS: TESTING THE NULL HYPOTHESIS. M. L. Botton and R. E. Loveland*, Fordham Univ., New York, N.Y. and Rutgers Univ., New Brunswick, N.J. Size relationships between males and females in mated pairs of marine arthropods are frequently interpreted in terms of sexual selection. For example, when large males mate more frequently than small males, explanations based on male-male competition and/or female choice may be invoked. Rarely, however, is the appropriate null hypothesis explicitly tested: Could observed mated pairs merely be the result of "random collisions" between males and females, given their size frequency distributions in the breeding population? We provide a model for testing this hypothesis. It can be applied to any species using size data from mated pairs and unmated sexually mature adults. Testing the model with horseshoe crabs, Limulus polyphemus, showed that the random collision hypothesis accurately predicted the observed size patterns among mated pairs. 291 NON-HERITABLE VARIANCE IN MALE PARENTAL QUALITY CAN RESULT IN THE EVOLUTION OF EPIGAMIC TRAITS: A POPULATION GENETIC MODEL. Guv A. Hoelzer. Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721. The evolution of epigamic traits has been the subject of much controversy over the past decade. The debate has focussed on the relative importance of the Fisherian Runaway Process versus the Good Genes mechanism. A haploid population genetic model is presented here for a third mechanism of epigamic evolution: the Good Parent mechanism. The model shows that variance in male parental quality, heritable or not, along with female choice for good fathers can produce selection for traits that honestly advertise such quality. The more clearly the trait reveals quality, the more likely it will spread through the population and become fixed. The model further suggests that the Good Parent mechanism should be considerably more powerful than the Good Genes mechanism for all systems in which males invest materially in their offspring. 292 RESOURCE DEFENSE AND SEXUAL SELECTION ON MALE HEAD SIZE IN THE LIZARD UTA PALMERL Diana K. Hews. University of Texas, Austin. Male Utapalmeri lizards are larger than females in mass, head width, head depth and jaw length, controlling for differences in SVL. I measured mating success during an entire breeding season to estimate relative fitness of all adult males on the study grid. Using Lande and Arnold's techniques to analyze directional selection, I found that deeper heads and shorter jaws were favored within a cohort. Food addition experiments during the breeding season revealed that females will shift home ranges into supplemented areas, whereas males do not alter territory boundaries. Thus mate selection by females may not be based on male traits, since most females mate with the owner of the territory on which their home range is located. Male-male competition, arising from differential resource holding potential, appears to be the major form of sexual selection. Within a cohort not all males are territorial, and territorial males have larger heads than non-territorial males. In staged male-male encounters, I compared the number of trials in which winners were larger or smaller than losers, and found that winning was associated only with deeper heads and shorter jaws, as predicted by the results of the selection analysis.</page><page sequence="53">Abstracts 53A 293 MAINTENANCE OF MHC POLYMORPHISM IN MUS: MALE HETEROZYGOTE ADVANTAGE AND DISASSORTATIVE REPRODUCTIVE SELECTION. Wayne K, PqUs, C, Jo Manning, Edward K. Wakeland*. University of Florida, Gainesville, University of Washington, Seattle. Gene products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are responsible for the presentation of antigens to T-lymphocytes during the initiation of immune responses. It is generally assumed that MHC heterozygote advantage, through increased disease resistance, accounts for the maintenance of the extreme degree of MHC polymorphisms, although other mechanisms such as disassortative mating and seiective abortion have been suggested. To distin? guish between these hypotheses we are measuring components of fitness in semi-natural, captive, populations of Mus domesticus. These individuals possess four lab derived MHC haplotypes on wild genetic backgrounds. More females settled in the territories of MHC heterozygous males than expected from random association of founders (p&lt;.001, males: n=29, females: n=72). This was due both to a higher probability of heterozygous males acquiring a terri? tory (p=.045) and mean harem sizes that were two times larger than territorial homozygous males (n.s.). In terms of MHC haplotype sharing, female settle? ment in male territories did not differ from random. However, the production of MHC heterozygous off- spring exceeded random mating expectations (p=.0003, n=116). These results suggest a role for both heterozygote advantage and reproductive mech? anisms in the maintenance of MHC polymorphisms. 294 CHANGES IN THE PLASMA LEVELS OF MATURATION-INDUCING STEROIDS IN SEVERAL PERCIFORM FISHES DURING INDUCED OVULATION P. Thomas. The University of Texas Marine Science Institute, Port Aransas. Recently a novel maturation-inducing steroid (MIS), 17a,2Q3,21-trihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (20/3-S), has been identified in two marine perciform fishes, Atlantic croaker and spotted seatrout. To investigate whether 20/3-S is present and could possibly function as a MIS in other perciforms, changes in plasma 20/3-S levels were monitored by RIA in five other species during induced ovulation. Immunoreactive 20/3-S was detected in all five species; tilapia, striped bass, orangemouth corvina, seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax). and snook. Ovulation was associated with elevated levels of 20/3-S in all species investigated. Another putative MIS, 17a,20/3-dihydroxy-4- pregnen-3-one (17a,20/3P), was also found in the plasma of these fishes. The relative proportions of the two C21 steroids in the blood of ovulating fish varied among species. 20/3-S was the predominant C21 steroid in sea bass, orangemouth corvina, snook and tilapia, whereas 17a,20/3-P was present in greater amounts in striped bass. The results suggest that 20/3-S, which has been shown to be a major MIS in two perciform species, may also participate in the natural induction of final oocyte maturation in other members of this teleost order. 295 MEASUREMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OF BINDING ACTIVITY FOR THE MATURATION- INDUCING STEROID IN PLASMA MEMBRANE PREPARATIONS FROM SPOTTED SEATROUT OVARY. R. Patino and P. Thomas. The University of Texas Marine Science Institute, Port Aransas. We determined the binding of radioactive 17a, 20/3,2 l-trihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (20/3-S) to plasma membranes from spotted seatrout ovaries. Ovarian tissue in the stage preceding final oocyte matura? tion was homogenized and fractionated by centrifug- ation. Bound 20/3-S was separated from free steroid by filtration of plasma membrane suspensions. Bind? ing of 20/3-S to membranes reached equilibrium within 5 min at 08C. The binding was saturable, pH- dependent (optimum, 7.5-7.8), and linearly related to protein concentration. Scatchard analysfc showed high-affinity (KD, 10"9M; density, 10"14 mole/mg protein) as well as low-affinity (Kr&gt; 10'5M; density, 10"11 mole/mg) binding sites. C21 steroids displaced the tracer from the high affinity sites as follows: 20/3-S (Kr&gt; 2x 10"9M)&gt; progesterone (8xlO"9M)&gt;ll- deoxycorticosterone (5xl0"^M) &gt; 17a,20/3-dihydroxy-4- pregnen-3-one (2xlO"'M). Our results suggest the presence of high-affinity, low-capacity receptors for maturation-inducing steroid (MIS) associated with oocyte plasma membranes of teleosts. The dissocia? tion constant of these sites in seatrout was 100- to 1000-fold lower than those reported for MIS recep? tors in amphibian oocyte membranes. The relative lack of specificity of MIS receptors appears common to all vertebrate species studied to date. 296 THE MECHANISM CONTROLLING THE SHIFT FROM TESTICULAR ANDROGEN TO PROGESTOGEN PRODUCTION DURING SPAWNING IN MALE COMMON CARP (Cyprinus carpio). T.P. Barry, K^ Aida, and I. Hanyu*. Univ. of Hawaii, Honolulu, and Univ. of Tokyo, Japan. The production of 11-ketotestosterone (11KT) from cultured testicular fragments was enhanced by purified carp GTH (50, 100, 500 ng/ml), oPRL (100 ng/ml), carp pituitary extract (1, 10, 100 mg/ml), pregnenolone (10, 50, 100, 200 ng/ml), 17a-hydroxyprogesterone (17P, 100 ng/ml), and testosterone (T, 100 ng/ml). Sperm preparations produced low levels of 11KT when incubated with T, but not GTH or 17P. Both testicular fragments and sperm preparations produced 17a,2O0-dihydroxy- 4-pregnen-3-one (17.20P) when incubated with 17P. 17,20P (3, 30, 300, 3000 ng/ml) significantly inhibited the production of 11KT in the presence of GTH (0.5 ug/ral), 17P, and T. We conclude that during spawning in male carp, 17,20P is produced by mature sperm cells in response to the GTH surge, and inhibits both the conversion of 17P to androgens, and T to 11KT by steroidogenic somatic cells of the testes.

J. S. Smith and P. Thomas. The University of Texas Marine Science Institute, Port Aransas. Physiologic variation of hepatic estrogen receptor (ER) was studied during the period of ovarian recrudescence and subsequent ovulatory cycles of a naturally spawning, wild population of spotted seatrout. ER concentrations markedly increased during recrudescence from 0.16 to 1.12 pmol/g liver in nuclear extracts (nER) and from 0.78 to 3.23 pmol/g liver in cytosolic extracts (cER). These increases were correlated with rises in plasma estradiol and vitellogenin titers. In separate laboratory studies, exogenously administered estradiol also increased the levels of both cER and nER. During the ovulatory cycle, changes in nER concentrations paralleled the changes in plasma estradiol titers, while cER concentrations did not vary from the elevated levels found in females with postvitellogenic ovaries (2.77-3.23 pmol/g liver). Nuclear ER also appears in response to estrogen in in. vitro liver perfusions. These observations may reflect increased affinity of an activated ER for the DNA-binding site. The accumulation of nER over several ovulatory cycles during the reproductive season may be related to the persistence of ER or its messenger. 298 INITIAL PUKEETCATION STUDIES OF AROMATASE IN GCLDFISH (Carausius auratus) BRAIN. K. Qorina and G.V. Callard. Boston Univ., MA. Aroinatase, a mernber of a cytochrome P450 supergene family, catalyzes estrogen form? ation in both glandular and non-glandular tissues. Although aromatase has recently been purified from human placenta and rat ovary, the molecular relatedness of these aromatases to that in brain has not been compared, nor has the cellular location in neural tissues been determined. Using a teleost fish in.which brain aromatase is 100- to 1000-times higher than in memmals, we have begun isolation studies. We re? port here progress with standard protein purification methods, P450 spectral anal? ysis, iimiunoblotting and cDNA hybridiza- tion techniques. Together with previous studies of the aromatization reaction per se, results obtained indicate that the aroinatase enzyme complex has been con- served through evolution and in different tissue-types. Our ultimate goals are to characterize the goldfish aromatase gene and to develop specific probes for deter? mining how the enzyme is regulated in neural tissues and the spatial relation? ship between aromatase-containing and estrogen target cells.

In elasmobranchs gonadotropins are secre? ted from the morphologically distinct ven? tral lobe (VL) of the pituitary. This lobe is unique in that it is vascularized by the internal carotid arteries rather than by the hypothalamic portal vessels which terminate in the median eminence. This suggests that GnRH may be released into the general circulation where It may (1) act on the ventral lobe to stimulate gon- adotropin secretion and/or (2) act direct? ly on the gonad to regulate steroid syn? thesis and secretion. In order to examine the hypothalamic control of steroid secre? tion, normal cycling female little skates, Raja erinacea were either ventral lobec- tomized or hypophysectomized and treated with GnRH. Animals were bled at intervals by caudal puncture and circulating ster? oids were determined by RIA after ether extraction. In this report we will present data on the levels of estradiol, proges? terone and testosterone in intact and operated animals after treatment with het- erologous GnRH. These data will be corre? lated with associated changes in the ovar? ian cycle and ovarian structure. Supported by NSF DCB 86-06344 to IPC 300 CHANGES IN BRAIN GNRH.

Univ. of New Hampshire, Durham, New Hampshire. Plasma levels of estradiol progesterone, and total brain GnRH were determined in relation to the reproductive state of male sea lampreys, Petromyzon marinus. during their upstream spawning migration from the sea to coastal rivers and spawning grounds. In lampreys from the natural streams, GnRH was elevated at the beginning of the sampling period and increased when the testes contained 1? and dividing 1? spermatocytes or spermatids and immature sperm. Estradiol significantly increased when the lampreys were spawning and increased when the testes contained 1? spermatocytes through spermatids or immature sperm. Progesterone levels were low or undetectable in most lampreys, however an increase was detected when the testes contained mature sperm. These data provide further evidence for the role of a hypothalamo-hypophysial-gonadal axis in adult sea lampreys.

Penny Swanson and Walton. W. Dickhoff. School of Fisheries, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 A study was conducted to evaluate the effects of exogenously administered gonadal steroids on syn? thesis and secretion of two gonadotropins (GTH I and GTH II) in sexually immature coho salmon. Fish in pre-spermatogenic or pre-vitellogenic stages of gametogenesis (body wt. 30-40 g) were given three injections of steroid (1 or 10 u.g/fish, in oil) on aiternate days. Plasma and pituitary levels of GTH i and GTH II were measured by homologous ra- dioimmunoassays (RIA). Pituitary content of GTH l was 183?24 ng/pituitary in control (noninjected) fish and was not affected by injections of oil, 17-6 estradiol(E), testosterone(T), or 11-ketotestos- terone (11-KT). Plasma GTH I levels ranged from 0.5-1.5 ng/ml and were not affected by the treat? ments. In contrast, pituitary content of GTH II was low in control animals (0.9-1.1 ng/pituitary) and was increased approximately 50-fold by E or T, and 15-fold by 11-KT injections. GTH II in plasma of all animals was below the detection limit of the RIAs (0.28 ng/ml). It was concluded that E, T, and 11 -KT have a positive feedback effect on synthesis of GTH II in juvenile coho salmon. Gonadal steroids appear to play an important role in differential regulation of synthesis/secretion of GTH I and GTH II in salmon.

Hatchling and sub-adult turtles were injected with steroids or anti-steroids for 4-6 weeks, and in vitro pituitary gonadotropin secretion was studied using a static culture system. Glandular content and secreted hormone were measured by RIA. Injections of 0.5 and 5.0 /ig/day 17-/? estradiol (E2) significantly inhibited basal and gonadotropin releasing hormone (100 ng/ml salmon GnRH)- stimulated pituitary LH secretion and gland content. E2 at 0.05 /tg had no effect. Doses of testosterone (T) ranging from 0.1 to 10 /ig/day were also inhibitory, but T was less effective than E2. An anti-estrogen, tamoxifen (TAM), and an anti- androgen, cyproterone acetate (CPA), also tended to decrease basal and GnRH-stimulated pituitary LH secretion and gland content. The results suggest that gonadal steroids inhibit pituitary LH synthesis and secretion in turtles, and that TAM and CPA may act as steroid agonist rather than antagonist in this system. Results of preliminary in vitro experiments indicate that both E2 and T can act directly on the pituitary to inhibit LH secretion in turtles.

Two social groups of sexually mature males of Oreochromis mossam- bicus were maintained. In one group, males were bachelor housed for one month while the other group of males were housed with females. Sacrif ices occured as soon as the non-courting males appeared female-like or after the courting males built a spawning pit. Minced testes of courting and non-courting males were initially incubated with various doses of prolactin (tPRL17? and tPRL18Q or an equimolar ratio) for 10 hrs. At the end of this period the medium was exchanged for fresh medium cont? aining 0.25-4*g ovine LH (oLH) and incubated for an additional 6 hrs. Radioimmunoassays were performed on both batches of medium for testost? erone (T~). The results indicate that tPRL(s) are stimulatory for T2 production by themselves in courting males, but have little or no effect in non-courting males. The effect of tPRL(s) on oLH-stimulated T2 prod? uction is stimulatory in courting males and inhibitory in non-court? ing males. 304 PARTIAL PURIFICATION OF TESTIS ECDYSIOTROPIN FROM BRAINS OF LEPIDOPTERA.

Acid methanol extracts of brains of either tobacco budworm or gypsy moth pupae will induce testes of either species to secrete ecdy? steroid jji vitro. Assays use testes of early last instar animals which do not secrete ecdysteroid in the absence of testis ecdysiotropin (TE). TE in crude extracts is freeze-thaw, heat and trypsin-labile. Size exclusion HPLC produced bioactive peaks (approx. 12, 6, and 2 KD). The 2 KD active material is much smaller than weights reported for lepidopteran PTTH or EDNH. Separ? ation of the "2 KDM fraction from an extract of 1500 gypsy moth brains by reverse-phase HPLC elicited several UV-detectable peaks that were bioactive. Further purification of the most active of these peaks is in progress.</page><page sequence="56">56A American Society of Zoologists 305 ECDYSTEROID-INDUCED EFFECTS IN CRUSTACEAN LONG-TERM PRIMARY CELL CULTURES. M.D. Brodv* and E.S. Chang. Univ. of California, Bodega Marine Laboratory, Bodega Bay. Crustacean cell cultures were developed to resolve the influence of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20- HE) on specific tissues. Long-term main? tenance of lobster, Homarus americanus and crayfish, Pacifasticus leniusculus primary cell cultures at 15? and 20?C respectively, succeeded in a modified Medium 199 (pH 7.5) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Added NaCl adjusted the lobster culture medium to 1000 mOsm and the crayfish medium to 400 mOsm. Proline and MgCl2 concentrations were also elevated. Testes were disaggregated with 200 U/l type II collagenase 2-3 days prior to culture. Hemopoietic cells have been maintained in cul? ture for three months. Lobster and crayfish testes tissues have been maintained in culture for 11 and 15 months respectively. Lobster hemocytes reacted to 10"7M 20-HE by reducing contact inhibition and increasing invasive behavior one week after hormonal exposure. The presence of 10"7M 20-HE caused mesodermal cell death and spermatogonial proliferation in testes cell cultures within one week. Crayfish testicular mesodermal cells formed vacuoles 5 days after exposure to 10*8M 20-HE. These results provide evidence that ecdysteroids directly effect crustacean cells and that the in vitro tissue responses approximate events that occur in premolt. 306 EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SALINITY ON CAUDAL NEUROSECRETORY SYSTEM IMMUNO- STAINING. B.A. Larson and Z. Madani*. Wichita State Univ., Wichita, Kansas. The function of the fish caudal neurosecretory system is uncertain but a role in osmoregulation is likely. Our objective was to determine if acclimation to different salinity has an effect on immunostaining patterns for the two caudal neuropeptides, urotensins I (Ul) and II (UII), in Gillichthys mirabilis. Fish were acclimated for 24 hrs. to deionized fresh water (FW) or seawater (SW). Spinal cords were simultaneously processed for both peptides using a double sequential immunofluorescence method. SW and FW spinal cords were paired in blocks. FW spinal cords exhibited higher staining intensity for both Ul and UII in the urophysis (a neurohemal organ) . The difference appeared greater for Ul than for UII. It appears that environmental salinity has an affect on the urophysial content of Ul and UII. This difference could reflect increased synthesis and storage or decreased release of the stored peptides in FW fish. (Thanks to Prof. H. Bern, Dr. R. Nishioka and R. Lin, Dr. D.

University of California at Berkeley. Prolactin (PRL) secretion in salmonids is considered unresponsive to in vitro changes in osmotic pressure (OP), unlike in other euryhaline teleosts. Using a 20-hour static incubation system, 3!&gt;S- methionine and SDS-PAGE, total and newly- synthesized (^s-)pRL secretion was measured in coho salmon hemipituitaries in vitro. In hemipituitaries from 2-year- old FW coho, OP differences did not alter total PRL secretion, but 35S-PRL secretion increased 50% in hypoosmotic medium. FW smolt hemipituitaries, however, showed a small but significant increase (20%) in total PRL secretion in hypoosmotic medium, which correlated with high PRL content and synthesis. To investigate possible smoltification-related changes, hemi? pituitaries were tested during smoltifica? tion in the spring of 1988. PRL synthetic activity was diminished in early April when levels of plasma cortisol are known to increase (Young et al., submitted). Preliminary data indicate that cortisol inhibits 3*S-PRL secretion in vitro. These results suggest that coho PRL secretion may be controlled by smoltification- related factors. (Aided by Calif.

Juvenile coho salmon ((frradiynchus kisutch) were placed on five dietary regimes: fed 7 days, fasted 7 days, fed 21 days, fasted 21 days, fasted 14 days/ refed 7 days. Plasma levels of glucose, fatty acids, insulin, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide (GLP) and the activities of key metabolic en2ymes were deter? mined. Plasma glucose in the fasted 7 days group was significantly elevated. Animals fasted 21 days or fasted 14 days/refed 7 days displayed plasma glucose levels similar to those of fed animals. Liver glycogen content reflected changes in plasma glucose. Fasted groups possessed significantly less glycogen than fed or fasted/refed groups. Plasma fatty acids were elevated only after 21 days of fasting; this response was reflected in elevated liver lipase activity. No alterations in liver lipogenesls, assessed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, were observed. Plasma insulin levels were hio)iest 1n fed groups and were significantly depressed in fasted groups. Plasma levels of glucagon and GLP were also depressed 1n fasted groups. These results indicate that insulin, glucagon and GLP interact with enzyre systems to nodulate energy metabolism of fish.

D.E. English, S.M. Russell and CS. Nicoll, University of California, Berkeley. We determined that the liver of repre- sentatives of the major vertebrate classes secretes synlactin, a prolactin synergist. We investigated whether syn? lactin has a role in promoting lobulo- alveolar (L-A) development in rats. Six- week-old virgin females were ovariecto- mized and catheters attached to osmotic minipumps were inserted into either the jugular or hepatic portal vein. Thus, they received chronic infusion of sol- vent or 20 ug oPRL in four 2-hr pulses/ day for 14 days. Two days after cathe- terization, they were hypophysectomized. For the next 11 days, they received in? jections of estrogen (2 ug/day), proges? terone (5 mg/day), and oGH (100 ug/day). On day 14, they were killed and their mammary glands were excised for subse? quent whole mount preparation. The degree of L-A development was rated on a scale of 0-5. Only oPRL infusion into the hepatic portal vein caused a signifi? cant increase in L-A development. Con? sistent with the synlactin hypothesis, these data indicate that prolactin can promote growth of the mammary L-A sys? tem via an hepatic action. 310 GROWTH INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF THE INTERNAL MILIEU OF PREGNANT AND LACTATING RATS. M. Chiang*, S. Russell, L. Liu and C. Nicoll. Univ. of California, Berkeley. The growth promoting properties of the internal milieu of pregnant and lactating rats were investigated using transplanted rat embryos or fetal paws. When placed under the kidney capsule of intact vir? gin hosts, the transplants grew rapidly and differentiated normally. Transplant growth in hosts during days 0-12 of preg? nancy was similar to that observed in control hosts. However, growth of trans? plants in hosts during days 10-22 of pregnancy and days 1-13 or 11-23 of lac? tation was inhibited by 20-50%. Maternal skeletal growth of late pregnant and lac? tating rats was also reduced by 40% when compared to virgins. Serum IGF-I levels in early pregnant rats were not different from those in virgins, but a significant decrease was observed in late pregnancy. Injections of porcine GH into late preg? nant and early lactating rats overcame the growth inhibition. The growth in? hibitory effect of the internal milieu of late pregnancy and lactation would spare nutrients for fetal growth and for milk synthesis. The possibility that GH re- sistence is responsible for the growth inhibition is being investigated. 311 ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE IMPLICATING LOWERED CALCIUM AND REDUCED INOSITOL PHOSPHO- LIPID TURNOVER IN PROLACTIN ACTION. R.H. Ibrahim. Univ. of Denver, Published data (Ibrahim and Platt, 1988) have indicated that the enhancement of or- nithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity in salamander liver slices by prolactin (PRL) may be mediated by a mechanism that invol? ves lowered intracellular Ca2+ and inhibi? tion of inositol phospholipid turnover. This work has been extended with the foll? owing results: 1) the effect of PRL on ODC occurs in strips of tail skin; 2) ovine growth hormone stimulates ODC in liver, but not in tail skin; 3) oxytocin blocks PRL action in skin; 4) the calcium chann? el blocker, verapamil, mimicks PRL action in skin and has an additive effect with PRL at higher concentrations; 5) neither EDTA nor nifedipine affects PRL action; 6) 0.1 mM Ca2+ inhibits PRL action in skin and liver; 7) gossypol, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, mimicks PRL action in skin and liver; and 8) Li+, an inhibitor of inositol phosphatase, blocks PRL action in liver. Preliminary results using gas chromatography suggest that Li+ causes the accumulation of inositol and inositol phos- phates in liver homogenates and PRL blocks the accumulation of these compounds. 312 THE MECHANISM OF PROLACTIN ACTION: AN ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS. J.E.Platt. Univ. of Denver. We have previously provided data sug? gesting that the enhancement of ornithine decarboxylase activity in amphibian tis? sues by prolactin (PRL) may be mediated by a mechanism which lowers intracellular Ca2+, perhaps via an inhibition of inosi? tol phospholipid turnover. Direct sup? port for a relationship between reduced cellular Ca2+ and PRL action has been ob? tained using the fluorescent Ca2+ probe, quin 2. Isolated salamander hepatocytes were loaded with quin 2 AM and then incu? bated for 2 hr with or without PRL. The cells incubated with PRL had a signifi? cantly lower quin 2 fluorescent signal than the control cells, indicating a low? er intracellular concentration of free Ca2+. However, a survey of recently- published data regarding the relationship between PRL action and the Ca2+-inositol phospholipid pathway suggests that this second messenger system will not necess? arily provide the long-awaited "common denominator" of PRL actions. We believe that the alternative hypothesis that PRL binding may not generate a second messen? ger deserves serious consideration. Poss? ible iraplications of this hypothesis will be analyzed.</page><page sequence="58">58A American Society of Zoologists 313 BACTERIA-DEPENDENT DEIODINATION OF 3,5,3'-TRIIODOTHYRONINE (T3) IN RAT FECAL HOMOGENATE. A. C. de Luze, E. Kim , T. T. Nguven , J. J. DiStefano. III (in- tro. by N. L. Collie) Biocybernetics Laboratory, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA It is clear that intestinal bacteria are involved in the deconjugation of thyroid hormone (T3 and T4) conjugates in gut, the predominant forms secreted in bile. We are exploring other possible roles for intestinal bacteria in thyroid hormone metabolism, in this study the deiodination of T3. Fresh collec? tions of feces were pooled for each of 2 rat groups, 4 controls (C) and 4 (partially) bacteria- decontaminated (BD) in 1 week of oral antibiotic treatment. Homogenates of each pool were incu? bated for 2h and 24h at 37C with 125I-T3 (T3), and extracts were chromatographed to assess metabolite formation. The major result was that radioiodide formation at 24h was 21.4 ? 3.15% (CV%) in controls but only 4.08 ? 2.11% in BD rats. Intermediate deiodination products were also found. There appears to be substantial deiodina? tion of T3 by microflora resident in gut. 314 ULTRASTRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF HEMOCYTES FROM DISEASED CLAMS (MYA ARENARIA)FROU NEW BEDFORD HARBOR, MA. M.P. Morse. Mar. Sci. Center and Bio. Dept., Northeastern Univ., Nahant, MA. A disease of hemocytes, described in several bivalve species, has been well documented and characterized with light microscopy in Mya arenaria from a known polluted site, New Bedford Harbor. Little has been reported, beyond the light microscope level of the cellular pathology. Ten clams with greater than 75% infection were screened with light microscopy and the hemocytes fixed for electron microscopy. Diseased hemocytes form a relatively homogeneous population of cells with dense cytoplasm; some variation of fine granular inclusions in the cytoplasm is seen. Noticably absent are lysosomal bodies or evidence of particulate uptake by the cells. Diseased hemocytes were found encapsulated by normal hemocytes. Numerous changes are associated with the surface of the enlarged nucleus and are under study to determine if the structures visible are pathological changes associated with nuclear pores, or virus-like particles. Possible stages of the diseased hemocytes in a cell cycle are discussed.

Center and Blo. Dept., Northeastern Univ., Nahant, Ma. Preliminary screening of blood samples of soft-shelled clams {Mya arenaria) collected from New Bedford Harbor, Ma. allowed separation into organisms with greater than 75% of their blood cells exhibiting a disease (sometimes called hematopoietic neoplasia) from those with normal- appearing blood cells. Phagocytic activity (recognition, adherence, uptake and degradation) in normal and diseased hemocytes was measured after in vitro incubation with yeast. Both diseased and normal hemocytes stain with Con A indicating presence of receptors capable of recognizing foreign particles. Examination of diseased hemocytes with SEM indicated that yeast did not adhere to the surface, and with the light microscope, that yeast cells had not been ingested; however, histochemical studies showed higher than normal acid phosphatase and non-specific esterase activity. These results suggest that phagocytosis is interrupted between the recognition and degradation stages.

CA.Moore, Lesley College, Cambridge, MA, N.Beckmann and M.P. Morse, Mar. Sci.Center, Northeastern Univ., Biol. Dept., Nahant, MA One of the functions of molluscan hemo? cytes in the overall defense of the animal is phagocytosing foreign material. When this phagocytic ability is impaired the animal becomes vulnerable to physiological disruption by foreign agents. As in other bivalves, hemocytes of Mya arenaria have been shown to phagocytose a variety of foreign substances and to possess the hy? drolytic enzymes necessary to degrade in- corporated materials. However, diseased hemocytes demonstrate no phagocytic capa- bilities. These hemocytes generally do not attach to glass and remain rounded, ex- tending few, if any, short filopods. Whole cell EM preparations of hemocytes from diseased animals indicate an altered cyto- skeletal structure as compared to normal cells. Hemocyte preparations incubated in rhodamine labeled phalloidin and observed with fluorescent microscopy demonstrate altered actin filament patterns in dis? eased hemocytes. The disrupted cytoskele- tal structure observed in diseased hemo? cytes may account for the lack of phago? cytic ability.

Millham and T.G. Pistole. Univ. of New Hampshire, Durham. The internal defenses of the American horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus. are thought to involve circulating blood cells or amebocytes, and at least two lectins. This study investigates potential relationships between amebocytes and one of the lectins, polyphemin. Polyphemin was purified from whole serum on an affinity chromatography system using N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) as ligand, and eluted with a linear gradient of GlcNAc. Three distinct fractions could be obtained using this sytem; the fraction eluting first from the column contained the lectin. The lectin was futher characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration. Antiserum to the lectin raised in rabbits was shown to be reactive with washed, viable monolayers of amebocytes by immunoperoxidase assays. Western blot analysis of solubilized cells revealed that cell-associated lectin is present in a form different from that of free lectin, suggesting that it is covalently associated with cell structures. These results indicate a role for polyphemin as an opsonin and/or cell-bound receptor for pathogens. 318 HOMOLOGOUS AND HETEROLOGOUS ANTIBODIES EXHIBIT DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS FOR ACTIVATION OF CHICKEN COMPLEMENT. T.L. Koppenheffer. Trinity Univ., San Antonio. Chicken anti-sheep erythrocyte (SRBC) antisera, and IgM and IgG fractions obtained therefrom, were used to investigate the nature of antibody- dependent activation of chicken comple? ment. In contrast to activation by mammalian antibodies, chicken complement is activated by chicken antisera and antibody isolates in the absence of Ca^+. Carrageenan, an inhibitor of mam? malian Cl, decreases the hemolytic acti? vity of chicken complement when tested with SRBC sensitized by rabbit antibo? dies, but has only a minimal inhibitory effect when added to complement and tested against SRBC sensitized with chicken antibodies or horse erythrocy- tes, a known activator of the chicken alternative complement pathway. At the same time, SRBC sensitized with either rabbit or chicken antibodies were lysed when added to a mixture of guinea pig serum depleted of Cl and non-hemolytic dilutions of chicken serum. Taken together, this information suggests that chicken antibodies activate the alternative complement pathway, even though chicken serum possesses a com? ponent with Cl-like activity. 319 REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN HEMATOPOIETIC POTENTIAL WITHIN THE XENOPUS VENTRAL BLOOD ISLANDS. Paula JL Smith and James IL Turpen. University of Nebraska Medical Center, Cmaha 68105. Regional differences in the frequencies and potentialities of hematopoietic stem cells from 20 hour old Xenopus embryos were examined by trans- planting limiting numbers of cytogenet- ically labeled mesodermal cells into different regions of the ventral blood islands. When 1/8 VBI, a dose of tissue previously shown to contain a maximum of one stem cell, was placed centrally within the VBI, engraftment of the erythroid population only was observed in 62% of the animals and erythroid plus lymphoid engraftment was seen in 38%. On the other hand, when this tissue was placed peripherally within the VBI, erythroid only engraftment fell to 35% and erythroid plus lymphoid engraftment rose to 45%. Significantly, 18% of the animals in which the tissue was positioned peripherally exhibited lymphoid engraftment in the complete absence of erythroid engraftment. These data are consistent with an interpretation of distinct microenviro- ments within the VBI, which functions either by exclusion or inclusion. 320 THYMXYTE SUCCESSICN DURING LARVAL DEVELOPMENT IN XENOPUS. James IL. Turpen and Paula IL Smith. University of Nebraska Medical Center, Cmaha 68105. Cellular turnover within the develop? ing thymus was examined by transplanting cytogenetically distinct thymic lobes between MHC compatible larvae at different stages during development. Based on the flow cytametric analysis of cytogeneti? cally distinct thymocytes, there were at least two periods of stem cell immigration into the organ. The first entry occurred prior to day 20. Within the thymus, cohorts of cells derived from this first wave expanded at different times. The initial expansion of thymocytes occurred prior to 35 days. Cells involved in a second period of expansion occurring after 35 days were also derived frcm the initial immigrants and resulted in the complete turnover of thymocytes during the larval period. A new wave of precursor cells also entered the thymus during metamor? phosis, subsequently expanded and resulted in an additional turnover of thymocytes. These data demonstrated that there was a succession of cells within the Xenopus thymus. Each thymocyte cohort appeared to have been clonally derived from different stem cells.</page><page sequence="60">60A American Society of Zoologists 321 SUCCESSION OF LECTIN-REACTIVE T CELL COHORTS DURING LARVAL DEVELOPMENT IN XENOPUS. Thomas E. Bechtold and James B. Turpen. University of Nebraska Medical Center, Qmaha 68105. The larval thymic rudiitient is engraf ted with lymphoid progenitors associated with either ventral or dorsal lateral plate mesoderm. We have asked, "Do both the ventral and dorsal stem cell ccmpartments contribute to the functional, peripheral, T cell pool during early development?". Triploid Xenopus neurula were engraf ted with stage-matched diploid mesoderm. Functional T cells were operationally defined by invitro activation of spleen cells with thymus dependent mitogens. The proportion of graft derived responders was determined by quantitation of Feulgen stained DNA in demecolcine arrested metaphase plates. Both compartments were shown to contribute to lectin reactive populations in the larval spleen in proportion to their contribution to expanding thymic cohorts. It was concluded that ventral and dorsal derived lymphoid progenitors do not differ in their potential to contribute to the first and second waves of larval thymocyte expansion, and that ventral derived T cells may persist beyond metamorphosis. 322 QUANTTTAIWE ULTRASTRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES IN AEROBIC MUSCLE FROM TWO ANTARCTIC FISHES, TREMATOMUS NEWNESI AND NOTOTHENIA GIBBERIFRONS. R.L.Londraville. Univ. of Maine, Orono. Aerobic capacities of oxidative musde from two ecotypically dissimilar species of Antarctic nsn were compared by quantifying relevant ultrastructural features using stereological analyses of electron micrographs. Trematomus newnesi is an active pelagic species, and has a higher volume percentage of mitochondria (indicating a nigher aerobic capadty) than the sluggish bottom dweller Notothenia gibberifrons (Vv(mit)=.35?.02; .25+..007 respectively, P&lt;.001). However, the capillary density of T. newnesi is lower than that of N. gibberifrons (NA(c,f)=296?30; 438+9, respectively, P&lt;.02) with no significant difference in capillary boundary length (fJ,c) or capillary cross- sectional area (a",c). These data suggest a lower oxygen delivery per mitochondrion in T. newnesi. The apparent paradox may be explained by the higher volume density of lipid (Vv(hp)) in T. newnesi than N. gibberifrons (.026?_.002; .012+..004 respectively, P&lt;.01). Because oxygen is &gt;4X more soluble in lipid than in aqueous cytosol, we suggest that lipid is fadlitating oxyeen transport from capillaries to mitochondria deep within the muscle fiber in fishes with a relatively low capillary density and a hieh volume density of lipid.

New Mexico State University, Las Cruces. Leukotrienes (LTs) have been shown to cause contractions of mammalian airway smooth muscle. In this study, LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4 were tested on isolated strips of bullfrog lung. LTC4, LTD4f and LTE4 (10"7M to 3 x 10_T0M) stimulated lung contraction. LTC4 was the most potent, with LTD4 and LTE4 being of equal but lower potency. In addition, the effects of three mammalian LTD4 receptor antagonists, L-649,923, L-648,051 and LY171883 were tested. AH three antagonists failed to block LTC4- stimulated contractions, but were effective blockers of LTD4. LTE4-stimulated contractions were significantly blunted by all three antagonists, but the extent of blockade was less than for LTD4. Significant bioconversion of 14C-LTC4 to LTD4 and LTE4 occurred in minced lung preparations but not in lung strips. Peptido-leukotrienes cause contraction in amphibian lung, though the order of potency differs from mammals. Like mammals, frogs appear to have two classes of leukotriene receptors, one for LTC4 and one for LTD4/LTE4.

Childress. Univ. of Calif., Santa Barbara, and Scripps Inst. Oceanography. Sj_ reidi., a gutless clam that lives in burrows in the L.A. sewage outfall, contains symbiotic, sulfide-oxidizing bacteria in its' gills. It has been previously shown that the oxidation of sulfide by intact clams is coupled with net C02 uptake (i.e., carbon auto- trophy). Though sulfide oxidation was found to be oxygen dependent, the metabolic poise of the animal tissues was not known. The highest rates of 02 consumption occurred during incubations in 100 uM sulfide and declined at greater concentrations. Symbiont-free foot tissue from clams incubated in various levels of sulfide (50-500 uM), aerated seawater, and deoxygenated seawater were analyzed for anaerobic substrates and products and compared. It was found that aerobic metabolism is maintained in these tissues in the presence of up to 100 uM sulfide; however, in 500 uM sulfide anaerobic metabolism is evident. The metabolic flexibility of this species is clearly advantageous in its' low oxygen, toxic, sulfide-rich habitat.</page><page sequence="61">ABSTRACTS 61A 325 OXYGEN AND SULFIDE BINDING BY CLAM HEMOGLOBINS: A DIVISION OF LABOR. J2JAL Kraus and J.B. Wittenberg*. A. Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, N.Y. Three distinct cytoplasmic hemoalobins have been isolatecf from the gills of Lucina pectinata. a bivalve mollusc with symbiotic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria in its gills. All three hemogbbins have nearly the same oxygen affinity (P50 ? 0.2 torr), yet one hemoglobin, Hb I, dissociates oxygen 700 times faster than Hb II and Hb III. At an oxygen pressure about 2 torr just sufficient to 95% saturate the hemoglobin, Hb II and Hb III remain oxygenated when hydrogen sulfide (0.2 torr) is introduced into the gas mixture. Under these conditions, Hb I rapidly binds sulfide to form ferric hemoglobin sulfide (ferric hemoglobin with a sulfide anion ligated to the heme iron), probably with ferric hb as an intermediate reactant. When oxidized to the ferric state, Hb I binds sulfide nearly one million times faster than Hb II and Hb II) at pH 7.5. Thus, either in the partially oxygenated state or in the ferric state, Mb I readily reacts with sulfide while Hbs II and III are refractory. We suggest that Hb I functions to deliver sulfide and Hbs II and III function to deliver oxygen in the symbiont-containing gill of Lucina pectinata. Supported by N.S.F.

Two co-occurring hemoglobins (Hbs) were isolated from the body fluids of the hydrothermal vent tubeworm Riftia pachyptila and their oxygenation prop? erties were determined with a thin layer technique. Both have high O2 affinities but differ in their oxygenation proper? ties. FI, the larger MW Hb (1,700,000), has the lower O2 affinity, a large pH Bohr effect, and high cooperativity. FII, the smaller MW Hb (400,000), has a higher O2 affinity, no pH Bohr effect, and low cooperativity. The vascular blood contains a mixture of the two Hbs and is adapted for O2 uptake and trans? port to internal symbionts and metabo- lizing tissues. The coelomic fluid contains exclusively the smaller MW fraction FII, and is adapted for O2 uptake from the vascular blood and for O2 storage. These differences in oxygen? ation properties and distribution of the two Hbs allow them to play different physiological roles for the animal in situ and are reminiscent of other animal systems which utilize co-occurring Hbs to establish an O2 transfer network from respiratory tissues to metabolizing tissues in an O2 limited environment. 327 FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF THE HEMOCYANINS OF SOME PELAGIC, MIDWATER CRUSTACEANS. N. K. Sanders and J.J. Childress. Univ. of Calif., Santa Barbara. The oxygen binding characteristics of hemocyanins from the hemolymphs of vertically migrating and non-migrating pelagic midwater crustaceans were examined with respect to temperature and pH. Among the non-migrating mysid and deep living oplophorid shrimps we examined, the hemocyanin oxygen affinity is temperature independent. Conversely, in vertical migrators the hemocyanin oxygen affinity is reduced at higher temperatures. Hemocyanin concentrations were relatively low in all the midwater crustaceans examined, but the highest hemocyanin levels were found in the hemolymphs of the vertical migrators. Some of these midwater crustaceans were held at various temperatures (5 - 25?C) for four hours; the pH and L-lactate concentrations in the hemolymph were then measured. Hemolymph pH decreased with increasing maintenance temperature in both non-migrators and in vertical migrators. Hemolymph L-lactate concentrations were similar to those measured in other crustacean species; L-lactate concentrations did not appear to be related to maintenance temperature. These characteristics were examined in relation to the midwater environment. 328 HEMOGLOBIN IN A WHALE LOUSE, CYAMUS SCAMMONI (AMPHIPODA) N.B. TerwilliQer and R.C. TerwilUger. Oregon Inst.

The cyamid Cyjumis. scammoni, an epizoic amphipod found only on the gray whale* Eschrichtius robustus, has a red fluid in its hemolymph* spiral gills and oostegites and a pink body color. The redness is due to an extracellular high molecular weight hemoglobin (Hb)* a surprising finding considering that amphipods and isopods studied previously contain hemocyanin as their respiratory protein. The hemolymph chromatographs as three heme containing peaks on Biogel A-5m with mol. wts. of about 2 million* 1.1 million* and 500,000. TEM of negatively stained Hb shows a chevron shaped molecule. The subunit mol. wt. is about 110,000 as determined by SDS PAGE. Limited proteolysis of the Hb results in 30*000 and 60*000 mol. wt. components; thus the subunit is probably composed of covalently linked functional units as has been demonstrated in anostracan crustacean Hbs. Oxygen binding studies show that the Hb has a P50 of 14 - 24 Torr between pH 7.0 and 7.9* a positive Bohr effect* and cooperativity* nH = 1.5.

Blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus, exposed to an ambient Po2 of 50 mmHg for 7- 25 da. exhibit a decline in arterial P02 from near 100 nmHg to 12- 22 mmHg. Unlike results of previous reports in the literature, there was no alkalosis and hemolymph pH, in fact, remained stable throughout hypoxia. Total CO- increased approximatley twofold and, following 7 da. exposure, had not fully recovered in 24 h. Hemolymph lactate increased by less than 1 mM, but this increase was, nonetheless, significant. The lack of an alkalosis is explained by an offsetting metabolic acid? osis from the production of lactic acid. Electron micrographs indicate that 20 da. hypoxic exposure is acccmpanied by a dra- matic reduetion in the number and size of mitochondria in leg muscle. Initial data indicate that oxygen uptake is depressed during 14 da. or long- er exposure and is not restored within 24 h of return to normoxia. Crabs exposed to such conditions are clearly able to make adjustments, but these are so extreme as to limit normal activities during and following hypoxia.

WLUian &amp; Mary, Williarasburg, Va. and George Mason Univ., Fairfax, Va. Exposure of blue crabs to water POa 50 nm Hg did not, in the present experiment, result in a blood pH or lactate increase that would have resulted in turn in an adaptive increase in HcOa affinity. After 25 (but not 7) da., hypoxia did raise blood Ca 3 and urate, also allosteric modulators that in-* crease HcOa affinity. In addition the relative concentrations of 3 of the 6 different monomeric subunits of the molecule shifted, with an attendant intrinsic increase in HcOa affinity. Specifically, subunits 3, 5 and 6, two of which also respond to changes in salinity and the 3rd already known to be labile in response to unknown factors, decrease in concentration. Ihe change in P? (but not coopera? tivity or pH sensitivity) is significant at 7 da. and becomes large at 25 da. Ihe acclimation may be expedited by a large increase in Hc concentration at 25 (but not 7) da., perhaps reflecting select? ive Hc synthesis. Ihe net result is a 30-40 % change in intrinsic 0a affinity at physiological pH, which must be raised further by the exogenous effectors. We conclude that alteration of subunit composition is a mechanism of adaptation to hypoxia as well as salinity. 331 INVERTEBRATE MODELS OF REOXYGENATION INJURY IMPLICATE FAILURE OF OXIDATIVE DEFENSES. J.A.Dykens, Grinnell College, Grirmell, Iowa. Mammalian reoxygenation tissue damage (RTD) is reportedly due to ischemia- induced conversion of xanthine dehydro? genase (XDH) into xanthine oxidase (XO) which generates cytotoxic superoxide radicals (02~) during reperfusion. Intertidal invertebrates (e.g., Mytilus edulis) that tolerate envi ronmentally- imposed hypoxia-reoxygenation due to tidal flux, apparently avoid RTD by reducing metabolic rate during hypoxia thereby retaining adenylates, and also by having XDH which is resistant to XO conversion. Conversely, Placopecten magellanicus, an aerobically poised sub? tidal scallop which survives 48hr hypoxia but dies during subsequent 24hr reoxygen? ation, undergoes adenylate depletion during hypoxia, and also has XO activity. However, O2" flux from XO appears inadequate to account solely for either scallop or mammalian RTD. Rather, 0?" cytotoxicity is apparently exacerbated by failure of oxidative defenses; scallop superoxide dismutase activity in gill and hepatopancreas is reduced 58% and 76% respectively during reoxygenation.

L.S.Ouackenbush. Florida Inter. Univ. Miami. Eyestalk ablation induces ovarian development in penaeid shrimp. Egg yolk proteins from the ovaries of mature JL* vannamei were isolated and characterized. A polyclonal antibody to these egg yolk proteins was produced and characterized. Egg yolk production was measured with this antibody in an in vitro assay. Protein synthesis was low in isolated tissues from intact animals. Seven days after eyestalk ablation , protein synthesis increased by more than three fold in ovaries and hepatopancreas. Incorporation of leucine into proteins declined over time, reaching pre-ablation levels in 21 days. The egg yolk protein content of the ovaries reached a maximum 21 days after eyestalk ablation. Egg yolk protein content of the hepatopancreas initially increased but declined to pre-ablation levels by 21 days post-ablation. These studies show that the most active egg yolk protein production occurs during the first two weeks after eyestalk ablation.

Brian Tsuktmura and Fred Lu Kaaemoto. University of Hawaii, Honolulu. The mandibular organ secretes both terpenoids and steroids, which were assayed in vitro to determine their effect on growth of oocytes. Pieces of adult immature ovary were cultured in Medium 199 (salts adjusted to Homarus saline) and one hormone (progesterone, 17a-hydroxyprogesterone, 170-estradiol, I7a,20^-dihydroxyprogesterone, methyl farnesoate [MF} or juvenile hormone III [JH]) with final concentrations of 1 pM, 10 pM, 100 pM, 1 nM, 10 nM and 100 nM, at 20?C and agitated at 50-60 rpm on a rotary shaker. Six pm histological sections were examined under light micro? scopy and oocytes exceding 40 pm in diameter were recorded. Of the four steroids assayed, only 17a-hydroxyproges- terone significantly increased oocyte diameters (at all concentrations). Both terpenoids, MF and JH, significantly Increased oocyte diameters. These data suggest that these secretions of the mandibular organ are capable of stimualting oocyte growth in vitro.

The site of control for hatching time of eggs was investigated in Sesarma cinereum, Uca pugilator and Neopanope sayi, which occupy supralittoral, litto? ral and sublittoral habitats respectively. Hatching time was monitored for eggs attached to females and for eggs removed several hours prior to eclosion. Results show that for all species, hatching time of removed and attached eggs was not ran? dom, The mean hatching time of removed eggs was, however, significantly later than that of attached eggs of j&gt;. cinereum and JJ. pugilator, though not for N. sayi. The percentage of eggs which hatched into viable larvae was also much lower for removed than for attached eggs of J3. cinereum and JJ. pugilator, but there was no difference for JS. sayi. These data suggest that the final stages of embryo development and eclosion can occur "independent of the female in all three species. For the more terrestrial crabs, jS. cinereum and JJ. pugilator, chemicals released by the female near the time of larval release may be important for the timing and success of egg- hatching. 335 VARIABLES AFFECTING HATCHING TIME OF ALASKAN RED KING CRAB. T. C. Shirley and s. M. Shirley. Univ. of Alaska Fairbanks, Juneau. A bimodal pattern of seasonal density of first stage zoeae fParalithodes camtschatica) quanti- fied from 5 replicate plankton samples (1.0 m2 NIO net) collected weekly for 4 years provides in situ evidence that groups of crabs release larvae at different times and that temperature affects hatch? ing time. Larval release time of crabs held at ambient light and water temperature was significantly related to size of brooding female, with eggs of primiparous females hatching before those of multipar- ous females. Molting, mating and egg extrusion of primiparous fe? males are not delayed by incubation of a prior clutch. In related experiments, a highly significant direct relationship (r2=0.99) ex? isted between degree-days required for hatching and incubation temper? ature for crabs at 12, 9, 6, 3 and 0 C. Incubation time decreased 25% between crabs at 3 and 6 C, temper? atures near the annual mean, but only a 10% decrease occurred be? tween crabs at 6 and 12 C.

Univ. of Alaska Fairbanks, Juneau. King crab larvae (Paralithodes camt- schatica) were sampled with 5 plankton tows (1 m2 NIO net) weekly from March to June, 1985-88. Interannual variation existed in time of hatch, length of lar? val period, larval density and survival and synchrony with the spring phytoplank? ton bloom. Hatching occurred earlier and larval period was longer in years with warmer water temperatures. Larval period ranged from 50 d (1985) to 113 d (1988). Maximum larval density varied from 10 (1988) to 40*100 m3 (1987). Survival from 1st zoea to glaucothoe, estimated by instar analysis, ranged from 0.7% (1986) to 2.9% (1988). Hatch? ing coincided with the bloom in 1985 and 1987, but not in 1986 or 1988. Though early zoeae are thought to depend on phy? toplankton, synchrony of hatching with the bloom was not related to larval survival. Survival also was not related to total primary production, density of barnacle nauplii (as potential food) or length of the larval period.

C. C. Brodersen. M. M. Babcock. P. A. Rounds*. and P. J. Arasmith*. NMFS Auke Bay Laboratory, AK. Red king crabs (Paralithodes camtschatica) are omnivorous, opportunistic feeders, and young juveniles are cannibalistic. We maintained isolated individual one-year-olds for 2 inter-molt periods (~3 mo.) on one of the following diets, ad libitum: shrimp, herring, clam, squid, a mixture of those 4 items, this mixture plus kelp, commercial shrimp-food pellets, or starvation. Shrimp and the mixed diets supported fastest growth rates (.021 gm live wt/day), the pellets supported the slowest (.006 gm/d), with the others ranged between. (Starved crabs survived but did not molt.) We then maintained groups of juvenile king crabs at different densities, with different amounts of cover and on different diets. Diet had a more significant effect on the occurrence of cannibalism than either density or cover. Thus, although it is unlikely that omnivorous king crabs often lack food in the wild, seasons offering a suboptimal variety of food items may effect growth and behavior, contributing to the wide fluctuations in red king crab recruitment.

Louisiana Univ. Marine Consortium, Univ. Southwestern Louis., and Louis. State Univ., Chauvin, LA. The larvae and postlarvae of two species of the stone crab genus Menippe were reared under a series of temperature and salinity combinations. Considerable interbrood variability in survivorship was observed in M. adina, which has consistently smaller larvae, but not in M. mercenaria. Lower survivorship was seen in M. adina compared to the latter across most salinity X temperature combinations. In reduced salinities (15 ppt), however, larvae of M. adina consistently molted to megalopae and crab I stages, while larvae of M. mercenaria did not, Overall survivorship for M. adina was highest and development rates were most rapid in 30oC, and decreased in 25oC and 20oC. Terminally additive stages were the rule in 1988 cultures rather than the exception (as in 1987 cultures) for M. adina. These morphologically unusual supernumerary stages can be attributed to no obvious stresses related to temperature, salinity, or food. Posdarval crab stages of M. adina and M. mercenaria reared in different salinities were subjected to salinity reductions. There was good survivorship in all combinations of species X crab stage X rearing history down to 5 ppt. Below this salinity, M. adina exhibited better survivorship than M. mercenaria, and survivorship in both varied with crab stage and the rearing salinity. 339 TEMPORAL VARIATION IN GROWTH OF THE SAND CRAB, EMERITA ANALOGA, FROM TWO CALIFORNIA BEACHES. J^ j^ Dugan, University of California, Santa Barbara. The indeterminate growth and short intermolt period of Emerita analoga make it an ideal species for studies of temporal and geographic patterns of crustacean growth. The field growth rates of juvenile and adult sand crabs, E. analoga, from two locations were estimated using an "instantaneous" growth rate technique. Size specific molt increments varied temporally and between locations, and were positively associated with estimates of food availability (chlorophyll a.). The largest size specific molt increments were observed in the spring and early summer at both locations, Estimates of molt frequency also varied temporally and with size, sex, and location. In general, molt increments increased with crab size to a maximum increment then decreased with crab size. Female crabs had larger molt increments than male crabs beginning in early postlarval molts. The size at which maximum molt increments occurred varied temporally and spatially. 340 A NEUROPEPTIDE WITH MOLT-INHIBITING ACTIVITY FROM THE SINUS GLAND OF THE MEXICAN CRAYFISH PROCAMBARUS BOUVIERI (ORTMANN). A. Huberman and M.B. Aguilar. Instituto Nacional de la Nutricion S. Zubir^n. Mexico Ci- ty. Mexico. By means of RP-HPLC on a u-Bon- dapak-Phenyl column, a neuropeptide was isolated from a crude extract of 2000 sinus glands. The activity was tested in a heterologous in vitro assay as the depression of ecdysteroid biosynthesis by cultur- e^ Orconectes limosusf Y-organs. The yield of MIH was 25 ng/s.g. On SDS-PAGE the peptide migrated as a single band of approx. 6000 MW. On I.E.F., MIH migrated as a single band to a pl of 5.50. The amino end was found blocked and the carboxyl end was ILE. Tryptic digestion of the peptide and partial sequence analysis has shown a striking simi? larity between the MIH and the hy- perglycemic hormones described by us in the same species. The proba? bility that these hormones belong to a closely related family of neu? ropeptides was further shown by CD studies.

PRTs were iodinated and identified on autoradiograms following IEF and 2-D PAGE. A number of small PRTs (-10-28 kDa) present in extracts of G. lateralis IM exoskeleton were either absent or present in relatively lesser amounts in exuvia indicating their degradation during proecdysis. Other PRTs (-12, 13, 32, 51, 64, 79, 84, 86, 98, 104, 113 kDa) were more abundant in exuvia than in IM exoskeleton indicating their resistance to in vivo degradation. The 64 kDa PRT, apparently an important structural component of arthropod cuticles, was present in relatively greater amounts in exuvia of all species examined; a similarly-sized crab PRT reacted with polyclonal antibodies to insect (Manduca) pupal cuticles (Stringfellow &amp; Skinner, Dev.

Costello, Col. Osteo. Med., Ohio Univ., Athens. The giant fiber pathway (GFP) mediates the startle response in adult Drosophila. Activation causes stereotyped DLM (wing depressor) response of short latency (1.4 ms,22C). At 30C, ts shi causes reversible paralysis and blockage of endocytosis. Pupal heat pulse (HP:6h,30C) induces anom- alous development. In shi flies after early to mid-pupal HP, increased DLM latency is associated with disruption of PSI, a con? tralateral interneuron in the GFP (GF-PSI- DLMn-DLM). Mosaic flies were generated by crossing wvc (ring X) females and shi males with cuticular markers. After HP of ?l at 20% pupal development, adults were screened for bilateral thoracic mosaics, and latency of GFP targets was measured. Three mosaics had wild type (WT) ventral ganglion (vg) and equal DLM latency on the two sides. Eight mosaics had bilateral shi /+ vg. The GFP to the shi side is (lower case=shi) GF/gf-PSI-dlmn-dlm and DLM laten? cy was normal; the GFP to the WT side is GF-psi-DLMn-DLM and DLM latency exceeded the shi side by 0.2-0.4ms (n=6). Thus the DLM latency via GFP in these HP mosaics reflects the genotype of the contralateral PSI.

The Trochlear (NIV) and Oculomotor (NIII) nerves in the eye orbit of S 53 Xenopus laevis tadpoles were cut to ob? serve neurite sprout patterns and muscle target selection during regeneration. The open space in the orbit allowed freely sprouting nerves to be recorded in situ over 20 days using a vital dye. Sprout preference for the Superior Oblique (SOM) was high by Day 12 (86%) if it alone were cut. If both nerves were cut, NIV's abil? ity to return to the SOM was reduced (86 to 55%) over the same period. If N III were removed providing five muscle tar? gets, NIV's return to the SOM, if com? pared to the both nerves cut group, was improved (55 to 70%); but more sprouts made contact with other available mus? cles (51%). Another group had the SOM cut, intending to remove its influence. Sprouting was observed with and with? out NIII regenerating. Unexpectedly, NIV chose the regenerating SOM more often (88-100%) than any intact mus? cle, and contacts with inappropriate muscle were almost nil. NIV's return to cut muscle was swifter and more directed than in any other test condition. 344 TRANSPORT OF A MITOGEN INTO NERVES OF A SALAMANDER FORELIMB IN RESPONSE TO AMPUTATION. Chgri* L. Winner. Dept. of Zoology, Miami University, Oxford, Ohio 45056. This study uses reamputated regenerates, which lack myelin, as a test system to separate the effects of a myelin-derived mitogen and the Neurotrophic Factor (NTF) carried by limb axons. Early 4-digit regenerates were reamputated, and some were denervated 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, or 60 hrs later. Limbs were pulse labeled with ^H-thymidine on days 2-6 post- reamputation. Innervated stumps responded with a rapid increase in mitotic (Ml) and labeling (LI) indices, and stumps denervated at time 0 showed no increase in Ml or LI. Limbs denervated 12 h after reamputation also showed no rise in LI or Ml. Cell cycle activity in limb stumps denervated 24 h after reamputation rose to near normal levels on days 2-4, then fell to near 0 on day 6. Denervation at later times allowed stump cells to proliferate at normal levels until day 6. These results demonstrate A) the lack of an axonal mitogen in limb nerves as late as 12 hours post-amputation and B) the presence of an axonal mitogen in limb nerves by 24 hours post-amputation.</page><page sequence="66">66A American Society of Zoologists 345 DEVELOPMENT THROUGH NEURULATION IN LARGE EGGS OF PLETHODONTID SALAMANDERS. A. Collazo. Univ. of California at Berkeley. The plethodontid salamander Ensatina eschscholtzii has very large eggs (7-9 mm) that develop very slowly. Neurulation does not begin until 23 days (13.5 ? C) after egg deposition. Early cleavages are meroblastic, asynchronous and divide the animal pole in a nonpredictable pattern. By about the 16 cell stage cleavage furrows extend all the way to the vegetal pole, cleaving the egg in a holoblasuc manner. The late blastula stage has the embryo divided into small cells with the vegetal pole cells being larger than those of the animal pole. The dorsal lip of the blastopore forms at the boundary of the animal and vegetal poles, below the equatorial plane, by the formation of bottle cells. The blastocoel roof is thin and during gastrulation the involuting cells appear to crawl along the roof. The closed blastopore is a slit with little yolk extruding. By the end of gastrulation, embryonic pattern formation is occurring on an embryonic disc, as seen in the frog Gastrotheca riobambae. Another plethodontid, Batrachosepsy has a smaller egg (4 mm) and more rapid development. Holoblastic cleavages occur sooner and the blastocoel roof is thicker than in Ensatina. Here gastrulauon and neurulation are similar to the typical salamander pattern. The differences between the two species are due mainly to differences in egg size and yolk amounts since smaller eggs of smaller Ensatina develop faster than larger eggs.

To study the role of bFGF in mam? malian embryogenesis, 10-day rat embryos were transplanted under both kidney cap- sules of syngeneic hosts, where they grow rapidly and differentiate in an essentially normal manner. A small branch of the right renal artery of the hosts was catheterized and antiserum to bFGF was infused into the right kidney via an osmotic pump. Transplants on the left kidney served as controls. Infusion of anti-FGF from days 1 to 6 or 4 to 13 post-transplantation inhibited growth of embryos by 25% (p&lt;0.01) and 55% (p&lt;0.001), respectively, as assessed by wet weight, protein and DNA content. Although the anti-FGF did not affect differentiation of some ectoderm-derived tissues (e.g. skin), it severely inhibit? ed differentiation of all mesoderm- and many endoderm-derived tissues in trans? planted embryos. Intrarenal infusion of recombinant bovine bFGF stimulated growth of the embryos over 6 days by 50%. FGF may be involved in regulation of growth and tissue differentiation of rat embryos. Its effects may be both direct and indirect, and may involve interactions with other growth factors. 347 CHARACTERIZATION OF EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX CELL ADHESION MOLECULES IN SPONGES. J.A.Varner. Univ. of Basel, Switzerland. Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins which are high affinity cell surface bound ligands for the sponge Microciona prolifera cell adhesion proteoglycan, Aggregation Factor (MAF), were identified using iodinated MAF as a probe in a Wes? tern blotting assay. The 68 and 210 kD Ca independent, reduction-sensitive li? gands for MAF were found tightly bound to the cell surface, in Ca Mg free cr EDTA washes of sponge pieces (210 kD only) and in the sponge skeleton. The cell bound molecules were shown by lipo- some flotation to be non-integral ECM proteins. The 68 kD protein was isolated by MAF-affinity chromatography; it is a monomer in native conditions and in? hibits MAF-mediated aggregation. It binds MAF and membranes with high affini- ties. The 210 kD protein purified by standard chromatographic means using the Western blotting assay is composed of a single peptide chain and has a pl of 3. It does not inhibit aggregation but binds MAF with high affinity, and is associated with MAF non-covalently in the ECM. The cell surface receptors for MAF were found to be ECM molecules which may have their own membrane ligands, as in some vertebrate models. 348 NUCLEAR SPATIAL ORGANIZATION IN COE- NOCYTIC GREEN ALGAE: DO MICROTUBULES ESTABLISH CYTOPLASMIC DOMAINS? H McNauehton and M Goff. University of California, Santa Cruz In uninucleate cells, one nucleus influences a certain volume of cytoplasm delimited by the cell membrane, the so-called cytoplasmic domain. Cell growth triggers events of karyokinesis leading to cytokinesis. In coenocytic green algae, cytokine- sis does not follow karyokinesis. Is there evi? dence for nuclear cytoplasmic domains in these or? ganisms and if so, by what mechanism are they es? tablished and maintained? Coenocytic genera were examined by epifluorescence light microscopy to determine nuclear spatial organization. They fell into two groups: I. those with random nuclear spacing, asynchronous nuclear division, cytoplas? mic streaming (Brvoosis. Derbesia): II. those with regular nuclear spacing, synchronous division and stationary cytoplasm (Boergesenia. Valonia. Valoniopsis. Ventricaria). Nuclei regularly posi- tioned within a cytoplasm may be analogous to single nuclei within a cytoplasmic domain. We hy? pothesized that cytoskeletal elements, in parti? cular microtubules, play a role in establishing this spatial order. When cells of Group II were incubated in microtubule inhibitors, there was a statistically significant change in the nuclear spatial pattern from regular to random in most genera treated. Thus microtubules may establish and maintain regular nuclear spacing (cytoplasmic domains) in these organisms.</page><page sequence="67">Abstracts 67A 349 A MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION OF THE FOREGUT OF LARVAL LEPIDOBATRACHUS, OBLIGATE CARNIVORES.

Point Lcma Nazarene College, San Diego, CA 92106 Larval forms of Lepidobatrachus laevis are exclusively carnivorous and frequent? ly cannabolistic tadpoles living in Argentina. The foregut of a typical anuran larva is tube-like leading to a long spiralling intestine. In contrast to this, tadpoles of L. laevis display an adult like J-shaped stomach with pyloric sphincter and short intestine. Electron microscopic studies indicate that in addition to mucous secreting cells, metamorphic L. laevis larvae have fully operational oxyntic cells capable of producing both HC1 and pepsin. These cell types appear much earlier in meta? morphosis than what has previously been described for more typical omnivorous anurans as well as some carnivorous tadpoles.

M.Mizell. M.Wasserman and J.G.Lamphear Tulane Univ., New Orleans. Three Herpes viruses are responsible for naturally occurring malignancies in their respective vertebrate hosts: 1) LTHV is responsible for the frog carcinoma (Lucke Tumor); 2) Marek's Disease Virus (MDV) is responsible for T-cell lymphomas in domestic chickens; and 3)Epstein- Barr Virus (EBV) is probably responsible for human anaplastic nasopharyngeal carcinoma, as well as being a factor in a human B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma. LTHV was extracted directly from virus-containing winter tumors; purified; and tested for tumor- inducing capacity by embryo injection. When the purified virions were innoculated into outbred embryos, more than 50% of the animals developed typical renal carcinomas. The DNA was extracted from these virions, endonuclease digested, and electrophoresed; good ethidium bromide-stained DNA-fragmentseparation was achieved. Whether employing Kpn, Hind III, or EcoRI, the sum of the fragments produced by each of these endonucleases totaled approximately 1.7 x 105 bp. Thus the frog LTHV genome has a molecular weight of approximately 113 x 10^ daltons. This represents the first report of the M.W. of the oncogenic LTHV genome. The evolutionary significance of LTHV possessing a M.W. that is similar to MDV and EBV shall be discussed. 351 GROWTH AND REPRODUCTIVE RESPONSES OF TWO SHELL MORPHS OF A MARINE SNAIL TO SHELL INJURY. J.B. Getler. University of California at Berkeley and Bodega Marine Laboratory. The consequences of shell Injury for growth and reproduction of thick and thin shelled morphs of Nucella emarglnata were investigated. After shell damage* snails begin a phase of rapid shell deposltion. Fed snails repaired their shells significantly faster than starved snails* indicating that shell repair 1s 1n part energy limited. For both morphs* shell damage induced greater capsule production, but no change in embryo production. Shell Injury also induced changes in capsule size: small snails increased while large snails decreased capsule size. While respondlng similarly to shell injury* the two shell morphs differed in capsule production and pattern of embryo allocation. While total embryo production did not differ* thick morphs produce fewer but larger egg capsules than thin morphs. Variance in embryo allocation to capsules increased with body size for thick morphs* but showed no change with size for thin morphs. Injury induced changes 1n growth and reproduction suggest shifts 1n energy allocation by this marine snail. 352 COMPENSATORY GROWTH AND ZOOID SIZE CHANGES IN A MARINE BRYOZOAN. R.D. Hellinq and CD. Harvell. Cornell Univ., Ithaca, NY. In response to either localized crowding or damage by predators, the encrusting, marine bryozoan Membranipora membranacea increases linear growth rates at unaffected parts of the margin. This results in rapid, redirected growth away from the interaction, thus compensating for space lost due to competion in a severely space-limited envirionment. ln addition, zooid size and shape also change with linear growth rates, further underscoring the importance of flexible strategies of growth in this annual, clonal invertebrate.</page><page sequence="68">68A American Society of Zoologists 353 AUTDTOMY OF CERATA BY THE NUDIBRANCH MOLLUSC MELIBE LEONINA: A MORPHOLOGICAL AND NEUROPHYS10LOGICAL INQUIRY. L.R. Bickell-Page. Univ. of Victoria, British Columbia. A firm pinch to a ceras of Melibe leonina is necessary and sufficient to cause ceratal autotoray ('self-cutting') along a predictable plane. Autotomizing stimuli initiate strong contractions of ceratal longitudinal muscles and sphinc- ter muscles flanking the autotomy plane. These contractions may be initiated by synchronous firing of a group of neurons located within peripheral ceratal ganglia. Two nerve rings within the autotomy plane contain many innervated granule-filled cells that send processes to the basal laminae and associated connective tissue fibrils of all structures crossing the autotomy plane. Degranulation accompanies autotoray. I argue that degranulation of granule- filled cells weakens connective tissues within the autotomy plane, making structures susceptible to disjunction under the tensile stress imposed by the accompanying muscle contraction. 354 THE ACCUMULATION OF CADMIUM BY EMBRYOS, LARVAE, AND ADULTS OF AN HAWAIIAN BIVALVE, IS0GN0M0N CALIFORNICUM. Amy Huffman Ringwood, Univ. of Hawaii, Honolulu. The accumulation of cadmium by various developmental stages of !L_ californicum was measured during short term and long term exposures. In the short term exper? iments, embryos, veligers, pediveligers, and adults were exposed to Cd for 24 hours. With embryos, there was no accumu? lation of Cd during the first 8 hours; then after hatching, substantial accumu? lation was observed. Veligers (15 day larvae) and pediveligers (32 day larvae) immediately began to accumulate Cd. Embryos and larvae accumulated Cd at rates that were significantly greater than adult rates. Pediveligers had up? take rates that were approximately twice those of veligers. The magnitude of differences in the short term uptake rates between the various life stages suggests that the differences are not explained by age specific metabolic rates; but surface area may play an important role. During the long term accumulation experiments, larvae and adults were exposed to Cd for 28 days. The magnitude of differences between larval and adult rates suggests that metabolic rate may play an important role in long term Cd accumulation rates. 355 METAL TRANSPORT BY MYTILUS EDULIS HEMO?

The ability of mussel (M. edulis) hemo? cytes and blood plasma to transport metal contaminants was compared to that of the quahog (Mercenaria mercenaria). Mussel whole blood volume is directly related to animal length (y - 3.12 X lO^X3-*9*; n = 56, r2 = 0.90) and contains twice as many circulating hemocytes as quahogs (2.1 + 0.8%; n = 75 vs. 1.2 + 0.3%, n ? 70). More than 94% of the Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn carried in quahog whole blood is located in the plasma. Mussel plasma, however, generally carries a lower percentage of whole blood metal (75% of the Cr, 85% Cu, 86% Ni, and only 67% of the Zn). In addition, mussel plasma contains only 21% of the whole blood Fe and 44% of the Mn, as compared to 77% of the quahog*s Fe and 84% of the Mn. Equilibrium dialysis experiments on iO^Cd-spiked plasma samples indicate that a much lower percentage of Cd is bound to plasma proteins (MW&gt;1000) in the mussel (34 to 89%) than in the quahog (&gt;95%). Thus, the importance of plasma vs. hemo? cytes for the blood transport of metals is clearly different in each of these species. Funded by DOE Ecol. Res. Div.

The high wave energy, rocky intertidal zone of the Hawaiian Islands consists largely of coralline algal pavement where the sea urchin Colobocentrotus atratus and the limpet Cellana sandwicensis are the aspect dominants. Experimental manipulations of species' densities were conducted to determine the role of competition in this system. Dietary analyses revealed a high degree of overlap. High intra-specific densities significantly reduced growth in Cellana while no effect was found in Colobocentrotus. Inter-specific densities were found to significantly decrease the survival of Colobocentrotus. This last effect was mediated by "bulldozing", an interference machanism described for many patellid limpets. The asymmetry of intra- and inter-specific competition contributes to the maintenance of co- existence in this system.</page><page sequence="69">Abstracts 69A 357 THE ROLE OF SPATIAL AND SIZE REFUGES IN THE INTERACTION BETWEEN JUVENILE BARNACLES AND GRAZING LIMPETS. K.M. Miller and T.C. Carefoot*. Stanford Univ., Calif., and Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver. The effect of grazing by the limpet Lottia digitalis on distribution and abundance of three species of juvenile barnacles (Balanus glandula, B. crenatus, and Semibalanus cariosus) was assessed using slate settling plates containing different types of refuges, as well as fenced areas on natural rock. Two possible negative effects of limpets on juvenile barnacles, namely ingestion and bulldozing, in relation to types of refuges utilized, were further studied in the laboratory. The field studies showed that while shallow depressions offered some refuge against being grazed, proximity to adult barnacles was more effective. In addition, Balanus glandula and B. crenatus attained a refuge in size when they reached 5-6.7 mm^ in basal area. Limpets were therefore shown to have the capacity to change the distri? bution of barnacles reaching adult- hood by limiting them to refuges at early ages. 358 PATCH DYNAMICS IN DEEP ROCKY SUBTIDAL COMMUNITIES. J.D.Witman and K.P. Sebens. Marine Science Center, Northeastem University, Nahant, MA. Sponges, anemones, bryozoans, ascidians and brachiopods dominate space on deep (&gt;30 m) hard substrata in the Gulf of Maine, yet nothing is known about the rate of space provison and colonization in these epifaunal communities. We studied the dynamics of disturbance, patch creation and colonization in permanent quadrats on rock walls and in entire sections of rock walls for 3 years at 30,50 and 65 m depth at Ammen Rock Pinnacle in the central Gulf of Maine. Preliminary results indicate considerable variation in the rate of patch creation with depth. For example, a high frequency of small patches (-15-65 cm 2) were created annually at 30 m by nudibranch predation on the anemone Metridium senile, and by natural mortality or bacterial infection of the sponge Myxillafimbriata. Patches were colonized principally by bryozoans in the first year. Solitary and compound ascidians appeared in the patches 2 yrs after they were created. In contrast, there was less turnover of sponges and anemones at 50 and 65 m depths, although molgulid ascidians and bryozoans recolonized initally bare substrata within a year. The relation between depth, agents of patch creation, and colonization are summarized in a conceptual model. 359 THE INVASION OF SAN FRANCISCO BAY BY THE BIVALVE POTAMOCORBULA. J.K. Thompson. L.E. Schemel*. F.H. Nichols. J.T. Carlton. U.S. Geo. Survey, Menlo Park, CA and Ore. Inst. Mar. Bio., Charleston, OR. San Francisco Bay has again been invaded by an exotic invertebrate, this time by an Asian bivalve, Potamocorbula amurensis. possibly transported into the bay as larvae in ship ballast water. Increasing from one reported specimen in the northern bay in late 1986 to den? sities of 25,000/m2 in summer 1987, this bivalve has established itself as the dominant macroinvertebrate of the benthic community in much of the northern bay. In summer 1987, isolated individuals were found at several southern bay locations and by summer of 1988, large populations had also been found in several southern bay sloughs. Based on estimates of growth at one of the initial settlement sites, we have been able to estimate the probable time of establishment at other locations around the bay. This species appears to tolerate a wide salinity range (5 to 32) and habitat type (coarse sand in channels to fine silt on mudflats), but little is known about its physiology or ecology. If the dense populations of this suspension feeder persist, it will be a major consumer of phytoplankton in this shallow estuary. 360 MASS MORTALITY OF BLACK ABALONE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. B. N. Tissot. Oregon State Univ., Corvallis. During the spring of 1987 populations of the black abalone, Haliotis cracherodii. in the California Channel Islands began a catastrophic decline due to unknown causes. On Santa Cruz Island, mortality rates have averaged 6% monthly between March 1987 and March 1988, resulting in a 70% overall decline in abundance. The recapture and growth rate of tagged individuals have also declined djramatically during 1987. In contrast, on Ano Nuevo Island off northern California, survivorship, recapture, and growth rates have shown seasonal fluctuations but no declining trends. In the spring of 1988 abalone on Santa Cruz Island began to recover in conjunction with dramatic increases in the abundance of subtidal and intertidal kelps. As mass mortality was greatest at sites with high densities of abalone and sea urchins and low abundance of offshore giant kelp (Macrocystis). abalone may have been dying from starvation asji result of the 1982-83 and 1986-87 El Nino events, which are related to the spread of sea urchin barrens and declines in the abundance of giant kelp in southern California.</page><page sequence="70">70A American Society of Zoologists 361 ASCIDIAN ANTIFOULING DEFENSES: SURFACE ACIDITY VS. SECONDARY METABOUTES. A.R. Davls and A.E. Wright*. Harbor Branch Oceanogr. Inst., Fort Plerce, Florida. Differences 1n the percent cover of fouling organisms, surface addlty, and the possible role of chemical antlfouHng defenses were examined for two congenerlc colonial ascidians. Colonies of Eudlstoma capsulatum (Van Name) were heavlly fouled, desplte a highly addlc test (pH-1-2). An average of 12.5% of the surface of this ascidian was covered by 17 different eplblonts. In contrast, E^ ol Ivaceum (Van Name) was fouled by only 2 spedes of eplfaunal Invertebrates, and their percent cover was negli- gible. This spedes possessed a near neutral test (pH?6). Crude extracts of E^ capsulatum showed limited ability to inhibit settlement 1n laboratory trlals, while,E. ollvaceum exhibited potent antlfouHng activity. A secondary metabollte was purified from E^ ol ivaceum and available evidence indlcates that this compound was a eudistomln, one of a host of alkalolds possessed by this ascidian. Laboratory and field assays Indicate that this compound exhlblts potent antlfouHng activity against several dlstantly related invertebrate taxa, yet had no apparent 1cthyotox1c effects and 1s most likely an ineffectlve deterent to fish predators. Our results indicate that differences 1n the degree to which these congenerlc ascidians are fouled is related to differences 1n the chemical defenses they possess and that addlty 1s not an effective inhibitor of settlement by eplfaunal Invertebrates. 362 INDUCTION OF SETTLEMENT BEHAVIOR IN OYSTER LARVAE BY AMMONIA. S.L. Coon, M. Walch, W.K. Fitt, D.B. Bonar and R.M. Weiner. Univ. of Maryland. Oyster larvae preferentially set on surfaces coated with certain species of bacteria, an effect thought to be mediat? ed by both soluble and surface-bound fac? tors. Evidence presented here demonstrates that the major soluble bacterial factor responsible for oyster setting is ammonia. Larvae rapidly exhibited settlement behav? ior when exposed to supernatants of a var? iety of bacteria, and to solutions of NH.C1 and (NH,)2SO, which contained as lit? tle as 100 uM ammonia. Ammonia, rather than ammonium, was shown to be the active molecule, suggesting that the behavioral effect was mediated by an increase in intracellular pH. Other weak bases also induced settlement behavior. The inductive activity of bacterial supernatants was closely correlated to their ammonia con? tent and activity was abolished by decreas? ing the pH of the supernatant. When super? natants were fractionated on G10 Sephadex, bioactivity and NH- coeluted, even under different eluting conditions. Thus ammonia from bacteria and other sources must be considered as a major factor in oyster larval recruitment.

Univ. of Hawaii, Honolulu. Larvae of Ehestilla sibocrae iretamorphosed when exposed to 10 of 14 organic solvents tested. The active solvents included 5 alcohols and ethanolamine, acetonitrile, acetone, cUchloromethane and toluene. Inactive solvents were ethylene glycol, EMSO, benzene and hexane. These compounds span a wide range of polarities and contain a number of functional groups. Ethanol induces metamorphosis over 1-5 days of exposure at 0.5-0.001 M, maximally inducing about 65% of larvae to metamorphose in 3-5 days at 0.1 M. Ethanol is lethal above 0.75 M (4%). Methanol is only lethal above 1.75 M (7%), but produces less metamorphosis than ethanol at all lesser concentrations. The mechanism of induction by these solvents is not known, but is clearly not solvent-specific; the solvents may interfere with cell membrane permeability, triggering a normal metamorphic pathway. Solvent- metamorphosed slugs survive to reproduce, and at least one other gastropod also metamorphoses in response to alcohols. 364 A COMPARISON OF THE BEHAVIORAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF GABA AND CORALLINE ALGAE ON THE LARVAE OF THE RED ABALONE. LA Barlow. Unlv. of Washington, Seattie. GABA and the coralline alga, Lithothamnium sp., will induce competent Haliotid larvae to undergo settlement and metamorphosis. Using intracellular recording tech? niques, It has been shown that GABA (10 uM-1 mM) will cause larvae to arrest the cilia of their swimming organ, the velum. When a ciliated velar cell is impaled with a microelectrode, the cell is at rest and the cilia beat metachronally. An action potential arrests the velar cilia which causes the larva to cease swimming. Larval abalone, when exposed to GABA, will arrest their velar cilia, and strength of this response, in terms of number of spikes elicited, increases with increasing concentration of GABA. Both pre-competent (&lt;7 days) and competent larvae will respond to GABA, and larval sensitivity increases as competency ap? proaches. The shift in GABA sensitivity does not parallel the attainment of competency, suggesting that other cellular mechanisms may be involved in reaching this developmental stage. A protein extract of the coralline alga also induces ciliary arrest. Again, both precompetent and competent larvae can respond to the algal protein at concentrations from -1 to 30 ug/ml, and larval sensitivity increases as larvae approach metamorphic competency. An extract of algal protein at 10-20 ug/ml will induce 100% settlement in com? petent larvae. Although the responses of larvae to GABA and coralline algal protein are similar and may be acting at the same receptor, the location of these receptors remains unknown.

Dalhousie Univ., Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Settlement and metamorphosis of sea urchin larvae in vitro can be induced by the coralline red algae Corallina, Litho- thamnium, and Phymatolithon and by aqueous extracts of Lithothamnium. Treating Litho- thamnium with antibiotics had no signifi? cant affect, suggesting that it is some aspect of the coralline alga, and not a bacterial film on it, which induces metamorphosis. Coralline conditioned sea water did not initiate settlement indicat? ing that the activity Is contact dependent. Ashing, air drying, bleaching, and boiling live coralline algae inactivate the cue, suggesting a biochemical factor, GABA (y-aminobutyric acid) was also found to initiate metamorphosis at concentrations of 10~* M and greater. GABA-mimetic molecules have been isolated from some species of red algae and may direct settlement of urchin larvae. Since juvenile urchins graze coralline algae and its associated microbial film, this settlement inducer may be adaptive in assuring recruitment to suitable environ? ments. 366 MEIAMQRHiOSIS OF THE MARINE ERYOZQAN MEMHRANIFORA MEMBRANACEA. g.A,. StrjcKer, Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison. Ihe colonial marine bryozoan Membranipora membranacea produces a planktotrophic cyphonautes larva that is covered by a bivalved chitinous shell. Oompetent larvae typically settle on algal substrata and spend an exploratory period apparently testing the substratum with their anteriorly positicned pyriform organ. At the end of the exploratory phase, the larva abruptly metamorphoses into the incipient progenitor of the colony, referred to as the preancestrula. Settlement and metamorphosis can be routinely induced in the laboratory by using pieces of algae or artificial seawater solutions that contain a 10 mM excess of K*\ During the first 10-15 see of metamorphosis, contractions of two groups of striated muscles: i) cause the larva to become more spherical; and ii) evert the attachment organ (^internal sac) by spreading apart the larval shell. Secretions of adhesive granules from the everted sac cement the larva to the substratum. The attached larva is subsequently flattened against the substratum by contractions of the non-striated sac muscles. Within a few minutes after the onset of metamorphosis, the aboral body wall fuses with the everted internal sac to form a fully sealed preancestrula. By 3-4 days, each preancestrula develops into a twin ancestrula that contains two feeding zooids and is covered by a calcified exoskeleton. 367 POLLUTION EFFECTS ON LARVAE OF THE RED ABALONE, HAUOTIS RUFESCENS. J.W. Hunt and B.S. Anderson. Marine Pollution Studies Laboratory, Monterey, CA. Studies of the effects of municipal sewage effluents and solutions of zinc and copper salts on abalone larvae have been carried out as part of a program to develop new sensitive marine bioassay tests. Fertilized abalone embryos were exposed to effluent and metal dilutions for 48 hours. Embryos developed into trochophore then veliger larvae in the toxicant solutions. Veliger larvae were examined for larval shell abnormalities, and the percentage of normally developed larvae was determined out of 200 sampled in each of 5 replicates of 6 toxicant concentrations and controls. No Observed Effect Concentrations (NOECs) for 48 hour sewage effluent exposures ranged from 1% to 10%, depending on effluent source and treatment Zinc NOECs were 39 + 2.1 u,g L"1, based on chemically verified concentrations in three tests. Abalone larvae were more sensitive to copper, and were affected at the lowest concentration tested (5.6 [ig L*1). Intcrference with the enzymatic uptake of calcium and disruption of rapid cell multiplication during mantle development are proposed as possible mechanisms affecting larval shell development. The sensitivity of the larval shell development response to zinc was compared to the sensitivity of a longer (9-day) flow-through experiment. In the 9-day experiment, abalone larvae were exposed throughout their entire larval stage to determine the effects of zinc on metamorphosis. Zinc concentrations greater than 19 u.g L*1 caused significant reductions in the percentage of larvae that underwent metamorphosis. 376 ANTI-PREDATORY DEFENSES IN THE GREATER MILKWEED BUG.D.L. Evans.North Shore Community College, Lynn, MA, I investigate the efficacy of the defenses of living Oncopeltus fasciatus when confronted by vertebrate predators. In the laboratory, I offered 0. fasciatus along with palatable alternative prey to five hand-reared and four mist-netted redwinged blackbirds, three mist-netted gray catbirds, and five wild-caught leopard frogs. The frogs consumed all bugs offered with no apparent ill effects. The adult birds refused to touch the bugs and all but one 0. fasciatus survived attacks from the young avian predators. Therefore, kin selection need not be invoked in discussing the evolution of aposematism in this brightly colored, noxious insect.</page><page sequence="72">72A American Society of Zoologists 377 ACTIVITY PATTERNS OF TERRESTRIAL HERMIT CRABS. N. Newton?andS. Gilchrist New College of USF, Sarasota, FI. An ethogram for a terrestrial hermit crab (Coenobita sp.) was developed for an indigenous population on Ambergris Caye, Central America. Activities of crabs were recorded visualiy with a camcorder outf itted with an electronic shutter and by using a 35 mm camera for still photos. Observations on the crabs were taken using the focal animal technique employed during different times of the day and night During the day, the Coenobita seemed to wander long distances while foraging, drinking, engaging in aggressive encounters, and socializing. There was no apparent order to these activities. At night, the crabs spent some of their time foraging and social izing at the high tide mark. Our observations showed that the crabs spent much of the day isolated with only episodic social activity. Very little time was spent in aggressive activty or in shell searching behavior. 378 INITIAL DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSOCIA? TION OF THQR FLORIDANDS TO A TROPI? CAL SBA ANEMONE, BARTHQLQHEA ANNU- LAIA- M.B. Mifaalik. Florida Atlan? tic Univ., Boca Raton. IhQH floridanua was found living with the sea anemone Bartholomea annnlata in the Florida Keys-thus, adding this species of shrimp to the list of anemone symblonts. These shrimp can live with impunity among the anemone's tentacles. Observations showed that Thox will rest directly on the anemone's col? umn or tentacles, or will remain in close proximity to the anemone with frequent tentacle contacts. In the field, the shrimp's cryptic colora? tion made them difficult to observe directly, but their presence and abundance was documented by passing a net through the tentacles of the anemones and finding about four or five shrimp per anemone. These shrimp apparently acquire protect- ion through an acclimation process. Observations on shrimp isolated for &gt;2 wks showed that the shrimp will approach and make contact with the tentacles and respond as if stung, but later appear protected. This protective mechanism is unknown. 379 THE DETECTION OF VOLATILE COMPOUNDS BY ANOMURAN AND BRACHYURAN LAND CRABS: LABORATORY ASSAYS. CA. Wellins*, L. Barlow* and D. Rittschof.-DuTce university Marine Lab, Beaurort, N.C Supralittoral anomuran and brachyuran crustaceans use volatile? compounds to locate food in the field. Field assessment of responses to volatile compounds is effective but strongly dependent upon environmental constraints. The purpose of this study was to develop laboratory assays for the study of responses observed in the field. Two terrestrial crustaceans with known responses to volatile compounds (land hermit crabs, Coenobita rugosis and ghost crabs, Ocypodae quaaraTa; were studied in the laboratory. rield bioassay methods for both species are similar, however laboratory methods are very different and must be adjusted to each species. Studies of the activity patterns of each crab led to the development of bioassays that enabled replication of responses observed in the field. C rugosis responded to the odors of bananas. horse manure, and the pure compound skatole, 3-methylindole, in groups in a binary choice assay. Assay time intervals were short and careful control of air flow patterns was not necessary. In contrast 0. quadrata responded to rish odors when Testea mdividually in a T maze with well defined air flow patterns. The differences in the assay requirements highlight the subtle differences in the behavioral ecology of these species.

Colby College, Waterville, ME. Compared with other mammals, rodent urine contains large quantiues of proteins. Urine from male rodents contains more protein than that from females. This study examined whether the numbers and distributions of urinary proteins from male P. leucopus are influenced by exposure to females. Urine was collected from males that had been paired with females for at least 10 months (Group P, N=8) and from males that were physically isolated (Group I, N=ll) for similar periods of time. Group P males were then isolated and Group I males were paired with females. Urine was again collected from all subjects 1 and 2 weeks thereafter. Urinary proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, stained for general proteins and examined for the number and distribution of bands. The number of bands in Group P urine decreased from 6.0 ? 0.5 when paired to 4.0 ? 0.4 bands and 4.6 ? 0.4 bands during the first and second weeks of isolation, respectively. In contrast, urinary proteins from Group I males increased from 4.7 ? 0.4 when isolated to 5.5 ? 0.4 and 8.0 ? 0.4 during weeks 1 and 2, respectively (ANOVA: Groups, p=.008; Repeated measures, p&lt;.001; Interaction, p&lt;.001). The proteins that appeared and disappeared from the urine as social condition changed were not consistent among individual males. These results suggest that increased numbers of urinary proteins excreted by males in the presence of females may facilitate individual recognition of males by females. This hypothesis will be tested by measuring the time spent by individual females near male urine sources containing different numbers of proteins.

Greeriberg University of Tennessee, Knoxville A study of the possible presence, extent, and dynamics of sociality in the diurnal lizard, Anolis carolinensis. in naturalistic laboratory habitats indicates that this species may not be strictly territorial. Known territorial males were isolated in naturalistic laboratory habitats for 9 days and then allowed free movement between their home cage and two comparable adjacent habitats by means of an opening near the bottom of the opaque dividers that separated them. The opening was such that it consituted an effective visual barrier, allowing subjects to move freely between habitats but not see each other. The average site fidelity was 52% Movements to adjacent cages could not always be attributed to attempts to extend social dominance; in each triad of habitats, the individual showing the lowest site fidelity score also exhibited the lowest dominance score. Individuals dominant in their home tank voluntarily associated with other males in alien tanks where they apparently relinquished their dominance. 382 ENDOCRINE AND BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES TO AGGRESSION AND SOCIAL DOMINANCE IN THE GREEN ANOLE LIZARD. N. Greeriberg, Univ. Tennessee, Knoxville and Dj. Crews. Univ. Texas, Austin Adult males of the small arboreal lizard, Anolis carolinensis. will form social dominance relationships when placed in habitats with limited resources. Social status related behavior and sex and stress steroid hormone levels of 34 pairs of males were analyzed by multiple discriminant analysis to establish a "dominance index," indicating that over 90% of the difference between winners and losers of fights (putative social dominants and subordinates) was attributable to a single discriminant function. Losers of fights had darker body color, selected lower perch sites, and had depressed rates of courtship relative to winners. These animals also had significantly lower levels of circulating androgen than did dominants, but levels of circulating corticosterone were not significantly different. Winners of fights showed a dramatic surge in circulating androgen at one hour but returned to near control values by one week. 383 IS DORSAL DARKENING A BADGE OF STATUS IN THE 1REE LIZARD? IL ZucJsex. New Mexico State Univ., Las Cruces. The use of color badges to indicate social status is currently being docu- mented for more and more taxa. In male tree lizards, fcfrosaurus ornatUS), 3 distinct color badges may exist, but their presence and use varies between populations. The least used badge is dorsal darkening. In a pilot study, the behavior of lizards from a high density population in which males readily darken in the field was compared with that of a low density one in which males usually remain cryptic. I hypothesized that the dorsal badge is used to signal dominance status when encounters between neighbors are frequent; hence the badge is not normally used in low density popula? tions. The behavior and dorsal color of 3-male/l-female groups in outdoor pens were monitored using scan sampling tech? niques. Within two weeks, most groups from both populations had 1 dominant male (based on behavior) and in most of these the alpha male also darkened. Thus, males from the low density popu? lation as well as the other are capable of darkening under the crowded condi? tions in the pens and dorsal darkening is related to dominant social status. 384 BEHAVIORAL AND HORMONAL EFFECTS OF STRESS IN DOMESTIC CHICKENS. S. Williams and D. Bingham.* Simmons College, Boston, MA. Animals respond to stress behavior- ally and physiologically. Previous work in our lab has shown that handling, intra- ventricularly-administered ACTH, and naloxone affect preening behavior in domestic chickens. The present study looked at the influence of novel environ? ment and crowding on behavior of 1-3 kg, 13-18 month Rhode Island Red chickens, and the effect of handling on their be? havior and corticosterone levels. In Exp I, birds observed for 15 minutes in the novel environment and home cages showed decreased mobility and increased vocal? ization in the novel cage. In Exp II, crowded birds showed increased pacing as compared to non-crowded and home-cage controls. In Exp III, birds were exposed to three treatments: no handling, 10 minutes of handling plus blood sampling, and sham blood sampling. Corticosterone levels, measured with a competitive protein binding, radio-assay, were found to be inversely proportional to the levels of preening.</page><page sequence="74">74A American Society of Zoologists 385 PREDATION RISK PROMOTES MICROHABITAT PARTITIONING AND COMPETITIVE COEXISTANCE IN TWO SQUIRREL SPECIES.

Howard CL. Wright Silliman University Marine La? boratory, led by Angel Alcala and Allen White, evolved a system combining ecological research with local benefits. Philippine coral reefs are degraded by intensive and destructive fisheries. Natio? nal regulations are not enforced. A refuge established by local decree increased fish catch and allowed research till destroyed by resentful fishermen. Later, grants financed an interdiscipli- nary team to work with villages on community organization, reforesta- tion and crafts. After marine ecology education, villagers set up and guarded refuges on reefs. Refuges allow fish reproduction and ecological research, may en- courage reef regeneration. Life history studies on tridacnid clams may allow non-destructive maricul- ture on reefs. Pending further funding,Silliman staff voluntarily extend the program to other vil? lages with reefs. The model should prove useful elsewhere. 387 TIME AND ENERGY BUDGETS OF OVERWINTERING MOCKINGBIRDS IN MASSACHUSETTS. K.A. Talentino. K. Dunigan* and C. MacVicar*. Simmons College, Boston, MA. Increasingly Mockingbirds (Mimus polyglottus) have begun to overwinter in the interior regions of the state, when historically they have migrated south or to the coast during the colder months. Time and energy budgets were determined for several overwintering birds located at Broadmoor Audubon Sanctuary in South Natick during the fall, winter and spring months. Percentage of time spent performing various activities (such as perching, flying, bipedal locomotion) was determined at various times of the day. Energy expenditures were based on time budget data, equivalent temperatures, and various types of metabolic data from the literature. As in other studies, our results indicated that mockingbirds modify their activities to accomodate their energy needs. Perching and other low-energy activities were most prevalent during the coldest days and months; flying and bipedal locomotion were more prevalent during the warmer periods. Energy expenditures were highest during the coldest time periods, especially the mornings in February and March. Lowest energy expenditures were calculated for the warmer fall months and in April. With increases in temperature, activity levels change, causing subtle changes in energy expenditure. As the equivalent temperature increased, less energy was needed for thermoregulation, causing a decrease in daily energy expenditure. Such studies will help us to better understand how this species is adapting both physiologically and behaviorally to the new pattern of overwintering. 388 CRITERIA FOR THE AMPHIBIOUS LIFE: CROCODILIANS AS EXAMPLES E.R. Mever. Johns Hopkins Univ., Baltimore The amphibious way of life is on the continuum between aquatic and terrestrial. The amphibious life is distinguished by clear criteria shown by data for alligators and crocodiles. One criterion is that in the reproductive season adults remain near the junction of water and land. A related criterion is that the earliest life stages occur close to the junction of water and land. A third criterion is that energy-intensive construction is near the junction of water and land. Data also support hypotheses such as the distribution of biomass, particularly the reproductive part of the biomass. Criteria from different fields also differentiate among amphibious, open sea, etc patterns. For example head morphologies common among amphibious animals were noted by Hesse, Allee, Schmidt. Making the criteria specific for position on the terrestrial-aquatic continuum has several advantages. This uses detailed data which reveal differences among life stages. It indicates which responses in evolution are unique to an environment, and which responses occur in many environments. This brings out the similarities and the differences among terrestrial, amphibious, and aquatic responses.</page><page sequence="75">Abstracts 75 A 389 THE EFFECT OF BOAT TRAFFIC ON MANATEE (TRICHECHUS MANATUS) DENSITIES AT SELECTED SITES ON THE INDIAN AND BANANA RIVER LAGOONS, BREVARD COUNTY, FLORIDA.

It has previously been demonstrated that hatchling size of the Asian fire-bellied toad, Bombina orlentalls, is influenced by egg size (a maternal effect) and mean temperature and temperature variability during development. It has been observed in a field population in the Republic of Korea that there is intense interspecific predation by larger ranid tadpoles on both eggs and larvae of Bombina. Studies were designed to test in both the lab and field whether the maternal and micro-environmental effects on size impact susceptibility to predation. Logistic regression was used to analyze the probability of escaping tadpole predation in experiments where large and small egg size treatments and natural breeding pool temperature variability influenced early growth and development. The results indicate that susceptibility to predation is significantly altered by the experimental conditions. 391 HABITAT USE BY THE GOPHER TORTOISE (GOPHERUS POLYPHEMUS) IN SCRUB AND SLASH PINE FLATWOODS ON THE JOHN F. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER (KSC). L.A. Giovanetto* and J.G. Morris. Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne. A 300 x 300 m study plot was estab? lished in a slash pine flatwoods stand, to determine the relationships of density to cover types within a mixture of well and poorly drained soil types. Gopher tortoises (Gopher- u_s polyphemus) used all four scrub types (oak, oak/palmetto, palmetto, and disturbed) during the study, but higher overall densities were found in poorly drained areas (palmetto scrub) than in well drained areas (oak scrub). The mean density for this site was 1.89 tortoises/ha, ranging from 1.16/ha in oak scrub to 4.17/ha in palmetto scrub. Signif? icant edge relationships were seen in oak and oak/palmetto scrub. Correc- tion factors to compute the numbers of tortoises from active and from active and inactive burrows combined were 0.34 and 0.20. 392 WINTER NUTRITIONAL CONSTRAINTS ON THE VOLES (Microtus pennsylvanicus). Y.Jean, J.M.Bergeron, J.de Traversay, and L. Jo- doin, (intro. by C.BarretteJ.Tele- universite, Quebec, Univ. of Sherbrooke, and Univ. of California, Los Angeles. 19 plant species were sampled from 06/87 to 01/88 in an old-field near Sher? brooke, Quebec. Nutritional constraints are represented by 4 variables: phenolics, proteins, ADL fibers and caloric content. No seasonal differences (analysed only in stems) were found although monthly graphs reveal a protein spike in June and a nice yearly cycle (high: July, low: December) for ADL fibers. Differences between roots and stems (only analysed in winter) show more root ADL fibers, more stems caloric content and a trend for more stems pro? teins. The study thus shows some seasonal modulation and stem/root differences that could affect vole population dynamics. Also preference (based on fecal analyses) only distinguishes phenolics, suggesting selection based on plant "quality" (no seasonal or stem/root criterion applies).</page><page sequence="76">76A American Society of Zoologists 393 THE POPULATION STRUCTURE OF THE WEST INDIAN MANATEE (TRICHECHUS MANATUS) IN ITS WINTER REFUGE AT HOMOSASSA SPRINGS, FLORIDA. J.G. Morris, C. Ambrose* and K.A. Hicks*, FloricJI" Institute of Technology, Melbourne. The population structure and dynamics of the West Indian manatee at Homosassa Springs, Florida were examined during the winter from 1984 to 1988. Homosassa Springs serves as a winter thermal refugium for an average of 293 individuals, with a range of 140 to 425 individuals. On any given winter day, the spring run will contain 10 to 60 individuals. Adults comprise 63 percent, juveniles 33 percent and calves 4 percent of the winter population. Females slightly outnumber males in each age class except for calves. 394 ANATOMY OF THE JAW JOINT OF THE RATFISH HYDRQLA(3U$ CQLLIEI (HOLOCEPHALI). P.A. Didler. Univ. of Massachusetts, Amherst. Holocephalan feeding systems are characterized by hypermineralized tooth plates and a holostylic jaw suspension. Published dietary analyses confirm that Pacific ratfish (Hydrolagus colliei) crush food. To compare the feeding system of holocephalans to that of other durophagous fishes, I prepared 20 dry skeletons of H. colliei and dissected 10 specimens to examine the Joint capsule and ligaments; jaw joints of three additional specimens were sectioned for histology. The restrictive jaw joint of H. colliei functionally resembles the condition in lepidosirenid lungfishes in that it limits lateral movement and guides the tooth plates to a precise occlusion. Also as in lepidosirenids, Hydrolagus employs a hyoid arch muscle, the hyoideus inferior, to depress the lower jaw. The phylogenetic and functional implications of these convergent similarities are discussed. Supported by Donn E. Rosen Fund (AMNH). 395 THE DENTARY-ANGULOARTICULAR JOINT OF THE PARROTFISH JAW. K.W. Gobalet. California State University, Bakersfield. Parrotfish possess mandibles that bear a joint between the dentary and anguloarticular bones. Five species of parrotfishes and a grouper were studied to determine the significance of this joint. The enlarged coronoid process of the dentary on which the A2 of the adductor mandibulae inserts enhances its mechanical advantage around the dentary-anguloarticular joint. A comparison of the mechanics of the A2 of Scarus with the A1A2 complex of the generalized percoid Mycteroperca shows that for a given in-force, Scarus will have three times the out-force of Mycteroperca. In Scarus the A1 inserts on the maxilla, A3 to the sesamoid articular and Aw is split into a pair of dorsal adductors (synergists of A2) and a ventral abductor that originates from a unique splint process of the anguloarticular. 396 THE VENOM APPARATUS OF THE FANGED BLENNY, Meiacanthus atrodor- salis. Martini, F. Shoals Marine Laboratory, Comell University, Ithaca, NY. The morphology and histology of the venom apparatus of the fanged blenny was examined following plastic or paraffin embed- ding and serial sectioning. The lower jaw con? tains a pair of large, curving fangs, each asso? ciated with a single holocrine venom gland. A venom gland nestles within a shallow pocket along the superior surface of each ramus of the lower jaw. At its rostral border the glan? dular capsule is continuous with a pair of tubes that curve to either side of the poison fang before terminating in an expanded chamber. The fang bears a prominent groove along its anterior surface, and the chamber lies within this groove, separated from the oral cavity by a delicate extension of the oral epithelium. During a bite, pressure applied to the superior surface of the gland injects toxins into the groove of the fang. Oral venom- injection mechanisms have not previously been described in fishes.</page><page sequence="77">Abstracts 77A 397 ultrastructure of the venom GLAND OF Crotalus viridis oreeanus. S.P. Mackessy. Washington State University, Pullman. Adult and juvenile rattlesnakes were collected in Whitman Co., Wash. Gland tissues (in an extracted or unextracted state) were fixed and prepared for light, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy. The main and accessory venom glands are composed of pseudostratified epithelia richly innervated and vascularized, and duct cells form a single layer of columnar epithelium. Gland cells cycle from cuboidal to columnar during the secretory phase; complex interdigitation between adjacent cells accommodates expansion and retraction, and unextracted gland lumina are filled with secreted venom. At least four cell types are present in the glands: secretory, mitochondria-rich, horizontal (basal) and dendritic "dark" cells. Although the first three types are found in both the main and accessory gland3, their spatial orientation differs dramatically, Mitochondria-rich cells of the accessory gland appear to cover the luminal surface of mucous-secreting cells, and masses of mitochondria are near the surface. Secretory cells of the main gland have free apices, and mitochondria are located basally. SEM revealed the presence of intracellular pores in the main gland which are continuous with the lumen and approach the basal lamina; these pores may lead to the surfaces of "dark" cells found only in the main gland. All secretory cells appear to release products via membrane-bound vesicles. 398 PINEAL ONTOGENY IN ELEUTHERODACTYLUS CQQUI. G. Z. Wurst and R. E. Corniea.* Weber State College, Ogden, UT. It has been assumed that all anuran amphibians have a pineal complex charac? terized by the presence of both an intra- cranial pineal body and an extracranial frontal organ. Previous work has sugges? ted that this is true for less than half the genera of frogs (Am. Zool., 1986, 26(4):84A.) We have begun a comparative ontogenetic study of the pineal complex in a series of frogs in an attempt to correlate patterns of development of the brain and skull roof with the presence or absence of a frontal organ in the adult. We report here an initial study ?f Eleutherodactylus coqui, a direct developer in contrast to species studied by other authors. The pineal complex of adult E. coqui includes only an intra- cranial pineal body, visible in embryos as a fingerlike extension of the dience- phalic roof at Townsend stage 9A. The dorsoventrally flattened and elongated pineal extends anteriorly along the brain roof and its lumen is open initially to the third ventricle at the posterior end. There is little change in overall pineal form during development, although commu? nication with the third ventricle is lost in hatchlings and the cells in the walls acquire a follicular arrangement. 399 MORPHOLOGY OF THE VIBRISSAL MOTOR SYSTEM IN RODENTS EXHIBITING DIFFERENT TYPES OF EXPLORATORY BEHAVIOR. L.E. Wineski, M.R. Donald? and S.A. Pitts* Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA. The golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), Norway rat'(Rattus norvegicus), and guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) exhibit three different types of exploratory behavior, as defined by the use of the mystacial (snout) vibrissae. The different behaviors predict variations in the morphology of the vibrissal motor system (VMS), thus, different (possibly over- lapping) anatomical designs underlying the organization of the face. Preliminary studies indicate that the topography and architecture of the vibrissal facial muscles and the general structure of the vibrissae are similar in the three species. The morphology of the mystacial pad is somewhat different in the guinea pig compared with the others. Overall, it is difficult to explain the differences in vibrissal behavior on the basis of gross anatomical differences in the VMS. Functional variation in the VMS may be rooted in finer levels of morphological organization of the face.

Loyola Univ., Now Orleans, LA. We examined surface microstructure and internal organization of the tongue in the macroglossines, Eonycteris spelaea. Macroglossus minimus. and Megaloglossus voermanni to test the hypothesis that nectarivory has evolved indepondently among these taxa. 3-dimensional recon? struction of intrinsic muscio bundles revealed a fundamental difference between Megaloglossus and the other two taxa. In Megaloglossus. a large mass of longitudinal bundles are found in the central portion of the tongue. SEM examination of the lingual surface re? vealed subtle but consistent differences in the form, number, and position of tactile and gustatory papiilae. Despite structural and functional constraints of nectarivory historical factors predicted by indepondently dorived phylogonies appear to play an important role in the evolution of the macroglossine tongue.</page><page sequence="78">78A American Society of Zoologists 401 MORPHOLOGY OF THE AMERICAN ALLI- GATOR (ALLIGATOR MISSISSIPPIENSIS) TOOTH. 1.

The enamel layer was very thin on the crown,reducing in thickness to disappear near the basal region of the tooth. The mineral crystals were arranged regularly on the dentine layer. Many small crystals were located in the region close to the external surface of the tooth. In addition, lamella-like structures (Kvam,1960) and un- mineralized fibrous matrices were elongated up to the external surface of the enamel.

The cementum layer was present in approximately the same proportion as Kvam (1960) reports for alligator. From SEM obser? vations the cementum was seen to contain many small cellular matrices, numerous cellular pro? cesses, and formed complex struc? tures simillar to the mineralized cementum described by Kvam. However., using EPMA mineralized elements could not be found in the cementum of the American alligator. We conclude that the cementum layer in the alligator is fibrous in nature in contrast to the calcified cementum found in mammalian teeth. 403 PERMANENT CARTILAGINOUS STATE OF THE PELVIS AND OCCURRENCE OF HERNIA IN MICE TREATED NEONATALLY WITH TAMOXIFEN. T. Iguchi, S. Irisawa, F.-D.A. Uchima* and N. Takasugi. Yokohama City Univ., and *Univ. California at Berkeley. Male and female C57BL/Tw mice were given 5 daily sc injections of 100 yg tamoxifen starting on the day of birth. In untreated fetal mice on day 18 of gestation, most of the pubes and ischia is cartilaginous; by 30 days of age, the pelvic girdle is completely ossified. In age-matched tamoxifen-treated mice, most of the junctional regions in the pelvis remained cartilaginous. This treatment also caused bladder hernia with or without caecal hernia. The pubic ligament in treated mice at 30-540 days of age was markedly expanded compared with that in the age-matched controls. The pelvis was cartilaginous in all mice exposed to tamoxifen during the first 10 days of life. In contrast, neonatal treatment with clomiphene or nafoxidine induced no changes in the pelvis. These findings suggest that neonatal tamoxifen, in addition to its antiestrogenic activity, has a specific effect on the developing mouse pelvis. 404 Change in calcium and phosphorus concen? trations in mouse femora in response to changes in broad loading conditions. K.R. Gordon. Florida International University, Miami, FL. The question of how different loading conditions affect the mineralization of bone, both locally and systemically, and how these changes interact with geometric and/or architectural changes in cortical and trabecular bone to increase breaking strength is the subject of this study. Energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis was used to determine the weight percent of calcium and phosphorus in cross sections of the shaft of the femora of experimental mice. Preliminary results indicate that in this model system, mineralization is very responsive to changes in loading con? ditions and seems to change locally around the circumference of the shaft of the femur. The local changes, however, are not necessarily the same for each treat? ment group. In addition, the experimental group with the greatest breaking strength does not have a concomitant increase in mineralization. It appears that minerali? zation, the geometry of cortical bone, and the architecture of trabecular bone inter? act in a non-linear fashion to increase breaking strength, depending on the condi? tions of loading.

R. A. tleyers. Dept. Biol. Sci., No. Ariz. Univ., Flagstaff, AZ 86011-5640 Two prevalent hypotheses for the existence of paired epipubic bones in marsupials are that they: (1) function as a pouch support, or (2) serve as a component of the abdominal wall. An anatomical and biomechanical analysis of these bones in Didelphis virginiana suggests that the bones indeed support the pouch as vell as contribute to the abdominal wall. Three connective tissue "pylons" extend from the epipubic bones and linea alba to the pouch. The pylons and epipubic bones transfer the downward force of the young in the pouch from the abdominal musculature to the pelvis. In addition, the diarthrosis of each epipubic bone with the pubis represents the fulcrum in a second-class lever system. Thus, the elevation and support of the pouch via the epipubes requires less muscular force than would be needed if the epipubes were absent. 407 MORPHOLOGY AND HISTOCHEMISTRY OF EQUINE BICEPS BRACHII MUSCLE ? I.W. Hermansnn and K.J. Hurlev*. Cornell University, Ithaca, NY. The biceps brachii of five adult horses were studied to determine the relationship between muscle architecture, innervation patterns, and histochemical fiber type profiles. This muscle has been hypothesized to function as part of the forelimb passive stay apparatus because of its internal tendon spanning from origin to insertion. The muscle must also be adapted as a shoulder extensor to transmit much of the body weight during locomotion. The equine biceps is a pinnate muscle consisting of distinctive lateral and medial bellies, probably homologous to the long and short biceps heads of other mammals. The medial belly consists of relatively long muscle fibers (&gt;30 mm) that are mostly (63- 82%) fast twitch, Type 2 fibers and that should have a dynamic function during locomotion. The lateral belly consists of short fibers (about 5 mm length), is heavily invested with connective tissue, and relatively fewer (48-52%) fast twitch muscle fibers, and is hypothesized to be most important in postural control. 408 HEART WEIGHTS OF ANTARCTIC PENGUINS. C. M. Drabek. Whitman College, Walla Walla, WA. The hearts of Emperor (Aptenodytes forsteri), Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica), and Adelie Penguins (P. adeliae) were weighed and measured to elucidate morphological parameters that might be functional for diving. These heart parameters are the first to be described for penguins. Heart weights of both the Chinstrap (42.4 g) and Adelie Penguins (37.5 g) were greater than predicted for birds of their body size. The weight of the right ventricle in proportion to both the heart and the left ventricle was significantly greater in the Emperor Penguin than in the Chinstrap and Adelie Penguins. An investigation by Baldwin et al. (1984. Mol. Physiol. 6:33- 42) on heart muscle biochemistry demonstrated some dependence of the penguin heart on anaerobic glycolysis. The large heart size of larger-sized penguins may be an important cardio? vascular adaptation for dives of maximal submergence to segregate foraging behaviors from competing species.</page><page sequence="80">80A American Society of Zoologists 409 STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF THE SPERMATOPHORE OF PLEURODELES WALTL. 1-^- Zalisko. Southeast Missouri State Univ., Cape Girardeau Nineteen spermatophores of Pleurodeles waltl were examined using transmission and scanning electron and light microscopy. The cap of this structure was covered by a sticky PAS-positive substance that dissolved in water during the first 15 minutes following spermatophore deposition. This layer may cause the spermatozoa to clump together, remain attached to the cap, and adhere to the female's cloaca as they are picked up when she mounts the spermatophore cap. Beneath the PAS-positive layer the spermatozoa are embedded in a fibrous reticulum; still deeper they are surrounded by a dense granular matrix. The agglutinating properties of the PAS-positive layer may inhibit sperm movement. 410 structural organization of umbil- ical stalk appendiculae in the vivip- arous shark rhizoprionodon TERRAE- NOVAE.J. Lombardi1.!. P. Wourms2, and I. N. Hall**. lUniv. of North Carolina at Greensboro. and Clemson Univ., Clemson, S.C Umbilical stalk appendiculae of 5-7 cm R. terraenovae embryos were investigated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Embryos are connected to the proximal yolk sac by an elongated umbilical stalk possessing numerous villiform extensions termed appendiculae. Appendiculae are presumed to function in maternal-embryonic nutrient transfer and gas exchange. Appendicular surfaces are bounded by a low columnar appendicular epithelium (AE). Intercellular spaces within the AE are greatly enlarged. Most AE cells are apically convex and range from 30-40 um in height and 20-25 ^m in width. Three predominant cell morphotypes are present: 1) cells possessing microvilli, light staining supranuclear vesicles, and evenly dis? tributed mitochondria, 2) cells lacking microvilli and possessing apically situated dark staining vesicles and basally situated mitochondria, and 3) cells possessing microvilli, both types of vesicles, basally situated mitochondria, and a highly developed paranuclear endoplasmic reticulum. Sub- apical cells, 5-10 um in diameter, are adjacent to the basal lamina and comprise a fourth morphotype. Morphotypes may represent either developmental stages or functional states of a single cell type. Anatomical position and cellular organization of the AE suggest a bi-directional transport function and possible role in fatty acid uptake.

Clemson Univ., S.C Large (1 m) masses of catshark (Apristurus sp.) eggcases were observ? ed attached to a rocky outcrop on the lip of the Monterey Submarine Canyon at a depth of 300 m. Sampling of the mass revealed that developing eggs only occur at the periphery while hatched eggcases in various stages of degradation occur in the interior. Eggcases differ somewhat in size and morphological detail. These data indicate that several females used the same spawning site over a period of years. Embryological development resembles that of the shallow water catshark, Scyliorhinus. Embryos do not tolerate incubation temperatures in excess of 12?C Yolk reserves are completely consumed during develop? ment. Term embryos are black and possess an unusual adaptation for hatching. Hypertrophied denticles with their free margin pointing rearward lie along the dorsal body surface. They form a rachet that prevents slippage during eclosion.

Eastern Michigan Univ., Ypsilanti, Syracuse Univ., Syracuse, NY, and California State Univ., Long Beach. Horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus) migrate to shore for mating and nesting. Migrations are correlated with lunar cycle tide height, and time of day, We used tagging, ultrasonic telemetry, and scuba dives to follow the movements of indivi? dual animals. The results of the study suggest that individuals within the population used different rules to determine when and how often to migrate. Tagging data indicated that new individuals continued to arrive at the beach through out the eight week breeding season. Animals were most likely to revisit the beach within two or three days of tagging, but some animals came to shore during the whole season. Tagging and telemetry data showed that males visited the shore more frequently than females. Scuba dives at low tide showed that while some animals remained within 100 meters of shore, others moved further out into the bay. In sum, animals appeared to respond differentially to the same environmental cues for migration.</page><page sequence="81">Abstracts 81A 438 DAILY MIGRATIONS OF THE BROWN SURGEONFISH (ACANTHURUS NlGROFUSCUS). A.I. Mazeroll and W.L. Montgomery. Northern Arizona Univ., Flagstaff. During the summer spawning season, brown surgeonfish (Acanthurus nigro- fuscus) in the Gulf of Aqaba (Red Sea) migrate up to three times daily: from nocturnal shelters to feeding sites, from feeding sites to spawning sites, and from spawning sites back to nocturnal shel? ters. During May - September 1988 we studied routes of travel, times of de- parture from and arrival at various sites, and cues which may initiate migra? tion. Migrating fish tend to follow reef fronts and cue on specific land- marks. Routes followed to and from a given site are not identical. Some groups appear to migrate to spawning sites in response; to light cues. Others migate so as to arrive on the site simul? taneously. In the latter, group size in? creases with distance swum, indicating that many fish initiate their movement to spawning sites by joining passing groups. Thus, behavioral as well as physical cues are important in the initiation of migra? tion.

University of Washington School of Fisheries, WH-10, Seattle, Wa. 98195 In an underwater tag-recapture study, 512 copper, quillback, and brown rockfishes were tagged to determine home ranges, tendency to home when displaced, site fidelity, and habitat preferences on three habitat types: high relief rocky reef, low relief rocky reef, and high relief artificial reef. The results demonstrated that copper, quillback, and brown rockfishes return from displacements up to 8.0 km, assess habitat suitability, and have a hierarchy of habitat preferences that seasonally change in response to habitat suitability, i.e. when suitability is high rockfishes return when displaced and no movement away from the reefs was detected. On the other hand, when suitability is low, rockfishes did not return when displaced and considerable movement away from reefs was detected. The hierarchy of suitable habitats ranging from high to low are: 1) high relief rocky reefs-all seasons, 2) high relief artificial reefs- fall, winter, and spring, 3) low relief rocky reefs- summer, 4) high relief artificial reefs (unsuitable)- summer, and 5) low relief rocky reefs (unsuitable)- fall, winter, and spring. 440 MAGNETISM IN HOMING PIGEONS. V. H. Hutchison and R. L. DuBois*. Univ. of Oklahoma, Norman. The magnetization in the heads and necks of 20 birds was measured separately in a cryogenic magnetometer. Natural remanent magnetization (NRM) and induced (2000 Oe) remanent magnetization (IRM) were measured along three body axes. Total magnetization, declination and inclination were calculated. Curves for stepwise demagnetization from the NRM in AF fields and IRM acquisition were typical for magnetite. Total magnetization of necks (204 X 10"4 gauss) was significantly greater than heads (14 X 10"4 gauss). Highly magnetic particles, some visible to the naked eye and with magnetic characteristics similar to those in whole necks and heads, were found in the necks of some pigeons. In birds exposed to electromagnetic pulses (200 kw/m) the dec? lination in both head and neck were signif? icantly (P &lt; 0.0001) changed from controls. Such a change in innate magnetism offers a method for further behavioral studies on mag? netic orientation.

Blake. Department of Zoology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C, V6T 2A9, Canada. Blue whales (B. musculus) of the southern hemisphere migrate from high latitudes (Antarctic region, feeding grounds) to low latitudes (Tropical region, breeding ar? eas). The possible energy savings of living in warm wa? ters during non-feeding days relative to the energy cost of swimming to them is assessed employing thermal and hydromechanical models. The thermal model equates size dependent metabolic cost as a function of ambient tem? perature with the temperature at which the animal first becomes thermoneutral with respect to its environment (lower critical temperature). By incorporating an expres? sion describing the relationship between latitude and sea temperature, size dependent metabolic rate and lower crit? ical temperature are written in terms of range. Likewise, the hydrodynamic model equates swimming cost as a func? tion of size, swimming speed and range. It turns out that within a myriad of possible strategies concerning distance and swimming speed there is one that is optimal in terms of minimizing the total energy cost associated with the non-feeding days for an animal of a given size. Literature values for migration distance and swimming speed in rela? tion to size support the results of the model. A basic result predicted is that, regardless of size, the ft.nima.1a should mi? grate to where they are thermoneutral rather than stay in the Antarctic waters. However, the relative energetic ad? vantage is greater for smaller whales. Similar results are found based on an energy input/output model.</page><page sequence="82">82A American Society of Zoologists 442 ACOUSTICAL STUDIES OF ZOOPLANKTON VERTICAL MIGRATION BEHAVIOR. CH. Greene. Cornell Univ., Ithaca, NY. New techniques in dual-beam acoustics allow us to document zooplankton vertical distribution and migration patterns with better spatial and temporal resolution than ever before. In addition to following distributional changes of the zooplankton assemblage, these powerful techniqes enable us to acoustically track the behaviors of individual zooplank- ters in situ. Such enhanced capabilities are essential in determining the proximate cues for vertical migration behavior as well as its costs and benefits in terms of energetics and fitness. 443 IMMUNOCYTOCHEMICAL LOCALIZATION OF NEURO? PEPTIDES IN THE CRUSTACEAN NERVOUS SYSTEM R. Keller. University of Bonn, 5300 Bonn, Fed. Republic of Germany. Antisera against several crustacean neuropeptides permitted to study the here? tofore largely unknown neuronal associa- tions of these peptides in the crustacean nervous system. Antisera against the fol? lowing neuropeptides have been used: pig? ment dispersing and red pigment concentra- ting hormones(PDH,RPCH), hyperglycemic and putative moult inhibiting hormones (CHH,MIH) and the novel cardioactive pep? tide, CCAP. For some peptides, distinct, "classical" neurosecretory pathways, par? ticularly in the eyestalk XO-SG complex were found (CHH,MIH). For others (PDH, RPCH,CCAP) a more complex distribution in the nervous system points to a multiple role as neurotransmitters and/or neuro- modulators as well as neurohormones. CCAP, e.g., is clearly demonstrated as a neuro- hormone in the neurohemal pericardial or? gans but is present in other neurons throughout the nervous system which do not seem to project into neurohemal areas. PDH is found,as expected,in axon terminals in the 5G, but it may have an additional role as a peptidergic messenger of inter? neurons. In many eyestalk PDH cells, there is colocalization with FMRFamide. (With support from the DFG, Ke 206/7-4). 444 MOLT CYCLE HEMOLYMPH ECDYSTEROIDS AND EXCRETORY ROUTES IN THE LOBSTER. MJT Snyder, W,At Herfz* and ET?t Chang. Bodega Marine Laboratory, University of California, Bodega Bay. Many different crustacean tissues have been shown to absorb and metabolize ecdysteroids from the hemolymph. We have extended these observa? tions to follow the excretory sites of ecdysteroids from both juvenile and adult lobsters, Homarus americanus. Urine, hemolymph, and feces were collected over the molt cycle and extracted for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and radioimmunoassay (RIA) ecdysteroid measurements. Results indicate that there may be several progressively larger premolt peaks in hemolymph. At the time of the final peak, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE) becomes the pre- dominant ecdysteroid. Higher and lower polarity products are present throughout the molt cycle. In urine, there is also a premolt transition to one pre- dominant form which is more polar than 20-HE. Ecdysone, 20-HE, and lower polarity products are also present in urine. These results are correlated to average urine voiding rates at different molt stages in order to describe the relative importance of various routes of ecdysteroid excretion. 445 REGULATION OF METHYL FARNESQATE LEVELS IN HEMOLYMPH OF Homarus americanus. P.W. Borst, fcL. Martin and E.S. Chanq. Illinois St. Univ., Normal; Eastern Illinois St. Univ., Charleston; Bodega Marine Lab., Univ. of Calif., Davis. We recently reported that the mandibular organs of several crustaceans, including fcL ajmeKlcanus, secrete a juvenile hormone-like compound, methyl farnesoate (MF). MF has also been detected in the hemolymph of several species, but the regulation of these levels is not understood. To study this regulation, we measured MF levels in hemolymph samples from individual male lobsters using HPLC and GC/MS procedures. MF levels vere &lt;1 ng/ml in all animals tested. In most males, eyestalk ablation caused MF levels to rise to &gt;6 ng/ml within 2 days. These results suggest that circulating levels of MF are negatively regulated by eyestalk factors. The injection of eyestalk ablated animals with a sinus gland extract, a rich source of neuroendocrine peptides, caused a dose-dependent reduction in MF levels 80% after 6 hours. Preliminary fractionation of these extracts by reversed phase HPLC indicate that there are several fractions with inhibitory activity.

Bodega Marine Laboratory, Univ. of California, Bodega Bay. Ecdysteroids In the eabryos and serum of brooding braehyuran crabs, Cancer magister and C. anthonyl were measured and characterized by radiolmmunoassay (RIA) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). C. magister embryos displayed a blphaslc pattern of ecdysteroid fluctuation during development; titers decreased until mld-embryogenesls and then Increased and peaked prior to hatching. HPLC-RIA analyses Indicated Increasing ecdysone concentrations from mid-embryogenesis to hatching. Biosynthesis of ecdysone by the embryos Is suggested. In contrast, ecdysteroid titers In the embryos of C. anthonyl showed a steady decrease from much higher initial titers than those of C. magister. The decrease In concentrations of ecdysone and 20-hydroxy- ecdysone Is suggestIve of utilization of maternally-derived ecdysteroids rather than biosynthesis during the shorter embryogenlc period for C. anthonyl. Ecdysteroid concentrations did not differ with respect to location of the embryo within the egg mass. Serum ecdysteroids In C. magister females generally showed a inonotonic pattern during brooding. However, for C. anthonyl, Increasing and decreasing titers were observed during the brood and interbrood periods, respectively. These fluctuations suggest mobllizatlon of the ecdysteroids to the ovaries for subsequent embryogenesis. These results indicate that the embryos have evolved different modes of ecdysteroid metaboiIsm with respect to their 1Ife hlstorles.

Mature males of the freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii may change from one to another morphotype. Each of the three male morphotypes de- monstrates distinctive reproductive behavior and secondary sexual charac? teristics. The role of the androgenic gland in this morphotypic transformation was examined experimentally by bilateral androgenic gland ablation. Andrectomy initiated in the orange claw male mor? photype did not prevent transformation to the blue claw male morphotype. For andrectomy initiated in small males, transformation to the next (orange claw) morphotype was permitted but subsequent transformation to the blue claw morpho? type was blocked. Andrectomy caused disappearance of the genital papillae and atrophy of the sperm ducts and testes. The growth rates of the andrectomized males were significantly lower than those of the unoperated and sham operated controls. I conclude that androgenic gland factors control not only the differentiation of male secondary sexual characteristics but also morphotypic differentiation. 448 MOLECULAR ACTION OF 20-HYDROXY? ECDYSONE, METHYL FARNESOATE, AND JUVENILE HORMONE ON CRAB TISSUES. CR. Paulson and D.M. Skinner. Biol. Div., Oak Ridge Natl. Lab., Oak Ridge, and ETSU, Johnson City, TN. Effects of the putative crustacean hormones methyl farnesoate (MF) and juvenile hormone III (JH), and of the arthropod molting hormone 20-hydroxy? ecdysone (20HE) were tested on the synthesis of [35S]methionine labeled proteins from tissues of the Bermuda land crab Gecarcinus lateralis. Total protein synthesis in integumentary tissues from intermolt crabs was increased significantly in vitro by physiological levels of (2E,6E)-MF (the natural isomer; Laufer et al. Science 235: 202(1987)) but not by JH, the unnatural isomer (2Z,6E)-MF, or 20HE. Individual proteins were analyzed by 1D and 2D electrophoresis. Treatment with (2E,6E)-MF significantly stimulated the synthesis of 9 proteins by integumentary tissue; JH, 3 others; and 20HE, 5. Treatment with 20HE inhibited total protein synthesis by midgut gland and had sex-specific effects on 6 proteins from males and 3 from females. In vitro studies to elucidate the molecular action and developmental role of these hormones are continuing.

Specific concentration of radio- activity was found in brain- retrocerebral-complex, prothoracic gland (PG) cells and other tissues, e.g. imaginal discs, salivary glands, gut, and malphigian tubules. Accordingly, nuclear receptors exist in various tissues during last larval instar.

D.A. Keightlev and W.A. Smith. Northeastern Univ., Boston, MA. Previous studies have demonstrated that peptide-stimulated steroid secretion by tissues such as the adrenal cortex and ovarian follicles requires protein synthesis. With this in mind, we have examined the possibility that translation, as well as transcription, might be involved in regulating the synthesis of ecdysteroids by the prothoracic glands (PG) of Manduca sexta. Pupal PG stimulated with prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) or dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP) were unable to synthesize ecdysteroids in the presence of the translation inhibitors cycloheximide and puromycin,but not the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D. In addition, PTTH and dbcAMP significantly increased incorporation of 35S-methionine into total protein within 60 minutes. With the use of SDS-PAGE, several specific 35S-methionine-labelled proteins were seen to increase in quantity in response to PTTH and dbcAMP. Taken together, the results suggest the involvement of translation, but not transcription in the synthesis of ecdysteroids by the PG of Manduca sexta.

Pasquarello. Northeastern Univ., Boston, MA. Prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) stimulates ecdysteroid secretion by the prothoracic glands of Manduca sexta in a cAMP-dependent manner. However, larval and pupal glands differ markedly in cAMP accumu? lation, suggesting a stage-specific difference in basal or hormone-stimulated phosphodiesterase activity. The present study was designed to determine if and when such a difference arose during development, and its effect on PTTH-stimulated ecdysteroid secretion. The results reveal that phosphodiesterase activity in fifth instar larval glands is lowest just before commitment and highest during prepupal development. As expected, 'phosphodiesterase activity is inversely correlated with PTTH- stimulated cAMP accumulation. Ecdysteroid secretion does not require cAMP accumulation, but does require detectable cAMP synthesis (as measured in the presence of phosphodiesterase inhibitors). The amount of ecdysteroid secreted, however, is not proportional to the amount of c AMP synthesized, but rather is more closely correlated with developmental changes in glandular protein content.

Garcfa-Arraras, I. Torres-Avillan* and S. Ortiz- Miranda*. Department of Biology, University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras. Cholecystokinin, originally isolated frora porcine small intestine, has been reported from coelenterates to protochordates, but not in echlnoderms. We have used immunohistochemical techniques to demonstrate cells expressing CCK-LI in the Intestine of the sea cucumber Holothuria mexicana. The immunoreactivity is observed throughout the cell bodies, excluding the nucleus, in what appears to be granular or vesicle-like structures. The cells are present in the outer connective tissue, and have a neuronal appearance sending an axon-like structure into the circular muscle and internal connective tissue. Contractility of H. mexicana intestine strips was studied under partially isometric conditions. Micromolar concentrations of applied CCK induced relaxation of the basal muscle tension suggesting a role for this agent in the function of the intestine. Supported by funds from the Univ. of P.R.

Univ. of Irmsbruck, Austria and Johns Hopkins Univ., Baltimore, M.D. Life depends on the transport of energy and mat? ter across the rxxmdaries and among the caipartments of cells. According to the chemiosmotic theory, such transport is intimately linked with metabolisra. Diffusion has long been a concept where principles of chemical potential have been unified with a kine? tic description of molecular flow. However, in mi- tx&gt;choodrial oxidative phosphorylation the controver? sy between thermc&gt;dynamics and kinetics remains unre- solved. We therefore examined the tiieoretical basis of flux control, and now propose a novel theory for the reconciliation of thermodynamics and kinetics. Fick's first law is expressed here as a linear rela? tion between flow and "diffusion pressure,' (RT times concentration difference; units: Pascal), analogous to osmotic pressure. A generalization of the concept of chemical pressure provides an explanation for li? near flux force relations observed in mitodxjrririal oxidative phc&gt;sphorylation vhere flux decreases with increasing themcxrynamic efficiency. Moreover, irre- gular flux-force relations are linearized by a transformation into the flux-pressure plot. Saturat? ion of mitxx*x&gt;ndrial enzyme systems, traditionally characterized by % values for ADP and P^ and inhi? bition constants for AIP, is more generally descri? bed in terms of chemical reaction pressure incorpo- rating the phosphorylation potential and the combi? ned total activities of AIP, ADP and P^</page><page sequence="85">Abstracts 85A 454 physiological effects OF AN ectocommensal gill barnacle ON BLUE CRABS. A. T. Gannon and M. G. Wheatly. Univ. of Florida, Gainesville, FL. The effects of infestation by the stalked barnacle, Octolasmis lowei on gas exchange of the host, Callinectes sapidus, were assessed in inf ested versus noninfested crabs by measuring the following parameters: the rate of oxygen uptake (M02), carbon dioxide excretion (MC02), respiratory (f ) and cardiac (fh) fre? quencies, and hemolymph values of pH, oxygen tension (P02), [HCO"3, and lactate. Inf ested crabs were able to maintain M02 and MC02 at the same level as uninfested crabs by increasing f (2X) and fh (1.4X). The hemo? lymph of moaerately inf ested crabs had an increased P02, reduced [HC03 and was rela? tively acidotic. However, severely infested crabs maintained levels similar to noninfested crabs. Circulating lactate concentration appeared to increase with level of infesta- tion. These host responses may explain mortality observed in infested blue crabs subjected to respiratory stress.

Marine amphibious fishes fully emerge from water and are active terrestrially, respiring in air without the aid of lungs or air- breathing organs. This study examines the air-breathing ability of several lungless fishes from the marine intertidal zone, including some that have never been previously reported to respire in air. Aerial respiratory gas exchange occurs at relatively high levels in these fishes, and at least some metabolic scope for activity is present. In general, carbon dioxide release occurs at a rate adeguate to prevent respiratory acidosis, with a respiratory exchange ratio around 0.8. While these fishes share many morphological and ecological similarities, they employ quite distinct patterns of gill ventilation in air. These differ from aquatic ventilation in the movements of the cranial skeleton, and the rhythms and timing of the opercular beats. 456 PERICARDIAL RIG1DITY AND THE ROLE OF THE PERICARDIOPERITONEAL CANAL (PPC) IN SHARKS. D.C. Abel. \V.R. Lowell. J.B. Graham. and R. Shabetai . Scripps Inst. of Oceanogr., UCSD, and VAMC, La Jolla, CA. Cardiac filling in elasmobranchs depends upon low, usually subambient pericardial pressure (PP), due to a semi-rigid perlcardium. At high PP cardiac impairment is prevented by discharge of pericardial fluid (PF) through the PPC. Using the horn shark, Heterodontus francisci, with chronic pericardial catheters, we surveyed possible sources of high PP. PP was transiently elevated and evoked PPC function during feeding (22% of PF ejected, n = 7) and burst swimming (38%, n = 7), and following spontaneous and induced coughs. Chronic PPC occlusion increased PP, PF volume (146% over 8 d, n = 4) and decreased survival time compared to shams. Hence, PF formation rate (0.6 ml ? kg"1 ? h"1) apparently exceeded alternate removal processes. Thus, the PPC likely compensates for both poor pericardial drainage and pericardial rigidity characteristic of this group and defends cardiac tissue from pressure-induced dysfunction.

The comparative organization of the microvasculature in selected amphibians, lizards, marsupials and eutherian mammals was examined using light and scanning electron microscopy of microvascular corrosion casts. In frogs and eutherian mammals microvascular geometry in the central nervous system (CNS), where capillaries are in the form of meshworks, is similar to that found in other tissues. However, capillaries in CNS of marsupials and lizards consist of loops without anastamotic connections. Counter-current blood flow in the capillary loops is suggested by the proximity of the two arms of the exchange vessel and the absence layers normally surrounding the endothelia of individual vessels. We suggest that counter-current blood flow in capillary loops may have been impor? tant in the evolutionary development of a cerebral vascular supply, but loops are not more widespread because of a limited benefit to the diffusive conduct? ance of gases.</page><page sequence="86">86A American Society of Zoologists 458 ANTEROGRADE BIAS OF BLOOD FLOW IN ARBOREAL SNAKES. H.B. Lillywhite and J.A. Donald*. Univ. of Florida, Gainesville. Blood flow (Q) was measured using minia- turized Doppler flow cuffs implanted on the carotid artery (anterior to heart) and dorsal aorta (posterior to heart) of various snakes. During head-up tilt in plastic tubes, semi- arboreal.rat snakes (Elaphe obsoleta) maintain carotid Qat tilt angles up to 60u, whereas dorsal aorta Qfalls to a fraction of horizontal values at all tilt angles. Anterograde bias of Qis attributable to adrenergically mediated increases of systemic vascular resistance, largely in posterior vessels, in addition to morphological features suggesting a posterior- to-anterior shunt of Q during head-up posture. Such regulation of carotid Q during upright posture appears characteristic of arboreal snakes, but does not occur in non-climbing species that we tested. For example, Bitis spp. fail to maintain carotid Qat tilt angles as small as#30?. In all snakes, the regulation of carotid Qis correlated with the ability to avoid dependent blood pooling and increase central systemic blood pressure. Morphologi? cal studies reveal that posterior vessels have a much denser adrenergic innervation than do anterior vessels; such dichotomy is especially pronounced in arboreal species, presumably to assist blood pressure control (Supported by NIH grant HL 33821.) 459 PULMONARY VASCULAR INNERVATION OF THE RATSNAKE, ELAPHE OBSOLETA. J.A. Donald*, J.E. O'Shea* and H.B. Lillywhite. Univ. of Florida, Gainesville, FL Pulmonary vascular innervation of the semi-arboreal ratsnake, Elaphe obsoleta, was examined with neuroanatomical and physio? logical techniques. An extensive distribution of adrenergic, vasoactive intestinal polypep- tide-immunoreactive (VIP-IR) and substance P-immunoreactive (SP-IR) axons was observed on the extrinsic and intrinsic pulmonary vascu- lature. The densest innervation of all nerve types was found on the distal extrinsic seg? ment of the pulmonary artery. The VIP-IR axons may represent part or all of the para? sympathetic postganglionic innervation; SP-IR axons are likely to be sensory nerves. In the perfused lung, vagal stimulation caused cho- linergic vasoconstriction and adrenergic vasodilatation in the distal extrinsic pulmo? nary artery and in the intrinsic vasculature of the lung. No evidence for non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic transmission to the vascular smooth muscle was found. The results indi? cate that neural control of the pulmonary circulation may occur both in the distal extrinsic segment of the pulmonary artery and in the intrinsic vasculature. Such regulation of pulmonary hemodynamics may be important in contexts of intermittent lung ventilation and gravitational effects of posture.

Hematocrit (Hct) and hemoglobin concentrations (Hb) of rosy finches (Leucosticte arctoa) captured at altitudes above 4000 m were similar to those of house finches (Carpo- dacus mexicanus) captured near sea level. In house finches, Hct and Hb had increased markedly 1 week after transfer of individuals from 150 m to 3800 m. Hct and Hb of rosy finches transferred from low to high altitude changed in parallel to those of house finches, but were significantly lower at each altitude. The oxygen affinity of rosy finch blood was significantly higher than that of house finches or Cassin's finches (Carpodacus cassinii) native to intermediate altitudes. The 02 dissociation curves of all three species were strongly sigmoidal, with increasing Hill slopes at high 0, saturations. In rosy finches, high blood 02 affinity and the absence of exces? sive polycythemia at high altitudes could be important long term adaptations to hypoxia. 461 ALLOMETRY OF CARDIAC AND HEMATOLOGICAL VARIABLES IN DEVELOPING MUS MUSCULUS: INTRASPECIFIC VS. INTERSPECIFIC ALLOMETRY. L. Hou* and W.W. Burggren. Univ. of Massachusetts, Amherst. Cardiac and hematological variables were measured in postnatal mice. The relationship between each variable and body mass (M^) was analyzed and compared with the interspecific allometric relationship for adult mammals. Heart rates (fpj) measured in all mice were 116- 585 min"1 lower than those predicted from the interspecific allometry. fjj in mature mice decreased with increasing M^ at the same rate as that based on interspecific comparison. f j_j in immature mice increased with increasing m^. Heart mass and ventricular mass in all mice increased in proportion with M^. Hematological variables remained constant in mature mice. Immature mice differed from adults by (1) erythrocyte concentration and size were respectively 75% lower and twice larger at birth, and (2) [Hemoglobin], hematocrit, and blood 02 carrying capacity were 35% lower. The progressively more profound anemia in neonatal life is probably compensated for by the increase in fpj in immature mice. Developmental factors apparently influence allometric relationship within this species.</page><page sequence="87">Abstracts 87A 462 GROWTH AND METAMORPHOSIS OF LARVAE OF THE DUSKY SALAMANDER, Desmognathus fuscus. J. E. Juterbock. Ohio State Univ., Lima. Comparative study of growth and metamorphosis of stream-dwelling salamanders is generally handicapped both by an inadequate database and lack of a theoretieal framework. Sequential samples of four populations over three years allow me to propose a general pattern for larval growth of D_. fuscus and to test several hypotheses of variation. Although a small amount of growth is possible after hatching in September, most larval growth occurs during the spring following hatching. Along a north-south transect in Ohio and Kentucky the amount of larval growth is greater and the timing of metamorphosis earlier in populations further south. Significant differences in growth occur over distances of less than 140 km, in spite of no such pattern in hatching periods. Intra-population variation in growth also occurs and appears to be related to food supply and ambient temperatures. 463 EFFECTS OF POND QUALITY ON LIFE HISTORY FEATURES OF THE WESTERN SPADEFOOT TOAD K.S. Baldwin. Univ. of California, Santa Barbara. The western spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus hammojadjj) breeds in vernal ponds whose qualities and phenologies vary among ponds within years and within ponds between years. This environmental variation affects larval growth rates, survivorship and size at metamorphosis, which in turn affects the survivorship and age at first reproduction of the toads. Environmental variables used to assess pond quality such as water temperature, oxygen concentration, primary productivity, turbidity, tadpole density, pond longevity and others were measured in three ponds located in central coastal California for one season and related to growth and differentiation of the tadpoles using multivariate techniques. These proximal factors were combined with climatic data for the past 100 years and pond "behavior" profiles obtained from reservoir management models to generate predictive models of the age structures of different populations. These are compared to those of actual populations obtained by skeletochronological techniques. Water temperature determines growth and differentiation of the tadpoles thus implicating timing and temperature of winter and spring rains as major factors in this system. Size and shape of the ponds and their drainage basins is also important in determining pond longevity. A series of dry years could have serious long-term effects on the structure of these populations. 464 EMBRYO WATER ECONOMY, EGG SIZE AND HATCHLING VIABILITY IN THE LIZARD SCELOPORUS VIRGATUS. D. Vleck. University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ. Sceloporus virgatus is an oviparous lizard whose eggs take up water from their surroundings during incubation and embryonic development. I varied water uptake by incubating eggs in the laboratory in soils that differed in water potential. Embryos osmo- and volume regulate, but compensate for low water uptake by converting less yolk into tissue, and hatching at smaller body size and with less water reserves. I examined the adaptive significance of this variance in water economy as follows. Eggs were weighed regularly to measure water uptake. At hatching, lizards were measured, individually marked and immediately released in the field, where survivorship, mobility, and growth rates of the free-living hatchlings were monitored. Bigger is better for baby lizards. The initial size of an egg and the amount of water it absorbs during incubation are positively correlated with both hatchling size and post-hatching survival, and hatchling size is the best predictor of hatchling viability. Mortality is high and less than 30% ofthe hatchlings survive as long as one week. Maternal effects mediated by egg size and water potential of the chosen laying site may be of greater selective importance than genetically based differences in hatchling phenotype during the first months of post- hatching life. 465 SEXUAL DIMORPHISM AND SEX DETERMINATION IN REPTILES. F. J. Janzen. Univ. of Chicago, IL. Much environmental and genetical variation is found in sex-determining mechanisms in reptiles. This variation is not well understood. According to Charnov and Bull (1977, Nature, 266:828-830), environmental sex determination (ESD) is favored over genotypic sex determination (GSD) under certain conditions. In particular, ESD is favored when male fitness is greatest in certain situations and female fitness is greatest in others. Head ?t aL (1987, Nature, 329:198-199) hypothesized that sexual dimorphism in adult body size may be evidence for the adaptive significance of ESD in reptiles. This dimorphism presumably results from large hatchlings of one sex produced at low temperatures and vice versa. Statistical analyses of data for turtles and for lizards demonstrate no relationship between patterns of sexual dimorphism in adult body size and mechanisms of sex determination. Thus, the sexual dimorphism hypothesis is not in accordance with predictions of the Charnov-Bull model.</page><page sequence="88">88A American Society of Zoologists 466 INFLUENCE OF SEX DETERMINATION MODE ON POPULATION AND COMMUNITY DYNAMICS OF REPTILES. D.W. Sugg* and H.L. Snell. Univ. of New Mexico, Albuquerque. We developed a computer model to investigate the interaction between the mode of sex determination and the presence or absence of competition in the dynamics of populations and communities. Population sizes of three "quasi-hypothetical" coexisting species of turtles with different modes of sex determination (one genetic and two temperature-dependent) were modeled at 0.25 ?C intervals between 24 and 30 ?C. These temperatures refer to values for nesting areas in the soil. Two series of simulations were run, one assuming competition among the species and one without competitive interactions. Competition decreased the range of temperatures in which the three species could coexist, and the outcome of competitive interactions changed with temperature. These results indicate that community characteristics (e.g. composition &amp; structure) can be the result of combinations of species interactions and abiotic environmental effects. 467 SEXUAL DIMORPHISM IN SIZE OF GALAPAGOS LAVA LIZARDS: TRAIT OR CONSEQUENCE? H.L. Snell. D.W. Sugg* and E. Amador* . Univ. of New Mexico, Albuquerque and Charles Darwin Research Station, Galapagos, Ecuador. Lava lizards (Tropidurus) of the Galipagos archipelago are sexually dimorphic with males larger than females, but the amount of dimorphism has been noted to vary among islands. Searching for patterns within this variation we combined our measurements of snout-vent length from 18 islands with published data from 6 islands. Both jbsolute and relative ([ xmaie- xfemale] + *male) degrees of sexual dimorphism vary significantly among islands and within some islands among years. Apparent patterns of sexual dimorphism aren't accounted for by phylogenetic relationships, island characteristics (area, altitude), nor geographic locality. Our current research focuses on variation in population density, and in the survival and growth of individuals within and among populations in an attempt to determine whether sexual dimorphism in size repre? sents a trait (e.g. a characteristic potentially acted upon by natural selection) or simply a consequence of varying seiective pressures acting upon a suite of independent traits. 468 FEEDING ECOLOGY OF ANTARCTIC PHAEODARIAN RADIOLARIANS. M.M. Gowing and S.L. Coale. Univ. of Calif., Santa Cruz. Contents of feeding vacuoles and waste pellets of 90 phaeodarians from the Weddell Sea and the Antarctic Peninsula region were examined with light and electron microscopy. Both large (&gt; 1mm diarn.) and small (&lt;300 /xm) forms are omnivorous. Intact cells consumed included bacteria, diatoms, autotrophic and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, cysts and resting cells, and a variety of small scale-less algae. Remains of once-living organisms included silica fragments, Sticholonche spines, diatom frustules, muscle, cuticle, nematocysts, algal scales, protozoan trichocysts, and tintinnid loricas. Unidentifiable amorphous material was also common. Phaeodarians are eaten by larger zooplankton such as salps and krill, and thus link nanoplankton to macro- zooplankton, adding to the complexity of Antarctic food webs. 469 KRILL (EUPHAUSIA SUPERBA) IN THE DIET OF ANTARCTIC SQUID - A SEROLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. Amanda J. Kear. (Intro by ...). University of Aberdeen, Scotland. Antisera were raised to water soluble protein extracts from both adult and juvenile krill and the Laurell fused rocket immunoelectrophoresis technique was used in screening. A scoring method was adopted which allowed results below a 'significant' threshold to be rejected. The only antarctic crustacean amongst 13 tested which cross-reacted significantly with the antisera was Euphausia frigida. Alimentary tract samples have been screened from 3 species of antarctic squid. Mastigoteuthis proved positive for krill (6 out of 10 specimens); Gonatus antarcticus (1 specimen) and Bathyteuthis abyssicola (11 specimens) were negative. Running samples from sub-antarctic squid (Loligo gahi, Illex argentinus and Martialia) as field controls indicated that false positives may sometimes be obtained. Force-feeding the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis with krill slurry enabled investigation of timing and persistence of antigenic material after a meal in the various sections of the digestive system.</page><page sequence="89">Abstracts 89A 470 PALLIAL BROODING IN THE BIVALVE LISSARCA NOTORCADENSIS. R.S. Prezant. Indiana Univ. of Pennsylvania. The Antarctic bivalve Lissarca notorca- densis rarely exceeds 6.5mm in length and yet produces an average of 16 large (1.1mm L) post-larval offspring in a com- pact pallial brood. Adults as small as 3.65mm are capable of brooding although ova start to mature in clams 3.1mm long. Brood and mature ova can coexist in a single specimen. Juveniles, which bypass a typical trochophore and veliger stage, are almost fully developed prior to re? lease. Members of a late brood possess a well developed foot with at least a func? tional pedal mucoid gland, well developed ctenidia with 10-12 filaments, an active two lobed mantle that has already pro? duced a fully calcified shell, a noncal- cified ligament that only later develops aragonitic fibrils, and a nearly complete gut. The stomach at this stage contains a gastric shield and has primary ducts exiting it that lead to secondaries. The digestive gland remains nondifferentiated but is packed with orthochromatic yolk droplets that likely serve as a nutrient reserve. There is no evidence of a maternal connection to the brood for nutrient transfer. 471 SEASONAL PELAGIC DEVELOPMENT AND JUVENILE RECRUITMENT OF THE BIVALVE Lateraula elliptirq IN MCMURDO SOUND, ANTARCTICA. I. Bosch and J.S. Pearse, Inst. Mar. Sci., U.C., Santa Cr&amp;z. Individuals of the circumpolar infaunal bivalve L. elliptira broadcast spavn and produce pelagic embryos that develop singly within egg capsules prior to hatching at an advanced juvenile stage. Spawning activity near McMurdo Station was highest in late March to early April, 1985, and continued to mid May. Development proceeded through encapsulated trochophore and veliger stages that were abundant (up to 50/m3) in the water column, even during periods of negligible currents. Peak settle? ment occurred in late April and May and was followed closely by a high (up to 7600/m3) initial recruitment of juveniles into benthic populations. Our findings contrast previous reports of a brooding habit in this species and suggest that pelagic development may be more common in antarctic bivalves than previously supected. 472 SIZE THRESHOLDS OF THE ANTARCTIC SCALLOP AT NEW HARBOR, ANTARCTICA. P.A. Berkman. Univ. of Rhode Island, Narragansett. The Antarctic scallop, Adamussium colbecki, was studied with SCUBA from 3 to 30 meters at New Harbor, Antarctica, in 1986.

The adults recessed into the sediment and were the primary hard substrate in the region. Juvenile scallops byssally attached to these adults. There appeared to be compensatory mortality, and the population was skewed toward large scallops which were more abundant and growing slower in shallow water. Size frequency comparisons with earlier studies at New Harbor suggest that recruitment was intermittent and that the population may be stable. The size of Adamussium colbecki may regulate the population at New Harbor, Antarctica. 473 ASYMMETRY AND POLYMORPHISM IN THE LATERAL LINE SYSTEM OF THE DEEP-WATER FLATFISH, GLYPTOCEPHALUS ZACHIRUS. 0J_^ Webb. Univ. Calif., San Diego, La Jolla, CA. The asymmetry typical of head in adult flatfishes involves not only the eyes, but dermal bones associated with the lateral line system. This reaches an extreme in Glvptocephalus. where the system is essentially polymorphic. The canals of the eyed side of the head are simple, narrow and well-ossified, but the canals of the blind side are widened and contain unusually large neuromasts typical of deep water fishes. Scale- covered, epithelial tympani cover the large gaps between bony bridges under which the neuromasts lie. These neuromasts are innervated by nerves with large brush-like endings. The existence of asymmetry in the flatfishes is the result of the modification of the basic developmental program responsible for the maintenance of symmetry in vertebrates. The extreme modification of the lateral line system of the blind side of the head in Glyptocephalus probably occurs through the alteration of bone ossification and neuromast growth rates.</page><page sequence="90">90A American Society of Zoologists 474 SOMATOTOPIC ORGANIZATION OF AFFERENT FIBERS AND EFFERENT NEURONS IN THE LATERAL LINE SYSTEM OF GARFISH(GINGLYMOIDI) . J. SONG. UNIV. OF MICHIGAN, ANN ARBOR Central projections of afferent fibers and efferent neurons from each ramus of the lateral line nerves(LLN) in Lepisosteus platyrhincus were traced by use of HRP. The supra- temporal ramus of the posterior LLN, the middle LLN, and the otic ramus of the anterior LLN branches have restricted terminal fields in the medial octavo- lateralis nucleus(MON). These data revealed a somatotopic or? ganization, where the caudal body surface was represented dorso- laterally in the MON, and the rostral body surface medially. The branch innervating the super? ficial neuromasts of the anterior pit line consists of both efferent and afferent fibers, and the affe? rent terminals exhibit a central distribution comparable to canal neuromasts.(Supported in part by NIH grants EY02485 and NS11006 to Dr.R.G.Northcutt) 475 DUAL ROLE OF THE QRBTEAL FHOTOFHORES IN THE STCMIATOID FISH, MAIAOOSTEUS NIGER. A.F. Mensincrer and J.F. Case. Univ. of California, Santa Barbara. Bioluxninescence from the red suborbital and blue-green postorbital rjhotophores was observed by ISIT camera and quantif ied in an integrating sphere frcm specimens of Malacosteus nicrer captured off Hawaii. Ihe light organs flashed spontaneously and independently. Mechanical and electrical stimuli also elicited responses. The blue-green organ produces short flashes averaging 1.50 seconds with a maximum light intensity of 2.8E11 photons/second. Area of the blue-green photophore increases monotonically with standard length. Light output increases directly with photophore area before reaching a plateau in larger animals. The light output per mm2 of blue-green photophore area is greater than most other deep-sea Hawaiian species. The red organ emits a glow that varies from several seconds to several minutes reaching fluctuating peaks of 2.5E10 photons/second. Based on the attenuation of light in water, quantum yield and flash kinetics, the blue-green organ may act as a intraspecific cxjmmunicator while the red photophore is well modified to illuminate prey. 476 MOTOR END-PLATE AND MYOFIBER ARRANGEMENT IN THIGH MUSCLES OF CHICKENS. A. S. Gaunt and C. Gans. Ohio State Univ., Columbus, and Univ. Michigan, Ann Arbor. Recent studies have revealed that cells in long, parallel-fibered mammalian muscles are short, tbeir length not exceeding 5 cm, and have attenuate overlapping ends. Staining such muscles for motor end-plates reveals a series of band-like innervation zones separated by less than the length of the myofibers. Muscles shorter than 3 cm show only a single band, as fibers extend the full length of the muscle. As part of a series of studies to determine the extent of this pattern in vertebrates, we have stained thigh muscles of chickens. These show banding similar to that of mammalian muscle; however, the bands are closer together, being separated by millimeters rather than centimeters. The small muscles of tits and finches have surprisingly similar banding patterns. Staining of the legs of newly hatched chicks shows a banding pattern similar to that of adults. Whereas the number of bands is equivalent to that of adult birds, the spacing is much closer. Supported by an OSU Biol. Sci.

Are primitive firing patterns retained in homolo? gous muscles, making EMGs useful in testing homology? Should developmentally similar muscles be coactive synergists? Is avian myology relatively conserved from the ancestral archosaurian condition? To address these questions, locomotor activity patterns of deep dorsal thigh muscles of guinea fowl (Numida) were evaluated in light of a recent reanaly- sis of their homology (Rowe, 1986, J. Morph. 189:327). The ILFEM and PEFIDOR of Alligator and Varanus are active exclusively in the swing phase. Rowe's purported ELFEM homologues in birds are the ILFEM EXT, with a speed-dependent pattern of stance and/or swing bursts, and the ILTR CAUD, active only during stance. Proposed PIFI DOR derivatives also differ, with the ILTR MED firing in stance and the ILTR CRAN during swing. Obvious differences in activity do not support neuromuscular conservativism nor favor any proposed homology scheme. Modifications of the CNS must be recognized, as well as changes in musculature, when evaluating avian evolution. In birds with undivided or atavistically redivided deep dorsal muscles, EMGs may provide insight into the linkage between pattern and morphology. Out-of- phase activity in developmentally and anatomically similar muscles shows that although apparent action (based on origin and insertion) may be maintained, function may differ radically.

SUNY at Buffalo. The Mauthner cell initiates an escape behavior in fish and amphibians that involves much of the musculature of the head and trunk. The M-cell network must rapidly override other motor circuits to activate muscles in a manner appropriate for escape, even though before the escape those muscles are involved in other functions such as feeding, ventilation and swimming. Studies of the synaptic connections of the M-axon suggest a mechanism by which, the M-cell can override other motor circuits. All the excitatory synapses of the M-cell contact postsynaptic cells in the region of their initial segments or first node of Ranvier, rather than at the cell body. Thus we propose that these contacts, by virtue of their proximity to the spike initiating regions, can override excitatory and inhibitory inputs from other motor circuits that terminate on the dendrites or somata of motoneurons and interneurons.

Univ. of Wisconsin, La Crosse and Univ. of Arkansas, Fayetteville. Several writers have recently claimed that parts of biology are supervenient on physics and chemistry. By this they mean that (a) biological entities are nothing but physico-chemical entities and (b) bio? logical entities, nonetheless, have fea? tures not wholly reducible to physico? chemical features. Let us call this the Supervenience Thesis. Perhaps the most prominent among defenders of this thesis is Alexander Posenberg. Rosenberg, in his The Structure of Biological Science (Cam? bridge, 1985), has argued that both Men- delian genetics and the evolutionary con? cept of fitness are supervenient. In this paper we will (1) assess Rosenberg's argu? ment for his claim, (2) suggest some new arguments, (3) consider new areas of like? ly application for this supervenience thesis, and (4) discuss the importance of this thesis for the future of biological research. 480 THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN CLASSIFI? CATION AND SYSTEMATIZATION AND ITS BEARING ON THE HISTORY OF BIOLOGICAL TAXONOMY. K. de Oueiroz. Univ. of California at Berkeley. The discipline of taxonomy includes two fundamentally different activities, classification and systematization (Griffiths, 1974; de Queiroz, 1988). Classification consists of ordering entities into classes; classes are groups whose members belong to those groups because they share some property or properties. In contrast, systematization consists of the identification of systems; systems are wholes that derive their existence from some process through which their parts are related. Recognition of this distinction and the previous failure to make it, coupled with the historical acceptance of evolution theory, accounts for certain features of the history of biological taxonomy. These features include the waning of the practice of representing biosystematic relationships with networks rather than trees and the current move, as well as resistance to this move, to restrict the concept of monophyly and recognize as valid only those taxa conforming with this restricted concept. The explanatory power of the perspective developed here is illustrated by contrasting it with alternative perspectives that treat earlier ideas and practices that are in agreement with current thought as "correct" or "fundamental" and those that do not conform as mistakes or insignificant aberrations. 481 TWO CENTURIES OF UNCERTAINTY: BEE LANGUAGE AND ODOR-SEARCH PARADIGMS. A.M. Wenner and P.H. Wells. Univ. of Calif., Santa Barbara and Occidental College, Los Angeles, CA. Aristotle suggested bees follow one another out from the hive, while Spitzner suspected in 1788 that the dance maneuver might have meaning. Dujardin in 1852 and Emery in 1875 concluded that there might be a "language" among bees, but Lubbock was unsuccessful in similar attempts to demonstrate such communication. Maeterlinck set the matter to rest for some decades in 1901, with his crucial experimental design, but Francon and von Frisch resurrected the notion again in the late 1930s and early 1940s, respectively. Wenner, Wells, and co-workers partially swung the balance the other way until Gould, Henerey, and Macleod satisfied bee language proponents that a language existed after all. Ironically, Gould, and co-workers gathered data which negated the language hypothesis but apparently could not recognize that simple alternative from their position within the language paradigm.</page><page sequence="92">92A American Society of Zoologists 482 ETHEL BROWNE, HANS SPEMANN, AND ANTHROPOMORPHISM IN THE AWARDING OF THE NOBEL PRIZE. Howard M. Lenhoff. Univ. of California, Irvine. While an undergraduate under the tutelage of T. H. Morgan, in 1909, Ethel Browne (later Harvey) published a re? markable paper. Her carefully planned and executed experiments on hydra appear, in hindsight, homologous to the Nobel Prize experiments of Spemann and Mangold (1924) if we consider the diploblastic hydra's mouth tissue to be developmentally like that of the lip of the blastopore of the frog embryo. Why did the Nobel committee not consider her paper? Did it con? sider the hydrafs development too remote from that taking place in embryos of vertebrates? Did the 1909 paper of Ethel Browne in any way influence the thinking of Spemann or Mangold? These questions become even more intriguing in light of new information about Spemann's familiarity with Browne's work. 490 NEURAL AND HORMONAL CONTROL OF A COURTSHIP BEHAVIOR IN THE 8LUE CRAB. D.E. Wood* , 8. Beltz2*, CO. Derby1 , R.A. Gleeson 3. ^Georgia State University, Atlanta, 4lellesley College, MA, ^hitney Laboratory, St. Augustine, FL. The male blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, produces a stereotyped courtship display in response to a pheromone released by the female. This behavior consists of both postural and rhythmic components. This system is an excellent model for the study of chemosensory and motor integration because it is a simple rhythmic behavior elicited by a defined stimulus. This system has also yielded interesting results related to the neurohormonal modulation of the behavior. In_ vivo electromyogram studies have revealed parameters of the motor program of the rhythmic behavior which allow for iji vitro electrophysiological identification of the pattern of motor neuronal activity. Bioassays of neuromodulators have shown that the monoamine dopamine and the pentapeptide proctolin are capable of producing the postural and rhythmic behavioral components, respectively. We are currently undertaking electrophysiological studies to detect changes in motor neuronal and muscle output in the presence of proctolin and dopamine. Immunocytochemical studies are also in progress to determine the location of proctolin- like and dopamine-like immunoreactivity. These experiments will allow us to identify potential neurosecretory cells in this system.

University of Minnesota, Minneapolis. Morphological effects of a sacculinid (atypical barnacle) parasite were exam? ined in populations of three species of fiddler crabs from estuaries of the Rio Moin and Rio Cieneguita at Puerto Limon, Costa Rica. Incidence of infection for males and females bearing extemae (sac- like parasitic protrusions from the underside of the abdomen) and feminized males lacking externae was 53 of 317, or 16.7% in U. mordax; 10 of 172, or 5.8% in U. vocator; and 4 of 134, or 3.0% in U. burgersi. External infections were all single except for three specimens of U. mordax bearing two externae and one with three. Highly dimorphic male characters (size and shape of the major cheliped, abdominal width, number and form of pleopods, and meral width and pubescence patterns of ambulatories) were strongly modified toward the female state in crabs with externae. Feminized males lacking externae showed intermediate states, e.g., reduetion in length, setal number, and distal thumb size in gonopods of U. mordax. Modifications in gonopodal structure were documented by scanning electron microscopy. 492 THE RESPIRATORY ROLE OF THE SWIMMING PLEOPODS IN THE ISOPOD IDOTEA WOSNESENSKII. D.E. Alexander. Univ. of Kansas, Lawrence. Abdominal appendages (pleopods) are the only specialized gas exchange structures (gills) in isopods; a subset of these pleopods are used for swimming locomotion in many groups. If the swimming pleopods retained their gas exchange abilities, they could provide an energetically inexpensive, self- regulating system to obtain the greater oxygen supply needed for vigorous swimming. Resting O consumption and respiratory pumping rate were measured in Idotea wosnesenskii before and after ablation of one or more pleopods; in one group, swimming pleopods were removed; in the other group, nonswimming pleopods were removed. Respiratory pumping rates were measured by counting strokes over a known time. Oxygen consumption was measured on isopods in a glass respiro? meter chamber with a thermostatically regulated water jacket, using a YSI O meter and probe. On average, the O consumption fell and the pumping rate increased in both groups after ablation. These results suggest that both the swimming and non-swimming pleopods participate in gas exchange.</page><page sequence="93">Abstracts 93 A 493 STREPTOCEPHALUS SEALI: RESPONSES TO HYPOXIA BY RED AND TRANSPARENT ADULTS COLLECTED FROM AN IRON RICH HABITAT. ?. Anderson. University of Southern Mississippi, Hattiesburg. Red female and transparent male ?, seali. collected simultaneously from a roadside ditch in south Mississippi during July, vere compared to evaluate oxygen uptake and ventilation frequency during exposure to hypoxia (PO2 &lt;40 mm Hg) and survival time during exposure to anoxia (PO2 &lt;1 mm Hg), Preliminary results suggest ecological and physiological advantages for red females (presumed due to augmented hemoglobin concentrations in this group) during short term exposure to oxygen depleted habitat vater likely during summer. Under anoxic conditions survival time for females (LT30 - 55 min.) exceeds by almost twofoid that for males (LT30 - 29 min.) (N - 20), Under hypoxic conditions oxygen consumption was highly correlated (R2 &gt; 0.83) with ambient PO2 in both groups. However, ventilation period was independent of ambient PO2 and oxygen uptake was poorly correlated with ventilation period in females; the converse was true for males. Studies are underway to quantify hemolymph hemoglobin concentrations in the two groups. 494 HERMIT CRAB ATTRACTION TO GASTROPOD PREDATION SITES. M. Lepore* and S. Gilchrist New College of USF, Sarasota, FI. An attempt has been made to either identify or narrow down the source (sources) of molecules that attract hermit crabs to gastropod predation sites. It is postulated that such sites provide the primary source of new shells for hermit crabs. Small cages (hardware cloth) were constructed and dialysis tubing (MW cutoff 10,000 and 6,000) was suspended from the inside of the cage. Putrescine, cadaverine, and trypsin/trypsin inhibitor were placed inside the tubing. Different types of gastropod flesh were mixed with the latter chemicals to liberate enzymatic degradation products. Site attendants (hermit crabs) were recorded with the intent of narrowing down the source (sources) of attraction. Preliminary studies have shown a correlation between the species of gastropod flesh degraded at a site and the species of hermit crabs attracted to that site. 495 DAYS OF OUR LI VES: HERMIT CRAB TIME USE. S. L GMchrlst New College of USF, Sarasota, FI. More than 90% of the non-taxonomic literature dealing with adult hermit crabs relates to some aspect of shell use. Information on juvenile hermit crabs also centers around the shell resource. Although there is a considerable body of literature on shell use, there are few data conceming the percentage of time al located by crabs to such activities under field conditions. Ethograms for adults and juveniles of three species of hermit crabs (? pollicaris. P. longicarpus.and ?. maclaughlinae) were constructed. On average, adult crabs al located less than 3% of their time to shell use activities while juveniles spent an average of 18% of their time on shell related activities. These data support a re-evaluation of resource use/competition models established for hermit crabs. NC Faculty Development Grant partially f unded the above research endeavor. 496 BIOGEOGRAPHY OF A CLADE OF UNUSUAL HERMIT CRABS IN THE GENUS PAGURISTES. A. W. Harvey. Univ. Arizona, Tucson. Two undescribed species of Paguristes occur in the northern Gulf of California, on the Pacific side of Mexico, that are extremely similar in morphology and colo? ration to each other and to the western Atlantic P. hummi. A fourth species, E- veddelli, found along the coasts of Peru and Chile, is morphologically nearly identical to these species (color in life is unknown), but is much larger. These species share a number of features that are unusual or unique in the speciose genus Paauristes. The subtle differences among these species suggest several hypo? theses about the phylogenetic and biogeo- graphical relationships within the clade. I evaluate the most likely of these: 1) the Gulf species are both geminate spe? cies of ?. hummi, resulting from separate vicariance events (successive transgres- sions and closures of the Isthmus of Panama); 2) one Gulf species is a gemi? nate species of E- bymmi, whereas the other is the sister species of ?. wed- delli, which itself is a long-distance offshoot of P. hummi; 3) E. hummi actu? al ly consists of two species, each of which is a geminate species of one of the Gulf species.</page><page sequence="94">94A American Society of Zoologists 497 CELL GROWTH AND THE MOLT CYCLE IN Palaemonetes LARVAE. J. A. Freeman University of South Alabama, Mobile. Cuticular expansion at ecdysis is a function of epidermal cell replication during the molt cycle. Analysis of the cell cycle of carapace epidermal cells showed that mitosis occurred during postmolt, Gl during late intermolt, and S phase during mid-premolt. The rela? tionship between 1) epidermal cell repli? cation, 2) growth in cuticular dimension, and 3) molt cycle duration (MCD), was determined by comparing these factors under different rearing conditions. Higher temperatures resulted in reduced MCD and less growth. Larvae treated with 1 jJg/ml ecdysone demonstrated a slightly accelerated molt cycle but little change in growth. Restricted feeding periods resulted in a longer MCD, reduced carapace growth, and less cell replication. Carapace growth and cell replication were a function of the onset and duration of feeding. Carapace growth was highly correlated with epidermal cell proliferation under all conditions, although growth did not always increase or decrease with respect to similar changes in MCD. Epidermal growth may be controlled by factors other than molt- regulating hormones. 498 LARVAL DEVELOPMENT AND HATCHING OF THE MARINE SHRIMP, SICYONIA INGENTIS. R.J. Kidd*, R.J. Bailey, Jr.* and W.H. Clark, Jr. Bodega Marine Laboratory, University of California, Davis. Gravid Sicyonia ingentis were light cycled and spawned in the laboratory (Pillai et al., 1988). Zygotes were cultured in 2000 ml separatory funnels using 200 um filtered, UV-generated ozonated sea water at a temperature of 20?C. Polar body formation and hatching envelope elevation occurred within the first hour. This was followed by the first cleavage (holoblastic) at hour 1.5, blastula formation at hour 4 and gastrulation at 5 hrs post-spawn. Prior to hatching the nauplius larva initiates a pulsating movement resulting in the rupture of the hatching envelope by the larva's caudal spines. The larva emerges posterior end first and is enclosed by an "embryonic membrane". Preliminary data suggest that this "membrane" is the exuvia of a pre-hatch molt. Once emerged from the hatching envelope, the nauplius assumes a period of quiescence before emerging from the "embryonic membrane". In the latter case, the nauplius emerges anterior end first.

George Washington Univ., Washington, DC. Among isolated Alpheus heterochaelis zoeae reared in the laboratory, one or both eyestalks were removed from some animals (experimentals), antennae from others (operated controls), at various times. Virtually all unoperated animals (controls), operated controls, and zoeae lacking one eyestalk exhibited the same abbreviated pattern (3 larval "stages" or instars) typical of this species. Ablation of both eyestalks during Stage II always produced an extra "Stage IV" zoea; these animals usually molted again without chan? ging structurally. Ecdyses into instars IV. and IV? occurred significantly earlier than comparable ecdyses (to postlarva and juvenile) among all other experimentals and controls. Bilateral eyestalk removal a few hr before or after the molt to Stage III often generated forms ranging from precocious ("advanced IV") zoeae to neo? tenic postlarvae. Animals whose eyestalks were removed 12 or more hr into Stage III molted into normal (but darker) postlarvae and juveniles. These results suggest that the larval eyestalk contains a raolt- inhibiting hormone and a factor that promotes metamorphosis. 500 EFFECTS OF DIEL VERTICAL POSITIONING ON DISPERSAL-RECRUITMENT MECHANISMS OF DECA? POD CRUSTACEAN LARVAE AND POSTLARVAE IN THE VICINITY OF THE CHESAPEAKE BAY, VIRGINIA. R. C. Maris. Mansfield Univ., Mansfield, PA. Patterns of diel vertical distribution were determined for decapod larvae and postlarvae obtained at three late-summer locations: York River mouth (estuarine), Chesapeake Bay mouth (transition), Chesa? peake Light Tower (offshore). Each sta? tion was occupied for a continuous 72 hr period, and quantitative plankton tows were taken every three hours from neuston (0.10-0.15 m), 1 m, 3m, 6m and epiben- thos (11-13 m). The collection contained 41 species, 160 developmental stages and an estimated 6,000,000 specimens. Light and spatial proximity to the estuary greatly affected vertical positioning but no significant tidal effects were noted. Six dispersal-recruitment mechanisms were proposed based on variations of diel ver? tical distribution.</page><page sequence="95">Abstracts 95A 501 ONTOGENY OF RESISTANCE AND METABOIZC ADAP? TATION TO SALTNTTY AND TEMPERAIURE IN AN ESTUARINE MYSID. CL. McXennev. Jr.. T.L. Hamaker*.and E. Matthews*, USEPA, Environ? mental Research Laboratory, Gulf Breeze, FL Newly released young of the estuarine mysid, Mvsidopsis bahia. were reared in the laboratory to adulthood in various combi- nations of temperature (18-32 ?C) and salin? ity (3-31 ?/oo). Response surface curves revealed a stage-dependent resistance pattern during the life cycle. Juvenile mysids were least resistant to lower salinities and tenperatures with salinity being the daiiinant factor. Adults were more resistant to salinity and survival was mainly affected by temperature. Optimal salinity-tenperature conditions were 20 ?/oo and 23*C through the life cycle. Changes in resistance patterns to salinity following maturation suggest developnent of osmoregu? latory mechanisms in adults. Acute expo? sure of juveniles and adults to suboptimal salinities modified oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion rates (TO2 ant* VN) differentially. Acute hypoosmotic stress increased juvenile VO2S significantly more than adults. Adult VNs were elevated more by low salinity shock than juveniles. Alterations in metabolic-salinity patterns between juvenile and adult mysids appear to reflect differences in resistance adap? tations to salinity between these life stages. 502 COMPUTER-ASSISTED 3-D RECONSTRUCTION AND MORPHOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF A GASTRODERMAL SENSORY CELL IN HYDRA. J.A. Westfall, J.D. Wilson* and R.A. Rogers.* Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS. Serial transmission electron micrographs from the gastric region of Hydra were used to make a 3-D reconstruction and morphometric analysis of a gastrodermal sensory cell. This study revealed a luminally oriented 30- um-long sensory cell with an apical cilium near an elongate nucleus, which occupied 20% of the cell volume. Proximal to the nucleus was a single axon passing between adjacent digestive and gland cells to terminate at the circular muscle of the gastrodermis. A morphometric analysis of a short axon segment near the terminal revealed that 10% of this synaptic region was occupied by granule-containing, 114-nm-diameter vesicles. Synaptic loci represent 0.2% of this surface area. A reciprocal synapse between sensory cell and neurite of a presumed ganglion cell was observed. Also, both sensory cell and ganglion cell innervated the muscular base of a digestive cell, suggesting a 2-cell and a 3-cell pathway for controlling circular muscular function in the gastric region of Hydra.

The interstitial cell system of the hydrozoan polyp of Halocordyle disticha was examined via transmission electron microscopy. The majority of the inter? stitial cells are found in the ectoderm along the body column. A few ectodermal interstitial cells are present in the hy? postome and in the base. A small number of interstitial cells are found in the endoderm along the lower body column. Two types of nematocytes (nematoblasts) are found in high densities in the tentacle ectoderm, in the ectoderm of the mid to basal body column, and in the ectoderm of the base. A few nematoblasts are detected in the hypostome ectoderm, ecto? derm of the upper body column, and endo? derm of the lower body column. Ectodermal ganglionic cells are found in abundance along the entire body column. These cells are located just above the mesoglea, and their cell bodies are oriented parallel to the mesoglea. Neurites project from each side of the cell body, run parallel to the mesoglea, and make contact with adjacent neurites. Ganglionic cells are also present in the ectoderm of the ten? tacles and the hypostome.

This study compared the effects of a whole nerve crush versus a clean transection on axon regenera? tion in the flatworro NotopJana acticola, A dye-coupled neuron (the VP cell) was followed over a time course from 3 hrs to 3 days in separate animals. Cells were visualized by iontophoresis of Lucifer Yellow at a given length of time after injury. Animals with transections recovered in 6-9 hrs by sprouting filipodia from the proximal axon segment that made contact with a distal axon segment. Recovery from nerve crushes took 3- 4 times as long, although the pat? tern of sprouts elongating was the same. It appears that although a nerve crush leaves unambiguous mechanical guides for a regenera? ting axon, cellular debris from the injury may impede the path for the regrowing filipodia. Transected nerves are usually brought back into close approximation by the surrounding body musculature, and the regenerating axons therefore have fewer obstacles to overcome.</page><page sequence="96">96A American Society of Zoologists 505 PROPORTION REGULATION DURING PLANARIAN REGENERATION. R^ W^ MEAD Univ. of Nevada, Reno. Body regions of planarian regenerates were measured using a digitizing pad in order to determine if proportion regula? tion in these organisms was affected by region of the regenerating fragment. Proportional head size of regenerates varied significantly depending on the degree of anteriorization of the regen? erated individual, initial length:width ratio, and body region from which the fragment originated. This pattern was seen for all regenerates except for those with two heads which were proportionally of the same size regardless of origina- ting body region. Proportional size of the prepharyngeal region also varied according to the parameters listed above and a clear linear relation occurrred between proportional head size and pro? portional size of the prepharynx. How? ever this linear relation was found to differ significantly depending on the region from which the fragment was ob? tained. These results further define the process of pattern formation in planar- ians as it occurs in the regeneration of different body regions. 506 development of the articulate brachiopod terebratalia transversa examined b y scanning electron MICROSCOPY. C. Nislow* and C.G. Reed. Dept. of Biol. Sci., Dartmouth College, Hanover NH 03755. The brachiopod embryo is well suited to the study of morphogenesis as it undergoes many shape changes during development. In the present study we confirm earlier observations of Long (1964,PhD. thesis; Univ. of Wash.) and offer additional ultrastructural information. Analysis of dry-fractured SEM samples of X. Transversa reveals several pattems. Following insemination, the fertilized egg cleaves rapidly several times to form a hollow blastula. In the advanced blastula the epithelial cells become columnar thereby reducing the blastocoel volume. Gastrulation occurs via invagination as the presumptive endodermal cells become bottle shaped. Concurrently, a fibrillar extracellular matrix appears within the blastocoel. By mid-gastrulation several cells at the archenteron tip extend broad, interdigitating lamellepodia that contact the animal pole. These cells eventually detach to form a contiguous mesodermal sheet. Larval coeloms develop as a result of the downward growth of the mesodermal sheet from the archenteron. Concurrently, two ectodermal constrictions divide the larva into three lobes and by three days after fertilization the larva is competent to metamorphose. The developmental similarities between brachiopods and the better studied echinoderms (particularly through gastrulation) are striking. Because large quantities of synchronouslv developing embryos can be obtained for both phyla, comparative studies (both morphological and biochemical) may yield new insight into processes of morphogenesis. 507 EFFECT OF X-IRRADIATION ON LIMB REGENERATION AND ALLOGRAFT REJECTION IN ADULT NEWTS. M.F. Lombard and R. E. Sicard. Biol. Dept., Regis Coll., Weston, MA and Dept. of Pediat., Rhode Island Hosp., Providence. The ability of shielded limbs to be regenerated by irradiated newts presents a potential challenge to the hypothesis that the immune system plays a role in the regulation of epimorphic regeneration. The present investigation explored this question by determining the effects of x-irradiation on regeneration and rejection of skin allografts in adult Notophthalmus viridescens. Regeneration was suppressed only when forelimbs were irradiated directly. Whole-body irradiation (2 kRad) delayed the progress of regeneration of shielded limbs [palette and digital stages were reached in 45 and 57 days as compared to 33 and 42 days for control animals] and produced a slight, but not significant, delay in allograft rejection [33 vs 27 days]. Increasing the radiation dose (2.5 kRad) further delayed, but did not suppress, rejection of skin allografts [36 vs 27 days]. These results lead us to conclude that previous studies using irradiation failed to yield immune suppression. Moreover, the demonstration of an effect of whole-body irradiation on the regeneration of shielded limbs that somewhat parallels effects on expression of cellular immunity is consistent with a role for the immune system in epimorphic regeneration of amphibian forelimbs. 508 TRAN3FERRIN AND THE NEURAL CONTROL OF VERTEBRATE LIMB REGENERATION. A.L. Mescher and W.R. Kiffmeyer*. Medical Sciences Program, Indiana University School of Medicine, Bloomington. To test the hypothesis that neural transferrin is involved in the nerve-dependence of cell proliferation and growth during amphibian limb regeneration, we have developed a very sensitive ELISA for the measurement of this protein in extracts of axolotl tissues. Using this assay we have confirmed that peripheral nerves of axolotls, like those of other vertebrates, are enriched for transferrin. The transferrin content in distal regions of nonregenerating limbs denervated at the time of amputation averaged 50-60t that in the contralateral control limbs at medium to late bud stages of regeneration. These results are consistent with the view that nerves contribute to the quantity of transferrin needed for cycling of dedifferentiated cells during the onset of regeneration in such limb stumps.

Muneoka, Tulane Univ., New Orleans, IA In order to study position-dependent growth during limb development in the mouse we are characterizing the behavior of dissociated cell cxiltures from diff? erent regions of the limb bud. Stage 2 hindlimb buds were removed and cut along the proxmal-distal limb axis to isolate anterior and posterior fragments. Frag? ments from on average 40 limb buds were pooled and trypsin dissociated. Cells were plated in 24-well plate at 3.6 x 105 cells/well (1.8 x 103 cells/mm2) and cultured in DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Growth curves were establi? shed by counting total cells at 15, 48, 72 and 96 hours of cultures. At 15 hours, both anterior and posterior cultures showed a similar increase in total cells of about 1.5 fold (total cells/plated cells). At later time points anterior cultures displayed a steady increase in total cells to 5.5 fold at 96 hours, whereas posterior cultures plateau at 2.5 fold at 48 hours. These results show that limb bud cells possess position-dependent growth characteristics that are expressed in vitro.

Solursh. Univ. of Iowa, Iowa City. The growth and expansion of the ecto? derm during limb outgrowth is studied by transplanting dorsal and ventral presump- tive wing ectoderm plus underlying raeso- derm from quail embryos (HH stages 14-16) to the dorsal region of the prospective leg of the same stage chick hosts. After 24-96 hrs incubation, host embryos were examined histologically. Transplanted ectoderms show position-related behavior after 48 hrs incubation. Dorsal ectoderm remains on the dorsal region of the resulting limb bud and in older hosts covers the distal half of the limb ending abruptly at the AER. On the other hand, transplanted ventral wing ectoderm is displaced from the dorsal to the ventral region of the limb and expands to cover the entire ventral half of the limb and adjacent body wall. The unique property of the dorsal limb ectoderm may indicate differences between dorsal and ventral regions and relates to the ability of the ectoderm to control the pattern of dif? ferentiation of internal structures in the limb, (Supported by NIH Grant HD05505.) 511 CELLS DESTINED TO DIE IN THE OPAQUE PATCH, BUT NOT THE POSTERIOR NECROTIC ZONE, ARE RESCUED BY CULTURE IN MONOLAYER. J.A. MacCabe. Univ. of Tennessee, Knoxville. Embryonic development is marked by many areas of "physiological" or "normal" cell death, precisely programmed in both time and space. In the developing chick wing the posterior necrotic zone and the opaque patch are two areas that undergo cell death beginning at stage 23. Previous work has shown that when the posterior necrotic zone is excised at stage 21 and allowed to continue development in organ culture, it still undergoes its' scheduled cell death. Our experiments show that the opaque patch also undergoes cell death in organ culture when explanted at stage 21. However these areas of cell death behave differently when the tissues are disaggregated and plated as a monolayer. Under these conditions cell death still occurs in posterior necrotic zone cells, but the cells of the opaque patch are rescued. The results suggest these two areas of physiological cell death, though occuring at the same time and in very close proximity to one another, are not under the same kind of control. 512 DEMINERALIZED BONE MATRIX INDUCED CHONDRO? GENESIS AND OSTEOGENESIS ON THE CHICK EMBRYO CHORIOALLANTOIC MEMBRANE. &amp;?, Firlinq, A.R. Severson*. A.M. Seguin*. and R.K. Aronson*. Univ. of Minnesota, Dululh. In mammals, the subcutaneous Implantallon of demineralized bone matrix (DBM) Induces the transformation of flbroblasts Into chondroblasts and osteoblasts (Reddl and Hugglns, 1972). A cul? ture system utlllzlng the chick embryo [Gallus do? mesticus, white-leghorn) and Isogenelc DBM was used to examine the Induction process. The DBM was prepared from the long bones of 10-day cockerals by a procedure modified from Glowacki et al.

Shen.Iowa State Univ. Ames. Metabolic derepression during fertili? zation of the sea urchin egg is dependent upon cytoplasmic alkalinization by Na -H antiport. Hydrolysis of inositol phospho- lipids may act as the transducing mechan? ism. Evidences include the generation of hydrolytic products, parthenogenetic acti? vation by addition of these hydrolytic products, and metabolic activation by phorbol ester, which mimics diacylglycerol by activation of protein kinase C (PKC). Using a series of kinase inhibitors, I have found that cytoplasmic alkalinization during fertilization occurs independent of PKC activity. The presence of K252a, reti- noic acid and H7, all inhibitors of PKC, did not block the rise in pH during ferti? lization. Surprisingly, PKC inhibitors had different activities against PKC agonists. H7 blocked phorbol ester-induced rise in pH, while K252a was ineffective against phorbol ester but blocked the action of diacylglycerol. The effect of fertiliza? tion was blocked by the calmodulin anta- gonist, W7. This agent did not block phorbol ester activity. These studies suggest that the rise in pH during ferti? lization is mediated by a PKC-independent but calmodulin-dependent pathway.

State Univ., Fullerton, CA 92634. Ascidian eggs release a factor into the fertilization supernatant that decreases sperm binding and poly- spermy. This material reduces the availability of vitelline coat N-acetyl- giucosamine groups used in sperm binding (Lambert, 1986, Dev. Biol. 116: 168). This factor has been identified as N-acetylglycosaminidase and has been detected in the fertilization media in Ascidia callosa, A. ceratodes, A. mentula, A. nigra, and Phallusia mammilata. Enzyme activity is detectable in the fertilization super? natant by 15 see. after fertilization and reaches a plateau by 2 min. The enzyme is mannosylated and has a pH optimum near 4.2. Histochemical staining for enzyme activity discloses a distinct decrease in egg surface associated activity following fertilization. 515 A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF SPERMATOGENESIS AND SPERM MORPHOLOGY IN THREE SPECIES OF SCLERACTINIAN SOLITARY CORALS: BALANO- PHYLLIA ELEGANS. PARACYATHUS STEARNSII. ASTRANGIA LAJOLLAENSIS AND A CORRAL- LIMORPHIAN SEA ANEMONE, CORYNACTIS CALIFORNICA. K.A. Beauchamp. Inst. of Marine Sciences, Univ. of Calif., Santa Cruz. Light and electron microscopy were used to investigate spermatogenesis and morphology of mature sperm in these closely related and co-occurring species from Monterey Bay, Calif. Spermato? genesis is similar to those of other cnidarians. Ultrastructural exam? ination, however, reveals marked dif? ferences among mature sperm. The sperm of C^_ californica is similar to other anthozoans. It has a short conical head with no acrosome, a midpiece with 2 prominent mitochondria, and a long flagellum. The sperm head of P. stearnsii and A^. laiollaensis. unlike other anthozoans, is elongated, pointed and has a prominent acrosome. The atypical sperm of B^. elegans have a small round head with no acrosome, a midpiece with 4 mitochondria and a very long flagellum. This unusual sperm may be due to the habit of brooding and internal fertilization in this species. 516 MODELING CURRENTS ABOUT PANOISTIC INSECT OOCYTES. J. G. Kunkel and E. Bowdan. Zoology Department, University of Massachusetts, AmherstMA 01003. Vitellogenic oocytes from the cockroach Blattella germanica examined by means of a vibrating probe (Jaffe and Nucitelli, 1974) exhibit currents which are stable for hours. In the mid-saggital plane ventral currents are inward and narrowly focused whereas dorsal currents are outward and broadly focused (Kunkel, 1986). The sources of these currents can be modelled by measuring the decay of potential, E, with distance normal to the oocyte surface at a position where current vectors are at a maximum, and fitting the values to the equation: E = 2 pi s (1 - (k / sqrt(k* + a2))), for a disc shaped source of radius 'a', current density 's' and measured at a distance 'k' from the center of the disc. The model was fit to data from known point or disc sources and known current. Now this approach can be used to characterize both current density and shape of current sources at particular regions of the oocyte surface. The model is also being used to test whether development or experimental treatments influence the location or intensity of channel function.

Yoder* and I. Brick, New York University, New York. In this study, the dorsal and lateral lip areas of the blastopore in Rana pipiens embryos at successive stages during gastrulation have been investiga? ted by TEM and SEM. Examination of the blastoporal lip areas of the embryos by TEM has indicated a number of points on the lip surface with elongated flask- shaped cells. The distal ends of these cells are constricted, often with the lip surface exhibiting an indentation. The investigators are currently planning high resolution video recording of developing lip areas in Rana pipiens embryos to cor- relate TEM images of the lip surface with observations in the living organism. Areas of unspecialized apposition were consistently observed between the surfaces of cells of the lip and forming yolk plug. These may be required for an orderly and oriented inward movement of cells moving past each other at the blastopore. 518 EVIDENCE FOR INVOLVEMENT OF NERVE GROWTH FACTOR IN NEURAL INDUCTION. H. Lee, K.T. Bush* and R.G. Nagele*. Rutgers Univ., Camden, N.J. and UMDNJ-School of Osteopathic Med., Camden, N.J. Transmission electron micrographs of streak stage chick embryos (in which neural induction is initiat? ed) often show that Hensen's node cells and presumptive neural ecto? dermal cells are widely separated. Nevertheless, radioautography reveals that proteins and other cellular compounds emanating from Hensen's node can be detected in the overlying ectoderm. Although the precise chemical identity of the neural inducer remains elusive, this substance is generally thought to be some form of polypeptide(s) . Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a polypeptide which appears to serve as a neural inducer because (1) it is concentrated in Hensen's node just before neural induction, (2) the neural inducing capacity of Hensen's node grafts is abolished by anti-NGF antibodies, and (3) receptors for NGF are abundant on the surfaces of presumptive neural ectodermal cells. 519 TEMPORAL APPLICATION OF MICROFILAMENT- MEDIATED FORCES DURING NEURAL TUBE FORMATION IN THE MIDBRAIN OF THE CHICK. A MORPHOMETRIC STUDY. K.T. Bush*. E.T. Hunter*, H. Lee and R.G. Nagele*. Univ. Med. Dent. of N.J.-Sch. of Osteopathic Med. and Rutgers Univ., Camden, N.J. We have used morphometry and three- dimensional (3D) reconstruction of serial sections to reveal the role of microfila- ment bundles in shaping of the midbrain during neural tube (NT) formation in the chick. Our morphometric data show that (1) forces resulting from apical constriction of neuroepithelial (NE) cells are not applied uniformly, but rather are concentrated first along the midline and then in the midlateral walls of the forming NT and (2) these forces act together with passive changes in the shape of the neuroepithelium, resulting from development of the head-fold, to cause NT formation. Our computer-assist- ed 3D reconstructions of NE cells during variods phases of NT formation further emphasize the causal relationship between microfilament-mediated apical constriction of NE cells and bending of the neuroepithelium.

R.G. Nagele*, M.C. Kosciuk* and H. Lee. Univ. Med. Dent. of N.J.-Sch. of Osteopathic Med. and Rutgers Univ., Camden, N.J. We recently developed a method which correlates directly the rate of FAXT with the organizational state of the cytoskel- eleton in neurites of cultured chick embryonic dorsal root ganglia (DRG). To determine the role of actin in FAXT, we investigated the effects of cytochalasin D (CD), a mold metabolite that specifi? cally inhibits actin-dependent processes, on the rate of FAXT. DRG cultures with established neuritic outgrowths were exposed to CD and 50 )iCi/ml H-leucine for 1-4 h and processed for correlated autoradiography and electron microscopy. Grain counts, revealing the relative amount of fast transported material, showed that CD inhibited FAXT in a dose- dependent manner. Electron microscopy showed that this effect was accompanied by a reduction in the number of membrane-bound organelles attached to axonal microtubules by way of crossbrid- ges, suggesting a role for the latter in FAXT.

Univ. of Western Ontario, Canada. Ascorbic acid occurs in the brains of both mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates, where its concentration is highest during embryonic development. We studied ascorbate uptake in glia- enriched primary cultures of embryonic chick (Gallus gallus domesticus) neopal- lium cells grown in media supplemented with fetal bovine or horse serum. Accumulation of L-[1- C]ascorbate by glial cultures proceeded linearly with time during incubations of 1 - 30 min. Replacing extracellular Na+ (Na+0) with N-methyl-D-glucamine+, or cooling cultures to 4?C, inhibited [14C]ascorb? ate uptake. Initial uptake velocity also was dependent on external [^C] ascorbate concentration and was saturable followi? ng Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The apparent K^ amd Vmax were approximately 40 uM and 200 nmol ascorbate/g protein/- min, respectively, in 138 mM Na+0. Ascorbate uptake was increased by long- term treatment with 0.25 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP. We conclude that chick embryonic glial cells possess a high affinity, Na+0- and temperature-depen? dent transport system for ascorbic acid.

Average metamorphic body size of lab- reared Bufo americanus decreased signifi? cantly over a 4 week period. Lumbar lat? eral motor column (L-LMC) motoneuron num? ber was variable (-700-1300) but did not show a corresponding average decrease. Unlike in X_. laevis. metamorphic body size and motoneuron number across the entire population of Bufo (n=46) were not significantly correlated. However, in the group of Bufo that metamorphosed latest (4tn week) and at the smallest average size a significant correlation existed. The presence of a correlation between body size and L-LMC number may depend on relatively lesser growth after a stage that precedes both definitive limb and L-LMC development and naturally occurring L-LMC cell death. If true, the hypothesis that limb size influences L-LMC number in normal development by regulating the amount of cell death needs reexamination. An alternate possibillty is that covari- ance of body size and L-LMC number, when observed, is due to their joint depend? ence on some other factor(s), and that epigenetic variations in size rather than causing correlated variations in L-LMC number actually mask a covariance due to this common influence.

Ashcraft*. Medical Univ. of South Caroiina, Charleston. Chloride cells are thought to be responsible for chloride secretion in teleosts. The ultrastructure and density of chloride cells in the gill, inner and outer opercular epithelia, and buccal epithelium of the euryhaline self-fertilizing fish Rivulus marmoratus were studied with electron and fluorescence microscopy. H. marmoratus raised from birth in 1, 50, 100, and 200ft seawater (SW) were compared. Gill chloride cell ultrastructure is similar to that reported previously in other species, except for the presence of the invaginated apical "pit" in all four salinities. In most species the invagination of the apical crypt into a "pit" structure is only associated with adaptation to high salinities. Chloride cell response to higher salinities varied between tissues. Chloride cells from the inner opercular epithelium of fish raised in 200ft SW are 39ft larger (244 um^ vs 176 um^) than those from fish raised in 1ft SW. Chloride cells from the outer opercular epithelium of the 200ft SW group are 107ft larger (334 um^ vs 161 um^) than those from the 1ft SW group. The percentage of the total area composed of chloride ceils in the inner opercular epithelium is not significantly different in fish from any salinity group, while that in the outer opercular epithelium of the 200ft SW group is more than double (16.3ft vs 6.1ft) that of the 1ft group. Chloride cells from gills of fish raised in 200ft SW have a significantly higher percentage of their cytoplasmic area composed of mitochondria than those from fish raised in 1ft SW (69.9ft vs 37.4ft). 524 PRE-IMPLANTATION MOUSE EMBRYOS CULTURED IN THE PRESENCE OF ETHANOL. C.C.Bucken- maier III*and G.W.Kalmus. East Caroiina Univ., Greenvilie, N.C. Two-cell stage embryos were obtained from superovulated CF-1 mice. The embryos were exposed in vitro to ethanol (200-800 mg ethanol/lUU" ml medium) for 60 minutes and then maintained in culture for 105 hours. Ethanol treated embryos survived equally well as control embryos cultured in medium alone. Observed growth ranged from no development to the hatching blastocyst stage, with the majority of embryos attaining the blasto? cyst stage. The reason for the apparent resistance of 2-cell stage, pre-implanta-. tion embryos to high in vitro levels of ethanol is unclear. Ethanol's potential teratogenic properties may only be expressed in the enzymatic pathways and processes of the more developed embryos. Thus, these data tend to support maternal, rather then direct, effects of ethanol on pre-implantation embryos.</page><page sequence="101">Abstracts 101A 525 HISTOCHEMICAL LOCALIZATION OF GLYCOCONJUGATES IN THE HUMAN AMNIO-CHORICNIC MEMBRANE COMPLEX. CA. Singhas, East Carolina Univ., Greenville, 7lc~. Distribution of glycoconjugates within the amnion, chorion, and decidual tissues was examined histochemical ly using HRP-conjugated lectins. These lectins reacted selectively with carbohydrate residues within secretory vesicles, the Golgi apparatus, and extracellular matrix of several cell types within decidua and chorion, as well as the amniotic epithelium. Lectins specific for L-fucose selectively labelled components of both amnion and chorion. Other lectins bound glycoconjugates within the decidua and at the junction between maternal decidua and fetal chorionic tissue. These observations suggest the amnio-chorionic membrane complex may consist of several specialized cell types which may serve to mediate transport of macrcmolecules, and possibly facilitate maternal recognition of the developing fetus. 526 ONTOGENETIC CHANGES IN PROPERTIES OF RECEPTORS FOR ATRIAL NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE (ANP) IN SELECTED RAT TISSUES. R. E. Sicard and J. C. Werner*. Dept. of Pediatrics, Rhode Island Hosp. and Brown Univ., Providence. ANP contributes to electrolyte, water, and blood pressure homeostasis. Its effects on adult target tissues have been extensively explored; but, the developmental physiology of ANP's interaction with target organs has yet to be defined. This investigation examined characteristics of hormone binding [affinity, Kq\ and maximal binding, Bmax] in selected organs at several stages of development in rats. Kd decreased with maturity in adrenal glands [1.1 to 0.02 pM], liver [2.7 to 1.7 pM], and lung [0.5 to 0.1 pM]; but, increased in kidney [0.2 to 1.3 pM]. Bmax in liver was reduced at birth [70 to 20 pg/mg] but did not change substantially thereafter; whereas in lung Bmax decreased more progressively with age [11 to 4 pg/mg]. In contrast, kidney and adrenal glands displayed biphasic changes in Bmax: in kidney, Bmax increased during the suckling period [9 to 20 pg/mg] then decreased [to 3 pg/mg], while in adrenal glands, Bmax fell at weaning [70 to 2.9 pg/mg] then rose [to 16.3]. These data indicate that interactions between ANP and its target organs change during ontogeny. In addition, they suggest that these interactions might be important to the emerging functional roles of these organs. 559 VINEGAROON LOCOMOTION ENERGETICS. CF. flerreidr IX and T'M* paker* state University of New York at Buffalo. whip scorpions, Mastigoproctus giganteus, from Arizona were tested on a small motor driven treadmill while oxygen consumption was measured on an S3A Applied Electrochemistry O2 Analyzer. In spite of their arachnid heritage, vinegaroons use an alternating tripod gait; the first pair of legs are not involved in powering locomotion. Both stride frequency and stride length increased as speed increased. O2 consumption (VO2) was determined for animals for 30 min rest, 20 min locomotion, and 30 min recovery. VO2 rest was 0.2 ml 02/g'h for 14 animals with a mean mass of 4.2 g. JDuring steady-state locomotion, VO2 increased with speed. Although the minimum cost of transport was lower than the values for vertebrates and most arthropods, it was comparable to data we have on other arachnids. 560 EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON PREFERRED SPEED OF FREELY-FORAGING CATERPILLARS. B, JQQS and T,M, Casey, Rutgers Univ. New Brunswick, NJ. Colonies of Malacosoma americanum (3rd-5th instars) were videotaped while moving across a grid-marked section of the foraging trail during spontaneous activity bouts in the field. Body temperatures (Tb) ranged from 7-30.5?C during taping periods. Body length ranged from 0.8-5.5 cm (mean 2.5 ? 0.06, n=870). Speed (cm/s) was strongly correlated with Tb and body length ( multiple r2=0.817) as was length-specific speed (multiple r2=0.810). Stride frequency was strongly temperature dependent (r2=0.839) but was independent of body length. Stride length increased with body length (r2=0.738) and also increased slightly with increasing temperature. Speed was nearly directly proportional to stride frequency (slope = 0.96; r2 =0.734) whereas stride length increased only slightly with increasing speed. These results suggest that the net cost of transport will be relatively temperature insensitive although total foraging time may increase at lower Tb. (Supported by the NJ Agric. Exper.

To examine the effects of temperature on terrestrial locomotion, we measured oxygen consumption and endurance capacity of Blaberus discoidalis exercising at 15, 23 and 34?C. B. discoidalis increased thoracic temperature (ATt) linearly with speed (v, km rr1) at all experimental temperatures (ATt = 5.13v + 0.14). Maximum ATt was 6.5?C. The Q10 of resting oxygen consumption (Vo2rest) was 2.0 from 15-34?C. At all experimental temperatures, steady-state oxygen consumption (Vo2ss, ml O2 g"1h-1) increased linearly with speed to an apparent maximum: at 15?C Vo2ss = 6.24v + 0.51, at 23?C Vo2ss - 5.50v + 0.75, and at 34?C Vo2ss = 6.44v + 0.76. Maximal oxygen consumption (Vo2max) was not significantly different at 23 and 34?C, representing a 23-fold increase over resting values at 23?C and a 10-fold increase at 34?C. At 15?C Vo2max was reduced, but was 15-fold greater than Vo2rest- The minimum cost of locomotion (the amount of oxygen needed to move 1 gram of animal 1 km) was temperature independent. Animals exercised at 23?C had greater endurance than those exercised at 15 or 35?C. Exercised induced endothermy enabled cockroaches running at low environmental temperatures to attain a higher Vo2max and exhibit a greater capacity for activity.

To study the effect of variation in form on legged locomotion, we used a miniature force plate to measure the ground reaction forces of the cockroach, Blaberus discoidalis (mass = 2.6 g). Cockroaches used an alternating tripod gait between 0.14 and 0.66 m/s. Patterns of ground reaction force produced by six- legged cockroaches were remarkably similar to those produced by two, four and eight-legged runners. Fluctuations in potential and horizontal kinetic energy of the center of mass were in phase. The rate of external work (Eext) increased linearly with speed (Eext = 0.89 v - 0.03, r2 s 0.63, where Eext is in watts kg-1 and speed in m/s). The mass-specific mechanical energy used to move the center of mass a given distance (0.9 J/m/kg) was similar to that produced by ghost crabs, mammals and birds. Cockroaches attained a maximum sustainable stride frequency of 13 Hz at 0.3 m/s, the same speed and frequency predicted from the extrapolation of the trot-gallop transition relationship of mammals. Similarities in force patterns, stride frequency, speed at gait transitions and mechanical energy production suggest common constraints in animals varying in leg number, style of locomotion, and skeletal type.

The Australian field cricket, Teleogryllus commodus, is a 6-legged runner specialized for jumping and flying. Males and females (~1g) were exercised for 20 min on a miniature treadmill enclosed within a respirometer, while oxygen consumption was monitored continuously. Crickets ran consistently, hopping intermittently at high speeds. Steady-state oxygen consumption (Vq2s&amp; m' O2 g_1 h-1) increased directly with speed (v, km h-1) for both sexes. The regression equation for males, v02ss= 8.06v + 1.10, was not significantly different from that for females. The minimum cost of locomotion (Cmin). the least amount of energy required to travel a given distance, was 67% higher than predicted from body mass, but within the range of values reported for insects. Mated females, which show reduced locomotor behavior after mating, had a comparable Cmjn. Egg mass made up 27.9% of a mature female's body mass, whereas it was less than 2% of an immature female. Cmin in mature females (9.2 ml O2 g_1 km-1) was not statistically different from the value of immature females (9.9 ml O2 g_1 km-1). Energy cost increased in proportion to egg mass. The effects of variation in form, loading and sex on energy cost were minimal. The best determinant of Cmin was body mass.

Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Republic of Panama. A suite of kinematic, physiological, and morphometric parameters was determined for migrating IL_ fulgens moths in free flight over Lake Gatun, Republic of Panama. By following moths in a small boat, we were able to measure directly an insect's airspeed, film the insect to determine wing kinematics, and then capture the same insect for thoracic temperature and morphological measurements. Thoracic temperature was regulated with respect to ambient temperature. Despite large differences in body mass, male and female U. fulgens flew at approximately the same airspeeds and maintained equivalent thoracic temperatures. Power requirements of forward flight were estimated from wing kinematics using a detailed aerodynamic model. A comparison of estimated metabolic rates with endogenous lipid reserves suggests that IL_ fulgens feeds extensively on flower nectar during migration from Central into South America.</page><page sequence="103">Abstracts 103A 565 INTRA-SPECIFIC VARIATION IN THE ENERGETIC EFFICIENCY OF SOUND PRODUCTION IN CRICKETS.

Efficiency varied by less than 20% in single individuals. For all individuals, efficiencies varied 7.3 fold (0.024% to 0.175%) with a mean efficiency of 0.093% +/- 0.012% (SEM), N=13. Exceptional crickets produced sound in both lab and field at efficiencies of 0.0014%. Mean net metabolic costs of sound production were 7.27 +/- 0.38 mW (mass 0.3077 +/- 0.0119g; RQ = 1.05 +/- 0.08) and acoustic power outputs were 6.58 +/- 0.094 mW. There were no significant relation? ships between mass and sound field or efficiency. Examination of wings suggest intra-specific differences in efficiency are due to mechanical or behavioral differences and that the main cost of stridulatory calls is in accelerating the tegmina. Reasons for the low efficiencies of sound production will be discussed. 566 ENERGETICS OF SUSTAINED WALKING VERSUS HOPPING IN THE TOAD, BUFO WOODHOUSEl FOWLERI B.D. Andersonl, M.E. Federi and R.J. Full2. Univ. of Chicago 1 and Univ. of California at Berkeley2. Toads were forced to adopt a walking gait by restricting the length of a treadmill respirometer. Oxygen consumption (V02) was determined during exercise at speeds ranging from 1 - 4 cm/sec. We compared data on forced walking to more natural locomotion during which toads primarily hop and occasionally walk. Toads forced to use a walking gait moved consistently, but could sustain speeds only 1/4 that of animals which hopped. Toads attained a steady-state V02 within 5 - 7 min. V02 increased 4 - 6-fold above resting rates during forced walking and was independent of speed across the narrow range of speeds toads could sustain. Non-aerobic energy sources most likely add to the cost of forced walking. During forced walking, toads consumed oxygen at rates 50% higher than animals which could choose their gait. Stride frequency during forced walking was twice that of hopping. The energetic cost per hop was 1.3-foid greater than the cost per step during forced walking. Although a hop is more costly than a step, the distance traversed in a hop is far greater. Toads select the gait that minimizes energy cost.

Univ. of Chicago, Chicago, IL I measured the aerobic energetic costs of calling in 5 species of hylid frogs (Fseudacris crucifer. ?. regilla. Hyla cinerea. H. vergicplQr, and JH- qratiosa) using open - flow respirometry. This technique allowed me to monitor rate of oxygen consumption (^02) of calling frogs for periods of 15 mins to 4.5 hours (average period = 90?10 mins). Audio recordings were used to match calling effort with V02. Within individuals, ^02 varied with call rate. The frogs called in bouts that were preceded and followed by periods of silence. Bout length varied among species from 4.8?1.1 mins in H.. cinerea to 11.5?3.8 mins in ?. crucifer. Maximum call rate varied from 1069?137 calls/hr in HL versicolor to#6109?288 calls/hr in P. crucifer. Maximum v*02 during calling varied from 0.96?0.10 ml 02/g/h in H_. cinerea to 1.50?0.12 ml 02/g/h in P. crucifer. Species differences in energetic costs of calling were largely related to differences in body mass and call rate (R2= 0.50). However, longer, more complex, trilled calls of H.versicolor were more costly than shorter, simpler calls of the other species. 568 XANTUSIID LIZARDS HAVE LOW FIELD METABOLIC RATES. W. J. Mautz and K. A. Nagy.* Univ. of California, Irvine and Los Angeles. Among squamate reptiles, low resting metabolism is associated with reclusiveor fossorial habits, and is hypothesized to be an adaptation for low energy require? ments in habitats with scarce food. Stan? dard metabolism of xantusiids is 50-70% that expected for lizards of equivalent mass. Using doubly labeled water, we measured field metabolic rates (FMR) of 3 xantusiids. While FMR of 2 nocturnal gek- konids does not differ from that of equi? valent sized iguanids, xantusiid FMR's were 67% lower. This reduetion is achieved via several levels of biological organi? zation including low tissue maintenance metabolism, low body temperature selection and sedentary behavior. Although low energy flow, slow growth, and low repro? ductive rates may be considered competi- tively inferior, and fragmented distri? butions of xantusiids may be considered relictual, low metabolism does not appear relictual among Squamata. Low metabolism is functionally significant in environ? ments with scarce food resources, it is found in cavernicolous animals, and among lizards, it may be independently derived within families with diversified reclusive ecology such as Gekkonidae, Anguidae, and Scincidae.</page><page sequence="104">104A American Society of Zoologists 569 DIFFERENCES IN HYDROCARBON UPTAKE AND MIXED FUNCTION OXIDASE ACTIVITY BETWEEN JUVENILE AND SPAWNING ADULT COHO SALMON EXPOSED TO COOK INLET CRUDE OIL. R. E. Thomas*. S. D. Rice. M. M. Babcock. and A. Moles*. California State University, Chico and NMFS Auke Bay, AK. Coho salmon smolts accumulated up to 30 times more hydrocarbon in selected tissues than did coho salmon jacks when exposed to water-soluble fraction of Cook Inlet crude oil. Aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity continued to increase during 12 days of exposure in coho smolts in contrast to jacks in which AHH activity peaked at 2 days and remained elevated during 20 days of exposure. Cytochrome P-450 concentrations peaked in 48 hr and returned to control levels in exposed smolts. In exposed and control jacks, cytochrome P-450 decreased during the 20 day experimental period. Concentrations of P-450 were significantly greater; however, in exposed jacks than in control jacks. Aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity and cytochrome P-450 concentrations were greater in non-exposed coho smolts and jacks than in non- exposed pre-spawning adults. Coho jacks were not as responsive as coho smolts in terms of P-450 induction, however they were more responsive than anticipated for a fish in a terminal life stage. 5 70 SULFIDE TOLERANCE AND DETOXIFICATION IN SHALLOW-WATER MARINE FISHES. Teoflora Baganna.0*, Russell D. Vetter and George N. Somero. Marine Biology Research Division, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, La Jolla, CA. Results of sulfide tolerance tests, assays of cytochrome oxidase and sulfide oxidase activities, and chromatography of sulfur compounds in the tissues of several species of shallow-water marine fishes indicate biochemical adaptations to sulfide which differed in extent according to habitat and lifestyle. Inner bay inhabitants like Gillichthys mirabilis and Fundulus parvipinnis have higher tolerance to sulfide (up to 20 h at 1 mM, or longer at lower concentrations) relative to outer bay, open coast and/or seagrass-bed inhabitants. The cytochrome oxidase of these species is susceptible to sulfide poisoning, with complete inhibition at 0.5-1 jxM. Tissues of fish killed by sulfide have much reduced or no cytochrome oxidase activity. The species studied have sulfide oxidase activity in the blood, kidney, spleen, liver and gills, which tends to increase with exposure to sulfide. Thiosulfate appears in the blood, kidney and spleen of sulfide-exposed fish, and builds up to high concentrations with longer or stronger exposure. Freshly-caught specimens have no or very little thiosulfate in the tissues. Sulfide does not occur in the tissues in any appreciable level at any time. It thus appears that fishes detoxify sulfide by oxidizing it to thiosulfate. 571 VARIATION IN SYNTHESIS OF TESTICULAR DNA DURING THE MOLT CYCLE OF MACROBRACHIUM ROSENBERGII (DECAPODA, PALAEMONIDAE). D. Cohen, A. Sagi, L. Karp, and Y\_ Milner. Hebrew University, Jerusalem. The relationship between molting and spermatogenesis was examined in two morphotypes of the freshwater prawn, Macrobachium rosenbergii, the repro- ductively active blue claw male and the frequently molting orange claw male. Testes from the two morphotypes were dissected and cultured in vitro. The rate of DNA synthesis (P"HJ thymidine incorporation) was recorded, and con? firmed by an autoradiographic analysis. A strong correlation between the in? corporation rate and the molt state was found. The blue claw males, which rarely molt, were all intermolt stage C4 and the incorporation rate into the testes was relatively low. The incor? poration rate in premolt orange claw males was at least three times higher than in postmolt and intermolt orange claw and blue claw prawns. The corre? lation between DNA synthesis in the testes and the cyclic changes in titers of molt-regulating hormones suggests that these hormones directly or indi- rectly participate in the regulation of spermatogenesis. 572 HORMONAL REGULATION OF DNA. SYNTHESIS IN THE LARVAL FAT BODY OF SPODOPTERA LlTURA (NoctuidaejLepidoptera). C? Lakehmi Puntambckar and Aparna Ray?(intro D.F.Baer). Univ. of Kyderabad, Kyderabad, INDIA. DNA synthesis leading to polyploidy has evolved for the case production of proteins required during metamorphosis. During larval development hormones influence the ability of the fat body to synthesize DNA. Results of ligation experiments performed on the early last instar larvae suggest that DNA synthesis in the fat body is dependent on factors originating in the anterior part of the larvae. We studied the effect of topical application of juve? nile hormone (JH-1) and injections of brain homogenate (BH) or 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-ONE) into early last instar of Spodo- ptera litura. Only JH-1 application increased the total and specific activities of DNA synthesized in the fat body of ligated insects, Autoradiographic studies revealed that there is a high degree of polyploidy in the fat body cells during larval development. Our data shows that JH-1 is necessary for fat body DNA synthe? sis and increased levels of ploidy during larval development.</page><page sequence="105">Abstracts 105A 573 PGI-GENOTYPE ALTERS METABOLIC CARBON FLUX AT LOW TEMPERATURE IN SEA ANEMONES. W.E. ZAMER and R.J. HQFFMANN*. Iowa State Univ. Ames . Frequencies of two alleles (f, s) for phosphoglucose isomerase (Pgi) vary clin- ally in populations of the sea anemone Metridium senile on the U.S. east coast. Based on the following observations we have tested a thermal selection hypothesis for maintenance of the variation. Frequen? cy of the s allele increases with declin- ing water temperature. Kinetic data show ss allozymes may direct more carbon to the pentose shunt pathway at lower temperature than ff allozymes. Acclimated measurements were made of pentose shunt C-flux in fed and fasted anemones of each genotype at 5 and 15C, by incubating tissues in H-glu- cose and ^C-l- or 1ZvC-6-glucose. Pgi did not alter fraction of glucose oxidation that occurs in the shunt in fasted anemones at 5 or 15C (2.5%), or in fed anemones at 15C (3.3%). However, in fed anemones at 5C shunt oxidation of glucose is ordered by Pgi (ss:7.0%; fs:6.1%; ff:5.5%; P&lt;0.035), as predicted by the hypothesis. Moreover, oxidation rates of ^C-glucose in the shunt in freshly-collected anemones at 15C (near ambient) are similar to those in fed anemones at 15C. We conclude that at lower temperature NADPH production (and synthetic capacity) may be affected by Pgi variation. 574 EFFECTS OF ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION IN ALGAL-CNIDARIAN SYMBIOSES: BIOCHEMICAL RESPONSE AND PRODUCTIVITY OF ZOOXANTHELLAE. M.P. LESSER. UNIV. OF MAINE, ORONO. Cultured zooxanthellae, and freshly isolated zooxanthellae from the sea anemone Aiptasia pallida show compensatory responses to changes in irradiance, ultraviolet radiation (UV), and the production of active forms of oxygen when acclimated under laboratory conditions. Activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase show significant increases with irradiance and UV. UV also decreases photosynthetic capacity and enhances the photoinhibition observed at high irradiances without UV. Zooxanthellae from symbiotic cnidarians freshly collected from various photic environments were examined to test whether the laboratory model is predictive. Although considerable variation exists, significant differences in SOD, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase were observed among high and low light populations, which suggests that the protection against active oxygen forms may result in a decrease in productivity in high light populations. The production of toxic oxygen forms could also be a potential mechanism mediating the recent bleaching observed on Caribbean coral reefs.

M. Shick. and J. P. S. Smith. III Univ. of Maine, Orono, and Univ. of North Carolina, Charlotte. Specific activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were determined for A. pallida and A.pulchella acclimated to subsaturating (25-35 u.E-m'^-s"1) and saturating (350-425 jiE-m"2^"1) irradiances. The activities of SOD and CAT were determined for aposymbiotic A. pulchella acclimated to ambient, 0.5 Atm., and 1.0 Atm. P02- SOD activity was not regulated in response to acclimation irradiance or exposure to hyperoxia. CAT activity did not vary with acclimation K)2, but was inversely related to acclimation irradiance, probably owing to its photoinactivation. The primary defense against oxidative stress in Aiptasia spp. may be high concentrations of uric acid, a hydroxyl radical scavenger. Exposure of symbiotic anemones to high irradiance + UV light increases their concentrations of uric acid. Aposymbiotic anemones have 9-fold lower urate levels. Membrane-bounded granules are present in zooxanthella-containing cells of A.pulchella, and are believed to contain urate. These data suggest that uric acid functions as an antioxidant in these anemones.

G.M.Scelfo. Univ. of California, Santa Cruz, CA. The concentration of UV-B (280- 340 nm) absorbing compounds (S-320) in tropical reef building corals is known to have a strong positive correlation with sunlight exposure. Anthopleura elegantissima, a tem? perate, intertidal anemone contains analogous material having absorp? tion maxima at 306 and 330 nm. The production of this material appears not to be photoregulated nor to be correlated with the presence of endosymbiotic zooxanthellae. The effects of visible and UV solar radiation on UV compound production were studied by comparing symbio? tic, sun adapted to aposymbiotic, shade adapted clones and by trans- planting anemones from both clones to aquariums with controlled light regimes. The four experimental light regimes included the full solar spectrum, visible light only, UV-A, and darkness. The results showed no difference in initial concentration between sun and shade adapted anemones and no significant change after 6 months for either clone in any of the light regimes.</page><page sequence="106">106A American Society of Zoologists 577 PURIFICATION OFA MULTICATALYTIC PROTEINASE FROM LOBSTER MUSCLE. Donald L. Mvkles. Colorado State University, Fort Collins. A multicatalytic proteinase (MCP) was purified over 3000-fold from lobster claw and abdominal muscles using ammonium sulfate fractionation (45-65% saturation), heating at 60 ?C for 3 min, arginine- Sepharose chromatography, and HPLC ion exchange chromatography (Mono Q column) with yields of about 60%. About 1.12 mg MCP was obtained for every 100 g tissue. MCP was extracted from muscle homogenates in a latent form; heating activated the enzyme while denaturing about 60% of the protein. Latent MCP was purified using the same protocol, except that the thermal activation step was omitted. Activated MCP degraded 14C-methylcasein as well as synthetic peptide sybstrates of trypsin and chymotrypsin. Both forms were composed of 8 subunits (24 to 32 kDa); no differences between active and latent forms were observed with two- dimensional gel electrophoresis. Activity was suppressed with various inhibitors of serine proteases and sulfhydryl blocking reagents but not with Ep-475, a specific inhibitor of cysteine proteases; this suggests lobster MCP is a serine proteinase with sulfhydryl groups not part of the active site that are essential for catalysis. The enzyme degraded myofibrillar proteins but with much less efficacy than calcium-dependent proteinases also isolated from the same tissue (J. Biol. Chem. ??1,9865-9871), suggesting MCP plays a secondary role in turnover of contractile proteins. Supported by NSF (DCB-8617386). 578 AN ARTICULATE BRACHIOPOD WITH TAUROPINE DEHYDROGENASE. CS. Hammen and S.C. Woodbury. Univ. Rhode Island, Kingston. A newly discovered (1986), but ancient (Archeogastropoda) enzyme, tauropine de? hydrogenase (TDH) catalyzes the reductive condensation of pyruvate and taurine, coupled with the oxidation of reduced NAD. The product has been called tauro? pine, by analogy with octopine and octopine dehydrogenase, which serves in the metabolic role of lactate dehydro? genase (LDH) in marine invertebrates with little LDH activity. TDH was recently reported in the pedicle of the small lingulid brachiopod Glottidia pyramidata. In tissue extracts of the articulate brachiopod Laqueus californianus (Terebratulacea), TDH proved to be the major dehydrogenase, 83 percent of the sum of LDH and all opine dehydrogenase activities, with alanopine dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.17) at 12 percent. This was similar to the pattern of activities in Glottidia, TDH 92 percent, ADH 6.5 per? cent. Both fast and slow adductor muscle of the oyster Crassostrea virginica con? tained a small but definite fraction of TDH activity. 579 ENERGY METABOLISM OF THE SOUTHERN OYSTER DRILL, THAIS HAEMASTOMA DURING SALINITY ADAPTATION. Li-Lian Liu and ff. B. Stickle. Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge. The 28-day median tolerance of salinity (LC-50) of Thals haemastoma was determined in three populations, Red Fish Bay, TX, Barataria Bay, LA, and Pensacola Bay, FL. The low salinity LC-50 ranges from 3.5 (FL) to 7.1 o/ooS (TX). The high salinity LC-50 varies from 44.4 (LA) to 51.5 o/ooS (TX). The energetic cost associated with salinity adaptation was determined as heat flux using both open- flow and closed microcalorimetry systems. Normoxic heat flux was recorded continu? ously at the acclimation salinity for 24 hours and then at the transfer salinity for 96 hours. In both low to high (10 to 30 o/ooS) and high to low (30 to 10 o/ooS) salinity transfers, heat flux was decreased to 20% of the acclimation rate in the early stage followed by a gradual recovery to the acclimation rate after 10 to 24 hours. Anoxic heat flux was also recorded for 24 hours in each salinity transfer. In the 10 to 30 o/ooS group, heat flux nearly doubled during early transfer and returned to the acclimation rate. However, anoxic heat flux did not change significantly in the 30 to 10 o/ooS transfer. 580 ENERGETICS OF SALINITY ADAPTATION BY THE MILKFISH, CHANOS CHANOS; EFFECTS ON ROUTINE OXYGEN CONSUMPTION AND ACTIVITY. C^ Swanson. Univ. of California, Los Angeles. Routine oxygen consumption rates and activity of juvenile milkfish, Chanos chanosf acclimated to three salinities (15, 33, 55 ppt) were measured at 2 6?C in an annular respirometer. Oxygen consumption increased with swimming speed. Activity levels varied within and among fish but not among salinities (0.9+0.2 body lengths see""1) . At this speed, oxygen consumption rates of fish in 15 ppt (0.108+0.015 mg 02 g"1 h"1) were significantly lower than those of fish in 33 and 55 ppt (0,148+0.030 and 0.146+0.041 mg 02 g h~r, respectively). There was no difference between oxygen consumption rates of fish in 33 and 55 ppt. Higher rates in 3 3 and 55 ppt may reflect increased energetic costs associated with osmoregulation. The similarity of routine swimming speeds suggests that milkfish do not compensate for higher maintenance costs by reductions in activity.</page><page sequence="107">Abstracts 107A 581 REGIONAL 3H-WATER EXCHANGE IN AMPHIBIA: EFFECT OF DEHYDRATION.

Univ. of Tasmania, Hobart, Australia 7001. Litoria caerulea is the most widely distributed tree frog in Australia whereas L_j_ chloris is restricted to a relatively small area of coastal rain- forest. Evaporative water loss was eval- uated for each species over the tempera? ture interval 25-50 ?C using a flow- through chamber. Area-specific water loss rates of L_j_ chloris were about 3- times lower than those of L^. caerulea from 25-35 ?C but were indistinguishable at the highest temperature. This pattern was reflected by differences in cutan? eous resistance to water flux as a function of temperature for these spe? cies. In Lij. chloris, these resistances remained about 10-fold greater than those measured for N. American arboreal frogs from 25-37 ?C but declined direct? ly with higher temperatures. Skin re? sistance values for L^. caerulea were about one-fourth those of h^ chloris at air temperatures below 37 ?C but no dif? ferent at temperatures above 45 ?C.

Brust and M.R. Preest. Cornell University, Ithaca. Hyla arenicolor regularly bask in the hot desert sun above pools of water for up to 4 hr without rehydrating. Daytime body temperatures can exceed 33 C and frogs can accrue water deficits of at least 19% of standard mass. The animals are relatively inactive during the day and perch high on canyon walls. At night frogs will forage up to 35 m from a source of water. To determine the effects of temperature and hydration state on aerobic metabolism, we measured resting and active oxygen consumption at 20 and 30 C for fully hydrated animals and for those with a 20% water deficit. Hydration state did not affect rates of resting or active oxygen consumption at 20 C. However, an interactive effect of body temperature and hydration state was apparent at 30 C. At this temperature active rates of oxygen consumption were reduced by 36% in dehydrated as compared with fully hydrated animals. These results emphasize the importance of controlling for both hydration state and temperature when measuring amphibian performance. H. arenicolor may tolerate high body temperatures and water deficits in order to avoid aquatic predators. 584 OSMOREGULATION AND KIDNEY FUNCTION DURING AVIAN EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT: CHRONIC RENA] INSUFFICIENCY. M.J. Murphy and N.B. Clark, SUNY at Cobleskill and Univ. of Connect? icut, Storrs. Chronic renal insufficiency continues to be a significant contributor to neo? natal death in humans and other amniote vertebrates. We examined the consequences of unilateral renal agenesis on water content, hematocrit and allantoic fluid volume of Day 14 chick embryos and meso- nephric pathology of the remaining con? tralateral kidney of Day 16 embryos. The insertion of a small piece of eggshell membrane into the lateral body wall of Day 2 embryos resulted in unilateral re? nal agenesis in over 80% of operated an? imals. Embryos thus altered had severely reduced allantoic fluid volume (34% of controls) and also exhibited a marked edema; water content of operated embryos was 89.4% + 0.1% compared to 86.2 + 0.6% in controls. This increase in water con? tent of operated embryos may have re? sulted in hemodulition and volume expan- sion since the hematocrit of these em? bryos was lowered by 8% compared to con? trols and renal corpuscular and tubular components were grossly expanded. It is presently unclear whether compensatory renal growth occurs in these embryos.</page><page sequence="108">108A American Society of Zoologists 585 THE EFFECTS OF WATER DEPRIVATION ON RENAL FUNCTION IN GAMBEL'S QUAIL (CALLIPEPLA GAMBELII). Jos. B. Williams* and E. ?. Braun. University of Arizona, Tucson. Tubular reabsorption varies in some birds depending on the state of hydration while the rate of glomerular filtration (GFR) remains constant; other studies report that GFR declines in response to water deprivation. Using osmotic minipumps filled with ^C-polyethylene glycol, we measured GFR and urine flow rate (UFR) in unanesthetized, unrestrained Gambel's Quail during normal hydration (NH) and after 4-5 days of water deprivation (WD). WD birds lost 14.7% of their body mass. GFR declined from 16.2 ml/hr in NH birds to 8.2 ml/hr in WD birds and UFR dropped from .450 ml/hr to .160 ml/hr. Though plasma osmolality increased, levels of plasma Na+ and K+ remained unchanged. For WD birds, U/P ratios averaged 1.6. Hence, during water restriction Gambel's Quail defend their body water volume by lowering their GFR and consequent UFR.

Spring, Univ. of Southwestern Louisiana,Lafayette. Adenylate cyclase activity of Malpig- hian tubules in response to stimulation was assayed using a commercially available RIA kit (Amersham International). The assay was optimized for use in this sys? tem. Critical factors were determination of incubation time and control of free calcium levels using an EGTA-Ca buffer. The number of 'assays performed with a kit could be doubled over that recommended by the manufacturer with no decrease in accu- racy. Corpora cardiaca (CC) homogenates were found to increase cAMP levels in vitro. Activation of adenylate cyclase by CC occurred even at 0? C, therefore, assay tubes were incubated in small batches and strictly timed. HPLC fractions of CC homo? genates known to alter secretion rate were then assayed to identify factors affecting adenylate cyclase activity in the tubules. The ionophore A23187 was used to investi- gate the role of calcium in secretion with a separate, whole tubule bioassay. Suppor? ted in part by a GSO grant to T.M.

Univ. of Florida, Gainesville, FL Juveniles of the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii of 1 to 4 g molted at around 21 day intervals at 24?C. During the molting cycle the following physiological parameters were measuredj rate of Oo uptake (NOq) and C02 excretion (MC02), respiratory quotient (R) and net fluxes of Ca , aoparent H+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Cl", S0|", and P0|". M02 peaked (1.8X) 1-2 days prior to molting and fell to control levels within 2 days post-molt. Meanwhile MC02 doubled 1-2 days pre-molt increasing R from 1.2 to 1.4. For 4 days post- molt MC02 was significantly depressed, reduc- ing R to 0.6. Associated with these changes in C02 dynamics were net Ca2+ efflux and apparent H+ uptake (around 2500pequiv kg""1 rf *) for up to 4 days pre-molt. The direction- ality of these fluxes was reversed for 4 days after molting. Post-molt was accompanied by net uptake of Na+, Cl" and K* and increased efflux of Mg2+, S0|" and P0| . Na-depleted artificial medium marginally reduced post- molt Ca2+ uptake and significantly reduced apparent H+ excretion; similar effects were obtained in HCOo-free medium. Control fluxes were unaffected in Cl-free medium. (Supported by NSF DCB 84-15373) 588 VOLUME REGULATION IN SKATE RED BLOOD CELLS (RBC): NO ROLE FOR EICOSANOIDS. J.M. Martinez*, CA. Herman, and L. Goldstein. Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, Salsbury Cove, ME 04672. In response to hypotonic stress, skate RBC effect a volume regulatory decrease (RVD) by releasing organic solutes, e.g. taurine. This response is accompanied by a rise in production of diacylglcerol, which may then give rise to the arachi- donic cascade. Since eicosanoids play a role in volume regulation in some cells (Lambert et. al, J. Memb. Biol. 98: 247, 1987), we tested the effects of prosta? glandins (PG) and leukotrienes (LT) on skate RBC. RBC were prelabelled with 3H taurine in elasmobranch Ringer's solution 940 mOsm. Taurine efflux from control cells was 0.72 ? 0.20 umol/gm per 30 min. Addition of LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, PGE2, or PGF2* at 10-6 M had no significant ef? fect on taurine efflux. Indomethacin (10 -5 M), a cyclooxygenase inhibitor and quinacrine (10-5 M),a phospholipase A2 inhibitor, had no effects on the increase of taurine efflux in response to hypo? osmotic stress (650 mOsm). Preliminary experiments indicate that hypoosmotic stress does not affect the production of PG or LT.

Crangon crangon is a fast growing, short living Caridean shrimp species inhabit- ing West European coastal areas. Knowledge about the sexual cycle is incomplete. During this study 75 copulations of C. crangon has been observed and partially recorded. During copulation, the opening of one vas deferens is pressed against the opening of one oviduct. The spermatophore is emptied into the oviduct by contracting of the muscular vas deferens and sperm cells are spread over the entire inner sides of the oviduct . Fertilization is internal. Fertilization can be considerably later than insemination. Normally, males spawn only once and change sex after that. The relevance of sperm storage and the consequences of sex change will be discussed in connection with other aspects of the life cycle. 590 MATING, SPERM STORAGE AND CAPACITATION IN THE MARINE SHRIMP, SICYONIA INGENTIS. W.H.Clark, Jr, K.K. Keller*y K. Uhlinger*, and F.J. Griffin*. Bodega Marine Lab., U. Calif., Davis. S. ingentis females were induced to molt via eyestalk ablation. At ecdysis the seminal receptacles which are arthrodial membrane specializations are shed rendering a female "functional virginity." Post-molt females were introduced to males and monitored using a time lapse video. Recently molted females (&lt;24 hrs) participate in pre- mating behavior but do not copulate until they are at least 48 hrs post molt. At copulation seminal plasm is transferred to one or both seminal receptacles. S. ingentis sperm are not competent to undergo an acrosome reaction prior to transfer to and storage in a seminal receptacle. Sperm removed from seminal receptacles within 1-5 days of mating will undergo acrosomal exocytosis but not acrosomal filament formation. Sperm which have resided in a seminal recepticle for &gt;7 days, however, undergo both exocytosis and filament formation.

Cohen and J.G. Morin. U.C.L.A. Species of the marine ostracode Vargula show a remarkable radiation in the shallow waters of the Caribbean. Male swarms produce species- specific nocturnal luminescent mating displays (shown in videotapes) that are probably sexually isolating. Each of the more than 50 new species has a specific signaling pattern, a distinct reef habitat and apparently shows a restricted distribution. Taxonomic relationships were analyzed in a cladistic analysis of morphological characters. All signaling species are assigned to 2 nearly exclusively Caribbean, but only distantly related, clades. The larger of these clades comprises at least 5 monophyletic groups from the Caribbean and 1 apparently nondisplaying California species. 592 MULTIPLE MATING, SPERM STORAGE AND SPERM DISPLACEMENT IN A SPIDER CRAB. R. Diesel. Max-Planck- Institut fur Verhaltensphysio- logie, Seewiesen, F.R.A. Reproductive behavior and anato? mical design predispose spider crabs (Majidae) to the evolution of ejaculate competition mecha? nisms. In the spider crab Inachus phalangium females store sperm of promiscuous matings in highly specialized seminal receptacles. Sperm remain viable for several months and may be used for ferti? lization of up to six broods. Sperm from multiple matings are stored in discrete packets. Using H3-thymidine labelled sperm and autoradiography it is demonstrated that the last male to mate dis- places ejaculates of predecessors, while placing its own sperm closest to the fertilization site. The predecessors' sperm are shut off from the site of fertilization by means of a hardening seminal fluid. By using sterilized males it was confirmed that the last male to mate fertilizes virtually all eggs of the subsequent brood.</page><page sequence="110">110A American Society of Zoologists 593 LOBSTER MATING BEHAVIOR: EFFECTS OF VARYING SEX RATIOS ON INTRA SEXUAL COMPETITION. DF. Cowan. Boston University Marine Program, Woods Hole, MA. In large semi-natural aquaria, unrestricted female lobsters, Homarus americanus. initiated a brief (7-27 day) pair bond by making repeated approaches to a male shelter. Mating took place inside the male shelter approximately 1/2 hour after the female molted. Skewing the sex ratio toward females (5F/2M) resulted in a mating svstem of serial monogamy where the females staggered their molts throughout the summer to mate with the dominant male. Skewing the sex ratio toward males (2F/4M) resulted in intense aggression among males, but no persistent dominance was observed. Females cohabited inter - mittently with each of the four males and delayed both molting and mating until the end of the summer. Therefore, a successful, natural, field maling population probably maintains a functionally skewed sex ratio. with a greater number of receptive females than suitable males. 594 intermolt mating and insemination in PREOVIGEROUS AMERICAN LOBSTERS. S.L Waddv and D.E. Aiken. Biological Station, St. Andrews, NB Canada. Postmolt mating behavior has been well described for lobsters, but intermolt or pre- spawning mating was only recently recognized as a normal component of reproductive behav? ior. In experiments conducted over 3 yr, 122 intermolt matings were recorded on videotape. Intermolt insemination was found to occur routinely in unmated preovigerous females and apparently is a mechanism for ensuring the fertilization of spawned eggs. Egg attachment and incubation success are no different in females mated prior to spawning than in fe? males mated at molt. Incidence of intermolt mating was far greater in the 6 wk prior to the spawning season (100%) than in the win? ter and spring (30%). All but one intermolt mating occurred between the hours of 2200 and 0600. Males are usually able to discrimin- ate between non- and preovigerous females (100% of preovigerous females were mated, only 61% of non-preovigerous females were mated). Males will mate several times in one day with the same female if insemination is unsuccessful. Once insemination occurs, males usually show no further interest in the fe? male. However, multiple insemination (differ? ent males) occurs in about 10% of females. Some males display impressive mating capabil- ity; one inseminated 11 females in 16 days. 595 SIZE DEPENDENT DEMOGRAPHY OF THREE CARIBBEAN GORGONIANS: MAGNITUDE OF THE ESCAPE IN SIZE. H.R. LASKER. STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK, BUFFALO. The demography of experimental populations of the Caribbean gorgonians Plexaura homomalla. Plexaura sp. and Pseudoolexaura porosa is best described as a function of size. A common feature of such a demography is a marked escape from mortality with increasing size. The existence of the escape in size is often obvious, but the magnitude of the effect has rarely been measured. Measurements of colony growth rates, mortality and an indirect measure of grazing/predation were collected over 4 years in experimentally established populations in the San Blas Is., Panama. A steady-state model of population growth shows that small (0-5 cm total length) colonies have 10-100 times less chance of reaching reproductive size (&gt;20 cm) than intermediate size (10-15 cm) colonies. Species which produce large vegetative propagules can exploit the escape in size. Variance in the escape in size among the three species is only weakly correlated with , the relative incidence of vegetative propagation. This suggests that variation in the cost of producing successful propagules may have greater effects on fitness than the relative success of the propagules. 596 A SIZE-CLASS TRANSITION MATRIX MODEL OF CLONAL REPRODUCTION IN A FRAGMENTING SOFT CORAL. CS. McFadden. Univ. of Washington, Seattle. In the temperate soft coral, Alcyonium (?) sp.. mortality and sexual reproduction are both size- dependent processes that favor large colonies. Instead of growing to large size, however, these soft corals continually undergo fission to produce small daughter colonies, each of which has a high probability of mortality and a low probability of reproducing sexually. Demographical data collected over a two year period were used to construct a size-class transition matrix model of long-term population growth rates, with and without colony fission. Because yearly rates of larval recruitment are lower than the yearly probability of colony mortality, a population of soft corals which does not reproduce by clonal fission will go extinct before producing one surviving sexual recruit. Fission spreads the risk of genet mortality.</page><page sequence="111">Abstracts 111A 597 POPULATION DYNAMICS OF AN OCTOCORAL: SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL PATTERNS Kenneth P. Sebens. Northeastern University, Marine Science Center, Nahant, MA 01908 Populations of the northwest Atlantic octocoral Alcyonium siderium were studied at seven sites over eight years, comparing size-dependent mortality, growth rates, and recruitment. Although some year to year variation in growth occurs, there are clear differences between sites along a gradient of water movement, with highest growth rates and greatest mortality rates in locations with more flow. Spatial isolation of the populations leads to radically different local mortality events due to the growth and movement of urchin herds, the introduction of a new nudi- branch species, and local temperature anomalies. Spatial distribution of the popula? tions combined with positive density- dependent population dynamics produces in? dependent populations whose local history is of overriding importance. 598 GE2UTIPLC EdVEKSIIY WTIHIN AND BEHWEEN HA&amp;&amp;HAN KKL'ltS OCMEKESSft PCEULKTICNS WHH DTFFERENT DISIURBANCE HESKKDES.

Clonal replication of established genotypes will effect the estimated and actual levels of genetic variation in natural popula? tions. Genotypic diversity was electrcphore- tically assayed in six pop.ilat.ions of the scleractinian coral, Farites catpressa. Diver? sity was inversely related to age and distur- bance history of populations. A recently recruited site (&lt;10 years old) recovering frcm intense alsturbance had the hicjiest genotypic diversity; a very old population (ICr to 104 years) in a physically benign envixonxnent had the lowest. Internediately disturbed sites had internediate levels of genotypic diversity. cver-all genetic variation is hicji in this long-lived species, despite lcw annual rates of sexual recruitiiient.

Maine, Darling Center, Walpole and Univ. Washington, Friday Harbor Crustose algae have long been recognized as a dominant growth form on hard substrata throughout the photic zone. They are found among the three major algal divisions (Chlorophyta, Phaeophyta, Rhodophyta), lichens and cyanobacteria. Among these groups, the calcified, red, crustose corallines are most abundant and occupy the widest range of habitats. Why? Our studies indicate that the success of encrusting corallines may be related to the degree of physiological integration found in these plants due to translocation. This probably occurs via intercellular conduits called secondary pits and cell fusions. This integration allows them to "behave" clonally in ways analogous to many herbaceous plants, bryozoans and corals. Our studies also suggest that growth rates, wound-healing, and resistance to the lethal effects of overgrowth are facilitated by this physiological integration. Vertical translocation may allow corallines to maintain thick thalli which are resistant to the damaging effects of deep-grazing herbivores. These anatomical and morphological characters allow corallines to dominate heavily grazed habitats. 600 INDUCIBLE MORPHOLOGY, HETEROCHRONY AND INTRASPECIFIC COMPETITION IN A MARINE BRYOZOAN. CD. Harvell and D.K. Padilla. Cornell Univ., Ithaca, N.Y. Stolons are produced by Membranipora membranacea against smaller conspecifics within 48 hours of colony contact. Both absolute and relative size of interacting colonies determine whether stolons will be produced. While individual stolons are eventually overgrown by conspecifics, they reduce growth of affected zooids by 27%. Reproduction of both large and small colonies is accelerated in the contact region. We suggest that stolons function to limit space occupied by small colonies and to accelerate them into early reproduction. Stolons appear to be juvenilized zooids and thus originate through a process of heterochrony.</page><page sequence="112">112A American Society of Zoologists 601 CAUSES OF LIFE HISTORY VARIATION IN A PHILOPATRIC SPECIES TIGRIOPUS CALIFORNICUS (COPEPODA: HARPAC- TICOIDA) IN DIFFERENT ENVIRON? MENTS. M.F. Dybdahl. University of California, Davis, CA. Geographic variation in selection often leads to corresponding patterns of phenotypic variation. Whether genetic variation or phenotypic plasticity has evolved in response to spatial variation in selection depends critically on levels of gene flow between environments. However few studies compare causes of variation and levels of gene flow. I studied life history variation in populations of a philopatric marine tidepool copepod Tigriopus californicus that inhabitat two different selective regimes (constant versus variable salinity) at Bodega Bay, CA. Because the spatial scale of selective regimes is in concordance with the spatial scale of genetic structure, I expected that populations would exhibit local adaptation and different levels of plasticity. Common garden experiments showed no significant genetic differentiation between these populations, but extensive plasticity, for major fitness-related traits. Preliminary measurements of allozyme frequencies suggests that two of the populations experience little gene exchange. The lack of local adaptation suggests that plasticity incurs no costs and is favored in both types of environments. 602 SOME SEASONAL PATTERNS IN THE REPRODUCTIVE ECOLOGY AND LIFE HISTORY OF A TEMPERATE MANTIS SHRIMP. L^ Baaoh and JJL EoglSL. Catalina Marine Science Center, and The Tatman Foundation, Avalon, CA. Hemisquilla ensigera califomiensiK is a large, reclusive stomatopod which burrows in subtidal soft substrata. Reproductive and life history patterns were studied by intensive surveying of populations at Santa Catalina Is., CA. from 1983 to present. In situ video and laboratory work provided information on reproductive state and related behavior. Seasonally, populations exhibit an intersexual difference in observable activities. In fall a near- balanced sex ratio is apparent, but in 6pring females remain unseen in plugged burrows for days to weeks, while males keep burrows open longer, continue excursions from them, and ornament their entrances. In spring, animals follow one another closely and cohabit a burrow. Females presumably spawn and brood egg masses during their prolonged burrow occupancy. Oogeneeis occurs in winter. By April, previously non- reproductive females were inseminated and had enlarged ovaries containing orange, unripe eggs. Early stage planktonic larvae were collected in July. Numerous small postlarvae with burrows appeared annually in November. Recruitment appears to occur in late summer or early fall. 603 COLOR POLYMORPHISM IN THE MEADOW SPITTLEBUG. E.D. McCoy (intro. by D. Wilson). Univ. of South Florida, Tampa. Color polymorphism in the meadow spittlebug has a genetic basis, but environment contributes to observed phenotypic variability. I studied the distribution of color morphs of the spittlebug in relation to elevation in the southern Appalachian Mountains. The frequencies of some morphs declined with increasing eleva? tion; on average, spittlebugs were darker at higher elevations. Color morphs tended to be unequally distributed between sexes at any elevation; on average, females were darker than males. The decline in the frequencies of some morphs with elevation was accompanied by a shift from strongly female- dominated to more equitable sex ratios. As genotypic expression may be related in some cases to sex, differences in sex ratios among populations of the meadow spittlebug may, in part, explain differences in the frequencies of morphs with elevation. 604 QUANTITATIVE GENETICS OF DAILY TORPOR IN PEROMYSCUS: CALCULATION OF THE INTRA-CLASS CORRELATION COEFFICIENT. L. K. Wang. Clemson Univ., S.C. Individual Peromyscus show great variation in ability to enter ration induced torpor. To determine whether this variation has a heritable basis, and is thus susceptible to natural selection, quantitative measurements of characters describing torpor (duration, miniraura temperature, and torpor index) in five sibships of size four were taken. A computerized electronic data collection system and surgically implanted temperature- sensitive radio transmitters were used. Calculation of the intra-class correlation coefficent indicates that further investigation into the heritability of the characters, as measured by parent-offspring regressions, are worthy of pursuit.</page><page sequence="113">Abstracts 113A 605 FIELD COMPARISONS OF PLANKTOTROPHIC AND LECITHOTROPHIC STREBLOSPIO LARVAE: IMPLICATIONS FOR DISPERSAL, RECRUITMENT AND POPULATION DYNAMICS. LA. Levin and D.V. Huggett*. North Carolina State Univ., Raleigh. We have studied the occurrence of planktotrophy and lecithotrophy in Streblospio benedicti inhabiting Bogue Sound, NC for the past 2 1/2 years to evaluate population-level implications of larval development mode. Combined studies of larval swimming behavior, larval availability in the plankton, potential for transport and larval colonization patterns indicate that planktotrophic S. benedicti larvae should experience greater dispersal distances than lecithotrophic larvae in Bogue Sound. Planktotrophic larvae abound in the water column, while lecithotrophic remain on or near the bottom. Studies of two local demes, one dominated by planktotrophs, the other b y lecithotrophs, suggest that dispersal differences associated with development mode do not influence recruitment patterns or population size structure in Streblospio. However, density differences between the two sites may be tied to development mode. Experimental results suggest that very different patterns of larval availability, behavior and survivorship associated with planktotrophy and lecithotrophy maintain spatial heterogeneity in development of Streblospio at various field sites but can lead to similar population dynamics. 606 RECRUITMENT, ABUNDANCE, AND REPRODUCTIVE MORPHOLOGY IN TWO SPECIES OF COLONIAL ASCIDIANS. &amp; Cohen, Univ. of Washington, Seattle. Two species of colonial ascidians at the same field site show striking differences in patterns of recruitment and abundance. Distaplia occidentalis shows strong seasonal variation in abundance, low space coverage, and a relatively high recruitment rate. Didemnum (?) sp. shows less seasonal variation, high space coverage, and very low recruitment. These differences between species may be explained by variation in reproductive morphology which may limit reproductive output in one species. Allocation to sexual reproduction in Didemnum ? sp, may be limited by the individual zooid's ability to ventilate its own brood sac. In contrast, D. occidentalis brood sacs may detach from the zooid and migrate to the tunic surface where they are ventilated by the entire colony. 607 TURBULENT TRANSPORT OF MARINE LARVAE NEAR ROCKY SHORES. M.A.R. Koehli , T.M. Powell*2, and T.L. Daniel. Univ. of California, 1Berkeley, 2Davis, CA, and 3Univ. of Washington, Seattle, WA. The transport of larvae by moving water to and from the shore on spatial scales of centimeters to tens of meters is poorly understood. We used dye- release techniques to measure water advection and horizontal turbulent mixing at a variety of rocky shore sites. Although water velocities in waves often exceeded 5 m/s, speeds of dye advection were low (0.09-0.77 m/s). Turbulent diffusivities varied between lxl0~4 and 8x10*2 m.2/s. Our results indicate that: 1) short-lived larvae are more likely to be lost at sites exposed to rapid currents than at sites exposed to waves; 2) long- lived larvae at both such sites are advected away, but in protected kelp beds are dispersed by turbulent diffusion; 3) the height of larval release above the substratum makes little difference to transport away from a parent in waves. 608 COMPETENCY AND DISPERSAL 0F SPAWNED VERSUS BROODED CORAL PLANULA LARVAE. R.H. Richmond. Marine Laboratory, Univ. of Guam, Mangilao, Guam. The coral families Acroporidae and Pocilloporidae are important scler- actinian taxa present on reefs through? out much of the Pacific Ocean. Genera in these two families can be considered among the most successful scleractinians in terms of diversity or distribution. The genus Acropora is notable as the most diverse group, with over 200 species, while the genus Pocillopora is represented by less than 10 species. Pocillopora exhibits a pan-Pacific dis? tribution, while Acropora has failed to pass through certain biogeographic "filters" or barriers, and exhibits a higher degree of endemism. Acropora tenuis spawns its gametes once a year on the reefs of Guam, Mariana Islands. Pocillopora damicornis broods its larvae, which are released monthly on reefs throughout the Central and Indo- West Pacific. A comparison of larval energetics between these two species reveals a predicted competency period of 20 days for A. tenuis planulae, versus 100 days for P_. damicornis larvae. This five-fold differential may explain the observed difference in biogeographical distribution between these two species.</page><page sequence="114">114A American Society of Zoologists 609 OFF-SHORE UPWELLING AND LIMITS TO DISPERSAL AND RECHJTTMENT OF CANCER SP. (DECAPODA, BRACHYURA) IN NORTHERN MQNTEREY BAY. W.M. Graham (intro. by D.C. Potts). Institute of Marine Sciences, Univ. of California, Santa Cruz. Ekman pumping of cold intermediate water out of the Monterey submarine canyon may produce a convergence zone strong enough to prevent on-shore movement of late stage larvae of Cancer sp. During the larval period of Cancer from early March to late May, I took plankton transects at 2-3 week intervals plus seasonal Conductivity, Tenperature, and Depth (CTD) casts. Early stage zoeae tended to move off-shore while later stage zoeae and megalopae tended to move in-shore. The in-shore movement halted consistently at a semi- permanent convergence zone about 6.5 km from the beach that was associated with upwelling about 3 km further out. Upwelling was not wind induced. 610 PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS AND BEHAVIORAL CHANGES IN DEVELOPING LARVAE OF PENAEID SHRIMP. Jill K. Hahn. Penaeid larvae increase their size by an order of magnitude from hatching to the first postlarval stage. At the same time they undergo changes in body shape and in limb number. These changes affect the properties of their interaction with the fluid environment. In this study, high speed cinematography, video microscopy, and laser optics are used to characterize patterns of limb movement and flow fields for the larvae of two species of penaeid shrimp (Penaeus merguiensis and ?. plebejus). Comparisons are made between different developmental stages of a single species, and among similar stages of the two species. Using this approach, it is possible to tease apart physical constraints imposed by the medium from behavioral changes that occur as the larva develops. 612 CONSTRAINTS TO FEEDING PERFORM? ANCE IN THE HORN SHARK AND THE WHITESPOTTED BAMBOOSHARK E. H. Wu. Harvard University, Cambridge, MA. Feeding in the horn shark, Heterodontus francisci, and the whitespotted bambooshark, Chiloscyllium plagiosum, was investigated with high speed video and electromyography. H. francisci and C. plagiosum are members of the closely allied Heterodontiformes and Orectolobiformes within the superorder Galeomorphi. These sharks generate suction for prey capture primarily via two bio? mechanical pathways: a dorsal coupling for chondrocranial elevation and a ventral coupling where mandibular depression and rapid expansion of the oropharyngeal cavity are produced by hyoid depression and retraction. The hypothesis that these two couplings are primitive for vertebrates thus appears to be true for elasmobranchs. Constraints on performance in prey capture and processing were examined to ask whether emphasis on one aspect of feeding limits the performance of another aspect. The horn shark design focusses on generating force during prey processing and the bambooshark design is for suction feeding. Their cephalic morphology differs primarily in the manner in which the palatoquadrate, or upper jaw, is suspended from the cranium. 613 KINEMATICS OF JAW PROTRUSION IN CHEILINE WRASSES (LABRIDAE): TESTING A FOUR BAR LINKAGE MODEL. M.W. WESTNEAT DUKE UNIVERSITY The feeding apparatus of teleost fishes is modelled as two planar four bar linkages. One linkage involves the opercle series and lower jaw, as has been proposed previously. A second linkage consists of the lower jaw, maxilla, palatine, and pre- maxilla. The model exists as a PASCAL computer program which accepts morphometric data on bone and muscle dimensions, and calculates the geometry and positional relationships of every structure in the linkage system. An input (muscle contraction) is simulated, from which the model predicts kine? matics of each element in motion during a feeding event. The model is tested with wrasses of genus Cheilinus, by manipulating the jaws of fresh speci? mens and by analyzing high speed (200 fr/sec) films of feeding events. The model accurately pre? dicts kinematic variables during feeding, including the movements of opercle rotation, lower jaw rotation, maxilla rotation, premaxillary protrusion, and gape. I conclude that a four bar linkage model accurately predicts kinematics of Cheilinus feeding from structural data. The model should be applic- able to a diversity of fish taxa, and it's strength is that predictions derived from it are readily subject to test.

University of California, Irvinc. The tongue-bite between the basihyal and skull in osteoglossomorph fishes represents a novel component of the feeding mechanism, intercalated between the mandibular and pharyngeal jaws. In order to understand the role of this system during feeding, we studied the functional morphology of the tongue bite in Notopterus. Anatomically, the tongue-bite of osteoglossomorphs is specialized relative to outgroup taxa (such as Amia) in having well- developed basihyal, suspensorial, and parasphenoid teeth. Kinematic and electromyographic analyses of prey processing reveal that the tongue-bite is used in two major functional processes: raking, and open mouth chewing, both of which maceratc the prey. During raking, the head is elevated and the hyobranchial apparatus moves posteroventrally, while the lower jaw is fixed in position by activity of the adductor mandibulae. During open mouth chewing, neurocranial elevation is reduced, and lower jaw depression occurs con- comitantly with posteroventral hyoid motion. During both raking and open mouth chewing there is almost no activity of the sternohyoideus muscle. We suggest that the lack of sternohyoideus activity during prey processing is derived as compared to primitive actinopterygians. 615 PHYSIOLOGICAL BASES OF FEEDING BEHAVIOR IN SALAMANDERS: DO MOTOR PATTERNS VARY WITH PREY TYPE? S. M. Reillv and G. V. Lauder University of California, Irvine Muscle activity patterns (motor patterns) of the jaw musculature of all vertebrates studied to date (primarily fishes and amniotes) show considerable qualitative and quantitative variation when they feed on different types of prey. Previous data on buccal pressure patterns suggested that feeding in the aquatic salamander, Ambystoma mexicanum, is highly stereotyped. This hypothesis was tested by quantifying the motor pattern used during feeding on two prey types: earthworms and guppies. Twenty-nine variables were measured from the activity pattern of six cranial muscles in the feeding mechanism of Ambystoma mexicanum. These variables included the area under the electromyogram of each muscle, relative muscle onset times, and the amplitudes and durations of muscle bursts. Both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses demonstrate that the feeding motor pattern of Ambystoma mexicanum is stereotyped and does not change with prey type. Individual salamanders use significantly different motor patterns from one another during feeding, but in contrast to motor patterns of other vertebrates studied to date, they do not alter their motor pattern while feeding on different prey.

Harvard Univ., Cambridge, and Univ. of Calif., Berkeley. Physical constraints imposed by the viscosity of the feeding medium (air or water) have largely determined mechanisms of tetrapod feeding. Aquatic vertebrates use suction almost universally to move prey into and through the oral cavity. Terrestrial species rely on the jaws and especially the tongue for food capture and transport. Lingual ingestion characterizes all terrestrial salamanders. All aquatic salamanders studied heretofore use some form of suction feeding. High speed films reveal that fully aquatic Leurognathus marmoratus utilizes a terrestrial feeding mechanism (lingual projection and transport) under water. Closely related, but terrestrial, Desmognathus quadramaculatus uses the jaws to seize prey under water and tongue projection out of water. Kinematics of Leurognathus lingual feeding are similar to those reported for terrestrial desmognathines (mean capture sequence 128 ms; mean max. gape 53?). SO, FO and FC, but not SC, stages are evident. Hyolingual movements are used for intraoral transport, but pharyngeal expansion (and presumably suction) accompanies deglutition. The tongue pad becomes dimpled during retraction; it is likely that lingual suction combined with interlocking, not sticky mucus, are responsible for prey adhesion. We infer that Leurognathus is secondarily aquatic and has retained the primitive (Plethodontid) feeding mechanism. 617 THE EVOLUTION OF MOTOR PATTERNS USED DURING PREY CAPTURE IN LOWER VERTEBRATES. P.C. Wainwright. C.P.J. Sanford. S.M. Rcillv and G.V. Lauder. Univ. of California, Irvine. Previous studies have shown that the pattern of muscle activity used by feeding fishes and salamanders tends to be strongly conserved among closely related species (congeneric or confamilial). We have tested this generality at a broader phylogenetic scale, quantitatively comparing the suction feeding motor pattern exhibited by the salamander Ambvstoma and four ray finned fishes: Amia. Notopterus. Micropterus and Lepomis. Using small fish as prey, data were collected from ten feedings from at least four individuals in each species. Motor patterns were quantified by measuring 11 variables from the electromyogram (EMG) of each feeding that summarized the intensity and relative timing of activity in four muscles. The data were analyzed with nested ANOVAs and an overall MANOVA. Most of the EMG variables characterizing the intensity of muscle contraction were different in at least one species. Two of the relative timing variables were conserved across all species while the third shows a change in the two derived teleosts, Micropterus and Lepomis. These results show that there has been considerable evolution of the suction feeding motor pattern, although several features seem to be broadly conserved among aquatic lower vertebrates.</page><page sequence="116">116A American Society of Zoologists 618 KINEMATICS OF FEEDING BEHAVIOR IN Ascaphus truei. K. Nishikawa and D. Cannatella. Univ. of KY, Lexington, and Louisiana State Univ., Baton Rouge. Ascaphus truei is the sister group of all other frogs. Like other "discoglossoid frogs", it possesses a plesiomorphic hyobranchial skeleton and tongue. The tongues of these primitive frog species are broadly attached to the floor of the mouth, and can be protruded only a short distance beyond the mandible. More advanced frogs, such as Bufo marinus, have anteriorly attached tongues that are rotated over the mandibular symphysis, and may project far beyond the mandible. Ascaphus differs from more advanced frogs in the reach and accuracy of the tongue, but not in the time required for tongue protraction and retraction. Unlike Bufo, Ascaphus lunges toward prey with its whole body and almost always overshoots the prey by half a head length. Ascaphus shares with advanced frogs a marked depression of the mandibular symphysis during feeding, which has not been observed in salamanders or caecilians. Symphysial depression appears to be a synapomorphy for all extant frogs, associated with the m. submentalis. 619 IHE HYQLINGuAL FEEDING MECHANISM CF SAIAMANDRINA TERDIGTTATA (URQCEIA: SALAMANDRIDAE). B.T. Miller and J.H. Larsen, Jr., Washington State Univ., Pullman. The feeding mechanism of terrestrial Salamandrina terdigitata was investigated using high speed cinematography (300 fps), scanning electron microscopy, and examination of cleared and double- stained specimens. Tongue projection consists of two stages: protrusion and flip. During the protrusion stage the hyolingual skeleton is moved anteriorly such that the basibranchial (BB) and surrounding tissue extend 1.5 - 2.0 mm beyond the mandibular symphysis. In addition, the tongue pad is subsequently lifted from the floor of the mouth as the radial cartilages (RCs) rotate approx. 60? around the anterior tip of the BB. Tongue flipping involves additional rapid rotation ? 3 ms) of the RCs from their 60? "cocked" position to full extension (approx. 180?). The greatly elongated RCs and free pad extend the tongue up to 20% of snout- vent length beyond the mandibular symphysis. The tongue remains near full extension for 20 - 35 ms prior to the start of retraction. During retraction, the RCs retrace the are of the projection pathway and the BB is withdrawn deep into the buccal cavity. Unlike most salamandrid species, jS. terdigitata lacks a kinetic-inertial component to its gape cycle. Also, the marginal teeth apparently have a limited role in prey capture; they are relatively small and located at the base, rather than at the sunmit, of the alveolar ridge. 620 qUAOTnATIVE HNEMATICS CF FEEDING IN BOLHXX3DSSA OCCHENrALIS: A SALAMANDER WITH A "BREE" PROJECTILE TCNGUE. J.T. Beneski, Jr., West Chester Univ., PA, J.H. Larsen, Jr., Washington State Uhiv., Pullman, and D.B. Wake, Univ. of Calif., Berkeley. Ihe feeding system of the plethodontid salamander Bolitoglossa occidentalis, which has a "free" projectile tongue, was investigated using high speed cinematography (500 fps). The kinematics of prey capture were quantified and compared to those of 6 other species of salamander that either had a "free" projectile tongue (JJ. mexicana), attached projectile tongue (Ensatina), or attached protrusible tongue (Desmognathus, Plethodon, and Hynobius). The prey capture cycle of all 7 species is characterized by a 4 phase gape cycle (initial gape, intermediate gape, final gape, and final mouth closure) upon which is superimposed a 2 phase tongue cycle (tongue protraction and tongue retraction). Although the tongue is always the structure to make initial contact with the prey, there are several consistent differences in the kinematics of tongue deployment: "free" tongued salamanders expend more time preparing the tongue for projection than either attached projectile or attached protrusible tongued salamanders, and both "free" projectile and attached projectile tongued salamanders expend less time actually projecting the tongue than attached protrusible tongued salamanders. Maximum tongue extension is approximately 30% SVL in "free" projectile tongued salamanders, but only 7% SVL in attached protrusible tongued salamanders. 621 FUNCTIONAL MORPHOLOGY AND NEUROMUSCULAR CONTROL OF FEEDING IN FROGS AND SALAMANDERS. D.Wake. K.Nishikawa. and G.Roth*. Univ. of CA, Berkeley, Univ. of KY, Lexington, and Univ. of Bremen, FRG. Frogs and salamanders rely on tongue protrusion to apprehend terrestrial prey. Hyoid elements of frogs fuse early in ontogeny to form an unarticulated plate that supports the tongue at rest, but plays only a minor role in feeding. Tongue protraction and retraction involve the m. submentalis (trigeminal nerve) and the mm. genioglossus and hyoglossus (hypoglossal). In most salamanders, the articulated hyobranchial skeleton leaves the mouth with the tongue during feeding. The main tongue protractor is the m. subarcualis rectus (glossopharyngeal and vagus), and the retractor is the m. rectus cervicis (hypoglossal). In salamanders, the onset of muscular activity is nearly simultaneous, whereas in frogs muscle activity is staggered and even the two intrinsic tongue muscles fire at different times. There is broad overlap of motor nuclei associated with feeding in salamanders, but these nuclei are discretly separated in frogs. Feeding systems in both frogs and salamanders have diversified within narrow limits.

Escalona de Motta* and J.E. Garcfa-Arrargfe. Univ. of Puerto Rico, Rfo Piedras. In our study of the nervous system of Sabellastarte magnif ica, a tube-dwelling polychaete, we have identified neuropeptide- and monoamine- containing cells and fibers within the double ventral nerve cord using the indirect iramunofluorescence technique. Cholecystokinin-containing cells and fibers are widely distributed in the cord and lateral nerves. FMRFamide-, neuropeptide Y- and serotonin^containing cells appear restricted to the ventro-lateral area of the cord, while those containing substance P are located laterally. This characteristic distribution of the various neuron subgroups and fiber pathways may represent functional circuits within the nervous system of this annelid. Neuropharraacological studies are in progress to study the possible physiological role of these substances.

Mukai, H.R. Khan,* and A.S.M. Saleuddin. York Univ., Toronto, Canada. The caudodorsal cells(CDC) and mediodorsal cells(MDC) are neuro? secretory cells located in the cerebral ganglia of the freshwater snail H. duryi and are known to regulate egg laying and growth respectively. Virgin and castrated snails lay markedly fewer eggs and display accelerated growth compared to mated snails. Extracellular re- cordings from the cerebral commi? ssure (CDC neurohaemal area) of vir? gins indicated that they were elec- trically silent whereas after a first mating there was a signifi? cant increase in eiectrical activi? ty. Recordings from the labial nerve(MDC neurohaemal area) of vir? gins and castrates showed more pro- nounced eiectrical activity compar? ed to mating animals. It appears mating stimulates the CDC while in non-egg laying snails the MDC show increased eiectrical activity. This study confirms that eiectrical act? ivity corresponds with the synthet? ic activity of neurosecretory cells. 624 ISOLATION OF A 6-PDH ANALOG FROM THE CRAYFISH, PROCAMBARUS CLARKII. M.L. McCallum*, K.R. Rao, J.P. RiehmrO. Mohrherr, and W.T. "Morgan*. Oniv. of West Florida, Pensacola; Louisana State Univ. Medical School, New Orleans. The major form of pigment-dispersing hormone (PDH) present in the eyestalks of Procambarus was purified by a series of steps including batch chromatography with Bio-Rex 70, liquid partition, gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, partition chromatography, and reversed- phase HPLC. Automated gas-phase sequencing revealed the primary structure of the purified peptide as: NSELINSILGLPKVMNEA. This sequence and the nature of the C-terminus (amidation) are being verified by chemical synthesis. Procambarus PDH differs from 3-PDH (isolated from Uca and Cancer) at only one position, Glu-17 in place of Asp-17. This finding and the nature of PDHs identified from other crustaceans and insects suggest that 3-PDH (or a closely related form) is more widely distributed thana-PDH, which has so far been found in Pandalus.

We have developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) using an antiserum raised against synthetic B-PDH (Uca/Cancer pigment-dispersing hormone). This assay involves colorimetric identification of 3-PDH antibodies after combination with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and reaction with p-nitrophenyl phosphate. In competitive tests the antiserum recognized 3-PDH with an IC-50 of 160 fmol/well, but showed little affinity fora-PDH (Pandalus DRPH, which differs from3-PDH at positions 3, 4, 11, 13, 16, 17). Whena-PDH analogs containing 8-PDH-related substitutions were tested, the analogs with Asn-16 and Asp-17 reacted better than the others. PDH family members that are closely related to 6-PDH (e.g., insect PDFs and Penaeus PDH) reacted with affinities ranging from 13 to 75%. The antiserum failed to recognize a C-terminally truncated analog of 3-PDH (1-13-amide). These results indicate that the antiserum needs several of the residues closer to the C-terminus in 3-PDH for antigen recognition.

Univ. of Georgia, Athens. Chemical mediation of insect digestion is largely unexplored. Anti-FMRF-amide (molluscan neuropeptide) sera were used in immunocytochemistry and radioimmuno- assay (RIA) to examine midgut and cere? bral nervous tissues of 5th instar corn earworm (Eeliothis zed) larvae to assess alterations accompanying short term changes in feeding. Immunostaining occurred (a) in numerous midgut endo? crine cells, and (b) in neurons/axons of brain, subesophageal ganglion, stomato- gastric system and neuroendocrine cor- pora cardiaca-corpora allata complex. Midgut immunoreactivity was ^ doubled for fed {ad Hb.) vs. starved (-diet/2 d) larvae, but brain tissues were not different. RIA of hemolymph showed coin- cident changes: ^60 vs. 250 fm ir-FMRF- amide/ul, fed vs. starved larvae. Thus, midgut is a likely source of hemolymph immunoreactivity, which may be released with altered feeding state. (Dedicated affectionately to H.A.

Hemolymph samples collected from female blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) and penaeid shrimp were extracted with ethyl acetate:hexane and the sterOid-containing fraction chromatographed on Sephadex-LH 20 columns precalibrated with 3H-estradiol. Eluded fractions were subjected to stand? ard radioimmunoassay methodology using rabbit anti-estradiol. Samples of hemo- lymp from both species were also charac? terized by high performance liquid chrom? atography utilizing a C-18 column with acetonitrile as the non-polar stationary phase and water as the polar mobile phase. Results indicate significant levels of an estrogen-like compound are present in hemolymph of both species. Further characterization of this compound will contribute a more complete understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the control of reproductive cycles in these invertebrates. 628 DISTRIBUTION OF GABAA RECEPTORS IN AN AMPHIBIAN BRAIN. Miles Orchinik and Frank L. Moore. Oregon State Univ. Corvallis. Previous behavior studies of male newts (Taricha granulosa) indicated that corticosterone (CS) and GABA both may act to suppress sexual behaviors. To identify possible target sites for GABA and CS, receptor assays using binding of [35S]-TBPS (specific radioligand for GABA^ receptors) to newt brain synaptic membranes found that TBPS-binding affinity was similar to that in mammals. However, TBPS-bind? ing concentrations were lower in brain tissues from newts than mammals, pri? marily due to low binding in newt telencephalon. Quantitative auto- radiography found that TBPS-binding in newt brains was highest in ventral thalamus, dorsal thalamus, optic tectum, tegmentum, and medulla. Moderate to low TBPS-binding was found in the lateral amygdala, striatum, medial pallium, and olfactory bulb. We also found that TBPS-binding was inhibited by CS, suggesting that CS could be acting directly on the GABA receptor macromolecular complex to inhibit amphibian sex behaviors. 629 ALTERATIONS IN CYCLIC AMP- DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE INTHE PROTHORACIC GLANDS OF DIAPAUSING MANDUCA SEXTA. I. Rieger and W.A. Smith. Northeastern Univ., Boston, MA. Diapause is a state of developmental arrest which allows an organism to bypass adverse environmental conditions. In Manduca sexta diapause is characterized by decreased titers of ecdysteroids in the hemolymph resulting from inhibition of prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) release arid altered prothoracic gland activity. Results of previous studies suggest that glandular refractoriness to PTTH occurs at a point in the steroidogenesis pathway beyond the synthesis of cAMP, e.g., at the level of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. This possibility was further investigated using 8-azido-(32P)cAMP photoaffinity labelling and (3H)cAMP binding experiments. The results suggest a decrease in specific regulatory subunits of c AMP-dependent protein kinase during diapause. Substrate availability does not appear to be reduced in glands from diapausing animals, as measured by cAMP-dependent incorporation of (32P) into cellular proteins. Evidence to date points to a lesion in the cAMP-dependent protein kinase as a factor in PTTH refractoriness during diapause in Manduca sexta.

T. Kaneko*, R^_ Ohtani*, T. Labedz*, Y. Tang* and P.K.T. Pang. Univ. of Alberta, Edmonton. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has been extensively studies in various mammalian species, and found in both cen? tral and peripheral nervous systems. CGRP has been suggested to act as a neurotrans- mitter to control vascular and GI smooth muscles. There are, however, few studies on this peptide in non-mammalian species. In the present study, we attempted to localize CGRP immunocytochemically in whole amounts, as well as frozen and paraffin sections, of mouse, rat, guinea pig, chick? en, iguana, bullfrog, goldfish and rain? bow trout small intestines. Immunoreactive (ir-) cell bodies were found in the plexus of the mammals, in which dense networks of CGRP neurons were observed. In non- mammalian species, however, ir-cell bodies could not be detected, although ir- fibers were present in the plexus. Our results indicate that CGRP is extensively present in the plexus of intestines from fish to mammals, suggesting that CGRP is involved inGI smooth muscle activity through verte? brates.

Univ. of Denver, Denver, CO. and Macquarie Univ., Syndey, Australia. Acid extracts of the pituitary of the Australian lungfish, Neoceratodus forsteri were fractionated on a Sephadex G-75 column and screened with a middle region specific ACTH(l-39) RIA. This antibody has full molar crossreactivity with synthetic human ACTH(l-24) and 10% crossreactivity with synthetic human ACTH( 18-39)/ but less than 0.1% molar crossreactivity with alpha-MSH. Four peaks of immunoreactivity were detected with this RIA. Two minor peaks eluted with apparent molecular weights of 30K and 10K, respectively. Major peaks of ACTH(1-39)-sized material and CLIP-sized material were detected. The two major peaks were further analyzed by reverse phase HPLC, however neither lungfish peptide co-eluted with either synthetic ACTH(l-39) or ACTH(18-39). These results suggests sequence differences between lungfish ACTH and CLIP and the mammalian peptides. Isoelectric focusing analysis of the lungfish ACTH and CLIP are in progress.

Steady state analyses of the pars distalis of larval Ambystoma indicate that both ACTH (1-39) and an alpha-MSH-related peptide are major end products in this tissue. Following metamorphorsis there is a decline in the steady state levels of the alpha-MSH-related peptide. These results would suggest that the processing of ACTH is developmentally regulated in this amphibian. In order to demonstrate that ACTH(1-39) is converted to alpha-MSH/ it will be necessary to analyze ACTH processing in vitro. Oontrol experiments were set up to determine the viability of pars distalis explants in L-15 medium. These tests indicated that pars distalis explants were viabile for at least 48hr in this medium. Steady labeling and pulse/chase labeling paradigms are planned in a effort to demonstrate a biosynthetic connection between ACTH(1-39) and the alpha-MSH-related material present in the larval pars distalis.

Univ. of Denver, Denver, 00. and Univ. of Georgia, Athens, GA. Studies on the holostean fish, Amia calva, revealed the presence of multiple forms of N-acetylated beta-endorphin and alpha-MSH in the pars intermedia of this species. In order to determine whether N-acetylation is a common post-translational processing mechanism in holostean fish, studies were done on a representative from the genus, Lepisosteus. Amia and Lepisosteus represent the only two surviving genera in the order Holostei. Acid extracts of the pars intermedia of JL. platyrhinchus were fractionated on a Sephadex G-75 column and column fractions were separately screened with a N-terminal specific beta-endorphin RIA, a middle region specific ACTH(l-39) RIA and a C-terminal specific alpha-MSH RIA. Beta-endorphin-sized immunoreactive forms and alpha-MSH-sized forms represented the major pro-opiomelanocortin end products detected in this tissue. Trace amounts of ACTH(l-39)-sized material were also detected.

L.K. McDonald, J.W. Crim and R.M. Pores. Univ. of Denver, Denver, 00., and Univ. of Georgia, Athens, G.A. Immunohistochemical studies indicated that enkephalin-related immunoreactivity is present in the neural lobe of the pituitary of the holostean fish, Amia calva. Acid extracts of the neurointermediate lobe were fractionated by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 column. Ehkephalin-sized material was detected with a Met-enkephalin RIA. This material was further fractionated by reverse phase HPLC and fractions were separately screened with a Met-enkephalin RIA and a Leu-enkephalin RIA. Two peaks of immunoreactivity were detected which co-eluted with synthetic Met-enkephalin and Leu-enkephalin, respectively. The molar ratio of Met- to Leu-enkephalin was 4:1. Based on these results it would appear that pro-enkephalin in this species of holostean fish contains fours copies of the Met-enkephalin sequence and one copy of the Leu-enkephalin sequence.

University of Colorado, Boulder, Co. We tested the hypothesis that activation of interrenal secretory activity during metamor? phosis of the bullfrog was accompanied by differentiation of immunoreactive (ir) corticotropin-releasing factor-like (CRF) and arginine vasotocin-like (AVT) fiber systems in the hypothalamus. CRF-like immunostaining in the median eminence (ME) was sparce or absent from premetamorphic tadpoles, but increased dramatically by late prometamorphosis. CRF- like-ir in the ME was most dense in climax tadpoles. AVT-like-ir perikarya were visualized in the magnocellular (Mg) nucleus, with extensive immunostaining of fibers in the medial basal and infundibular hypothalamus as well as in the ME and pars nervosa (PN) of the pituitary. AVT-like perikarya were virtually absent in premetamorphic tadpoles, but their number increased dramatically by Taylor-Kollros Stage XII and continued to increase thereafter. AVT- like-ir fibers in the ME, hypothalamus and PN showed a similar pattern. These results suggest a role for both CRF and AVT in mediating the activation of interrenal secretory activity seen during metamorphosis.

Systemic injections of 5-hydroxytryp- tophan (5-HTP), the precursor to seroto? nin, stimulates melanin dispersion within dermal melanophores of red-spotted newts (Notophthalmus viridescens). Injections of para-Chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis, inhib? ited melanin dispersion, and hence darkening of the skin, when newts were transferred to a dark background. The results indicate a role for serotonin- ergic activity in the background adapta? tion response in this amphibian.

Department of Biology, Siena College, Loudonville, NY and Department of Biolog? ical Sciences, S.U.N.Y., Albany, NY, USA Body weight of terrestrial-phase efts of Notophthalmus viridescens treated with 0.01-10 ug/g of the ?-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, increased in a dose-depen- dent manner. An increase in water uptake across the skin accounts for this increase in body weight. Urine output does not de? crease. Both propranolol (0-blocker) and phentolamine (of-blocker) at 10 ug/g failed to block the increased water uptake caused by either 10 ug/g isoproterenol, a salt- load/ or dehydration. However, propranolol but not phentolamine did block the respon- ce to a lower dose of isoproterenol (0.1 ug/g). These data suggest that catechol- amines, acting through 0-receptors, can mimic the effect of AVT on integumental water permeability, but not the effect of AVT on urine production. In contrast to anurans, the newt water-balance response to dehydration or salt-loading does not appear to be mediated primarily through ^-adrenergic agents.

R.J. Borski. L.M.H. Helms. and E.G. Grau. University of Hawaii, Honolulu. Prolactin (PRL) plays a central role in the freshwater osmoregulation of many euryhaline fishes. The PRL cells of the tilapia rostral pars distalis (RPD) respond apjpropriately to changes in osmotic pressure (OP), releasing increasing quantities of hormone as OP is reduced. On the other hand, cortisol (F) plays an important role in the seawater adapt? ation of euryhaline teleost fishes. Findings from previous in vitro studies suggest that the actions of F in the tilapia may oe medi? ated in part through its ability to inhibit the secretion of PRL. Recently, we have shown that the inhibition of PRL release by F is related to dose when RPD are incubated for 20 hrs in hyposmotic medium (HO; 300 mOsmolal). We also examined the possible roles of the cAMP and Ca++ messenger systems in mediating the response of the tilapia PRL cell to F. Our previous studies have shown that exposure to HO medium for 1 hour in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, IBMX, signifi? cantly elevates cAMP accumulation in the til? apia RPD above that observed in tissues incu? bated in hyperosmotic medium (355 mOsmolal). In the present studies, we found F blocks this increase in cAMP accumulation. This sug? gests that an action on the cAMP-messenger system by F may play some role in mediating its inhibitory action on PRL release. Recent? ly, we have shown that reduced OP increases the accumulation of 45Ca++ into the tilapia RPD. Our studies to date, however, have failed to show an inhibitory effect of F on this 45Ca++ accumulation. This suggests that F may not act on Ca++ channels that appear to be activated by reduced medium OP.

Univ. of California, Berkeley. Ihe rostral pars distalis (RPD) from iinmature and mature tilapia was incubated for 16 hr at 27* C in hypotonic medium in the presence (10~?M and 10"l:1M) or absence of GAP, a potent FKD-inhibiting factor in mammals, and different putative cleavage products. The release of the two forms of HRL in tilapia into the medium was measured by SDS-PAGE followed by densitometry. GAP inhibited release of total FRL while stimulating release of newly-synthesized large ERL only from immature RPDs. Fragment 28-36 stimulated, at 10""%, release of newly-synthesized FRL from immature RPDs. This stimulation appears to be dependent on the osmotic pressure of the medium, since this fragment did not affect ERL release in hypertonic medium. Fragment 38-49 inhibited release of total FRL from immature RPDs and release of newly- synthesized FRL from mature RPDs. Fragment 51-66 stimulated total FRL release from mature RPDs. These results suggest that GAP, as well as some of its fragments, may have direct effects on the FRL cells in the tilapia pituitary (Aided by a Fulbright-HIa Caixa" Fellowship to J.P. and NSF grant DCB 84-05249). 640 PURIFICATION OF PROLACTIN FROM THE ATLANTIC CROAKER (MICROPOGONIAS UNDULATUS). S.E. Safford and P. Thomas. The University of Texas Marine Science Institute, Port Aransas. A protein which is immunoreactive to prolactin antisera has been isolated from pituitaries of male and female Atlantic croaker, (Micropogonias undulatusV Pituitaries (4700) were homogenized in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.4, to remove the glycoproteins, then extracted with acid- acetone. A sample of the acid - acetone extract run on SDS/PAGE resolved several bands. One band with an approximate molecular weight of 20,000 daltons stained consistently with both coho and chinook prolactin antiserum (gifts from P.Swanson and P.Prunet) in immunoblot analysis. The acid- acetone extract applied to a gel filtration analytical HPLC column eluted as two peaks. Immunoblot analysis of the second HPLC peak with coho prolactin antiserum revealed a single band of approximately 19,000 daltons. No immunoreactivity was found in the first HPLC peak. After complete characterization of the HPLC fractions by SDS/PAGE and immunoblotting, the prolactin protein will be further purified and its biological actions examined in a prolactin bioassay. 641 CHROMATOGRAPHIC ISOLATION OF FUNDULUS HETEROCLITUS GONADOTROPIN(S).

Size exclusion (Superose 6+12) chromatography eluted the GTH activities in one major protein peak (M.W. 30-60 kDa). Anion-exchange (Mono-Q) chromatography provided several active fractions well separated from most of the pituitary protein. Chromatofocusing (Mono-P) resolved FPE into 3 active fractions. Further purification by hydrophobic-interaction (TSK-phenyl-5- PW) chromatography indicated 2 peaks of estrogen steroidogenic activities and one of which is relatively poor in inducing 17&lt;*-0H, 20/J-dihydroprogesterone and testosterone production.

This glycoprotein-enriched extract was fractionated by stepwise elution from a DE 52 ion exchange gel. Immunoreactivity in a RIA for Atlantic croaker maturational GTH was found in three fractions eluting from DE 52 in 0.2 M NH4HCO3 (fractions 4 and 5) and 0.5 M NH4HCO3 (fraction 6). Immunoblot analyses of SDS PAGE gels with GTH antiserum revealed a single band in fraction 4 and double bands in fractions 5 and 6, all with molecular weights of approximately 28,000. Further purification of the DE 52 GTH fractions by gel-permeation HPLC revealed GTH immunoreactivity in a peak with a molecular weight of approximately 46,000. Biological activity in a homologous final oocyte maturation assay was found primarily in fractions 5 and 6. We conclude that the gonadotropin(s) detected in seatrout pituitaries represent forms of GTH having differing charge characteristics but almost identical molecular weights. 643 THE EFFECT OF ORGANIC EXTRACTS FROM THE MARINE SPONGE, CALLYSPOKGIA DIFFUSA, OK ARTSMIA AND TWO MARINE HK55XEGAE.

W.K. Fitt, Univ? ersity of Georgia, Athens. Planulae larvae and asexually-produced buds from Cassiopea sp. are induced to settle and metamorphose by a variety of small peptides. Inducers are also pro? duced by bacteria in the presence of appropriate substrates, suggesting that in nature specificity for recruitment into specific habitats may be as much a function of substrate availability as presence of specific species of bacteria. The involvement of inducer-receptor int? eraction in "triggering" metamorphosis is suggested by radioactive labelling experiments, displacement of inducers and delay of metamorphosis with specific inhibitors, and observations of competency of buds during their development. 645 PRODUCTION OF AMMONIA BY FED AND STARVED OYSTERS, CRASSOSTREA GIGAS, IN RELATION TO METABOLISM AND METAMORPHOSIS.

Rumrill. Smithsonian Marine Station, Fort Pierce, FL 34946. Although the sea star Pisaster ochraceus is an inportant member of marine invertebrate caramunities in the Pacific Northwest, the larval settlement preferences and population dynamics are poorly understood. Embryos of P. ochraceus develop from small ova and reach a metamorphically competent brachiolaria stage after 53 to 69 days in the laboratory. Larvae settled preferentially upon substrata collected from the lower (Laminaria) intertidal zone. The size-structure of P? ochraceus populations differed markedly between 20 study sites over the period 1984 - 1987. Recruitment events were predictable and intense at sites protected from direct surf. Densities of new recruits declined rapidly over the summer and most remaining juveniles were restricted to crevices in the low intertidal by August. Concurrent long-term (&gt;10 yr) data on density, size-structure, and larval abundance and distribution are necessary to fully evaluate the importance of periodic recruitment events to populations of p. ochraceus. 648 MATE SELECTION IN THE PROTANDRIC LIMPET CREPIDULA CONVEXA - CHOICE OR CHANCE. JP. Aitken-Ander &amp; D.R. Franz*. Biol. Dept., Brooklyn College, Brooklyn NY 11210 Sizes of mated Crepidula convexa were positively correlated in field and laboratory pairings. Males seem to ex- ert the primary role in mate selection and have several mates before changing sex. Males mount a female1s shell from the rear and use their tentacles to ex? plore its surface - possibly a means of assessing female size. In the labora? tory, larger males can displace, and successfully resist displacement by, smaller males. Large females do not participate in significantly more pair? ings than smaller females. Males select females appropriate for their body size or larger. Thus, males maximize their fertility by mating with several females and choosing increasingly larger (more fecund) females as they grow. Reproduc? tive success depends on the male's abil? ity to resist displacement. These be? haviors (select larger females; resist displacement) produce the observed size- assortive mating pattern. As males grow, fertility is limited by the scarcity of large females. Sex change occurs at a male size where fertility drops below the rising curve of female fecundity (as predicted by the size-advantage model). 649 VOLATILE COMPOUNDS OF THE COELOMIC FLUID OF NEREIDS: BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY AS SEX PHEROMONES - H0M0L0GUES OF INSECT PHE- R0M0NES. J. D. Hardege, H. Bartels-Hardege and G. Wesselmann. Univ. of Oldenburg. Volatile compounds of the coelomic fluid of nereid species were concentrated by using a closed-loop-stripping method and identified by GC-MS. The main compounds were hydrocarbons, aldehydes and ketones. Heterospecific biological activity of these substances and of the sex pheromones of Platynereis dumerilii were electrophy- siologically and in behavioural assays tested on Nereis succinea and Nereis diversicolor. Based on these results the concept of using pheromone bouquets in species-recognition during reproduction of species living in the same area was discussed for Platynereis dumerilii and Nereis succinea. Most of the identified substances show activity as pheromones in insects, especially as alarm substances such as the sex pheromone of P. dumerilii 5-methyl-3-heptanone. These substances may demonstrate the conformity of the chemical nature of pheromones in water and air, respectively of annelids and insects. Thus an evolutionary aspect is given to this work.</page><page sequence="124">124A American Society of Zoologists 650 THE INFLUENCE OF VISUAL ORIENTATIONAL CUES ON THE TRAIL- FOLLOWING BEHAVIOR OF THE MARSH PERIWINKLE LITTORINA IRRORATA. Richard A. Tankerslev. Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC. The marsh periwinkle Littorina irrorata, like many gastropods, can detect conspecific mucous trails and often follows them with polarity. Although trail-following is a common component of L. irrorata's behavioral repertoire, the adaptive significance of this behavior is not evident. In this study, I examined the conditions under which L. irrorata follows trails and the possible role of trail -following in orientation. In field arenas, the frequency and degree of trail-following by periwinkles were significantly higher under conditions in which the marker's trail was deposited in response to a visual directional stimulus. No significant differences were found between controls and treatments in which an orientational cue was absent for marker snails. These data suggest that trails deposited by visually oriented marker snails might possess a different informational content than trails deposited by unoriented snails. Microscopic and elemental analysis of trails deposited by the same snail while crawling in the absence or presence of directional stimuli revealed no noticeable differences in the overall physical or chemical structure of the trails. 651 A MOLLUSCAN FACTOR AFFECTING PHOTOTAXIS IN THE SYMBIOTIC WATER MITE, UNIONICOLA FORMOSA. J.D. Jack and R.V. Dimock, Jr. Wake Forest Univ., Winston-Salem, NC 27109. The water mite Unionicola formosa is an obligate symbiont in the mantle cavity of the freshwater bivalve Anodonta imbecilis. Adults are positively phototactic in clean water, but negatively phototactic in water conditioned by their molluscan host. The factor mediating this phototactic reversal has two active components with molecular weights of 60,000 and 28,000 daltons. Both components contain amino groups and are sensitive to trypsinization. The reversal of phototaxis was host-specific; attempts to condition the mites to respond to a non-host mussel were unsuccessful. The receptors for this cue are located on the front legs of the mite. 652 NEURONAL PATHWAYS IN THE BRAIN OF TRITONIA DIOMEDIA, THAT MEDIATE ORIENTATION BEHAVIOR TO THE EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD. Randall S. Hewea* and A.Q.Dennis WillQws. university of Washington, Seattle. Prior experiments have shown that the marine nudibranch mollusc Tzitonia diomedia orients to the earth's magnetic field and that a pair of re-identifiable neurons in the pedal ganglia (R and LPe5) respond by firing electrical impulses when the ambient field direction is changed. We report here interactions between several other identifiable neurons in the ipsilateral pedal ganglia and Pe5. Stimulation of any one of at least 3 small and medium sized neurons located nearby on the dorsal surfaces of the ganglion elicit a prominent polyphasic synaptic volley in Pe5. These inputs are polysynaptic judging by the prolonged delay from pre-synaptic stimulus to Pe5 response. These pre-synaptic neurons also elicit prominent motor responses when stimulated in a semi-intact animal preparation. We conclude that the action of Pe5 in magnetosensory orientation behaviors is modulated by parallel inputs from other motor or pre-motor neurons. 653 DIFFERENTIAL RESPONSES BY DEVELOPING HYMENOLEPIS DIMINUTA AND HOST RATS TO PROTEIN FREE DIETS. M.S.Melnychuk and M.S.Williams.* Bloomsburg Univeristy of PA. Limited information exists that des? cribes the effects of ingesting protein free diets on the condition of Hymeno? lepis diminuta and host rats. Weight paired, female rats were fed one of three diets for 5 days pre- and 22 days post- infection with 12 cysticercoids of Hymenolepis diminuta: a protein free, fed ad libitum; a 20% casein offered accord? ing to intake by rats ingesting the pro? tein free diet, pair-fed and a 20% casein fed ?d libitum. Upon sacrifice of hosts, parasites were excised and examined. Mean daily caloric intake was greatest in rats fed casein ad libitum and least in pair- fed. All groups had the same mean initial body weight, but rats ingesting protein gained weight, and rats fed no protein lost weight. No significant difference in the mean number of worms per host or intestinal scolex location existed between any group. Worms from hosts fed no pro? tein were longest and heaviest while worms from pair-fed hosts were the smallest. Hosts ingesting the protein free diet consumed the most carbohydrate while those pair-fed consumed the least. The data suggest that with a short term, small size infection, ingested protein improves host condition while ingested carbohydrate improves parasite condition.</page><page sequence="125">Abstracts 125A 654 TRYPANOSOMA MUSCULI: EFFECT OF ZINC DEFICIENCY ON INFECTION. P. Humphrey and CM. Lee. Howard University, Washington, D.C. A metabolic imbalance technique was employed to study zinc defi? ciency in mice infected with Trypanosoma musculi. Throughout the study, animals on the defi? cient diet had lowered zinc levels compared to complete and pair-fed animals. The indices of lowered resistance to infection in the zinc deficient mice were manifold. Deficient mice suffered earlier and had higher parasitemia followed by persistent infection. Severe depression in the primary and secondary antibody responses (IgM and IgG) to in vivo immuniza- tion with sheep erythrocytes was also observed in the deficient animals. Hematological responses remained unaltered. The infec? tion elicited increased acid phosphatase activity, macrophage phagocytosis, and macrophage spreading. 655 GENETIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THREE SPECIES OF THALASSINID SHRIMP FROM LOUISIANA. * J.L. Staton, P.L. Felder, and D.W. Foltz , Univ. Southwestern Louisiana, Lafayette, and Louisiana State Univ., Baton Rouge. A previous study separated coastal Gulf of Mexico Callianassidae into two genera based on morphologie differences. The genus Callichirus was found to be separate from the genus Callianassa on the basis of cheliped, uropod, telson, and abdominal somite morphology. Recently, we investigated the relative mobilities of allozymes in Callichirus major, C. islagrande, and Callianassa louisianensis using starch gel electrophoresis with reference to divergence between these genera. Preliminary results indicate different levels of polymorphlsm between the species studied. Prospective alleles examined from the two genera demonstrate fixed allelic differences between the genera Callichirus and Callianassa. We propose that levels of polymorphlsm are consistent with life history patterns and dispersal mechanisms for the species, and fixed alleles exist which biochemically typify the two genera.

Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, Canada. The identification of an unambiguous synapomorphy and recognition of all taxa of Guaranidrilus, a primarily South American taxon, has been obscured by character losses within the lineage. Previous phylogenetic studies of this group resulted in hypotheses poorly supported by morphological character data and not supporting a single lineage. Recurring polyploidism in Enchytraeidae, relatively high intrataxic variability in some species of Guaranidrilus, morphogenic irregularities and absence of some reproductive structures suggested reproductive and speciation anomalies. Recent cladistic analyses indicate taxa with predictably mobile relationships, and with homoplasy in otherwise conservative characters. A monophyly is supported for G uaran i d r i1 u s . Hybridization between taxa with both close and distant relationships is hypothesized for one derived sublineage of the genus. Apparent homoplastic origins of other characters has similarly obscured the limits of Hemienchytraeus and may also be th e result 57 hybridization. 688 DOES raFKOSF CHAN3E LOTD AND SCGAR LEVELS IN OUB BLOCH)? R.B. Weinstein, T.M. Hennessev, J.P. Mosovich* and CF. Herreid, IL SONJf at Buffalo. The exact nature of the metabolic pathways used to produce cellular energy for exercising muscle tissue in the fiddler crab, Uca pugilator, is largely unknown. Fiddler crabs were exercised by running on a miniature treadmill for 30 min after which their blood was withdrawn and assayed. Gas chromatographic analysis shows that total acyl-linked fatty acids in the hemolymph do not change as a result of exercise. Ihe major fatty acids identified and quantified are palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, and arachidonic acid. The data show that the relative percentage of unsaturated acyl-linked fatty acids is elevated in the blood of exercising crabs. Gas chromatographic analysis of aldohexoses and inositol suggests that a and 0 glucose increase in the blood of exercising animals. A glucose oxidase assay also indicates that blood glucose increases as a result of exercise. However, an increase in exercise intensity does not augment the blood glucose response. In addition, the assay shows that handling of the crabs by the experimenter causes an increase in blood glucose and the elevated blood glucose levels persist for at least 90 min after handling. Increased levels of unsaturated fatty acids and glucose in the hemolymph could directly supply the exercising muscle tissue with the needed carbon sources for cellular respiration.

These drag- onflies double their body mass during adult maturation. This is due primarily to growth of flight muscle in males, and growth of ovaries in females. Males attain one of the highest FMR's of any animal; up to 60% of their mass is flight muscle. During observations of relative mating success among groups of 2-5 marked males, there was a significant decline in mat? ing success with decreasing FMR rank. This result suggests that a high FMR enhances ability to compete in aerial contests, which enables greater short-term mating success. Mature males with the highest FMR's had the least gut contents and fat reserves; thus there is a tradeoff between flight ability and nutritional state that may affect long-term mating success. 690 SEXUAL DIMORPHISM AND FATIGUE RESISTANCE OF COCKROACH FLIGHT MUSCLE. D.R. Stokes and J.G. Malamud. Eaory Univ., Atlanta, Ga., and Univ. Calif., Irvine. Tethered 20 day adult male P. americana fly about 15 min; females, 12 secs. Dimor? phism in flight capability extends to muscle 177c, a wing depressor, which is 1.5x more massive in males and contains 2x as many fibers as the female homologue. Fiber diameters are not significantly dif? ferent; however, male fibers appear ultra- structurally and biochemically to be more oxidative. Volume densities for mitochon? dria and glycogen profiles are 3 and 4x greater, respectively, and the specific activity for citrate synthase, an oxida? tive indicator is 3-4x greater in male fibers. Stimulation of the single moto? neuron to 177c at flight frequency (30 Hz) produces twitches which initially are of comparable magnitude for both male and female muscles. The magnitude of the twitches of male muscle exceeds 50% of the initial twitch amplitude for 9 min; fema? les, 3.5 secs. This enhanced fatigue re? sistance in male muscles is dependent on 0? flow through the tracheal system. 177c or terminal nymphs is similar in both sexes, suggesting that the males undergo a transformation to an oxidative, fatigue resistant profile, a feat which correlates with enhanced flight capability as adults. 691 SEASONAL VARIATION IN CALLING BEHAVIOR AND MUSCIE BIOCHEMISTRY IN SPRING PEEPERS (HYLA CRUCIFER). D.M. McKav* and T.L. Taigen. University of Conne- cticut, Storrs. Ihe breeding season of spring peepers begins early in the spring when tempera? tures are often near or below 0 C. At these cold temperatures, only a small fraction of the male population begins calling, despite the ready availability of females. As the season progresses and temperatures increase, additional males join the chorus and competition for females is intense. A biochemical analysis of the trunk muscles involved in sound production indicates that males collected early in the season have higher aerobic capacity, as indicated by citrate synthase (CS) activity [166 vs 94 umoles/(min*g) at 25 C], in com? parison with males collected later in the breeding season. Seasonal changes in vocal behavior of males in the chorus are tightly coupled to variation in muscle biochemistry. Both calling rate and sound pressure levels decline as the breeding season progresses apparently due to a reduced physiological capacity for muscle activity. 692 ADAPTATIONS OF AVIAN SKELETAL MUSCLE FOR AQUATIC LOCOMOTION: EVIDENCE FROM BIOPSIES AND 31P- NMR SPECTROSCOPY. T.M. Williams and J. Martin*. Sea World Research Institute and Univ. of California, San Diego. Penguins have developed a specialized morphology to meet the hydrodynamic and metabolic demands of swimming and diving. To determine how aquatic and aerial locomotion affects skeletal muscle characteristics, we examined the pectoralis of penguins and gulls. Fiber type composition and myoglobin concentration were determined from muscle samples. We used 31P-NMR spectroscopy to assess ADP, ATP, and phosphocreatine (PCr) stores. The pectoralis of penguins contained "faster" fibers and higher myoglobin concentrations than the muscles of gulls. PCr levels were greater for aquatic birds (PCr/B-ATP = 4.47 for penguins, 2.29 for gulls). Thus, several levels of organization ensure the availability of energy for muscular contraction during diving.

University of Wyoming, Laramie, Wy. 82071 Power input during hovering flight of unrestrained Broad-tailed hummingbirds (Selasphorus platycercus) is determined by measurement of O2 consumption and CO2 production using an open flow mask system attached to a feeder (A typical V02 - 670 ml'kg^-min"1, RQ - 1.03, power input is 233 W'kg"1). The full response time of the system is 2-3 seconds. Simultaneously wing beat frequency and amplitude are recorded. This information together with post- mortem measurement of various wing parameters allows calculation of power output using vortex theory aerodynamics. With this system it is possible to alter wing beat frequency and/or amplitude by adding weights to the bird or changing the shape of the feeder mask (range 34- 43 Hz, 110-148 degrees). Preliminary data indicate changes in flight efficiency as a result of such manipulations, suggesting elastic storage of inertial energy.

To test the hypothesis that heat produced as a by-product of activity substitutes for thermoregulatory requirements in free-ranging small birds, we used the doubly labeled water method to measure active phase field metabolic rates (FMR) of Verdins (Aurioarus flaviceps) wintering in the Colorado Desert of southern California. We recorded weather conditions to evaluate the influence of microclimate on Verdin energy requirements and to estimate thermostatic costs. Daytime FMR correlated negatively with operative environmental temperature (Te) but varied by + 30% among individuals under similar conditions. Regression analysis revealed that active phase FMR and laboratory- determined daytime resting metabolic rate (RMR) had similar temperature dependence. Thermoregulatory requirements were 25-50% of daytime energy expenditure in free- living Verdins. We conclude that, for Verdins, activity-generated metabolic heat does not substitute for thermostatic costs.

Rufous hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus^ appear to minimize the amount of time spent in nightly torpor during molt. If a given level of energy reserves serves as a threshold for initiation of torpor, then a "sliding threshold," which decreases with time of night, would reflect the diminishing amount of energy required before dawn feeding. Compared with an energy reserve threshold that remains constant with time, a sliding threshold could provide a mechanism for reducing the amount of time spent in torpor. The food supply of captive molting rufous hummingbirds was manipulated on successive days to achieve a wide range of body masses at dusk, with the result that the birds entered torpor at different times of night on different nights. Body mass at the time of entry into torpor was higher when birds entered torpor earlier in the night than when birds entered torpor later in the night. Body masses thus declined to a narrow range of body masses by morning. These results indicate that the decision to enter torpor is based on at least two pieces of information: energy reserves and time of night Supported by NSF grant DCB-8701687 to GJ.

Changes in the activity of metabolic enzymes (citrate synthase and lactate dehydrongenase) and the concentration of nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) of the white swimming musculature of fish correlate with whole fish metabolic and growth rates, respectively. Work with adult northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) and larval and juvenile California halibut (Paralicthys californicus) were used to calibrate these indices. 15 species of marine fish have been used to develop scaling relationships for these indices. Metabolic scope for locomotion grows with increasing body weight during the larval phase in all fish investigated, continues to increase for pelagic species during juvenile and adult life, decreases after metamorphosis and then increases in the early juvenile stages of the flatfish investigated. Scope for growth follows metabolic scope throughout development. We propose that this approach has great potential for use in analysis field energetics.</page><page sequence="128">128A American Society of Zoologists 697 ENERGY STORAGE AND REFRDDUCTTVE OUTHJT OF FEMALE DESERT TORTOISES (GOPHERUS AGASSIZI). B.T. Henen. Univ. of California, Los Angeles. I used non-destructive techniques to measure energy budgets of female desert tortoises and to evaluate the importance of lipid energy reserves to their reproductive effort. Lipid reserves were measured using the cyclopropane technique, egg production was measured with x-ray photography, and field metabolic rates were measured using the doubly labeled water technique. By eating dry grass during the summer, female tortoises entered positive energy balance and stored their surplus energy as lipid. From August to December 1987, female tortoises increased their lipid content form 2.1 to 7.9%. At the end of winter they were 3.8% lipid, a net increase from August 1987. This net increase of lipid equalled the amount of lipid used for their 1988 egg production. The lipid energy reserves acquired during the summer of 1987 were very important for the production of eggs in 1988 and for the costs of brumation.

FIC LDH FROM CICHLID FISH STUDIED BY BLUE DEXTRAN-SEPHAROSE AFFINITY CHROMATOGRAPHY. K.Peairs* &amp; W.S. Leibel, Lafayette College Easton, PA 18042 The homology of the coexpressed eye- &amp; liver-specific LDH isozymes from the Bas- ketmouth Cichlid (Acaronia nassa) was ex? plored using Blue Dextran-Sepharose Affin? ity Chromatography. Binding of LDH to the matrix occurs via the cofactor site (dinuc leotide fold), however the affinity of various isozymes for Blue Dextran varies and column behavior provides a crude meas- sure of molecular homology. Tissue homo? genates from several fish species were ap? plied to the column and eluted in turn with buffers lacking or containing free NAD or NADH and the resulting eluates eva- luated electrophoretically. LDH-B rich isozymes from all fish bound loosely and were eluted with NAD, whereas LDH-A rich isozymes could be eluated only with NADH. Eye-specific LDH-C behaved like LDH-B in all cases. The liver-specific LDH from goldfish eluted only NADH. In contrast, the liver-specific LDH from Basketmouth was barely retained and eluted quantita- tively without free cofactor. These re? sults further bolster a two gene model for the eye- and liver- specific LDH isozymes coexpressed in this fish (Holt &amp; Leibel, '87.

The relatively heavy stable carbon isotopic content of hydrothermal-vent vestimentifera (6^^C=?ll%o) does not reflect the isotopic discrimination normally associated with carbon fixation by chemoautotrophic sulfide-oxidizing bacteria. A variety of evidence supports the hypothesis that these high 5^C values are due to inorganic carbon limitation in the trophosome, where the symbiotic bacteria reside. Homogenates of trophosome tissue fix inorganic carbon at rates as high as 70 M-mol/g trophosome/hr when incubated under optimal conditions. Similarly, live animals will consume inorganic carbon at rates as high as 6 fimol/g animal/hr. Thus, the animals, and the trophosome tissue in particular have a high demand for inorganic carbon. Vestimentiferan symbionts are located in an internal organ, the trophosome, and therefore their inorganic carbon demand must be met by carbon transported through the animals circulatory system. Levels of inorganic carbon in the vascular blood of Riftia are often well below the levels found in the surrounding sea water, and we have measured concentrations in post-trophosome vascular blood as much as 500 uM lower than in the corresponding pre-trophosome vascular blood The Km of trophosome homogenates (containing intact symbionts) for inorganic carbon is between 400 and 800 JJ.M. The high carbon demand, low levels of inorganic carbon in their blood and Km of the symbionts for inorganic carbon support the hypothesis that the symbionts are carbon limited, a situation which would explain the low 6^C values of the animals. In addition the stable isotope content of two hydrothermal vent vestimentiferans Riftiftpachvptila and Tevnia jericqnana are correlated with the size of the animals, the smallest individuals having the lowest 5^C values. Values ranging from -15 to -9%o are reported for both species. These data are also consistent with a carbon limited trophosome. 700 THE HEAT SHOCK RESPONSE OF THE LEPIDOPTERAN, MANDUCA SEXTA. CM. Fittinahoff and L.M. Riddiford. Dept. of Zoology, NJ-15, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195. The heat shock response of the caterpillar, Manduca sexta. consists of the induction of several proteins resembling the heat shock proteins (hsps) first described in Drosophila. The optimal temperature of hsp induction in the epidermis is 42?C, which corresponds to the highest temperature tolerated by the caterpillars in one hour treatments. Temperatures above 42?C are accompanied by failure of secretion as evidenced by the inhibition of cuticle protein secretion in the epidermis. Unlike Drosophila. Manduca continues synthesis of non-heat shock proteins during heat shock. Synthesis of the storage protein, manducin, is, however, specifically shut off by heat shock. Tissue specific differences in variety of heat shock proteins produced at various temperatures have been seen in studies of fat body, epidermis, and imaginal discs.

Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pa. 19104. The extraccular muscles associated with thermogenesis in the heads of billfish, are modified muscle cells that are structurally distinct from all other types of muscle previously described. In this study, the modified Golgi stain, specific for the transverse tubule CT) system in muscle cells, was used to study the disposition and role of the T system in heater cells. In heater cells, the contractile filaments are virtually absent and thus there is no scaffolding, as in normal muscle cells for the membrane networks. This results in a complicated three dimensional disposition of the T network. T tubules surround the numerous mitcchondria in heater cells, and make cccasional disc-shaped junctional contacts with the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Junctional regions between T and SR appear structurally similar to junctional regions in skeletal muscle tonic fibers indicating a possible origin of heater from this fiber type. Functionally, the presence of an extensive T network allows for neuromuscular control of the heater and precise regulation of thermogenesis. 702 ADAPTIVE HYPERTHERMIA IN DESERT MAMMALS: BENEFITS AND BODY SIZE. ?JQL Osborn. University of Arizona, Tucson. I performed computer simulations which illustrate the effect of body size on the water economy and performance of diurnal desert mammals. The simulations compared mammals which use an adaptive hyperthermia strategy to save water (that is, allow body temperature to rise while foraging) with mammals which are homeothermic while foraging. The simulations used mammalian allometric expressions for heat exchange with the environment. The simulations showed that the water used by a hypothetical hyperthermic shuttling animal is less than that used by a homeothermic animal with an equivalent activity pattern and set of environmental conditions. The relative water savings achieved by using hyperthermic shuttling decrease with increasing body size. Within a single foraging/cooling cycle, the proportion of the cycle spent foraging decreases with increasing body size. This result, coupled with the high thermal inertia of large animals, means that the smallest and largest animals are able to spend the greatest proportion of daylight hours foraging; intermediate size animals gain less by shuttling. These simulations illustrate that if there is a cost to abandoning homeothermy in mammals, the smallest and largest animals would be most likely to evolve the capacity for adaptive hyperthermia as a means for water economy. 703 DOES TEMPERATURE ACCLIMATION OCCUR IN FISHES WHICH ARE SEASONALLY INACTIVE IN COLD WATER? Alan S. Kolok. Univ. of Colorado, Boulder. Eurythermal fishes which are active in cold water (&lt;7?C) often undergo biochemical acclimation, which has been considered necessary in order for the fish to maintain consistent locomotor performance. In this study, temperature acclimation in a cold water active species, the green sunfish, (Lepomis cyanellus) was compared to that in a cold water inactive species, the smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieui). It was hypothesized that the extent to which sunfish would acclimate to cold water would be greater than the bass. Fishes were acclimated to 5,15,and 25?C for ten weeks. In both species, red muscle citrate synthase activity (CS) was elevated in fish acclimated to 5 and 15?C relative to those at 25?C Similarly, red muscle area per body cross sectional area was elevated in all fish acclimated to 5?C relative to those fish at 25?C In contrast to expected results, heart ventricle CS and ventricle weight showed temperature acclimation in bass but not in sunfish. Despite notable differences in their levels of cold water activity, the similarity in temperature acclimation between green sunfish and smallmouth bass suggests that temperature acclimation may have other functions in addition to maintenance of locomotor performance. 704 SEASONAL VARIATION OF VASCULAR OXYGEN TRANSPORT IN THE DARK-EYED JUNCO. D.L. Swanson. Oregon State Univ., Corvallis. Small birds wintering in temperate climates must increase rates of aerobic metabolism to meet thermoregulatory demands. Increased oxygen delivery to the tissues and/or increased oxygen unloading at the tissues may be involved in meeting this need. This study examines seasonal variation in vascular oxygen transport of dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) from western Oregon. Oxygen dissociation curves, hematocrits, and oxygen carrying capacities were determined in summer- and winter-acclimatized juncos. Oxygen affinity did not vary season- ally, p50 values for summer and winter were 54.1 torr and 54.0 torr, respectively, at 41?C and pH 7.5. Hematocrit values averaged 47.2% in summer and 52.6% in winter and were significantly different. Mean values for oxygen carrying capacity, 13.33 vol% in summer and 14.48 vol% in winter, also differed significantly. Apparently, increased oxygen demands in winter-acclimatized dark-eyed juncos are met, in part, by increased oxygen carrying capacity, but not by decreased oxygen affinity.</page><page sequence="130">130A American Society of Zoologists 705 DEPENDENCE OF BODY TEMPERATURES AND EVAPORATIVE WATER LOSS ON ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS IN BASKING LEOPARD FROGS (RANA PIPIENS). M.P. O'Connor* and C,R, Tracy. Colorado State Univ., Fort Collins. Anesthetized leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) were exposed to artificial radiation in a wind tunnel to determine the responsiveness of body temperatures and rates of evaporation to radiation. The body temperatures attained by frogs were affected by wind speed, radiant intensity, and the nature of the substrate. Incident radiation (500 W/m2) raised frog body temperatures 3-5?C. Frogs under incident radiation came to higher equilibrium temperatures when they sat on highly conductive substrates (sand, 26?C) than on styrofoam (21 ?C). Rates of evaporative water loss were lower at low radiant loads, at low wind speeds, and on wet sand substrates. High radiant loads (500 W/m2) resulted in 40-80% increases in rates of evaporative water loss. Basking involves a trade-off between increases in body temperature attained and concommitant increases in evaporation possibly limiting the period of time which the frog can spend basking. The data suggest that basking for thermoregulation will be most thermally useful and least hydrically stressful for leopard frogs sheltered from the wind and in contact with warm, moist, highly thermally conductive soils. 706 HOT ROCKS AND NOT-SO-HOT ROCKS: THERMAL CONSEQUENCES OF RETREAT-SITE SELECTION BY GARTER SNAKES. R. B. Huey1. C. R. Peterson2, S. J. Arnold2, and W. P. Porter^. Univ. Washington*, Univ. Chicago2, and Univ. Wisconsin^. Most temperate-zone ectotherms spend much more time in retreats than active. Thus studies of thermoregulation that focus only on active animals may yield incomplete portraits of thermal biology. We document the patterns and thermal consequences of retreat site selection by garter snakes (Thamnophis elegans) during mid-summer at Eagle Lake, CA. Garter snakes usually retreat under rocks of intermediate thickness (20-30 cm). Snakes under such rocks should never overheat, should achieve preferred T^ for long periods, and can have either the highest net energy gains or the lowest overall metabolic expenditure, depending on the particular T^ they select. Snakes under thinner rocks would overheat at midday, whereas snakes under thicker rocks would not warm enough to reach their preferred 707 HIBERNATION IN ARCTIC GROUND SQUIRRELS: TEMPORAL PATTERNS AND FREEZE RESISTANCE. B.M. Barnes. Univ. Alaska Fairbanks. Burrow temperatures, body temperatures, and activity patterns were measured continuously via telemetry in Spermophilus parryii hibernating under semi-natural conditions in self-dug burrows. On average animals sealed their hibernacula on 19 Oct and emerged on 14 Apr. Reproductive males emerged 16 days earlier than females and nonreproductive males. Timing of female emergence coincided with soil isothermy. Normothermic pre-emergence intervals varied from &lt; 1 to 9 days; the data are too limited to discern sex differences in the length of this interval. Minimum burrow temperatures during winter reached -10 C in experimental burrows and -18 C in natural burrows. Core body temperatures of torpid squirrels averaged -1.9 C, range -1.1 to -2.9 C. Subzero transitions in body temperature were not accompanied by exotherms. Spontaneous arousals could be predicted several days ahead by slight (&lt;0.5 C) increases in body temperature. 708 THE USE OF AMPEROMETRIC DETECTION FOR THE STUDY OF SUGAR UPTAKE FROM SEAWATER INTO MOLLUSCAN LARVAE. J.R. Welborn and D.T. Manahan. Dept. Biol. Sci., Univ. of Southern Calif., Los Angeles, CA. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to identify and quantify individual sugars in seawater. The reduc? ing ability of carbohydrates in an alkal- ine solution was coupled with the redox reaction of copper(II) bis(phenanthroline) in a post-column reaction. The copper complex, reduced by the sugars, was then re-oxidized by an amperometric detector producing a signal with a sensitivity of approximately 5 pmoles for a single sugar. This method was used to measure the simul? taneous uptake of four sugars (1 uM each) from seawater by veliger larvae of the bivalve Crassostrea gigas and the gast? ropod Haliotis rufescens. Both species showed a net uptake of glucose and the disaccharide maltose. The influx of gluc? ose, determined by isotope techniques for ?. gigas, equalled the net flux as meas? ured by HPLC. The monosaccharide rhamnose, and the trisaccharide maltotriose, were not transported. Glucose and maltose were taken up at rates of 156 and 150 fmole/larva-hr by ?. gigas larvae, and 356 and 339 fmole/larva-hr by H_. rufescens. Larvae can remove these two sugars down to the limits of chemical detection.</page><page sequence="131">Abstracts 131A 709 A COMPARISON OF THE TRANSPORT RATES BY MARINE INVERTEBRATE LARVAE OF MONOSACC- HARIDES AND ALANINE FROM SEAWATER. S.J. Colwell and D.T. Manahan, Univ. So. Calif., Los Angeles, CA. The transport rates of several mono- saccharides and alanine were compared for echinoderm and molluscan larvae. Veligers of Haliotis rufescens transported 14C- glucose (1 uM) at 370 fmol/larva-hr; a rate which was 51% that of alanine (also at 1 uM). Glucose transport by plutei (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, Lytechinus pictus) and veligers (Crassostrea gigas) was less than 10% of the rate for alanine. Phlorizin (750 uM) inhibited 74% of 14C- glucose transport by ?. gigas larvae, suggesting that glucose transport is pre? dominantly an active process. Chromato- graphic separation, combined with radio- chemical analysis, showed that transport by CJ. gigas was specific for l4C-glucose and not a l4C-contaminant. For veligers of C. gigas and 11. rufescens, glucose was transported at the greatest rate with galactose, fructose, mannose and L-fucose being transported at less than 10% the rate of glucose. L_. pictus plutei showed a similar hierarchy for monosaccharide transport. These data indicate that larvae can transport a range of monosaccharides from seawater, but at rates lower than those for amino acids. 710 MUSSEL GROWTH SUPPORTED BY METHANE AS SOLE CARBON AND ENERGY SOURCE. S.C. Cary. Scripps Institution of Oceanography, U.C.S.D., La Jolla, Calif. 92093. Recently mussels from the hydrocarbon seepage sites off Louisiana and the brine seeps at the base of the Florida escarpment have been shown to contain methanotrophic symbionts capable of obtaining energy and carbon from the oxidation of methane. For this methanotrophic association researchers have proposed that at least part of the nutritional requirements of the respective host are supplied by the bacteria. Because of the logistics in experimenting with deep-sea organisms the extent of this nutritional dependency in the relationship is poorly understood. A computer interfaced laser diffraction measuring system was used to obtain short-term changes in growth rates of the Louisiana mussels held under controlled conditions where methane was the sole carbon and energy source. The growth rate of the mussels measurably increased within 24 hr of exposure to the lowest concentration of methane (245 umoles/liter) and a high oxygen concentration (290 umoles/liter) attaining a maximum rate of 17.2 um/day. The growth rates diminished as the methane concentrations increased and oxygen decreased. Growth approached zero in the absence of methane. These data indicate that the symbiotic bacteria provide their hosts with a net carbon flux originating from methane. Since these mussels also appear to filter feed it is uncertain at this time to what extent each food source, bacterial or particulate, plays in the overall nutritional strategy. However, the experiment presented here clearly shows that mussels, known to contain methane-oxidizing bacteria, can grow with methane as their sole carbon and energy source. 711 THE TIMING OF EGGSHELL DEPOSITION IN THE LIZARD GENUS SCELOPORUS AND THE EVOLUTION OF VIVIPARITY IN REPTILES. V.G. DeMarco. Univ. of Florida, Gainesville. The near complete or complete loss of the eggshell and shell membranes is char? acteristic of viviparous lizards. The loss of the shell is believed by some to have occurred by progressive thinning of the shell with increased duration of egg retention. Alternatively, a prolonged egg retaining species may delay the onset of shell deposition until just before ov- iposition. Eventually shelling was sup- pressed in species with complete egg re? tention. I examined the timing of shell deposition, from ovulation, in three spe? cies of Sceloporous that have different periods of egg retention, in order to re- solve the "thinning" vs "delayed onset" hypotheses. The deposition of shell fib? ers begins immediately after ovulation in !L' WOQdi&gt; S_* virgatus and S_. scalaris and is completed within three days. A period of rapid calcification follows for the next 3-4 days in S_. virgatus and JS. woodi. Additional calcium is slowly added to the shell until oviposition. The delayed onset hypothesis is unsupported by these observations. 712 NUTRITIONAL PROVISION TO EMBRYOS OF THE VIVIPAROUS SNAKE, Thamnophis ordinoides. J.R. Stewart. D.G. Blackburn, D.C. Baxter and L.H. Hoffman. Univ. Tulsa, OK., Trinity College, Hartford, CT., Univ. Colorado, Boulder and Vanderbilt Univ., Nashville, TN. Estimation of placental function in T. ordinoides by quantitative analysis of the composition of eggs and their sibling neonates revealed that the pattern of embryonic nutrition is predominantly lecithotrophic, yet the placenta is capable of providing inorganic nutrients to developing embryos. There was no evidence of organic nutrient placentotrophy. Neonates contained greater quantities of water, sodium and calcium than eggs. The pattern of placental provision of calcium was consistent with predictions for facultative placentotrophy, while placental transport of water and sodium compensated for low yolk levels of these molecules. This dual pattern of embryonic nutrition is likely to be characteristic of early stages in the evolution of squamate placentation.</page><page sequence="132">132A American Society of Zoologists 713 PROSTANOID INVOLVEMENT IN RESPONSES OF THE BODY WALL OF THE LAND SLUG ARIOLIMAX CQLUMBIANUS. I. Deyrup-Olsen and A.W. Martin. Univ. of Washington, Seattle. The body wall of Ariolimax columbianus, isolated from the head ganglia and studied ^n vitro as a sac, shows highly coordinated responses of muscle and sec? retory cells controlling its volume and output of mucus-containing fluid (Martin et al., Int. Congr. Comp. Physiol.,1988). Both muscular and secretory responses are altered by prostaglandin E (PGE , 10 to 10 M) and cyclooxygenase inhib- itors (indomethacin, ibuprofen; 10 to 10 M). For example, the fluid secretion evoked by arginine vasotocin (AVT) or mechanical stimulation of the skin is inhibited by PGE . Indomethacin enhances strongly the response to AVT, and reverses the effects of prolonged stretch on the secretory responses to mechanical stimulation. Prostanoids are known to be formed by molluscan cells, and to be involved in both neural and effector activity. In Ariolimax, as in the case of vertebrate animals, prosta? noids participate in modulating the complex interactions of nerves, gland cells, and muscles mediating the autonom? ous responses of the body wall. 714 NEURONAL MECHANISMS OF WING RETRACTION REFLEX AND ITS INTERACTION WITH SWIMMING IN THE PTER0P0D MOLLUSC CLIONE LIMACINA. Zuoshi Huang Arizona State Univ. Tempe,AZ. Tactile stimuli to the parapodium of Clione can trigger a wing retraction reflex and cause inhibition of swimming. At least 4 sensory neurons, 2 motoneurons and 1 interneuron in each pedal ganglia (identified by intracellular recording and fluorescent dye injection) show activity that mirrors the behavioral response. The sensory cells respond 1:1 to ipsilateral stimuli with brief bursts of spikes even in high Mg+ylow Ca++ saline. The motoneurons respond to bilateral stimulation by generating 5-30 see. trains of action potentials. Both sensory and motor- neurons send their axons to the ipsilateral wing. The identified interneuron has a single axon that bifurcates, with one ipsilateral branch and another branch that goes to the contralateral side through the parapedal connective. While depolariza? tion of individual sensory cell fails to inhibit swimming, induced activity in retraction motoneurons polysynaptically inhibits swim motoneurons (inhibition blocked by high Mg+Vhigh Ca** saline) . Each spike in the identified retraction interneuron produces a monosynaptic IPSP in both swim interneurons and swim motoneurons (inhibitions persist in high Mg+Vhigh Ca+* saline). Thus, the retraction interneurons may play a crucial role in switching between these two mutually exclusive behaviors. 715 A VISUALLY IDENTIFIABLE MOLLUSCAN BRAIN CELL RESPONSIVE TO EARTH- STRENGTH MAGNETIC FIELDS. K, J. Lohmann. University of Washington, Seattle. Behavioral experiments indicated that the marine mollusc Tritonia diomedea can derive directional cues from the magnetic field of the earth. The magnetic direction toward which nudibranchs spontaneously oriented in the geo- magnetic field showed recurring patterns of variation correlated with lunar phase, suggesting that the behavioral response to magnetism is modulated by a lunar rhythm. The neurophysiological mechanisms underlying magnetic field detection in this and other animals have not been established. Intracellular recordings from a large, visually identifiable neuron (Left Pedal 5) in the brain of Tritonia indicate this cell responds with enhanced eiectrical activity to changes in ambient earth-strength magnetic fields. These data provide the first clear evidence for an electrophysiologic correlate to geomagnetic field detection in an individually identifiable central neuron. 716 THE TENSILE STRENGTH OF WATER IN NATURE. A. M. Smith. Univ. of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Experiments were conducted to determine if water's tensile strength could be a limiting factor in natural situations. Whereas previous work involved only highly purified systems, the present study examines water of varying degrees of purity at ambient pressure. Water was put into tension by spinning it at high speeds in a glass capillary tube. Tension was measured by calculating the centrifugal force at the center. The strength of distilled water was variable ranging from 0.1 - 1.2 Mnm"^ (1-12 atm), with a mean of ~0.3 Mnm. Seawater shows the same variability but had a mean of ~0.2 Mnm"2, It is suggested that the variability depends on flaws in the wall of the tube and, in the case of less pure samples such as seawater, minute contaminants in the sample itself. These results are pertinent to the problem of the ascent of sap in trees, since some trees put water under a tension of up to 1 Mnm" . Also, these data suggest that cephalopod suckers are not automatically limited to 0.1 Mnm"2, as had been previously suggested. Further experiments will test if octopuses can take advantage of this strength.</page><page sequence="133">Abstracts 133A 717 MATING STRATEGIES AND SEXUAL DIMORPHISM IN THE AMPHIPOD CRUSTACEA. K.E. Conlan. National Museum of Natural Sciences, Ottawa, Canada. The comparative method is used to assess the relationship between mating strategy and sexual dimorphism in amphipod Crustacea. Males of species that synchronize mating with an environmental cue have enlarged sensory and swimming appendages for mate location, while males of asynchronous breeders have enlarged pediform appendages for mate control and defense. Many asynchronous breeders guard their mates, either by carrying them or by attending them until copulation can be achieved. Aquatic carriers are less sexually dimorphic than aquatic attenders. Terrestrial and cave-dwelling species have reduced guarding but lengthened post-molt receptivity. On the basis of sexual selection theory it is suggested that the differences in mating strategy and sexual dimorphism result from differences in opportunity for mate monopolization, generated by differences in habitat, and timing and duration of receptivity. 718 ATTRACTIVENESS, MATE CHOICE AND A SENSORY TRAP IN THE FIDDLER CRAB UCA BEEBEI. J.H. CHRISTY. Smithsonian Trop? ical Research Institute, Rep. of Panama. Certain male courtship signals may be attractive to females because they flag superior mates or defended resources. Here I describe a courtship signal that is very attractive to females but com- municates nothing about male or resource quality and does not affect female breeding decisions. The signal is a mud pillar male U. beebei sometimes build by burrows to which they attract females for mating and breeding. When courted, receptive females approach and enter burrows with pillars 50% more often than they do burrows without pillars but they stay, mate and breed in both types of burrows with equal frequency. Female choice is best predicted by burrow length and depth not the presence or ab? sence of pillars, male size or courtship vigor. Pillars are attractive because they elicit an orientation response that is vital to how crabs escape predators; the response is neither sex nor species specific. Pillars catch females in a sensory trap. They are built because of intense signal competition among males to attract females and their attractive- ness is maintained by selection for escape from predators. 719 STEREO-IMAGING OF EXTERNAL GENITALIA IN THE NEOTROPICAL vocator-COMPLEX OF FIDDLER CRABS. F.H. Bamwell. University of Minnesota, Minneapolis. SEM stereo-imaging is a valuable technic for descriptive and functional morphological analysis of male and female brachyuran copulatory structures. I have used the technic to reexamine Crane's (1975) taxonomic decision, based on limited material, to lump the Pacific species Uca ecuadoriensis ("IJ. lanigera) and IJ. schmitti and reduce the new taxon to subspecific rank, as IJ. vocator ecuadoriensis, along with the presumed trans-Isthmian geminate counterpart, IJ. X* vocator. Collections of these putative subspecies were examined from Pacific and Caribbean coasts of Costa Rica. Stereo-imaging provided exceptionally clear illustrations leading to identification of four distinctive classes of the diagnostically important gonopods and gonopores. The morphological results, along with electrophoretic and other data, are consistent with the interpretation that Crane's IJ. vocator is comprised of four separate species: IJ. vocator in the Caribbean and three Pacific forms - IJ. ecuadoriensis, IJ. schmitti, and an apparently undescribed third species. 720 MORPHOMETRY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY OF CALLINECTES ORNATUS (BRACHYURA; PORTUNIDAE) IN BERMUDA. P. A. HAEFNER, JR. ROCHESTER INST. TECHNOLOGY, ROCHESTER, NY. Data are presented for 196 crabs collected in Mullet Bay during 1981 and 1987. Carapace width including and excluding the lateral spines, body depth and male abdomen width exhibited linear and isometric growth relative to short carapace length (CSL), the independent variable. Female abdomen width, chelar propodal length, width and depth were allometric. Prepubertal (20mm CSL) and pubertal molts (30mm CSL) of males were inferred from changes in allometry of chelar propodal dimensions. Prepubertal molt of females (24mm CSL) was revealed by allometric change in abdominal width and cheliped dimensions. These changes were correlated with morphological changes in the abdomen and pleopods, and with gonadal development. Females attain puberty (45mm CSL) at terminal ecdysis.</page><page sequence="134">134A American Society of Zoologists 721 DOMINANCE, TERRITORIALITY AND MATING IN THE LOBSTER, HOMARUS AMERICANUS: A MESOCOSM STUDY. E.B. Karnofskv and HJ. Price. Dalhousie Univ., Halifax, N.S. (intro. by I. Cornman) A semi-natural benthic habitat for the lobster Homarus americanus was created in the 15 m diameter pool tank at Dalhousie University. This study is a valuable link between previous observations in small tanks and in the field. Thirty lobsters were studied using focal and census observations to determine the relationship between social dominance, use of space and mating. Mature (&gt;80 mm CL) males initiated agonistic interactions much more frequently than did other categories of lobsters notably with other mature males and females. Individuals were more likely to win interactions with otherwise dominant individuals if they were defending their own shelter, suggesting shelter- based territoriality. The most dominant male attempted to extend his territory to include four widely-spaced shelters which were large enough for mating. He often evicted other males from these shelters and disrupted their cohabitations with pre-molt females. Females sought out males in mating shelters prior to their molt, but showed a substantial degree of "fickleness". Individual females initially approached several of the top- ranking males before choosing one for cohabitation, and then periodically abandoned their mate to cohabit with other males nearby. This behavior emphasizes the importance to the males of establishing dominance and clearing the area of competing males. 722 REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN DIAPTQMUS KENAI AND D. LEPTOPUS: THE EFFECT OF N:P SUPPLY RATIOS IN IN SITU BAG EXPERIMENTS. N.M. Butler, Univ. of British Columbia, Vancouver. Four bag enclosures measuring 1.5m in diameter and 6m deep were filled with filtered lake water. Zooplankton were added to each bag to approximate lake community composition and density. Three bags were fertilized weekly with 32.9 mg KH2P04 (representing 2 ug P/l) and either 130, 324, or 518 mg NH3 (representing N:P ratios of 10:1, 25:1, and 40:1, respectively); no nutrients were added to the fourth bag. Copepods were collected weekly from each bag and reproductive condition, clutch size, sex ratios, and population density were recorded for each species. A significant enclosure effect on clutch size was observed for both species; however, there was no enclosure effect on the percent of the females that were reproductive. A significant enclosure effect was also observed for total population size of I). kenai, but not for p_. leptopus. 723 POPULATION BIOLOGY OF A COMMENSAL ISOPOD (VALVIFERA: IDOTEIDAE). T.P. Stebbins. Natural History Museum of L.A. County, Los Angeles. Colidotea rostrata is the only known commensal within the isopod suborder Valvifera, living amongst the spines of two eastern Pacific sea urchins. The population biology of C. rostrata was studied at a low intertidal area in southern California between 1984 and 1986. Isopods occurred on an average of 56.1% of the urchins at about 6 isopods per urchin. Female isopods mature sexually at a length of about 7 mm. Fecundity in C. rostrata averaged nearly 12 embryos per brood, and increased with female body size. Breeding occurs all year long in ?. rostrata, with a main reproductive period between the warmer spring and summer months. Isopods appear to grow at a rate of about 1 mm per month, with few surviving beyond 11-12 mm in body length; thus ?. rostrata appears to have a life span of about 1 year. Colidotea rostrata differs from the free-living Idoteidae in its smaller maximum size, reduced fecundity, 1:1 sex ratio, and low juvenile mortality. 724 POLYMORPHIC MALE MOLTING AHD GROWTH SCHEDULES IN A MARINE ISOPOD CRUSTACEAN. Si Baitoo*, S^ Shuster and C^ Sassaman. University of California, Riverside. Paracerceis soulpta. a Gulf of California isopod, exhibits three genetically distinct male morphotypes:0d- males are largest and possess elongated abdominal uropods; /S -males are smaller and resemble sexually mature females; y- males are smallest and resemble immatures. Females are monomorphic. Growth is determinate in this species. To examine the relationships between molt frequency, growth rate, and age at maturation, we recorded molts, intermolt body lengths and the appearance of sex organs In developing young from lines sired by&lt;*-,/3 - and y-males. Gamma- males matured most rapidly and underwent fewer molts than/3-males, who matured at an intermediate rate and underwent fewer molts than o&lt;-males, who matured most slowly and molted most. Female molting and growth rates were intermediate between/@ - and c&lt;-males. If female morphology is similar to this species1 ancestral form, Y - and fi -males appear paedomorphic while oC -males appear peramorphic. Variation in male maturation rate may contribute to the persistence of three male morphs in this species.</page><page sequence="135">Abstracts 135A 725 CLUTCH SEX-RATIO POLYMQRPHISM IN THE CLAM SHRIMP EULIMNADIA ANTLEI. Clay Sassaman. Univ. of California, Riverside. Eulimnadia antlei, like many of its congeners, is characterized by a female- biased sex ratio. In E. texana, this bias is a consequence of the combination of two features in the reproductive biology of these animals: an "autosomal", recessive, genetic factor that determines male phenotype and facultative selfing hermaphroditism among females. Females from a sexual population of E. antlei were reared to maturity in isolation, and all of them produced viable eggs. Progenies of these females were then reared to maturity. Half of the families were all-female; half consisted of mixtures of males and females in a 1:3 ratio. Females from all-female clutches produced, in turn, only female offspring. The phenomenology of clutch sex-ratio polymorphism in jE. antlei is identical to that in E. texana and is indicative of the same mechanism of sex determination. This mechanism is most likely a common, and perhaps a characteristic, feature of the genus. 726 GENETIC VARIATION IN TADPOLE SHRIMP (TRIOPS). M^ Simovich, C. Sassasman and R^ Jackson*. Univ. of San Diego and Univ. of California, Riverside. The tadpole shrimp, Triops longicaudatus has been considered to be a single, widespread, variable species with both unisexual and bisexual populations. Morphological and allozyme analysis of populations throughout the western United States revealed at least two highly divergent bisexual lineages. Unisexual populations show close affinities to one or the other lineage and thus have had multiple, independent origins. Differences between the two lineages in the plasticity of reproductive mode are suggested and may correspond to ecological conditions as they affect the relative advantages of bisexual reproduction. 727 WITHSTANDING WAVE ACTION: DRAG FORCE ON THE INTERTIDAL RED ALGA, MASTOCARPUS PAPILLATUS. Emilv Carrington. Hopkins Marine Station, Stanford University, Pacific Grove, CA. A common source of mortality for many intertidal macroalgae is detachment from the substratum during heavy wave action. Recent investigations suggest that surface texture and increased branching can increase the drag force on a thallus, rendering plants with these morphologies more vulnerable to failure. Mastocarpus papillatus is an intertidal red alga that exhibits a broad range of morphologies (varying papillae length and density, thallus thickness, degree of branching, etc). However, experiments using single female gametophyte thalli in a flow tank suggest that drag force is primarily determined by surface area of the thallus and is independent of morphology. Furthermore, diameters of stipes (where failure most often occurs) of mature thalli do not Increase in proportion to the area supported, suggesting that thalli of any morphology may be size-limited in habitats with heavy wave action. Theoretieal predictions of mortality rates will be compared to those observed in the field. 728 POPULATION AND TAXONOMIC STATUS OF THE ENDAN3ERED GRENADA DOVE (LEPTOTILA WELLSI). D.E. Blockstein. Connecticut College, New London, CT. TheGrenada Dove Is an endangered endemic restricted to the southwest peninsula of Grenada. In July 1987, the population, estimated at 100, was found only in a 500 ha. area of xeric scrub woodlands. No Grenada Doves were found in other areas of the Island where they had been previously reported. Males sang repeatedly throughout the morning and ln late afternoon. The single-note song with a steeply declining pltch and a 1-sec duration was repeated every 6-8 see. Sonagrams and plumage characters differed from those of L* rufaxiIla and L. verrauxt. There was no response to playbacks of its congeners. The Grenada Dove appears to be a distinct species. Habitat destruction threatens the existence of this bird.

J.E.King. California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. A new haul-out site of juvenile northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) has been monitored at Diablo Canyon Power Plant in San Luis Obispo County, since September 1987. The haul-out site is located on a man- made breakwater and on rocky substrate. Haul-out behavior and seasonal abundances of these animals have been studied. The largest number (50-60) individuals appear in September/October. Animals leave the site until April/May when they appear again in smaller numbers (28- 30) for their spring molt. Individually tagged animals from as far north as the Farallon Islands and as far south as San Miguel Island have been sighted. 730 ABALONE DECLINE MAY SIGNAL SHIFT IN CALIFORNIA CHANNEL ISLANDS COASTAL ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE. Gary E. Davis Channel Islands National Park, Ventura, CA. Historical and contemporary fishery harvests and fur hunting have reduced predation on kelp forest and rocky intertidal herbivores in southern California. A mass mortality of sea stars in the early 1980*5 further reduced this predation. Con? trol of herbivore populations would be expected to shift from predation to competition in response to these changes. Population densities of unhar- vested intertidal black abalone, Haliotis cracheroctii, increased to over 125 m" . Fishery harvests of subtidal abalone, H. rufescens and H. corrugata, and red sea urchins, Strongylocentrotus franciscanus, reduced their reproductive capacity relative to unharvested purple (S. purpuratus) and white (Lytechinus anamesus) sea urchins. Com? petition for food increased as purple and white ur? chin populations increased. Severe winter storms and an El Nifio event disrupted food supplies beginning in 1983. Black abalone appeared to be starving in 1986-88. 731 QF ELEPHANTS AND PARROTS: FQCUS ON THE INTEFNATIONAL WILDLIFE TRADE. S.S. Lieberman. The Humane Society of the United States, Washington, D.C. The negative impacts of the wildlife trade on biological diversity are serious, and of often unpredictable consequences. It is very dangerous to think that it can be controlled. Examples will be given of the adverse impacts on both individuals and populations of both the pet trade and the luxury products trade. Specific attention will be given to the ivory trade, which has resulted in drastic declines in elephant populations, and to the pet bird trade, which is pushing many species of parrots to the brink of extinction. There will be a focus on the econcmic and ecological fallacies behind applying concepts of sustainable developrent to either the ivory trade or the pet trade. 732 BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS AMONG SEASONAL WETLAND HABITATS OF DIFFERENT SIZE AND LOCALE BORDERING SAN FRANCISCO BAY. M. Friley. California State Univ., Hayward Island biogeography theory predicts thatlarge "Tiabitat islands* will have greater species richness than small islands, Area, extent of ponding, salinity, vegetative characteristicsandhabitat heterogeneity were analyzed as variables influencing bird species richness in seasonal wetland sites that ranged in area from 0.5 ha. to 36 ha. High variability in the num? ber of species among sites of the same or similar area suggested that differences in number of species were due largely to factors other than area. Significantly more bird species were present with medium ponding versus low or high ponding. Sites with a mixture of marsh and upland vegetation had more bird species than sites with upland or marsh vegetation. Sites with medium dense vegetation had more bird species than sites with sparse or dense vegetation. No clear relationship existed between salinity and bird species richness. A relatively strong relationship existed between habitat heterogeneity and bird species richness. Sites that were relatively heterogeneous, with ponding, vegetation type and density of vegetation as compo? nents of heterogeneity, had significantly more bird species than sites that were relatively homogeneous. If a management goal is to preserve the greatest number of species, then a good management strategy might be to manage for increased habitat hetero? geneity; site specific biological knowledge and study must also be considered.</page><page sequence="137">Abstracts 137A 733 CHANGES IN HARD BOTTOM COMMUNITIES RELATED TO BOAT MOORING AND TRIBUTYLTIN IN SAN DIEGO BAY; A NATURAL EXPERIMENT. H.S. Lenihan. J.S. Oliver and M.A. Stephenson. Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, Moss Landing. The effects of many boats and TBT (tributyltin: a toxic additive to paint) were evaluated in San Diego Bay by sampling a unique natural experiment involving replicate embayments with similar hydrographic environments but dramatically different numbers of boats. Embayments with many boats contained depauperate hard bottom or fouling communities compared to similar embayments with few boats. Embayments with many boats were characterized by serpulid polychaete worms, filamentous algae and a solitary tunicate, Ciona intestinalis. These groups apparently tolerated the physical and chemical stresses associated with many boats, but were outcompeted for space by other sessile invertebrates in embayments with few boats, including mussels, sponges, bryozoans and other tunicates. Unlike the sessile organisms, the motile crustaceans and polychaetes that nestled among the sessile groups were strongly associated with micro- habitats such as patches of algae and dense serpulid mats rather than embayments with many or few boats. However, there were more species of nestling invertebrates in embayments with few boats. Sampling was confined to back bay areas. Hard bottom communities at the front of embayments were similiar to back bay areas where there were few boats. TBT levels were also higher in embayments with many boats, where mortality and growth deformities of young oysters were higher. 734 TRACE ORGANIC AND TRACE METAL CONTAMI- NANTS IN FISH FROM MONTEREY BAY: THE MONTEREY BAY MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SURVEY. B.A. WeJLden, M^. Martin*. and G.A. Pollock*. Univ. Calif. Santa Cruz; Calif. Dept. Fish &amp; Game, Monterey; and Calif. Dept. Health Services, Sacramento. The Monterey Bay Marine Environmental Health Survey is a 2 phase study to de? termine the concentrations of trace or? ganic and trace metal contaminants in edible tissue from popular sport and com- mercial fish from Monterey Bay. In phase one, Vhite Croaker, Genvonemu9 lineatus were sampled from a large regional ocean sewer outfall, where domestic and indus- trial chemicals are discharged, and Star- ry Flounder Platichthvs stellatus were sampled from the Moss Landing Harbor area, where elevated levels of agricul- tural chemicals have been measured. Five composite samples of each species were analyzed for over 120 chemicals. Chemi? cals detected in these samples at suffi- ciently high levels were selected as tar? get chemicals for phase two of the study. In phase two, a wide range of different sport and commercial fish were analyzed for the target chemicals identified in phase one. Results will be used by the State Dept. of Health Services to conduct a health risk assessment of consumption of fish from Monterey Bay. 735 THE EFFECTS OF DENSITY ON COLONIZATION OF THE PRAIRIE VOLE, MICROTUS OCHROGASTER. M.S. Gaines, M.L. Johnson* and B.J. Danielson*. University of Kansas, Lawrence. Three 0.8 ha vole-proof fenced enclosures were used to study the effects of density on the fitness components of dispersing prairie voles, Microtus ochrogaster over an 18 month period. Enclosure E contained a resident population from which dispersers were allowed to emigrate through exit tubes. Half of the dispersers were allowed to colonize enclosure B containing a high density resident population; the other half were allowed to colonize enclosure C containing a moderate density population which was maintained by cropping. Dispersers from enclosure E were not a random subset ofthe resident population. A comparison of differences in reproductive activity and survival rates between residents and colonists on enclosures B and C suggests that density of a resident population does affect the reproductive success of colonizing voles. 736 SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF GOPHER TORTOISES. H.R. Mushinskv.E.D. McCoy.and D.S.Wilson. Univ. of South Florida, Tampa. We examined the relationship between active Gopherus polyphemus burrow distributions and the area occupied by those populations. Our total sample of populations (n=45) includes several large tracts on federal lands in Florida. The number of active burrows/area shows a significant relationship however, the density of active burrows is not a function of area. Likewise, the density of active burrows is not a function of the number of active burrows. When we remove the federal lands from these analyses the results change in a manner that has important management implications. The number of active burrows/area is significant and the density of active burrows is again not a function of area, however now the density of active burrows is a function of the number of active burrows. These results indicate that tortoises are distributed differently on small habitat islands than on large tracts of land.</page><page sequence="138">138A American Society of Zoologists 737 TEMPORAL VARIATION IN THE ABUNDANCE OF A SUBTROPICAL DEEP-WATER ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITY SAMPLED FROM A FIXED OCEAN SITE, WITH ASPECTS OF THEIR FEEDING AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY. Ann Hillmann-Kitalona (intro. by J. Brock) Univ. of Hawaii, Hawaii. Fine-scaled sampling from a fixed point in the ocean, has provided a unique opportunity to study temporal variation in a deep-water zooplankton community. During the spring of 1986, zooplankters were sampled every 2 hours, for 24 hours, on alternate days, for 34 days, from a deep-water pipeline (586 m) at the National Energy Laboratory of Hawaii at Keahole Point. Significant morning increases in the mean settling volume and abundances of many zooplankters occurred, especially during new and full moons. Scottocalanus securifrons females had more gut material than males. The proportion of Eucalanus crassus males with full guts increased from late morning to early afternoon. Sex ratios were skewed towards females for all copepod species examined except Phyllopus spp. A total of 107 attached spermatophores were observed primarily from S. securifrons, E. curticauda, Undeuchaeta spp., and Euchirella pulchra. More males and attached spermatophores were observed during new moon. Predictable temporal periodicities in the abundance, feeding and reproduction exist for a zooplankton community below the thermocline. 738 GLOBAL SURVEY OF DEVELOPMENTAL MODE IN THE BROODING BIVALVE LASAEA. D. O^Foighil Univ. of Victoria, Victoria, B.C. Members of the intertidal, near-cosmo- politan mollusc genus Lasaea brood their young either to a planktotrophic veliger or crawl away juvenile stage of developm? ent. Developmental mode can be reliably inferred from prodissoconch structure and by examination of brood masses. To date, I have examined ^"200 museum samples and have detected planktonic larvae in the Australian species, L^ australis. Congen- ers from all sites, including many ocean- ic islands, release their young as crawl away juveniles. In benthic marine invert? ebrates that are sedentary as adults, a planktonic larval development is thought to greatly enhance a species' geographic range. Present results, however, indicate that 1) planktonic larvae are not necess? ary for long distance Lasaea dispersal; 2) rafting has played an important role in the sucess of this genus; 3) Lasaea with crawl away young may have greater geographic ranges than congeners with planktonic larvae and appear more sucess- ful in utilizing chance rafting events to colonize new areas. 739 THE IMPORTANCE OF SIZE AT FIRST REPRODUCTION, ALLOMETRY, AND SEASONAL VARIATION IN CLUTCH SIZE STRUCTURE OF BROODING BIVALVES. M.P. Russell. University of California, Berkeley. The small (&lt;7mm) venerid bivalve, Transennella confusa. broods it's developing embryos and early juvenile stages in the mantle cavity. Through a series of monthly dissections, I documented seasonal variation in fecundity and clutch size structure for a population at Pillar Point Harbor, California. Fecundity is a function of adult size and there were no significant differences among the spring, summer or fall regressions of brood number versus adult length; however, fecundity levels are substantially decreased in the winter. The size structure of broods also varies seasonally but not in the same manner as fecundity. The spring samples are dominated by the smallest size class of embryos (75%), this proportion drops to 50% in the summer and fall. In the winter, the largest size classes of embryos make up most of the brood. When examining the allometric relationship between adult size and brooding, it is essential to adjust the allometric equation for size at first reproduction. Neglecting this term in the equation results in significantly overestimating the allometric coefficient. In addition, when discussing the constraints of brooding, it is important not only to consider the absolute number of individuals in any clutch, but also the relative proportions of developmental stages. 740 MALE-BIASED SEX RATIO AND PLANULA- TION SUCCESS IN THE CARIBBEAN GOR- GONIAN, BRIAREUM ASBESTINUM. D.A. Brazeau. SUNY at Buffalo, Buffalo, N.Y. Briareum asbestlnum is a common gorgonian of Caribbean reefs. Studies conducted from 1985 to 1988 at the Smithsonian Tropical Re? search Institute field station in the San Bias Islands, Panama have shown that _B. asbestinum is gono- choric and broods its larvae ex- ternally. Production of planulae by females is low. Only 42.6% (N=101) and 35% (N=41) of the fe? male colonies monitored released planulae in 1986 and 1987. Histo- logic examination of polyps before and after planulation and counts of planulae released show that only 5.7% and 6% of all mature eggs pre? sent developed into planulae in 1986 and 1987. Samples collected from numerous reefs show a skewed sex ratio in favor of males (1.8:1, N=267). It is proposed that the male-biased sex ratio has arisen as a means of increasing male density around female colonies and thus increasing fertilization success.</page><page sequence="139">Abstracts 139A 741 REPRODUCTIVE AND LARVAL BIOLOGY OF TWO TROPICAL HOLOTHURIANS. D.R Hopper, and R.H. Richmond Marine laboratory, University of Guam, Guam Holothuria nobilis and Actin- opygia mauritiana are commer- cially valuble tropical sea cuc- umber species. Both are dioe- cious, but show different sea? sonal spawning cycles. Males bear active sperm throughout the year while females exhibit a summer spawning period. Female spawning occurs when the mean gonadal index reaches 2.0% and 7.9% of whole wet body weight of the two species respectively. Zygotes undergo blastulation by unipolar ingression, reaching a blastula stage in one day. A plankto? trophic auricularia stage is reached between days 3 and 4. Settlement occurs following dev? elopment of the doliolaria stage at 8-9 d. Planktonic forms per- sisted up to 21 days after fertilization. 742 THE INFLUENCE OF REDUCED EGG SIZE ON DEVELOPMENT RATE AND MORTALITY OF ECHINOID LARVAE. L.R. McEdvard. University of Washington, Seattle. Experimental manipulations (blastomere separations) provide a method for testing directly the effect of egg size on rates of larval development. Echinoid larvae that develop from (experimentally produced) smaller eggs are smaller and develop slower through the early feeding larval stages but grow to normal size prior to metamorphosis. Reduced rates of development are largely due to decreased feeding capability in smaller larvae and the need to grow more to reach normal size. One cost of reduced development rate is greater mortality from planktonic predation, especially during the early stages. A benefit of smaller eggs is increased fecundity. Quantitative modelling shows that the mortality costs associated with development from smaller eggs can offset increased fecundity. In contrast to predictions of life history theory, the number of offspring that metamorphose is potentially independent of egg size over a range of levels of parental investment, and selection need not favor extreme egg sizes. 743 FACTORS INFLUENCING FERTILIZATION SUCCESS AND FECUNDITY IN THE SEA URCHIN DIADEMA ANTILLARUM PHILIPPI. D.R. Levitan Univ. of Delaware, Newark. Fecundity is generally estimated as the number of ganetes produced per individual. However, both gamete production and fertilization determine the fecundity of sexually reproducing organisms. The number of ganetes produced per individual is primarily a function of body size. For external spawners, individual fertilization success is a function of spawning frequency, aggregative behavior, population density, distance between individuals, and water flow. The relative importance of these factors are investigated in a series of field experiments. The results indicate that fertilization success is as critical a life history process as gamete production. Therefore, estimates of fecundity based on gamete number or gonad size can be misleading. 744 DRIFTING AS AN IMPORTANT DISPERSAL AND RECRUITMENT MECHANISM IN SMALL INTERTIDAL INVERTEBRATES. A,. Martel. Bamfield Marine Station, B.C. &amp; Univ. Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. A dispersal study of marine invertebrates has revealed that many species, particularly those adapted to algal habitats, can be found drifting in the vater column as small juveniles or even as reproductive adults. More than 17 species (11 gastropods, 5 bivalves and 1 echinoderm) have been found in collectors placed intertidally in semi-exposed areas and subtidally in Macrocystis kelp beds. Among these, 7 have benthic, direct development vith cravl-avay juveniles. The ability to drift as post-metamorphic stages may be an important dispersal mechanism in these species. In spite of the absence of a planktonic larval stage, all of these species have vide geographic distributions. Future recruitment and population studies on small intertidal invetebrates should take into account drifting as an important factor influencing patterns of distribution and abundance independently of their mode of larval development.</page><page sequence="140">140A American Society of Zoologists 745 BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS AND MISINTER- PRETATIONS OF THE EVOLUTION AND ECOLOGY OF MARINE COMMUNITIES: TRANSOCEANIC DISPERSAL OF NON- OCEANIC LARVAE AND HOLOPLANKTON. J. T. Carlton, Univ. of Oregon, Eugene. Near-shore marine communities around the Pacific Ocean rim are continously inoculated with plankton released in sea-water ballast of cargo vessels from Japan, in directions and over time scales radically different from those achievable by natural dis? persal processes. Vessels inter- cepted at Coos Bay, Oregon, have yielded over 200 taxa, many of whose inoculation rates and den? sities have been measured. Post- transport (15d) viability and competence have been demonstrated by experimental settlement of polychaete, mollusc, bryozoan, and other larvae. The distribution of potentially 1000s of species of neritic animals and plants has been altered in the past 100 yr by ballast water, making many modern evolutionary-biogeographic inter? pretations of species origins and community structure moot. 746 "LARVAL ECOLOGY" IN THE DEEP SEA: INN0VATI0NS AND REN0VATI0NS. J.L. Cameron and C.M. Young. Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution, Ft. Pierce, FL. Direct in situ observations of processes relating to the ecology of the embryos and larvae of deep-sea invertebrates are virtually impossible to make. I_n vitro observations and experiments on these life stages suffer from constraints associated with extrapolating laboratory data to ecological reality. These same constraints apply to similar studies of shallow-water invertebrates, but such studies in the deep sea are plagued with additional confounding problems resulting from increased depth (ie. decreasing temperature, increasing pressure, reduced nutrients, and limited accessibi1ity). Efforts to overcome these constraints within the deep sea can be quite costly and present their own unique problems. We report our efforts at 1_n_ si tu and col lateral i_n vitro experimentation upon the embryos and larvae of bathyal echinoderms (predominately asteroids and echinoids). We discuss the frustrations of the design and construction phase and the successes and failures in the deployment and recovery of experimental apparatus intended to address questions concerning the ecology of the embryos and larvae of deep-sea invertebrates. 747 FRONTAL ORGANS IN THE NEMERTO- DERMATTDA (TURBELLARIA). J.P.S. Smith III and S. Tyler. Univ. N. Caroiina, Charlotte, and Univ. Maine, Orono. Like the acoel turbellarians, members of the Nemertodermatida have frontal glands grouped in a specific pattern that constitutes a true frontal organ definable by ultrastructural characters. Nemertoderma sp. and Flagellophora sp., for instance, have necks of more than a dozen mucoid frontal glands emergent at the exact anterior pole of the animal. The glands open through a bunched group of pores among several pole cells, specialized epidermal cells at the convergence of the pattern of general epidermal cilia. Other types of frontal glands emerge separately from the pole cells as do mono- and multiciliated sensory receptors. This morphology fits Graff s hypothesis of frontal organ evolution, representing a plesiomorphic condition in which originally separate body-wall glands become grouped apically. The frontal organ is thus yet another autapomorphy for the Acoelomorpha as a whole.

Biology Dept., Univ. of Victoria, B.C, Canada. In scaphopods, inhalent and exhalent respiratory currents pass through the posterior aperture, at the apex of the shell. The underlying mantle is developed into a siphon-like extension termed the pavilion, which is internally demarcated from the mantle cavity by a collar of tissue at its base. Several types of ciliated sensory receptors occur in this area of mantle epithelium, and their structure and distribution has been examined in Dentalium rectius Carpenter 1864 using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Pitted receptors, with 2-6 cilia of ~1.7|im length, line the periphery of the pavilion. A second type, consisting of a rigid bundle of 20- 40 cilia with a length of ~12u.ni, are present on the inner surface of the apex, and on the collar at the pavilion base. A band of motile cilia separates the two types near the pavilion edge and may facilitate receptor function. Many receptors consisting of 1-2 cilia, ~8u\m in length, are also scattered inside this band. Neural processes extend from the cilia, which have a typical 9+2 microtubular arrangement. Their structure and distribution is similar to peripheral chemo- and mechanosensory receptors which sample respiratory currents and the surrounding marine environment in other molluscan classes.</page><page sequence="141">Abstracts 141A 749 WHAT AND HOW A BRYOZOAN LARVA "SEES." R.L. Zimmer. Univ. of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089. Most coronate bryozoan larvae are provided with pigment cup ocelli and, on release, are initially photopositive. There is no information on the nature of the shielding and visual pigments or on the functional consequences of the organization, number and placement of these simple ciliary-based ocelli. Absorption spectra from microspectrophotometry of living larvae of Bugula and Watersipora indicate that the shielding pigments are carotenoids with absorption maxima ideal for masking a rhodopsin-based visual system. To determine the visual field of a given eyespot (its cone of vision and the axis of that cone), reconstructions were made from SEMs and serial 1 nm sections. The findings suggest that the ocelli are redundant in number, but are not ideally positioned in some cases: the integration of sensory input during one or more rotations of a larva is apparently needed for the observed phototactic responses. 750 FUNCTIONAL ORGANIZATION OF THE ASCIDIAN NEURAL GLAND COMPLEX. E.JE. Ruppert and J_.- J_. Ma_. Clemson Univ., "Clemson, S.C. Urochordates have, associated with the brain, a blind-ending duct which opens ex- ternally to the sea. The duct is well dev? eloped in ascidians and consists of three connected parts: a complexly-folded cil? iated funnel (dorsal tubercle) which opens from the pharynx, a ciliated duct, and a blind sac (neural gland) situated below the brain in a blood sinus. The neural gland is neither neural nor glandular but instead consists of a spongy cellular mass of putative phagocytes. Suspended particulates placed on the ciliated fun? nel are rejected by surface cilia but sea? water (and soluble dyes) are transported continuously and unidirectionally inward where they pass through the neural gland and enter the blood. The results indicate that blood volume is regulated by ciliary pumping of seawater along a duct bearing coarse (ciliated funnel) and fine (neural gland) filters. Functionally, the ascid? ian system resembles the madreporite, stone canal, and Tiedemann's bodies assoc? iated with the water vascular system of some echinoderms. Structurally, it is sim? ilar to the cephalochordate preoral pit and the vertebrate nasohypophyseal duct and sac. Supported by NSF Grant No. BSR- 8408500 to E.E.

The epicardium (EP) of ascidians arises as a pair of endodermal evaginations at the base of the pharynx and is presumed to be a coelomic homolog based upon classical light microscopic investigations (eg., Berrill, 1936; 1950). To further elucidate its organization, we examined the ultrastructure of the EP and its derivatives in representatives of the 3 orders: Ciona intestinalis (Phlebobranchia), Clavelina oblongata (Aplousobranchia), Molqula manhattensis (Stolidobranchia). EP lining of ?.. intestinalis is composed of squamous epithelial cells possessing scattered apical microvilli, well developed RER, Golgi bodies, secretory vesicles and basal mtcrofilaments. EP lining of ?.. oblongata consists of squamous to cuboidal epithelial cells characterized by Golgi bodies, electron lucent or electron dense (secretory) vesicles and numerous glycogen granules. The renal sac of CL. manhattensis. an EP derivative, is lined by cuboidal transportive epithelial cells possessing basolateral infoldings, numerous mitochondria, golgi bodies, electron lucent and electron dense (secretory) vesicles and apical microvilli. Ultracytochemistry reveals the presence of Na++K+-ATPase associated with the basal infoldings. In all three orders, cells of the EP are interjoined by tight junctions and rest on a thick basal ECM. Results reveal that cells lining the EP compare favorably to peritoneal cells of other triploblastic metazoans, thus corroborating the view that the EP is a coelomic homolog. Results also reveal the secretory nature of the EP, supporting Berrill's (1936; 1950) view that the EP may function in excretion within all 3 orders, in addition to being a source of stem cells. 752 THE EXCRETORY ROLE OF METANEPHRIDIA IN THEMISTE ALUTACEA (SIPUNCULA). Deborah Y. Pinson and Edward E. Ruppcrt. Department of Bi? ological Sciences, Clemson Univ., SC. A metanephridium is a ciliated duct which opens intemally at a ciliated funnel and extemaily at a simple pore. Typically, mctanephridia have an excretory func? tion; they modify filtered vascular fluids by seiective re? absorption and secretion to form urine. In sipunculans, there is no convincing evidence that the metanephridia are capable of modifying body fluids. The objective of this study is to provide ultrastructural evidence for an excretory function in sipunculan ncphridia. Themiste aluiacea possesscs two elongate, muscular, saclikc mctanephridia suspended in a spacious trunk coelom. The nephridial funnel is situated near the single anterior attachment of the nephridium to the dorsal body wall and pore. The duct is lined with transportive epithelial cells which are modified apicaliy for absorption and basaily for secretion. Apicaliy, the plasmalemma bears ciha, microvilli, and coated pits and the cytoplasm contains coated and uncoated vesicles, tubules, endosomes, and putative lysosomes. Basaily, the cell membrane is char? acterized by extensive infoldings and mitochondria. A layer of smooth muscle and connective tissue overlies the lining epithelium. Interdigitated peritoneal ceUs, some of which bear multiple cilia, cover the coelomic surface of the nephridia. Electron-dense macromolecular traccrs (iron dextran, native ferritin) injected into the coelomic cavity appear in the nephridial duct. The tracers are rc- absorbed by endocytosis and are found in vesicles and endosomes in the apical cytoplasm of the lining epithelium. These data suggest that the nephridia of T. alutacea modify bodily fluids by reabsorption and se? cretion, thus supporting their excretory role. Supported in part by NSF Grant no. BSR-8408500 to E.E.

Univ. of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The branchial epithelium of Carcinus maenas has been examined by light and electron microscopy, and five cell types have been identified. Chief cells, stri- ated cells, and pillar cells contact the cuticle of the gill plate. The chief cells exhibit a pale cytoplasm with numer- ous mitochondria. They are the principal epithelial cells and likely involved in respiration. The striated cells are basally folded and interdigitated with neighboring cells. Mitochondria align within the narrow folds to produce the vertical striae that distinguish these cells in sections. Localized near the excurrent hemolymph vessel, the striated cells are the putative ionoregulatory cells of the epithelium. The pillar cells link the proximal and distal surfaces of the gill plate, disrupting the continuity of the hemocoel. Nephrocytes and glyco- cytes reside within the basal lamina of the branchial epithelium but never come into contact with the cuticle. The neph? rocytes display massive central vacuoles, and they tend to develop foot-processes (pedicels) on those surfaces that face the hemocoel. The glycocytes are pleomorphic cells packed with glycogen granules. 754 ELECTROMYOGRAPHY OF THE FIN MUSCULATURE OF THE CUTTLEFISH. W.M. Kier, K.K. Smith, and J.A. Miyan*. Univ. of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Duke Univ., and Univ. of Edinburgh, Scotland. The musculature of the fins of Sepia officinalis (Mollusca, Cephalopoda) was studied with electromyography (EMG) in order to test predictions of the func? tional role of the various muscle masses. Previous research had shown the fins to consist of a tightly packed, three-dimen- sional array of muscle and revealed dis? tinct zones of "red" and "white" muscle. By recording EMGs from the various muscle bundles in the fin in conjunction with the output from an electronic movement moni- toring device, we correlated muscle activ? ity with both the phase and intensity of the fin beat cycle. The EMGs support models of the function of "red" muscle fibers in producing gentle fin movements and of a network of crossed oblique con? nective tissue fibers in providing skele? tal support. The results also confirmed predictions of the role of "white" muscle fibers both in producing vigorous fin movements and in providing support for that movement. This study provides the first EMG test of models of the role of the complex musculature of "muscular- hydrostats" in both producing movement and providing skeletal support. 755 A PHYSICAL MODEL OF AQUATIC LOCOMOTION MIMICS CHANGES DURING ARTEMIA/S LARVAL DEVELOPMENT. T.A.Williams. Univ.o f Washington, Seattle. Artemia larvae develop by gradual growth and sequential addition of appendages. Upon hatching they swim with a single pair of principal oars, the second antennae. Through development additional pairs of limbs become functional until the adult complement of limbs is reached. The animal's growth brings it gradually from a viscous fluid regime into an inertial one. The antennae, the primary oars, must cope not only with a variation in their swimming strategy this shift forces, but also must function, kine- matically, both alone and in synchrony with more and more pairs of appendages. Based on data from high speed films of various stage larvae, I have constructed an articulated physical model of the antenna, driven by servo motors to translate and stroke through a tank of glycerin. This mimics the behavior of the limbs at different larval stages by maintaining certain physical characteristics of the fluid environment. I record force and kinematic data to make a direct comparison of both the time course of force production at different stages and the flow field the appendage generates. Anamorphic development appears continuous: the antennae retain both their basic geometry and stroke cycle throughout larval development. This apparent continuity may mask functional dis- continuities encountered as the limbs synch with an increasing number of oars and enter a progressively more inertial physical environment. 756 EVOLUTIONARY MORPHOLOGY OF THE LOCOMOTOR APPARATUS IN ARACHNIDA Jeffrey W. Shultz. Ohio State Univ., Columbus The skeleton and muscles of the prosoma and walking legs of representatives from all arachnid orders were examined to discover characters for phylogenetic analysis and to reveal trends in the functional morphology of locomotion. Arachnids were found to have three methods of propulsive leg extension: hydraulic, muscular and elastic. Results of phylogenetic analyses indicate that leg extension produced by pressure generated in the prosoma is primitive for Arachnida but that a specialized form of this mechanism arose independently in Araneae and Uropygi. Extensor muscles evolved only once in Arachnida and persist in Scorpiones, Pseudoscorpiones and Opiliones. Propulsion in Solifugae is accomplished by elastic sclerites that deform during flexion, storing energy that is returned during extension.' Analysis of other characters, however, indicate that solifuge ancestors used muscular leg extension, suggesting that arachnids with intrinsic methods of leg extension are monophyletic. The phylogenetic and functional implications of this study differ substantially from other recent views on arachnid evolution.</page><page sequence="143">Abstracts 143A 757 PARAPHYLY AND POLYPHYLY. D.C. Cannatella. Louisiana State Univ., Baton Rouge. The rejection of paraphyletic taxa by clad- ists is a major obstacle to the acceptance of phylogenetic principles by most system- atists. In view of this, one might suppose that there was agreement on definitions such as paraphyly and polyphyly, but there is not. Monophyletic groups are systems, but paraphyletic and polyphyletic groups are classes, whose definitions have been based on (1) the type of similarity used to group taxa (Hennig, 1966), (2) inclusion of the stem species in the group (Ashlock, 1971), and (3) evolution of a group membership character (Farris, 1974). Each of these criteria is useful, but none is sufficient to provide meaningful definitions of paraphyly and polyphyly. A consideration of outgroups, character evolution and the arbitrary nature of the optimization algorithm used by Farris provides a partial solution to the problem. 758 PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS IN THE CODING OF PARASITE CLADOGRAMS FOR THE INFERENCE OF HOST RELATIONSHIPS. R.T. O'Grady. NMNH, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. When a parasite cladogram is treated as a multistate character of the hosts in order to infer host relationships, the occurrence of more than one parasite taxon per host taxon makes it necessary to combine those parasite codes when constructing the character matrix from which the host cladogram is built. The existing procedure, termed inclusive ORing, can distort the parasite cladogram and thereby produce an incorrect host cladogram. This distortion occurs because inclusive ORing always gives precedence to derived codes, regardless of their distribution in the matrix. The solution lies in giving precedence to derived codes only when they are autapomorphic or shared by parasites that are sister taxa. This is a coding-level solution; another solution may lie at the algorithm-level, implemented by PAUP 3.0 polymorphism analysis. 759 PREDICTIVE VALUE OF CONSISTENCY INDICES IN COEVOLUTIONARY STUDIES Gregory ?h Klassen. University of Toronto and Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, Canada. Brooks' mapping technique is being used with increased frequency in coevolutionary studies. Several recent studies have made use of consistency indices (c.i.'s) as "rough" indices of degree of co-speciation. These studies prompted the following analysis designed to determine to what degree c.i.'s predict co-speciation. 20 case studies, taken from the literature, were used. The (statistical) null hypothesis of no relationship between host and parasite phylogenies was tested. The data were analysed under two alternative assumptions: 1-only synapomorphies consijrdered refuting evidence, 2-both synapomorphies and branch points 'supported' only by homoplastic characters considered refuting evidence. Only under the first assumption was a significant (p=0.05) relationship between c.i.'s and evidence for co-speciation found. This relationship is expressed as a simple linear regression with a positive slope less than one and a positive intercept. Presence/absence of autapomorphies influenced the intercept but not the slope of regression. 760 TIME AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF BIOTAS IN NORTH AMERICA. Robert T. Allen. Univ. Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR. The objective of the study was to determine if and when the 600 million year geological and climatological history of North* America affected the distribution patterns of extant biotas. Major events, such as the Rocky Mountain uplift in the Miocene, may have divided biotas and/or individual taxon populations within biotas. Major geological events from the Pennsylvanian until the present were considered in respect their effect on North America, i.e. what land areas were positive, what happened to the climate, etc. The geological events were then correlated with taxon cladograms of a number of organisms. Certain historical events are identified as contributors to present day biotic distribution patterns. There also appears to be a limited number of distribution patterns that would account for most of the evolution of the endemic biota of North America.</page><page sequence="144">144A American Society of Zoologists 761 PROBLEMS IN THE NARRATIVE REPRE- SENTATION OF EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY. Robert I. Q'Harar Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA. Prose accounts of the evolutionary past are as much works of narrative history as they are works of science. Awareness of the narrative aspects of evolutionary writing leads to the discovery of a host of fascinating and hitherto unrecognized problems in the representation of evolutionary history, problems associated with the writing of narrative. These problems include closure, privilege, sequencing, foregrounding and backgrounding, and the selection of events. Para- phyletic groups, for example, may be seen as devices which promote narrative sequencing and closure, and which uphold a particular canon of evolutionary events. Narrative writing may impose its own structure upon a real historical subject until the distinction is blurred between the structure imposed by the narrative and the structure inherent in the subject itself. If we are conscious of the ways in which narrative writing imposes upon us particular ways of looking at history, we will be better able to decide whether such impositions should be permitted. It may be necessary for evolutionary historians to develop new and creative ways of representing natural history in prose. 762 EXOGENOUS BOVINE GROWTH HORMONE (BGH) INCREASES BODY WEIGHT AND LENGTH OF trout. f.C. Leung,1 J3L. Afremathy*,2 and M. Welt*.2 1Pacific Northwest Laboratory, Richland, Washington 2University of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho. The objective of this study is to examine the effects of exogenous bGH on body weight and length in young growing trout reared in optimal water tempera? ture and feeding conditions. One hundred trout (15-20 g) were separated into four treatment groups of 25 fish each and maintained in a single circular indoor tank in a light- and temperature- controlled room. The four treatment groups were: (1) saline vehicle control; (2) bGH, 0.1 ug/fish; (3) bGH, 1.0 Ug/ fish; and (4) bGH, 10.0 Ug/fish. Fish received weekly injections, and body weight and length were measured and recorded weekly for 8 weeks. At that time, Group 4 fish had greater weight gain and length than control fish. In a replicate experiment, fish from both Groups 3 and 4 had significantly in? creased weight gain and length. In both experiments, vehicle controls showed a &gt;200% gain over their initial body weight. Exogenous administration of bGH can increase body weight and length in fast-growing trout reared in optimum environment. 763 RADOIMMUNOASSAY OF SALMON GROWTH HORMONE (GH) USING RECOMBINANTCHUM SALMON GH.

Al? though pure preparations of native GH have been used to develop a salmon GH RIA (Bolton et al. 1986; Gen Comp Endocrinol, 62:230), variation in solubility of different preparations of GH has caused variation in GH RIAs among different laboratories. Since a large amount of highly soluble recombinant GH can be distributed to various laboratories for RIA, consistency among laboratories would be more likely. This work was done to validate the salmon GH RIA using recombinant GH. Antibodies to native chum GH were used with recombi? nant chum GH label and standards. Reactivity of the standards were parallel with purified chum, coho, chinook and Atlantic salmon GH. GH from carp, yellow- tail, bonito and tuna did not give parallel reactivity. No cross-reactivity was obtained with purified salmon prolactin or gonadotropin I or II. Parallel reactivity of pituitary extracts or plasma was obtained with salmonid fish, but not with English sole. Hypophysec- tomized Atlantic salmon (2 weeks) had eight-fold lower plasma levels compared to controls. These re? sults suggest that the recombinant salmon GH may be substituted for native GH for a valid salmon GH RIA. Advantages of using the recombinant GH RIA include high GH solubility, high recoveries of label during radio-iodination, and the potential for uniformity of results among different laboratories.

The Children's Hosp Kempe Res Ctr and Univ Colorado, Denver and Boulder, CO. IGF-I is a "7.5kD peptide which mediates the mitogenic actions of growth hormone(GH) and prolactin(PRL) in vertebrates, and circulates tightly complexed to IGF-BP. In an ongoing study of these proteins in anurans, we have measured plasma IGF-I levels by RIA and IGF-BP activity by ligand-binding assay using a synthetic hIGF-I standard. IGF-I levels (1-13 ng equiv/ml) and IGF-BP activity (5-69 specific %B) varied according to species and life-cycle phase. Since the liver is postulated to be a major source for IGF-I and IGF-BP, production of these proteins were studied in Bufo woodhousei liver explants cultured in serum-free medium in the presence of bovine GH or PRL. After 24 hrs, IGF-I was detectable in the media (10-30 ng equiv/g tissue wt) and was not dependent on bGH or bPRL dose. Media IGF-BP activity peaked at a bGH dose of 250/ng/ml and showed a biphasic response to bPRL with peaks at 100 and 1000 ng/ml. Our studies demonstrate IGF-I and IGF-BP in anurans and contradict reports suggesting absence of IGF-BP in nonmammalian species.</page><page sequence="145">Abstracts 145A 765 IMMUNOLOCALIZATION OF IGF-I IN THE BOVINE OVARY AND UTERUS. B.C. Delidow and JJ? Dorrington*. Dept. of Medical Research, Univ. of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario. Insulin-like growth factor-l (IGF-I) is produced by granulosa cells in culture and is known to affect their function. Whole ovarian and uterine homogenates also contain IGF-I and its mRNA, but little is known of IGF-I localization in the intact organs. We have used indirect immunoperoxidase staining to detect IGF-I in paraff in sections of Bouin's-fixed bovine ovaries and uterus. In the ovary, IGF-I immunoreactivity is present in granulosa cells of all sizes of follicles, even the primordial stage. Theca cells acquire IGF-I staining at about the time of earliest antrum formation and retain it through folliculogenesis. In large antral follicles IGF-I staining is intense in both theca and granulosa cells. Bovine corpus luteum (CL) also contains IGF immunoreactivity. Staining is diffuse in the early CL, but in the mature gland is limited almost exclusively to the large luteal cells. In the bovine uterus the surface and glandular epithelium of the late proliferative phase endometrium are strongly positive for IGF-I, while the stroma, including the blood vessels, has no reactivity.The inner portion of the myometrium is lightly stained, the outer muscle layer is not.Staining of all these structures is specific, as substitution of normal serum, or preabsorption of the antiserum with IGF-I, abolishes it. These data underscore the importance of IGF-I as a regulator of ovarian function and suggest that its actions, as well as its production, may not be limited to the granulosa cells. Localization of IGF-I within the endometrial epithelium and the inner myometrium is a unique finding, supporting a broad role for IGF-I in reproduction. Supported by an MRC grant to JHD. BCD is a CH.

In the past, our laboratory has focussed on luteal regulation on the non-mammalian reproductive tract and the evolution of viviparity and we have demonstrated luteal progesterone (P) production and P - recep? tors in the reproductive tracts of several reptilian species. Our working hypothesis is that ovarian P acting via oviducal rec? eptors acts to slow egg passage and incr? ease egg retention. In this study we have used an in vivo recording technique in which an intra-uterine balloon responds to pressure changes to study hormonal effects on the myometrium. We show that P inhibi? tion of AVT induced egg laying in Chrys- emys is correlated with a characteristic change in the AVT induced pattern of myo? metrial activity associated with oviposi- tion. In addition, we demonstrate that relaxin (RLX) significantly decreases the interval between myometrial contractions, thus reducing the frequency. These resultc support Hisaw's (1959) hypothesis that the primary function of the non-mammalian cor? pus luteum is to regulate the duration of egg retention. As we have suggested in the past, this is likely to be of great signi? ficance in the evolution of viviparity from oviparity.

B.A.Williams, K.T.Mills, C.D.Burroughs and H.A.Bern. Univ. of California, Berkeley. In view of the established sensitivity of the neonatal mouse reproductive tract to estrogens, we examined the longterm effects of neonatal zearalenone exposure (Z, a weakly estrogenic mycotoxin present in cereal grains). Newborn female mice were injected daily for 5d with either 1 ug Z in 0.02 ml. oil (Z-treated), or vehicle alone. At 8 months, corpora lutea were absent in 25 of 34 (74%) Z- treated mice, indicating ovarian dysfunction. 56% of Z-treated mice had dense collagen deposition in the uterine stroma and lacked uterine stromal glands. Squamous metaplasia of the uterine luminal epithelium was found in 59% of Z-treated mice, and altered vaginal epithelium was found in 32% (2 mice had dysplastic lesions). Ovariectomized (Ovx) Z-treated mice were indistinguishable from Ovx controls at 8 months. Thus, neonatal exposure to this weak dietary estrogen resulted in ovary-dependent reproductive tract alterations at the dose employed.

Previous work showed that the mammary epithelium of mice neonatally exposed to estrogen was more sensitive to prolactin (PRL) in organ culture than the epithelium from untreated mice (Warner et al., Endocrinology 106, 823-832, 1980). To determine if this difference in mam? mary response rested in the mammary epithelial cells (MEC), we cultured collagenase-isolated MEC from neonatally diethylstilbestrol (DES)- exposed or control mice in collagen gel with serum-free medium containing insulin (I), epidermal growth factor and linoleic acid (Lin). This produces PRL-sensitive cells with low levels of casein protein, as measured in cellular homogenates with a specific ELISA. When these cells were subsequently cultured with I, Lin and PRL at concentrations from 1 to 1000 ng/ml, the cells from DES-exposed mice consistently ac? cumulated 75-100% of the casein content of normal controls, but never more, indicating that the isolated MEC of estrogen-exposed mice are not more sensitive to PRL than cells from normal animals, and indeed may be less sensitive.

R.B. White and L Thomas. The University of Texas Marine Science Institute, Port Aransas. The primary objective of this study was to determine if sexual differentiation in Trachemys scripta is accompanied by sex- specific patterns of gonadal steroidogenesis. Eggs were incubated at a male-determining temperature (26 ?C) and a female-determining (31 C) temperature and sacrificed throughout development. Plasma was collected at Yntema stages 17 through 20 by heart puncture, and at stages 21 through 24 from arterial vessels. Embryos were found to contain measurable circulating levels of testosterone (T), 17/3- estradiol (E2), progesterone, dihydro- testosterone, and androstenedione as measured by radioimmunoassay. Preliminary results from stages 21, 23, and 24 indicate that T and E2 Tevels are not strikingly different in embryos incubated at male-determining and female-determining temperatures. In vitro gonadal incubations under a variety of conditions also revealed no marked sex differences, with only weak precursor conversion.

University of New Hampshire, Durham, New Hampshire. Multiple forms of GnRH have been observed within the brains of various species from the bird, reptile, amphibian and fish classes. This investigation examines the possibility of GnRH variants in the brains of three species of fish from elasmobranch and teleost groups, Immunoreactive GnRH was extracted from the brains of skate, ocean pout and Atlantic salmon using acetic acid and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Eluted brains from HPLC were determined for immunoreactive GnRH (irGnRH) by radioimmunoassay (RIA) with specific mammalian and lamprey GnRH antibodies. The brains from skate contained irGnRH chromatographically and immunologically similar to mammalian GnRH, lamprey GnRH, and chicken II GnRH. The brains from ocean pout had mammalian-like irGnRH and the salmon brains had salmon GnRH, chicken II-like GnRH immunoreactivity and two unidentified GnRH-like forms. These data confirm previous studies indicating variant forms of GnRH in vertebrates.

Lin and R. A. Wallace. Univ. of Florida, Whitney Lab., St. Augustine. Ovarian follicles (1.3-1.4 mm) were manually dissected into various somatic cell layers and cultured in vitro to examine which follicular components are involved in steroid synthesis upon Fundulus pituitary extract stimulation. Media and follicular tissue extracts were assayed for 17a-OH,20/J-dihydropro- gesterone (DHP), testosterone (T) and 17/5-estradiol (E2) content using speci? fic radioimmunoassays. Denuded oocytes did not produce any of these three steroids. The follicle cells secreted and retained DHP, T and E2, whereas theca/epithelium layers secreted only T. It thus appears that the 2 cell-type (follicle cell-theca) model for the production of DHP and E2 as described for other species may not be valid for !_? heteroclitus. Tn addition, folli? cular preparations that did not contain the oocyte produced more T and E2, but not DHP, than did intact follicles. This suggests that the oocyte could modify the secretion of T and E2 by sequestering or metabolizing these steroids. 772 EXTRAOCULAR CONTROL OF PHOTOINDUCED TES? TICULAR GROWTH AND REFRACTORINESS IN AMER? ICAN TREE SPARROWS. F. E. Wilson. Kansas State University, Manhattan. To explore whether the eyes function in the mechanisms of photoinduced testicular growth and refractoriness, photosensitive tree sparrows, previously blinded by bilat- eral ocular enucleation, were implanted supracranially either with 3 tritium-filled self-powered lights (SPLs) that individu- ally measured 6.4 x 3.2 x 0.8 mm and con? tinuously emitted green light (spectral peak, 525 ? 5 nm; maximum brightness, 400 /ilambert) or with 3 helium-filled blanks (HBs) that emitted no light. Birds were retained on a short daylength (8L:16D) and laparotomized at intervals of 3-4 wk over the next 76 days. Testicular growth occurred in SPL-implanted, but not HB- implanted, birds. Moreover, as indicated by a 3-fold reduetion in length between days 48 and 76, the testes of SPL-implanted birds regressed spontaneous ly. Subsequent exposure to 20L:4D (&gt; 400 lux), coupled with removal of HBs and SPLs, elicited tes? ticular growth in previously HB-implanted birds, but not in 3 of 4 previously SPL- implanted birds. These data suggest that extraocular mechanisms mediate photoin? duced testicular growth and refractori? ness in American tree sparrows.

George Washington Univ., Washington, D.C, and Colorado State Univ., Fort Collins, CO. This study describes the ultrastruct? ure of an isolated case of gonadal dys- genesis in a genetic female platyfish. The interior of this ovary was thrown in? to many finger-like folds. The most striking characteristic was the enormous number of oogonia, many of which were un? dergo ing mitosis, degeneration, or female-type meiosis. Ultrastructurally these oogonia had all the characteris? tics of normal oogonia; large nucleus with prominent nucleolus; rounded mito? chondria with sparse, oblique cristae; electron-dense granular material (nuage); and annulate lamellae. Yolky atretic fol? licles were present, indicating that some degree of maturation had occurred pre? viously. Several blind, duct-like struc? tures were seen which are not found in normal ovaries. The cells lining these structures were similar to those lining testicular ducts. The syndrome described here resembles certain cases of human gonadal dysgenesis and particularly the neoplasm, gonadoblastoma, and may have a similar etiology. 774 RAPID AGGRESSIVE RESPONSE TO A TERRITORIAL CHALLENGE DURING THE NONBREEDING SEASON. M.R. Brown* and M.C.Moore. Arizona State Univ., Tempe. Aggressive behaviors of breeding male mountain spiny lizards (Sceloporus jarrovi) increase four-fold immediately following an aggressive encounter. This increase persists for at least 90 minutes following the encounter. This rapid, persistent change in behavior is not mediated by changes in testosterone or corticosterone. However, in other species, hormone levels change after aggressive challenges only at times in the reproductive cycle when hormone levels are below maximum. Therefore, we monitored changes in behavior and circulating steroid hormones in challenged male mountain spiny lizards during nonbreeding territoriality, when hormone levels are much lower than during the breeding season. Following staged territorial encounters, free-living resident males increase display frequencies and territorial patrolling four-fold, but this increase only persists for 15 minutes after the encounter. Differences in aggressive response of males in different seasons may be due to seasonal changes in hormone levels, photoperiod, temperature, rainfall, food abundance or presence of sexually receptive females. 775 EFFECT OF LOW PH AND ALUMINUM ON THE URO- PHYSIS IN THE BROOK TROUT.A.Hontela* Y. Roy*,K.Lederis and G.Chevalier, Univ.Que? bec a Montreal,and Univ.of Calgary,Canada Brook trout,S.fontinalis, were subjec? ted to soft water at pH 6.5,5.5 or 5.0 without Al, or to pH 5.5 with 200,300 or 500 ug Al/L added. Radioimmunoassayable urophysial urotensin (Ul and UII) levels and morphometry of the caudal neurosecre? tory cells were determined after one week of treatment. A significant negative cor? relation was found between Ul concentra? tions and pH, and between UII concentra? tions and total Al in the external me? dium. Morphometric indices (cell size and proportion of lobed nuclei in the caudal neurosecretory cells) suggested increased synthetic activity at the lower pH. The data suggest that the caudal neurosecre? tory system in the brook trout may have a role in the physiological adjustements to acidity and aluminum contamination, two major osmoregulatory stressors faced by fish in acidified waters.

The thyroid and skin-shedding relation? ship was studied in intact male cobra, Naja naja and rat snake, Ptyas korros treated with tri-iodothyronine (T_) and/ or thyroxine (T.) and thyroidectomized (Tx) N.naj a kept at 21 C by observing shedding frequency (SF) and analyzing tissue composition and glycogen phosphor- ylase a_ activity. Tx Naja showed an increased SF while injections of T. or T, inhibited shedding in both Naja and Ptyas? In both species, liver weight was un- affected by thyroid hormone injection and Tx, but decreases in liver glycogen followed hormone injection and there was an increase in Naja following Tx. These changes in liver glycogen were accompani? ed by a decrease in the enzyme with T~ injection. T increased % lipid in the liver in Ptyas but not in Naja, decreased muscle glycogen in Ptyas but Tx increased it in Naja. The present study failed to identify changes in metabolite/intermedi- ary metabolism which might be related to skin-shedding in the snake. Surprisingly, data showed that thyroid hormone produced an effect on carbohydrate metabolism at the "low" temperature used for the snake.</page><page sequence="148">148A American Society of Zoologists 777 TIMING OF THYROID CONTROL OF SMOLTIFI? CATION IN FRESHWATER POPULATIONS OF CHINOOK SALMON. A.J. Fivizzani. T.P. McCreery* and T. Hoffnagle*. University of North Dakota. Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawy- tscha) raised in North and South Dakota hatcheries with a constant, deeplake water source undergo elevations of thyroxine levels at smoltification in the spring with highest levels observed at the time of the new moon. The thyroxine peak is amplified two to seven-fold by exposure to a new water source via transfer to a new hatchery or to a cage for culturing in the main reservoir. At smoltification, a daily rhythm of plasma thyroxine was observed with highest levels (4.5-5.5 ng/ml) observed in the morning hours (0800 to 1200) and lowest levels (1.9-2.4 ng/ml) observed in the afternoon and evening. Daily exposure to exogenous thyroxine in the morning (one hour after dawn) resulted in a higher percent? age of fish preferring seawater over fresh within three weeks compared with other treatment times of day or untreated controls. Thus thyroxine effectiveness in stimulating sea water preference is maximum in the morning hours when thyroxine levels are normally high. 778 CHARACTERIZATTCN OF THYJOID BGTOOJE UPIAKE AND T. 1URNCWER IN THE ISOLAIH) MASU SALNTJN, 4 _ Cncorhynchus masou, LIVER CELLS. H^ Yamada, R^ Horiuchi* and K^ Yamauchi. Faculty of Fisheries, Hokkaido Univ., Hakedate, Hokkaiob, Japan. Institute of Erriccrinology, Gunma Univ., Maebashi, Gurma, Japan. It is no doubt that thyroid hormones is important to the process of masu salmon smoltification, but the details of thyroid hormone action on masu salmon is not clear. We examined the characteristics of T uptake into the isolated liver cells, one of the important target cells. The liver cells were isolated by the perfusion with 0.1% collagenase. The uptake of thyroid hormones to the cells was stereospecific to L-T (L-T &gt; L-T &gt; D-T ). Crdy one tenth of L-T uptaken into the cell was distributed to the nucleus. However, little amount of L-T was distributed to the nucleus at 0 and 4C. The nucleus shown to have a single class of T binding_?ite with the dissociation constant of 5.53 x 10 M. The binding affinity was also stereospecific to L-T , and the affinity to L-T and D-T was 1/10 and 1/220 of L-T , respectively. L-T concentrations converted frcm L-T in the incubated liver cells increased and reached maximm after 3hr incubation. These results strongly suggest that L-T in blood is converted to L-T in liver cells, and L-T mic^it be the biolcgically active form of thyroid hormone of masu salmon.

Univ. of California, Berkeley, CA 94720 Based on observations of unchanged plasma T3 and T3 kinetics after T4- loading, Fok and Eales (1984, Gen. Comp. Endo. 53:197) deduced that T4 treatment causes inhibition of 5'-monodeiodinase activity in rainbow trout. To localize and elucidate further this peripheral mechanism, we have studied the effects of thyroid stimulation on plasma and tissue thyroid hormone content in tilapia. Bovine TSH induced dose-dependent increases in T4 in the plasma, brain, and liver. Plasma T3 did not change, but brain and liver T3 levels were reduced in the TSH-injected fish. Highest concentrations of T4 in plasma, brain and liver were seen 24 hours after a single injection of 0.25 IU bTSH. Tissue T3 declined within 4 hours, and, with the exception of the 16-hour sample, remained depressed for the duration of the four-day study. Our results suggest inhibition of 5'-monodeiodinase activity, possibly by T4, under conditions of thyroid stimulation.

Univ. of Rhode Island, Kingston. Whole body thyroxine (T^) and triiodothyronine (T3) levels were measured in 30 days post-hatching striped bass, Morone saxatilis, reared for 10 days at two temperatures (15? and 19?C) and three levels of salinity (0, 11 and 28 ppt). Fish in 1/3 seawater (1/3 SW * llppt) had T4 and T3 levels elevated over fresh water (FW) at both temperatures. T4 levels in fish in SW (28ppt) were greater than those in FW at 19? and less than those in FW at 15?. Temperature alone had no consistent effect on T4 or T3 levels. Eighty days post-hatching striped bass abruptly transferred from FW to 1/3 SW had significantly elevated plasma T4 levels 24 hr after transfer while those transferred to SW demonstrated an upward trend in T4 levels at 24 hr. Plasma T4 levels in fish in both 1/3 SW and SW then declined to below FW control values by 72 hr. These data support the hypothesis that an isotonic environment stimulates growth by increasing thyroid activity.

D.S. MacKenzie. S.P. Havnes. and J.W. McKee*. Texas A&amp;M University, College Station. Channel catfish (Ictalurus ounctatus) in pond culture show a pronounced seasonal cycle in total plasma levels of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Both hormones are lowest during the winter and spring, coincident with maximal gonadal growth and lowest water temperatures, and highest in summer, the period of maximal temperatures and somatic growth. In contrast, the percentage of circulating hormone in the free form remains relatively constant throughout the year, with T3 showing greater binding to plasma proteins. Electrophoretic analysis of thyroid hormone binding to plasma proteins indicates that both hormones bind primarily to an albumin-like protein in plasma, with minor binding to lipoproteins and vitellogenin when present. These results indicate that in this species, thyroid hormone availability to the tissues fluctuates with total hormone levels and that plasma protein binding remains relatively constant in the face of seasonal changes in blood protein composition. The increased free hormone levels in the summer may contribute to maximal somatic growth observed at this time. 782 EFFECTS OF HYPOPHYSECTOMY ON INTERRENAL FUNCTION IN COHO SALMON. Graham Young and Richard S. Nishioka. University of California, Berkeley, CA. Thyroid hormones and growth hormone (GH) influence interrenal function in intact coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). In this study, yearling coho were hypophysectomized (Hx), and after 10 weeks in isotonic seawater, they were injected with either 1 ug/g body weight triiodothyronine (T3) or 5 yg/g body weight ovine GH every other day for a total of 3 injections. Sham-Hx and Hx animals were injected with vehicle. Interrenal tissue was incubated in the presence of ACTH or pregnenolone for 3 h. Cortisol was measured in incubation media. Hypophysectomy decreased tissue sensitivity to ACTH but did not affect maximal steroidogenic capacity; GH or T3 were without effect. However, interrenal tissue from Hx coho displayed a greater ability than tissue from sham Hx to produce cortisol from pregnenolone, and both GH and T3 caused a further increase in this ability. Although the maintenance of tissue sensitivity to ACTH is pituitary-dependent, the maintenance of steroidogenic competency appears to be in part through extra-pituitary factors.

Bacterial aggregates have been found in the sea anemone, Aiptasia pallida. Algal symbionts, common in certain sea anemones, including Aiptasia, are located in the gastrodermis, while the bacteria were found exclusively in the epidermis. They were gram-negative non-motile rods packed closely together in a sac called a bacteriocyte. The size of each bacteriocyte was proportional to the number of bacteria inside it. Ultrastructural features of the bacteria included numbers of vacuoles often intertwined with web-like nucleosomes in the central region. There were an average of 2.7 vacuoles, averaging 162 nm in diameter per bacterial cross section. Preliminary analysis suggested that the bacteria accumulate polyhydroxybutyrate. Observations of the anemone-bacteriocyte membrane interface suggested an anemone origin of the bacteriocyte boundary. Isolated bacteriocytes maintained their structural organization after extrusion from anemone epidermis and showed a whorled arrangement of bacteria. A fatty acid profile suggested that the bacteria may belong to the genus Vibrio. 784 FINE STRUCTURE OF THE MIDGUT CELLS OF THE HETEROTARDIGRADE ECHINISCUS VIRIDISSIMUS. R.A. Dewel, B.G. Roush and W.C. Dewel. Appalachian State Univ., Boone, N.C. Midgut cells surround a lumen filled with protoplasm from ingested moss cells. The apical surface has single or multi- lobed, bulbous projections or folds with? out organized filament bundles. Micro? villi are absent. Numerous, large (up to 6 um) dense bodies are enclosed within membranes coated with parallel strands of glycocalyx-like material. Sheets of RER with slightly swollen cisternae and SER with closed cisternae conform to the sur? face of the enclosing membranes. Similar ER profiles lie adjacent to the plasma- lemma of these cells as well as those of the epidermis. Branches of cortical ER frequently extend into the apical pro? jections which also contain unidentified dense particles. Cells are joined by deep continuous septate junctions. Echiniscus has no Malpighian tubules and the midgut shows little evidence of basal or lateral folding characteristic of transporting epithelia. It is unknown if the dense bodies are eliminated by deposi- tion in the cuticle, excreted via the hindgut or accumulated over the lifetime of the organism.</page><page sequence="150">150A American Society of Zoologists 785 WATER CANALS LEADING FROM OSTIA TO WATER CHANNEL IN ANODONTA GRANDIS GILL ARE EQUIPPED WITH SPHINCTER-LIKE MUSCULATURE. M- Silverman, D.B. Gardiner, and T.H. Dietz, Louisiana State Univ., Baton Rouge. Ostia open at the base of the gill filaments In unionid gills. Water is directed through these ostia into water canals leading to the central water channel. The force for movement of water into the central chamber Is thought to be the ciliary cells. This water flow is important both for respiration, ion transport, etc. The type of epithelial cell present in the water canal varies along the length of the canal. Cell types range from columnar mitochondria rich cells to squamous indifferent cells. Regulation of water flow along these canals the water channel would allow the animal to adjust ion transport gradients. Muscular control may be exerted by a circular muscle band which occurs just above the opening of the water canal into the water channel. These "sphincters" have the potential for flow regulation; either as a muscular pump or as a shutter closing off the opening of the water channel. The later is observed In the formation of the isolated brood chamber in of females during reproduction.

Serial sections of the arms and disc of the asteroid Linckia laevigata were made to determine the route by which nutrients reach the active muscles of a sea-star. It has long been speculated that perihaemal sinuses transport nutrients to many tissues of asteroids. In this study it was determined that the perihaemal sinuses of L. laevigata do not branch as extensively as those of other sea-stars; and therefore, the possibility of an alternate pathway was explored. Serial sections of decalcified, paraffin-embedded L. laevigata arms, 12 to 16 microns in thickness revealed a previously undocumented system of perivisceral coelomic outpockets that penetrate the lateral transverse ambulacral muscles. Further characterization of these outpockets was achieved by enlarging, digitizing, and viewing the sections with three-dimensional reconstruction software on a high resolution color micro-computer system. The shape, orientation and structure of the outpockets suggest that these outpockets provide the conduit by which nutrients are supplied to these muscles. 787 PHYLOGENESIS OF THE PHYLUM NBVERTINA. J.L. Norenburg. National Museum of Natural History, Washington, D.C. Nemertina and Plathelnu^thcniorpha share only plesiomorphies; an anus is the only known synapomorphy with Eubilateria, making outgroup comparison difficult. Classification of nemertines has altered little since 1895, with many taxa defined by synplesiomorphies, e.g. the order Palaecnemertina comprises about 6 poly- or paraphyletic groups. Phylogenetic analysis leads me to recognize a plesio- morph nemertinean *ground-plan" including: vascular system a simple loop, one pair nephridia, nervous system epidermal, pro- boscis with two nerves and pseudccnids, a "planuloid" larva, inner circular muscle, (regionated proboscis?), no cerebral or lateral sense organs. Cerebral organs are a synapomorphy of Tubulanidae, hubrecht- ids, Hetero- and Hbplonemertina. Synapo- norphies of the last three taxa include absence of lateral sense organs and pres? ence of a middorsal blood vessel (and its vascular plug?). The pilidium larva uni- fies Heteronemertina and Hubrechtella. Intramuscular location of the nervous system in Cephalothricidae (and C^rinomi- dae?) is an autapomorphy and independent of the submuscular, autapcmorphic posi? tion in Hoplonemertina. These conclusions are corroborated by additional features. 788 SIPUNCULAN ASSOCIATES OF THE DEEP-SEA HYDROCARBON SEEP COMMUNITY. M. E. Rice. Smithsonian Marine Station at Link Port, Fort Pierce, FL. Marine worms of the phylum Sipuncula are reported for the first time in the hydrocarbon seep community in the north? ern Gulf of Mexico. Previously this com? munity has been noted to consist of mus? sels, clams, and tube worms (vestimentif- erans and pogonophorans). Specimens were collected by the R/V Gyre on the Louisi? ana slope by trawling at depths of 400 to 500 meters. Of the 3 species found, only 1 was common. It occupies pogono- phoran tubes no longer inhabited by the original occupant. An undescribed species, it is assigned to the family Golfingiidae. It is a deposit feeder, as indicated by the sediment-packed elongate spiral gut. Tentacles are reduced to inconspicuous lobes. Coel? omic oocytes are low in yolk density, suggesting a planktotrophic development.</page><page sequence="151">Abstracts 151A 789 THE NORTHERN PACIFIC AS A CENTER OF DIVERSITY FOR COLD-WATER HIPPOLYTID SHRIMP. M. K. Wicksten. Texas A&amp;M Univ., College Station. Of the 6 genera of hippolytid shrimp in the northeastern Pacific, only 2 range into shallow tropical regions. Three others (Lebbeus, Eualus and Spirontocaris) are most diverse in the northern Pacific; Heptacarpus is endemic to the area. Patterns of distribution of these 4 genera coincide with those of Cancer crabs, kelp (Laminariales), sculpins (family Cottidae) and other cold-water groups. These distributions suggest that these 4 genera originated in the northern Pacific, and that species of 3 of them dispersed in the Cenozoic primarily into the northern Atlantic and to a lesser extent into the Indo-Pacific and southern hemisphere. 790 REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY OF THE ANTARCTIC BROODING SEA URCHINS ABATUS SHACKLETONI AND ABATUS NIMRODI. J. B. McClintock and J. S. Pearse. Univ. of Alabama, Birmingham and Univ. of California, Santa Cruz. Abatus shackletoni and A. nimrodi collected in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica throughout the austral summer and fall had dorsal ambulacral brood pouches containing embryos and juveniles at various stages of development. No significant intra- or inter-specific differences in the numbers and developmental stages of embryos and juveniles within each of the four brood pouches were found. Fecundity (number individuals in brood pouches) increased with increasing body size and reached a maximum of 102 in A. shackletoni (test length = 46mm) and 129 in A. nimrodi (test length = 87mm). Histological sections of the gonads of both species revealed ripe testes and ovaries containing previtellogenic, vitellogenic and mature oocytes during the austral summer and fall. Mature oocytes measured 1.2 and 2.1 mm diameter in A. shackletoni and A. nimrodi. respectively. Repro? ductive indexes (g wet gonad/g wet intact animal) were similar between males and females within each species and 3 to 4 times higher in A. nimrodi than A.. shackletoni. The relative allocation of energy (kJ) to the primary body com? ponents (body wall:gut:gonads) in mature A. shackletoni and &amp;. nimrodi was 3.4: 2.5:1.3 and 36.5:8.8:29.0, respectively.

Correlations between population levels of invertebrates found in association with colonial reef animals and physical factors are under study. Airlift-type vacuum samplers are used to detect small-scale abundance differences in a manner similar to those of terrestrial and aquatic studies. On the hydrozoan, Eudendrium eximium, tube-dwelling and prehensile taxa were positively correlated with hydrozoan volume, while few correlations were detected in the association of these taxa with the colonial tubicolous polychaete, Phyllochaetopterus socialis. Present work is aimed at detecting the effects of several physical factors (i.e. currents, light and mucus) on the small-scale distributions of invertebrates associated with the coral, Montastrea annularis. If correlations between population levels and physical factors are detected, experimental manipulations will be used to test for cause and effect. 792 SUCCESSFUL OCCUPATION OF THE SAME ENVIRONMENTALLY VARIABLE HABITAT DOES NOT REQUIRE SIMILAR PHYSIOLOGICAL ADAPTATION. J.D. Ferraris, K. Fauchald, B.F. Kensley. NIH, Bethesda, MD, and Nat. Mus. Nat. Hist., Washington, DC. Members of a mangrove mudf lat com? munity were examined for regulation of water and ion content (g HjO or umoles- g"1 solute free dry wt). Species were subjected to acute, cyclic exposure to either decreased (25 ?/oo) or increased (45 ?/co) salinity (control = 35 ?/oo). Regardless of the direction of the salinity change, Golfingia cylindrata (Sipuncula) behaved as an osmoconformer and did not demonstrate ability to regulate water content. Terebellides anguicomus (Polychaeta) behaved as an csmcconformer, showed incomplete regula? tion of water content via change in Na, K, and Cl contents, but did not survive return to control salinity after exposure to increased salinity. Alpheus viridari (Decapoda) behaved as an hyperosmotic conformer at decreased salinity but an osmcconformer at increased salinity. Regardless of direction of salinity change, /L viridari regulated water content through change in Na, K, and Cl contents.

Laboratory observations of echinoid larvae, mainly S. purpuratus, have revealed complex patterns of swimming behavior, varying by developmental stage. Before, and shortly after, hatching, the blastula rotates randomly, but within 30 min of hatching begins to swim directionally, animal pole leading, rotating around the animal-vegetal axis. This pattern continues through mesenchyms blastula and gastrula stages. At early prism stage there is a brief period of slow, eccentric swimming as the axis of rotation switches from animal-vegetal to anterior (oral)-posterior. Well- coordinated swimming, generally in the oral direction, persists until the unfed pluteus approaches death and begins tumbling end-over-end. The latter behavior is invariable and terminal. While free-swimming, the larva will alternate between right- and left-hand twist. However, the larva is positively thigmotactic, and is often found clinging to the surface of the water or glass; in this position it rotates always with a left-hand twist. The direction of swimming is determined by positive thigmotaxis, positive phototaxis (at moderate light intensity), and negative geotaxis, but aerotaxis was not observed. 794 MORPHOLOGICAL VARIATION IN SHALLOW-WATER 0CT0P0DS: A REASSESSMENT. J, R0 Voighta University of Arizona, Tucson? Octopods are soft-bodied, lacking any but the most rudimentary shell remnants and a small section of hyaline cartilage over the brain. Formalin fixation deforms specimens, and can cause shrinkage after as many as 70 years in preservation. These physical characteristics, coupled with the lack of well-defined anatomical points on which to base a system of measurements, has resulted in only limited use of external morphology in taxonomy0 To determine the extent of morphological variation, six measurements from 10 species of west Atlantic octopods were log-transformed and compared to log mantle length, a proxy for body size. Consistent with the hypothesis of minimal intra? specific variation, 56 of the 60 correlations were significant (p o05), with 43 highly significant (p o001), Despite the soft body and the lack of well defined landmarks, octopod specimens do not exhibit significant variation in shape independent of sizee External morphology may provide a reliable basis for taxonomy and future systematic studies. 824 SOCIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE SAND TILEFISH, MALACANTHUS PLUMIERI: RESOURCE OR FEMALE DEFENSE? T.A. Baird and N.R. Liley*. Univ. of British Columbia. Vancouver, B.C. The sand tilefish occurs in colonies composed of polygynous mating units aptly characterized as harems. Field experiments were conducted to examine whether males monopolize females through defense of resources, control of mates, or both. Females defend home burrows and feeding areas, whereas males position territories to encompass mates. Removal tests revealed that intrasexual competition rather than a male restricts the location of females. Competition is not so intense, however, as to prevent group formation, and groups appear to promote reliable spawning opportunities and predator avoid? ance in site-restricted females. We suggest that a dichotomy bet? ween resource and mate defense may not apply when harem formation is feasible because sedentary females aggregate to reduce predation risk, but females also defend food necessary for daily egg production. 825 FEMALE PREFERENCE FOR BODY SIZE, SWORD LENGTH AND SWORD COLOR IN THE SWORDTAIL, XIPHOPHORUS HELLERI. A. L. Basolo. University of Texas at Austin. Darwin (1871) first suggested that the caudal appendage possessed by males of the swordtail fish, Xiphophorus helleri, evolved as a consequence of sexual selection by female choice. Although the swordtail provides a spectacular example of a sexually dimorphic epigamic character, its importance in female mate choice has not been established. At least one previous study has failed to detect female preferences for male swords. I examined female mating preferenoes for three male traits: body size, sword length and sword color. Females preferred larger males in paired choice tests. Females also preferred males with longer swords over males with shorter swords. In the field, males are polymorphic for sword color. Females were found to prefer males with orange swords over males with yellow-green swords. These results support Darwin's proposal that the swordtail evolved as a consequence of female mate choice. Therefore, body size, sword length and sword color are potentially subject to sexual selection.</page><page sequence="153">Abstracts 153A 826 FEMALE MATING PREFERENCES FOR ALREADY MATED MALES AND THE EVOLUTION OF MALE PARENTAL CARE IN FISHES. C.W. Petersen, Univ. of Toronto. In many vertebrates, parental care of a female*s offspring typically reduces a malefs ability to attract additional females. This mating cost of paternal care reduces the evolutionary stability of male care. In fishes, paternal care is more common than maternal care. In experimental field tests with four species of blennies and damselfishest the presence of eggs or mating females either had no effect on or increased the future mating success of the paternal male. Egg survivorship was positively correlated with clutch size. One factor contributing to this pattern was a higher rate of cannibalism of small clutches by paternal males. The ability of paternal males to continue attracting females has probably played a critical role in the evolution of paternal care in fishes. 827 COURTSHIP AND AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR IN MALE LIZARDS EXHIBITING TWO DIFFERENT SEXUAL COLORATIONS. M.S. Rand. Univ. of Colorado, Boulder. Throughout a large portion of their range, adult male Sceloporus undulatus erythrocheilus exhibit either orange or yellow facial coloration (a secondary sexual character). A field study was initiated in an attempt to establish an understanding of the biological function of these two colors in adult males. Extensive behavioral observations of a population of over 60 marked individuals were made during the breeding season. All adult males (n=15) were observed courting an adult female (n=20) at least once. Males exhibit extensive home-range overlap (up to 90%) during the breeding season. Aggressive interactions were observed for all adult males. Interactions between orange and yellow males always resulted in orange male victories. Dominance hierarchies existed among orange males as well. Regardless of color, all male home-ranges included at least one female home-range. The amount of time spent with females differed significantly between orange and yellow males during the breeding season. Dominant orange males spent significantly more time courting females than did yellow males. These data are a preliminary indication that assortative mating may be important in this system and that it may be related to differences in facial coloration.

Univ. of Minnesota, Minneapolis. Lepidopteran males produce spermatophores during mating that often represent a significant investment. Female monarch butterflies (Danus plex ippus) were dissected after mating to determine the size of this investment. Spermatophore mass varied from 1 to 10% of male body mass, and was affected by male age, size, and mating history. Females were mated to two groups of males, one that donated small spermatophores and one that donated large spermatophores, and exposed to males daily until they remated. Females that received large spermatophores waited longer to remate. The material in spermatophores benefits males by delaying female remating, increasing male fitness. 829 BODY AND TESTIS SIZE AMONG TERRITORIAL AND NON-TERRITORIAL NORTHERN FUR SEALS, (CALLORHINUS URSINUS). W.E. Roberts. Univ. of California, Berkeley. Body size, testis size, and age were compared among territorial and non- territorial northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus) males to determine whether non-territorial individuals were younger or smaller than territorial ones. Most non-territorial males were younger, but among males of the same age, territorial animals were longer and had larger testes. The "marginal male effect" appears to have contributed to the evolution of extreme polygyny in this species. Testis weights of territorial males during the height of the mating season were approximately three times the size predicted for this species, based on comparison with other mammals. Sperm competition did not account for the relatively large testes. Extreme polygyny combined with a relatively short mating season (less than one month) contributed to a high copulatory rate for males, and may have accounted for the unusual size of the testes.</page><page sequence="154">154A American Society of Zoologists 830 SEXUAL SIZE DIMORPHISM IN AQUATIC ARTHROPODS: SOME COMPONENTS OF VARIANCE. R. E. Loveland* and M^ L. Botton, Rutgers Univ., New Brunswick, NJ and Fordham Univ., New York, NY. Certain behavioral aspects of mating appear to be related to the average size of males, relative to females, in sexually mature individuals of aquatic arthropods. Components of variance of the mated females, when compared to the size of the male, are important in predicting the strength of such behavioral traits as precopulatory guarding, amplexus and territoriality. The limits of divergence in size between males and females are related to female reproductive investment. 831 COURTSHIP BEHAVIOR OF THE ROUND STINGRAY UROLOPHUS HALLERI. S.E. NORDELL, UNIV. OF ARIZONA, TUCSON. Courtship behavior of the round sting- ray, TTmlnphus hallp.rl, was observed from 12-19 March 1988 in a protected bay south of Punta La Ona, Sonora, Mexicoc Focal periods were recorded of male and female courtship behavior between 6:30 and 11:00 a.nu, the daily peak of courtship activity. During courtship the rays pre? dominantly used the sandy, shallow area between the deeper eelgrass beds and shore. Male stingrays travel along the shoreline searching for females. They chase and bite females on the posterior region of the pectoral fin. It has been speculated that this biting behavior leads to forced copulation but this has never been observed. While being bitten by males, females often struggled and when the pair separated females either buried in the sand or headed past the eelgrass beds toward deeper water. Males were never observed burying in the sand. Only males were observed biting con? specifics during courtship. Biting may serve as a pre-copulatory release mechan? ism or as a determinant of mate choice by females, and may explain the presence of sexually dimorphic dentition in these organisms. 832 INTERFERENCE IN RHESUS MACAQUE MATING PAIRS. T.E. Ruehlmann. Univ. of Georgia, Athens, GA, and the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center of Emory Univ. Rhesus macaques have been thought to have a mating system based upon male-male competition for females. However, recent data have suggested otherwise. This study examined mating pairs that were disrupted by a third party. Males interfered with mating pairs more than expected, while females were the target of interference. Interferences were not effective, as most pairs resumed proximity and mounting shortly thereafter. There was no significant difference between the percentage of disrupted pairs and nondisrupted pairs that ended in ejaculation. Mount series involving the alpha male were occasionally disrupted while those involving the alpha female were not. This evidence does not support the hypothesis that the rhesus macaque mating system is based upon male-male competition.

As the American lobster passes through its larval stages and into the fourth, or post-larval, stage, dramatic changes occur in its external and internal masticatory structures. These changes correspond to the change in habitat, from planktonic to benthic existence, and have led to the conclusion that an accompanying change in diet occurs at settlement. However, laboratory evidence indicates that post? larvae can remove zooplankton from the water column and can survive on it exclusively for part of their first year. High-speed film and videography studies on Stage VI lobsters suggest that they may capture zooplankton with all or some of their self-generated currents (a gill current, an exopodite current of the maxillipeds, and a pleopod current). The exopodite current reverses the forward- projecting gill current, drawing water toward the animal1s head region. The pleopod current also moves a volume of water toward and beneath the lobster. Upon sensing planktonic organisms, the lobster fans its pleopods to bring the plankton-rich water toward it. Particles that come to the head region are drawn towards the mouthparts by the exopodite current and are captured when the third maxillipeds move downward, shoveling them toward the other five pairs of mouthparts. The particles are probably retained by the numerous setae that flank the mouthparts.</page><page sequence="155">Abstracts 155A 834 CAN BARNACLES COUNT TO TEN? SUSPENSION FEEDING IN VARIABLE FLOW AND THE ROLE OF LEARNING. G.C. Trager. Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole MA 02543. Laser optics (Strickler 1985) were used to make high magnification, high resolution video tapes of barnacle (Semibalanus balanoides) feeding behavior in a special tank capable of producing variable patterns of water flow. Video analysis shows that barnacles exhibit a clear behavioral switch from active to passive suspension feeding over a specific flow velocity range. When exposed to more complex patterns of water motion (e.g. wave action), barnacles quickly reorient feeding structures in response to changes in flow direction. They appear to be able to learn patterns of water motion, and anticipate changes in flow, thus enhancing feeding efficiency in their natural wave-swept environment. Results will be shown in a short video presentation. 835 SOCIAL FACILITATION AND INHIBITION OF FEEDING IN JUVENILE CHUM SALMON ONCORHYNCHUS KETA. CH. Rver and B.L. Olla . Hatfield Mar. Sci. Ctr., Newport, OR. Many benefits of living in a group may be derived through shar- ing information. Experiments exam? ined feeding behavior of isolated fish and the effects of visual ex? posure to nonfeeding, feeding, and alarmed groups of conspecifics. Highest feeding rates were ex? hibited by control (no group expo? sure) and feeding group treat? ments. Intermediate and lowest rates characterized nonfeeding and alarm group treatments, respec? tively. Feeding was facilitated in isolates exposed to feeding con? specifics. Isolates may have in- terpreted lack of feeding as vigilance and decreased their own feeding. Alarmed groups, display- ing heightened vigilance, further decreased isolate feeding. Addi? tional experiments examined the effect of group size (1, 2, or 4 fish) upon the feeding of group members. Single fish took longer to begin feeding than fish in groups, although no differences were observed in feeding rates. 836 COMPARATIVE DEVELOPMENT OF PREY CATCHING BEHAVIOR OF LEOPARD FROGS IN THE RANA PIPIENS COMPLEX. B.P. Biedermann. University of Iowa, Iowa City. The motor patterns involved with prey capture were studied in three species of leopard frogs, Rana blairi. Rana pipiens. and Rana snhenocephala. Interspcific analyses were designed to determine whether behavioral differences observed between recently metamorphosed and adult animals were due to an ontogenetic modification of behavior or if there was evidence for interstage selection against inefficient feeding behaviors. Results suggest that several aspects of these motor patterns do indeed change during the first month following metamorphosis. These changes include latency of behavioral onset, time to completion of a feeding trial, and the efficiency of prey capture as determined by a prey catching index (PCI). Survivorship of laboratory populations was 100% for ?. pipiens and R- blairi. but was reduced to 80% for R. sphenocephala. Patterns in behavioral development reflect the independently established phylogenetic relatedness of the group. 837 EVASIVE MANEUVERS OF TADPOLES AND FROGS IN COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTS. K. vS. Hoff. University of Nevada, Las Vegas. In open arenas strongly directional threats induce tadpoles and frogs to flee in highly specific directions away from the threat. However, in more complex environments the threat direction is far less predictive of the direction of flight. I have examined the evasive maneuvers of frogs and tadpoles to test whether the positions of nearby obstacles consistently bias the direction or speed of their flight. I found that when adult Rana pipiens were presented with a visual threat (a looming dark object) they jumped not only to evade the looming threat, but also such that they avoided nearby obstacles ~ even when those obstacles had been removed up to 60 seconds previously. Similarly, in aggregates of Rana clamitans and Bufo americanus tadpoles, an electric pulse induced tadpoles to flee such that they avoided the positions previously occupied by their nearest neighbors, even though die flight itself sometimes caused a collision. Both tadpoles and frogs tended to flee in directions that took them behind or around, rather than directiy away from, the positions previously occupied by their neighbors or by small obstacles, respectively. Aggregated tadpoles swam faster than single tadpoles. Among aggregated tadpoles, the highest velocities were achieved by tadpoles swimming in the direction of, but not on a collision course with, positions previously occupied by neighbors at a distance of 1 to 2 body lengths away. These studies suggest that 1) tadpoles and frogs assess possible get-away strategies prior to, and not during, evasive maneuvers; and 2) nearby obstacles (possibly representing cover) can influence both the speed and the direction of evasive maneuvers.</page><page sequence="156">156A American Society of Zoologists 838 AVOIDANCE OF PREDATORS BY SALAMANDERS THROUGH THE DETECTION OF CHEMICAL ODORS. P. V. Cupp, Jr. Eastern Kentucky Univ. Richmond. Two species of salamanders, Plethodon richmondi and P^ dorsalis, were tested for the ability to detect odors of the ringneck snake, Diadophis punctatus, a known predator of small salamanders and their eggs. Individual salamanders were placed in rectangular plastic containers (31 x 23 x 10 cm) and provided with two substrate choices. One substrate con? sisted of a paper towel that had been previously exposed to a D^_ punctatus for 48 hrs and then moistened with aged water. The other substrate consisted of a paper towel moistened with aged water. Salamanders were released into the middle of the container and their pos? itions monitored over a period of 2 hrs. All observations were made under red light from 2200-2400 hrs. Both I\_ rich? mond i (N-10) and I\_ dorsalis (N=10) exhibited significant avoidance of D. punctatus substrate suggesting that these salamanders are able to detect this snake's odors. This ability to de? tect odors of possible predators would probably reduce the risks of predation, and may influence a salamander!s selec? tion of home or egg deposition sites. 839 BIOCHEMICAL AND NUTRITIONAL COMPOSITION OF EUCALYPTUS CORRELATED TO THE FEEDING PREFERENCES OF THE KOALA (Phascolarctos cinereus adustus), A. Zoidis and N.E. Gershenz*. San Francisco State Univ., San Francisco, and San Francisco Zoo, San Francisco, CA. Four captive adult koalas at the San Francisco Zoo vere fed nine different species of Eucalyptus over the course of two weeks. Correlation between nutri? tional composition of Eucalyptus and feeding preference was investigated. Browse was welghed prior to feeding and 16 hours later upon removal. Grams con? sumed per species per animal was recorded and a rank order of Eucalyptus preference was established. Biochemical analysis of Eucalyptus browse (dry basis) yielded the following nutritional and chemical con? centrations: protein (amino nitrogen), crude fat, acid detergent fiber, lignin, cellulose, ash, gross energy and essen? tial oil (X cineol). Unitized grams consumed per kilo koala was obtained from data of mean browse consumption per day per koala. A compositional variance existed in all nine species with the exception of percent ash. Indications show that a preference exists for Eucalyptus species with high protein and low fiber content. 840 WINTER FORAGING BEHAVIOR IN BISON (Bison bison) IN YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, WYOMING. G_. B.owser Research Divlslon, National Park Service. The winter foraging behaviors of bison were studied at sfx different locations within Yellow- stone park that varied In snow accumulation and thermal Influence. Behaviors were recorded using focal animal sampling based on random selection from a group of observable animals, with each animal sampled for ten one mlnute Intervals. The results show significant differences In behavioral frequency at the different locations, but not between animals at the same location. Animals In the Interlor of the park with snow de? pths of 90 cm exhibited lower frequencies of behav- ors than those ln the northern end of the park (10cm snow). Foraging efficiency was estimated using the ratio of behaviors to the number of bltes of material removed. There were significant differ? ences In the number of steps, head-swlngs, and paws to the number of bltes between the six differ? ent locations In the park. However, there was no linear functional relationship between the snow depths and the ratio of behaviors. The data suggest potential relatlonships be? tween the occurrence of certain behaviors and geo? graphical locations ln the park, but snow depth was not the primary Influence. Future studies Include the examination of snow type and thermal activity of the Individual components of foraging behaviors. 841 WHAT INFLUENCES MICROHABITAT CHOICE IN LARGE UNGULATES ?: A TEST OF MULTIPLE HYPOTHESES USING AMERICAN BISON. L. Kerley and J. Berqer*. Univ. of Nevada, Reno. Microhabitat choice may be a result of many interrelated factors; i.e., food preference, insect harassment, predation, or thermoregulatory demands. Summer resting site choice by male and female bison was examined to determine the importance of each of the above factor. Multiple hypotheses were addressed using observations on captive and free- ranging animals along with measurements of reflective radiation, biting fly abundance, foraging activity, and antipredator behavior in different microhabitats. Significant intersexual differences in resting site choice were found. Predator detection and insect avoidance had a strong influence on resting site selection and intersexual differences were attributed to a greater vulnerability of females to predation.</page><page sequence="157">Abstracts 157A 842 ARE HERMIT CRABS PLACING ANEMONES ON THE CRAB'S GASTROPOD SHELL RAN- DOMLY, FOR BALANCE, OR FOR MAXIMUM PROTECTION? W.R. Brooke. Florida Atlantic Univ., Boca Raton. It has been suggested that anemones are placed on snail shells by hermit crabs to maximize pro- tection and adjust the shell's center of gravity. In the present study, the hermit crab Pagurue pollicariB, while in a Fascio- laria lillum shell, was given ac? cess to the anemone Calliactis tricolor under three conditions: 1) shell weight unaltered, 2) weight attached to right side of shell, and 3) weight attached to left side. Under condition #1, anemones were placed nonrandomly, with most being placed on top and to the right on the shell. Under condition #2, most were placed on top, but to the left. Under condi? tion #3, placement was similar to that of #1. Apparently, the ane? mones are placed for balance. Also, based on previously published data, the anemones were not commonly placed in areas that would maximize protection.

Oregon State University, Corvallis. Sex differentiation in many teleost species can be controlled by treatment with steroids. To inves- tigate the development of steroidogenesis during both "natural" and "controlled" sex differentiation, the levels of androstenedione, testosterone, and estradiol were determined in tissues from popula? tions of all female and all male rainbow trout. At various times from hatching through gonadal sex differentiation, steroidogenic tissues were incubated in vitro along or in the presence of partly purified salmon gonadotropin (GtH) and the media was assayed for steroids. Androstenedione was produced at higher levels than any other steroid measured, was stimulated by GtH, and was produced primarily by the interrenal (at the earliest stages). Testosterone and estradiol production were sexually "dimorphic" in differentiated gonads. Gonadal proteins were isolated by SDS-PAGE and showed sensitivity to exogenous steroid treatment. 844 Hormonal ly Induced Gonadal Differentia? tion In Reptiles. W.H.N. Gutzke, J.J. Bull, D. Crews and D. Chymiy. Memphis State Univ., Tennessee, and Univ. of Texas, Austin. The application of exogenous estrogen is known to cause ovarian development in representatives of all major groups of reptiles. The timing of hormone injection is critical to the response noted. In general, maxi? mal effects are obtained if the hormone is applied during or shortly prior to the embryonic period in which gonadal differentiation occurs. Hormonally induced gonadal differ? entiation is a potential tool for conservation and management. Previous attempts to use hormones to functionally determine sex in amniotes have failed due to various reasons. The causes and remedies for some of these problems are identified and discussed. 845 ANDROGEN METABOLISM IN BRAIN AND SKIN OF THE SEX-ROLE REVERSED PHALAROPE. B.A. Schlinger, A.J. Fivizzani &amp; G.V. Callard. Boston Univ., Boston, and Univ. of N. Dakota, Grand Forks. In Wilson's phalarope (Phalaropus tri- color), males and females show a reversal of several androgen dependent sex behavi? ors and morphological characters with no reversal of circulating steroid levels. To determine whether the sex-role reversal is due to differences in target organ met? abolism, we measured aromatase activity (AA), 5*- and 5/0-reductase activity (RA) in brain and skin of phalaropes from a natural breeding population. AA in the hypothalamus/preoptic area (HPOA) was greater in males than females whereas there were no sex-differences in 5*- or 5&gt;0-RA in any brain region. Both AA and 5*- RA were greater in anterior HPOA of breed? ing vs non-breeding males. Thus, the beha? vioral sex-role reversal in phalaropes cannot be accounted for by differences in androgen metabolism but the greater AA and 5?&lt;-RA in AHPOA of breeding males may be linked to the expression of masculine cop- ulatory behaviors. AA was not detected in skin containing a sexually dimorphic feather tract but 5*-RA was higher in fe? males (vs males) which may account for their brighter nuptial plumage.

H.B. Austin. Widener Univ., Chester, PA The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of estradiol and testosterone on mullerian-duct re? gression in the alligator. Castrated fe? male hatchlings were either implanted with a testicular graft or were sham- operated. They then were treated with testosterone, estradiol, or a placebo. Eight weeks after surgery, the females were sacrificed and the urogenital system removed for histology. Females that received a testicular graft demon? strated a significant reduction in all parameters of the ducts indicative of regression. Estradiol caused hypertrophy of the ducts in females that were sham- operated and prevented regression in females with testicular grafts. Testo? sterone had no effect on the mullerian ducts. It neither enhanced graft- induced regression nor caused regression itself. Except for the inability of testosterone to enhance testis-induced regression, these results are consistent with those observed in mammals and birds.

M.T. Mendonca and D. Crews. Univ. of Texas at Austin. Within four hours of mating, female garter snakes exhibit a significant rise in circulating estrogen (E) levels. We disrupted sensory input from the cloacal region of females before mating in 3 ways: 1) spinal transection, 2) topical administration of lidocaine, or 3) injection of tetracaine. All three treatments significantly blocked the post-mating estrogen surge. Mated control females exhibited an estrogen surge while mated treated animals did not differ significantly from unmated controls. All treatments also significantly lowered the number of females undergoing vitellogenesis 6-8 weeks after mating. This evidence suggests that stimuli associated with mating initiate a neuroendocrine reflex that has both short-term and long-term effects on female reproduction. 848 CHARACTERISTICS AND ZONAL DISTRIBUTION OF AN ANDROGEN RECEPTOR IN Necturus TESTTS. S. Singh and G.V. Callard. Boston Univ., Boston, MA. Using the testis of a urodele amphibian (Necturus roaculosus) in which a subcap- sular zone (ScZ) ocraposed primarily of Leydig cells can be separated from a germinal zone (GZ) composed primarily of spermatogonia and Sertoli cells, we have identified a~presumptive androgen receptor (AR). When ( H) testosterone (T) is used in a standard binding assay fbllowed by dex- tran-coated charcoal, Sephadex LH-20 or DNA-cellulose chromatography to separate free and bound steroid, this AR displayed high affinity (K,= 1.8 nM), limited capa? city (B= 0.12 nM) and steroid specifi? city (T= 5a-dihydroT &gt; progesterone = cor? ticosterone &gt; estradiol) . It was detect- able only in nuclear extracts where &gt;80% of binding sites were occupied with endo? genous ligand. Testicular AR was dis- tinguishable from a cytosolic, non-recep- tor androgen binding protein (ABP) in the same tissue by its steroid specificity, intracellular location, sedimentation co? efficient and electrophoretic mobility. Although AR was present in ScZ, levels were higher in GZ, suggesting a dual cell? ular location (Leydig and Sertoli cells) and a regulatory role during early sper- matogenic stages.

Denver and Paul LichtT Department of Zoology, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720. Static culture techniques were used to examine the effects of neuropeptides on thyrotropin (TSH), growth hormone (GH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion by turtie pituitaries (Pseudemvs scripta). Pituitaries were exposed to 10"9 to 10"? M thyrotropin releasing-hormone (TRH), corticotropin releasing-hormone (oCRH), sauvagine (SV), carp urotensin I (Ul), rat growth hormone releasing- hormone (rGHRH), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), arginine vasotocin (AVT), salmon gonadotropin releasing hormone (sGnRH) or chicken II GnRH (cGnRH). Medium concentrations of TSH, GH and LH were estimated by RIA. Significant dose responses in TSH secretion were observed with TRH, oCRH, VIP and rGHRH SV and Ul also stimulated TSH at the single dose (10~8 M) tested. These peptides had similar potencies. GH secretion was elevated in a dose-related manner by TRH, oCRH, rGHRH and VIP. Neither AVT nor the two GnRH molecules had any effect on TSH or GH secretion. Only the two GnRHs stimulated significant increases in LH secretion. These results demonstrate that hatchling turtie thyrotropes and somatotropes lack specificity in their responses to hypothalamic peptides, whereas, the gonadotropes appear to be specific for molecules of the GnRH family.

Kallman, Brooklyn College and N.Y. Aquarium, Brooklyn, N.Y. A multiple allelic series in Xiphophorus nigensis controls the growth rate in immature fish and size at sexual maturation. The genetic polymorphism is restricted to the Y chromosome. All females are homozygous for slow growth rate and small size at maturity. Males, depending upon which alleles are present, are either slow and small (S) or fast and large (L). Pituitaries from males of both genotypes and females, 6 weeks of age, were investigated for GH cell activity by histology and by double antibody immunocytochemistry (ICC), usinganti-tilapiaGH (Farmeretal., 197). The ICC slides were subjected to computerized densitometry. Fish q Aver. Optical Dens.1 Integr.

Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor. A lambda-genomic library of _X. laevis (I. Dawid, NIH) was screened by plaque hybridization (61?, 2X SSC) with a cDNA bPRL probe (W. Miller, UCSF). In screening 300,000 recombinants, 6 showed homology with PRL at the moderately strin- gent criterion stated above, These 20 Kb inserts were digested with Eco RI and sub- cloned into an M-13 derived plasmid. Sub- clones contain fragments varying in size from 0.6 to 7.2 Kb. Many Eco RI fragments display after Southern transfer reduced or no hybridization with the probe. A few show greater homology by hybridization at elevated stringency (e.g., 63? and IX SSC). A few fragments also hybridize (at relatively low stringency) with a cDNA probe of bGH. Therefore, certain sub- clones appear to contain coding segments of DNA homologous to bPRL (or to bGH) exons. Others contain predominantly sequences adjacent to the coding segments. The sequencing of selected subclones will reveal the complete nucleotide sequence of an amphibian PRL or PRL-related gene including introns and upstream or down? stream regulatory sites.

State Univ. of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY. The goby posterior intestine can distinguish between the caudal neurosecretory peptide urotensin II (UII) and its structural analog somatostatin (SRIH); UII stimulates* active ion absorption whereas SRIH is without effect. Sandostatin" (Sandoz SMS 201-995) is a SRIH analog containing the active core common to SRIH and UII but lacking the tails which apparently confer recognition in species specificity. Effects on transepithelial ion transport were assessed using "Cl fluxes and cellular electrophysiology. Both Sandostatin* and UII produced decreased radiochloride backflux consistent with the observed increase in transepithelial resistance, increased net chloride absorption, and the cellular depolarization typical of transport stimulation. Speculation on the role of the tails in species-specific recognition is supported by the nature of amino acid residue substitutions in SRIH, UII and SandostatinH and suggests the existence of multiple receptor types for this group of peptides.

Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge. Two species of Portunid crabs, Callinectes sapidus and C. similis. were exposed to a range of salinities for 21 days to determine the response of tolerance and bioenergetics to the salinity gradient. C. sapidus inhabits a wider portion of the salinity gradient than C. similis. Bioassay results show C. similis to be more tolerant of high salinities and less tolerant of low salinities than C. sapidus. C. sapidus exhibits highest scope for growth (P) at 10 and 25?/ooS and lowest at 2.5?/oo. c. similis responds to salinity with a similar pattern and with scope for growths of similar magnitude. There is a significant drop in P with time for both species, especially at lower salinities. Variation in P is due primarily to energy consumed. Metabolic costs are generally much lower than gains and respiration is the primary component of metabolic costs. ?. sapidus' tolerance and bioenergetics reflect its wide distribution in the salinity gradient, but C. similis appears much more physiologically tolerant of salinity than its field distribution suggests.</page><page sequence="160">160A American Society of Zoologists 854 EVIDENCE FOR THE PARTICIPATION OF MONOVALENT ION CHANNELS IN THE HYDRATION OF OOCYTES IN MARINE FISHES. G. J. LaFleur. Jr. and P. Thomas. The University of Texas Marine Science Institute, Port Aransas. In many marine fishes oocyte volume increases during final maturation and hydration due to a rapid influx of water. In previous studies we found that the concentrations of specific monovalent ions were altered differentially during hydration. In the present study the role of monovalent ion channels in this process was investigated using in vitro incubations of Micrqpogonias undulatus oocytes stimulated with 5 I.U./ml human chononic gonadotropin (HCG). Addition of specific inhibitors of K+, Na-f, and Cl" channels partially blocked the increase in oocyte volume during hydration. Studies of the influence of K+ concentration on oocyte hydration showed that the degree of hydration was positively correlated to external K+ concentration over a range of 0-20 mmol. Analysis of Na+,K+-ATPase activity during the ovulatory cycle of Cynoscion nebulosus showed that the highest activity in oocytes occurred during hydration. These results suggest that monovalent ion channels are involved in the process of oocyte hydration. 855 ADRENERGIC REGULATION OF CELL MEMBRANE POTENTIAL AND SODIUM TRANSPORT IN NECTURUS URINARY BLADDER. fJ.JL. Thurman. University of Mis80uri-St. Louis. Necturus urinary bladders were mounted in an Ussing chamber for microelectrode irapalement. 10 pM norepinephrlne (NE) increased the transepithelial voltage (Vt) by 23 mV and short-circuit current (Isc) by 16 uA while decreasing resistance (Rt) 50%. The NE-stimulated Isc is blocked by 50 uM arailoride in the apical solution. The serosal receptors are more sensitive to NE than epinephrine or isoproterenol. Since these effects are blocked by phen- oxybenzamine, the serosal receptor is con? sidered to be alpha-adrenergic. Following microelectrode impalements, apical membrane voltage (Va) was 0 mV while that of the basolateral (Vb) was -85 mV. About 90% of Rt is contributed by the resistance of the apical membrane (Ra). After amiloride, Ra increases to 97% while Va and Vb hyperpolarize. On the other hand, NE treatment decreases Ra to 56% as Va becomes positive and Vb depolarizes. Paracellular resistance is unaffected by either amiloride or NE. Since membrane potentials and Ra correlate positively with Isc, NE appears to influence the eiectrical properties of the tissue by in? creasing the Na conductance of the apical membrane via a serosal receptor. 856 INFLUENCE OF HYDRIC ENVIRONMENT ON UPTAKE OF CALCIUM AND PHOSPHORUS BY EMBRYONIC SNAPPING TURTLES. M.J. Packard and G.C. Packard, Colorado State Univ., Fort Collins. Snapping turtle eggs were incubated on wet (water potential -150 kPa) and dry substrates (water potential -950 kPa). Embryos on wet substrates con? sumed more of their yolk, grew faster, and attained larger size before hatching than embryos on dry substrates. Develop? ing turtles withdrew virtually all of the calcium from their yolks and substan? tial ly reduced the amount of phosphorus in that compartment. Embryos developing on wet substrates mobilized much larger amounts of calcium from their eggshell than embryos on dry substrates. The total amount of calcium in yolk and carcass consequently increased during incubation from 12 mg to 48 mg on wet substrates, but only from 12 mg to 33 mg on dry ones. Although hatchlings from dry substrates contain much larger yolks than turtles from wet substrates, the yolk contains too little calcium to support appreciable growth of neonates. Thus, a large residual yolk in small hatchlings affords little more than a nutrient reserve for maintenance metabolism.

Intracellular pH values (pHi) of heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and brain were determined in deer mice during normothermy (n = 10) and during daily shallow torpor (Tb = 24.0 ? 1.4oC,n = 9). Temperature coefficients of pH from from normothermy to torpor were lowest for brain and plasma, highest for heart and liver, and intermediate for skeletal muscle. The pHi data measured at different temperatures were compared by calculating the corresponding dissociation ratios of protein imidazole groups (alphaimid). All tissues demonstrated a significant decrease of alphaimid in torpor corresponding to an intracellular acidification. The relative decrease was highest in brain (16.5%) and lowest in the heart and liver (8.5% and 9.0%, respectively). Skeletal muscle exhibited an intermediate decrease (11.0%). By comparison with normothermic controls, plasma and brain acid-base state of torpid mice corresponded to an uncompensated respiratory acidosis. A partial metabolic compensation of the acidosis was present in heart, liver, and skeletal muscle. Tissue acidosis and the accompanying reduction of alphaimid during torpor may be connected to energy economy by altering glycolytic and respiratory enzyme activities, and by modulating neural activities such as temperature regulation.</page><page sequence="161">Abstracts 161A 858 UPTAKE AND CATABOLISM OF TRI-N-BUTYLTINS BY BLUE CRABS FED TBT CONTAMINATED PREY. S.D. Rice. J.W. Short* and W.B. Stickle. NMFS, Auke Bay Laboratory, AK and Louisiana State Univ., Baton Rouge. Blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) are relatively tolerant to the antifouling paints containing Tri-n-butyl tins (TBT). Using a combination of GC-AA methods, we were able to measure TBT and metabolites in prey and crab tissues during a feeding test. Crabs were fed TBT contarainated shrimp (tissue concentration of 1.8 ppm) for 16 days. Feeding rates dropped from the initial rates of 50% of their body weight per day to final rates of about 15%. Final feeding rates of TBT exposed crabs were 65% of unexposed crabs. TBT was not metabolized in grass shrimp, but was sequentially debutylated by blue crabs. TBT concentrations peaked in crabs after 4 days of feeding at 0.12 ppm. DBT peaked after 12 days at 0.40 ppm, and MBT peaked at 16 days. Growth and molting success were affected in the juvenile crabs; at 16 days of exposure, growth was 60% of control crabs. Catabolism of TBT is successful in reducing tissue concentrations, and does aid in the tolerance of blue crabs to TBT. 859 THE EFFECTS OF METABOLIC WATER PRODUCTION ON DIET CHOICE BY A DESERT RODENT. CL. Frank. Univ. of California, Irvine. Kangaroo rats are granivorous desert rodents that do not drink free water, but depend on pref ormed water in their diet and metabolic water produced by food oxidation. At low water vapor pressures, oxidizing carbohydrates produces a net metabolic water gain, lipid metabolism produces a net water loss, and protein metabolism results in a large water loss. At high vapor pressures, carbohydrate metabolism again produces a net water gain, lipid oxidation produces a large water gain, and protein metabolism results in a large water loss. Diet preference experiments involving semi-synthetic diets tested the influence of net metabolic water production on the diet preferences of Dipodomys spectabilis. At low vapor pressures, the rodents preferi 1) intermediate protein, 2) high lipid, and 3) high carbohydrate diets. After water stress, low protein diets are preferred and the preference for high lipid diets decreases. At high vapor pressures, the rodents always preferred high lipid diets. These results indicate that kangaroo rats usually prefer diets that produce the largest metabolic water gain. 860 IMPOSEX EXISTS IN ALASKA, TOO. W. Stickle. J. W. Short*. S. D. Rice. and C. C. Brodersen , Louisiana State Univ., Baton Rouge, and Northwest and Alaska Fisheries Center, Auke Bay Laboratory, Auke Bay, AK. Female Nucella lima exposed to low concentrations of Tri-n-butyltin (TBT) by grow a penis and vas deferens. This condition, termed imposex occurs in N. lima along a TBT pollution gradient associated with a marina in Auke Bay, Alaska. The relative volumes of the female to male penis (RPS) increased from 0.0 to 34.3 and the vas deferens sequence index increased from 0.0 to 4.3 along this gradient. TBT concentrations in N. lima increased from below 0.01 ug Sn/g dry tissue weight to 0.07 ug Sn/g dry tissue weight along the gradient. The gradient in TBT concentration also existed in Mytilus edulis and increased from below detection limits to 0.83 ug Sn/g. Imposex, tissue TBT burden, and position along the TBT gradient are significantly correlated (P&lt;0.01) in N. lima. TBT was tested as a causative agent for imposex by exposing snails at a distant control site to TBT paint. After one month of exposure, 33% of the females grew a penis ranging in size from 0.2 to 0.8 mm. Our results corroborate those found for N. lapillus and indicate that imposex in N. lima is caused by environmental TBT exposure. 861 BEHAVIOURAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ALTERATIONS IN ENDOSULFAN-TREATED FISH. N. Vasantha, and Asfia Parveen* Nizam College, Hyderabad, India. Clarias batrachus exposed to 0.06 ppm Endosulfan (one-third of LC50, 96 hrs) exhibited faster swimming and more frequent surfacing associated with intense opercular and gulping activities. Total sugar and glycogen contents decreased and total free amino acid and lipid contents increased in muscle, gill, liver, pancreas, kidney and ovary. Altered behavioural response is attributed to hypoxic stress as a result of the inhibitory effect of endosulfan on respiration. Carbohydrates seem to be utilized to a greater extent under the pesticide stress leading to their depletion. Decreased incorporation into proteins and increased proteolysis may be responsible for increased free amino acid content while the tissue lipid levels reflect the rate of meta? bolism of the pesticide since there is a direct relationship between residue concentration and lipid levels.

Weldon and J^A. Williams. Texas A&amp;M Univ., College Station, and National Marine Fisheries Service, Galveston, TX. Almost all aquatic and semiaquatic turtles possess two or more pairs of Rathke's glands that release secretions through duct openings in the axillary, inguinal, and inframarginal areas. The patterns of Rathke's gland discharge in loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and Kemp's ridley (Lepidochelys kempi) sea turtles were examined by applying a probe to the axillary and inguinal regions. Glands near the source of stimulation routinely discharged, while those at the opposite pole and contralateral side did so rarely. More secretions were released in response to inguinal cues. The selective discharge of Rathke's glands in response to local, nociceptive stimuli is consistent with an antipredator function for the secretions. The results of palatability tests on different predators with these exudates are described.

L. C^ Javois. Catholic University of America, Washington, D. C. Head activator (HA), an eleven amino acid neuropeptide (&lt;pEPPGGSKVILF), was originally discovered in Hydra where it promoted head-specific growth and differ? entiation. In this study, non-budding adult Hydra oligactis were exposed to exogenous synthetic head activator (Bachem, Switzerland; courtesy of H. C. Schaller) for 18 hrs after which the apical quarter of the gastric column was excised and allowed to regenerate. Over a time course of 36 hrs following ex- cision, control and HA-treated regen? erates were fixed and stained with the monoclonal antibody, CP8, to follow the dynamics cf the head patterning proces? ses. HA treatment enhanced the rate of head regeneration as measured by the earlier appearance and faster spread of the CP8+ tissue which gives rise to the head. However, by 48 hrs when tenta? cles had evaginated, head patterning in control regenerates had caught up with the HA-treated regenerates.

To investigate pcsition-dependent growth during limb development in the mouse the combined use of exo-utero sur? gery and retroviral cell marking has been developed. Gonditioned media from a rep? lication defective retrovixus producing cell line (Y2infT8) is used to transfect cells in vitro. Transfected cells ex? press human surface glycoprotein (TB) and can be identified inraiunoMstcctemically. 1x1 Mk vitro studies both 3T3 cells and embryonic limb cells were transfected with labelling success approaching 100%. To test the feasibility of using a retro? viral vector to label and identify cells in vivo, Y2infT8 cells were injected into stage 11 hindlimbs of the mouse. Injec? ted limbs were harvested at various times and analyzed immunochemically. In all cases T8 positive cells were identified in the region of the injection. This includes one case in which an injected embryo was allowe d to develop to term, cross fostered, and analyzed 21 days after birth, thus showing that this ap? proach is useful for long term cell mar? king studies.

H.M.Mackev. Columbia University, N.Y, (spon. by L.R.Kraemer) Quail ectodermal tissues, age 36-40 hours were grown with regions of the chick git, ages 4-18 days, on the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). Qaail epithelial cells aggregated, multiplied, and organized themselves within the plane ofthe chick chor ionic ectoderm (che) in juxtaposition with the che cells. Quail cells differentiated in acccrdance with the che as a cubodial or stratfied squamous epithelium and confcrmed predsely to the height and type of the host chick epithelial at the site of the quail-che junction. The chick che appeared hypertrophied, and vacudated; and cells of the che- tissues were often separated from the basal lamina leaving a denuded surface and a displaced che that were both bounded by quail cells. Qiail cells invaded the 12-day escphagus and 17- day proventriculus and formed a quail stratfied squamous epithelium that juxtaposed and conformed to the heigjit of the chick epithelial cells. However, quail cells that invaded proventricular epithelium, made an abrupt but smooth squamcus(quail) to cdumnar (chick) junction. Quail mesenchymal cells were seen beneath the quail formed- epithelial sheets ofthe CAMand gut. In conclusion, (1) quail ectodermal epithelium'mesenchyme (epm) can invade and replace chick epm (gut or CXM) by a process that is destructive of chick tissue, (2) the regional locations of the host chick (epm) regulated the hei^it of epithelium and type of junctions formed between quail and chick tissues, (3) the capacity of quail epm to replace chick epm in many regions ofthe chick embryo indicates aheretoforeunsuspected form of metaplasia that merits further characterization.

Sessions, David M, Gardiner*. and Susan V. Bryant. University of California, Irvine. We have experimentally tested the similarity of limb pattern forming mechanisms in urodeles and anurans by performing two kinds of reciprocal limb bud grafts between Ambystoma and Xenopus: contralateral grafts to confront anterior and posterior positions of graft and host, and ipsilateral grafts to align equivalent circumferential positions. In either combination, when limb buds are grafted so as to align circumferential positions, the majority of limbs did not form any supernumerary digits. However, in experimental grafts, where anterior and posterior of host and graft were misaligned, supernumerary digits formed at positional discontinuities. Furthermore, Ambystoma and Xenopus cells can cooperate to build recognizable, chimeric skeletal elements, despite large differences in cell size and growth rate between the two species. We infer from these results that urodeles and anurans share the same limb pattern forming mechanisms, including compatible positional signals that allow appropriate localized cellular interactions between the two species. Our results suggest an approach for understanding homology of the tetrapod limb based on experimental cellular interactions. 867 SEQUENCE AND DEVELOPMENTAL PATTERN OF EXPRESSION OFA MANDUCA SEXTA HOMEO BOX WITH HOMOLOGY TO THE DROSOPHILA ABDOMINAL-A GENE. LM.Naqy. R.Booker. and LM.Riddiford. Univ. of Washington, Seattle. Many insect species segment with overtly different morphological patterns than Drosophila. To understand how these morphological differences are controlled, we have begun to isolate segmentation and homeotic genes from a lepidopteran, Manduca sexta. By using sequence homology to the Drosophila Antennapedia homeo box, we have isolated a Manduca homeo box gene. This homeo box and the regions immediately flanking it could encode 76 amino acids of a protein with 100% similarity to the putative translation product of the Drosophila abdominal-A homeo box containing exon. A 4.7 kb poly A+ mRNA, which hybridizes to a probe from the Manduca abd-A gene is found in post-gastrulation embryos, as well as in larval and pupal epidermis, muscle and nervous system. These data indicate that the homeotic genes are likely to be strongly conserved within other insects and will provide useful tools for analyzing the fundamental principles of segmentation in insects.

Skates obtained at The Laboratory, Marine Biol. Assoc. of the U.K., Plymouth, England, were utilized to determine the relative growth rates of the entire body, the neurocranium, and the endoskeletal tesserae of the neurocranium. Skeletal material was prepared from 35 specimens 0T~ R?J*a clavata and 20 of Raja montagui. Flesh was removed by immersion in hot (60 C) water. Neurocrania were preserved by dehydration in alcohol and drying in air. Photographs of skeletal parts were taken with a Leitz micro-adaptor and 35-mm camera mounted in one ocular of a stereoscopic microscope. Small skates have about the same body proportions as large ones. The growth coefficient for neurocranial growth relative to that of the whole body is approximately 1.0, and similarly the coefficient for the growth of individual tesserae is around 1.0. Growth of the neurocranium and its calcified tesserae follows the isogonic, indeterminate pattern characteristic of total body growth in elasmobranch and teleost fishes. 869 COMPETITION MEDIATED HOST- PARASITE INTERACTIONS INVOLVING TWO SPECIES OF TERRESTRIAL ISOPODS. E.D. Grosholz. Univ. of California, Berkeley. The effects of competition for food resources betweem two species of terrestrial isopods on the transmission of a lethal virus were examined in laboratory experiments. Porcellio scaber and Porcellio laevis were maintained in one and two species containers both with and without additional food at the time of virus introduction. Virus transmission occurs when dead, infected isopods are placed in the containers and are scavenged by susceptible isopods. The results indicate that the presence of congeneric isopods may alter the probability of becoming infected by the virus relative to the same number of conspecifics. This process is mediated by differential scavenging ability and competition for other food resources. This study suggests that the competitive winner may ultimately be the loser.</page><page sequence="164">164A American Society of Zoologists 870 GEOGRAPHIC AND SEASONAL VARIATION IN FRAGRANCE CHOICES AND PREFERENCES OF MALE EUGLOSSINE BEES.

The euglossine bee assemblages of Barro Colorado Island and Cerro Campana, Panama, were censused during a 1-yr bait- ing program utilizing 16 chemical attrac- tants. Fragrance choices were the chemi? cals to which a species was attracted. Species bait preferences were measured by the frequencies of individuals at bait choices. The bees shared choices but each species was attracted to a unique set of baits. For some species, choices of infrequently visited chemicals differ? ed among sites. Substantial intraspeci? fic variation in fragrance preferences occurred and was related to some combina? tion of season, geography and bee age. The degree to which natural fragrance availability and genetic differences among individuals affect fitness and variation in fragrance choices and pre? ferences of euglossine bees remains unknown. 871 TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF SEARCHING SPEED AND PREY-FINDING IN A PREDACIOUS PHYTOSEIID MITE. P.E. Hertz and F. Gould. Barnard College, Columbia Univ., New York, NY, and North Caroiina State Univ., Raleigh. The ability of searching predators to locate potential prey is at least partly dependent on the speed with which the predators can explore suitable habitats. We determined the effect of temperature on searching speed and on prey-finding in phytoseiid mites (Amblyseius fallacis) over a broad temperature range. Tests were made in a laboratory arena using the eggs of two-spotted spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) as prey. Searching speed shows more dramatic temperature-dependence than does prey-finding, and the two functions do not vary in parallel with temperature. The effect of temperature on prey-finding does not therefore simply mirror the effect of temperature on searching rate. These data suggest that increased search speed does not necessarily promote greater prey-finding success in these mites. 872 EFFECTS OF BACKGROUND PATTERN ON INSECT PERCEPTION AND AVOIDANCE OF SPIDER WEBS. CL. Craig. Yale Univ., New Haven. Spiders suspend orb webs at sites that differ in light level as well as back? ground plant density, structure and leaf size. Field experiments show that in open sites (bright environments), insects are less successful in perceiving webs spun in front of patterned backgrounds than those suspended in front of solid backgrounds. Small patterns close to the web*s plane are most effective in obscuring its outlines. However, in sub-canopy forest sites (dim environments) and tree falls (fluctuating light environ? ments), web background has little affect on insect perception and avoidance. These experiments reveal the importance of the webfs visual environment to the foraging performance of orb weaving spiders. 873 THE EFFECT OF A PRIMARY PREDATOR, THE GRASS SHRIMP PALAEMONETES PUGIO, ON THE COMPOSITION OF AN ESTUARINE BENTHIC COMMUNITY. M.H. Posey. Smithsonian Envir. Res. Center, Edgewater, MD. Recent studies have suggested that primary predators may have a significant effect on faunal abundances in a variety of habitats and that their control by higher carnivores may indirectly determine community composition. The potential importance of one such primary predator, the grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio, was examined in the Chesapeake Bay through a combination of field enclosures and laboratory experiments. Enclosure studies indicate that the grass shrimp can affect the abundances of several macrofaunal species. However, the addition of a shrimp predator with the grass shrimp can enhance the densities of at least certain macro? faunal prey. Laboratory observations indicate that the grass shrimp may be acting primarily as a meiofaunal predator, with several macrofauna being vulnerable to shrimp predation only as juveniles. These results emphasize the potential importance of primary predators in regu? lating faunal abundances and support the hypothesis that indirect effects resulting from interactions between predator guilds can be a significant factor determining community composition.</page><page sequence="165">Abstracts 165A 874 MAINTENANCE OF INTERTIDAL ALGAL TURFS THROUGH CARNIVORY. Carlos Robles and Jack Robb, California State Univ., Los Angeles. Like many other rocky shores in warm temperate to tropical latitudes, the mid to low intertidal zone of California's Channel Islands is covered by a turf of coralline and fleshy red algae. Field experiments demonstrated that carnivores, principally lobsters (Palinuridae) and fishes (Labridae), maintained the turfs by removing potential competitors, Mytilus spp., and herbivores, limpets and chitons. Predator dynamics varied with location. Consequently, on wave washed sites, a short-term removal of lobsters was sufficient to cause a perennial mussel assemblage to displace the turf. On a sheltered shore, compensatory foraging shifts by whelks negated effects of lobster and fish removals. 875 A COMPARISON OF PREDATION UPON TWO SPECIES OF CRABS, LADY CRABS OVALIPES OCELLATUS AND BLUE CRABS CALLINECTES SAPIDUS IN TWO HABITATS. D.E. Barshaw, K.W. Able*. Rutgers University Marine Field Station, Tuckerton, NJ 08087 We present evidence that the distribution of two portunid species is partially a function of differential predation in different habitats. In laboratory experiments lady crabs buried deeper into sand than blue crabs and burial in sand was shown to protect lady crabs from predation by larger blue crabs. In a field experiment lady crabs and blue crabs were tethered and placed in sand and macroalgae/mud habitats. In the sand habitat only 10% of the small (&lt;A.0 g) blue crabs survived compared to 63% of the small lady crabs. There was no difference in survival between large (&gt;A.0 g) crabs of the two species (65% survived). In the macroalgae/mud habitat there were no differences in survival between size classes of crabs or between the two species of crabs (60% survived). Lady crabs have a specialized mechanism for respiration which allows them to bury deeply in sand. Our evidence suggests that this adaptation allows the small lady crabs to use a refuge unavailable to other species of crabs and thus explains their abundance in sand. 876 COMPARATIVE FEEDING ECOLOGY OF JUVENILE COHO AND CHINOOK IN THE OCEAN: THE IMPORTANCE OF THE NEUSTON R.D. Brodeur. Univ. of Washington, Seattle. Interannual, seasonal, geographic, and ontogenetic variations in the prey composition of juvenile coho and chinook salmon were examined from purse seine collections in coastal waters off Washington and Oregon. The diets of these species were similar consisting of fishes, euphausiids, decapod larvae, and hyperiid amphipods. Substantial interannual and seasonal variations in the feeding habits of these two species were apparent which may be related to the highly variable oceanographic conditions occurring during the sampling period. Geographic and size-related variations were less pronounced for both species. There was a resemblance between the diet of coho and the species composition of neustonic zooplankton collections suggesting that this species forages in surface waters. 877 ONTOGENETIC DIETARY CHANGES AND SE- LECTIVITY OF POSTMETAMORPHIC FLAT- FISH IN A SUBARCTIC ECOSYSTEM. S_^_ McGreaor and T. Shirley. Univ. of Alaska Fairbanks. Postmetamorphic flatfish (Yel- lowfin sole, Limanda aspera [=YS]; Rock sole, Lepidopsetta bilineata [RS]; Starry flounder, Platichthys stellatus [SF]) and meiofauna were collected intertidally at 2 wk in? tervals from Mar to Oct and monthly during winter in Auke Bay, AK to examine diet composition and selec- tivity with ontogeny. Similar on? togenetic dietary shifts occurred for all species, with harpacticoid copepods being a major dietary com? ponent until fish reached a length of 3 0 mm (snout-hypural), when mac- rofauna were predominate prey. Set? tlement of fish did not coincide with peak density of harpacticoids or total meiofauna. RS and SF were first collected July 27; YS were first found Sept 8. Harpacticoids comprised 23-76% of total meio? fauna seasonally, attaining peak density on May 13 (4237*10 cm"2); total meiofaunal density was hig? hest on May 28 (7500'10 cm"2).

J.L. Wulff. Yale University, New Haven, CT. Sponges are conspicuous in their abundance, large size, and bright coloration on Caribbean coral reefs. Lack of sponges in gut contents of most Caribbean reef fishes (Randall &amp; Hartman, 1968) suggests that sponges can be conspicuous because they are not eaten. Some sponge species are not conspicuous, however, but live hidden within the reef frame. They appear to be restricted to this cryptic habitat by predation. When cryptic sponges are exposed to potential predators, many of the species are eaten by fishes that are not considered to be sponge-feeders. Chief among these are parrotfishes of the genus Sparisoma. The fish return over and over to the proffered sponges, vigorously chasing each other away until the sponges have been completely consumed. The fish are able to distinguish cryptic sponges as edible, as demonstrated by their rejection of pieces of normally conspicuous sponges when these are mixed with exposed cryptic sponges. Cryptic sponges are able to grow out of their cavities in the reef when protected by seasonally thick Dictyota mats or by cages that exclude fish. 879 HIGH RESOLUTION UNDERWATER IMAGING FOR QUANTIFYING MARINE INVERTEBRATE FORAGING. CL. Kitting. California State Univ., Hayward. Direct close-up observations in situ lack convenience and resolution, partic? ularly for detecting effects of animals on small foods. Disturbance to the anim? al and poor lighting are avoided with ver- satile, inexpensive photographic supplies. Risk of equipment damage and expense are minimized with a pliable vinyl hous- ing for most cameras, versatile above and below water. Lenses from f = 24~105 mm, used at f/22 near minimum focus (a- 25x35 cm area) are useful in the housing. A &lt; 10 x 15 cm area is best, with an extension tube. Resolution reaches^ 1500 lines per field (resolving~ 50 um). A normally impractical underwater flash system is not necessary when a standard electronic flash is used in the camera housing. A standard slave accessory triggers an additional flash in a separate vinyl bag. Resulting color transparencies are studied under a dissecting microscope at ~10 X, where quantitative sampling is performed on such an optical quadrat. Time-lapse non-destructive comparisons are made with an improvised blink comparator, documenting rare feeding influences of diverse marine invertebrates. 880 FEEDING CURRENTS OF IDMIDRONEA (BRYOZOA; CYCLOSTOMATA): CONTRARY FLOW DIRECTION DUE TO PHYLOGENETIC CONSTRAINT. F.K. McKinney, Appalachian State University, Boone, N.C. Contrary to the direction of flow in other erect unilaminate branched bryozoans, Idmidronea draws water from the reverse sides of branches, filters food as it passes between branches, then sends filtered water above the frontal surface. This results from a gradient in zooid and polypide size and shape across branches, with the largest and most asymmetrical polypides In the most centrally placed, frontal zooids. The longest tentacles of the asymmetrical lophophores are frontal, curve away from the frontal surface, and project laterally beyond those of zooids closer to the lateral edges. Action of lateral cilia on the tentacles of these obliquely-truncated lophophores draws water from above, which in this orientation is the region beyond the reverse side. This 'reverse' direction of flow of feeding currents of Idmidronea appears to be due to its phylogenetic history, in which an erect, branched form evolved from an encrusting tubuliporid ancestor, keeping a marginal gradient in zooid size, with food-bearing water drawn across smaller, lateral zooids towards more centrally placed larger zooids. 881 THE SCALING OF CLEARANCE RATE AND CILIARY BAND LENGTH IN ECHINOPLUTEI. M.W. Hart. Univ. of Washington, Seattle. Feeding rate is known to be proportional to the length of the ciliary band in those invertebrate larvae that employ the single band upstream particle capture method, but the exact nature of the proportionality (for different stages of a single species) was previously unknown. Clearance rates were estimated from videotapes of free-swimming sea urchin larvae (Stronavlocentrotusdroebachiensisl clearing a solution of 20 |im diameter polystyrene spheres. Clearance rates sealed linearly with ciliary band length, supporting the notion that the pluteus form is adapted mainly for feeding. How clearance rates scale with size in other feeding larval forms (eg: asteroids, holothuroids, hemichordates, inarticulate brachiopods) that employ the same capture method remains open.</page><page sequence="167">Abstracts 167A 882 FEEDING BEHAVIOUR OF HOLOTHURIAN LARVAE T.H.J. Gilmour. Univ. of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada The larvae of Stichopus californianus were videotaped while swimming freely in suspensions of unicellular algae. These animals capture food particles by tempor- ary changes in the beat of the locomotory cilia. Stimulation of the locomotory band by collision with an algal cell is followed by a reversal in the direction of spin of the larva. The normal anti- clockwise spin may be resumed in a few milliseconds after the larva has rotated just a few degrees clockwise. During such a brief change in spin direction the animal may continue to swim forward at near normal speed. Longer reversals in the direction of spin can be accompanied by more obvious changes in the pattern of swimming. The feeding behaviour of holothurian larvae is very different from that of echinoid and asteroid larvae. In these animals food particles are captured without changes in the direction of spin by the diversion of water currents into suboral cavities which are provided with cilia beating towards the mouth. In hol? othurian larvae the only cilia which beat towards the mouth are on the pre-oral band and water currents are not diverted into the suboral cavity during normal anti-clockwise rotation. 883 FEEDING DYNAMICS BY PLANKTQTROPHIC ASTEROID LARVAE IN OLIGQTRQPHIC ENVIRONMENTS. It Bosch and RL *L Bi^B-lQ* Univ. of Ca. , Santa Cruz and Horn Pt. Labs. Univ. of Maryland, Cambridge. Larvae of Luidia sp. are abundant in surface waters of the Gulf Stream and Sargasso Sea. Freshly collected bipinnariae can ingest heterotrophic bacteria, autotrophic picoplankton and larger algae. Natural abundances of potential algal and bacterial prey show significant spatial and temporal variability. Larvae ingest ambient concentrations of both bacteria and algae in the Gulf Stream, but only bacteria are in? gested in the Sargasso Sea. During the summer, ambient phytoplankton concentrations in the Sargasso Sea are below the threshold for inges? tion. For example, phytoplankton were ingested when natural abund? ances were enhanced 5 to 10 fold, These results suggest that bacteria and patches with elevated phyto? plankton concentrations support the growth and development of these 1arvae. 884 OPTIMAL FEEDING B Y GASTROPOD LARVAE: PATCHES AND PICOPLANKTON. i L. Bell Univ. of Hawaii, Honolulu. For marine invertebrate larvae, actual growth rates in the plankton are difficult to determine. Thus, rates resulting from laboratory culture are generally considered the best estimates of larval growth. The prosobranch gastropod, Crucibulum spinosum. was chosen to compare growth rates in various types of natural seawater. Coastal seawater was concentrated by reverse filtration through a 2 um Nucleopore filter to 1/3 its orginal volume. The concentrated seawater contained unusually high concentrations of particles &gt; 2 um simulating concentrated patches. The filtrate contained only particles &lt; 2 um (picoplankton), however, at the normal concentration. Larvae were grown in concentrated seawater, seawater filtrate, normal seawater, and seawater diluted to 1/2 its normal concentration. Larvae fed phytoplankton in .45 um millipore-filtered seawater served as a control. Larvae grew fastest in the control and metamorphosed in 14 days. In treatments, growth rates were highest in concentrated seawater with metamorphosis in 22 days. The next lowest growth rate was normal seawater followed by a similar growth rate for both 1/2 diluted and picoplankton. Larvae can utilize concentrations of natural particles to increase growth, yet they may also grow slowly on picoplankton when nothing else is available. 885 FEEDING IN LECITHOTROPHIC LARVAE OF HALIOTIS RUFESCENS: UPTAKE OF DISSOLVED AMINO ACIDS FROM SEAWATER. W.B. Jaeckle and D.T. Manahan. Dept. Biol. Sci., Univ. of Southern Calif., Los Angeles, CA. Larvae of the red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) are nonfeeding. However, we have found that veliger larvae of this species can gain energy by transporting dissolved organic material directly from seawater. When larvae were presented with a mixture of 16 amino acids (100 nM per substrate) all classes of amino acid were removed, and the influx of alanine equaled the net substrate flux. Transported alanine was rapidly metabolized. With increasing larval age, a greater percent? age of the radioactivity appeared in the small molecular weight acid-soluble fraction (44% in 3-day-old; 80% in 6-day- old). The percent of transported alanine simultaneously released as 14C-C02 by larvae was 19% (3-day-old) and 15% (6-day- old) of total uptake. A comparison of the energy provided by amino acid uptake, with the metabolic demand (oxygen consumption), revealed that 31-55% of the metabolic rate could be supplied by the uptake of amino acids from a concentration of 1.6 uM. Thus, these "nonfeeding" larvae can feed, but their source of exogenous energy exists in a dissolved form.</page><page sequence="168">168A American Society of Zoologists 886 FEEDING RATES AND PREY SELECTIVITY OF CALLINECTES SAPIDUS. J^ jL. McConaugha. Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA Capture of sufficient prey to meet energy demands and dietary requirements appears to be a major factor in determining meroplankton survival. Decapod crustacean larvae can withstand short periods of starvation but at the cost of ex? tended larval development. Experi? ments were designed to measure feeding rates of blue crab larvae at various concentrations of prey, prey selectivity and diurnal varia? tions in feeding. Zoea (stages 1 to 7) and megalopae were offered rotifer, Artemia nauplii and nauplii and copepidites of Acartia tonsa. Initial data indicate that consumption increases with increas? ing concentration up to approx. 4,000 prey/m^. Zoea larvae tend to feed at higher rates during night time. Megalopae feed at higher levels during daylight. The ability to select prey based on size or "quality appears to be minimal.

Pletl and J.R. McConaugha. Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA. Feeding experiments based on two diets were conducted using individual larvae to determine if dietary fatty acids affect larval feeding rates. Preliminary data suggest that feeding rate is not affected by availability of w3 fatty acids. These experiments also established the amount of energy, carbon and nitrogen required by larvae of this species. The basal metabolic rates of all larval stages were estimated by measuring the respiration rates of larvae whose guts had been cleared. Basal metabolism indicates the minimum amount of energy required for the larvae to survive.The amount of energy required to develop unhindered is approximately one order of magnitude greater than that required to survive. By comparing these values with the average availability of energy, carbon and nitrogen in the field, one can estimate the success of larval survival and development. The impact of prey availability and the importance of food patchiness to our understanding of the biological determinants which affect blue crab recruitment can be estimated from these studies. ARE URICOLYTIC PRODUCTS OF NEPHROMYCES INCORPORATED BY MOLGULA? M.B. Saffo. Univ. of California, Santa Cruz. The high urate oxidase activity of the renal sac endosymbiont Nephromyces indi- cates that urate is not deposited perm- anently in the renal sac of Molgula. To follow,the fate of uricolytic metabol- ites, C-urate was injected into the renal sac of field-collected (symbiont- infected) M. manhattensis. One hour after injection, 90% of C-dpm was still localized in the renal sac, especially in renal sac fluid- After longer incu? bation, however, C-dpm was more dis? persed, with, on average, 25% of the radioactivity distributed outside the renal sac. In most animals incubated 5 to 24 hours after injection, an,. especially high concentration of C was detected in the neural gland complex. ,. Dispersal of C suggests that products of Nephromyces' uricolytic activity are ultimately released from the renal sac, and may be incorporated into particular regions of host tissue.

Paralvinella pandorae (Fam. Alvinellidae) is known only from not vents in the north- east Pacific; it inhabits a mucous sheath attached to vestimentiferan tubes. TEM and SEM studies show that the sperm of this species, which is stored in mixonephridia, is of a highly modified type. The flagellum, which exhibits a 9+2 microtubular arrangement, emerges asymmetrically from the cell. In the middle piece, several large mitochondria occur anterior and posterior to a peculiar convoluted, opaque structure. This structure is apparently of mitochondrial derivation, and is reminescent of the Nebenkern of insects and some molluscs. Many granules surround the mitochondria; PAS tests indicate that these granules are composed of glycogen. The elongated nucleus (6.0u,m - 7.5u.m in length) contains chromatin condensed into a loose ladder-like network. Anterior to the nucleus, the cell extends to form a long narrow apex, which contains numerous glycogen-like granules. As yet, no acrosome has been observed. From this aberrant sperm structure, it is evident that P. pandorae has a specialized mode of fertilization. Spermatophore transfer, followed by incubation of embryos, seems to be the most likely reproductive mode for this species; this would facilitate repopulation of vents, but could severely limit dispersal of this species to other vent fields.</page><page sequence="169">Abstracts 169A 890 UNUSUAL GONADS AND BIZARRE GAMETES FROM DEEP-SEA ECHINODERMS. K.J. Eckelbarger, CM. Young and J.l. Cameron. Harbor Branch Oceanographic Inst., Ft. Pierce, FL. Ultrastructural observations have been made on the gonads and gametes of 25 species of echlnoderms collected with manned submerslbles at depths ranging to 2100 meters 1n Hawaiian and 915 meters 1n Bahamlan waters. The gonads of most species are similar to those from shallow water. However, developing oocytes 1n the ovaries of some holothurlans are surrounded by podocytes, cells generally assoclated with the ultraflltratlon of body fluids. This Is the first report of podocytes 1n an echlnoderm gonad and suggests some unique role 1n the transport of yolk precursors Into the ovary. Mature sperm examined from asterolds, holothurlans and ophlurolds reveled no unique morphological modification. However, 1n comparison to shallow water spedes, many of the deep-water echlnolds we examined have sperm with unusually long heads and two spedes have highly aberrant sperm. The sperm of a dladematold spedes has a thin, slckle-shaped nucleus reaching 25 um 1n length while a spatangold spedes appears to have two kinds of .sperm Including one having both a posteriorly and anteriorly directed flagellum. The 11fe history, phylogenetic and ecological significance of these peculiar adaptations are discussed. 891 SOMATIC TISSUES IN THE OVARIES OF CHAETOGNATHS. G.L. Shinn. Northeast Missouri State Univ. , Kirksville. Somatic tissues in the ovaries of chaetognaths mediate the rapid production of successive clutches of eggs, fertilization, ovulation, and egg laying. Transmission electron microscopy has revealed that the ovaries of Sagitta hi spida contain four somatic tissues . The ovary wall, a myoepithelial extension of the peritoneum, encloses all other ovarian tissues in a retro- peritoneal ovarian space. The so- called oviduct, a blind-ended cellular tube, is lateral in the ovarian space. Its "lumen" is occluded by a syncytial seminal receptacle, previously reported to be lacking from jSj^ hispida. Vitellogenic oocytes lie medial to the oviduct and are attached to specialized oviductal cells. Oocytes are ensheathed by thin extensions of a syncytial follicular layer not previously known to exist in chaetognaths. Oviductal cells exocytose a product, posssibly yolk pre? cursors, Into the ovarian space. 892 LOCATION OF FERTILIZATION IN MEMBRANIPORA MEMBRANACEA M.H. Temkin. Univ. of So. Calif., Los Angeles, CA 90089 The fertilization process in the free-spawning bryozoan Membranipora membranacea was studied by examining live eggs stained with a DNA-specific fluorochrome, Bisbenzimide 33342, and fixed stages stained with aceto-orcein. These studies re? vealed that primary oocytes are fertilized within the maternal coelomic cavity soon after ovulation. However, fertilized eggs do not begin to develop until they are spawned. After spawning, two maturation divisions occur. Then as typical of eggs fertilized as primary or secondary oocytes, the two pro- nuclei do not fuse. Instead chromosomes condense within each pronucleus and assume their places on the first metaphase plate. Although fertilization is usually monospermic, a rare case of polyspermy was observed. 893 PHOTOPERIODIC REGULATION OF SPAWNING IN THE VIVIPAROUS POLYCHAETE NEANTHES LIMNICOLA FROM CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. P.P. FONG. Univ. of California, Santa Cruz. Culture experiments under controlled photoperiod conditions revealed that the viviparous polychaete Neanthes limnicola spawns mainly in spring-summer light regimes, independent of birth date. Worms born in culture in the spring spawn in 6-8 months if kept under light regimes 6 months out-of-phase with ambi? ent light conditions. Worms maintained under ambient (in-phase) photoperiods take about one year to spawn. Similarly, worms born in culture during the fall and maintained in-phase spawn in 6-8 months; out-of-phase worms spawn at about one year of age. F? generations respond sim? ilarly to adults. Natural populations spawn mainly during the spring and summer although sexually mature worms can usual? ly be found at any month of the year. The functional significance of photoperi- odic regulation of spawning in a vivipa? rous polychaete is discussed.</page><page sequence="170">170A American Society of Zoologists 894 CHEMICAL STRUCTURE OF SEX PHERO- MONES OF THE MARINE POLYCHAETE PLATYNEREIS DUMERILII. E. Zeeck. Univ. Oldenburg, West Germany. The reproductive behavior of Platynereis dumerilii is regulated by a bouquet of sex pheromones. Some of these pheromones are lipo? philic, volatile compounds which could be isolated by closed loop stripping techniques from the water. They were identified by GC- MS and by synthesis in vitro using electrophysiological and behavior? al assays for testing the activi? ty. Up to now four pheromones are chemically identified by this method. S(+)-5-methyl-3-heptanone and 5-methyl-decane are emitted by the males and detected by the fe? males, R(-)-5-methyl-3-heptanone and 3,5-octadienone-2 are released by the females and acting on the males. The substances show close relationship to pheromones of in? sects. Annelids and insects have the same root in evolution. The results show that the evolutionary step from the aquatic to the ter? restrial environment did not nec? essarily include a change in the chemical nature of the pheromones used by the species. 895 EVIDENCE FOR A PUTATIVE SPAWNING STIMULATING PHERMONE IN FORCIPULATE STARFISHES. R. L. Miller. Temple University, Philadelphia. A peptide responsible for sperm chemotaxis in forcipulate starfishes is released into the surrounding water by sexually ripe females of Orthasterias koehleri and Asterias forbesi. The attractant can be captured from filtered sea water using columns of XAD-7 resin. The sperm attractant thus provides a chemical tag for sea water that has been in the vicinity of ripe female starfishes. Regular testing of both the Friday Harbor Labs sea water system flow and water in the harbor indicates that sperm attractant- bearing water incursions occur frequently during the reproductive season. The timing of spawning of animals held in the lab can be correlated with the timing of these incursions. The sperm attractant or other organic molecules released with it by female starfishes may serve as spawning stimulators. The attractant could serve as a measure of female "readiness to spawn" and act as a stimulus to nearby males to initiate a spawning event. 896 BROODING IN A CHITON: WHY SYNCHRONIZE TO SELF-FERTILIZE? D. J. Eemisse. Museum of Zool? ogy and Dept. of Biology, Univ. of Michigan, Ann Ar- bor,MI 48109. Members of the hermaphroditic chiton species, Lepidochitonafernaldi Eemisse (Mollusca: Polyplacopho- ra), appear to regularly self-fertilize, as indicated by their ability-to produce fertilized broods in isolation, and by a paternity analysis in which over 1000 progeny of paired- isolation experiments were electrophoreticaUy examined. Because paired potential parents were known to differ at an enzyme-coding locus, and all progeny were homozy- gous, identical to their mothers, the results indicated that not a single cross-fertilization event had occurred. Simi? larly, in field samples of adult L.fernaldi, heterozygous individuals were never found at the few loci known to be polymorphic. It is puzzling then, that Lepidochitona brooders, in general, show a high degree of synchrony in brood fertilization, supported by extensive field observa? tions. This synchrony is most striking for gonochoric brooders, including L. thomasi (Pilsbry) and L. corrugata (Reeve), e.g., one sample of 114 L. thomasi adults re? vealed 31 brooders, all which had synchronous 2 (?1) day old broods. Here, synchrony could be explained as an adaptation to ensure fertilization, yet then it would be difficult to explain why the apparently self-fertilizing L. fernaldi (and L. caverna Eemisse) also have synchronous brooding activity. On several separate occasions in the lab, adjacent individuals of L.fernaldi were observed to lay broods which, when coUected soon after, were at the same early cleavage state. Field studies also have indicat? ed that brooders tend to be most closely synchronizcd with their neighbors. This leaves an interesting paradox: either L.fernaldi occasionaUy cross-fertilizes, apparently below present levels of detection, or synchrony is main? tained for some other reason. 897 DEVELOPMENTAL CYCLE OF PELAGIA COLORATA (SCYPHOZOA: PELAGIIDAE). F.A. Sommer. Monterey Bay Aquarium, Monterey, CA. Planula larvae were obtained from adult Pelacria colorata medusae in order to observe their development in the lab. Larvae settled and metamorphosed into scyphistomae, which multiplied by producing pedal cysts from which new scyphistomae emerged. Polyps were fed Artemia nauplii and rotifers. Strobilation began about 13 weeks after larval settlement, each polyp producing 2 0-25 ephyrae. Juvenile medusae have been raised to 3cm bell diameter on a diet of Artemia nauplii, rotifers, hydromedusae, Aurelia ephyrae, and ctenophores. At this size they have 8 marginal tentacles, well- developed oral arms and gastric filaments, and a distinctive pattern of pigmentation. All stages are maintained at 15?C. The polyp of P. colorata has yet to be found in the field. Pelaqia noctiluca. the well-studied Atlantic representative of the genus, has no scyphistoma; rather, the larva metamorphoses directly into a free- swimming ephyra.</page><page sequence="171">Abstracts 171A 898 EFFECT OF LARVAL DURATION ON POST-IARVAL LIFESPAN AND FECUNDITY OF A NUDIBRANCH MDLLUSC. ff. tc. mtttirr. Univ. of Hawaii, Honolulu. Does the amount of time spent as a competent larva effect the time spent as a juvenile and adult, or is the post- larval lifespan independent of larval duration? Fed larvae of Phestilla sibogae maintained their original hatching weight throughout 28 days of larval life. Weekly subsamples of larvae were induced to metamorphose and isolated pairs of slugs were fed ad libitum for the remainder of their lifespans (2-3 months). A 7-21 day increase in the duration of the competent larval period did not affect the duration of the juvenile and adult periods, or the fecundity during the first week of reproduction. The increase in lifespan equaled the amount of increase in the larval period. These findings suggest that larval metamorphic competence is a hiatus during which developmental programs are arrested and individuals, in effect, do not age. Consequently, there is no reduction in the duration of the adult period. Thus, individuals that are recruiting to populations incur no post- larval reduction in fitness as a result of an extended larval period. 899 AN ANALYSIS OF ALL0ZYME VARIATION, GENETIC SUBDIVISION, AND GENE FLOW BETWEEN POPULATIONS OF THREE ALLOPATRIC SUBSPECIES OF THE PHYLLOSTOMID BAT STURNIRA LILIUM. J.D. Holman and I.F.Greenbaum*. Texas A&amp;M Univ. Overall genetic divergence for allo- zyme loci based on % polymorphic loci, mean heterozygosity and Nei's genetic distance was low for the species Stur- nira lilium. There is nothing in this data that would reject the hypothesis that this geographically diverse species is not panmictic. However, calculation of fixation indices indi? cated substantial subdivision between allopatric subspecies of S. lilium. Calculated average number of migrants exchanged between subspecies yielded Nm values &lt; 1 for subspecific pair- ings. Therefore, the current level of gene flow among subspecies of S. lilium is insufficient to prevent divergence due to genetic drift. Cal? culation of mean Fst and Nm values for 3 sympatric species of South American Sturnira revealed values very similar to those for the allopatric subspecies of S. lilium. Gene diversity analysis of subspecies for S. lilium indicates genetic subdivision is principally found either within populations or among subspecies. This pattern of subdivision suggests possible mechanisms to explain speciation within the genus Sturnira. 900 RELATIONSHIPS OF SOUTH AMERICAN CRICETID RODENTS BASED ON DNA HYBRIDIZATION. A.W. Dickerman Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison. Although the unity of the primarily South American genera placed in the Sigmodontinae (Rodentia: Cricetidae) by Reig (1981) has long been suspected, Carleton and Musser (1984) were unable to diagnose this taxon using morphology. Thermal elutions of whole-genome DNA hybrids were analyzed by tree- fitting of the delta-Tm matrix. Closer relationships were found among the oryzomyines, akodonts, phyllotines, and sigmodonts than between these and the North American taxa Neotoma and Peromys? cus . The latter form a clade to the exclusion of the sigmodon- tines. The sigmodontines and the neotomine-peromyscines are more closely related to eachother than either is to cricetines or microtines. Within the sigmodon? tines, Akodon and Graomys form a clade to the exclusion of Oryzo- mys, and Sigmodon lies outside these three. 901 MORPHOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS AND ALBUMIN EVOLUTION IN DIPODOID RODENTS. B.R. Stein and W.E. Rainey.* Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, Univ. of California, Berkeley. The distinctive nature of the superfamily Dipoidea (birch mice, jumping mice, and Asian jerboas) has long been recognized although previous systematic analyses have failed to identify the sister group to this clade or adequately to resolve its intergeneric relationships. Dissections of hind limb muscles revealed sufficient myological differences among genera to warrant continued separation of the Zapodidae and Dipodidae at the familial level. Morphologie characters also indicated that Sicista is the most primitive genus within this clade. An independent biochemical analysis using pooled rabbit antisera to purified dipodoid serum albumins confirmed that this superfamily forms a clade relative to other rodents and suggests that Sicista is not a primitive zapodid. Rather it is the sister group to all other dipodoids. Distances among dipodoid genera are small compared to those between dipodoids and other rodent lineages. Moreover, no other rodent lineage yet tested seems to be closely associated with this group.</page><page sequence="172">172A American Society of Zoologists 902 ANALYSIS OF MICROGEOGRAPHIC VARIA?

Papasula abbotti is not a booby and is most likely the sister taxon to Sula plus Morus. For the morphometric analysis I employed "sheared" principal components procedures to examine differences in skeletal wing shape among the various levels in the phylogenetic hierarchy. Four separate analyses were used. Differences at the generic level (Morus vs. Sula). the level separating &amp;. sula from the rest of Sula. and the level of S. leucogaster vs. the core Sula triad, involved changes in the shape of the sternum and coracoid, and length of the ulna. Differences among species showed that changes in ulna length are more responsive to specific differences in foraging behavior and more prone to convergence than some changes in the sternum and coracoid. 904 PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS AMONG CRANES (AVES:GRUIFORMES) BASED ON DNA HYBRIDI^ ZATION. CAREY KRAJEWSKI. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN, MADISON. The DNA-DNA hybridization method of Sibley and Ahlquist was employed to generate over 1200 pairwise comparisons among species of the avian family Gruidae. These genetic distance data, analyzed using a best-fit tree approach and checked for consistency by jacknifing, support the traditional view that Crowned Cranes (Balearica) are the most ancient lineage of extant gruids. The enigmatic Siberian Crane (Grus leucogeranus) appears as the sister group of the re? maining species, which fall into four closely related groups. The genera Bugeranus and Anthropoides are sister groups; three species of Australasian Grus (antigone, rubicunda, and vipio) form an unresolvable cluster, as do five palearctic Grus (grus, monachus, americana, nigricollis, and japonensis). The Sandhill Crane (G. canadensis), while clearly a member of the clade containing the latter three groups, is an isolated lineage without a close relative. 905 SIMPLE ALLOMETRY COEFFICIENTS: FACT OR FICTION. Gene H. Albrecht. University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA. Simple alloraetry (Y-bX^) is the foun? dation of scaiing work (here, regressions are calculated using raw data without the usual log transformation). Most studies make biological interpretations of allo? metric coefficients k or use them to com? pare populations. However, simple allora? etry requires the regression line to pass through the origin (Y=0 when X=0). This assumption is seldom tested because scai? ing data rarely include zero values (in ontogeny, organs first appear at finite body size; in phylogeny, animals smaller than the smallest known are imaginary). An alternative allowing a Y-intercept a is Y=a+bX^ (equals simple alloraetry when a=0). Reanalysis of some classic problems (brains, horns, teeth, metabolism, etc.) gives k's that differ significantly from simple allometry. Also, curvilinearity iraplied by simple allometry (when kfl) may be fictious if observed data are lin? ear (Y=a+bX with k=l) but the regression must curve at smaller values to reach the origin. Thus, many simple alloraetry co? efficients k in the voluminous scaiing literature are artifacts of an analytic model that is implicitly constrained by the biologically unlikely extrapolation of regressions through the origin.</page><page sequence="173">Abstracts 173A 906 HORN LENGTH VS SKULL LENGTH ALLOMETRY IN TITANOTHERES (BRONTOTHERIIDAE : PERISSO- DACTYLA). Gerald S. Bales. University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA. Dog-sized Early Eocene titanotheres evolved to rhinoceras-size before an Ear? ly Oligocene extinction. Nasal horn rudi- ments (&lt;10mm) appeared on tapir-sized Middle Eocene forms and then scaled with skull size to greater relative lengths in Oligocene forms (to 433mra), an allometric increase that has been termed "striking". Two previous studies on horn vs. skull length using simple allometry (Y=bX ) re? sulted in extreme coefficients (k) of about 9.0 and 5.0. However, simple allo? metry implies positive horn length for all skull lengths, both converging to (0,0). This is contradicted by hornless Eocene skulls ranging to 300mm. These skulls, previously ignored, are valid data points on the abscissa suggesting an alternative model (Y=a+bX ) with a non- zero Y-intercept (a). When applied to published measurements including hornless skulls, non-linear iterative regression resulted in a coefficient (k) of 2.5. This implies that titanothere horn evolu? tion was less striking than previously supposed. Generally, model choice greatly effects allometric coefficients and must be carefully made based on biological considerations rather than previous use. 907 IS HETEROCHRONY TESTABLE? IVJ. Irish, American Museum of Natural History, New York, NY. Heterochrony (a phylogenetic change in the relative timing of developmental events) has been proposed as an important mechanism of evolutionary change. In order to detect heterochrony, the ontogenetic sequence of character state change for each taxon must be mapped onto a phylogenetic tree. By definition, hypotheses invoking heterochrony make inferences about ancestor-descendant changes in timing. However, for extant taxa with a poor fossil record, a phylogenetic tree does not contain actual ancestors, but only hypothetical ones defined by character states inferred from the distribution of characters on the tree as a whole. Inferred ancestral states may be affected by minor changes in the data set (e.g., the addition of taxa) that do not affect tree topography as a whole. Further, for a given character, the inferred ancestral state (and thus the inferred ancestral ontogeny) may be equivocal (i.e., more than one character state may be equally parsimonious). Examination of bolyeriid snakes indicates that because of the ambiguity of ancestral character states, it may be impossible to conclude whether or not heterochrony has occurred. 908 THE ANATOMICAL BASIS OF CRANIAL KINESIS IN THE NILE MONITOR. K. Condon. University of Texas, Austin. The skulls of most lizards are thought to possess two kinetic joint systems (metakinetic and mesokinetic) which serve to elevate and depress the upper jaw. Such forms are thus classified as amphikinetic. Frazzetta's (1962; J. Morphology 111: 287) mechanical analysis of amphikinesis specifies the nature of movement at each of the intracranial joints. Based on these mechanical requirements, predicted joint morphologies are derived and compared to actual joint morphologies in the Nile monitor, Varanus niloticus. The metakinetic system requires rotation of the maxillary segment (all of the skull except the ossified braincase) about the occipital metakinetic axis with compensatory sliding at the metakinetic and basipterygoid joints. In the Nile monitor the ascending process of the supraoccipital is rigidly connected to the parietal thus prevenung translation at the metakinetic joint The mesokinetic system requires rotation at the mesokinetic, hypokinetic, quadratopterygoid and dorsal quadrate joints as well as anteroposterior translation at the basipterygoid joint. The mesokinetic joint is a modified sutural joint permitting the required rotation. The hypokinetic joint combines rotation between die pterygoid- ectopterygoid with bending betweeen the pterygoid- palantine. The quadratopterygoid is a modified sutural joint with a stout syndesmosis linking the two bony elements. The dorsal quadrate pivots about its sutural contact with the supratemporal and slides past the intercalary/opisthotic at a synovial joint. The orientation of the synovial basipterygoid joint is primarily anteroposterior. Thus die structure of die intracranial joints of the Nile monitor are consistent with the mechanical requirements of mesokinesis but not metakinesis. 909 ONTOGENETIC SHIFTS IN THE FEEDING MECHANICS OF THE RED-SIDED GARTER SNAKE. B.A. YOUNG. Univ. of Calgary, Alberta. Three separate projects (allometric and kinematic studies, and the development of a muscle model) on the feeding system will be introduced. Allometric analysis revealed character suites showing differential growth rates. From this it was hypothesized that the palato-maxillary component remains functionally stable during ontogeny whereas the mandibular component undergoes a shift towards increased force output. A kinematic study of the strike provided data on the linear and angular displacements of the skeletal elements. By combining these two studies, the structure and movements of the system could be described quantitatively. The hypothesis was tested using a muscle model that produced relative forces and torques. A statistical test permitted the acceptance of the hypothesis. Thus this study provides evidence that during ontogeny there is functional stasis in the palato-maxillary component and a distinct functional shift in the mandibular component.</page><page sequence="174">174A American Society of Zoologists 910 SUCKLING MECHANISM IN INFANT PIGS. R.Z. German. A.W. Croropton. L. Levfteh. and T. Rouse*. Washington Univ., St. Louis, MO. and Harvard Univ., Cambridge, MA. Suckling is the form of feeding unique to infant mammals. Suckling behavior was recorded in infant miniature pigs using cine-x- ray film (100 fps). The pigs had radiopaque markers inserted into the tongue, and drank milk containing barium from a bottle fitted with a special pig nipple. During suckling, the tongue tip wrapped around the nipple, and the tongue body formed two seals: an anterior seal with the hard palate and a posterior seal with the soft palate. Milk was transported in two steps, each of which used pumping action of the tongue to create suction. First, the middle tongue moved strongly downwards and the contact at the posterior seal moved backwards, creating a space between the middle tongue and hard palate. Negative pressure pulled milk from the nipple through a small gap at the anterior seal into this space. Next, the anterior seal reformed immediately posterior to the nipple and the midtongue began to rise. The posterior tongue moved anterior and ventral, creating a space posterior to the fauces into which the milk flowed. In the next cycle the aliquot was pushed out of the valleculae, into the piriform recesses and swallowed. The tongue movements responsible for transport reflect a traveling wave moving posteriorly on the surface of the tongue. The timing of the wave can be quantified by measuring the time lag between movements of the radiopaque tongue markers. 911 ALLOMETRY OF THE MANDIBULAR CORPUS AND SYMPHYSIS IN PROSIMIAN PRIMATES. M.J. Ravosa. Northwestern University. The biomechanical bases for struc? tural variation in the anthropold mandibular symphysis and corpus is well~documented. While experimental data exists for prosimians, the sca? ling of mandibular dimensions is as yet unknown. This is important for a fuller understanding of functional/ dietary factors incumbent to the anthropold transition, inferrlng stress-strain patterns in the prosi- mian lower jaw, and reconstructing the masticatory 'environment* of pro? simians with partial or complete symphyseal fusion. Log-linear regression was applied to adult prosimians from all extant species and several subfossil lemurs, as well as a representative group of anthropoids. As evidenced by rela? tively smaller mandibular dimensions, prosimians likely experience less axial twisting and sagittal bending of the corpus, Within prosimians} no relationship exists between diet and corpus/symphyseal proportions, except for living/fossil indriids (the most folivorous group). This is correla? ted with a short face, higher jaw joint and greater symphyseal fusion. 912 CHEWING FREQUENCY SCALES WITH BODY WEIGHT IN MAMMALS. R.E. Druzinsky. Uhiv. of Illinois, Oiicago. Masticatory cycle times for 17 species of mammals were regressed against body weic^it. A significant, positive correlation was found: CYCLE TTME = 2.189 (BODY WT)0'101 (p = 0.012, r == 0.596) with cycle time in milliseconds and body weic^it in grams. McMahon (1975) argued that single joint and multiple joint mechanical systems have "natural frequencies" of oscillation. Using his "elastic similarity" model of scaiing (McMahon, 1973), McMahon predicted that stride frequencies are proportional to (BODY WT)^V8. He compared animals running at the trot-gallop transition and found that: STRIDE FREQ ? (BODY WT)"0-14 similar to the value of -1/8 predicted. Rates of chewing in mammals were tested against McMahon*s prediction. It was found that: OfEW FREQ = 2.589 (BODY WT)"0'101 with chewing frequency in cycles/minute and body weight in kilograms. This result is reasonably close to the predicted -1/8 exponent, and supports the hypothesis that there are natural frequencies of oscillation in mammalian jaw mechanisms.

Skull, joint and muscle anatomy was combined with quantified movement and electromyographical data to study jaw me? chanics of freely feeding Pteropids. Es? timates of the forces that act apon the mandible during a chewing cycle, and sub? sequent estimates of reaction forces at different bite points and joints during the powerstroke, were obtained for diffe? rent food consistencies. The resultant muscular force shifts from upward and slightly backward at large gapes to up? ward and markedly backward at the end of closing. The resultant simultaneously mo? ves anteriorly. During the powerstroke it retains a constant position and orienta? tion along the anterior edge of the coro- noid process. Early stages of opening are guided by the slope of teeth and mandibu? lar fossa; during the remaining part of opening the working line of the resultant crosses the skull behind the joint and acquires an opening moment. Bite force has vertical and forward components, and a slight transverse component. Its magni? tude increases as the bite point is moved posteriorly, its direction is merely a function of masseter activity. Both con- dyles are loaded, the contralateral one more than the ipsilateral.</page><page sequence="175">Abstracts 175A 914 MORPHOLOGY AND FUNCTION OF THE JAW APPARATUS IN TWO ARMADILLOS. K.K. Smith and K.H. Redford*. Duke University, Durham, and Univ. of Florida, Gainesville. The morphology and function of the masticatory apparatus in two armadillos, Dasypus novemcinctus and Euphractus sexcinctus is compared. Euphractus. restricted to South America is an omnivore, eating a wide range of foods including carrion. Dasypus is insectivorous-omnivorous, apparently eating what? ever it encounters in the leaf litter. In South America this leads to a primarily myrmecophageous diet; in North America, the diet is considerably broadened. The masticatory apparatus in Euphractus is massive. The teeth, jaws and musculature are large and the configuration of the jaws maximizes force production. Dasypus possesses many of the characteristics of ant and termite-eating mammals, including reduced jaw musculature. In Dasypus the total jaw musculature weighs only 26% more than the nasal musculature. Cineradiographic films indicate that the two animals are also different in jaw movement profile and speed of jaw cycle. The specializations for myrmecophagy in Dasypus do not, however, constrain its diet. As this animal has expanded its range into North America, its diet has become more broadly omnivorous. This observation highlights the difficulties in predicting diet from morphological analysis and raises questions about the behavioral limits imposed by morphological specialization. 915 STRUCTURE OF THE CARNIVORAN MANDIBLE AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO KILLING AND FEEDING BEHAVIORS. A.R. Biknevicius and CB. Ruff. The Johns Hopkins Univ., Baltimore. Assuming some optimization of bone structure to applied mechanical loadings in vivo, differential killing and feeding behaviors in hyaenids, felids, and canids should be reflected in differences in mandibular shape. Using beam theory, we estimated and compared bending strengths of corpora about the sagittal and transverse axes at the P3P4 and P4M1 interdental gaps. The corpus was first modelled as a solid beam u*sing external diameters to compute bending strengths. Hyaenid corpora are designed to withstand large sagittal bending moments, particularly distal to the premolars with which they crush bone. The corpora of felids are buttressed against both sagittal and transverse bending moments due to canine holds on struggling prey. Finally, canids have elongate and slender mandibles associated with rapid adduction of the mandible and relatively low stress killing and ingestive behaviors. The corpus was also modelled as a hollow beam with cortical bone thickness measured using sagittal and transverse radiographs. Our preliminary results are in agreement with the solid beam model. 916 DENTAL MICROWEAR AND DIETARY DIFFERENCES IN LIVING AND FOSSIL CARNIVORES. B. Van Valkenburgh. Univ. of California, Los Angeles. Dental microwear patterns provide direct evidence of tooth use and diet in living and extinct species, and thus can supplement inferences based on morphology. The correspondence between dietary habits and microscopic tooth wear, as visualized by the scanning electron microscope, is explored in a number of large carnivores. Species examined include cheetah, leopard, lion, wild dog, wolf, jackal, spotted and striped hyaenas. Several of these differ primarily in the relative proportions of meat versus bone in their diets. For example, cheetahs consume less bone than do leopards and lions, both of which consume less than hyaenas. The frequency and shape of microwear features of the buccal surface of the lower Ml are quantified and compared among taxa. Correlations between diet and microwear are then used to assess the feeding behavior of the Rancholabrean sabertooth cat, Smilodon fatalis and dire wolf, Canis dlrus. 917 STRAIN PATTERNS IN CRANIAL BONES AND SUTURES DURING IMPACT LOADING. C.R. Jaslow and A.A. Biewener. Rhodes College, Memphis, TN, and The Univ. of Chicago, IL. Principal strains were measured in vitro from the cranial bones, sutures, and horns of female domestic goats (Capra hircus) during impact loading on one vs. both horns. The objectives were to characterize the patterns of stress in a Caprine skull that may be associated with combative behavior, and to determine how cranial sutures may affect the transmission of stress in the skull. During symmetric loading of both horns, the two frontal bones and the parietal bone experienced approximately equal peak compressive strains (about -1000 u?). Single-horn blows tended to rotate the head, dissipating the peak impact force imparted to the horn and producing relatively lower strain values. In almost all cases, strain magnitudes in the bones diminished across sutures, with strains measured over the sutures being much higher than in the adjacent bones. This kinetic property of the sutures may contibute significantly to dissipating the stresses that are transmitted through the skull during an impact blow.</page><page sequence="176">176A American Society of Zoologists 918 TOXICITY TESTS WITH GIANT KELP MACROCYSTIS PYRIFERA. B.S. Anderson and J.W Hunt. University of California, Santa Cruz. A new generation of laboratory toxicity tests are being developed to monitor the toxicity of sewage effluents being discharged into coastal marine waters. The tests use species representing a variety of phyla, including the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, a species of considerable ecological and economic importance. A short-term bioassay test has been developed for testing the toxicity of pollutants to the zoospore and early gametophytic stages of kelp. The test has advantages in that it requires no special lighting or nutrients, and the relatively short time-span minimizes contamination by competing organisms. Spores obtained from reproductive blades are exposed while motile. After a 48-h exposure period the developing gametophytes are observed microscopically. Two endpoints are being evaluated: inhibition of growth of spore germination tubes, and reduction of spore germination rates. Preliminary tests indicate that this alga is relatively sensitive to organic and inorganic toxicants and sewage effluents. The germ-tube endpoint was less variable and more sensitive than the germination rate endpoint in muliple tests with zinc sulfate and copper chloride. The No Observed Effect Concentrations (NOECs) for inhibition of germ-tube growth in zinc and copper were &lt; 550 + 25 u,g L"1, and &lt; 56 jig L-1, respectively. The NOECs for germination reduction in zinc and copper were 3000 ? 2100 ug L_1 and &lt; 56 u\g L"1, respectively. The sensitivity of the short-term, 48-h test endpoints were evaluated by comparison to a long-term, 16-day test which focuses on sporophyte production. The long-term sporophyte production endpoint was more sensitive than the short-term germination endpoint, but less sensitive than the germ-tube length endpoint 919 POLYPLOIDY IN MACROCYSTIS AND MACROCYSTIS-PELAGOPHYCUS HYBRIDS Raymond J. Lewis, University of California, Santa Barbara. Macrocystis integrifolia has been reported to have a chromosome number of n = 16, 2n = 32. There have been two recently published reports of twice that number of chromosomes in M. angustifolia and M^ integrifolia. Female and male gametophytes of M^_ integrifolia have been found to have n = 32 chromosomes. These gametophytes have been crossed previously with &gt;L_ pyrifera gametophytes producing interspecific hybrids. These hybrids produced gametophytes which have n = 16 chromosomes, as do the M. pyrifera parents. The elk kelp, Pelagophycus porra has n = 16 chromosomes. A natural Macrocystis-Pelagophycus hybrid was found which produced spores. Gametophytes from these spores have 32 chromosomes. It is hypothesized that these represent 16 from Macrocystis and 16 from Pelagophycus, which is consistent with what would be expected if the parents of this hybrid were both polyploids. 920 SEASONAL CHANGES IN THE PRODUCTION AND RELEASE OF 200SP0RES BY THE GIANT KELP, MACROCYSTISPYRIFERA. Gven A. Telleoen*. and. James N. Kremer. Department of Biology, Univ of Southern California, Los Angeles. Recent studies ofthe physical factors affecting Macrocustis purifera recruitment have focused on the gametophyte and sporophyte life phases. Little vork has looked at seasonal changes in zoospore production and release. As a result, assumptions of constant, year-round spore release are often made and utilized. I n a combi ned laboratory and field study, actual rates of zoos pore release vere observed through all seasons in two years. Lab work showed that spore release from cores was greatly enhanced by exposure to 5-1O^C water for 4-6 hrs. From this, it was hypothesized that short-term thermal shocking events may stimulate spore release. In nature, daily changes in temp. can be caused by tidal shifts of the thermocline. This would result in greater spore release at times of a well developed thermocline, such as summer and fall. To test this, temperatures were monitored within a kelp forest, and sporophylls were bagged for 24 hours to look at daily, injitu spore release. Preliminary analysis has shown a very strong correlation between the daily temperature range experienced by kelp sporophylls and the release rate (r=0.9). The results of this study indicate that zoos pore production is not constant throughout the annual cycle, with peaks in production and release in the late summer and fall. 921 TEMPORAL VARIABILITY IN GROWTH OF GIANT KELP IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. J.M. Watan- abe, R.E. Phillips. and P.C. Barnett*. Monterey Bay Aquarium, Monterey, CA. Monthly estimates of surface canopy cover and elongation rates of subsurface fronds of Macrocystis pyrifera were fol? lowed in a 4200 m area in the Hopkins Marine Life Refuge (Pacific Grove, CA) between January 1985 and the present. Temperature &amp; inorganic nutrients were monitored directly and subtidal light estimated from continuous r-ecords of above-water broad band irradiance. Surface canopy cover showed cyclical trends but the degree of reduetion and seasonal timing varied. Maximum cover was &gt;90% and occurred in January, August, June and May during the 3 years of study. Minimum canopy cover occurred in May, January, and October, with values of 10, 55 and 17%. Elongation rates of subsurface fronds varied be? tween 2.7 &amp; 6.2% per day. Growth rates were not correlated with surface canopy cover, temperature or total nitrogen alone. Subsurface light accounted for 44% of the variability in growth (p&lt; .001). Our data indicate that subsurface growth rate of giant kelp in central California was influenced primarily by light levels; nitrogen limitation probably occurred only rarely, if ever.</page><page sequence="177">Abstracts 177A 922 THE LIFE HISTORY OF ENDARACHNE BINGHAMIAE (PHAEOPHYTA) FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: FIELD AND LABORATORY STUDIES. T.C. Brophy and S.N. Murrav*. California State University, Fullerton. Erect, bladed macrothalli of a southern California population of Endarachne binghamiae were abundant in the fall through spring and almost entirely absent in the summer. Field abundances of blades were negatively correlated with seawater temperature and photoperiod. Laboratory studies confirmed the existence of an apparent nonsexual, direct life-history. Zooids, which are produced from bladed macrothalli throughout the year, developed under spring/fall (17? C) and winter (13?C) temperatures into crusts that gave rise to erect blades over the range of natural photoperiods (10:14, 12:12, 14:10 h LD). In contrast, under summer temperatures (21? C) almost entirely crustose thalli were produced regardless of photoperiod, indicating that the intiation of new blades is temperature- controlled. The summer decline of Endarachne binghamiae blades appears to be due to increased mortality rates and temperature constraints on the development of new bladed thalli. 923 EFFECTS OF AMBIENT UV RADIATION ON PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY IN PHYTOPLANKTON. T. Hazzard*, R.A. Kinzie III and S. Taguchi*. Univ. Hawaii, Honolulu. Natural assemblages of phytoplankton, as well as monospecific cultures were incubated in quartz and standard soda- lime BOD bottles along with dark controls. Experiments took place in Kaneohe Bay Hawaii 21 26'N. Relative UV levels were determined using a chemical actinometer. Primary productivity was measured using both Winkler 0? titrations and -^C fixa? tion methods. In moderately clear inshore tropical waters ambient levels of UV radiation inhibit primary producti? vity as determined by both 0? production and 14C fixation. The extent of UV inhibition on production is dependent on water quality and so no simple relation? ship between depth and inhibition level can be formulated. Workers using stand? ard BOD bottles should be aware of the potential effects on measurements of primary production. 944 MODULATION OF CHEMORESPONSIVENESS OF MARINE CRUSTACEANS. P.C Daniel. C?D. Derbv. and J. B. Fine- Levv*. Georgia State University, Atlanta. Marine crustaceans glean information about their environment predominantly through their chemical senses. The meaning of these cues varies as a function of changes in internal and external conditions. Lobsters can modulate responses to chemical signals whose meanings have been altered through conditioning techniques. A decrease in the responsiveness of Florida spiny lobsters towards the food odor to which they were conditioned occurred after aversive conditioning or after habituation. Conversely, an increase in responsiveness of American lobsters to prey odors occurred after ingestive conditioning to that prey. These results can be interpreted from an optimal foraging perspective: the modification of the level of chemoresponsiveness expresses changes in the predator's perceptions of the value of the prey as food. 945 CHEMOSIGNALS AND PUBERTY IN HOUSE MICE: MIXING URINE TREATMENTS IN UNEQUAL PROPORTIONS. Lee O Drickamer. Southern Illinois Univ., Carbondale. Urine from male mice, female mice in estrus, and female mice that are pregnant or lactating accelerate the onset of first estrus in young females, whereas urine from grouped females delays first estrus. Treatment with combinations of these urine types used in equal proportions results in puberty delays when one of the urine types is grouped females and puberty acceleration when other combinations are tested. Free-living house mice would be expected to encounter a variety of urine types in varying proportions. The present experiments tested the effects of combining urine from different sources in unequal proportions. At ratios of 10-20 parts acceleratory urine to 1 part delay urine, the acceleratory effect overrides the delay signal. Ratios of 4-to-1 up to 7-to-l of acceleratory urine to delay urine result in ages for puberty that are neither accelerated nor delayed, but vary depending upon which urine sources are used. Further tests demonstrate that over a modest range of actual dose amounts of urine, these effects are true regardless of the actual quantities of urine employed in treating test females. Physiological effects appear to be the result of summation of excitatory and inhibitory influences from the urinary signals. Female mice are more sensitive to the delay chemosignal.</page><page sequence="178">178A American Society of Zoologists 946 THE ALLOMETRY OF ACOUSTIC COMMUNICATION IN ACRIS CREPITANS. W. Wilczynski and M. J. Ryan. Univ. of Texas, Austin. Among populations of cricket frogs, the dominant frequency of the male adver- tisement call varies, as does the best excitatory frequency (BEF) of the basilar papilla (BP), the inner ear organ whose tuning matches the call frequency (Ryan &amp; Wilczynski, Science, 1988, 240: 1786). We examined the variation in both call frequency and BP tuning within a single population of frogs near Bastrop, TX, and related both to body size variation. The mean call dominant frequency in this pop? ulation is 3882 Hz and varies with body size such that r= -0.387. BP tuning dif- fers between males and females; mean BEFs are 4035 and 3763 Hz respectively (t= 3.62, p&lt;.05). In both sexes tuning cor? relates negatively with body size (re- gressed against head width male r= -0.567 female r= -0.511). Females are larger than males (t=2.23, p&lt;.05) which accounts for part of the sex difference in tuning. The fact that the mean call frequency lies between the mean BEFs of males and females suggests that both sexes would be equally sensitive to the call despite the sex difference in tuning.

Wilczynski, Univ. of Texas, Austin. Female Physalaemus pustulosus are more likely to mate with larger males because they prefer male advertisement calls in which one component, the "chuck", has a lower fundamental frequency. The chuck has an average fundamental frequency of 250 Hz and contains ca. 12 harmonics. As male size increases, both the fundamental frequency and the frequency distance be? tween harmonics decrease. Ryan (The Tun- gara Frog, 1985) suggested that females prefer low frequency chucks because the closer harmonics pack more energy into the frequency window of the high frequen? cy inner ear auditory organ, the basilar papilla (BP). Multiunit midbrain record- ings show the BP to be a V-shaped filter tuned to 2.2 kHz. It therefore lies in the middle of the chuck1s upper harmonics. Using the characteristics of the physio? logically determined audiogram, computer simulations of neural activity evoked by chucks with different fundamental fre? quencies were performed. The simulations show that decreasing the chuck1s frequen? cy does increase BP stimulation, thus supporting Ryan's (1985) hypothesis. (Supported by NSF grant BNS 8606289.) 948 FACULTATIVE ALTERATION OF A SIGNAL USED FOR ASSESSMENT OF FIGHTING ABILITY: BLUFFING IN CRICKET FROGS? W. E. Wagner Jr. University of Texas at Austin. Fighting and assessment theory predicts that signals used for assessment of competitor fighting ability should reliably convey information about fighting ability. Observational and experimental data on fighting and assessment in Blanchard's cricket frog, Acris crepitans blanchardi. however, suggest the possibility of bluffing of a cue used for assessment of fighting ability. Larger males win wrestling contests over calling sites, and the dominant frequency of the call is negatively correlated with male size. Males can therefore potentially assess the size of competitors based on the dominant frequency of the call. Males abandon calling in response to playbacks of low frequency calls (simulating a large male) and attack in response to playbacks of high frequency calls (simulating a small male). Males thus appear to actually use dominant frequency for assessment of competitor size. However, in encounters with larger opponents, but not in encounters with smaller opponents, males actively lower the frequency of their calls. Furthermore, preliminary data suggest that this frequency alteration is functionally important during contests, allowing males to win more encounters over calling sites than if they did not lower their frequency. Sexual selection by male competition appears to have resulted in the evolution of facultative frequency alteration, potentially as a mechanism to deceive receivers about a signaller's fighting ability. 949 INDIVIDUAL VARIATION IN AGGRESSION AND LEARNING PERFORMANCE IN CYPRINODON VARIEGA1US. A. Beuliq and K. Mathews. New College of USF, Sarasota, FI. Individual levels of aggressiveness in newly-captured, sexually mature male pupfish Cyprinodon varieqatus were de? termined in round-robin paired encounter tournaments. Each of twenty subjects was scored on the basis of frequency of ag? gressive acts and outcomes of 10-min encounters with all other fish and assigned an "aggression score". After completion of tests subjects were isolated for two months and a second round of tournaments was held. Then each subject was exposed to a two-way active avoidance task and the number of days to 90% avoidance as well as total number of avoidances were scored. Pre? liminary analysis suggests a positive relationship between aggressiveness and learning performance.</page><page sequence="179">Abstracts 179A 950 BEHAVIORAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN BURROWING SHRIMP: EFFECTS ON DISTRIBUTION OF SYMPATRIC THALASSINIDS.

Most individuals exhib? ited agonistlc behaviors upon en- countering another individual. Callianassa gigas with its longer chelae is clearly the behaviorally dominant species that gains space from other species by acts of agg? ression, Upogebia macglnitleorum is the most aggressive species, yet it loses burrow space because its behavioral tactics do not deter the callianasslds. The effects of size and sex in inter and intra? specific interactions provide insight into the dynamics of the thalassinid community and suggest that behavioral interactions are determinants of species distribut? ions. 951 SIBLING RECOGNITION BY BLACK SURFPERCH, EMBIOTOCA JACKSONI. P.C. Sikkel and C.A. Fuller. Oregon State Univ., Corvallis. Grouping may confer several benefits upon group members,such as a lower preda? tion risk and increased foraging efficien? cy. If groups are composed of related in? dividuals, these benefits will be compound- ed by contributing to the inclusive fit? ness of members. Consequently, selection may favor preferential association with related individuals. In order to form and maintein kin groups, individuals must be able to distinguish between related and unrelated conspecifics. Juvenile black surfperch form groups of 2-10 similar- sized individuals in the field. These group sizes correspond closely with female brood sizes,suggesting that they may be composed of siblings. Newborn black surf? perch, obtained from wild-caught females, were reared in sib groups for 1-4 weeks. When presented with stimulus fish on either side of a partitioned aquarium, test fish spent a significantly greater proportion of the 5 min. test period near sibs than near age-matched non-sibs. This demon- strates that these fish are able to diff- erentiate between familiar sibs and unfa? miliar non-sibs, providing a mechanism for the maintenance of kin groups. 952 INFLUENCE OF GROUND EFFECT DURING FLAP- PING FLIGHT. de la Cueva Salcedo, H. and R.W. Blake. University of British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C, Canada. Flight strategies of animals are interpreted as mini? mizing energy cost. Such strategies during flapping flight can be divided into active (e.g. flap and glide, wind hov- ering) or passive (e.g. formation flight and ground effect GE). Flight in GE reduces induced drag and increases lift. GE is a function of the wingspan size and its height above the water. Assesment of GE in flapping flight requires knowledge of the positions of the wing during the wing beat cycle. Through-high speed cinematography, digiti- zation of the wingtip movements, and best fit algorithms the movement of the wing tip is described as a Fourier series. The vertical displacement of the wing during the downstroke is described as a pendulum hinged at the wing base oscillating normally to the direction of flight. GE during flapping flight is a function of the change in height through the downstroke phase of the flapping cycle of the different segments of the wing from its root to its tip and the change in height through time during the flapping cy? cle. It is assesed with standard fixed winged ground effect equations. The influence of GE in the bird's aerodynamic power curve, cost of transport, and cargo capabilites is assesed and discussed for different bird species. Compar? isons across species and scaling effects on performance un? der GE are considered. Four bird species: double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus), brown pelicans (Pele- canus occidenialis), black skimmers (Rynchops niger), and barns swallows (Hirundo rustica) are taken as examples of birds using GE during flapping flight. These birds employ different flight and feeding strategies in which GE plays an important role in food acquisition and transport. 953 MATING CALL DOMINANT FREQUENCY AND EAR MORPHOLOGY IN TWO POPULATIONS OF ACRIS CREPITANS. B.E. McClelland, W. Wilczvnski and M.J. Ryan. University of Texas, Austin. Previous studies suggest that the cricket frog ear is tuned to the characteristics of the species' mating call (Ryan &amp; Wilczynski, Sci. (1988) 240; 1786). We compared the body sizes and anatomical components of the auditory system with call dominant frequency in individuals representing two populations from Sabine (SA) and Lake Balmorhea (BA), Texas. The dominant frequencies are lower (BA=2.78; SA=4.03 kHz), but the head widths (BA=.91; SA=.79 cm), snout-vent lengths (SVL) (BA=2.86; SA=2.34 cm), middle ear (BA=.466; SA=.303), inner ear (BA=1.50; SA=1.18) and extracolumella (BA=.027; SA^.019) are all larger in the BA population (ear measurements in mm3; all p&lt;.01; Student's t-test). The mean tympanum diameters (1.1 mm) are the same for both populations and may represent a functional size limit. However, the different extracolumellar cartilage volume may differentially affect the resonance properties of the tympanum and with the other differences in the ear, provide a better "match" to the mating call dominant frequency.

A.Kontos and S.Eckert/ Univ. of Ga./ Athens. Six turtles were identified/ noting distinctive morphology/ utlizing a coral reef area off Mona Is./ P.R. No. of breaths/ surface time/ and dive time were defined and measured. Adult turtles spent 5% of their time on the surface and the mean no. of breaths was 5.85 per epi? sode.

No corr? elation was found between the no. of breaths and surface time suggesting that the variation of time on the surface may be due to some other physiological pat? tern. A positive correlation was found between the no. of breaths and dive time possibly reflecting the activity level of the turtie during the preceeding dive. No correlation was found between the sur? face time and diving time further sugges? ting that surface time may be due to some other physiological pattern. The no. of times a turtie surfaced and dove increased between 1100-1530 EST suggesting that this turtie's activity level increases during these hours. Ack: W.K.

University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. The cladogram produced by phylogenetic systematic analysis of the Gasterosteidae based solely upon behavioural characters is congruent with trees based upon morphological and electrophoretic data. Behaviour, like other aspects of an organism's phenotype, contains information of phylogentic relationships. Cur? rent behavioural patterns are therefore an interaction of past (historical constraints) and present (environmental selection). Studies of the evolutionary significance of a character should take both factors into account to avoid confusing character maintenance (homeostasis) with char? acter origin and diversification (evolution). When ecological, behavioural, morphological and geographical data are combined in a phylo? genetic framework, a robust characterization of evolutionary history is produced. The macro? evolutionary examination of patterns and relationships among characters, in turn, provides a framework of predictions for micro- evolutionary (within species) experimental examination.

Rutgers Univ., New Brunswick, N.J. Wingbeat frequencies (a) and thoracic temperatures (Tth) of 13 species of free flying beetles ranging from 3 mg to 200 mg in body mass were measured at different ambient air temperatures (Ta). Beetles with higher mean a were found to have greater thermoregulatory capacities. The effect of Tth on n. varied greatly among different species. Q 10's ranged from 1.0 to 1.4 and were independent of taxonomic affinity and morphological parameters (wing area, length, and mass, and body length and mass). However, a strong correlation with the average a was observed. Therefore, it can be hypothesized, that beetles with high a thermoregulate to minimize effects of Tth on a- Because of the variable and low Q 10 values, the effect of Tth on a is unlikely to be a result of muscle temperature dependence. Additionally, a lack of correlation with morphological parameters eliminated these as causal agents. As a consequence, these data suggest that the observed changes in frequency are a result of changes in the resonance properties of the thorax. 957 SEXUAL MATURITY-DEPENDENT NEURAL PLASTICI? TY IN THE PREPACEMAKER NUCLEUS OF ADULT WEAKLY ELECTRIC KNIFEFISH. G.K.H. Zupanc and W. Heiliqenberg*. Univ. of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA. Knifefish of the genus Eigentnannia (Gymnotiformes, Teleostei) are seasonal breeders, spawning only during the tropical rainy season. They modulate their constant wave-like electric organ dis- charges in the context of courtship and aggressive behavior by 'chirps', extremely rapid rises in instantaneous frequency. The production of chirps is controlled by the diencephalic prepacemaker nucleus, PPn (KAWASAKI et al., 1988). By retrograde HRP labelling, we studied the dependence of the PPn's morphology upon sexual maturity. The most prominent effect was that, during the breeding season, females developed an abundance of dendritic swellings ('vari? cosities'). Mature females had signifi? cantly more varicosities than immature females. After the onset of the dry sea? son, relative gonadal weight as well as the number and the diameter of varicosit? ies was reduced in females and in males. Varicosities may represent growing buds, or regions of synaptic contact, or both. Such dynamic changes in the structure of neurons might subserve seasonal modifi? cations in an animal's propensity to execute specific behaviors.</page><page sequence="181">Abstracts 181A 958 TESTOSTERONE AND AGGRESSION IN CYPRINODON VARIEGATUS. M. Dwver* and A. Beulig. New College, Sarasota, FI. The effects of testosterone and social experience on development of aggressive behavior in Cypri? nodon variegatus were investigated. Social exper? ience was defined as visual, tactile, chemosensory, and auditory contact with conspecifics. Behavior of Cyprinodon was monitored from 3 weeks to 4 months of age under 3 levels of social experience: isolated subjects, groups of 4, and groups of 16. There were 2 replicates of each treatment level. At 3 months of age, one replicate of the social con? ditions received a subcutaneous injection of tes? tosterone and the other replicate received an injec? tion of dH20. Behaviors were videotaped and an ethogram was constructed using the focal animal method. A round robin paired encounter tourna- ment was performed 2 weeks before the injections and 1 month after the injections. Preliminary analysis of the ethogram showed the means and standard deviations of the frequencies and dura? tions for all the behaviors were similar among all treatment levels. There was a significant dif? ference in the outcomes of the paired encounter tests for all treatment levels. 959 HEMIPENIS USE IN THE LIZARD, ANOLIS SAGREI: EFFECTS OF UNILATERAL CASTRATION. R. R. Tokarz. Univ. Miami, Coral Gables, FT- Male /\. sagrei show a significant pattern of alternation in the use of their two independent copulatory organs, the hemipenes. This study, by comparing hemipenis use in left and in right unilaterally castrated males to sham- treated males, tested the hypothesis that sensory feedback from the testis or sperm duct determines this alternat- ing pattern. Two weeks after surgery, males were observed in either two copulations separated by 1-3 hours or in a series of 16 copulations over a period of 16 days. Independently of which testis had been removed, uni? laterally castrated males showed a significant pattern of alternation in the use of the hemipenes and showed no significant difference in the frequency of use of the left or right hemipenis. After the series of 16 copulations, the mass of the sperm ducts leading to a testis was significantly greater than of ducts not leading to a testis. These results suggest that sensory input from either the testis or sperm duct is not an important determinant of the pattern of hemipenis use in male A. sagrei.

The behavioral ecology and population dynamics of the feral goats of Aldabra Atoll, Seychelles, were studied for 20 months between 1976 and 1986. The semi- arid climate and the availability of water influenced the behavior and the timing and rate of reproduction of the goats. The only source of fresh drinking water was rain puddles which the goats used readily. By the end of the six-month dry season, however, most such puddles had disappeared, and goats drank seawater from tidal pools and the lagoon. The goats1 kidneys showed normal gross morphology; relative renal medullary thickness was within the range reported for other feral and domestic goats. The Aldabra goats conserved water by producing relatively dry feces with mean water content of only 36%, by remaining relatively inactive during the hottest part of the day, and by feeding primarily at dusk and dawn when air temperatures were cooler and forage had higher water content and occasional dew. Births occurred year round, but a distinct peak occurred at the beginning of the dry season. Reproductive rates were lower during drier years. 961 ANIMAL RIGHTISTS IGNORE NATURE. W.E. HOWARD, University of California, Davis. There has been an historical shift in people's philosophy about animal wel- fare, but animal rightists ignore the basic laws of nature, which also is mis- understood by many people. Homo sapiens are part of nature and are not going to go away. In environments they have mod? ified, it is a mistake and very inhumane to leave the regulation of the animal populations to lingering deaths from star? vation, disease, cannabalism, and other whims of nature. People should manage and control such artifical populations. Compare the suffering of a. coyote caught in an off-set jaw trap that is humanely disposed of the next day with the suffer? ing such a biologically surplus coyote would have inflicted upon the .large number of helpless prey it had consumed before being trapped. We forget that suffering is a natural phenomenon all animals experience. With few exceptions, wild animals suffer far more from natural deaths than when controlled with guns, traps, or poisons. In nature every organ? ism struggles (survival of the fittest) to reach old age, but the natural scheme of things could not exist if more than a small percentage attained old age.</page><page sequence="182">182A American Society of Zoologists 962 REGULATORS OF MELATONIN SECRETION INTO THE PLASMA OF RAINBOW TROUT. W.A. Gern and J.M. Nervina*. Univ. of Wyoming, Laramie. The role of diel illumination patterns, ocular photoreception and the possibility of endogenous rhythms regulating jLn vivo pineal melatonin (MEL) secretion in rain? bow trout (Salmo gairdneri) was investi? gated using a validated (parallelism, quantitative recovery and chromatograph? ic identity) radioimmunoassay to measure plasma titer. It was determined that plasma MEL secretion displayed a square wave secretion profile with elevated titer (500-800 pg/ml) occurring through? out the scotophase when fish were held in LD. No endogenous rhythm in plasma MEL was observed when fish were maintain? ed in DD, whether acclimated for short (24h) or long (5d) duration in DD. Blinded and sighted trout responded to the onset of darkness and to light pulses during the scotophase in a simi? lar manner. These results demonstrate that direct pineal photoreception is responsible for diel changes in plasma MEL and that unlike amniotic vertebrates, rainbow trout do not display endogenous rhythmicity in pineal melatonin synthe? sis and secretion.

Univ. of Delaware, Newark and *Uniformed Services Univ. for Health Sci., Bethesda. The rat pineal gland is innervated by the sympathetic efferents which regulate pineal melatonin synthesis via p- and a^- adrenoceptors. To determine if pineal melatonin synthesis in Turkish hamsters is mediated by 0-adrenoceptors, animals were injected s.c. with isoproterenol (ISO) at 5 different time points during the dark phase. ISO administered 2 h prior to light onset produced a 6-fold increase in pineal melatonin content 2 h post injec? tion, extending the nocturnal melatonin peak. ISO injection at lights on also increased pineal melatonin levels above the normal low value. ISO injections at other times did not exert any stimulatory effect. Acute (1 d) LL treatment was used to test whether &gt;9-adrenoceptors show supersensitivity to ISO in the absence of endogenous NE. The result showed that LL did not potentiate the stimulatory effect of ISO but rather abolished its effect. These data suggest that pineal /3-adrenoceptors jj} vivo in Turkish hamsters exhibit a rhythm of sensitivity to ISO during the dark and that this responsiveness is totally suppressed by one night of LL treatment. 964 CHARACTERIZATION OF ENKEPHALIN-RELATED PRODUCTS ISOLATED FROM THE CNS OF THE PACIFIC HAGFISH, EPTATRETUS STOUTI. R.M. Pores and A. Gorbman. Univ. of Denver/ Denver; CO, Univ. of Washington/ Seattle, WA. and Univ. of Alberta/ Edmonton/ Canada. Endogenous opiate-related peptides have been detected by immunohistochemicaland by bioassay procedures in the CNS of the pacific hagfish/ however/ the biochemical characterization of these peptides has not been attempted. Acid extracts of the CNS of the hagfish were fractionated by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 column and a peak of enkephalin-sized material was detected with a Met-enkephalin RIA. This peak was further fractionated by reverse phase HPLC and fractions were separately screened with a Met-enkephalin RIA and a Leu-enkephalin RIA. Two peaks of immunoreactivity with the same retention times as synthetic Met-enkephalin and Leu-enkephalin were detected. The molar ratio of Met- to Leu-enkephalin was approximately 3:1. These results would indicate that/ pro-enkephalin/ the common precursor for Met- and Leu-enkephalin appeared early in vertebrate evolution. 965 AN INCREASE IN LEVELS OF CORTICOSTEROIDS SYNTHESIS BY THE ADRENAL GLAND OF THE TURTLE, CHRYSEMYS PICTA AFTER THE AD? MINISTRATION OF CORTROSYN. J. L Plude* and I. Y. Mahmoud. Univ. of Wisconsin, Oshkosh. Cortroysyn (cosyntropin) which is a syn? thetic subunit of ACTH was injected intra- muscularly into two different groups of tur? tles during the egg laying season. Experimental turtles were given an injection of cortrosyn (5ng/g body wt.) and were sacrificed at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 hr.. One group received a second injection after 4 hr. and was sacrificed after 8 hr.. After sacrifice, the adrenal glands were removed and assayed for corticosteroids by HPLC. Steroids increase gradually between 1-8 hr. after the injection and reached a peak after 5 hr.. The group which received the sec? ond injection showed the most significant rise in steroids. This indicates that cortrosyn is an effective agent in enhancing steroidogenesis in the reptilian adrenal gland.

Missbach*, University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh; Medical College of Wisconsin; St. Joseph's Hospital, Milwaukee. A buildup of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was observed over a period of 1-8 hr following the administration of cortrosyn (5ng/g body WT). The ER was most highly developed in turtles which received two injections of cortrosyn, the initial injection followed by another injection after 4 hr. Plasma cortisol increased from 1.12 ng/ml to 1.76 ng/ml within 5 hr. following a single injection. Following two injections, the cortisol reached 2.34 ng/ml. This experiment indicates that cortrosyn, a synthetic subunit of ACTH, is capable of inducing steroidogenesis in this species of turtle. 967 THE EFFECT OF RU486 ON THE ADAPTATION OF THE BROOK TROUT, SALVELINUS FONTINALIS AND THE ATLANTIC SALMON, SALMO SALAR TO SEA WATER. M. Weisbart and F.M. Gottschal 1 . St. Francis Xavier Univ., Antigonish, N.S. RU486 [170-hydroxy-ll&amp;-(4- dimethylaminophenyl)17a-(prop-l- ynyl )estra-4,9-diene-3-one] is a steroid analog which antagonizes glucocorticoid action at the receptor level in mammalian tissues. In gill cytosol preparations from brook trout and Atlantic salmon RU486 readily displaces the natural steroid, cortisol. When Atlantic salmon were injected with RU486 and subsequently transferred to fresh water or sea water, the LD50 was about 24 h in both environments. Vehicle injected salmon survived exposure to fresh water or sea water. Brook trout transferred to sea water after injection with RU486 or vehicle survived up to 72 h post injection. The effect of RU486 on several plasma and tissue parameters is presently under investigation.

In vitro exposure of isolated gill filaments to cortisol (0.25 to 10 ug/mL) for 2 days resulted In a dose-dependent increase in Na+,K+-ATPase activity (40% increase at the highest dose). Insulin (5 ug/mL) did not affect Na+,K+-ATPase activity in vitro, with or without cortisol treatment. In vitro exposure of the isolated opercular membrane to 10 ug/mL cortisol for 4 days resulted in a 2-fold increase in Na+jK*- ATPase activity and a significant change in size and appearance of chloride cells. Thus, cortisol has direct effects on the morphological and biochemical characteristics of the chloride cell.

Murphy? Univ. Connecticut, Storrs and S.U.N.Y., Cobleskill. The yolk sac provides the chick embryo with nutrients, including calcium, during embryogenesis. A major means of transport from yolk to embryo appears to be endocytosis. We have studied the effects of vitamin D or parathyroid hormone (PTH) on the transport of 45Ca in embryos of 9, 12 and 15 days of incubation, 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3, PTH or vehicle was injected into the yolk 48 and 24 hours prior to each experiment. Vitamin D induced hypercalcemia in all ages; PTH induced hypercalcemia only in day 12 and 15 embryos. To study calcium transport, we injected 45Ca into the yolk compartment 48 hours after the start of hormone treatment and determined its appearance in the blood after transport across the yolk sac membrane. Blood samples were taken at 30 min, and 1,2,3, and 8 hours after isotope injection. 4^Ca crossed the yolk sac membrane and appeared in the plasma of all groups with 9 day embryos showing the highest rate of uptake. Vitamin D treatment significantly enhanced the uptake of ?Ca in all groups compared to control. In contrast, PTH treatment caused slight but significant elevation in ^5Ca uptake only in the 12 day embryos. We suggest that vitamin D may enhance calcium uptake from the yolk sac during embryonic development, but that PTH probably does not have an important role in this transport.</page><page sequence="184">184A American Society of Zoologists 970 DISTRIBUTION OF CALCITONIN GENE - RELATED PEPTIDE IN VERTEBRATES. L.W. Kline, *C.W. Cooper and P.K.T. Pang. Univ. of Alberta, Edmonton and Univ. of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston. The distribution of the calcium regulating hormones, parathyroid hormone and calci? tonin, in non-mammalian vertebrates, has been investigated in our laboratory. Calci? tonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is an alternate product of the calcitonin gene, is a vasoactive peptide and may be a neuro- transmitter. Its distribution in non-mammal? ian vertebrates has not been reported. A heterologous radioimmunoassay using guinea pig antiserum raised against human CGRP was developed and used to measure immunoreactive CGRP (IR-CGRP) in nervous tissues of repre? sentative species. Extracts of brain, spinal cord and pituitary of hagfish, ratfish, dog? fish, flounder, eel, trout, goldfish, sal? mon, turtle, rattlesnake, iguana, chicken, quail, turkey, bovine, rat and mouse were assayed. All except trout, goldfish and iguana brain extracts demonstrated the pre? sence of IR-CGRP. Pituitary extracts from the same animals were assayed. All except ratfish, goldfish and trout contained IR- CGRP. CGRP was present in all classes of animals tested and seems to be highly con? served in the nervous system, where it may act as a neurotransmitter.

Calcium regulation is known "to be hormonally modulated during avian embryogenesis, though the ontogeny of this regulation is poorly understood. We investigated the effects of i,25(OH)2D3, bovine parathyroid hormone (bPTH) or vehicle (ethanol or saline) on incorporation o-f ^Ca into yolk sac tissue in vitro o-f 6, 9, 12, and 15 day embryos. Animals were injected with l,25(OH)2D3 (130 ng/dose), bPTH (4&gt;ug/dose), or vehicle directly into the yolk sac compartment 48 and 24 hours prior to the experiment. Small pieces of yolk sac were incubated up to 3 hours at room temperature in 1 mM CaCl2 concentration to which ^Ca was added (1 ;uCi/ml). In control yolk sac tissue the rate of 45Ca uptake was greatest in younger embryos with decreasing rates of uptake at developmentally more advanced ages. Vitamin D treatment enhanced the uptake of 4'ca into yolk sac tissue in embryos of all ages. In constrast, PTH treatment caused a slight elevation in 45Ca uptake only in the day 12 and 15 day embryos. Thus, the yolk sac appears to be a target of vitamin D. We suggest the vitamin D may enhance calcium uptake from the yolk sac during embryonic development but that PTH does not play a major role in calcium transport across the embryonic chick yolk sac membrane. 972 DEVELOPMENT QF A JUVINILE HCRM3NE RADIO- IMMUNQASSAY. W.G. Goodman and D.C. Ooy. University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA. A method for the synthesis of juvenile hormone Ill-thyroglobulin oonjugate was developed which yielded an epitope den? sity of 104 mol of juvenile hormone (JH) per mol carrier protein. The resulting antiserum displayed minimal cross-reac- tivity with JH metabolites including JH acids, JH diols, and analogs but sub? stantial cross-reactivity between JH homologs. Minimal sensitivity of the assay toward raceraic JH III was 50 pg. Employing different radiolabeled homologs resulted in changes in binding specifi? city. A method for preparing samples from whole body and hemolymph for RIA was de? veloped. This procedure utilized organic solvent extraction followed by thin layer chrornatography. Oirornabcgraphic dyes were used to detect the hormone on TLC plates. Biological blanks (hemolymph samples known to contain essentially no JH) did not interf ere with the assay when this procedure was employed. Hemolymph samples spiked with known amounts of JH and cor- rected for recovery yielded the expected amounts. JH determinations on whole body and hemolymph extracts of Manduca sexta were in good agreement with GC/MS data. 973 CONTROL OF EKPRESS10N OF DOPA DECARBOKYLASE GENE BY ECDYSTEROID AND JUVENILE HORMONE IN MANDUCA SEKTA. K? Hiruroa and L.M, Riddiford, Univ. of Washington, Seattle, WA In Manducat the absence of juvenile hormone (JH) at head capsule slippage (HCS) during a larval molt causes the new cuticle to melanize later. Since dopamine is the main precursor to this melanin, dopa decarboxylase (DDC) levels are two-fold higher than in nonmelanizing larvae. Using the Drosophila DDC gene we isolated the Manduca DDC gene which hybridizes with a 3 kfc mRNA from the epidermis that produces a 4S kD translation product that is precipitated by the Drosophila DDC antibody. This RNA appears ar HCS+12 hr and is maximal 7 hr later. Peak expression was two-fold higher in melanizing allatectomized larvae and could be depressed to normal levels by JH application at HCS. Infusion of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE) or addition of 20-HE to the culture medium reduced the expression. Thus, JH determines the level of later expression whereas the decline of ecdysteroid is necessary for this expression to occur.

Evans and Barbara Stav. Department of Biology, Univ. of Iowa, Iowa City. A protein-rich milk is secreted by the brood sac of Dioloptera punctata during pregnancy. Milk production is first detected by rocket-immuno- electrophoresis at 13 days of pregnancy and in? creases as the embryos grow. Our objective here is to identify factors that initiate milk synthesis. Denervating the brood sac from the last abdomi? nal ganglion did not prevent the onset of milk synthesis, nor did decapitation. Thus, innervation from the last ganglion is not required to initiate milk synthesis nor are signals from the head. Females with unfertilized eggs in the brood sac produced milk on schedule showing that stimuli from developing embryos are unnecessary. How? ever, brood sacs from newly emerged females produced milk within 2 days after implantation into hosts synthesizing abundant milk. We con- clude that humoral stimulation initiates milk syn? thesis, and its source is neither the head nor the developing embryos. 976 A SLOWER RATE OF TADPOLE HINDLIMB GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT WHEN THYROXINE IS GIVEN IN THE DARK IS LINKED TO A DELAY IN THE CELL DIVISION CYCLE. M.L. Wright, N. Pathamma- vong*, and CA. Basso*. Coll. of Our Lady of the Elms, Chicopee, MA. In Rana pipiens tadpoles, thyroxine (T4) injection in the early light promotes faster hindlimb growth and development than injection early in the dark. T4 also stimulates a significant increase in cell proliferation in the basal epidermal cells of the limb. Using autoradiography, we studied the timing of the T4-induced rise in the labeling and mitotic indices on 12L:12D cycles with 0.2&gt;ug T4 injection early in the light or dark, and on a 12L: 3D:1L:8D cycle with a light pulse early in the dark shortly after a T4 injection. In all instances, the labeling index peaked at the same time after the start of T4, so diurnal differences in the binding or initial actions of T4 are not indicated. However, with T4 injection in the dark, the subsequent mitotic index peak was delayed, to a greater extent on 12L:12D than on 12L:3D:1L:8D. Cells induced to proliferate following T4 injection in the dark evidently had longer cell cycles, probably at the expense of the S or G2 phase. Hormones acting at the level of the cell cycle to modulate the mitogenic action of T4 might be involved. 977 LEVELS OF THYROID HORMONES/ INSULIN GLUCAGON/ AND GLUCAGON-LIKE PEPTIDE IN VARIOUS BLOOD VESSELS OF TROUT. CV, Sullivan and E.M. Plisetskaya Univ. of Washington/ Seattle. Blood was sampled from the hepatic portal vein/ caudal vein and heart/ of 26 immature rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) 18 hours after they were last fed. Plasma levels of thyroxin (T4), 3/5/3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3)/ insulin/ glucagon/ and glu- cagon-like peptide (GLP) were meas? ured by homologous radioimmunoassay. T4 and T3 had uniform titers in all blood vessels (T^ 9.1-9.8 ng/ml; To 5.6-6.0 ng/ml). Levels of insulin/ glucagon and GLP in hepatic portal blood (5.96+0.89, 0.44+0.08 and 0.54+0.05 ng7ml) were 77/ 89 and 61 percent higher/ respectively/ than their average level in the other two blood vessels. The higher hormonal titers to which the liver/ as compared to other target tissues/ is exposed should be taken into account when dosages of pancreatic hormones are calculated for jji vivo or jji vitro experiments on fish.</page><page sequence="186">186A American Society of Zoologists 978 EFFECTS OF THYROXINE ON BASAL METABO?

Gettysburg College, Gettysburg, PA The effects of T4 on metabolism and liver mitochondrial volume were ex? amined in Thamnophis sirtalis held at two different temperatures. Experi? mental animals were injected daily for three weeks with T4 (200 ng/g body weight in a lmM NaOH solution); con? trol animals received injections of lmM NaOH over the same time period. To investigate possible mediating ef? fects of temperature, half of the ani? mals were maintained at 10?C and half at 25? to 30?C. Basal metabolism was increased only in the T4~treated ani? mals maintained at the warmer tempera? ture. Stereological measurements were made on electron micrographs of liver sections from the animals that had been maintained at 25?C. Mitochondrial con? tribution to cell volume did increase significantly in response to the hy- perthyroid condition. 979 ENERGETIC COSTS OF INCREASED AGGRESSION IN TESIOSIERQNE-IMPL\MED MALES CA Marler and M.C. Moore. Arizona State Univ., Tempe. Increased aggression of testosterone (T) implanted free-living male mountain spiny lizards (Sceloporus jarrovi) causes a decrease in their survivorship. Previous correlational evidence supported two hypotheses explaining the greater mortality of T-impIanted males compared to controls: (1) they are more conspicuous to predators and (2) they incur greater energetic costs due to increased territorial defense. To distinguish between these two hypotheses the diet of T-implanted males was supplemented with mealworms. If energetics causes the differences in survival, then feeding should increase survival. Alternatively, if males have lower survival as a result of increased conspicuousness to predators, then feeding should not affect survival. Food supplements prevented the loss of stored lipids that occurs in unfed T-implanted males relative to controls, suggesting that fed males had a more positive energy balance. The more positive energy balance of fed T-implanted males also caused them to have significantly greater survivorship than unfed males. This greater survival of food supplemented, T-implanted males strongly supports the energetics hypothesis. 980 OPIATE CONTROL OF LOCONOTION IN A URODELE AMPHIBIAN (Taricha granu? losa). P. Deviche. CA. Lowry and F.L. Moore. Oregon State University, Corvallis. An intraperitoneal injection of the opiate k agonist bremazocine HC1 given to male rough-skinned newts dose-dependently produced an acute in? hibition of their locomotor activity. This inhibition was counteracted by preceding the bremazocine injection with an injection of the opiate recep? tor antagonist naloxone. Given by it? self, contrary to what is generally observed in mammals, naloxone dose- dependently stimulated locomotion. The effects of bremazocine and naloxo? ne were observed using two different sampling techniques (continuous recor? ding for 3 minutes; repeated instan- taneous sampling for 60 minutes). These data provide the first evidence that an opioid mechanism may influence locomotion in an amphibian. 981 INTERACTION BETWEEN THE OPIOID SYSTEN AND CORTICOTROPIN RELEASING FACTOR IN THE CONTROL OF LOCOMOTION IN AN AMPHIBIAN. CA. Lowrv. P. Deviche and F.L. Moore. Oregon State Univ., Corvallis. Intracerebroventricular (icv), but not intraperitoneal (ip), injections of CRF into male rough-skinned newts (Taricha granulosa) resulted in dose-dependent increases in locomotor activity, indicating that CRF may act centrally to stimulate locomotion. When newts were injected ip with amphibian Ringer's 20 min prior to an icv injection of CRF, CRF failed to stimulate locomotion. However, when newts were injected ip with naloxone 20 min prior to an icv injection of CRF, CRF resulted in increased locomotion. Further, ip injections of bremazocine, an opiate /c-receptor agonist, suppressed locomotion when given alone but not when given in conjunction with CRF. These data indicate that, in amphibians, locomotion may be regulated by interactions between CRF and opioids.</page><page sequence="187">Abstracts 187A 982 DIURNAL FEEDING PERIODICITY OF A HERBIV? OROUS BLENNIID FISH IN THE WESTERN KEDITERRANEAN. M. H. Horn. S. N. Murray*. M. B. Fris* and C. D. Irelan*. California State Univ., Fullerton. Taborsky and Limberger (1980. P.S.Z.N.I: Mar Ecol 1) reported that in the northern Adriatic Parablennius sansuinolentus increases its feeding activity from morning to late afternoon, and hypothesized that the resulting afternoon feeding peak corresponds to the period of greatest nutritional content of the fish's algal food resource. Results of our work on P. s ansuinolentus in Mallorcan waters partially support this hypothesis in that small fish increase their feeding rate by afternoon but continue to feed on a red algal turf whereas large fish do not increase their feeding rate significantly during the day; instead they switch from this turf to a higher quality algal food (Ulva) in the afternoon. Ulva. a main dietary species, shows a decrease in ash and protein content but an increase in carbohydrate and energy content over the day. Thus, only large fish appear to maximize their energy intake but small fish may be prevented from doing so by the behavioral dominance of large fish. 983 REDUCING THE CONSEQUENCES OF HERBIVORE DAMAGE IN AN INTERTIDAL KELP. D.K. Padilla. Cornell University, Ithaca, NY. Most maerophytes are subject to herbivore grazing in the intertidal zone. The subsequent consequences of this damage in terms of tissue loss may far out weigh the amount of tissue lost to herbivores directly. Katharina tunicata, a large chiton, is an important herbivore of the intertidal zone kelp, Hedophyllum sessile. Katharina feeds by taking large, triangular shaped bites from the edge of the thallus. Simulated chitons bites resulted in blades tearing upon wave impact, however, the blades tore parallel to the long axis of the thallus, minimizing the amount of tissue that was lost. Undamaged control thalli attached to the same holdfast did not tear during the same time period. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that the breaking strength of damaged thalli was twice as great perpendicular to the long axis of the thallus as compared with the breaking strength along the long axis of the plant. This would promote a preferential direction of tearing along the long axis of the thallus. Macrocystis , a subtidal kelp is not exposed to similar biting type herbivores. When tested in a similar fashion, there was no difference in breaking strength perpendicular to or parallel with the long axis of the thallus. The structure of Hedophyllum thus results in minimal tissue loss once damaged. Similar types of structural responses may be important in determining which algae will be least affected by herbivore damage in wave swept environments. 984 ECOLOGICAL COMPARISONS OF. SPECIALIST AND GENERALIST MARINE HERBIVORES. CD.Trowbridge. Oregon State Univ., Corvallis. Comparisons of specialist and generalist herbivores have been limited to terrestrial species. Analogous comparisons of marine herbivores are made possible by new information on the oligo- phagous mollusc Placida dendritica (Gastropoda: Opisthobranchial Ascoglossa) . On the low intertidal green alga Codium setchellii, Placida's abundance is comparable to that of generalist molluscs and crustaceans. In contrast to terrestrial specialists, Placida's abundance (#/alga) is not a function of host density or community complexity. Analogous to terrestrial specialists, Placida is more sensitive than generalists to differential algal condition: Placida selectively attacks stressed Codium. Thus, marine herbivores exhibit some, but not all, patterns demonstrated for terrestrial herbivores. Research on other ascoglossans is needed to evaluate the robustness of the results. 985 HERBIVORY BY CARIBBEAN MAJID CRABS: FEEDING ECOLOGY AND PLANT SUSCEPTIBILITY. Loren EX Coen. University of South Alabama, P.O.Box 369, Dauphin Island, AL 36528. The present study investigated plant susceptibility, plant quality and food preferences in two mesograzers, the crabs Mithrax sculptus (Lamarck) and M- coryphe (Herbst) in Belize. Plants were chosen based on traits, including relative abundance, percent ash and water, caloric contents and previous observations on plant susceptibility to herbivores. In single preference (day and night) and multiple selection experiments, preferences for both crabs were similar among the plants tested and concordant with those determined previously for fish and urchins on other Caribbean reefs. Mithrax successfully manipulated and consumed both corticated (Laurencia. Acanthophora") and leathery (Padina. Lobophora ruffled form) macroalgae using their spatulate chelae, except where plant secondary chemistry probably reduced consumption (Lobophora decumbent form and Stvpopodiurq).</page><page sequence="188">188A American Society of Zoologists 986 TIMING OF GRAZING INFLUENCES SURVIVAL OF AN INTERTIDAL RED ALGA. Ladd E. Johnson. University of Washington, Seattle. Herbivorous molluscs typically exert a strong negative impact on intertidal macroalgae, presumably through the consumption of the sporeling stages during nonselective grazing of microalgal films. Experiments were performed to determine which periods of the early ontogeny of the red alga Halosaccion alandiforme were most susceptible to grazing. Artificial substrata molded in the shape of the barnacle Semibalanus cariosus were protected from grazers for various periods of time during the six months after settlement by H. alandiforme. Results indicate that grazing between the second and fourth months had the greatest detrimental effect on the algae. Surprisingly, grazing in the first two month period enhanced colonization and growth rate3 which eventually translated into higher survival at six months. The use of spatial refuges between ridges on the barnacle cannot explain this result since H. alandiforme settles almost exclusively on the tops of such ridges. The explanation may lie in either seasonally variable grazing pressure or ontogenetic changes in herbivore resistance. 987 PRAIRIE DOG FOOD PREFERENCE AND THE PHOTOSYNTHETIC PATHWAY - SELECTIVE HERBIVORY HYPOTHESIS. H. Wells and W. Mason*, Univ. of Tulsa, Tulsa, OK. The "photosynthetic pathway - selective herbivory" hypothesis predicts that herbivors will prefer C3 over C4 plants as food. Black-tail prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) were used as a test of this hypothesis. The Cij species tested were Setaria italica, Zea mays, Eragrostis curvula, and Salsola kali. The C3 species tested were Arachis hypogea, Daucus carota, Helianthus annus, and Lactuca sativa. Four experiments were performed. I. Each food plant species was presented separately to test whether C_. ludovicianus would eat each species. II. All four C3 plants were presented simultaneously to test for preferences within the C3 plant food group. III. All four C4 plants were presented simultaneously to test for preferences within the C4 plant food group. IV. Finally, all four C3 and all four C4 plants were presented simultaneously to test for preferences between C3 and C4 plants. Data demonstrated that prairie dogs have significant food preferences within both the C3 and Cjj plant groups tested. However, no statistical preference for either C3 or C4 plants existed. 988 TANNING AND THE CACHING BEHAVIOR OF GRAY SQUIRRELS. D. Nesdill. Auburn Univer., Auburn, AL. Gray squirrels, Sclurus carolinensis, have been shown to preferentially cache acorns having high tannin levels (TL) while ingesting acorns with low TL. The present study was designed to determine whether, by burying acorns containing high TL, squirrels are exposing these acorns to environmental conditions which promote the reduction of TL. Water oak acorns, Quercus nigra, collected fall 1987 and subjected to four treatments: burial by scatter- hoarding, burial by larderhoarding, storage at room temperature without burial or under ambient environmental conditions without burial, were subsequently retrieved in Jan., Feb. and Apr., 1988 and TL determined. Results show TL declined 32% during burial and this decline was significantly greater for acorns buried and stored under ambient conditions than for acorns stored at room temperature. These results suggest the requirement of acorns to exposure to low temperatures to reduce TL. Furthermore, burying protects acorns from pilferage by conspecifics until TL of acorns is low enough for squirrels to ingest. 989 SEA OTTERS, BUTTER CLAMS AND PARALYTIC SHELLFISH TOXINS. R. G. Kvitek Univ. of Washington, Seattle Captive sea otters in Kodiak, Alaska, were fed toxic and non-toxic butter clams (Saxidomus giganteus) ad libitum to determine the response of these predators to prey containing paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) and to investigate the effectiveness of sequestered PST as a chemical defense. Five otters readily consumed non-toxic butter clams, but greatly reduced or stopped their feeding when switched to toxic prey (200 ug STX/100 g tissue). Feeding rates returned to the pre-treatment level when otters were again given non-toxic clams. None of the otters exceeded the oral LD50 doses reported for most mammals, and none of the otters exhibited paralytic shellfish poisoning symptoms. Rejection of toxin containing tissues (siphons and gills with kidneys) by the otters increased dramatically during toxic feeding trials. These findings suggest that sea otters are able to detect and avoid PST containing prey and that PST could function as an secondarily acquired chemical defense in the butter clam. As a result, PST may be responsible in part for the historic absence of sea otters from the inside waters of southeast Alaska, an area renown for highly toxic bivalve prey.</page><page sequence="189">Abstracts 189A 990 DIEL TIMING OF LARVAL RELEASE AND SETTLEMENT OF A COLONIAL TUNICATE IN PEARL HARBOR, OAHU, HAWAII. CJ. Hurlbut Univ, of Hawaii, Honolulu, For sessile marine invertebrates with short-lived larvae, daily time of larval release into the plankton can determine both conditions encountered in the plankton and environmental cues avail? able at settlement. I examined the diel pattern of larval release of Didemnum candidum by capturing larvae in three ways: I 1) counted larvae released hourly from adults placed in traps, 2) sampled larvae in the plankton every two hours using a pump, and 3) determined settling times on plates immersed for two-hour periods. All three methods yielded a similar diel pattern of larval release and settlement. Larvae and settlers were only present during the daytime, with a strong early morning and weaker afternoon peak in abundance. The planktonic period of these larvae appears too be quite brief in the field. The time of larval release, planktonic period and settlement are closely linked, and can be used to estimate each other. Further sampling will determine the importance of larval release time to settlement location and hence its implications to juvenile survival. 991 FIELD ESTIMATES OF LARVAL MORTALITY RATES IN A COLONIAL ASCIDIAN. Douglas JL. Stoner. Univ. of Hawaii, Honolulu. In the past larval mortality rates for marine invertebrates have only been estimated by using indirect methods which rely on a variety of untested assumptions. I present here the results of a study which used direct field observations to estimate larval mortality rates and separate out the effects of planktonic and benthic mortality sources. Larval mortality rates were estimated by using SCUBA to follow individual larvae of the colonial ascidian, Dinlosoma similis. from the time of release from the parent colony to the time larvae either settled, were captured or were lost. Over 70% of the larvae produced survived the planktonic dispersal phase which lasted an average of 3 minutes. Planktonic predators accounted for only 7% of all larval mortality even though the density of planktivorous fish on the study reef exceeded 0.5 fish per m . Preliminary results from a predator exclusion experiment suggest that the the low impact of planktivorous fish on larval mortality rates was not an artifact of divers disturbing the fish. I propose that larval mortality was low as a result of 1) a constant, low-level production rate of larvae and 2) the production of short-range dispersing larvae. 992 LARVAL-ADULT INTERACTIONS IN COLD-WATER CORALS: MEDIATION OF INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION. N..E.. Q!l?dwi.ck.. Interuniversity Institute of Eiiat, Israel. This study examined the role of behavioral interactions between planula larvae and adults during competition for space between two species of temperate anthozoans. Coral polyps of Balangp.hyl,l.i.a elegans that were subjected to contact with the coral1imorpharian Q.9C.yo?c;t;is cal^ifgrnica in the laboratory produced significantly fewer larvae over two reproductive seasons than did controls. Released larvae exhibited higher mortality in aquaria that contained coralli- morpharians than in those without. Coral larvae settied and metamor? phosed at greater distances from shells bearing coral1imorpharians than from shells lacking polyps. Coral larvae were seized and injested by any coral1imorpharians they encountered. These results indicate that interactions between larvae and adults may be important in mediating competition between temperate anthozoans. 993 INFLUENCE OF SPONGES ON RECRUITMENT OF INVERTEBRATE LARVAE: IS ALLELOPATHY IMPORTANT? B.L. Bingham. Florida State Univ., Tallahassee. I tested the hypothesis that sponges release chemicals that inhibit recruitment of invertebrate larvae. Experiments were done in three locations: the indian River, Florida; Big Pine Key, Florida Keys; and Carrie Bow Cay, Belize, Central America. At each site, live sponges of three species were suspended near the faces of ceramic tiles. Tiles with artificial sponges positioned in a similar manner and tiles with no sponges served as controls, Sponges did not inhibit settlement of any of the invertebrate species observed (i.e. sponges, anemones, annelids, bivalves and ascidians). While recruitment of some species was enhanced in the presence of sponges, most of the significant experimental results were due to higher settlement on tiles that had the flow unobstructed by sponges. Significant block effects indicated that patchiness in larval supply was important in determining patterns of recruitment. In communities dominated by sponges, patchy larval supply and differential flow are more important structuring factors than are allelopathic effects of the sponges on settling larvae.</page><page sequence="190">190A American Society of Zoologists 994 AN UNUSUAL SETTLEMENT OF THE BARNACLE (MEGABALANUS CALIFORNICUS) ON TURBAN SNAILS (TEGULA SPP.) IN A CENTRAL CALIFORNIA KELP FOREST. E.B. Halliday.Unlv. of Calif., Santa Cruz. In January of 1988 at Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, CA an unusual settlement of M.callfornicus on kelp- dwelling turban snails (Tequla spp.) was observed. The purpose of this study was to describe the settlement as it relates to the snails and to the barnacles. The study site was randomly sampled over a four month period, and all Tequla spp. were collected from the canopy and the benthos. The proportion of fouled snails for each species and the size, abundance, and reproductive status of the barnacles within each sample was recorded. At least 60% of the fouled snails were T.brunnae. Over the study time, the abundance of barnacles decreased, whereas the size increased. Viable barnacle embryo sacs were found in some of the samples. In lab, the escape velocity of fouled Tegula spp. snails was significantly different than unfouled snails (U-value at C.L.=.95). Hence, it appears that the barnacle recruitment was an episodic event which did not seem to significantly impact the snail population. Additionly, the short- lived barnacles were still able to become reproductive and spread their progeny. 995 FACTORS INFLUENCING THE SETTLEMENT OF BARNACLES AND MUSSELS ON A ROCKY INTER? TIDAL SHORE IN NOVA SCOTIA^ T.M. Minch- inton and R.E. Scheibling. Dalhousie Univ., Halifax, Nova Scotia. Settlement rates of the barnacle, Semibalanus balanoides, and the mussel, Mytilus edulis, were monitored on mani- pulated quadrats at three intertidal heights on a rocky shore on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia. Our objective was to determine the relationship between settlement intensity and the presence/ absence of the major flora and fauna at each intertidal height. Barnacle settle? ment density was inversely correlated with height on shore, the low intertidal zone having the highest number of set- tlers. In the high intertidal zone, bar? nacle settlement density ranked as fol? lows: natural community&gt; fucoid removal&gt; ephemeral algae removal &gt; cleared patch. This appears to parallel the degree of wetness in each area. In the mid and low intertidal zones, barnacle settlement den? sity was, in general, positively corre? lated with free space availability on the substratum regardless of community compo? sition. This could reflect a planktonic larval abundance which may have been satu- rating. Pump-collected plankton samples at each intertidal height and mussel set? tlement data are under analysis. 996 HARD SUBSTRATA COMMUNITY STRUCTURE: RELATIVE ROLES OF LARVAL SETTLEMENT AND POST-SETTLEMENT EVENTS. B.L. Young. Univ. South Caroiina, Columbia. High variability in species composition and relative abundances are known to exist among substrata in the intertidal. Data were collected from a community of sessile invertebrates with planktonic larvae to determine whether initial settlement patterns or post-settlement phenomena were most important as determinants of community structure. In South Caroiina, the barnacle Chthamalus fragilis prefers high intertidal sites, but can occupy bare space in the low intertidal. The barnacle Balanus eburneus and the oyster Crassostrea virginica easily overgrow the smaller C. fragilis and dominate bare space in the low intertidal. However, initial settlement rates for these two main competitors do not appear to be effective predictors of relative abundances or percent covers. Variability in post- settlement mortality and growth rates on a microspatial scale (cm) appears to be important in influencing the composition of mature communities after settlement has determined species availability.

X2yQ9i_ University of Oklahoma, Norman, and Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution, Fort Pierce, Florida. Laboratory studies of larval settlement behavior form the basis for much of our understanding of field processes. Many laboratory studies use more than a single larva per replicate in settlement experiments. In such experiments, gregarious settlement of larvae may obscure or override choices made at settlement by solitary individuals. We use a computer simulation to document the extent of such biases in laboratory studies. Larvae are assigned a preference for a particular substrate, and subsequent settlement is modified by gregarious behavior. The simulation illustrates the extent to which gregarious settlement can affect patterns of substrate choice, and provides some insights into experimental design.</page><page sequence="191">Abstracts 191A 998 GREGARIOUS SETTLEMENT: DOES IT PROMOTE GREATER OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUAL BALANUS GLANDULA TO REPRODUCE? Mark Shibata. Hopkins Marine Station, Stanford University, Pacific Grove. Balanus glandula is an outcrossing barnacle species and therefore must live in close proximity to other individuals in order to reproduce. Investigators have reasoned that by settling in and amongst adult individuals, cyprids were assured that the environment was hospitable and that mates were available. In fact, it has been proposed that the ability of cyprids to chemically sense the presence of adults made good sense in that it enhanced the individual's probability of reproducing. Yet this hypothesis is valid only if the habitat, at the time of settlement, reflects conditions when the individual reaches reproductive maturity. The habitat stability of various possible settlement sites within aggregations of B. glandula was examined. The quality or the site was predicated on the number of available mates within reach of an individual. The "best" and "worst" sites within an aggregation were chosen at the time of settlement and then re-examined at the time of reproductive maturity. Results indicate that, at least on this microhabitat scale for the sites examined, gregarious settlement behaviors are not advantageous and most often are a detriment to the individual. Sensing the presence or absence of adults is ?erhaps of greater importance on a arger scale. 999 BIOLUMINESCENCE OF PHOTICALLY STIMULATED PYROSOMES. Mark R. Bowlby and James F. Case. University of California, Santa Barbara. Pyrosomes are colonial tunicates which produce bioluminescence when stimulated by flashes of light. Pyrosoma atlanticum and Pyrosomella verticillata were collected off Hawaii between 4 00 and 800m depth, and investigated with an integrat- ing sphere, photon counting appara? tus. An average light stimulated bioluminescent event has a latency of 1.3s, a duration of 12.4s, and a total light output of 6.9 x 1011 photons flash-1. Photic stimula? tion (0.5s duration) of 4 x 10~6 uW cm"2 at wavelengths between 3 50 and 600nm induces bioluminescence, with the maximum intensity response in? duced at 475nm. The photic excita? tion threshold (50% responding) is 3.0 x 10~7 jaW cm"2 at 475nm. In Hawaiian waters, the threshold stimulus could be produced, for ex? ample, by the calanoid copepod Pleuromamma xiphias at up to 0.22m distance from the pyrosome. 1000 LIGHT AND FEEDING INFLUENCE TEMPERATURE RELATED EXPULSION OF ZOOXANTHELLAE BY THE SEA ANEMONE AIPTASIA PULCHELLA. Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, Dept. Biology, U.C.L.A., Los Angeles CA 90024. The rate at which Aiptasia pulchella expels zooxanthellae is normally low. When anemones are placed in the dark, the population specific expulsion rate increases. If the incubation temperature is reduced to 15oC or increased to 32oC then this response is eliminated. Anemones incubated at 32oC and irradiated at normal light levels expel zooxanthellae at normal rates until the day 14 at which time the specific expulsion rate increases dramatically. Starved anemones exhibited this response four days earlier (at day 10). Electron micrographs revealed the deteriation of zooxanthellae at 32oC. These results demonstrate that light and feeding significantly influence the temperature-dependent expulsion of A. pulchella and suggest that the number of zooxanthellae in the host animal cell is determined by some aspect of metabolic activity and not by simple volumetric constraints of the algal to, animal biomass ratio. 1001 DAY-NIGHT RHYTMS IN THE INHIBITORY EFFECTS 0F 60 HZ MAGNETIC FIELDS 0N OPIATE-INDUCED ANALGESIA IN THE SNAIL, CEPAEA NEMORALIS. M. Kavaliers, K.-P. Ossenkopp and S. Lipa, Univ. Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada. There is accumulating evidence to suggest that magnetic fields can affect the activity of endogenous opioid systems. Opioid systems are involved in the modulation of the aversive behavioral and physiological responses of both vertebrates and invertebrates. Adminis? tration of morphine to the land snail, Cepaea nemoralis, elicits an increase in the latency of an avoidance behavior to a warmed surface, with the snails display- ing a significantly greater analgesic response at night. Exposure (5 days, 12 or 2 hours) to weak 60Hz magnetic fields in either the dark or light period different- ially reduces the levels of this morphine- induced analgesia, with there being a significantly greater reduetion of the night-time responses. These results indicate that exposure to weak 60 Hz magnetic fields can affect day-night rhythms of opiate-mediated behaviors.</page><page sequence="192">192A American Society of Zoologists 1002 THE EFFECTS OF ULTRAVIOLET AND VISIBLE RADIATION ON UV ABSORBING COMPOUNDS IN CNIDARIANS. W.R. Stochai. Univ. of Maine, Orono. Researchers have shown that ihe conccnlration of ultraviolet absorbing (S320) compounds in sclcractinian corals increase with increased exposure lo both visible and UV radiation. These compounds may protect against the deleterious effects of U V. Here, three species of anemones and one species of coral were examined for the presence of S320 compounds to deter? mine if this relationship occurs in other cnidarians. Laboratory acclimation of a cultured clone oiAiptasia pallida produced no significant increase in its S320 compounds with increased UV exposure but a significant increase with visible light exposure. Similar effects due to U V were obtained for Anthopleura elegantissima. A. pallida freshly collected from the field and acclimated under natural irradiances with and without UV showed no significant increase in its S320 compounds due to UV and a significant increase in only one of its five com? pounds due to increased visible irradiance. In all acclimations, UV absorbing compounds showed a trend toward increased conccnlration wiih UV exposure. Specimens from a single colony of the hcrmaiypic coral Montasirea annularis were col? lected from bright and dim areas. Polyps from the bright areas had significantly higher conccnlraiions of UV absorbing com? pounds than those from the dim areas. These results suggest that the relationship between S320 compounds and UV radiation may not hold for all cnidarians or all UV absorbing compounds. The presence ofa fifth S320 compound in ficld- frcsh A. pallida and high concentrations of S320 compounds in aposymbiotic A. elegantissima and in the nonsymbiolic Actinia bermudensis suggests an animal or dietary origin, rather than ihe hypothesized zooxanthellae origin for these compounds in cnidarians.

AN EPIPHENOMENON? M.A. Coffroth. RSMAS, Univ. of Miami., Miami, FL Mucus of some coral undergoes a transformation to form structured mucous coverings, termed mucous sheets. These are common on poritid corals and many other coelenterates, but their function is unknown. Mucous sheet formation can be induced under stressful conditions, but mucous sheets are routinely observed in the field. Mucous sheet formation in Porites furcata and P. astreoides has a lunar periodicity in Panama. The observation that polyps contract prior to mucous sheet formation both during the lunar cycle of mucous sheet formation and when a coral is stressed leads to the hypothesis that polyp contraction may be related to reductions in mucous secretions and ciliary currents on the coral surface. Data suggest that when mucus on the coral surface is not moved, a mucous sheet forms. Experiments also demonstrate that mucous sheets do not normally clear the coral surface of sediment and bacteria. Therefore, it is likely that mucous sheet formation is an epiphenomenon response of periodic polyp contraction of poritids and the accompanying reduction in mucous secretion. 1004 SPECIES DIFFERENCES IN DIET AND PREY SELECTION BY HYDROMEDUSAE. Claudia E. Mills. Friday Harbor Laboratories, University of Washington, Friday Harbor, WA . It is sometimes assumed that jellyfish are indiscriminate predators on available zooplankton and that copepods provide the mainstay of most jellyfish diets. Gut analyses performed on individually field- caught medusae show that different medusae occupying the same water mass have very different diets and that these diets are species-specific. For example, in May 1987 in Friday Harbor, Phialidium ate 80% eggs and embryos, Mitrocomella ate 70% larvaceans, Bougainvillia ate 90% barnacle nauplii, Aequorea ate 90% hydromedusae, and Sarsia ate 40% copepods and 40% barnacle nauplii. Diets for all species change with seasonal availability of prey. As a result of whole animal as weU as micro- scopic studies, I propose that prey selection by hydromedusae is determined by a combination of stereotyped behavior and anatomy. Species-specific nematocyst arrays on the jellyfish tentacles and manubrium are a general indicator of diet, but the correlation is not perfect. Prey selection is also dependent on the species-specific swimming patterns that result from the interaction of distinct beU morph? ologies (affected by passive flow interactions) and different pulsation rhythms (driven by endogenous pacemakers). Time allocations between swimming and feeding activities also vary by species. 1005 SUSPENSION-FEEDING AND THE NUTRITIONAL BIOLOGY 0F A HYDR0CARB0N SEEP AND A HYDROTHERMAL VENT MUSSEL. H.M. Page, C.R. Fisher, and J.J. Childress. Univ. of Calif., Santa Barbara. We report a laboratory study of the suspension-feeding capabilities of an undescribed mussel from a hydrocarbon seep in the Gulf of Mexico and Bathymodiolus thermophilus from the Galapagos hydrothermal vents. In comparative experiments, seep mussels and M. edulis were offered radiolabeled bacteria and algae. B. thermophilis was offered labeled bacteria under pressure. Seep mussels cleared bacteria and algae from suspension, but at slower rates than M. edulis. The incorporation of label, estimated from tissue counts and collection of feces, was lower in the seep mussel than in Mj_ edulis. B. thermophilus also cleared bacteria. The highest percentage of label on a weight- specific basis in all mussels was in the gills, followed by the body and mantle. Chemosynthetic endosymbiotic bacteria are throught to be a source of organic carbon in vent and seep mussels. Particulate food is potentially an important source of organic carbon and essential nutrients not supplied by these endosymbionts.</page><page sequence="193">Abstracts 193A 1006 UTILIZATION OF CELLULOSIC DETRITUS BY SUBTIDAL AND INTERTIDAL POPULATIONS OF THE MUSSEL, GEUKENSIA DEMISSA. D.A. Kreeger. Oregon State Univ., Newport. The dominant bivalve mollusc inhabiting the intertidal zone of east coast salt marshes is the ribbed mussel, Geukensia demissa. Although salt marshes are detritus- based ecosystems, the role of particulate detritus in the nutrition of GL. demissa is unknown. The ability of (L. demissa to utilize the cellulosic component of detritus was evaluated in either simulated subtidal (100% submergence) or intertidal (50/50% exposure/submergence) conditions. Subtidal mussels absorbed C from l C-labeled lignocellulose with a mean (? SD) efficiency of 9.2 ? 2.5 %; whereas, the mean (+ SD) carbon absorption efficiency of intertidal G. demissa was significantly greater (p &lt;0.01) at 14.9 ? 1.8 %. The mean (? SD) concentration of cellulose in seston samples collected from a Delaware salt marsh was 66 + 28 /jg Jt' during summer (July-August). It was estimated that subtidal and intertidal (50% aerial exposure) mussels inhabiting this marsh during these months could absorb cellulosic carbon at rates of 1.14 and 0.92 mg day" per gram dry tissue weight, respectively. These rates of carbon absorption represent 16.0 % and 15.2 % of the total carbon requirements of intertidal and subtidal populations of G^ demissa. respectively. 1007 MICROENCAPSULATED DIETARY PROTEIN FOR A MARINE SUSPENSION-FEEDER, CRASSOSTREA GIGAS. C. J. tangdon. Oregon State Univers ity. A method was developed to deliver C-14 labelled dietary protein to a marine suspension-feeder, the oyster Crassostrea gigas, by encapsulating protein within cross-linked, protein- walled microcapsules in the size range 2 to 15 microns. Leakage of protein from capsules suspended in seawater for 2k hours could be reduced to less than k% by modifi? cation of capsule wall composition. Encapsulated C-l^ could be enzymat- ica1ly released from the capsules by in vi tro incubation with proteases or stomach fluid extracts of oysters. Feeding experiments indicated that C. gigas could absorb Z-\k from encapsulated C-14 labelled protein with an efficiency of 39% The results indicate that micro- encapsulation of dietary protein using cross-linked, protein-walled capsules is a potentially useful technique for studies on the feeding and nutrition of marine suspens ion-feeders. 1008 DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION OF PREPARED FOODS CONTAINING PLANT OR ANIMAL MATERIAL BY LYTECHINUS VARIEGATUS LAMARCK (ECHINO- DERMATA: ECHINOIDEA). T.S.Klinger and J.M. Lawrence. Bloomsburg Univ., PA, and Univ. of South Florida, Tampa. When offered foods in similar forms, Lytechinus variegatus digests and absorbs equally plant or animal material. Indivi? duals were maintained in separate contain- ers and fed prepared foods containing either plant or animal meal of known, uni- form composition. Rate of feeding, absorp? tion of organic material, and rate of passage of food through the gut did not differ for either food type. Individuals consumed 3.140+1.482 g.ind .day" of the. animal meal food and 3.392+ 1.259 g.ind" . day" of the plant meal food (mean + STD). Absorption efficiencies were 26.2+7.1% and 24.2+12.4% for the plant and animal foods, respectively. Throughput rate on either food was 1-2 days. Fecal produc? tion ceased within 2 days of cessation of feeding. .L. variegatus did not retain food in the gut. Only 23+0.20 g of food remained In the gut 3 days after cessa? tion of feeding.

The porcupine puffer Diodon holocanthus is able to more than triple its volume by gulping water and forcing it into its stomach. Measurements were made of internal pressure and corresponding volume change during inflation. Pressure vessel theory was used to calculate the stress in the skin from pressure and volume measurements, thus generating an in vivo elastic modulus curve. Uniaxial mechanical tests on strips of excised skin produced in vitro modulus curves. Both the in vivo and in vitro curves were exponential, showing a long region of low stiffness to about 70% strain, and a region of high stiffness at greater extensions. This represents an effective design for extensible tissues: the region of low stiffness allows easy inflation, while the region of high stiffness protects the skin from over- extension. Uniaxial mechanical tests showed slight anisotropy and a great deal of hysteresis. The mechanical behavior of the skin is consistent with a discontinuous feltwork model of collagen and elastin fibers in a mucopolysaccharide matrix. While the skin of most teleost fishes is extensible to less than 20% as a result of straight collagen fibers organized into helically wrapped sheets, histological sections of puffer skui show that the collagen is more disorganized and has a folded appearance when unstreched. The great extensibility of puffer skin in all directions results from these folds and random orientation of the collagen.</page><page sequence="194">194A American Society of Zoologists 1010 INTEGUMENTARY MUSCLE ATTACHMENTS TO THE PELVIC SKIN OF ANURANS. R.M Winokur and S.D. Hi1lyard. Univ. of Nevada, Las Vegas. The gracilis minor muscle and an un- named integumentary muscle form a com? plex network of muscle fiber bundles that attach onto the pelvic skin in some anurans. Noble (Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist. 46:3-76, 1922) noted that integumentary attachments of the gra? cilis minor are better developed in fossorial species. We used an index: attachment area/total surface area (estimated as wt. ), to compare 10 species of North American bufonids. The xeric-adapted species, B_. punctatus anc* JL* kellogi, had index values of 0.83 to 1.63. More mesic-adapted species, B_. marinus, &amp;_. americanus and &amp;_. boreas had index values between 0.52 to 0.64. Examination of 16 species from 9 other anuran families revealed that more extensive integumentary at? tachments occur in fossorial forms, al? though the muscles involved are not necessarily part of the gracilis minor complex. We suggest that integumentary muscle attachments are functionally re? lated to utilization of substrate moi sture. 1011 ONTOGENY OF DERMAL COLLAGEN FIBER PATTERNS IN SALAMANDERS. Larry Frolich. University of Chicago. Whole dermis samples from 40 species of salamanders and a few other select tetrapods were examined using polarized light microscopy. Salamanders with a biphasic life cycle (aquatic larvae; terrestrial adults) exhibit a dramatic reorganization of the pattern of dermal collagen fibers at metamorphosis. Aquatic larvae exhibit a highly "oriented" crossed helical array of fibers in the dermis surrounding the trunk and tail. Terrestrial adults exhibit "matted" fibers with no obvious preferred orientation. Both facultative and obligate neotenic forms retain the oriented condition throughout life. Direct developing plethodontids exhibit the oriented condition as hatchlings with a very early transition to the matted condition. Various fish groups have been reported to retain oriented fibers throughout life. Most frogs and aimiotes undergo the developmental transition to the matted pattern. Thus, the developmental transition to the matted dermal collagen fiber pattern may be a synapomorphy for tetrapods with some species exhibiting a paedomorphic retention of oriented fibers. 1012 THE SUBDERMAL CONNECTIVE TISSUE SHEATH IN DOLPHINS IS NOT A TYPICAL CROSSED HELICAL FIBER ARRAY. D. A. Pabst. Duke Univ., Durham, N.C. The subdermal connective tissue sheath (SDS) is a crossed helical fiber array that wraps the dolphin's axial locomotor muscles. If such a sheath has uniform material properties, it will respond uniformly to imposed forces. In dolphins, the morphology of the SDS is not constant along the length of the animal. The SDS anterior to the dorsal fin is less than 0.6 mm thick and formed by two layers of loosely interwoven collagen fibers (predominant fiber angles 45-51 ?). The SDS posterior to the dorsal fin is greater than 1.2 mm thick and formed by three layers of tightly interwoven collagen fibers (with varying fiber angles between 43? and 68?). The SDS, made of different materials along its length, is not a typical crossed helical fiber array. This morphological variation suggests re? gional differences in the mechanical behavior of the SDS. Differences in the shrinkage of SDS samples following removal from a fresh dolphin carcass provides a test of the predicted mechanical nonuniformity. The loosely woven anterior region of the SDS shrank approximately 10% more (both circumferentially and longitudinally) than the posterior SDS samples. This result indicates that the anterior region of the SDS is stretchier than the posterior region, but it does not indicate the resting stress and strain and, thus, the subsequent mechanical behavior of these SDS regions in the dolphin. I am running biaxial tensile tests on regions of the SDS to determine their resting stress and strains in situ. These data will show how regions of the SDS respond to the variable forces imposed upon them in a swimming dolphin. 1013 MORPHOLOGICAL AND MECHANICAL ASPECTS OF INTEGUMENTARY AUTOTOMY IN THE GECKO AILURONYX. A.M. Bauer, A.P. Russell and R.E. Shadwick. Villanova Univ., PA. and Univ. of Calgary, Canada. Skin samples of Ailuronyx seychellensis, a gecko that autotomizes large portions of its skin when touched by predators, were compared with those taken from Gekko gecko, which does not exhibit this anti-predator strategy. Whole skin of Gekko had a breaking stress of 17 MPa vs. 1.3 MPa for Ailuronyx. Elastic moduli of the samples were 71 MPa and 7 MPa respec? tively. Fracture energy of Ailuronyx skin is 0.5 kJ/m2 vs. 1.93 kJ/m2 for Gekko. Most of the strength of Ailuronyx whole skin is attributable to the innermost 6% of the dermis which remains attached to the animal when the skin is "sloughed" thus maintaining the immunological integrity of the lizard. Collagen fibers in this layer are heli- cally wrapped (55? to the body axis). Mechanical properties and behavior of the isolated inner dermis of Ailuronyx are comparable to those of Gekko whole skin. The outer dermis in Ailuronyx is interrupted by mesenchymous cores of the tubercular scales of the dorsum, creat? ing predeterrained zones of weakness.</page><page sequence="195">Abstracts 195A 1014 THE SCALING OF SIZE AND STIFFNESS OF PRIMARY FLIGHT FEATHERS. ??* Worcester. Univ. of Utah. The scaiing of stiffness and size of flight feathers is important when considering their role in supporting an airbome bird. Primary flight feathers were taken from birds ranging in body mass from 0.02 to 17.7 kg (House Finch to Andean Condor). Feather length, shaft diameter, and flexural stiffness were related to body mass (M) using the allometric equation, Y=bMa. Condor feathers were 100 times stiffer than finch feathers, but relative to mass, were more flexible (observed a = 0.65, whereas if feathers were scaiing isometrically, a = 1.00). Similarly, the long (58 cm) condor feathers were, relative to body mass, shorter than those of the finch (observed a = 0.28, but for isometry, a = 0.33). Large feathers were relatively more stout than small ones (shaft diameter increased with feather length with an observed a = 0.79, whereas for isometry, a = 1.00). Large birds may compensate for greater forces on the wings during flight by having more flexible supportive structures. 1015 SHEDDING RATE AND RATTLE GROWTH IN TIMBER RATTLESNAKES. W.S. Brown. Skidmore College, Saratoga, N.Y. Shedding rate (sheds/snake/yr) (SR) in natural populations of Crotalus horridus in northern New York allowed rattle growth to be calculated. Rattles were painted and sheds were measured directly by counting unpainted rattle segments. Individuals recaptured (n=419) during 1,031 shedding intervals (snake-years) shed 1,482 times between 1981 and mid-1988. All snakes shed once or twice per year. Mean overall SR was 1.44. Male SR (1.50; 715 sheds/478 intervals) exceeded female SR (1.39; 767 sheds/553 intervals). Ready-to-shed animals (skin pre-shed cloudy or pre-shed clear) were captured chiefly in June, July, and August (58% of 200 males, 38% of 250 females in shedding condition). Effects on SR of body size, female reproductive state, color morph, and year were investigated. Estimating a rattlesnake's age by its rattle size is reliable only if the SR is determined. 1016 TESTIS ULTRASTRUCTURE AND FUNCTION IN INITIAL AND TERMINAL PHASE^MALE WRASSE. T.F. Hourigan, M. Nakamura and Y. Nagahama. National Institute of Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan. As in many wrasses, Thalassoma duperrey populations contain small initial phase (IP) males which spawn in groups, and large terminal phase (TP) males which defend temporary spawning territories and spawn in pairs. IP males have large testes with high sperm production, but few steroid producing Leydig cells. TP males are derived from either IP males or from sex- changed females. Regardless of origin, TP males have much smaller testes with well developed and numerous Leydig cells. TP males have higher plasma levels of 11-ketotestosterone than do IP males. In vitro culture of gonads shows that TP male testes produce larger amounts of 11-ketotestosterone in response to gonadotropin, and convert testosterone to that androgen more efficiently, than do IP male testes. Correlations of higher levels of 11-ketotestosterone with time of spawning suggest a role for that steroid in the spawning behavior or territorial behavior of TP males. 1017 SPERM DISTRIBUTION AND MORPHOLOGY WITHIN THE TURTLE OVIDUCT. Daniel il' Gist and R&gt;. ?, Thurston*. Univ. of Cincinnati and Clemson Univ. The time course of sperm movement in the oviduct of C. picta and ?. scripta was examinecT. Sperm were recovered from the uterine lumen commencing in October and continuing until the turtles entered hibernation in late November. In spring, sperm were absent from the uterine lumen but were found in the storage glands of the tuba. Sperm recovered from the storage glands or the uterus differed from sperm harvested from the epididymis or by electroejaculation in the morphology of the midpiece, possibly involving the orientation of the mitochondria. It is concluded that sperm reside in the uterine lumen for a considerable time following insemination before moving into the storage tubules overwinter. During this interval sperm undergo morphological changes or selection.</page><page sequence="196">196A American Society of Zoologists 1018 LATE-STAGE PLACENTATION IN THE MATROTROPHIC VIVIPAROUS LIZARD CHALCIDES CHALCIPES. D.g. Blackburn. Trinity College, Hartford, CT. Placental morpbology and development bave long been regarded as unique in tbe skink Chalcides chalcidesr based on early anatomical descriptions. Re-exaraination of bistological material originally used in ten Cate-Hoedemaker's 1933 study in- dicates that cytological and histological specializations in this species have been superimposed over a morphogenetic pattern typical of squaraates. Contrary to previous reports, the allantoplacenta is entirely epitheliochorial, and the yolk- sac placenta is a true omphaloplacenta formed frora an avascular bilaminar omphalopleure. Unusual features include exclusion of the allantois frora the yolk cleft, presence of a deciduate placen- tome, and hypertrophy and hyperplasia of epithelia of the placentorae and omphalo? pleure. Some of these features reflect specializations for maternal-fetal nutrient transfer. Placentome morphology is only superficially similar to that of matrotrophic Mabuvaf justifying the recognition of a Type IV placental morph? otype for the latter. I thank the curators of the Embryological Collections at the Hubrecht Laboratorium in Utrecht for making this study possible. 1019 HISTOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS OFTHE EXTRAEMBRYONIC MEMBRANES AND UTERUS INVOLVED WITH PLACENTATION IN TROPIDOCLONION UNEATUM (SERPENTES: COLUBRIDAE). D.C. Baxter. Univ. of Colorado, Boulder. Two placentae form at the embryonic pole during development in Tropidoclonion lineatum. A transitory choriovitelline placenta forms first and is composed of a trilaminar omphalopleure (chorionic ectoderm, vascular mesoderm, endoderm) adjacent to the uterine epithelium. This is soon replaced by the chorioallantoic placenta (chrioallantoic membrane, uterine epithelium) which then persists throughout complete development. At the abembryonic pole, two structurally different placentae form associated with the isolated yolk mass. The isolated yolk mass is a structure unique to squamates, which has not been reported in any other vertebrate. The omphaloplacenta forms first and consists of a bilaminar omphalopleure (chorionic ectoderm, isolated yolk endoderm) apposed to the uterine epithelium. The omphaloplacenta is later replaced by the omphalallantoic placenta (allantois, bilaminar omphalopleure, uterine epithelium) following the extension of the allantois through the yolk cleft. Histologically the chorioallantoic placenta and placentae of the isolated yolk mass appear quite different, thus suggesting that functional differences may exist between embryonic and abembryonic pole placentation. 1020 CAUDAL HEDONIC GLANDS IN SALAMANDERS OF THE EURYCEA BISLINEATA COMPLEX. D. M. Sever and N. L. Reagan. Saint Mary's College, Notre Dame, IN, and Univ. Chicago, Chicago, IL. Male Eurycea bislineata, IS. cirrigera, _E. junaluska, JE. wilderae, and morph A of Sever, possess a cluster of acinar exocrine glands in the skin of the middorsal tail base that is absent in females of the species. These glands secrete a mucoprotein during the breeding season. During courtship, females place their head so that their nasolabial grooves are oriented dorsal to the,tail base. Since this tail stradle by the female Is stereotyped for plethodontid courtship, caudal hedonic glands may occur widely in other genera in the family. The secretion of these glands may encourage females to remain astride the male's tail during the relatively lengthy time necessary for spermatophore deposition. 1021 EFFECTS OF MALATHION ON THE LIVER CELLS AND SERUM PROTEINS OF BLUEGILL LEPOMIS MACROCHIRUS. C. Richmonds and H. M. Dutta. Kent State Univ., Kent, OH Histopathological changes of the liver cells and changes in the serum proteins were studied to evaluate the effects of a sub-lethal dose of malathion. The techniques employed were histology and electrophoresis. After 24 hours of exposure to 0.05 ppm malathion necrosis was observed in the liver cells. Small vacuoles were noticed in the cells. Nuclei were either pushed towards the periphery of the cell or completely lost. Forty-eight hours of exposure showed large vacuoles and many ruptured cells. Shrinkage of nuclear material was observed after 72 hours of expoBure. Severe necrosis and loss of a large number of nuclei were seen after 96 hours of exposure. Changes in the amount and mobility of different serum proteins were observed after varying periods of exposure to 0.05 ppm malathion.</page><page sequence="197">Abstracts 197A 1022 MORPHOLOGICAL SPECIALIZATIONS FOR HERBIVORY IN SMALL LIZARDS: THE GENUS LIOLAEMUS. K. Trover. U.S. National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington D.C. Herbivory in terrestrial vertebrates entails nearly universal modifications of dentition and digestive tract structure, for shearing plant structural tissues and fermenting the fibrous components of these materials. Within the reptiles, herbivory is also associated with large body size: most herbivorous species of lizards, for example, veigh over lOOg. Although quite small in body size (5-20g), several species within the lizard genus Liolaemus consume substantial quantities of leaves and demonstrate specializations for herbivory typical of much larger herbivores. Diet composition and morphological specialization for herbivory were quantified in 22 species of Liolaemus, using museum specimens. Within this sample, with species ranging from exclusively insectivorous to primarily herbivorous, flattening of the dentition and enlargement of the hindgut were significantly correlated with proportion of leafy material in the diet. Therefore, even closely related lineages may diverge substantially in both diet and digestive anatomy. 1023 LUNG VENTILATION IN IGUANA IGUANA: AN ACTION OF TONIC MUSCLE. D.R. Carrier. Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor. In green iguanas, expiratory airflow is driven by increased thoracic pressure that results from caudal displacement of the ribs. Subatmospheric, inspiratory, pressure results from cranial rotation of the ribs. Electromyography shows that although the external and internal intercostal muscles are the main agonists of inspiration, neither is involved in expiration. This observation conflicts with the hypothesis that the different fiber orientations of the two muscles determine their ventilatory function. Instead, the direction that the intercostal muscles rotate the ribs seems to be controlled by the relative resistance of the ribs to anterior versus posterior displacement. During inspiration, EMG activity is restricted to the medial sides of the two intercostal muscles. However, the frequency of this electrical activity is unusually low (&lt;100 hz). Muscle fibers from this region have multiple motor endplates and exhibit tonic contraction when immersed in saline solutions of high potassium content. The transversalis and retrahentes costarum muscles are the main agonists of expiration. They also produce only low frequency EMG signals during ventilation and contain fibers with multiple motor endplates. Thus, although breathing is a phasic activity, it is produced by tonic muscle fibers. (Support from NSF DEB 8509490, C. Gans). 1024 MONKEY LIPS, RABBIT EARS, AND DOLPHIN NOSES. Ted W. Cranford. Institute of Marine Sciences, University of California, Santa Cruz. Pouchet and Beauregard (1885) coined the term "museau de singe" for a structure in the distal right air passage of the sperm whale because it resembles the lips of a monkey. Schenkkan and Purves (1973) noted similar structures bilaterally placed in the spiracular cavity of a dol? phin and proposed that they are homologs to the monkey lips of the sperm whale. Cranford (1986) reported that the forehead of the spinner dolphin contained two pairs of fatty structures, the dorsal bursae, which resemble the ears of a rabbit. In 1972 Norris and Harvey proposed a sound generation mechanism which pushes air past the pucker of the sperm whale's monkey lips. After noting anatomic similarities between dolphins and sperm whales, Cran? ford et al. (1987) proposed that all odon- tocetes produce their sonar signals by a mechanism similar to that proposed by Norris and Harvey. The anatomic confi? guration of the odontocete forehead will be demonstrated using various medical imaging data sets. Preliminary histologi? cal preparations identified a small car- tilagenous rod embedded in the soft tissue just behind the rabbit ears. Possible implications for sound production are dis? cussed.</page><page sequence="198">AUTHOR INDEX Paper #</page><page sequence="199">Abstracts 199A Paper #</page><page sequence="200">200A American Society of Zoologists Paper #</page><page sequence="201">Abstracts 201A Paper # F&amp;per #</page><page sequence="202">202A American Society of Zoologists Paper # Raper #</page><page sequence="203">Abstracts 203A Raper # Paper #</page><page sequence="204">204A American Society of Zoologists F&amp;per # Paper #</page><page sequence="205">Abstracts 205A Paper #</page><page sequence="206">206A American Society of Zoologists F&amp;per ?
