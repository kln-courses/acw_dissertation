<plain_text><page sequence="1">Djuka Women and Men's Art JEHANNE TEILHET-FISK The Maroon men of Suriname are famous for their intri- cately carved secular objects,art forms mainly presented to women as gifts in courtship and marriage. Scholars such as Price (1970, 1980), Herskovits (1966), Hurault (1970) and Crowley (1956) have given much attention to the carvings, but little to the part that women play in their creation. Women are not simply passive recipients of these gifts; they are consumers, critics, connoisseurs, and collaborators, and are so acknowledged by male artists. My purpose here is to explore the roles of Maroon men and women in the art-making process and to compare them with their better-known counterparts in West Africa.1 This paper is based on a collection of field interviews with the Djuka who live on the banks of the Marowijne and Tapanahoni rivers.2 The Djuka are one of the six Maroon cultures descended from escaped plantation slaves who won their freedom in the mid-18th century.3 The Maroons built their villages far from major towns along the only transportation route of the interior jungle, the principal rivers, and until recently chose to remain relatively isolated. They developed their own social structures and artistic forms, which seem partially to reflect their West Af- rican antecedents.4 The Maroon carving tradition began over a hundred years ago (Price &amp; Price 1980:123). Most men carved, the better artists hav- ing positions of honor and status. Such positions were attained not by making the formal hieratic arts of religio-political impor- tance, as is the case in most West African societies, but by mak- ing secular arts primarily for women and occasionally for them- selves and other men. A Djuka man can have several wives. For each he builds a house traditionally embellished with designs that are carved or painted or both. In the past he would hunt, fish, and clear the land for his wives' gardens, but now many of the men work in Paramaribo, the capital of Suriname. A wife is more like a part- ner than a subordinate. She bears the man's children, tends the crops, cooks, and sews, and she may share her home with him even though he has his own house. Divorce is a casual affair. One of the customary ways a man maintains a stable relation- ship is by giving his girl friend or wife beautiful utilitarian woodcarvings such as combs, winnowing trays, stools, food stirrers, canoe prows, and paddles. When not in use, these or- nate objects decorate the house facade. The women say they place them there because they are pleasing to the eye; in addi- tion they signal to all passersby the woman's material wealth and status. In appreciation of these gifts, she will usually give the man decorated calabashes, embroidered cloth, or sewn tex- tiles. Built into this system of courtship art is continual striving on the part of the man to find innovative ways to express his affection through the carvings. As a result the stylistic elements and motifs reflect social change, popular fashion, and new technology, as well as both genders' changing notions of aesthe- tic codes. In contrast, the important visual manifestations of Maroon deities reflect less stylistic change and lack the fine and detailed workmanship that is usually apparent both in decorative forms there and in the hieratic scuptures of West African cultures from which Maroon cultures in part derive. Given the universal importance of hieratic art forms,I asked why Djuka men expend so comparatively little artistic energy upon their deity images. Amoja Kwasie replied, "The gods, gadu, do not like the intricate cuti-cuti (decorative embellishments). They do not want it!"5 The abodes for or symbols of their deities range from simple prayer poles to highly stylized anthropomorphic carvings. The forms are whitewashed with sacred kaolin (pemba dotee) and adorned with offerings of white or multicolored strip cloth. Store-bought paint is never used on the gods: "That is the law. The gods do not like paint.6 Though simply represented, the gods, ancestors, and spirit forces continue to play an integral part in the life of the Djuka. The absence of fine craftsmanship and design elements is not a sign of indifference or neglect. The cloths-often quite A DJUKA WOMAN POSES IN FRONT OF HER HOUSE, HOLDING A COMB SHE RECEIVED AS A GIFT FROM HER HUSBAND. 63</page><page sequence="2">elaborate-sacred kaolin, bottles, and other objects on or around these images stand as testimony of their vital participa- tion in the society. Kaptem Plama explained: "These things show that we accept and pray to the gods.It is the way everyone thanks the gods." He added: "Cuti-cuti means nothing to the gods because they are strong. The ghosts of men are stronger than those of women. The power of the male ghost is very strong; it doesn't need cuti-cuti. Cuti-cuti means more to women. "7 It is plausible, given the distinction made by men, that the dif- ference in style and craftsmanship between the hieratic and nonhieratic arts indicates that the god figures do not reflect the aesthetic sensibilities or, indeed, the concerns of women.8 The implication is that cuti-cuti, though appreciated by men, be- longs more to the realm of women, and is associated with the arts that are subjected to female aesthetic criteria. According to Philip Dark, "Women are evidently highly gifted connoisseurs of the art of carving and appreciate a new piece that is excel- lently executed" (1954:50). Dark did not make the specific point that women are thus critics, nor did he confront the issue of women as collaborators. In traditional West African societies, men are the explicit crit- ics and connoisseurs of all the major visual forms they create. Whereas women in some cultures (Yoruba, Senufo, Mende, Akan) are surely critics as well, directing and in some cases sanctioning the efforts of male carvers, they seem to play a more THE ABODES FOR OR SYMBOLS OF DEITIES RANGE FROM SIMPLE PRAYER POLES TO STYLIZED ANTHROPOMORPHIC CARVINGS.

As opposed to the situation in Suriname, men who are artists in West Africa earn this position of stature mainly by making hieratic art, which by its ideological nature, symbolic structure, and marked religio-political mes- sages constrains innovation.9 In some societies, such as the Akan to whom Maroon artists are often compared, they may also gain recognition by carving secular objects for women, like combs, fans, and stools. Maroon arts have a system of nonverbal communication simi- lar to those found in many West African cultures: they are usu- ally addressed to women, who as recipients are members of the congregation and will understand the meaning encoded in them. This is true of Akan combs,10 Igbo spoons, and other such items made by West African male artists for women. The Maroon objects are embellished with formal elements that, for the most part, communicate the carver's or patron's love, admi- ration, or desire for a woman. "The designs say hello. The man is telling the woman how much he feels about her.""' Some of the elements are symbolic, some are descriptive, some exist just for aesthetic reasons. When asked if women gave them ideas for the carvings, most Djuka men replied that a woman would never help them with the design. Men get their designs from "the brain, how you are smart-that is the way you are going to work. If you don't have enough brains, you're not going to make the designs beauti- ful."12 They acknowledged that they learned how to carve many of the designs by watching other artists work and by copying older patterns. I asked what happens when a woman does not like a carving made for her. The reply was uniform: she would not accept it, and the man would keep it or give it to another woman or to a relative. However, if the carver liked the woman, 64</page><page sequence="3">he would make her another piece---the way she wanted it. "If she says she doesn't like it too well, then I will say, what your heart likes, that is what you have to explain to me, and then I will make you that."13 Even the most general common response indicates that women play a more or less active role in designing objects they receive as presents from their men. Amoja Kwasie was the only man I interviewed who went further, saying that "women, they got more in ideas of design than men; then they tell the men and the men make it on their own. Not all women have ideas, but those that do tell the men. Some women no sabe. And if woman doesn't like the design, she sends it back and he will make a better one."14 Kwasie's statement makes clear the woman's (at least occasional) role as collaborator, connoisseur, and even innovator. It was confirmed by the women in different ways. Afineah said that she gives her husband ideas. "He sees if I have a reason for saying so, and if he sees the reason then he will change the design; if it is not a good reason he won't." She said this is true of most women. 15 Ahnaysa told me: "If I don't like what he carves I can tell him what I like. If he can't do it he will pay someone to carve it for me. And if I see something I like---a comb-and the other woman wants to sell it, I will buy it. 16 According to Annana: "If I see something of my friend's and I want it, I bring my man and show him what I like; then he makes it for me. If he can't carve he will try to buy it for me.1"" Thus Djuka woodcarvings are informed with women's aesthetic preferences. I asked why the more recent carvings lack the intricate openwork of older examples and rely more heavily on bright contrasting colors to carry the design. 1, The reply further illustrates the influence of women. The men said that before the "great war" color was used to complement the carv- ings. After World War II the women began visiting Paramaribo. "The women saw painted houses. They liked the bright col- ors."19 Kaptem Plama said, "If you make something for a woman and you don't paint it, she doesn't like it."20 As painted objects became more fashionable, openwork designs were carved less often. The men told me that painting was easier and faster, but that it was also expensive. Some complained that the government people who sold the paint overcharged them. Yet the very fact that paint had to be purchased and shipped up river from the city added to its prestige. Now, however, many of the younger women do not want de- signs either painted or carved on the facades of their houses. "Maybe," Kaptem Plama added, "you will paint something on the door, but they see modern houses in Parmaribo and that is what they want. The women in the past seldom went to the city. But nowadays they go into Paramaribo and see things, so they don't have any feelings about the old days when men carved gifts for them. Now they want modern things of enamel, glass, tin, and the like, not woodcarvings." An older woman con- curred: "Women do not look carefully at the carvings the boys make. The women do not care about the carvings today. In my day the men had more time and patience to make the carvings; nowadays they make the carvings to sell to the tourists for money."21 Ahanan said: "In my time when the men made carv- ings it meant something; it had a message that women under- stood. But now it doesn't mean anything. I like the carvings from my time because the men carved more carefully.22 These statements reflect the loss of an art form. There are few men left in the Djuka villages today; most have gone to work in Paramaribo or on the French side of the river. At the end of the year they return laden with store-bought gifts. The men remain home for a week or two, and if they have nothing to do they may carve a comb, paddle, or bench to give to their women. There are a number of young men who live along the road to the airport, outside Paramaribo, where they make and sell their OANOCEANIE-AFRIQUE NOIRE PRIMITIVE ART BOOK SPECIALISTS BOX 85, ANCRAM, NEW YORK 12502 Mail Order Telephone Sales Tel. 518 325-5400 OCEANIC PRIMITIVE ARTS 88 EAST 10TH STREET, NEW YORK 10003 2nd floor By Appointment Only, Friday and Saturday Tel. 212 982-8060 65</page><page sequence="4">carvings; not one of them is Djuka.23 They said they carve be- cause it is the only work they can get, and they felt that it is a lowly occupation. Women will make some suggestions regard- ing their work, but the carvers must now listen to what the tourists say, as they are becoming the new critics and consum- ers. According to Amasi, a Saramaka, the tourists prefer certain designs, like sun motifs and double spirals.24 Amasi was one of the few who enjoyed his work. He liked being his own boss and believed that the Europeans appreciate his carvings. "Some local people will buy my work, but the rich and the tourists will buy more. The local people do not appreciate this work; they think it is low work." Most of these carvers along the airport road told me they would quit without hesitation if they could find a better-paying job with more status. It is not like the old days when carving was considered "the most important job.'"25 Both Jean Hurault, who worked with the Aluku of French Guiana, and Richard Price, who worked with the Saramaka, have divided these carving traditions into stylistic periods. (Hurault 1970: 84-119; Price &amp; Price 1980: 96-102). The fact that they can catalogue the styles temporally indicates how much change and innovation are characteristic of these arts. Both studies reveal that there are external as well as internal factors that influence stylistic preferences, but neither study makes explicit the effect that Maroon women have on the art styles of Suriname. In most traditional cultures, women play an equivocal role in the arts (Teilhet 1978:96-102). They cannot work in hard materi- als26 or use specialized tools or technology and they are rarely MONIE LIVES ALONG THE ROAD TO THE AIRPORT, OUTSIDE PARAMARIBO, WHERE HE MAKES AND SELLS HIS CARVINGS HE IS HOLDING A DECORATIVE PLAQUE AND HORN, WHICH HE HOPES TO SELL TO TOURISTS. allowed to make figurative images. And while there is a great variation in women's ability to achieve a respected political and economic status, this appears to have little or no effect upon their capability to extend their production of art. For example, no one questions the religio-political and economic importance of women in the Bundu society of Sierra Leone; yet, although women collaborate by taking a critical role as in Djuka culture, it is men who make that women's society's ritual art forms, such as the soweri. This limited access to the art arena holds true for Maroon women as well. They work with soft media: calabashes, weav- ing fibers, and embroidery materials (Price &amp; Price 1980:47-95, 150-65). Because the designs made on calabashes are scraped and incised, I repeatedly asked both genders whether women carve. The consistent reply was no. "Why not?" "They won't be able to do it." "But," I would argue, "don't they carve calabashes with a knife or a piece of glass?" "Yes, they can make something on the calabashes, but to make combs, tables, and things, they won't be able. It is too hard." Again I asked, "Do they carve a calabash with a knife?" "Yes, but this knife is not so sharp as the one the carver uses. It is a woman's knife for cook- ing."27 "But if a woman can carve a calabash, why can't she carve a piece of wood?" "Carving wood is for men, carving calabash is for women. Carving in wood is dangerous to the woman-she can cut herself."28 Most of the Djuka interviewed stressed these points: carving wood is not a woman's job, and women are not strong enough to do it. A few men, such as Kap- tem Plama, expressed the opinion that "women are not smart enough to carve wood. They don't know how to make it, but they know it is nice."29 And one man closed the interview by saying, "God made it this way. Woodcarving is man's work."30 Why women in traditional cultures don't carve wood and why they work predominantly in the less hieratic arts is still a matter of conjecture. I do not believe it is simply a question of male or female preference, nor is it based on physical strength, intelligence, or artistic skill. The generality of the situation indi- cates that the gender difference in the division of artistic prac- tices must reflect some fundamental facet of all social structures, even those, like the Maroons', that developed anew. Certainly, common links one must pursue are the cultural notions con- cerning women's progenitive powers, which give rise to certain constraints on their artistic activities, as well as genetic and per- ceptual factors. Though social structures differ, behavioral pat- terns change, and rules that bring order and clarity to a culture are bent or are broken, this division of artistic labor among men and women remains relatively unchanged. The body of cross-cultural data on the role and status of women exceeds that which is catalogued and available for refer- ence. This paper attempts to contribute to the cross-cultural studies on the types of dominant roles women can play in the visual arts and to provide some insights into gender differences and restrictions in artistic activities. In essence, the Djuka women are a fitting capstone in the study of women's relation- ship to men's art. They developed an eye for what they liked, and as the major consumer they influenced the making of the decorative and largely secular arts.Their role was significant: the aesthetic quality kept pace with the importance the women placed upon it. "But the women today want modern things. They do not look carefully at the carvings the boys make. The women do not care about the carvings today."31 Among the Djuka, carving as courtship art is on the way out, and with it goes the recognition of the artists, for these men are losing the support of their critics, consumers, and connoisseurs-the women. O Notes, page 91 66</page><page sequence="5">TEILHET-FISK, notes, from page 66 I wish to thank Herbert Cole for his insightful comments and criticism on previous drafts of this article, as well as for giving me some additional data on the Akan of Ghana. Wim Gooswit of Paramaribo was my chief interpreter, friend, and mentor. With his help I have translated the in- terviews into idiomatic English; we have taken grammatical liberties, but the content remains accurate. Though I quote a single person in the article, the interviews always at- tracted a number of people who would affirm or dispute the quoted informant. In most cases I agreed not to put a person's name in the captions. Finally, I am most grateful to the Djuka people for their hospitality, sense of humor, and patience, particularly my friends in the village of Godoholo. 1. It is necessary when referring to West African women and their relationship with the visual arts to acknowledge the studies of several authors. Glaze's "Women Power and Art in a Senufo Village" (1975) and recent Art and Death in a Semnufo Village (1981) are critical works that bring into sharp focus the issues, relationships, and typological divisions between women, art, and social structures. Thompson's portrait of a woman artist (1969) stands as a classic; more studies of this nature are needed. Other authors whose ideas have affected the study of women in art are David W. Ames, Paula Ben-Amos, Jean Borgatti, Ken Gourlay Freida High-Wasikhongo, Arnold Rubin, and Roslyn Walker. 2. In the summers of 1975 and 1978 I traveled up the Marowijne and Tapanahoni rivers and visited a number of Djuka villages. 3. In 1975 Suriname, a Dutch colony in South America, re- ceived its independence. 4, There is controversy regarding the extent to which Afri- can antecedents account for Suriname arts in style, motif, and function. A number of scholars (e.g., Thompson, Herskovits, Fagg, Volders, and Bastide) have taken an "Af- ricanist" approach to the art and culture of the Suriname Maroons, whereas the Prices counter this approach. The is- sues are complex, and the Prices have certainly forced one to re-analyze the stylistic evidence, but more attention must also be given to the hieratic forms of art, which are more meaningful and less subject to-ehange. (For further reading on this issue see Crowley 1981: 16-17). 5. Sept. 12, 1978. Amoja Kwasie is approximately seventy years old; he is a respected member of the village of Godoholo. 6.

This existence of two different art styles reflects Boas' no- tion that a sexual division of labor must also be considered in regard to stylistic difference. He also noted that artists divided within a society by sex or craft may develop dis- tinct styles, just as isolated subtribes do (Boas 1955: 180-82). 9. "Under different situations, inventive variations can and do occur, but in the main, the ritualized art process con- strains innovation and free self-expression. Hieratic art emphasizes repetition and encourages clever and ingenious manipulation of iconographic elements within a given ico- nography (Teilhet 1978: 10).. 10. Djuka and Akan women are the recipients, users, and wearers of the comb. The Akan comb, according to Antiri, traditionally has an elaborate system of encoding nonverbal messages. In addition to being carriers of proverbs, myths, and symbols, the combs reveal and reinforce a woman's status, power, clan, ntoro, and even her attractiveness to suitors as indicated by the quantity of combs she wears in her hair (Antiri 1974: 32-35). This fine study would have been enhanced by documentation of who is signaling what, to whom, and when. Is there a difference between the combs a woman commissions and those a man gives her as a gift? What is the set of criteria that determines which comb or combs she will wear from day to day? Compara- tive questions asked of Djuka women elicited polite re- sponses that indicated that the levels of meaning no longer exist. 11. Kaptem Bonte Prima, Loabi, Aug. 1975.

Amasi, a 46-year-old Saramaka, Aug. 1978. He learned to carve when he could not get any construction work. 25. Monie, a 38-year-old Saramaka, Aug. 1978. Monie once worked at the saw mill. I asked him why he chose to work as a woodcarver, and he replied, "There were not sufficient jobs for everybody I couldn't get a job. I did not want to starve from hunger and that is how I came to this job." 26. Indeed, Herbert Cole and Ernie Wolfe have separately documented women as woodcarvers, albeit of secular domestic containers. Antiri states that on rare occasions Akan women carve combs (1974), and Walker notes that women carvers have been reported in the Wakemba society (1976). Women as carvers are rare and appear to be a con- temporary phenomenon. 27. Kaptem Alfisie, a respected elder in his sixties, Godoholo, Sept. 14, 1978. 28. Amoja Kwasie, Godoholo, Sept. 12, 1978. 29.

In West Africa certain cosmology clearly ordains the privilege of carving to men. Some oral traditions relate how women were the initial creators of ritual forms, but they abused the prerogative, and the gods gave men the rights. There are so many restrictions against women working in hard materials and hieratic art forms that it is logical to conclude that they once must have tried.
