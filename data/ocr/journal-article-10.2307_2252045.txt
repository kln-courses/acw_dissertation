<plain_text><page sequence="1">IIL,-PROFESSOR TILLICH'S CONFUSIONS BY PAUL EDWARDS 1. Anthropomorphic and Metaphysical Conceptions of God THERE is a tendency among believers, especially those who are professional philosophers, to make God as unlike human beings as possible. The opposite tendency, of regarding God as very much like a human being, only wiser, kinder, juster, and more powerful, is also, of course, quite common. In Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, the believers in God, Demea and Cleanthes, are spokesmen for these two positions respectively. " His ways ", remarks Demea, " are not our ways. His attri- butes are perfect, but incomprehensible." " When we mention the supreme Being ", it may indeed be " more pious and respect- ful " to retain various of the terms which we apply to human beings, but in that case we " ought to acknowledge, that their meaning is totally incomprehensible; and that the infirmities of our nature do not permit us to reach any ideas, which in the least correspond to the ineffable sublimity of the divine attri- butes ".1 Cleanthes denounces Demea and those who share his views as " atheists without knowing it " (ibid. p. 159). He maintains that the divine mind must be regarded as a mind in the sense in which we speak of human minds, and when we apply such words as " rational " and " good " and " powerful " to the deity we are using them in one or other of their familiar senses-what we say is by no means incomprehensible. I shall refer to views like Demea's as " metaphysical " and to those typified by Cleanthes as " anthropomorphic " theology. If this terminology is adopted then Professor Tillich has to be classified as a metaphysical believer. He is quite emphatic in his rejection of the anthropomorphic position to which he dis- dainfully applies such labels as " monarchic monotheism ". The God of the anthropomorphic believers, Tillich writes, " is a being beside others and as such a part of the whole of reality. He certainly is considered its most important part, but as a part and therefore as subjected to the structure of the whole. He is supposed to be beyond the ontological elements and categories which constitute reality. But every statement subjects him to them. He is seen as a self which has a world, as an ego which is related to a thou, as a cause which is separated from its effect, 1 Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, Kemp Smith ed., p. 156. 192</page><page sequence="2">PROFESSOR TILLICH S CONFUSIONS 193 as having a definite space and an endless time. He is a being, not being itself." 1 No, God is not " a being ". " The being of God is being-itself. . . . If God is a being, he is subject to the categories of finitude, especially to space and substance. Even if he is called the ' highest being ' in the sense of the ' most perfect ' and the ' most powerful ' being this situation is not changed. When applied to God, superlatives become diminutives.... Whenever infinite or unconditional power and meaning are attributed to the highest being, it has ceased to be a being and has become being-itself." 2 God is that " which transcends the world infinitely ". The idea of God is not the idea of " some- thing or someone who might or might not exist " (ST1, p. 205, Tillich's italics). Like Demea, Tillich maintains that the words which we apply to human beings cannot be applied to God in their literal senses since God is so very far removed from anything finite. " As the power of being, God transcends every being and also the totality of beings-the world. . . . Being-itself infinitely transcends every finite being. There is no proportion or graduation between the finite and infinite. There is an absolute break, an infinite ' jump'" (ST, p. 237). There is only one statement that we can make about God in which we use words " directly and properly ", i.e. literally, and that is the statement that " God is being-itself ". This state- ment, it is true, can be elaborated to mean that " God as being- itself is the ground of the ontological structure of being without being subject to this structure himself. He is the structure; that is, he has the power of determining the structure of every- thing that has being. . .. If anything beyond this bare asser- tion is said about God, it no longer is a direct and proper state- ment " (ST1, p. 239). Tillich does indeed in various places say such things as that God is Love or that God is living. But these, as well as any other statements ascribing characteristics to God, must be treated as " metaphorical or symbolic " 3 utterances. " Any concrete assertion about God ", Tillich makes it clear, " must be symbolic, for a concrete assertion is one which uses 1 The Courage To Be (from now on referred to as CB), p. 184. 2 Systematic Theology, Vol. 1 (to be referred to as ST), p. 235. 3 CB, p. 179. When making admissions of this kind, Tillich seems to use " symbolic ", " metaphorical ", and " analogous " interchangeably and I shall also follow this practice. It is fair to add that in discussing the history of religious ideas Tillich uses " symbol " in other ways also. For a critical discussion of Tillich's various uses of this word, see W. Alston's " Tillich's Conception of the Religious Symbol ", in S. Hook (ed.), Religiou8 Experience and Language, New York University Press, 1961.</page><page sequence="3">194 P. EDWARDS: a segment of finite experience in order to say something about him " (AST, p. 239). God, as Being-itself, so far transcends any separate, condi- tioned, finite being that we cannot even properly assert his existence. God is indeed " the creative ground of essence and existence ", but it is " wrong . . . to speak of him as existing ". " God does not exist." God is " above existence " and " it is as atheistic to affirm the existence of God as it is to deny it " (ST', pp. 204-205, 236, 237). It may at first seem pointless for an unbeliever (like myself) to take issue with a philosopher who concedes that " God does not exist ". But Tillich does make other remarks which un- believers would or should oppose. Thus he speaks of the " actu- ality of God " (ST1, p. 239) and he also holds that unlike any contingent, finite entity, Being-itself possesses necessary being (it is not, as we saw, something or someone who might or might not exist) so that, as Sidney Hook has pointed out, " despite Tillich's denial, Being is endowed with a certain kind of exist- ence-that which cannot not be ".1 But in any event, I do not wish to argue that Being-itself does not exist. To do so would presuppose that Tillich's talk about Being-itself is intelligible and this is what I wish to deny. When I say, with certain reservations to be explained below, that Tillich's assertions about Being-itself are unintelligible, I am not merely applying the general positivistic condemnation of metaphysics to this particular system. The war-cry of the early logical positivists that " metaphysics is nonsense " does seem to be open to serious objections. For one thing, it is notoriously difficult to formulate a criterion of meaning which does not rule out either too much or too little and which does not have the appearance of being, in certain respects, arbitrary and question-begging. There can also be no doubt that meta- physical systems are much more complex than some of the enemies of metaphysics believed-frequently they have all kinds of interesting and curious " links " to experience and they are only on the rarest occasions purely " transcendent ". Granting this, it seems to me that the logical positivists nevertheless deserve great credit for helping to call attention to certain features of many sentences (and systems) commonly called " metaphysical ". The metaphysicians are sometimes obscurely, but never, to my knowledge, clearly aware of these features. On the contrary, they manage by various stratagems to hide these features both from themselves and others. When, in non- 1 " The Quest for ' Being' ", Journal of Philo8ophy, 1953, p. 719.</page><page sequence="4">PROFESSOR S TILLICH S CONFUSIONS 195 philosophical contexts, it is found that a sentence possesses one or more of these characteristics, we do not hesitate to call it meaningless. We do not hesitate to say that it fails to assert anything. I propose to show now that many of the most important sentences of Tillich's metaphysical system do possess certain of these features. Since they are put forward not merely as ex- pressions of devout feeling or as vehicles of edifying pictures but as truth-claims, it would be interesting to know why, if they really possess the features in question, they should not be rejected as meaningless. Throughout this article I am using " meaningless ", "un- intelligible ", " devoid of cognitive content ", " failing to make an assertion ", "saying nothing at all ", and " lacking referential meaning " interchangeably. I am aware that, as widely used, not all these expressions have the same meaning or the same force. For example, if I say to a taxi driver, " Go to Amsterdam Avenue and 82nd Street! " this is " intelligible ", it is " meaningful ", it " says something ", but it would not be said to possess " cognitive content-" by those who use this expression at all, we would not say that I used the sentence to make an assertion and most of those who used the word "referent " would say that this sentence, like imperatives generally, was without referential meaning. I do not think that this departure from widespread uses is of any consequence for the purposes of this article, but in any event I would be willing to argue that Tillich's theology is all of the things mentioned-meaningless, unintelligible, and all the rest. 2. Tillich's Theology Is Compatible With Anything Whatsoever We normally regard as empty, as devoid of (cognitive) meaning or content a sentence which, while pretending to assert something, is on further examination found to be compatible with any state of affairs. If, for example, I say " Bomba is going to wear a red tie tonight" and if I do not withdraw my statement even if he shows up wearing a brown or a black or a grey tie, and if it further becomes clear that I will not consider my statement refuted even if Bomba wears no tie at all and in fact that I will consider it " true ", no matter what happens anywhere, then it would be generally agreed that I have really said nothing at all. I have in this context deprived the expression " red tie " of any meaning. I have excluded no conceivable state of affairs</page><page sequence="5">196 P. EDWARDS: and this, in the context in which people are attempting to make factual assertions, is generally considered a sufficient ground for condemning the sentence in question as empty or devoid of content. Now, unless I have misunderstood Tillich, exactly the same is true of his belief in God. However, before showing this, it would be well to bring out as forcibly as possible the enormous difference between Tillich's position and the anthropomorphic theology of Cleanthes and of most ordinary believers. Cleanthes at one stage produces what he calls the " illustration " of the " heavenly voice ". Suppose, he says. " that an articulate voice were heard in the clouds, much louder and more melodious than any which human art could ever reach: Suppose that this voice were extended in the same instant over all nations, and spoke to each nation in its own language and dialect: Suppose, that the words delivered not only contain a just sense and meaning, but convey some instruction altogether worthy of a benevolent Being, superior to mankind." We can make this more definite by supposing that the voice made statements about the cure and prevention of all kinds of illnesses, such as cancer, which are as yet very imperfectly understood, as well as about a large number of other unsolved scientific problems and that upon examination every one of these statements turned out to be true. It is clear that if such a voice were heard, Cleanthes would regard this as confirmation of the existence of God in the sense in which he asserted it. I think it is equally clear that nmost ordinary believers would be jubilant if such events occurred and that they too would regard their belief confirmed. I do not know how Tillich would in fact react to such events, but I know how he should react. The only attitude consistent with his position would be to be (theoretically) wholly indifferent to what hap- pened. The heavenly voice would in no way whatever be a confirmation of his theology. Since heavenly voices do not actually exist, this departure from anthropomorphic theology may not seem to be to Tillich's disadvantage. His position, moreover, may seem to possess a considerable advantage over that of believers in an anthropo- morphic God who is declared to be all-powerful and perfectly good. It has often been shown that the existence of evil falsi- fies the belief in such a God and it is generally admitted, even by those who stick to this belief, that the fact of evil presents a ticklish problem. Tillich's theology, however, is immune to any such attack. Since he does not maintain either that God is all- powerful, in the literal sense, or that he is all-good, in the literal</page><page sequence="6">PROFESSOR TILLICH S CONFUSIONS 197 sense, Tillich's theology does not imply that there is no evil in the world, in any of the ordinary senses of the word. In fact, even if the world were immensely more full of evil than it is, if it were such a frightful place that Nazi concentration camps and cancer hospitals would be regarded, by comparison, as utopian places of health and happiness and justice-even such a state of affairs would in no way falsify Tillich's vi4ew. Being-itself, i.e. God, would still be " actual ". The same would hold for any other aspect of the world. Whether human beings discover more and more order in the world or not, whether future scientific developments show space to be finite or infinite or neither, whether new observations confirm the steady-state theory of Hoyle and Bondi or the " bing- bang" cosmology of Gamow and Lemaitre-it all makes no difference: Being-itself would still be actual. Being-itself, as we noted, is not " something or someone who might or might not be ". This may be true of the anthropomorphic deity, but not of Being-itself. I hope that my point is clear now. Tillich's theology is indeed safe from anti-theological arguments based on the existence of evil, but only at the expense of being compatible with anything whatever. All of us normally regard this, as I tried to show, as a reason for calling a sentence meaningless or devoid of cognitive content. 3. Being-itself and Irreducible Metaphors As we saw, Tillich readily admits that only in the basic state- ment of his system are all words used in their literal senses. All other statements about Being-itself are " symbolic " or " meta- phorical ". Tillich not only repeatedly makes general statements to this effect, he also tells us on many, though not on all, occasions when he discusses the characteristics of Being-itself that the words he uses in characterizing the Ultimate Reality are not to be understood literally. Thus he writes, " If one is asked how nonbeing is related to being-itself, one can only answer meta- phorically: being ' embraces ' itself and nonbeing. Being has nonbeing ' within' itself as that which is eternally present and eternally overcome in the process of the divine life" (CB, p. 34). Again: " In a metaphorical statement (and every assertion about being-itself is either metaphorical or symbolic) one could say that being includes nonbeing but nonbeing does not prevail against it. 'Including' is a spatial metaphor which indicates</page><page sequence="7">198 P. EDWARDS that being embraces itself and that which is opposed to it, non- being. Nonbeing belongs to being, it cannot be separated from it " (CB, p. 179). Again: "The divine life participates in every life as its ground and aim. God participates in everything that is; he has community with it; he shares in its destiny. Certainly such statements are highly symbolic. . . . God's participation is not a spatial or temporal presence. It is meant not categorically but symbolically. It is the parousia, the ' being with ' of that which is neither here nor there. If applied to God, participation and community are not less symbolic than indi- vidualization and personality " (ST, p. 245). And again : "But in God as God there is no distinction between potentiality and actuality. Therefore, we cannot speak of God as living in the proper or nonsymbolic sense of the word ' life ' " (ST, p. 242). Tillich sees nothing at all wrong in his constant employment of metaphors. On the contrary, he stresses the fact that without employing terms taken from " segments of finite experience ", theological sentences would have little or no emotional force. "Anthropomorphic symbols ", he writes, " are adequate for speaking of God religiously. Only in this way can he be the living God for man " (ST, p. 242). Tillich is indeed aware of the objection of certain philosophers that it is illegitimate to use terms which have a reasonably well-defined meaning in everyday contexts to make assertions about a reality that is infinitely re- moved from the contexts in which these expressions were origin- ally introduced. He dismisses this objection without much ado. Such " accusations are mistaken ", Tillich replies, " they miss the meaning of ontological concepts. . . . It is the function of an ontological concept to use some realm of experience to point to characteristics of being-itself which lie above the split between subjectivity and objectivity and which therefore cannot be expressed literally in terms taken from the subjective or the objective side. They must be understood not literally but analo- gously." This, however, Tillich insists, " does not mean that they have been produced arbitrarily and can easily be replaced by other concepts. Their choice is a matter of experience and thought, and subject to criteria which determine the adequacy or inadequacy of each of them " (CB, p. 25). The rejoinder that "of course " the terms in question are used " analogously ", " symbolically" or " merely as metaphors " exercises the same hypnotic spell over Tillich as it has on meta- physicians in the past. He seems to think that it is a solution of the problem. In fact, however, it is nothing of the sort. It is an implicit admission that a problem exists. The concession</page><page sequence="8">PROFESSOR TILLICH S CONFUSIONS 199 by an author that he is using a certain word metaphorically is tantamount to admitting that, in a very important sense and a sense relevant to the questions at issue between metaphysicians and their critics, he does not mean what he says. It does not automatically tell us what he does mean or whether in fact he means anything at all. When Bradley, for example, wrote that " the Absolute enters into . . . evolution and progress ", it is clear that the word " enter " is used in a metaphorical and not a literal sense. But realizing this does not at once tell us what, if anything, Bradley asserted. Often indeed when words are used metaphorically, the context or certain special conventions make it clear what is asserted. Thus, when a certain historian wrote that " the Monroe Doctrine has always rested on the broad back of the British navy ", it would have been pedantic and foolish to comment " what on earth does he mean-doesn't he know that navies don't have backs ? " Or if a man, who has been involved in a scandal and is advised to flee his country, rejects the advice and says, " No, I think I'll stay and face the music ", it would be absurd to object to his statement on the ground that it is not exactly music that he is going to hear. In these cases we know perfectly well what the authors mean although they are using certain words meta- phorically. But we know this because we can eliminate the metaphorical expression, because we can specify the content of the assertion in non-metaphorical language, because we can supply the literal equivalent. The examples just cited are what I shall call" reducible meta- phors ". I prefer this to the phrase " translatable metaphor" because of certain ambiguities in the use of " translatable ". We sometimes say of the English version of a foreign original- e.g. of the Kalisch version of the Rosenkavalier-that it is a bad or inadequate translation although it does in fact reproduce all the truth-claims contained in the original. Conversely we some- times, as in the case of the Blitzstein version of the Dreigroschen- oper, speak of a magnificent translation although we know that not all truth-claims of the original have been reproduced. In the present context, however, we are exclusively concerned with reproduction of truth-claims and in calling a metaphor " reduc- ible " all I mean is that the truth-claims made by the sentence in which it occurs can be reproduced by one or more sentences all of whose components are used in literal senses. Now, Tillich and many other metaphysicians fail to notice the difference between metaphors which are reducible in the sense just explained and those which are not. When a sentence</page><page sequence="9">200 P. EDWARDS: contains an irreducible metaphor, it follows at once that the sentence is devoid of cognitive meaning, that it is unintelligible, that it fails to make a genuine assertion. For what has happened is that the sentence has been deprived of the referent it would have had, assuming that certain other conditions had also been fulfilled, if the expression in question had been used in its literal sense. To say that the metaphor is irreducible is to say in effect that no new referent can be supplied. It will be instructive to look at an actual case in which a philo- sopher gave this very reason for his accusation that certain state- ments by another philosopher were devoid of meaning. I am referring to Berkeley's attack on Locke's claim that the material substratum " supports " the sense-qualities. Berkeley first pointed to the original context in which the word " support " is introduced, as when we say that pillars sulpport a building. He then pointed out that since, according to Locke, the material substratum is a " something, x, I know not what " whose char- acteristics are unknown and indeed unknowable, and, since, therefore, it is not known to resemble pillars in any way, Locke could not possibly have been using the word " support " in its " usual or literal sense ". " In what sense therefore ", Berkeley went on, " must it be taken ? . . . What that is they (Locke and those who share his view) do not explain." Berkeley then concluded that the sentences in question have "no distinct meaning annexed" 1 to them. Let us consider some possible answers to Berkeley's criticism without in any way implying that Locke himself would have approved of any of them. Perhaps the most obvious answer would be that Locke should never have spoken of the material substratum as an unknowable entity. It should really be under- stood as an aggregate of material particles to which certain adjectives like mass- and velocity-predicates can be applied in their literal senses. Locke's statement that the material sub- stratum supports the sense-qualities can then be translated into some such statement as that the particular " gross " sense- qualities perceived at any moment are, in part, causally depen- dent on the distribution and velocities of the particles in question. On this view there would be no irreducible metaphors in the original sentence. A second line of defence would begin by admitting that the material substratum would be completely unknowable, if sensory observation were the only method of becoming acquainted with objective realities. In fact, however, it would be said, we 1 Principles of Human Knowledge, ?? 16-17.</page><page sequence="10">PROFESSOR TILLICH S CONFUSIONS 201 possess a " super-sensuous " faculty with which we " experience " such realities as material and spiritual substances. We could, if we wanted, introduce a set of terms as the symbols literally referring to the data disclosed by this super-sensuous faculty and we could exchange information about these with all who share in the possession of the faculty. If we call this the " intel- lectual language ", then, so this defence of Locke would run, sentences with metaphors when containing terms from the " sensory level ", can be translated into sentences in the intellectual language which will be free from metaphors. Finally, in view of our later discussion, it is worth looking at a particularly naive and lame answer to Berkeley. A defender of Locke, when confronted with the question " You do not mean ' support' in its literal sense, what then do you mean ? " might say, " I mean that the material substratum holds the sense qualities together ". The answer to this is obvious. " Hold together " is no more used in its literal sense than " support" and hence the difficulty has in no way been removed. Turning now to Tillich's metaphysical theology, it seems per- fectly clear from numerous of his general observations that Being-itself is, even in principle, inaccessible to anybody's observation. In this respect it is exactly like Locke's material substratum. We do not and cannot have a stock of literally meaningful statements about it at our disposal which would serve as the equivalents of Tillich's " symbolic " statements. The metaphors in Tillich's sentences are, in other words, irre- ducible and hence, if my general argument has been correct, the sentences are unintelligible. If Tillich's statements are not to become propositions of physics or psychology or history no way out corresponding to the first of the defences of Locke is feasible. And unlike certain contemporary writers, Tillich does not avail himself of an appeal to mystical experience wbichwould correspond to the second defence. For, if I understand Tillich correctly, he denies that even the mystic experiences Being-itself. The (true) " idea of God ", Tillich writes, " transcends both mysti- cism and the person-to-person encounter".1 As I shall show in a moment, Tillich does avail himself of a line of defence corresponding to the third of the defences of Locke. We already saw, however, that such a defence is altogether futile. It may be said that I have not been fair to Tillich and other I CB, p. 178. T am not sure that I have here correctly understood Tillich. He also seems to be saying the opposite at times-that mystics do have " direct access " to Being-itself. If that is TilHich's position then some of the criticisms which follow would not apply, but it would then be open to a number of other objections.</page><page sequence="11">202 P. EDWARDS: metaphysicians who defend themselves by insisting that they are using certain expressions metaphorically or analogously. It may be said that I have emphasized the negative implications of this admission-that the words in question are not used in their literal senses-without doing justice to its positive impli- cations. For, it may be argued, when it is said that a certain word is used " analogously ", it is implied that the term has a referent, namely a referent which is in some important respect similar to the referent it has when used literally. This objection rests on a confusion. We must here distinguish two possible meanings of the assertion that a certain word is used " analogously ". This may, firstly, mean no more than that the word in question is not used literally. But it may also amount to the much stronger claim that the word has a referent and hence that the sentence in which it occurs is, if certain other conditions are fulfilled, cognitively significant. If " analogously" is used in the former sense, then of course I would not for a moment deny that the relevant words are used analogously in Tillich's sentences and in the sentences of other metaphysicians. But this is an innocuous admission. For to say that the words are used analogously in this sense has no tendency whatever to imply that the sentences in which they occur possess cognitive meaning. If " analogously" is used in the second sense, then, as just observed, it would automatically follow that the sentences are, if other conditions are also fulfilled, cognitively significant; but in that event I would deny that the terms we have discussed are used analogously in Tillich's sentences or in the sentences of other metaphysicians. To put the matter very simply: merely saying that a sentence, or any part of it, has meaning does not by itself give it meaning. Such a claim does not assure us that the sentence is intelligible. Similarly the claim that a sentence has an " analogous " referent is a claim and no more-it may be false. If I say, to use an example given by Sidney Hook,' that the sea is angry, the word " angry " really has a referent which is analogous to its referent when used literally. I can in this case specify the features of the sea to which I am referring when I call it angry and I can also specify the similarities between these features and the anger of human beings. If, however, I say that Being-itself is angry, I could not independently identify the features of Being-itself to which I am supposedly referring. Nor of course could I specify the similarities between the anger of human beings and the putative anger of Being-itself. My claim that " angry " is used analogously in this sentence in a 1 c; The Quest for Being ", o). cit. p. 715.</page><page sequence="12">PROFESSOR TILLICH S CONFUSIONS 203 sense in which this implies that it has a referent would be false or at any rate baseless. The narcotic effect of such phrases as " symbolic language " or " analogous sense " is only a partial explanation of Tillich's failure to be clear about the irreducibility of his metaphors. To tell the whole story one has to take notice of an aspect of Tillich's philosophizing which I have so far ignored. What I have so far brought out may be called Tillich's "modest " side- "modest " because he does not in the passages in question claim any literal knowledge about Being-itself. But there is also what may be called Tillich's " dogmatic " side. He then seems to be jotting down in a matter-of-fact way the character- istics of Being-itself, much as a doctor might jot down descrip- tions of the symptoms displayed by a patient. He then writes as if he had a completely unobstructed view of the Ultimate Reality. Thus we are told as a plain matter of fact and without the use of any quotation marks that " God is infinite because he has the finite (and with it that element of non-being which belongs to finitude) within himself united with his infinity ". The expression " divine life ", we are told, points to "this situation " (ST, p. 252, my italics). " The divine life ", Tillich admits, " is infinite mystery ", but we can nevertheless say that " it is not infinite emptiness. It is the ground of all abundance, and it is abundant itself" (ST, p. 251). Again, we are told, without the use of any quotation marks, and I do not think their absence is a mere oversight, that God "is the eternal process in which separation is posited and is overcome by re- union " (ST, p. 242). In one place, to give one more illustration of the dogmatic side of his philosophy, Tillich discusses the question of whether will or intellect are dominant " in God ". He quotes the rival views of Aquinas and Duns Scotus and he notes that Protestants have tended to favour the latter position which subordinates the intellect. Tillich easily resolves this dispute as if he were reading off the truth by a quick glance at God. " Theology ", he writes, " must balance the new with the old (predominantly Catholic) emphasis on the form character of the divine life " (S1, p. 248), i.e. it must assign equal rank to will and intellect in God. The divine life, we are assured, " in- escapably unites possibility with fulfilhment. Neither side threatens the other nor is there a threat of disruption" (ST, p. 247). Tillich, the dogmatist, does not hesitate to offer translations or what I have called reductions of his " symbolic " statements about God. We can also express literally, for example, what we 14</page><page sequence="13">204 P. EDWARDS: mean " symbolically " when we say that God is living. "God lives," the reduction runs, " insofar as he is the ground of life " (ST, p. 242). Again, our symbolic statement that God is per- sonal " does not mean that God is a person. It means that God is the ground of everything personal and that he carries within himself the ontological power of personality " (ST, p. 245). And if we symbolically say God is " his own destiny " we thereby " point to . . . the participation of God in becoming and in history " (ST, p. 249). I wish to make two observations concerning all this. Firstly, although Tillich gives the impression that the metaphors have been eliminated in these and similar cases, this is not so. He never seems to have noticed that even in his basic statement, when elaborated in terms of " ground " and " structure ", these words are used metaphorically and not literally. When Tillich writes that God or Being-itself " is the ground of the ontological structure of being and has the power of determining the structure of everything that has being ", the word " ground ", for example, is clearly not used in any of its literal senses. Being-itself is surely not claimed to be the ground of the ontological structure in the sense in which the earth is the ground beneath our feet or in the sense in which the premises of a valid argument may be said to be the ground for accepting the conclusion. Similar remarks apply to the use of " structure ", "power ", and " deter- mine ". Hence when we are told that "God lives insofar as he is the ground of life " or that " God is personal " means " God is the ground of everything personal and . . . carries within himself the ontological power of personality ", expressions like " ground " and " carry within himself " and even " power " are not used literally. Tillich is here in no better a position than the supporter of Locke who substituted " hold together " for " support ". That Tillich does not succeed in breaking through the circle of expressions lacking literal significance, i.e. lacking referential meaning, is particularly clear in the case of the " translation " of the sentence " God is his own destiny ". By this "symbolic " characterization, as we just saw, we "point " among other things to " the participation of God in becoming and in history ". But a little earlier, in a passage which I also reproduced, we were informed that " God's participation is not a spatial or temporal presence" and twice in the same para- graph we were given to understand that when " applied to God ", participation " is meant not categorically but symbolically". In other words, one metaphorical statement is replaced by another but literal significance is never achieved.</page><page sequence="14">PROFESSOR TILLICH S CONFUSIONS 205 Tillich constantly engages in " circular " translations of this sort. Again and again he " explains " the meaning of one " symbolically " used expression in terms of another which is really no less symbolic. Thus in a passage reproduced at the beginning of section 3 of this article the sentence " being includes nonbeing" which contains the admittedly symbolic word "include " is translated into "nonbeing belongs to being, it cannot be separated from it ". "Belong " and " separate" are no longer put inside quotation marks and one is apt to suppose that some progress has been made. Countless other illustrations of this practice could be given. Secondly, I have the impression that, in spite of his distaste for " monarchic monotheism ", Tillich occasionally relapses into something not too different from it. When offering translations such as those just quoted and generally when assessing the adequacy of certain symbols as " pointers " to the " divine life " Tillich seems to think that he has at his disposal a stock of literal truths about God not too different from those asserted by anthro- pomorphic believers. There is a remarkable passage in which this is strikingly evident: " Religious symbols are double-edged. They are directed toward the infinite which they symbolize and toward the finite through which they symbolize it. They force the infinite down to finitude and the finite up to infinity. They open the -divine for the human and the human for the divine. For instance, if God is symbolized as 'Father', he is brought down to the human relationship of father and child. But at the same time this human relationship is consecrated into a pattern of the divine-human relationship. If' Father' is employed as a sym- bol for God, fatherhood is seen in its theonomous, sacramental depth. . .. If God is called the ' king,' something is said not only about God but also about the holy character of kinghood. If God's work is called 'making whole ' or ' healing,' this not only says something about God but also emphasizes the theo- nomous character of all healing. The list could be con- tinued " (ST, pp. 240-241). Now, if it were known or believed that God is " majestic" in the same sense in which human beings have sometimes been called that, it would make sense to call God a " king " and it would be right to prefer this symbol to symbols like " slave " or c" waiter " or " street-cleaner ". Similarly, if it were known or believed that God is " concerned with the welfare " of all human beings in the literal sense of this expression, then it would make sense to speak of him as our " father " and it</page><page sequence="15">206 P. EDWARDS: would be right to prefer this symbol to symbols like " daughter" or " soprano " or " carpenter ". An anthropomorphic believer has criteria at his disposal in such cases, but Tillich's non- anthropomorphic theology necessarily deprives him of it. Tillich says very correctly that this list of adjectives " could be con- tinued ". Since the " comparison " between fathers and kings on the one hand and the infinitely transcending, infinitely mys- terious, indescribable Being-itself, on the other, is a bogus comparison, God may no less appropriately be said to be a soprano, a slave, a street-cleaner, a daughter, or even a fascist and a hater than a father or a king. 4. Bombastic Redescriptions of Empirical Facts Readers who were less critical than Berkeley did not realize the meaninglessness of the sentence " the material substance supports the sense-qualities " or its equivalents chiefly because of the presence of words like " support " which automatically call up certain images. Similarly, I have no doubt that the presence of such words as " embrace " and " resist " and the mental pictures connected with them prevents many a reader from realizing the meaninglessness of Tillich's talk about being and nonbeing and their mutual relations. But there is also another reason why this unintelligibility is not always obvious. The reason is that, in a certain sense, some of Tillich's sentences are not unintelligible. In this connection I wish to call attention to a technique which is employed by Tillich as well as by many other meta- physicians and certainly by all other existentialists with whose writings I am familiar. I will call it the technique of " bombastic redescription " and I think that one simple illustration will make quite clear what I am referring to. Some well-known chronological facts about Freud may be stated in the following words: Freud was born in 1856 and died in 1939 (1) The very same facts may also be expressed in a much more bombastic fashion: In 1856 Freud migrated from nonbeing to being and then in 1939 he returned from being to nonbeing (2) Now, let us assume for a moment that the author of (2) is not a metaphysician and does not in fact claim that (2) asserts anything over and above what is asserted by (1). In that event, we cannot accuse him of uttering either a meaningless sentence</page><page sequence="16">PROFESSOR TILLICH S CONFUSIONS 207 or a falsehood, since what he says is perfectly intelligible and moreover true, or of performing an illegitimate inference; (2) does follow from (1) no less than for example " some mortal beings are men " follows from " some men are mortal ". We can, however, point out that our author is employing needlessly high-sounding language to express a truth which can be stated much more simply and that (2) does not embody any grand new "insight " into anything whatever. Let us next assume that the author of (2) is a metaphysician who assures us that (2) is not a set of simple biographical state- ments but belongs to " ontology "-the study of " being " and " non-being ". He assures us that (2) asserts a great deal more than (1). In that event we would be entitled to reply, first, that it is not at all clear what, if anything, (2) means now, and secondly, that if it does mean more than (1), the step from (1) to (2) is not warranted. Our ontologist is thus either guilty of making a meaningless pronouncement and of performing an invalid inference or at the very least of the latter. Let us finally assume that we are dealing with an exceedingly nebulous ontologist whose writings hardly ever contain anything that can be dignified as an " argument " or a " definition ". Among his many observations about being and nonbeing he on one occasion includes sentence (2) and somewhere, not too remote in space, there also occurs sentence (1). This nebulous ontologist, unlike the other two people we considered, has not committed himself to any view about the relation between (2) and (1) and, because of this omission, he enjoys the best of two worlds. To certain uncritical readers, (2) will appear to be a profound meta- physical utterance-surely not just a redescription of the familiar facts asserted by (1). At the same time, however, (1) does remain in the background and the pictures aroused by it will tend to be vaguely associated also with (2). It will be felt that it is unfair to accuse the author of " wild speculation " since his ontological statement is " firmly rooted " in experience: after all, Freud was born in 1856 and he did die in 1939. A more critical reader could, however, confront our nebulous ontologist with the following dilemma: either (2) merely asserts what is already asserted by (1)-in that event it is nothing but a bombastic redescription of familiar facts which hardly needed an ontologist or a metaphysician for their discovery, and in that event, furthermore, it is an empirical proposition and its truth is in no way incompatible with empiricism or positivism or any of the doctrines despised by ontologists; or else (2) does assert more-in that event it is not at all clear what, if anything, it</page><page sequence="17">208 P. EDWARDS: d6-es assert and secondly, as already pointed out, in that event it does not follow from (1). In much of what he is doing, Tillich, no less than other exis- tentialists, closely resembles this nebulous ontologist. Like that ontologist he talks grandiloquently about being and nonbeing and he goes even one better in talking about " not-yet-being ". Tillich's observations about being and nonbeing and not-yet- being correspond to sentence (2). Like the ontologist, Tillich also either explicitly mentions certain well-known empirical facts in conjunction with his ontological pronouncements or, when he does not actually mention them, the language chosen nevertheless very strongly tends to call these facts to the reader's mind and, I am pretty certain, to- Tillich's mind also. This would correspond to sentence (1). Finally, like our nebulous ontologist, Tillich leaves the relation between his ontological remarks and the background empirical facts suitably vague. In this way what he says simultaneously enjoys the appearance of being profound, of revealing to us special insights into super- empirical facts-facts about transcendent realms to which science and ordinary observation have no access but too which "existential analysis " holds the clue-and of being quite intelligible and indeed " firmly rooted " in human experience, in the " existential situation ". Tillich is of course open to the same objection as our nebulous ontologist. He cannot, logically, have it both ways: either his ontological talk is merely a bom- bastic iledescription of certain empirical facts which are often trivial and in no instance new; or it is not clear what, if anything, his sentences assert and in any event they are not then war- ranted by any of the empirical facts presented to the reader. I will now give a few illustrations of this procedure. In each case I will first summarize, in bald and untarnished language, the empirical facts of the case whether they are openly mentioned by Tillich or whether they merely hover discreetly in the back- ground. We might refer to this as the cash-value of the doctrine in question. I will then state the' corresponding ontological doctrine and whenever possible I will reproduce Tillich's own words. The reader can judge for himself whether one is justified in confronting Tillich with the dilemma mentioned in the last paragraph. Let us begin with the subject of man's most heroic deeds. Cash-value: Selfishuiess and other unadmirable motives are involved in even the best human actions. Ontological doctrine: "Even in what he considers his best deed nonbeing is present and prevents it from being perfect....</page><page sequence="18">PROFESSOR TILLICH S CONFUSIONS 209 Nonbeing is mixed with being in his moral self-affirmation as it is in his spiritual and ontic self-affirmation (CB, p. 52). Let us turn next to man's " creatureliness ". Cash-value: Human beings have not always existed; all of them are born and before they were born or rather before they were conceived they did not exist; all of them also eventually die, and after they die they are dead, they are not then alive. Ontological doctrine: Nonbeing in man has a dialectical character. Full statement of ontological doctrine: " The doctrine of man's creatureliness is another point in the doctrine of man where nonbeing has a dialectical character. Being created out of nothing means having to return to nothing. The stigma of having originated out of nothing is impressed on every creature. . . .Being, limited by nonbeing, is finitude. Nonbeing ap- pears as the ' not yet ' of being and as the ' no more ' of being . . everything which participates in the power of being is mixed' with nonbeing. It is being in process of coming from aild going toward nonbeing. It is finite " (ST, pp. 188-189). Nonbeing, as we just found, appears at times as the " not-yet " of being. Ontologists can therefore hardly neglect the question of man's relation to " not-yet-being " and Tillich promptly addresses himself to this problem. Cash-value: Human beings frequently fail to have attributes which they may or will possess at a later time-for example, babies sometimes don't have hair, but later on their heads are covered with hair; a person may at one time know only his native language, but several years later he may have mastered other languages as well, etc., etc. Ontological doctrine: " Being and not-yet-being are 'mixed' in him (man), as they are in everything finite " (ST, p. 236). 5. Being, Nonbeing and " Some Logicians " Tillich is much irked by " some logicians " who " deny that nonbeing has conceptual character and try to remove it from the philosophical scene except in the form of negative judgments " (GB, p. 34). As against the logicians, Tillich insists on " the mystery of non-being " and he recommends that the " fasci- nating " and " exasperating " question, " What kind of being</page><page sequence="19">210 P. EDWARDSS: must we attribute to non-being ? " should be taken seriously. His answer to the logicians is worth reproducing in full: There are two possible ways of trying to avoid the question of nonbeing, the one logical. . .. One can assert that nonbeing is a negative judgement devoid of ontological significance. To this we must reply that every logical structure which is more than merely a play with possible relations is rooted in an onto- logical structure. The very fact of logical denial presupposes a type of being which can transcend the immediate given situation by means of expectations which may be disappointed. An anticipated event does not occur. This means that the judge- ment concerning the situation has been mistaken, the necessary conditions for the ocurrence of the expected event have been non-existent. Thus disappointed, expectation creates the dis- tinction between being and nonbeing. But how is such an ex- pectation possible in the first place ? What is the structure of this being which is able to transcend the given situation and to fall into error ? The answer is that man, who is this being, must be separated from his being in a way which enables him to look at it as something strange and questionable. And such a separation is actual because man participates not only in being but also in nonbeing. Therefore, the very structure which makes negative judgements possible proves the ontological character of nonbeing. Unless man participates in non-being, no negative judgements are possible. The mystery of non- being cannot be solved by transforming it into a type of logical judgement " (ST, p. 187). Elsewhere, if I understand him correctly, Tillich repeatedly quotes, as support of his view concerning the reality of nonbeing, the existence of such " negativities " as " the transitoriness of everything created and the power of the 'demonic' in the human soul and history " (CB, pp. 33-34). I am certain that Tillich would also endorse Heidegger's appeal to such a " nega- tive " phenomena as loathing, refusal, mercilessness, and renun- ciation 1 and William Barrett's discussion of the effects of blind- ness 2 as evidence for the same position. There are so many confusions here that it is difficult to know where to begin. Probably the most serious defect of Tillich's discussion is his failure to be clear about the real point at issue between himself and the " logicians' ". By the " logicians " Tillich presumably means philosophers like Russell, Carnap and Ayer 3 who deny that such words as " nothing " and "nobody" IExistence and Being, p. 373. 2 Irrational Man, pp. 256-257. 3 Russell discusses the subject of negation in " The Philosophy of Logical Atomism ", which is reprinted in Logic and Knowledge, in An</page><page sequence="20">PROFESSOR TILLICI S CONFUSIONS 211 and " not " are names or descriptions. Although they deny this, there are two other things which the " logicians " do not deny. Firstly, they do not deny the existence of the various phenomena to which Tillich refers as " negativities ". They do not deny that human beings quite often behave destructively, that they feel disgust, hatred, or what have you. Nor do they deny that human beings sometimes become blind or crippled in various ways and that the loss of eyes, limbs, or other parts of their bodies produces vast amounts of grief. Not only do the logi- cians not deny any of these phenomena, but it is difficult to see how anybody could believe or argue that such denials are logically implied by the view that " nothing " is not a name or a descrip- tion. Yet, unless such denials are implied by this view, refer- ences to phenomena like hatred or blindness are completely beside the point. The logicians, furthermore, do not deny that " not " and "nothing " are words in the " object-language" and that sen- tences in which they occur are frequently just as " descriptive of reality " as affirmative sentences. I do not know of any " logi- cian " who has ever denied, for example, that the sentence "there is no butter in the refrigerator " is as descriptive of the world as the sentence " there is butter in the refrigerator " or that the sentence " I know nothing about Chinese grammar " is just as descriptive as the sentence " I know a good deal about German grammar ". It is again not easy to see how it could be argued that such denials are logically implied in the view that " nothing " is not a description. I for one also see nothing objectionable in saying that while sentences like " there is butter in the refrigerator " refer to " positive " Enquiry into Meaning and Truth and in Human Knowledge-Its Scope and Limits; Carnap in " The Elimination of Metaphysics through Logical Analysis of Language ", which is reprinted in Ayer's Logical Positivism; Ayer discusses the subject in " Jean-Paul Sartre ", Horizon, 1945, in " Some Aspects of Existentialism," Rationalist Annual, 1948 and in " Negation ", reprinted in his Philosophical Essays. It is perhaps worth adding that the " logicians " are divided among themselves on the question of whether, in Russell's words, " there are facts which can only be asserted in sentences containing the word 'not ' ". William Barrett, who is the most lucid of the existentialist defenders of Nothingness, seems to think that their case would be helped if it could be shown, to use Russell's words once more, that " the world cannot be completely described without the employment of logical words like 'not ' ". This, however, is a confusiorn. From the admission that " not " or " nothing " are indispensable it in no way follows that these words are names or descriptions since it is anything but obvious that only na.mes and descriptions are indispensable.</page><page sequence="21">212 P. EDWARDS: facts, sentences like "there is no butter in the refrigera- tor " refer to " negative " facts, that the former sentence refers to the presence, while the latter refers to the absence of butter in the refrigerator. Whatever misgivings I have about this way of talking concern the use of " fact " and not the use of " positive " and " negative " as qualifying adjectives.' Once the ground is cleared in this way and no appeal is made to such totally irrelevant matters as the existence of hatred and blindness or to the fact that " not " and " nothing " occur in descriptive sentences it is easily seen that the " logicians " are right and that Tillich and other believers in nothingness are wrong. It becomes plain that Tillich and his fellow-existentialists are wrong, not necessarily in believing in some mysterious realm or mode of being which they call " nonbeing " or "nothingness ", but in holding that, if there is such a realm, it is named by the word " nothing ", as that word is normally used. They are wrong, further, in believing that the existence of such " logical struc- tures " as negative judgements implies any transcendent onto- logical truths. I need not waste much time over showing that words like " nobody " or " nothing " are not names or descrip- tions. If somebody asks me, " Who is outside ? " and I say " Bomba is outside" and on a second occasion I answer " Mrs. Bomba is outside ", "Bomba " and " Mrs. Bomba " function as names they refer to unmysterious human beings. If on a third occasion I answer " Nobody is outside ", the word " no- body " is not the name of a mysterious shadowy human being. It functions as a sign of denial. To say that nobody is outside is to say that it is false to maintain that anybody is outside. Similarly, if I say that Germany is separated from Russia by Poland or that New Jersey and New York are separated by the Hudson River, " Poland " and " the Hudson River " are names of certain things or areas. But to say about two objects or areas, the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn, for example, that they are separated by nothing, is to say, in Ayer's words, " that they are not separated; and that is all that it amounts to ".2 One is not asserting here that the two areas are separated by a mysterious area which is named by the word " nothing ". " Nothing ", like " nobody ", functions as a sign of denial and not as a name-either of something familiar or of somethingmyster- ious in a realm to which only specially gifted persons have access. 1 For an innocuous use of " unreality " similar to my use of " negative facts ", see R. L. Cartwright, " Negative Existentials ", Journal of Philosophy, 1960. 2 " Jean-Paul Sartre ", op. cit. p. 18.</page><page sequence="22">PROFESSOR TILLICH S CONFUSIONS 213 It is perhaps worth adding that the dispute is not, as Tillich suggests, between himself and existentialists on one side and " some logicians " on the other. It is between the former group and practically the whole of mankind. Ordinary people do not believe that " nothing" is a name. I do not suppose that ordinary people hold any explicit view on this subject, but any occasion on which the existentialist theory is presented to them, they regard it as a joke. They simply do not believe that anybody seriously advocates such a position. This surely is the only possible interpretation of the mirth provoked by such exchanges as those between the Messenger and the King in Alice Through the Looking Glass. "Who did you pass on the road?" the King went on, holding out his hand to the Messenger for some more hay. i "Nobody," said the Messenger. " Quite right," said the King: this young lady saw him too. So of course Nobody walks slower than you." " I do my best," said the Messenger in a sullen tone. "I'm suie nobody walks much faster than I do." " He can't do that," said the King, " or else he'd have been here first." I have often wondered why existential ontologists pay so little attention to caves, hollow tubes and holes in general. These are clear instances of nonbeing which should silence any sceptic. In certain tablecloths, for example, it is the number and the position of the holes which determines the excellence of the tablecloths. This surely shows that holes are real negativities. I was pleased to come across a discussion of this subject in an essay entitled " On the Social Psychology of Holes" by the unjustly forgotten German writer, Kurt Tucholsky. "When a hole is filled ", Tucholsky asks, " where does it go ? . . . If an object occupies a place, this place cannot also be occupied by another object but what about holes ? If there is a hole in a given place can that place be occupied by other holes as well? And why aren't there halves of holes?" In short: what kind of being must we attribute to holes ? I hope that Tillich or some other existentialist will before long address himself to this question. To my knowledge the only people who have believed that "nothing " is a name are certain metaphysicians (including, it is true, some of the most famous like Hegel) and some beginning students of philosophy who in their first gropings tend to assume that all words are names.</page><page sequence="23">214 P. EDWARDS: PROF. TILLICH'S CONFUSIONS Tillich is right in regarding disappointed expectations and the erroneous beliefs connected with them, as one of the motives for the introduction of various negative terms. He is wrong, inci- dentally, if he thinks that it is only the motive-such phenomena as disagreement, refusal to give information, ignorance, rejection, in a sense in which this is not simply disagreement, have also made it necessary to employ these expressions. His statement that "every logical structure is rooted in an ontological struc- ture" is true in the case of negation if it means no more than, firstly, that negative terms would not have been introduced into our various languages if it were not for disappointed expec- tations, disagreement, ignorance and other phenomena of the kind just mentioned and, secondly, that they frequently occur in sentences which are descriptive of reality. His statement is not true if it means that the word " nothing " names a special reality which needs existentialists or some rival group of onto- logists for its exploration. Tillich's error becomes very evident when we reflect that words like " or " and " and " also have "existential roots". We would not have introduced them if we never hesitated, if our knowledge in a given field were always complete, if we never felt the need to enumerate our possessions, etc. Again, there is no doubt that sentences containing " or " and " and " are frequently descriptive of reality. Yet not even Tillich has had the heart to add and-being or or-being to his ontological inventory. New York University</page></plain_text>
