Rather, there is a set of characteristics, some of which will ap pear in any given work. For example, A-Life artworks might have behaviors, while other artworks do not; they are not static but dynamic and may evolve over time in relation to their en vironments; or they might incorporate both natural and arti ficial elements, calling into question the boundary between the living and the nonliving. These are A-Life research con cepts that, through A-Life art, find their way into people's imag inations in a way that they otherwise could not and in a form that allows them to be directly experienced and readily un derstood. A-Life art is a synthesis of different cultural inputs: the technological buzz of the moment, ideas from research that are sometimes highly specialized, and whatever artistic strategies must be called upon to mold these diverse forces into an artifact that has both aesthetic power and social rele vance. While labs are not a part of most people's everyday lives, many of the applications that arise from them and that are used in industry are. Technologies developed in relation to A Life, artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics research [1] have become familiar to people in daily life through forms of en tertainment. Examples are the virtual pet phenomenon (Tam agotchi; Dogz, Catz and other Petz; Seaman; Furby; AIBO), virtual characters that "learn" through AI in video games, or functional electronic interfaces such as bank machines and smart user interfaces for mobile communications technology. People bring such encounters from their everyday worlds into the gallery and into their experience of A-Life artworks. Everyday Technologies Art embodies A-Life research in a way that connects it to every day lived experience. Marcel Duchamp's revolutionary con cept of the Readymade particularly lends itself to creative A-Life practices [2]. When he declared the famous urinal and bottle rack to be artworks, Duchamp was asserting that the industrial connotations and everyday use value of such ob jects determined their artistic life as Readymades.

After Duchamp and the ensuing dadaist phenome non turned the Readymade into common artistic currency, gallery goers could immediately grasp the need to connect art to the social conditions of living. Several VIDA prize-winning works discussed here operate as Ready mades, alerting us to the nature and impact of the industrial objects that now permeate our lives: electronically driven gadg ets that tend to take over rather than just extend our capabil ities. They are substitutes for life processes, not just add-ons, which is why we have started to think of them as having some kind of life of their own. They present a challenge to our pre existing notions of what is "human," "natural" and "alive." Tickle (1997, VIDA 2.0, see Gallery) by Netherlands artists Erwin Driessens and Maria Verstappen, is a small autonomous robot that walks on the human body to generate a pleasing tickling sensation. When it encounters a slope that is too steep, it will steer in another direction until a safely level surface is found and then continue on its way. This behavior is imple mented using a hardware-instantiated finite state machine. Tickle has qualities of the Readymade in its bridging to the commodity fetishism that surrounds us. It reminds us that we fervently desire the gadgets that might bring us pleasure, es pecially if they are smart in their form of delivery. The same artists made an installation called Tickle Salon (2002, 5.0) which consists of a robot attached to the ceiling and a bed below it on the floor. The interactant lies down on the bed. In between the bed and the ceiling is a suspended feeler made of silky thread and a metal ball, whose movement is determined by sensor feedback from its collisions with the skin surface. As the robot explores, it gently strokes the sur face of the body while at the same time creating and updating the shape of that body in its virtual imagination. The two Tickle works suggest various kinds of everyday con sumer items that could potentially be programmed for sen sitivity to our needs, to ease our lives, entertain us, connect us socially, etc. In contrast, France Cadet's installation Dog ABSTRACT Artificial Life artworks hold a unique place in the art world, one that has been largely mapped by the VIDA interna tional competition through its annual recognition of outstand ing works based on A-Life. Works that have received awards since the VIDA competi tion began in 1999 (25 prize winning artworks and 56 honorary mentions) have gained viewer appreciation and popular ity at the same level as any other kind of art. Yet these works define a territory of their own, delineated here through characteristics of A-Life art that arise from both the artist's studio and the research lab and that mark the 25 awarded artworks. Following this article, the Leonardo VIDA Gallery presents a selection of eight prize-winning works that show the breadth of the competition to date; each is discussed here. ?2008 ISAST LEONARDO, Vol. 41, No. 1, pp. 6-15, 2008 7</page><page sequence="3">3 Fig. 1.

Artist's web page: &lt;www.messymix.com/&gt;. [LABJOl (France, 2003, 6.0, see Gallery) is an overt retooling of a commercial product, a classic Readymade for our time, in which Duchamp's gesture that the art world rebuffed in 1917?signing the urinal with the pseudonym R. Mutt to make the artwork Fountain?is now translated into the hacker strategy of re programming a consumer product. Com posing the installation are Copycat, Dolly, GFP Puppy, Xenodog and felly doggy, five transgenic and chimerical animals that have been transformed from robot dogs; all are based on real cloning experi ments. They retain the robot's basic morphology, but are augmented with at tributes such as a bovine color and horns, skin made of a jelly-like material or other alien substances, or bleating or meowing, all to express mixtures of various "ge netic" information, including that of dogs, cats, ewes, cows, sheep, pigs and jel lyfish. The artist's technical method is to install a customized chip and flash mem ory card into each robot so as to program the robot's 16-motor drive for altered movement, sounds, lighting of the eyes and reading of the various sensors. A work with more literal Readymade qualities in its adaptation of ordinary kitchen equipment is LiveForm: Teleki netics, or LF:TK (2004, VIDA 8.0, see Gallery). This work usurps both the use value and the brand value of commodi ties to generate pockets of collective, lo cal and rather chaotic creation. Artists Jeff Mann and Michelle Teran, Canadian artists living in Germany, build sensors and motors into cutlery, plates, bowls, scissors, corkscrews, etc., to endow them with highly animated expressiveness. These retrofitted items are used for mul tiple physically separated dinner parties that are networked together, preferably through the free Wi-Fi hotspots that now dot many cities: Picnickers in one spot run custom software that collects sen sor data from the gestures of eating and sends it live to identical objects in another location that could be on the other side of the world. In his EX-DD-06 (2006, VIDA 9.0) (Fig. 1), Shih Chieh Huang (Taiwan/U.S.A.) uses very sim ple electronics, such as light bulbs and TVs, combined with gaudy inflatable plas tic tentacles and many hanging wires to make a quasi-biological world that is both alien and quotidian. Other Embodiments An A-Life artwork has by definition an embodiment, a materialization that a viewer can perceive and respond to. VIDA has been open to many different kinds of embodiments, including forms that have often diverged quite radically from those found in the A-Life research world. There, artificial entities with ani mal-like or human-like qualities are sim ulated in the form of pixel clusters on a screen, animated characters or robots? or hybrids of these embodiments. VIDA has recognized many works that address A-Life research not through its repre sentational methods but through the broader cultural issues that it raises. Sev eral VIDA works probe the intersections of biology and artificiality to reveal hid den suppositions about the technolo gization of life processes.

From Spain, Novus Ex tinctus (2001, VIDA 4.0) by Transnational Temps (Andy Deck, Fred Adam and Ver?nica Perales), is an Internet artwork whose central message is that the expan sion of human presence on the World Wide Web, measured via the number of domain names registered daily, climbs in a deadly parallel with the number of species that go extinct. The site has a strong element of marketing spoof as well, linking Latin species names to com mercial sites such as TigerDirect that use the names of exotic animals. Death and the human desire for im mortality are looked at in two very dif ferent ways in Lev?ntate (2002, VIDA 5.0) by Spain's Mariela C?diz (with the collaboration of Kent Clelland) and in Concrete Music (2003, VIDA 6.0) (Fig. 3) by Ethan Bordeaux, Ben Recht, Noah Vawter and Brian Whitman (U.S.A.). Lev ?ntate confronts the viewer with the im age of a female body in a perpetual state of "digital decomposition," as a result of image processing, and projected onto a sarcophagus. Viewers tend to cluster around this sculptural element as for a funerary ritual. Simultaneously, a sound track of digitally decomposed voices plays in the space and is continuously re recorded and mixed with the voices of the audience, to haunting effect. In Con crete Music, immortality is both encapsu lated and epitomized. Inside a concrete slab, the artists have embedded hardware that supports a 30-year song program. On startup, the system loads the program and executes it. From preset parameters, the song composes itself as it slowly drifts away from its base state by means of re cursive remixing of its own flow. With each boot of the system, the song starts over at zero. For a user to hear it all, the piece has to be powered up for the full 30 years, after which time the song will end. Agency: Artificial but Actual The longevity of Concrete Music aside, the rapid rate of obsolescence of electroni cally run gizmos and their ubiquity in the world mean that, in one way or another, many people are in constant negotiation with them. The sense, then, that these things have a kind of agency is now intu ited on a broad scale. As far back as the early 1980s, actor-network theory (ANT) theorized that non-living but dynamic ob jects have the status of "actants." ANT has spread throughout the academic world since its emergence from the discipline of science studies, so that the attribution of agency to non-living things is still much discussed in fields from informa tion systems research to political science. In essence, ANT says that existence is about action rather than the intrinsic nature of a phenomenon or entity: All actants have a history, and it is only through their action in the world that they have an identity. Moreover, non living actants convey the actions of the living: "I live in the midst of technical del egates; I am folded into nonhumans" [3]. The attribution of agency to technical delegates is, in the contemporary world, both pervasive and preconscious, that is, it happens for most people sponta neously without thinking about it ra tionally. A-Life artworks take up this complicated loop when the intentions and thought process of an artist are trans Tenhaaf, Art Embodies A-Life: The VIDA Competition 9</page><page sequence="5">3 Fig. 3.

The dynamic that the work presents to the viewer is the prompt, or cue, by means of which agency is at tributed by the viewer to the nonhuman and nonliving artwork. A-Life art is intensively engaged with this concept of artificial agency?how to elicit it for the viewer and how to estab lish imaginative and meaningful rela tionships with it. Classic artificial agents in the art do main involve those created by U.K. art ists Jane Prophet and Gordon Selley in TechnoSphere, a real-time 3D simulation of an environment populated by virtual creatures launched in 1995. VIDA 2.0 awarded this project an honorary men tion as a pioneering work [4]. The crea tures were created by on-line users from a menu of body parts; they could eat, grow, compete, mate, produce offspring and of course die, all under the watch of their creator. TechnoSphere was on-line until 2002, by which time over a mil lion creatures had been generated by users. In Japanese artist Haruki Nishi jima's Remain in Light (1999, VIDA 4.0, see Gallery), artificial creatures are made by capturing sounds from the electro magnetic spectrum in the atmosphere (made by radios, cell phones, etc.) using an "insect net," which is really an an tenna. The recorded sounds are entered into a computer and their frequencies correlated with a color scheme to gen erate projected globes of light. These "electronic insects" then float around the screen; when they hit its edge, where they tend to cluster when someone comes into the space, they emit their respec tive sounds. Bits of sound data that float imperceptibly in urban space are given visible and audible insect-like behavior, suggesting that they have swarm behav ior that we merely cannot detect. Robots tend to foreground autono mous behaviors such as mobility and sen sitivity to their environment and to mimic the sensory responses of humans or animals. However, A-Life robotic art works are invariably different from robots found in research, even if they investi gate many of the same questions about agency and artificial embodiment. Un like research robots that are studied to gain quantifiable data, robotic artworks call attention to relationships between robots and humans, whether those hu mans are the creators of a work or mem bers of the public. It is not simply a question of objective or subjective points of view; it is a question of the robotic artist wanting to elicit narrative elements and affective responses that complicate a viewer's response to the work. In the lab, those narratives may be present but are set aside. For example, Bill Vorn and Louis-Phillipe Demers's La Cour des Mir acles (Canada, 1997, VIDA 2.0) (Fig. 4) presents 30 robotic entities that each demonstrate a dysfunction, in a combi nation of physical and mental suffering, much like the cripples, beggars and criminals of the medieval "court of mira cles." The robots show an unquestionable power in their abrasive clamor for at tention, even with their very limited repertoire of movements and behaviors. Because of their visual and behavioral ref erences to hybrid species, France Cadet's retooled robots in Dog [LABJ01 are re plete with topical news stories and evoke the wariness associated with potentially unregulated genetic engineering. In the case of Carlos Corpa and Ana Mar?a Garcia Serrano's PaCo?Poeta Au tom?tico Callejero Online (Spain, 2004, VIDA 7.0) (Article Frontispiece), the artists' concept is to explore the replace ment of humans with machines. Here, however, the machine is not designed as an improvement on human capacities, but is a wheelchair-bound robot that re cites and prints out computer-generated poems. The robot holds out a "hand" Fig. 4. Bill Vorn and Louis-Philippe Deniers, La Cour des Miracles, interactive robotic installation, 1997. (? Bill Vorn) Shared first prize, VIDA 2.0.

Ken Feingold's Head (U.S.A., 1999, VIDA 3.0) (Fig. 5), although not a robot but a realistic animatronic sculp ture, considers the quest of AI to replicate human cognitive functions in artificial media, functions that are exemplified by listening and responding. Head does poorly at those activities, letting us know in its own circuitous way that cognition is embodied knowledge that does not work well when even partially disembodied. Artificial agency holds another kind of fascination when it parallels investiga tions in biochemistry, where the line be tween natural and artificial methods of research is a thin one. An "autonomous agent," in the biochemical sense, means the smallest organic unit that is self-sus taining and self-replicating?like a cell. However, life at the cellular level is largely revealed in the modeling of its dynamics using computing and digital imaging, be cause those dynamics are impossible to piece back together from information gleaned from isolated entities observed in a lab [5]. Several works recognized by VIDA fo cus on agency as a function of systems that, like living cells, are always in pro cess. Even if the mechanics, the physics or the algorithms that generate the visi ble processes in these artworks are not readily understood, viewers are invited to experience them as metaphorically alive. From the U.S.A., Scott Draves's Bomb (1994, VIDA 2.0) suggests a biochemi cal/biophysical definition of agency in its patterns of flow and connectivity. Bomb is an "eye candy" program of imagery gen erated through non-linear iterated sys tems, such as video feedback. Dripping Sounds (2002, VIDA 7.0, see Gallery) by Federico Muelas of Spain is an image and sound-generating apparatus that is always in flux, never repeating its sequences. It has a Dripping Machine, through which ink is dripped into water, disperses and is then optically projected, and a Sound Screen, where the moving image projected on its surface is trans lated into sounds of varying pitch and fre quency. Daniel Palacios Jimenez's Waves (Spain, 2006, VIDA 9.0) (Fig. 6) is based 3 Fig. 6. Daniel Palacios, Waves, two motors in steel cylinders, elastic rope, pedestals, sensors, electronics, 2006. (?

Bridging Worlds Research into artificial agency has many different facets, from data-mining agents to affective robots that can act on their emotions. A-Life artworks, whether in a gallery setting or not, allow artificial agents to be instantiated and tested out side the lab. Even in research, the con cept of anthropomorphism has often been invoked to account for how agency is attributed. A-Life art shows that, al though anthropomorphism has com monsense appeal, it is much over-used and really does not explain very much. In particular, it assumes that attributing agency to something nonliving is always the same kind of process and happens in the same way for everybody. Anthropo morphism is useful if the uniqueness of each person's experience is also recog nized. To accomplish the attribution of artificial agency, A-Life artworks have to play with the viewer's state of mind and engage her or his cognitive capacity to hold two simultaneous but contradic tory ideas: the rational knowledge that one is anthropomorphizing the artwork and the willingness to be completely over powered by the sense of the piece as hav ing its own autonomous behaviors and possibly even intentions. A-Life artworks that are interactive present a special case in how agency and autonomy are attributed, because the viewer (here, more accurately described as the interactant) is caught up in a di rect experience of the work's dynamics, often involving an "entrainment" phase in which the interactant learns effective responses to the work's behaviors. In terpretation at a semiotic or concep tual level is not necessary. When an artist conceives of an interactive work, modes of contact between its programmed be haviors and the physical presence of the interactant are given great attention, because bridging the gap between the affective context of the interactant and the agent(s) in the work, as well as the overall environment, is a primary con cern. For example, in each of the two Tickle works by Driessens and Verstappen, a strong sensory connection between the person and the machine is an under standing shared by all interactants, even if the experience itself is unique to a par ticular person. The sense of connection is extended even to observers who are watching the interaction. Paula Gaetano is a young Argentinian artist who explores the concepts of em bodiment and autonomy, which are key to robot building, by reducing their overt features to bare essentials. Her robot is called Alexitimia (2006, VIDA 9.0, see Gallery), after a term that means the in capacity to verbalize emotions. The robot is perversely minimal (a soft rubbery blob mounted on a low pedestal) and has no mobility or apparent articulators such as limb-like parts, sounds or lights that in dicate responsiveness to its environment. Interactants have no explicit information about how to interact with the object, but when they touch it out of curiosity, Alex itimia "sweats": there are touch sensors embedded in its surface, which cause wa ter in a tank hidden in the base of the work to run out through small punctures in the latex skin. The minimalism of this work permits the interactant to recognize the instant that the sculpture responds, which is the instant of attribution of agency to it, and also allows each inter actant to realize that her/his perform ance with the work is a unique one. The Universal Whistling Machine (Canada/U.S.A., 2004, VIDA 7.0, see Gallery) is a wall-mounted interface that consists of a speaker, camera and micro phone embedded in a neutral white sur face. The U. W.M. senses the presence of living creatures in its vicinity and attracts them with a signature whistle. Given a re sponsive whistle, U. W.M. counters with a composition based on a time-frequency analysis of the response. The artists, Marc Bohlen and J.T. Rinker, prefer to install their machines in quiet, low-traffic spaces of exchange and transition such as rest rooms, corridors and elevator lobbies, so that they catch people by surprise. The U. W.M. shows how the transcultural and transtemporal character of whistling extends quite naturally to the machine world. The agency of the machine and its initiatory role in eliciting the satisfaction of the whistle exchange are immediately understood [6]. In U.S. artist Ken Rinaldo's Autopoiesis (2000, VIDA 3.0) (Fig. 7), interactants walk among a group of 15 robotic sound sculptures whose collective behavior changes over time. Each arm-like sculp ture, suspended from the ceiling, can Fig. 7. Ken Rinaldo, Autopoiesis, Cabernet Sauvignon grapevines, urethane plastic, sensors, motors, cameras, custom electronics, 2000-2005.

At the same time, the entire group sends its data to a central state controller for coordi nation of group behavior. The interac tant intuitively grasps that the behavior of the sculptures is more agitated, com plex and probing when a person is pres ent, while it is more serene and in a state of "waiting" when being observed from the outside. At the tip of two of the arms, lipstick cameras project what they see onto the walls of the space, giving the in teractant a sense of being observed as much as of observing. In A-Life artworks, the artistry of ma terials, aesthetics and concepts is em ployed to induce participants into relationships with experimental systems and apparatuses. The human must es tablish a relationship with a technologi cal system rather than simply controlling it, and the system itself can suggest in terpretations of what it is doing and how it is running. If there is any single goal for these strategies, it is awareness of the elicited relationships as social exchanges, with an increased consciousness of one's biases and experience (from novice to ex pert) upon entering and leaving the ex change. This builds a compelling case for the idea of the co-evolution of humans and our technologies: Both the humans and the machines become actants who have agency and inform each other, re sulting in composite societies of agents that include both natural and artificial members. Even if A-Life artists do not explicitly engage the research areas in AI and A Life that investigate social intelligence in mixed populations of human and artifi cial agents, one phenomenon that has emerged in the VIDA artworks is the cre ation of social worlds in which the process of networked computation itself has its own kind of agency. Electric Sheep (U.S.A., 1999, VIDA 4.0, see Gallery), also by Scott Draves, generates a network of contribu tor clients who together build MPEGs in the form of "animated fractal flames." These can be subsequently downloaded and viewed as continuously changing ab stract image sequences. Electric Sheep al lows us to think about how a creative so cial grouping in the digital commons can make a shared visual space for a collec tive virtual life-form. Stanza's The Central City (U.K., 1997-2003, VIDA 6.0) (Fig. 8) gives us an interactive representation of such networks as they might be im planted in urban locales, where they would grow organically and bleed into the city. Using generative processes, this work visually and sonically interconnects information networks (including sur veillance systems) with urban networks (blocks of streets, grids of services, etc.) to make a constantly transmuted envi ronment. LF.TKs networked dinner par ties also intervene as actants by calling for new social protocols for participants to explore. In the development and study of arti ficial social intelligence, empathy is a key concept, because it links emotion and cognition together in a way that involves making a mental model of someone else's state of mind. It is an instance of em bodied cognition. Our ability to attribute empathy to an A-Life agent as a function of its design generates a positive feedback 3 Fig. 8.

Artists' web page: &lt;www.w?e.net/&gt;. loop because it elicits a corresponding state in the person interacting with that agent and thereby calls upon empathy as a framework for interpreting the whole exchange that takes place. This is an ex ample of social learning and it occurs in several of the VIDA works. For instance, we could say that the robot arm hold ing the lit candle in Netherlands artist Erik Olofsen's Divine Methods/Hidden Mo tives (2005, VIDA 8.0) exhibits empathy for the believer who is determined to hold onto her/his belief. Or the empa thy could be read as directed toward the skeptic who sees the contortions that believing requires. Either way, the work draws out empathy from a viewer toward itself and builds a powerful empathetic exchange that synthesizes knowing and feeling. Head and La Cour des Miracles are other works that elicit empathy and flesh out a communicative exchange that is not controlled by either humans or artificial entities but lies in a space between the beings involved. Ethos/Response Because of the lifelike qualities of em bodiment and behavior that A-Life re searchers pursue as a guiding principle, artifacts from A-Life research as well as A-Life artworks can be said to embody technology itself?at least in psychiatrist and cultural theorist Jeanne Randolph's definition of technology as a repository of our preconscious desires and fears. Her technological ethos is sited "in our pre conscious, making its judgments about what we will value, what we will not value, what we think we are seeing, what we feel we are seeing" [7]. Those embedded val ues, including quantification, efficiency and economy of means, tend to be highly instrumental. Such deep-seated attitudes about technology are invoked when A Life artworks are deployed or enacted by their audience. This accounts for why in efficient, dysfunctional forms of tech nology have held so much appeal for artists. Because works that are autonomous artificial agents become metonyms for technology itself (the part stands for the whole), their dysfunctionality or defiance of instrumental purpose truly stands in protest against the instrumental values we have realized in technology. The Ap pearance Machine (1997, VIDA 3.0) (Fig. 9), by Willy LeMaitre and Eric Rosen zveig, Canadian artists living in the U.S.A., is an accident-generating machine fed by detritus from the streets of New York City, where it is physically located. The ma chine's perpetual and solitary activity is to spin bits of garbage on its turntable for image capture as well as image analysis that generates sounds, outputting a live video/audio stream that is networked to a remote site. The resulting display is a highly tongue-in-cheek subversion of the industrial entertainment complex. In contrast, AP0201 (2004, VIDA 8.0) by Martin Howse and Jonathan Kemp of the U.K., is meant to be installed in harsh, preferably remote conditions, where its key relationship is to be with the envi ronment. Three constructions of small solar panels mounted on upright metal studs, three small LCD screens and elec tronics for wireless communication con stitute the parts of AP0201. There is no useful data that an observer can glean from these "self-display devices," which look as if they should be doing important work, whether meteorological or military. They simply show the code that they are processing as they pick up data from their surroundings, code that is then modified and shared among them. Spore 1.1 (2004, VIDA 7.0), by S.W.A.M.P. (Dou glas Easterly/Matt Kenyon) of the U.S.A., uses a rubber tree purchased from Home Depot tended by a computer connected to the Internet via a wireless connec tion and programmed with open source 14 Tenhaaf, Art Embodies A-Life: The VIDA Competition</page><page sequence="10">software to check weekly the value of Home Depot's stock on Yahoo. Through a mechanized watering system, the plant gets watered if share values are up and suffers drought if the stock goes down. If the plant dies, it goes back to the store under its one-year guarantee and is re placed by a new one?consumer protec tion at its ironic best. This is not to say that the opposite holds true, that "functional" A-Life art works (or A-Life research artifacts for that matter) uphold our preconscious, irra tionally idealized expectations of tech nology. Artists who study, collaborate with or otherwise derive their ideas from research are working more in parallel with technological developments, but usually ironically and in the DIYmode of art practice that gives ordinary people en try points to the technology. These are all areas in which we can readily see the richness in the territory of A-Life art. This is not just a one-way street, however: The A-Life research com munity has become interested in A-Life artists over the past few decades precisely because of their deployment of research concepts in public space. Their artworks call attention to the role of the "partic ipant subject" and invite the recogni tion that one of those subjects is the researcher her- or himself?albeit an expert one rather than a novice. A-Life artworks can explicitly explore the bound ary between the researcher and the sub jects of the experiment: "This researcher will have to allow for?perhaps even ex plore?other emotions than those of the ideal distanced witness" [8]. This kind of shift in thinking, and the exchange of in terests and working methods in general, continues to be one of the most fruitful areas of art and science crossover. In its 10th year of life, the VIDA competition continues to define the characteristics that make A-Life art distinct and inter esting to a new generation of both artists and gallery-goers.

A-Life can be said to embody AI, with robotics be ing a particular hardware form of embodiment. This thinking follows from Rodney Brooks's embodied AI, based on principles of subsumption architecture for robotics (layers of simple behaviors that lead to com plex behavior). Specific concepts of embodiment pervade A-Life and AI: for example, Justine Cassell's Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA), which is a virtual human capable of interacting with humans using both language and nonverbal behavior. 2.1 have previously proposed that biology operates as a Readymade in A-Life research and artworks.

There have been five special prizes given over the years, for pioneering work in A-Life art, innovation in A-Life research, and special mentions by the jury. Note also that 15 incentive awards for new produc tion to artists residing in Iberoam?rica (Spain, Por tugal and Latin America) have been awarded, beginning with VIDA 4.0 in 2001. 5. See Stuart A.
