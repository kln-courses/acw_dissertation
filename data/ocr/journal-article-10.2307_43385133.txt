<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ideology and Violence in Modern Turkish Literature AHMET Ö. EVÎN University of Pennsylvania He spoke , and sorrow came over the Ar gives at his vaunting , and beyond others he stirred the anger in wise Peneleos. He charged Akamas, who would not stand up against the onset of lord Peneleos. He then stabbed with the spear Ilioneus the son of Phorbas the rich in sheepf locks, whom beyond all men of the Trojans Hermes loved , and gave him possessions . Ilioneus was the only child his mother had borne him . This man Peneleos caught underneath the brow , at the bases of the eye , and pushed the eyeball out, and the spear went clean through the eye-socket and tendon of the neck, so that he went down backward, reaching out both hands, but Peneleos drawing his sharp sword hewed at the neck in the middle, and so dashed downward the head, with helm upon it, while still on the point of the big spear the eyeball stuck . He, lifting it high like the head of a poppy, displayed it to the Trojans and spoke vaunting over it: 'Trojans, tell haughty Ilioneus ' beloved father and mother, from me, that they can weep for him in their halls, since neither shall the wife of Promachos, Alegenor's son, take pride of delight in her dear lord's coming, on that day when we sons of the Achaians come home from Troy in our vessels. 9 So he spoke, and the shivers came over the limbs of all of them, and each man looked about him for a way to escape the sheer death.1 Inasmuch as human violence is as old as history, its depiction has recurred in the literary product* of all ages and cultures from the very beginning of oral narrative tradition. The forgoing passage from the Iliad is a vivid account of a battle scene between the Trojans and the Achaians; its power, enhanced typically by the visual imagery of the Homeric epic, serves in turn to heighten the awesomeness of the dreadful event. This is a scene which combines pictorial symbolism with martial detail, and yet it is also one which employs rhetorical devices to advantage in illuminating not only the pathos of the situation, but also the ethos of the protagonists. The passage marks the climax of Book XIV, which portrays a series of combats. At the end of it, the bard of old invokes the muses to help him remember how numerous other men perish on the plains of Troy "once Zeus had driven the terror upon them,"2 and finishes the section with a formidable catalogue. Such graphically rendered circumstances of violence in one of the earliest books of Western civilization seem to us remote and free of any pathological dimension. The Iliad , after all, is an epic poem celebrating an historical event, and the deeds of its protagonists are measured against attributes of heroism. The warriors of the classical epic strove to fulfill the conditions desired of them; they lived their lives in imitation of their anthropomorphic gods and acted in a way compatible to the roles that were thought to be assigned to them by the Olympian deities.3 As they were engaged in combat on the shores of the Aegean, they perceived themselves to be the pawns of the gods and demonstrated a pattern of behavior in keeping with the extreme concept of sportsmanship of the period. No matter how hair-raising the narrative may be, the 6</page><page sequence="2">modem reader's response to the Iliad is not primarily conditioned by his reaction to violence or cruelty. Those are a part of a larger entity, the story itself, which celebrates an historical event in an up-beat fashion, presenting it in terms of heroic feats. The total acceptance by the protagonists, not of fate, but of their assigned roles, conditions our response to the situation depicted in the Iliad. Violence in this epic does not stem from rebellion. Nor is cruelty underscored as a wanton act above and beyond that which society is capable of accepting. As long as cruelty is defined in terms of pathological deviation, it could hardly be said that the Iliad is concerned with the exercise of cruelty although individual acts of violent behavior are depicted. Patho- logical deviation can hardly be ascribed to the warriors in the Illiad , who act out their roles, sanctioned by the society, in a manner expected of men during a specific historical period. Although the nature of violence here is different from other depictions of savage and brutal acts of killing, the very texture of the narrative, the viewpoint held by the narrator, is vastly at odds with modern sensibilities. Violence in literature is not a new development. A glance at Western literary tradition reveals a continuum of violent deeds and misdeeds: those in Greek tragedy stemming from human error and resulting in inescapable punishment; those in other epics of antiquity where the hero's destiny is battling with the obstacles in the course of his voyage; those in Roman tragedy - perhaps the least well remembered owing to the excesses of Seneca's prose and themes; those of the medieval knight, whose fight for the sake of religion, state and society was glorified in the celebrated dictum of the Spanish renaissance, Dios , el rey, y mi dama. From the renaissance onward, with the rise of national literatures, instances of violence multiply so rapidly and the circumstances of violent behavior vary so greatly as to render a brief thematic summary impossible. Nor is it my intention here to present a general catalogue of violence in literature. These preliminary remarks were made to underscore the difference between incidence of violence and examination of violence in the literary text. In narrative literature, the focus on violence as a central theme begins to emerge with the growing interest in the individual. There is indeed a correlation between the rise of the novel and consciousness of human behavior on the individual level. The novel is a result not only of cultural transformation, but also of "a political necessity for individual psychology."4 As Erich Kahler has pointed out, the individual's motivations governing his behavior and relationship to his environment became the primary concern of literature once the belief in the supreme authority of the external world was shaken. When man became responsible for his deeds, the novelist became engaged in presenting, documenting, analyzing and explaining those deeds. Modern literature and its unique institution, The Novel , is thus primarily concerned with man with respect to either his psychology or social relationships. Violence in modern prose narrative, then, appears either as a manifestation of a malady or as a result of social incompatibility. In whichever novel it occurs, it is not incidental to the plot but is a central statement informed by the unique circumstances leading to its eruption. A second aspect of violence in modern literature that ought to be mentioned is that it differs not in degree but in kind from the accepted norms of human intercourse; it represents a deviation from the anticipated normalcy of everyday life, a state of anomie. In socially committed revolutionary literature it may be presented in a positive light; but even in such a context it represents a vital movement; a revolt against the status quo; a process of transformation. In other cases it may simply stem from an individual's frustration with the existing political or ethical order. An encapsulated definition of violence itself is beyond the means of intellectual endeavor: it is an act which one interprets through either its causes or results, and the manner of approach is dictated by the varying methodologies of several disciplines. In attempting to present in a coherent fashion the theme of violence in a national 7</page><page sequence="3">literature and to relate it to the political and social milieu, I shall venture to submit three broad categories of violence. This is obviously a risky proposition, but as Kenneth Clark once said, generalizations "in order not to be boring, must be slightly risky." One is violence as a result of psychological factors. An individual's state of anomie leading to violent conduct does not occupy a place of central concern in modern Turkish literature, for, as we shall shortly see, modern Turkish writers got increasingly involved in social issues and helped build a strong tradition of socially committed literature. This is not to say that the vast problem of alienation which pervades modern European literature from the rise of French naturalism to the current vogue of non-novel novels examining criminal behavior was totally ignored in Turkey. However, due to the traditional nature of greater segments of Turkish society, until recently the alienation syndrome could only be expected to occur in one of the few cosmopolitan, urban-areas. It is difficult to be a "loner" in a communal group where values are shared and privacy is ignored. The prototype of the alienated individual, the village idiot, remained as a part of the local color in fiction dealing with rural Turkey. In the urban sector, alienated individuals were more often associated with the theme of loneliness which resulted in sentimental portraits of characters unable to find or function within a peer group. Furthermore, in the tradition of the French novel, the model on which modern Turkish fiction was initially based, the pathology of violence was first taken up from the viewpoint of Darwinist thought.5 According to this determinist theory, violent behavior or at least the urge to enact violence was a psychological condition, deeply rooted in the evolutionary stages of human life and passed on by heredity. Turkish writers reacted negatively to such a clinical view and considered it debasing and unworthy of literary merit. Scientific explanation unaccompanied by moral indignationin the face of what were considered unnatural acts made the Turkish writers of differing persuasions concur in the condemnation of "filth" in Zola's novels.6 Alienation, in Turkish literature, demanded pity insofar as it did not result in criminal behavior; in this respect the majority of writers took a position so as to reinforce the ethical views generally shared in society. The remaining two types of violence in our scheme of categorization are those that are symptomatic of political or social tensions; and their discussion bears relevance to some of the principal conceťhs of modern Turkish literature. The distinction between political and social, difficult as it is to make, is deliberately put forth here in order to differentiate roughly between the system of institutions governing the state and the system of values governing communities; it will, I hope, become clearer as we go along and help us understand better the varying ideological perspectives informing the Turkish novel. It is appropriate here, therefore, to consider briefly the developemnt of prose fiction in Turkey and its relation to historical circumstances. As was hinted at earlier, the novel arrived in Turkey as an "imported" genre, first through translation of French popular fiction soon after the establishment of privately owned newspapers in 1869. In 1876 what may be called the first Turkish novel was published. This book, called Intibah (Awakening), was modeled after the French romanticist fiction of the time; it gave an account of a tragic affair between a woman of lower social standing and a gentleman who spurned her by favoring another woman who eventually occasioned his desperate end. It is a moral story with a message that wrongdoing does not go unpunished. In its preface, the author reaches a distinction between traditional narrative genres in Turkish literature and the novel, which, he says, is concerned with a true picture of life as opposed to tales and stories that admit of supernatural occurrences. During the next quarter century, the novel in Turkey went through a period of gestation, and its development was in no small measure influenced by the tenets of French realism. That this was so is in no way surprising since one of the chief aims of 8</page><page sequence="4">the writers was to break away from traditional story-telling and establish a genre capable of addressing current social issues. The early Turkish novel, serialized in newspapers and periodicals, found a growing audience and in turn became a convenient vehicle for didacticism. A majority of the writers assumed the role of public teachers and disseminated information as well as their views through the literary medium. One of the chief concerns of the early novel was the growing cleavage between the westernized and traditional sectors of the society. To some, westernization meant radical departure from time-honored values, the negation of one's cultural heritage, and hence it was viewed as being detrimental to the moral order. Yet these very traditionalists were also supporting the idea of adopting from the west material advancements of civilization. To others, who grew up in mansions furnished in Louis XV or empire style, circulating among the cosmopolitan upper classes of Istanbul, westernization was an established way of life, albeit different in quality and conventions from the customs that pertained in the lower middle class neighborhoods. The polemics that arose from these views remained on the intellectual level, as indeed the social cleavages of the period did not provoke physical confrontation. Against this background of debate which had a valuable effect as catalyst, the Turkish novel not only developed in a matter of two decades as a major literary genre, but also became committed to social issues. The Turkish Republic as a nation-state was founded after the demise of the Ottoman Empire and the most important cultural task was to reinforce national identity as the central governing ideology. The transformation from empire to state required a re- ordering of priorities in addition to strengthening the unifying bonds of society. Furthermore, the transition had been accomplished as a result of an immensely difficult and painful salvage operations: a War of Independence fought in the wake of defeat and dismemberment of the Empire in World War I, The War of Independence (1920-22), and the emergence of the nation-state became the chief concern of Turkish literature in the two decades following the proclamation of the Republic (1923). The revolutionary spirit of the period affected the development of Turkish literature in two significant ways: one was the formation of a nationalist ideology which espoused the cause of unity based on common experience and common goal; and the second, a corollary of nationalism, was the broadening of focus to deal with issues relating to Turkish culture and society as a whole. As a result, Turkish fiction began turning away from the educated milieu in which it was born and got increasingly involved with lives of the urban poor and of the Anatolian peasant. Local concerns, individualist approaches and the elitist dictum of "art for art's sake" lost their relevance in the face of national awakening. The hardships of the war years and the privations in the wake of defeat at the end of World War I constituted one major theme in the Turkish fiction of this period. The War of Independence naturally provided the setting for a large number of novels dealing with heroism. But literature soon became informed by the wider social implications of the Turkish transformation, and discovered the enormous distance created over centuries between the urban centers and under- developed rural areas. The cosmopolitan society of Istanbul and Izmir stood in stark contrast to the folkways of Anatolia, neglected and spurned by the high imperial culture for several centuries. Turkishness of the Republic could only be realized through the accommodation of Turkish culture, the folkways, local values of the Anatolian peasantry. The ideological concern of establishing one nation was reflected in literature with the rise of a new type of fiction taking a panoramic view of the country. It was also during this period that Turkish literature took a decisive turn towards social engagement, even at the expense of ignoring the individual. For writers, the vast and unexplored terrain of folk culture, new national identity, the reception of Kemalist reforms, the vast social transformations and dislocations following wars, and the 9</page><page sequence="5">drawing of national boundaries afforded a very rich field to cultivate. The entire national experience would naturally be the foremost theme of fiction. These develop- ments also served the purposes of the Kemalist regime in disseminating a new consciousness of national life. Through the cultural organization of the Republican Party, publication and award programs were instituted to encourage the participation of literature in the nation-building process by reinforcing national and cultural cohesiveness. Prime Minister Ismet Inönti, speaking in 1934 at Ankara University, said: The history of the Turkish revolution is simple, and is based on the laws of nature. Life is something to be admired, protected and lived. No dire situation of human existence would justify a loss of respect for one's own life or the life of others. To hold the value of life in contempt is a syndrome of illness, of deviation. Yet on the other hand, life ought to be sacrificed for the sake of society. In an environment where life cannot be readily sacrificed for the sake of society, man is rendered weak and helpless in the face of nature's abuses.7 The political ideology espoused by the state had the effect of reinforcing the develop- ment of social realism in Turkish literature where individual acts gained significance in proportion to their relevance to wider issues. The social commitment of Turkish literature was thus facilitated and reinforced as a result of the fact that the official ideology espoused by the state coincided with themes that captured the imagination of the writer as well as the reading public. The state was also in a position to take advantage of the immense influence that literature commands in Turkish society. Another factor that ought to be taken into account in connection with the prestige of the literary profession is that most writers in this period were also high government officials or widely respected professionals. The literary, educational and the official elite constituted an extended but single circle and thus felt equally responsible for effecting political as well as cultural cohesion. The role of literature was to be one of social mobilization, not in support of the regime, but in support of a national identity, for the primary task was to disseminate the notion of a secularist, populist state among the traditionalist sector of the society. It is after World War II that the divergence between the official ideology and the Utopian concerns of social realism began to be deeply felt. First, a new generation of writers began to be heard. The foremost among these were younger people from rural backgrounds who had been educated in the village institutes, teacher training schools established as a part of the educational mobilization program of the Republic. Secondly, they were no longer affected by the sense of national accomplishment that the previous generation was inbued with. Thirdly, they saw a different kind of reality prevailing among the poor peasants from what their urban and urbane predecessors saw. They saw discrimination, low pay, abject poverty, the greed of the wealthy landlord, the plight of the share-cropper; they furthermore saw the collusion of local officials with the rich landlords and a conspiracy to perpetuate a feudalist order. The romantic notions of rural Anatolia where the virtuous peasant lives his life unadulterated by the cynicism and moral turpitude of urban ways were shattered by stories of injustice, violence and struggle for survival; they gave way to a stark form of social realism, ruthless in its pursuit of documentation. This type of fiction that aimed at exposing the plight of the have-nots became enormously popular and from the 1950s onward constituted the main stream of Turkish literature. As an indigenous genre, it was dubbed "the village novel," although it also included stories written about the plight of the worker. Orhan Kemal (1814-1972), one of the most prolific short-story writers of his generation, took up the theme of exploitation 10</page><page sequence="6">of the worker. He was not only openly critical of capitalist developments in Turkey, but also examined the impact of industrialization in its early stages on the laborer, whose plight included dislocation from the village to the industrial town where he remained alienated and destitute. There is more pathos than violence in Orhan Kemal's work, which often pictured the dehumanizing effect of poverty upon his protagonists. Fakir Bay kurt (b. 1929), a village techer by training, aimed "to present the situation of the peasants among whom I grew up while taking into consideration the realities of art."8 Baykurt also considered the mission of artistic creation to better the human condition and educate the reader. In other words, through art not only could the public be imbued with new awareness, but also the specific historical circumstance of social development could be mapped. What we have here is a compacted and inelegant rendition of the Marxist-humanist view adumbrated by Georg Lukacs, who saw the development of realism as being fundamentally tied to the rise of bourgeois society, inevitably leading to class conflicts.9 Indeed his prize-winning Yilanlarin öcii (The Revenge of the Snakes, 1959) recounts the mortal struggle between a poor peasant family and the village headman who allows a piece of their property to be appropriated by a rich man. Yet the conflict here takes place in the absence of bourgeois society where the battle lines are drawn between the peasantry at large and the powerful landlords who have influence over local officials. This theme became a prototype for literally hundreds of novels written since the 1950s, while indicting those responsible for it, including the government. However, the most famous contemporary Turkish novelist Yaçar Kemal (b. 1925) employed a sophisticated approach in bringing to light a complex set of historical and cultural effects underlying the conflict between the landlord and sharecropper. In Ince Memed (Memed My Hawk, 1954), his first novel that catapulted him to national and then to international prominence, he depicted the revolt of Memed against the injustice his family suffered from Abdi Aga, the local landlord. Memed escapes from the village, but wherever he goes Abdi Aga's henchmen find him and return him, just like a serf, to his village. At the fend he becomes a bandit in order to seek revenge and disappears during a combat with gendarmes after having killed Abdi Aga. Memed, the latter-day Robin Hood, brought new possibilities to Turkish fiction, including a revolutionary outlook. With him the traditional folk-hero of old Turkish oral narratives was revitalized and rehabilitated and a note of optimism was suggested against the dreadful miseries reflected in much of the village novel. In his subsequent works, notably in The Legend of the Thousand Bulls (1971), Yaçar Kemal examined the historical circumstances leading to the imbalanced distribution of wealth leading to the conflict between the sharecroppers and landlords of the Çukurova region in southern Turkey, and explained in his novels the wide cultural disparity between those who had settled and taken up agriculture in the late nineteenth century, and others who had remained nomadic until it was too late for them to be able to afford purchasing land. Whereas the landed groups had been acculturated with the conserva- tism of small towns, the nomads retained their pride in independence and broadly liberal, heterodox understanding of religion and values. The economic aspect of the conflict between the latter and the former groups was reinforced by cultural diversity: nomads, no longer being able to support themselves in the modernizing world through their traditional means, depended for their livelihood on land owned by a group who felt a deeply-rooted animosity toward their values. Until the publication of The Legend of the Thousand Bulls , the so-called village novel exposed the plight of the sharecropper, the poor peasant or the underprivileged worker chiefly in terms of social injustice, the correction of which would depend on changing the order of things. Among the broad spectrum of writers who belonged to the social- realist school, there were radicals who employed literature as a podium to advocate 11</page><page sequence="7">radical change in Turkey; there were also those who recorded, with guarded optimism, the rising standard of living in rural and industiral communities. But the main stream of Turkish socal realism was concerned with exposing inequality and exploitation, and showing how the existing social order perpetrated these injustices. Yet the existing social order, according to the novelists, was one that was reinforced by the state through the intermediary of its governing institutions. Taken to task was not only the corrupt local official who took advantage of the rich man's bribe, but also the systems of taxation, eduction, welfare and justice which were shown to operate defectively, not providing for the poor and the meek. Memed's killing Abdi Aga or the thousands of instances of beatings, interrogations, kidnappings and rape that occur in these novels are not politically motivated; they are a part of the violent proceedings on which social realism thrives. But implicit in the world of discourse these novels created is the suggestion of an alternative order through which peace and prosperity could be attained. This, of course, has a ring of socialist utopia, which, in fact, is not far off the mark in describing what many of the village novelists would have liked to see. It is not the socialist aspect but the Utopian thought that concerns our discussion: the utopianism of socially-committed writers derives from the fact that they sharpen and intensify the unpleasant aspects of reality with a view to changing that reality. As Karl Mannheim formulated, inasmuch as ideology refers to a state of mind incongrous with reality, but nevertheless provides a legitimizing framework of absolutes for social life, utopia refers to a similar state of mind which attempts to change the social reality from which it originates.10 The political nature of the way in which tensions are depicted in the village novel of the 1950s and 1960s lies precisely in this Utopian aspect: victims are victimized not because of their vulnera- bility as individuals, but because the entire political and economic system condemns them to a state of vulnerability and then allows them to be victimized. In The Legend of the Thousand Bulls , as we have seen, in addition to the socio- economic reasons, the incompatibility of local values was shown to be a factor in the conflict between the nomadic highlanders and the feudal landowners. More recently, Yaçar Kemal has investigated the tensions existing in traditional society. Yilani öldiirseler (Kill the Serpent, 1976) deals with the notorious custom of blood-feud and examines how community pressure may even lead to matricide. The story is narrated through partial use of the stream-of-consciousness technique as the author hears it from the protagonist serving a prison sentence. Hasan's mother was kidnapped and subsequently married to a well-to-do farmer, a man much older than herself. A few years later, when Hasan was a small boy, the man whom his mother had been in love with appears and eventually kills the husband; he is caught and killed as well. The villagers believe that Hasan's father's death has not been properly avenged since they consider his mother responsible for her husband's death and a prostitute at that. The rest of the story conveys the psychological and social pressure put on Hasan to rectify the situation, for they also believe that this type of killing, if it went unavenged, would bring a curse upon the village. The unrelenting web of influence created around the boy eventually results in his loss of self-control and subsequent shooting of his mother. The novel is a powerful indictment of local value culture, retaining its primitive concern with the primacy of custom over human life. The issues raised here are somewhat the converse of those raised by earlier village novels in which the peasant community as whole was represented as being helpless in the face of socio-economic develpments. Kill the Serpent focuses on the degree of dehumanization which a community rigidly bound by its conservatism is capable of reaching. With this book realism in Turkish fiction comes full circle, but freed from the last vestiges of romanticism. There is no glorification of hero worship, nor is there a Utopian suggestion of alternatives, but a stark rendition of how an individual can be conditioned by the 12</page><page sequence="8">environment. Violence in the Turkish novel is not depicted as a manifestation of an inherent human defect, but appears as having stemmed from one kind of social problem or another. In the political sense, it probes into the question of revolutionary behavior by reflecting the rising expectations of the laboring classes in a rapidly developing country, and thereby serves a vital function in communicating the needs and frustrations of a broad segment of society.11 In the socio-cultural sense these develop- ments within modern Turkish fiction suggest that a society can attain a level of ideological rigidity that negates human values.
