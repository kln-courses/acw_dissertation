MAN, I958, I3, 39, 64, I73; '959, '37 20 9 SIR,-I am grateful to Dr. Bushnell for drawing my attention to a bronze mould at Cambridge with a part-cast in lead within it. His dislike of what he calls my 'cavalier treatment of Mr. Hodges' does not impress me. After all, my 'treatment' was in reply to Mr. Hodges's treatment. There may be little justification for either, but surely there can be no less for defence than for aggression. Dr. Bushnell's second point (and Mr. Hodges's No. 5) concerns his 200 socketed axeheads, 'the whole lot' of which exhibits cast seams. These will appear alike on direct bronze casts and upon wax models cast in two-piece moulds to be inserted in one-piece clay moulds. Complete removal of these seams is far easier in the bronze than in the wax. The only exceptions to the presence of seams will be (there are very few) bronze axeheads upon which chasing after casting has entirely removed them. When such examples are found (I have seen one or two), they exhibit a first step taken to give a perfection of form far beyond the practical requirement demanded by this tool's normal function; the first step in fact towards those more elaborate non-functional features of the ceremonial toolform. What interests more than the seams at Cambridge is this part-cast in lead, which I hope to be able to examine on the first opportunity. Lead is one of the substitutes for wax in the reproduction of models formed in moulds, which no doubt was experimented with if not used where and when beeswax was in short supply. I have used lead in place of wax in casting my own sculpture, and found that it has limitations for my purpose. But it is possible that these limi- tations do not apply to forms so simple as the axehead. In any case the use of lead or other substitutes for wax in no way affects the advantages offered by the perdue process, though lead does give evidence of the indirect use of bronze moulds, of a kind which could not be expected from perishable wax. Another reader of MAN wrote to me suggesting deer fat as a substitute for beeswax. I have been unable to obtain any and would be pleased if any other reader could help me to obtain a small quantity-say a or I lb. There are of course tallow and stearine (obtainable from mutton fat) and shell casting in beeswax to eke out its short supply. When I have seen the lead cast in Cambridge and repeated what I conceive to have been its purpose in my studio, I will give my views on it in a subsequent issue of MAN. About IO years ago I began casting my own bronzes, after chasing for about 20 years commercial casts of my models made in art bronze foundries. My researches led me back to the practices in the bronze ages and to the realization that these were first and best-if we set aside all modern econoomic considerations. As I proceeded, it became ever more clear to me that there was only one ancient practice at a time between both tool-maker and sculptor; and that in pursuing the technique of the one craftsman one arrived at that of the other. There is some difference of course if one bears in mind the tool-maker's greater urge to facilitate quantity pro- duction on a far greater scale than the sculptor's. London, W.I4 LEON UNDERWOOD Note Mr. William Fagg, British Museum, adds the following note with reference to the last paragraph of his contribution to MAN, I958, I73: 'I regret that, relying on the internal evidence of his letter, I did Mr. Hodges an injustice in implying that he had perhaps not examined the axehead from Ur before contradicting Mr. Underwood's interpretation of it. But the knowledge that he was in fact quite familiar with it serves, I am afraid, only to deepen my amazement: I do not see how one can accept his inter- pretation (however defensible it may be in terms of the physical sciences) without attributing to the corrosive forces of nature an anthropomorphic purpose and thus subscribing to the pathetic fallacy.'-ED.</page></plain_text>
