Pp. xxxviii + 518. Cloth $32.50; paper $19.75. As the title and subtitle suggest, De Vries has written a book in which he attempts to speak about both "biblical religion" and "Old Testament theology." His approach is "biblical" in that he affirms a scriptural canon. The book's focus is on the "Old Testament," with the recognition that the OT does not exhaust the content of biblical religion. Each chapter includes brief discussions of NT concerns in order to show lines of development and continuity. In his concern for biblical "religion" De V. compares the developing religious ideas and practices in the OT with ancient Near</page><page sequence="2">318 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 47, 1985 Eastern literature. His "theological" objective is reflected in a quest for the normative elements in the Bible. De V. claims that modern critical methods enable one to recover the great "achievements" of ancient Israelite faith stripped of distortions produced by centuries of interpretation, and thus to appropriate those achievements for today. De Vries hopes to find "the true center of gravity within the Old Testament, and within Scripture as a whole" (p. 27). Wanting to avoid previous excesses, he follows Terrien in attempting to bridge the gap between "religious growth" and "theological tradition." His method, then, is a modified synthesis of approaches that seek "a thematic principle of unity" (Eichrodt, Vriezen), "a process of religious growth" (Koehler, Procksch), and "a process of theological tradition" (von Rad). To identify the normative elements in the Bible, De V. looks for the intersection of two axes: "that which accounts for biblical continuity amidst all its discontinuity"; and "that which accounts for those truly distinctive elements of biblical faith that emerge from the midst of the commonality shared with its ancient cultural environ- ment" (p. 487). That normativeness is to be discovered in the experience and interpre- tation of revelatory events. Contemporary theology and biblical exegesis converge, therefore, in the historical and existential continuity of human and divine encounter. Thus, at the heart of biblical faith De V. discerns a thread of "monotheistic personal- ism" that finds expression in five areas, which provide the structure for the book. 1. The transcendence and immanence of the biblical God. Over against the "im- manentistic monism" of extrabiblical religion with its anthropomorphic caricature of cosmic force, chap. 1 describes the God of Israel as "the holy God," one whose sovereign otherness is modeled in the image of lordship, and whose concern for human needs is reflected in the image of fatherhood /parenting. 2. The concept of a divine image mirrored in human personhood. Chap. 2 deals with the traditional categories of anthropology, hamartiology, and soteriology. Human beings are radically theomorphic in a personalistic and relational sense. They are also responsible and capable of bringing wrath or judgment on themselves. Yet before "a righteous God" who is not bound to a mechanical connection between sin and punish- ment, human beings find freedom for transformation. 3. Commitment to a life of fulfilling integrity within a covenant community. Under the rubric of "the jealous God," chap. 3 deals with the concepts of election and covenant. Unlike the ancient context, the divine election of Israel resulted in a pattern of life that permeated society - a pattern of mutual integrity (both divine and human) based on love and responsibility. Thus, election provided the theological framework for biblical ethics. 4. An understanding of history as responsible dialogue with God. Recognizing similar concepts of divine agency in the ancient Near East, De V. describes in chap. 4 how only Israel made a significant place for responsible human partnership within the purposeful activity of "the living God" in the cosmic drama of shaping history. 5. A sense of meaning and purpose in the evils of finite existence. In chap. 5 De V. deals with the meaning of life and death and the problems of suffering and evil. The biblical concept of life before "a caring God" transcends evil and conquers death. Among the non-distinctive elements in the OT, De V. lists supernaturalism, dependence on cultic atonement and ritual, legalism, and apocalyptic dualism and</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 319 futurism. Those, he claims, are "sub-biblical" and ought to be downplayed since each has been borrowed from the common cultural heritage or has arisen within biblical tradition as peripheral or temporary. The book contains intriguing insights in terms of both individual exegetical observations and broad theological synthesis, as well as several methodological weak- nesses. De. V. attempts to make numerous connections with contemporary theologi- cal concerns, some more successfully than others (see the discussions of the sexual imagery of divine fatherhood, male and female in biblical worship, christology, and the function of cultic ritual). The lengthy citation of ancient texts makes comparison accessible, but renders the book somewhat unwieldy. De V. is aware of the danger of over-schematizing ancient religions and creating artificial contrasts, but his own caveat is not always practically observed. Moreover, the criteria for normativeness (con- tinuity and distinctiveness) do not always yield an adequate "center of gravity" within the OT. Too much seems to fall by the way in the classification of certain themes as "sub-biblical" or of some texts as standing "outside the mainstream of biblical thought." A more extended analysis of the intersection of the five distinctive "theo- logical" elements with the material factors within Israel's own social, political, eco- nomic, and cultural life would have helped to explain more adequately the "achieve- ments" of ancient Israelite religion. Some may also wish to question De V.'s claim that the latest critical tools are free from the distorting lenses that have plagued the past. Of one technical point the reader should be warned. In addition to the two pages of errata (approximately 1 50) included with the review copy, I discovered over 75 errors in typing and content. In spite of its flaws, De V.'s book is a laudable attempt to preserve the discipline of biblical theology while at the same time not disregarding the significant overlap of cultural, religious, and moral values in the ancient world. The book certainly has provided more than one would expect from a "prolegomenon" to OT theology. Gordon H. Matties, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37240</page></plain_text>
