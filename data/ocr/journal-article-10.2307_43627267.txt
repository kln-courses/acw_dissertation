<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gbaņali's Book of Counsel for Kings translated by F. R. C. Bagley. Published for the University of Durham by Oxford University Press, 1964. Ixxiv + 197. 63 s. AI-Ghazali is one of the most interesting figures in the history of mediieval Muslim thought. To the non-orientalist, western reader he is perhaps best known by his spiritual autobiography al-Munqidh min al-Dalal (The Deliverer from Error), a work which is just as moving as St. Augustine's Confessions and holds a position of parallel importance in the history of Muslim religious thought. Al-Ghazali, however, was a voluminous writer who dealt with most of the topics of the day. His book Counsel for Kings (in Arabic: Nasihat al-Mulufè), which is now available in English in the translation by Mr. F. R. C. Bagley, belongs to the mediaeval genre of Mirrors for Princes, which was one of the most popular genres of Arabic and Persian writings. It must, however, be admitted that, interesting as it is, Counsel for Kings is by no means among Ghazali's major works: it lacks the urgency and profundity of al-Munqidh, and the encyclopaedic inclusiveness and vast panoramic vision of Ihija' 'Ulum al-Din - even though it may still have some of the general characteristics of al-Ghazali's writings, particularly his almost morbid preoccupation with the subject of death. One is somewhat disappointed to find that a work, which professes to give counsel to rulers and was written by someone who clearly had a rigorous philoso- phical training like al-Ghazali, should omit to discuss basic questions like the theory of Caliphate and the relation between it and the powers that be. A partial explanation for this surprising omission is that the work was obviously designed as a popularization. The popularization can be seen in the first part of the book, in which the author gives a brief account of the basic elements of religious faith which should serve as the groundwork of the prince's policy. Here, as is befitting, the author gives a clear summary of matters he has dealt with more fully in his other writings. Addressing the 'King of the East', the early twelfth century</page><page sequence="2">158 Medium JEvum xxxv. 2 Saljuq ruler of Persia, Sultan Muhammad ibn Malikshah, the author begins by reminding him that all worldly riches have no real value, and that 'God's enduring gift is faith which is the eternal wealth' (p. 3). However, since God has chosen to bestow upon him abundant prosperity he should be thankful to Him and should tend the seed of faith which God has sown in his heart, nourish it with the water of justice and piety until it grows 'into a tree whose roots reach the bowels of the earth and whose branches reach the clouds of the sky* (P. 4). Continuing the metaphor the author states that the tree of faith has roots and branches. The roots, which are the principle of the creed, are ten in number. They are the belief in the Unity of God, the creator of the universe, in His freedom from all anthropomorphic attributes, in His omnipotence and omni- science, in the existence of everything in the universe through His will, in His ability to see and hear everything ('the sound of the foot of an ant walking on a dark night is not beyond his hearing, nor are the colour and shape of a worm below the ground beneath His sighť, p. 9), in His pre-eternal word revealed in the Torah, Gospels, Psalms, Koran and the Books of the Prophets, in His justice, in the next world, the Day of Judgement and Heaven and Hell and finally the belief that in His mercy God has disclosed His secrets to His Prophets in order to acquaint His creatures with the paths of happiness and unhappiness and that the last of the prophets in whom prophethood reached perfection is Muhammad. Whereas the roots of faith pertain to knowledge and belief, the branches relate to the ruler's actions. The branches are also ten in number, they are: (1) understanding the danger of authority, observance of justice and fear of the punishment of God, the source of authority; (2) constant turning to the devout 'Ulema (doctors of religion) for advice; (3) making sure that justice is observed by the staff; (4) not being dominated by pride, which causes anger and therefore revenge, and being tolerant and forgiving, for before he can master his subjects a ruler has to attain self-mastery (pp. 21, 24-5) ; (5) imagining himself in the position of his subjects before dealing with them; (6) preference for attending to petitioners at his court and redressing their grievances to occupying his time with supererogatory religious observances; (7) care not to form a habit of indulging his passions, e.g. in food and dress; (8) gende be- haviour towards the subjects; (9) seeking to keep all his subjects pleased and appointing trustworthy spies to inquire about his true standing among the people; (10) care never to transgress God's law and therefore to displease Him in seeking to please his subjects. The tree metaphor is further elaborated in the final section of Part I, which treats of 'the two springs which water faith' (pp. 31-44). The first of these is knowledge of this lower world, of what it is and why man has been brought to it, while the second is a constant and full realization of the fact of death. The former is explained by a series of analogies, also ten in number, and the latter is illustrated by five anecdotes. The analogies, by means of which earthly existence is described, contain, in fact, some of the most pleasurable passages in the whole book. They range from the conventional and straightforward picture of the world as a vicious and importunate woman, who tempts men and leads them to their destruction, to the charming and highly urbane picture</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 159 of human beings coming into this world as guests, who should learn to enjoy the good things provided by their host, then offer thanks and depart (pp. 35-6), or to an elaborate and vivid account of this world as an enchanting island in the ocean of eternity, which by its wonderful sights and sounds lures 'the ship's passengers' to their perdition - an account which could serve as a plot for an allegorical romance (pp. 36-7). The anecdotes which the author narrates as examples of the need for the realization of the fact of death all point vividly to the suddenness, imminence and inevitability of death, once the Angel of Death appears. It may strike the reader as strange and even a little inapt that in a book addressed to a monarch the author should emphasize so strongly the transitory nature of all earthly glory and the need to think constantly of death. The author's aim, however, is, as is clear from the concluding paragraph of Part I (p. 44), to stress the awful responsibility of kingship. Part II of the book, which generally deals with the more practical issues that concern the ruler, opens with a link between religion and authority and empha- sizes the theocratic nature of government. God has selected two classes of men and raised them above the rest of the sons of Adam, the prophets who are sent to guide His slaves to Him and the kings whom He chooses to protect men from one another. In accordance with Persian thought, al-Ghazali describes kings as Goďs shadows on earth, and here, as elsewhere, he quotes spurious hadiths (sayings of Muhammad) to support the Persian view of the divine right of kings. The king receives his power and authority directly from God to whom (and not to any of his subjects) he is responsible. This means that the king 'must be obeyed, honoured and loveď (p. 45), and here al-Ghazali is just as vehemently emphatic as the author of the Elizabethan homily on Obedience, in stating the view that it is sinful to disobey the king. The king, in turn, must be just and righteous, for 'the unjust Sultan is ill-starred and will have no endurance' (p. 46). Because they were just, the author says (thus revealing a Persian's pride in his civilization and cultural heritage), the Magians ruled for well nigh four thousand years. After an account of the genealogies of the kings of Persia, mythical and historical, going back to the children of Adam, the author proceeds to enumer- ate the qualities required of kings. These are not stated in an orderly fashion, but emerge from a number of anecdotes and traditions, which vary consider- ably in interest and profundity. In fact, unlike the first part of the book, which on the whole, is a discursive and systematic treatment of the subject, despite its traditional use of Zahlenspruche , revealed clearly in the author's favourite number 10, Part II belongs strictly speaking to the Adab tradition, the Arabic tradition of elegant writing, which consists mainly in compiling a number of anecdotes, wise sayings, witticisms and felicitous expressions under a certain heading, together with an ability to quote apt verses to illustrate a certain point. The most important of the qualities required of a king is justice, for it is chiefly responsible for the prosperity of the kingdom, and injustice is punished even in this world. Justice is the main theme that runs throughout the chapter on the Qualities Required of Kings, which occupies nearly one-third of the whole book, and which both begins and ends with anecdotes illustrating justice. Next is piety, for 'the piety of the people depends on the good character of the king' (p. 60), and the author goes so far as to say that 'good men are good L</page><page sequence="4">i6o Medium Mvum xxxv. 2 through the instrumentality of kings' (p. 62). Thus the absolute authority which the king holds is paralleled only by his almost equally absolute responsi- bility towards his subjects. In this respect one of his primary duties is to main- tain discipline, for on discipline depends the security of the world (p. 76), and royal weakness causes no less ruin than royal tyranny. The author quotes examples from history showing the need to enforce discipline even, surprisingly enough, at the expense of justice (p. 78). Among the qualities needed are courage, honesty, knowledge and the mastery of passions (especially anger) by reason, the last of which is cited time and time again. Some of these qualities seem to be ultimately of Platonic origin (pp. 72 ff.), but the author refers to a variety of authorities and historic figures ranging from Aristotle and Alexander the Great to Anushirwan and other Persian kings to Muslim rulers like Umar ibn al-Khattab and Umar ibn abd al- Aziz. He attributes to Socrates a statement to the effect that, besides valuing religion and justice, a good king will encourage learning and scholarship ('for knowledge will be the object of his quesť, p. 91) and patronize men of letters. A king should be easily approachable, as nothing is more damaging to the subjects and more prejudicial and sinister for the king than royal inaccessibility and seclusion (p. 95). Among the interesting bits of advice is that the king should not make war in person: 'His prestige will benefit if he does not, because many lives depend on his life and the welfare of his subjects lies in his survival" (p. 88). On the other hand, he is advised to adminis- ter justice personally and, wherever this is impracticable, to supervise its administration by others (p. 92). Also continual backgammon and chess play- ing, ball games, hunting and wine drinking 'do not befit the king* (p. 79). There are also some interesting remarks on the wise use of ambassadors (pp. 99 ff.). Another quality which the king must possess is magnanimity. This the author considers so important that he devotes a whole chapter to it. Mag- nanimity comes from self-respect, self-knowledge, self-restraint and courage and leads to munificence, generosity and giving on a large scale. The rest of Part II is taken up with a discussion of a number of topics, each in a separate chapter, under the following titles: On the Wazirate and the Character of Wazirs; On the Art of the Pen and the Functions of Secretaries; Citing Aphorisms of the Sages; On Intelligence and Intelligent Persons; On Women, their Good and Bad Points. The need for a King to have 'a virtuous, worthy and competent minister' (p. 106) is emphasized by the author, who points out how a king should choose his vizier and how he should treat him. Among the interesting points mentioned is that the minister should be 'learned, intelligent and old" (p. 108) 'because although a minister may be young and have intelligence, he will not have experience unless he is old, and the things which men learn from life cannot be taught them by any other man* (p. 109). The chapter on the Art of the Pen and the Functions of Secretaries opens with a eulogy of the pen, showing its exalted position in the Koran and quoting Galen as saying that it is superior to the sword. The author states what secretaries ought to know beside the art of writing; it is a fearful amount, ten things, which include knowledge of irrigation and canal-digging, lengths of day and night in winter and summer, 'the courses of the moon, stars and sun, and their conjunctions and oppositions', arithmetic, geometry, the science of calendars and dates; acquaintance with medicine and pharmacy, and skill in</page><page sequence="5">Reviews i6i versification and rhyme (p. 114). It is a short chapter in which the author concentrates largely on the secretary's ability to cut a pen properly, to write legibly and to tell what kind of ink and paper he should use: 'the paper must be glossy and of even texture. The ink ingredients must be properly dissolved* (p. 116). Chapter V, entitled (in the Arabic version) 'Citing Aphorisms of the Sages', is really a collection of wise saws that are not necessarily relevant to kings or kingship, but rove freely over all aspects of life, e.g. drinking, sleeping, bathing, dress, sexual intercourse, wives, children, etc. . . . They are attributed to sages, historical and mythical or half-mythical, e.g. Luqman, Socrates, Alexander, Hippocrates, Aristotle, Galen, Buzurgmihr and Anushirwan. This chapter is full of amusing details. For instance, Galen is claimed to have said that among the seven things that bring about forgetfulness is urinating into stagnant water, or looking too much at ruins, or laughter accompanied by loud guffaws (p. 140). Buzurgmihr, we are told, said that among the four things that keep the body broken is sexual intercourse with old women (p. 139). The chapter on Intelligence and Intelligent Persons is disappointing and one wonders if al-Ghazali could have written it. It has a number of trite remarks on the need for people to have intelligence in order to acquire good positions in the state and obtain favour with the king. The book ends with a chapter 'Describing women and their Good and Bad Points'. Again it is difficult to see its immediate relevance to the subject of kingship. In fact, because the last three chapters of the book deal with more general issues, which are by no means confined to kingship and rule, the incomplete title of the English translation is something of a misnomer, and the fuller title of the Bodleian Arabic manuscript: Kitab Nasihat al-Muluk wa kuli Ghani wa Sď luk (The Book of Counsel for Kings and for every Rich Man and Beggar) reflects more faithfully the nature of the contents of the book. In this last chapter the author expresses his view of the ideal woman: she should be prolific in child-bearing, her piety should come before her noble birth or beauty of her countenance, she should be chaste, faithful and obedient to her husband, be a good helpmate, offering him the right kind of advice, look after him and be constantly at the spinning wheel. Men should respect their wives and show them mercy, kindness and forbearance. To act fairly towards them, the author advises the husbands to bear in mind ten things related to the nature and position of women. He even regards keeping numerous concubines as 'not commendable'. Yet, at times, the author expresses a less sympathetic view of women, without showing any awareness of the inconsistency - a much more typical medieval view, familiar in the work of Aquinas, Augustine and St. Jerome, that regards women as evil and as given to niggardliness and cowardice (p. 163). Typical of the medieval passion for correspondences is the classifica- tion of women into ten species, the character of each 'corresponding to the distinctive quality of one of the animals' (p. 165) - the animals are the pig, the ape, the dog, the snake, the mule, the scorpion, the mouse, the pigeon, the fox and the sheep. Significantly enough it is the last, the woman who has the peculiarities of the sheep, that is 'blessed like the sheep', and that is because of her obedience, compassion and usefulness (p. 166). The same ambivalence is found in the conclusion of the chapter, which while claiming that 'the prosperity and peopling of the world depend on women (p. 172), ends with the sentence:</page><page sequence="6">i6z Medium ÍEvum xxxv. 2 'it is a fact that all the trials, misfortunes and woes which befall man come from women' and a short poem illustrating the same point. Inconsistencies of this kind are frequent in the book and they, together with a number of remarks singularly inapt in a work addressed to a king, like the one on the misfortunes that befall a man who is 'condemned to serve the Sultan' (p. 87) or that kings have no friends (p. 145), lend force to the possibility of interpolation, a point which the translator wisely does not dismiss. In fact, the question of the authenticity of the text, which is compli- cated by the existence of several manuscripts, both Persian and Arabic, has not been completely setded by the translator, who has not been able to collate these manuscripts. Mr. Bagley calls his translation 'provisional' (p. xxvi) because it is based only upon the Peisian text edited by Pro- fessor Huma'i and the Bodleian Arabic text edited by Dr. Isaacs. The book, however, contains a useful introduction which deals, among other things, with the historical background of Ghazali's life and writings, an analysis of the teachings of Nasihat al-Muluk, an account of the sources as well as the Arabic and Persian tradition of Mirrors for Princes. There are also informative notes and a biographical index, but unfortunately there is no subject index, a thing which would be most desirable in a book of this nature, which lacks systematic presentation. Also in the notes one would like to have seen a fuller discussion of the author's alleged sources. Mr. Bagley makes very little attempt to verify statements attributed by al-Ghazali to authorities like, e.g., Aristotle, or to relate them to their immediate or ultimate sources. I have not compared the translation with the original, but I find the repetition of 'Prince of the Believers' for the Arabic Amir al-Mu'minin rather tiresome. And was Majnun Layla a Pre-Islamic poet (p. 187)? (See Brockelman's Geschichte der Arabischen Literatur (1937) 1 81, where the date of his death is given as 147/764.) M. M. Badawi.</page></plain_text>
