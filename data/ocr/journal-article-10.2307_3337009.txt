WOMAN ETERNAL The Female Image in African Art Tambaran Gallery, New York November 19, 1991-February 29, 1992 A little Fon ibeji (cat. no. 15) inspired Maureen Zarember, working with the late Alfred L. Scheinberg and Allen Wardwell, to put to- gether this immensely enjoyable exhibition of female figurative sculptures. It is accompa- nied by an elegantly simple and well-illustrat- ed catalogue with an introduction by Wardwell and ancillary notes by Scheinberg and Zarember. (When Scheinberg became too ill to continue writing, his notes were completed by Zarember.) Although it was a relatively small exhibition, with twenty- seven pieces from Africa and three from Oceania, it included a large number of important works and encompassed an extraordinary variety of form. From the aris- tocratic-looking Lwena figure (cat. no. 17) strung with a profusion of multicolored beads and wearing a long narrow cloth wrapper, to the hunched Keaka figure (cat. no. 13) with its thick red encrustation, to the dynamic Senufo figure pictured on the cata- logue cover, "Woman Eternal" broke open limited definitions of femininity. Not just an exhibition of pretty faces or of mother-and-child figures, it was an explo- ration of female identity expressed in a vari- ety of sculptural forms. As suggested by the words Zarember chose to describe the little Fon figure, which include adjectives that usu- ally connote maleness-"erect, unabashedly demanding attention....[with] large thrusting breasts"-the exhibition gave femininity free rein. This description, like the carving itself, reminds me of the Jenny Holzerism "Raise boys and girls the same way." Even though the Fon figure is decidedly female, in it mas- culine and feminine forms mix. The artist who carved this figure used a rather mascu- line sculptural vocabulary to define the female body. The sculpture has personality. So do all the others, and none are alike. The Dogon figure (cat. no. 1), in contrast to the Fon figure, is delicate and fragile. Its long, slender limbs are animated by an asym- metry that appears to set the sculpture in motion. The Senufo carving (cat. no. 4) shares some of these characteristics, yet its dy- namism is more aggressive. The Senufo word used to describe sculptures like this one is "nayiliwe" ("youthful")-fresh, vigorous, seductively attractive to the eye" (Anita Glaze, "Dialects of Gender in Senufo Mas- querades," African Arts, May 1986, p. 34). A similar concept is expressed in the Bamana figure (cat. no. 16), called nyeleniw or nyeleni, meaning "pretty little one" or "little orna- ment" (Kate Ezra, A Human Ideal in African Art: Bamana Figurative Sculpture, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., 1986). All three figures share a similar sensibility and describe a particular aspect of female identi- ty, one that can be communicated cross-cul- turally within the Western Sudan-and perhaps beyond. The figure from Papua New Guinea (cat. no. 24) presents an altogether different expression. The piercing stare of its almost opalescent glass-bead eyes intimidates. In Zarember's words, "She's a very tough lady...and one of three by a known hand." Other particularly important pieces include the elegant Mangbetu ceramic (cat. no. 10), with its finely incised surface; the skillfully carved, heavily encrusted Fon fig- ure (cat. no. 6), loaded with tiny gourds, small animal skulls, feathers, and other mate- rials; and the cubistic Bamana figure (cat. no. 2), whose hips form a cave-like hollow below a long, rectangular Modigliani-like torso. The exhibition spilled into all corners of the gallery and comprised a number of pieces that are not illustrated in the catalogue. Unillustrated medium-sized sculptures include a beautifully carved Yoruba kneeling female figure whose shiny, almost bluish- black patina makes its large lustrous eyes look as though they can actually see, and a lovely anthropomorphic Dan spoon, of the type that stands on its own two feet. Of the larger unillustrated pieces, one of my person- al favorites is the janus ceramic from Mali- overlooked by most visitors to the exhibition, according to Zarember. Placed peripherally, on the floor and in the corner, it may have been the only figure in the exhibition made by a woman. With eyes daubed in bright white, perhaps connoting supernatural vision, it qui- etly watched all that passed before it. Of the delightful array of smaller pieces, some are pictured in the catalogue and some are not. Neither the very unusual small Yoruba stone sculpture with its self-con- tained gaze, the Senufo heddle pulley with the face of a bird and conical breasts, nor a number of other miniature works of art are illustrated. Like the twin figures from Togo whose jaws-to a Western eye-appear to be set wide in laughter (cat. no. 23), many of these smaller pieces brim with character. Dedicated "to all the women of the world-past, present, future-may their spir- its forever soar," "Women Eternal: The Female Image in African Art" achieved its purpose. I wrote these notes to the accompa- niment of the soaring voices of young black female hip-hop pop-radio singers. The two activities complemented one another and made me think about how in reality these two worlds-of African-art dealers and col- lectors, and of urban America's young black populations--don't often intersect. Present- ing an unusually broad range of positive images of African women, from woman war- riors to nourishers of the community, the exhibition had great didactic potential, even though that was not its primary purpose. Its catalogue, which is already circulating wide- ly, will allow the exhibition's educational potential to be further realized. Carol A.
