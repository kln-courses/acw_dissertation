Lesure1 Many of the theories that inspire agency approaches in archaeology identify deep philosophical problems with other lines of thought. This creates challenges for identifying methods: do radical theories require radical methods? Choosing as a case study one of agency s interpretive frameworks (embodiment) and, further, a single class of evidence (anthropomorphic imagery), I argue that the answer is "no? In this case, familiar art historical methods, deliberately played off one against the other, provide a middle range framework for linking theory and evidence. KEY WORDS: agency; embodiment; figurines; style. Archaeologists interested in human agency have searched for theoretical approaches to people as thinking, feeling, acting subjects. Of particular interest are nuanced formulations of the complex interplay between agency and structure? between people as creative, strategizing subjects and those forces that shape, constrain, and even constitute their subjectivities. The human body is a recurring theme in such formulations, particularly the notion that agency and subjectivity do not float freely in discursive awareness but are instead more deeply embodied. The works of mid-to-late twentieth-century theorists such as Pierre Bourdieu, Paul Connerton, Mary Douglas, Michel Foucault, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty have been influential in the development of theories of embodiment, as have those of some more recent gender theorists, particularly Judith Butler (for overviews see Shilling, 1993; Strathern, 1996; Breen and Blumenfeld, 2005). Locating subjectivity in the body raises hopes for overcoming tena cious dichotomies?mind-vs.-body, thought-vs.-action, reason-vs.-emotion?that department of Anthropology, University of California, Los Angeles, 341 Haines Hall, Los Angeles, California 90095-1553; e-mail: lesure@ucla.edu. 237 1072-5369/05/0900-0237/0 ? 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">238 Lesure bedevil theories of agency. Consideration of the body directs our attention to skills, dispositions, and habits. Those can be considered forms of knowledge, but they are not fully open to conscious reflection on the part of social actors. Their resulting "naturalness" has implications for understandings of social relations, politics, and the perpetuation of practices. Further, the physicality of the body can help us out of theoretical ruts both idealist and materialist because it is not inertly material but implies action in the world. As a consequence, gender can be conceived of as physical and yet not reducible to morphology. It is performed?created through actions in particular contexts. These kinds of considerations characterize an increasingly popular theoret ical agenda for pursuing agency in archaeology (for overviews, see Fisher and Loren, 2003; Hamilakis et al, 2002; Meskell, 2000). Of the many sources of ar chaeological evidence relevant to theories of embodiment, human representations are of particular interest. Ancient human images provide tantalizing views from "within"?opportunities to glimpse how ancient people represented themselves to themselves. Images, though, are unlikely to have been simple reflections of a social "reality." Through a combination of iconicity and materiality, images help create subjectivities?they shape peoples' embodied experience by providing en during points of reference both discursive and affective (Hamilakis et al, 2002, p. 4; Joyce, 2000, pp. 8-9, 15-17). Whether we begin with embodiment and take up imagery to further our theoretical agenda or, instead, start with some collection of representations and seize on embodiment as an interpretive tool, we run into the same question: how is theory to be convincingly linked to evidence? Establishing the link proves a challenge. It is not uncommon to read through an article with the nagging sense that, during the encounter with evidence, theo rized propositions were never placed in serious jeopardy; a complex theoretical language was largely imposed on ambiguous data. Why does this problem recur? First, theories of embodiment, like others that archaeologists draw on in their exploration of agency, tend to be dense and replete with jargon. Just what would constitute proof or disproof of theory-laden propositions can be far from clear. Second, theories of embodiment are often exclusivist in tone. They purport to expose deep philosophical problems in alternative lines of thought. Cartesian di chotomies that rigidly separate mind and body come in for particular scorn. Such patterns of thought turn out to be covertly political?loci, for instance, for the perpetuation of androcentrism. In archaeological applications, theoretical exclu sivism often filters down to an analytical level, with alternative interpretations of the material record exposed as hopelessly flawed. For instance, Knapp and Meskell (1997, p. 191) find that previous interpretations of Bronze Age Cypriot figurines as goddesses or simply generic females perpetuate "totalizing discourses." "What is required," these authors suggest, "is nothing short of a paradigm shift, from the automatic designation of deity to a nuanced consideration of the representation of self."</page><page sequence="3">Iconography, Style, and Theories of Embodiment 239 Here, theoretical exclusivism seems to imply methodological exclusivism. From this perspective, when we adopt embodiment?a radically new theoretical understanding?we embrace a brand-new analytical framework. Such a move has negative consequences. It discourages attempts to build on previous scholarship (since that work is so hopelessly flawed). As a result, it puts rather daunting demands on the researcher. Path breaking innovation appears to be required at every analytical level. This may be a source of our problems: the complexity of theory combines with its exclusivist tone to magnify the data/theory gap. Yet exclusivism transferred from theory to analytical framework may be a mirage. New perspectives regularly call on familiar methods to link theory and evidence. The present paper makes that case for theories of embodiment with anthropomorphic imagery as evidence. I begin by sketching a strategy for linking theory and evidence in an interpretive landscape friendly to inclusion. Application to the problem at hand identifies style as a phenomenon of considerable interest. Long-standing interpretive debates surrounding style (in both archaeology and art history) are manifestations of just the sort of theoretical tensions at the core of the agenda of embodiment?but at a level of abstraction that encompasses concrete observations on objects. Thus, for theories of embodiment, debates surrounding style have a "middle range" quality to them. By turning to stylistic analysis for methodological inspiration, we establish links with previous scholarship, reduce the burdens of innovation implied by our theories, and enhance our ability to subject theorized propositions to empirical evaluation. More specifically, for the interpretation of anthropomorphic imagery, I argue that art historical methods of stylistic analysis and iconography provide tools for interpreting imagery from the perspective of embodiment. A brief example on small clay figurines of the Mesoamerican Formative period illustrates the sorts of concrete observations and interpretive insights I have in mind. STRATEGIES FOR LINKING THEORY AND METHOD Exclusivist theoretical positions identifying alternatives as hopelessly, even dangerously wrong are a legacy of archaeology's recent past. In the 1980s and '90s archaeologists commonly emphasized vast gulfs between theories. Compet ing perspectives were rhetorically fashioned as paradigms, hierarchically orga nized frameworks in which theory and method were integrated with high-level philosophical propositions. Choices among analytical procedures seemed to be determined by very general theoretical decisions, thus generating the exclusivist sense that radical theories required radically new methods. In the past 15 years or so, the exclusivist bastions have gradually crumbled (e.g., Kosso, 1991), and we have moved from a rhetoric of exclusivity towards one of inclusivity (Hegmon, 2003, pp. 216-218; Wylie, 2000, pp. 228-229). In such circumstances, claims of strict subservience of method to theory seem</page><page sequence="4">240 Lesure increasingly like a rhetorical chimera, a false pride of the paradigms. Now we choose pragmatically, even eclectically, among theories and methods, our choices dictated more by a reinvigorated empiricism than by concerns for paradigmatic coherence. It may be appropriate to think of the tools we enlist to link theory and evidence as analytical resources: we draw on them to meet our needs, but they preexist our own line of inquiry and may be used by others to further a quite different theoretical agenda. For example, consider iconography, an analytical framework from art history offering investigators tools for exploring what it is that representations depict (e.g., Panofsky, 1955, pp. 26-54). I argue that iconography is "middle range" since it links observations on objects to social insight. If the subject matter of images is relevant to our agenda, then iconography provides a pertinent analytical resource. Our theory may prompt us to choose it, but it exists independently, with its own traditions, debates, and baggage. The case of iconography is particularly striking since the "method" predates anthropological archaeology itself as a recognizable discipline. If we picture an interpretive field characterized not by competing paradigms, but instead by a chaotic jumble of analytical resources all available for use, middle range work takes on considerable challenges. The individual resources that we mix and match are products of distinct histories. To what extent do we need to worry about those histories as we pick our methods? Further, it would be naive to regard our selection of resources as unfettered. There are still logi cal entailments between analytical resources even if these are messier and less rigid then we imagined when we took paradigms to be advocacy positions. How do we be sure that our analytical framework is congruent with our theoretical agenda? Since both theories and data are varied in nature, no simple, unified solu tion exists. Instead, I identify strategies for work on theory-evidence linkages. First, it would seem useful to identify core theoretical insights and figure out how those manifest themselves at an analytical level. That would allow us to choose certain domains of material culture and?importantly?their associated interpretive traditions as particularly relevant. From that point, to choose an alytical resources we could take up the prescriptive approach favored by the paradigms: since theory prescribes method, we argue from theory to method. Prescription, however, is not the sole answer. We need a bottom-up complement to serve as an antidote to paradigmatic pride. To that end, I propose method ological exegesis, a scrutiny of exemplary studies for analytical procedures both explicit and implicit. There is not space here to justify this proposal at length; the basic idea is that there is an analytical richness to exemplary works that goes beyond even their own methodological prescriptions and constitutes a fer tile source for bottom-up insight (e.g., Salmon, 1976). My strategy for work ing out middle range linkages thus combines methodological prescription and exegesis.</page><page sequence="5">Iconography, Style, and Theories of Embodiment 241 EMBODIMENT AND STYLE The point of departure for theories of embodiment is an attack on approaches that set off "meaning" from a lived world (see Csordas, 1990; Strathern, 1996). Par ticular antipathy is directed at Cartesian dichotomies of mind/body, but others such as culture/nature come under assault as well. The human body?simultaneously thinking, feeling, and acting?provides a solution to dichotomous thinking. Cen tral themes include the roles of nondiscursive knowledge and bodily action in forming people as subjects. Habit and activity take on creative roles that overturn the inherent givens posited in mind/body dichotomies and yet help reveal how contingent relations of power are durably reproduced. Archaeologists are partic ularly drawn to the role given to materiality?to bodies, dressed and ornamented, manipulating objects in diverse settings (e.g., Joyce, 2000). Material culture here is no longer a residue. It is of direct theoretical importance, an active contributor to the constitution of subjectivities. All these themes are part of what I refer to as the "agenda" of embodiment theories, and our goal is to avoid simply imposing them on the evidence. Instead, we want to promote feedback between empirical findings and theorized proposi tions. In my concluding example, I will return briefly to the last theme of material culture and subjectivities, but the question here is how all these various themes manifest themselves at an analytical level. I am not referring to specific sorts of objects?clearly architecture, ornaments, etc., are relevant?but rather to dis courses involving interpretive responses to objects. One such discourse in which themes of great interest to embodiment theorists recur is debate over style. Relevant here are, first, the ways in which style as such is formulated in contrast to phe nomena deemed not stylistic and, second, divides over the understanding of style itself. In archaeology, style vs. function has proven a frustrating dichotomy that loosely echoes those attacked by embodiment perspectives. For instance, Cunningham (2003, p. 34) links the style/function divide to idealist/materialist tensions, while Dietler and Herbich (1998) add "technology" to make a prob lematic triad, then undermine it by drawing on theories of embodiment. Themes from archaeologists' understanding of style itself are also relevant. Styles can be conceived of as "ways of doing" that may be inculcated in dispositions and take on an aura of naturalness (Hodder, 1990 and, in different wording; Sack ed:, 1990). Style communicates or signifies, but rather differently than language. Senses, ambiguities, and intuitive graspings are particularly important (Dietler and Herbich, 1998, p. 244; Wiessner, 1990, pp. 106-107). "Ways of doing" can shift contextually from conscious to unconscious, thus creating a tension between active and passive use of style (Sackett, 1990; Wiessner, 1990; Wobst, 1999). All these themes, so relevant from the perspective of embodiment, are interwoven in the style literature with methodological controversies over the conversion of observations to evidence?how are style and function distributed across attributes,</page><page sequence="6">242 Lesure what are the referents of stylistic features, and how is attribute patterning generated in sequences of productive acts? Turning to style in art history, we find it associated with yet another long standing dichotomy: the opposition between form and content (Summers, 1989, pp. 372-379). This one is loosely analogous to style/function in archaeology: style (residing in form) becomes a vehicle for function (in tools) or subject matter (in art). In the next section I will argue that a form/content tension, manifested analytically in stylistic analysis and iconography, is of methodological interest in the study of anthropomorphic imagery. Themes from art historians' understandings of style itself again enter the territory of embodiment. Style can signify through nondiscursive means?the "emotional suggestiveness of forms" (Schapiro, 1953, p. 287). Styles of individual artists consist of "acquired disposition [s]" that are "not just psychological, but psychophysical" (Wollheim, 1979, p. 136). Bodily practices are thus again a theme. Style is a way of making (Gombrich, 1968), and attention to making lies at the heart of "facture," one recent approach to the analysis of form (Summers, 1989, pp. 397-398). Stylistic analysis is again identified as involving a tension between discursive and nondiscursive meanings (Winter, 1998). Finally, discourses on style are closely involved with formal analysis of art works. Core themes from the agenda of embodiment thus appear in the literature on style. Importantly, that literature is also richly methodological. From the per spective of embodiment, discourse on style is middle range since it provides an interpretive field in which theoretical claims are regularly linked to concrete observations on objects. ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORKS FOR INTERPRETING HUMAN IMAGES The literature on style is vast; we could find there a variety of analytical resources for linking embodiment to archaeological evidence. When the evidence in question is anthropomorphic imagery, however, our attention will necessarily be drawn to art historical writings on style. Two analytical resources offer important tools: stylistic analysis and iconography. Works interpreting anthropomorphic imagery from an embodiment perspec tive do not generally identify stylistic analysis and iconography as analytical resources. This is of concern, since from the perspective I develop here, grandiose claims of methodological innovation are to be regarded with suspicion. To advance my argument, I take up both prescription and exegesis. I begin in prescriptive mode by showing how the ambiguous border between these two approaches overlaps with interests of embodiment theories. Shifting to exegetical mode, I sketch briefly how theory-evidence linkages in one exemplary work are identifiable as iconogra phy, stylistic analysis, and, at higher analytical levels, a playing off of one against</page><page sequence="7">Iconography, Style, and Theories of Embodiment 243 the other. Thus, successful studies can be understood as already making use of these two analytical resources. Iconography I have already defined for my purposes here as the study of what representations depict (Panofsky, 1955; Roskill, 1989, pp. 94-98). A con sciously intended relation between image and subject matter is an important el ement. From the perspective of embodiment, a contrasting theme from the lit erature on style is striking: styles are particular ways of doing or, in the case of artworks, ways of making (Ackerman, 1963; Davis, 1990; Gombrich, 1968). Images in the same style were made in similar ways. Conceptualizing style in this way and juxtaposing it with iconography raises the specter of the much-reviled Cartesian dichotomies: iconography starts to sound like "thought" and style like "action." Are iconography and style, then, to be anathematized as the hopelessly flawed methods of our ignorant predecessors? That might be one approach in contempo rary art history, where legacies of the form/content divide generate much rolling of the eyes and a visual semiotics can appear preferable. It has long been rec ognized that subject matter can become style (Ackerman, 1963, pp. 167-168) and style, subject matter (Schapiro, 1953, p. 305). Semiotic approaches identify further problems with style and iconography. Many of these are specific to art history and not of great concern from an archaeologist's standpoint?for instance, evolutionary connotations of style, problems relating form to the "genius" of in dividuals or peoples, the narrowness of iconography's purported insistence that images acquire meaning through textual references, and the role of the art mar ket in the scholarly creation of styles (Alpers, 1979; Damisch, 1975; Summers, 1989). Other objections do resonate in archaeology, particularly those centering on iconography's assumption that the relations between signifier and signified are stable and straightforward. Instability of signification and multiple meanings for different audiences are instead themes of contemporary interest (Bal and Bryson, 1991; Damisch, 1975; Roskill, 1989, p. 98). It would thus be possible to embrace semiotics as the analytical framework of embodiment?and what I end up with could, I believe, be so labeled. The problem is that we would again be championing something cryptic and jargon laden. From the perspective of archaeology, we would seem to be claiming radical method as the necessary concomitant of radical theory, thus returning to where we began. There appears, however, to be another route. If we look deliberately to the unstable borderland between subject matter and style, it is possible to address certain critical insights from semiotics?for example, iconography's ignoring of signifier in favor of signified (Damisch, 1975, p. 30) and its insufficient attention to nondiscursive dimensions of meaning (Roskill, 1989, p. 98)?without giving up clarity and accessibility. A second theme from the literature on style is helpful here. Iconographie elements of an image reference content; they allow identification of the subject</page><page sequence="8">244 Lesure matter of the image. What are the referents of stylistic elements? The answer is that stylistic elements reference other images in the same style (Gell, 1998, pp. 162-163). This second way of conceptualizing the relation between iconogra phy and style has some interesting consequences. Iconography focuses on relations between an image and its intended subject. The focus of stylistic analysis is on relations between objects. What we identify as a "style" is our attempt to represent discursively certain intuitive processes prompted by confronting a series of similar objects. That which makes the objects similar we call "style" and we assert that it had some saliency in the lives of the original makers of the objects. In Gell's words, "artworks do not do their cognitive work in isolation; they function because they cooperate synergically with one another, and the basis of their synergic action is style" (1998, p. 163). By conceptualizing style as both as a way of making and a synergistic coop eration among objects and counterposing it with subject matter, we provide much of the analytical framework necessary to "do embodiment" in figurine studies. Importantly, these approaches operate on multiple analytical levels to help link theory-laden statements to concrete observations. My methodological exegeses of works applying embodiment theories to anthropomorphic imagery?focusing, I should admit, on ceramic figurines of prehistoric epochs but including multiple world areas?suggest that successful studies can be understood as already making use of these two analytical resources, irrespective of what they explicitly claim concerning methods. To illustrate that idea I turn to Rosemary Joyce's book Gender and Power in Prehispanic Mesoamerica. Joyce's discussion is heavily influenced by embodi ment theories; the work of Judith Butler and Paul Connerton she finds particularly helpful. I focused on sections in which Joyce interprets figurines of the Mesoamer ican Formative period. Passages in which she analyzes the formal qualities of figurines can indeed be identified as iconographie or stylistic in character, with, in addition, a close attention to archaeological context. Joyce is particularly attentive to what the images depict, developing an intriguing new (iconographie) interpre tation of the pervasive nudity of Formative figurines (Joyce, 2000, pp. 28-30). Relevant stylistic analyses might involve attention to techniques of fabrication (style in the sense of making) or an attempt to group similar objects into cate gories (style in the sense of synergistic cooperation among objects). If synergistic cooperation is of interest, the analyst begins with categorization, then attempts to identify principles constitutive of those categories. When Joyce (2000, p. 42) argues that contrasts in imagery between clay figurines and those of precious stone would have resonated with the difference in material to create new layers of meaning, she is making a stylistic argument concerning synergistic cooperation among objects. Joyce's concrete analyses of figurines may be iconographie and stylistic (with a strong dose of context). But what about more abstract levels of interpretation? If iconography and stylistic analysis really provide a structure for theory-evidence</page><page sequence="9">Iconography, Style, and Theories of Embodiment 245 links, they should also be at play in more theory-laden statements. To make that case, I look at the logic of a single passage from Joyce's book?a passage, though, that is both convincing and representative of the sort of insight an embodiment perspective might hope to provide in archaeology. Referring to the Playa de los Muertos figurines of Honduras, Joyce concludes that Body form, processing of hair, and ornamentation are combined to commemorate the gradual production of social persons, an activity concretized in the manipulation of clay to produce the figurines themselves. It is through the selective inscription in pottery figurines of specific gestures as typical of persons with particular sexual organs that apparently "natural" associations were made enduring parts of Ulua Valley concepts of gender. These permanent media, through which gender was materialized, stood in dynamic tension with actual performances within the settlement (Joyce, 2000, p. 38). The passage begins with the iconographie identification of what is depicted ("the gradual production of social persons") and then shifts to a stylistic em phasis on "concretized" making. It is this materiality with its ability to tran scend individual situations, together with the necessarily selective emphasis on particular gestures, which helped naturalize gender concepts. But what was it about the materiality that had such an effect? Wasn't it the synergistic coop eration among the objects?in short, style? Similarities among objects would have prompted the intuition that individual objects had synecdochic relations to something that made them similar. A "whole" (that we term style) would thus have been intuited from the relations among the individual objects, its "parts." What Joyce's argument implies is that this sense of a whole that was the in tuitive result of confrontation with figurines reflected back into social life to naturalize the association of "specific gestures" with "persons with particular sexual organs." In the terms I am using here, her argument becomes a kind of iconography in reverse in which the intuitive identification of a style determi native of similarities among objects prompted inferences that individual young women were likewise parts of a whole. They were exemplars of a social cate gory with its own rules of comportment, its own abilities to both empower and constrain. In sum, what I am suggesting is that the argument in this passage moves from iconography, to style, and back to iconography. This kind of deliberate playing off of iconography and stylistic analysis is a means by which a central goal of embodiment theory?the destabilizing of the mind/body dichotomy, here mani fested at a lower analytical level as content/form?can be pursued in empirically rich archaeological research. Iconography and stylistic analysis provide a middle range framework for "doing embodiment" in the study of ancient imagery. This is particularly so when we use the two jointly to look to a tension between subject matter and style. Following a distinction made by Winter (1998, p. 56), I will refer to this as a tension between "meaning" and "making," where meaning is to be understood as "discursively manifest meaning." The idea, of course, is not to resurrect a dichotomy but to posit a dynamic tension.</page><page sequence="10">246 Lesure EXAMPLE: FIGURINES OF THE MESOAMERICAN FORMATIVE PERIOD To illustrate the kinds of interpretive insights that might emerge from explic itly adopting iconography and stylistic analyses as analytical resources, I turn to figurines of the Mesoamerican Formative period. Typically 5-15 cm in height, an thropomorphic figurines of clay were abundant household objects across much of Mesoamerica during Formative times, an epoch stretching from the development of sedentary villages to the rise of urban centers (1800 BC-AD 200). Figurines likely had a variety of uses in any one community, from household ritual objects to, potentially, toys. While styles can be conceived at a variety of scales, both within and across media, a fine scale of analysis centering on figurine types?"styles" in Davis's (1990, pp. 19-20) sense of polythetic sets of similar attributes explainable in relation to a common production system?highlights advantages of links to previous scholarship, illustrates the tension between subject matter and style, and provides a basis for exploring how core insights of embodiment theories might be subjected to greater empirical scrutiny. My focus is on a theme from embodiment of particular interest to archaeol ogists: the creative role of material culture in the realm of human agency. Specif ically relevant here is the idea that human images help constitute subjectivities. Because they are durable enough to transcend fleeting experience and recogniz able with deceptive ease as depictions of people (the argument goes), they figure in the naturalization of arbitrary categories. First, I make use of that argument, showing how new interpretations emerge when it is combined with traditional typological tools to enrich an iconographie study. Second, I tried to open up the embodiment argument to empirical assessment. The basic idea is that patterns of stylistic variation are not the same across Mesoamerica, raising the likelihood that the affective power of figurines varied as well. My suggestions along those lines are a research agenda rather than a finished argument, but such efforts are essential if agency theories are to be successful in archaeology. Types, Style, and Subject Matter in Central Mexico For Formative Mesoamerica, the epicenter of figurine typology is the high lands of Central Mexico. In the early decades of the twentieth century, Clarence Hay and George Vaillant created a two-level, alphanumeric classification for the Basin of Mexico and Morelos (e.g., Vaillant, 1930). With some important modifi cations, particularly by Reyna Robles (1971) and Niederberger (1976), the basic scheme is still in use today over a region exceeding 17,000 km2. S?nchez de la Barquera (1996) identifies some 40 distinct types and subtypes among Forma tive figurines from the Atlixco Valley, Puebla. Theoretically focused investiga tors are apt to dismiss this enterprise as mechanical and uninteresting, but it is</page><page sequence="11">Iconography, Style, and Theories of Embodiment 247 worth a second look. Important types have a coherence suggestive of rigid con ventionality. They are certainly time-sensitive, and archaeologists have exploited them for that end. But if we look for a tension between meaning and making, it is possible to extract social insight from what have been treated as empty traits. In the Apizaco region of central Tlaxcala, I have excavated over 100 figurines of what I call the Cuatlapanga type, a manifestation of the Cl type in the Hay Vaillant scheme, predominant in local assemblages from 800 to 600 B.C. The type is defined by numerous themes and traits (Fig. 1). Body and head are conceived two-dimensionally and are coterminous, with little or no indication of neck. The head is exaggerated in relation to the body, with the forehead soaring above the face to provide a base for an elaborate headdress. Headdresses and other features are built up by appliqu? fillets that are not smoothed in. Eyes are indicated by two impressions at the base of a single horizontal fillet, yielding a heavy eyebrow. Mouths are formed by a rounded tab of clay impressed in its upper part to give the appearance of a heavy chin. Paste color, surface treatment, and the form of noses, legs, and ornaments also vary within a narrow range. One avenue to social interpretation would be to focus on subject matter. The figurines depict people as stereotyped social actors, their bodies revealed and hair elaborately coifed in a manner generally reminiscent of the cases analyzed by Joyce (1998, 2000, 2003). In the Cuatlapanga type, sexual attributes are stylized and uniform (Fig. 1, top and middle rows). A pair of small balls of clay on the upper chest I consider female breasts (78% of bodies). A single ball of clay in the pubic area I read as male genitals (11%). Such stylization would appear to provide little basis for age differentiation among the images, and a consideration of other features (particularly headdresses and overall size) reinforces that idea. Approximately 90% of the figures appear to be sexual mature (but still young?) females and males otherwise undifferentiated as to age. Some diminutive sexless figures are probably babies or small children. The few sexless adults do not form a coherent grouping. A reading (based on such iconographie observations) of the role of this assemblage in the shaping of ancient subjectivities would surely build on the simple, stylized coding of gender/age to emphasize a sense of conventionality. Convention among figurines, we might argue, would have promoted conformity to stereotyped roles. More subtle social insights emerge from a finer grain of iconographie anal ysis and a consideration of the potential for amplification of meaning through synergistic cooperation among the figurines. One place to look for tension be tween subject matter and style is in violations of standard conventions. The eye form of Cuatlapanga figurines is perhaps the most characteristic attribute of the type. The eyes of figure after figure are virtually identical, giving the impression of monotonous conventionality. There are, however, three cases in my collection in which eye form deviates from this norm but other traits warrant assignment to Cuatlapanga. The deviant form is the same in all three?a ball of clay with</page><page sequence="12">248 Lesure Fig. 1. Cuatlapanga figurines from Apizaco region, Tlaxcala, Mexico (ceramic, ca. 800-600 BC).

All three of these also have radically deviant faces. Given widespread representational conventions in Formative highland Mexico, it is likely that these are depictions of people wearing masks (see Coe, 1965, Figs. 151, 157; Marcus, 1998, Figs. 8.31-8.32). Although figurines are common finds, the deviant eyes are rare. In the social contexts in which people displayed Cuatlapanga figurines, the standard eye form would have receded into the background beneath the elaborate headdresses, an arti fact of making that referenced a monotonous series of identical eyes. Nevertheless, deviant eyes would occasionally have dragged that monotony to the foreground. Surely, in contrast with the eyes of masked figures, the standard form took on a discursive meaning: "human." Figurines with masks depicted people transformed, no longer "human." They were given different eyes?as were the few animal fig urines (typically dogs or birds) found in association with Cuatlapanga figurines. In other words, the eyes of Cuatlapanga figures would have been caught up in a ten sion between meaning and making, their implications amplified nondiscursively. Eyes mainly referenced other, identical eyes, promoting intuitive identification of a "whole," of which individual figurines were parts. The affective power of devia tions would have been enhanced by the monotony of the norm against which they stood, but their iconographie character?the fact that they systematically appeared on masked faces?would simultaneously have shifted the intuited whole of the style into the realm of discursive meaning. Here, even figurine eye form?the consummate typological trait of the For mative, routinely treated as devoid of meaning beyond the taxonomic?takes on a theoretical interest. Similarities among objects prompt people to sense a whole that is style and, via the iconic relation between image and subject, intuit analogous "wholes" in societies. Further, styles are polythetic sets: differentiated wholes. Patterns of similarity and difference among images can promote intuitions? ideologically charged intuitions?of a similarly differentiated social whole. This is particularly the case when, as in the case of Cuatlapanga eye forms, discursive meaning is amplified nondiscursively by tensions between meaning and making. Thus, a cognitive confrontation with Cuatlapanga figurines as a differenti ated whole might have provided amplification or counterpoint for more manifest meanings. How do such considerations relate to our original iconographie reading of Cuatlapanga figurines as a constraining force in the formation of subjectiv ities? Certainly, the theme of conventionality recurs?it was the rigidity of the norm that would have given deviant eyes their power. But when we look deeper, there appears to be no effort to harness nondiscursive dimensions of meaning to an ideology of social constraint. For instance, masks with deviant eyes are associated with both "female breasts" (two cases) and "male genitals" (1 case). The affectively amplified distinction between human and transformed human did not correlate with a distinction between female and male. Similar patterns hold among other classes of attribute, such as gesture, posture, and the headdresses of</page><page sequence="14">250 Lesure figurines with standard eyes. There is no hint of redundant patterning that might have given resonance to the categories "female" and "male." Although what I read as attributes of femaleness and maleness for this type are highly conventionalized, and images of females greatly outnumber images of males, the affective power of style was not employed in ways that would have promoted the inculcation of these categories. In other words, there is no evidence for nondiscursive reinforcement of gendered divisions of comportment or social role. The only gender ideology that could plausibly have been affectively amplified by this sort of synergistic cooper ation among Cuatlapanga figurines would have been one of fluidity or inclusion. It would be unacceptable to jump from there to a claim that figurines directly re flected a social "reality" in Apizaco communities. It does seem possible to argue, though, that figurines were ambiguous and in some contexts perhaps empowering accouterments of human subjectivity. Stylistic Variation and the Agenda of Embodiment The idea that images help shape embodied experience has prompted in triguing insights into Cuatlapanga figurines. But to what extent can this tenet of embodiment theory itself be subjected to empirical assessment? I sketch out some possibilities here by building directly on the discussion of figurine types in the last section, thus furthering my claim that methodological links with previous scholarship help promote this kind of scrutiny of theory. Our goal is to avoid letting theoretical insights become generic claims ("all images shape subjectivities") by promoting feedback between theory and evidence. It would be naive to think that such general propositions would sink or swim based on a single archaeological case. Instead, I argue simply that we might be able to assess the robustness or power of core insights from embodiment theory by exploring their effectiveness as predictive tools. For instance, if embodiment theory's claims of feedback between images and subjectivities are sound, are there other propositions that also should hold, perhaps at a lower level of generality? I suggest that there are. To explore the possibility I return to the theme of figurine types as micro-styles. The Formative period in Central Mexico is known for its typological diversity. Much of the variation is chronological, but there is also evidence for synchronie cooccurrence of multiple figurine types in the same community or household. In Apizaco, we often find at least two types represented in refuse pits from a single phase. At Tlatilco in the Basin of Mexico, figurine offerings in a single burial were sometimes of more than one type (e.g., Burial 86 in Garcia Moll et al, 1991). To the south, in the Valley of Oaxaca, Marcus (1998, p. 48) sometimes found two styles of figurine on the same house floor. The implications are that there were social settings in which figurines of distinct styles appeared together. Thus far I have considered only synergistic cooperation within a type. What about cooperation between types?</page><page sequence="15">Iconography, Style, and Theories of Embodiment 251 From the perspective of embodiment, such situations are intriguing because the affective implications of styles-in-juxtaposition should have impinged on em bodied experience. Caution is in order here, since sloppily defined types and residual categories are unacceptable; we seek conventionalized types with dis tinctive patterning involving multiple features and narrow ranges of attribute variation for each one. If we argue along the lines followed by Joyce (2000) that figurines helped to provide shared standards against which people's actual performances were evaluated, then divergent possibilities present themselves. Do multiple styles imply multiple, contested standards, a fluidity of discourse in which hegemony could be contested and potentially overturned? Or, alternatively, was this fluidity of style a kind of fa?ade in which the dramatic contestabil ity of certain sets of standards served to further obscure other, more insidious ones? I do not have definitive answers. For the collection that includes Cuatla panga figures, I suspect that a bit of both were involved but that the first question does get at something important about this and other assemblages from Central Mexico. Persistent juxtapositions of internally coherent but strikingly different types do suggest an engagement on the part of villagers with distinct "ways of being." Expanding the geographic scale of inquiry raises further intriguing questions. Formative figurines across Mesoamerica share certain broad similarities, but the "type-ability" of assemblages differs by time and place. Central Mexico is one of the more dramatic cases in which highly distinctive styles were in use contem poraneously within individual communities. The situation was different in Early Formative Soconusco (Lesure, 1997, 1999). While there was never complete ho mogeneity, stylistic variation was less coherent and less extreme than in Central Mexico and typological distinctions tend to center around differences of subject matter. Similar patterns seem to hold at the later Middle Formative site of La Blanca, also in the Soconusco (head types 7 and 9 in Arroyo [2002] seem likely to correspond to variations in manifest meanings). A wider investigation might well reveal a tendency towards synchronie stylistic homogeneity more broadly across southeastern Mesoamerica. In Honduras, Joyce (2003, pp. 248, 251-256) notes previous claims that Playa de los Muertos figurines were untypeable, and her own distinctions center on subject matter. Certainly, no equivalent to the Hay-Vaillant scheme has ever emerged for southeastern Mesoamerica. In comparison to Central Mexico, styles are less coherent in terms of attribute patterning, more homoge neous at the local level, and more restricted in areal extent. We might say that the grain of stylistic variation was different in the two areas. Further, these patterns persisted over time as durable characteristics of the figurine-making traditions. It is tempting to go further and argue that synergistic cooperation among figurines should have had a different character in the two areas. With that step taken, we can turn back and contemplate the predictive power of a core insight from embodiment theory.</page><page sequence="16">252 Lesure If the shaping of subjectivities through images is a powerful theoretical in sight, it should help make sense of such variation. Surely the Highland Mexico situation?in which figurine styles were internally more rule-bound and externally more often in juxtaposition with other, equally rule-bound styles?would have provided a greater scope for negotiating or contesting shared standards through a dynamic interplay of manifest and subliminal meanings. We would expect evi dence that people in Central Mexico actually exploited those dimensions of their image-making traditions; lack of such evidence would be something of a strike against the interpretive power of embodiment theory in archaeology. Coming up with such evidence may well prove a challenge, though I hope soon to be able to do so at a fine grain of detail in my Apizaco collection. In the meantime, it is possible to cite a general pattern that might support the expectations I claim based on embodiment theory. Figurine traditions tend to peter out in the later Formative of southeastern Mesoamerica, whereas they continue in Central Mexico during the rise of urban centers, most famously at Teotihuacan. This could be because the manner in which these traditions were constituted in Central Mexico made them durably effective as material points of reference in the formation of subjectivities. CONCLUSIONS This paper has pursued several interlocking goals. First, I considered the chal lenges of method in agency approaches to archaeology. Some popular theories are exclusivist in that they identify deep philosophical problems with other lines of thought. A tendency to transfer exclusivism from theory to method inhibits the development of agency approaches by creating unnecessary demands for inno vation and promoting a tendency to impose theory on evidence. Methodological work should instead look favorably on areas of overlap with previous scholarship. To further that goal, I proposed a dual approach to the identification of relevant analytical resources involving both prescription (arguing from theory to method) and exegesis (scrutinizing exemplary works). My second goal was to apply this approach to the development of linking ar guments for embodiment theories, with human imagery as evidence. Embodiment theories are of interest because they explore the interplay of agency and structure in ways that destabilize tenacious dichotomies like mind/body. Their exclusivist tone, however, brings with it all the disadvantages familiar more broadly in agency approaches. Application of my general scheme for methodological work led to the identification of debates over style as providing a "middle range" discourse in which themes of theoretical importance from an embodiment perspective were regularly linked to concrete observations on objects. For the specific case of an thropomorphic imagery, I identified the art historical frameworks of iconography and stylistic analysis as relevant, particularly when they are used together to look at a dynamic tension between style and subject matter.</page><page sequence="17">Iconography, Style, and Theories of Embodiment 253 Finally, I turned to my work on Mesoamerican figurines of the Formative pe riod to illustrate the potential advantages of explicitly embracing iconography and stylistic analysis as analytical resources. The overarching argument there was that traditional typological concerns might help an embodiment approach link theory and evidence. Typological tools proved of use in exploring the dynamic interplay of style and subject matter in a single figurine type from the Apizaco region of Central Mexico. But the diligent activities of traditional typologists?including the pattern of their successes and failures mapped out across Mesoamerica? are of more general interest. The character of variation in figurine style across Mesoamerica should have given this material medium varying potential in the realm of embodied experience. Such an observation challenges embodiment the ory to prove its worth by showing how general theoretical concepts might make sense of variation between cases.
