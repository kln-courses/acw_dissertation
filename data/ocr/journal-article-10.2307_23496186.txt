The pan-Chinese pantheon, including deities and buddhas from the Confucian, Buddhist, Daoist, and popular traditions, was formed during this period, and the Three Teachings show a marked syncretic tendency. The common people also adopted the standard rites of Confucianism, which had heretofore been those of the ruling class. Daoist and popular religious traditions that we can still find today also have their origin in the Song. Compared to earlier periods, the Song has more historical sources through which to examine the real state of popular religion. But many of these sources are fragmentary and strongly reflect the normative standards of Confucian officials. The present state of popular religion as reported by anthropologists or sociologists must therefore be taken into account to interpret Song period sources appropriately.1 Daoist ritual and magic During the Song ancient teachings were incorporated in the Daoist canon even as new traditions were formed. These included Thunder magic (lei fa 雷法）and Celestial Heart magic (tianxin fa 天心法)，as well as the practice of inner alchemy (neidan 內丹）through which internal vitality (jing 精)， energy (qi 氣)，and spirit (shen 芊申）were linked to the immortal body. Daoist rites have a very esoteric nature; without personal instruction, ritual texts cannot be understood accurately, so many studies in this field have been pursued by researchers who conduct field studies with Daoist masters. Maruyama Hiroshi focused on Jin Yunzhong 金允中，discussing his teach ings in his Shangqirig Lingbao dafa 上清靈寶大法 and their history.

Matsumoto Kóichi analyzed a new chain of rites in the Yellow Register Retreat (Huanglu zhai 黃籙齋）which developed in the Song，based on the Shangqing Lingbao dafa of Wang Qizhen 王契眞，and considered the mixing of Yellow Register Retreat rites with Confucian rites in popular funeral prac tices. Comparing the Daoist exercises of the Lingbao sect in Jin and Wangs versions of the Shangqing Lingbao dafa，he also analyzed the relationship between the two texts.2 As to Daoist magic, Matsumoto has explained Thunder magic and its theoretical foundation on the theories of inner alchemy. He argues that the development of Thunder magic was closely related to the establishment of the supremacy of the Celestial Master sect (Zhengyi pai 正一派）among the Daoists of south China. Yokote Yutaka has explained the history of Daoist rites that appeared in the writings of Bai Yuchan 白玉蟾，a prominent figure both in inner alchemy and Thunder magic, and Suzuki Takeo has analyzed in detail the composition of Thunder magic and its theory. Matsumoto has also analyzed the ritual processes of Celestial Heart magic，which similarly have a close connection with the Celestial Master sect, and pointed out that they imitated the examination of criminals by officials.3 Among studies on the Daoist canon，Miyazawa Seijun had presented a series of papers on the “Pivot of the Dao” (daoshu 道丰區），discussing such themes as textual studies, the composition of the whole section, and the major ideas in it. Yamada Shun discussed the thoughts of Chen Jingyuan 陳景元， a prominent annotator of the Daoist canon.4 2.

Fukui Fumimasa, for example, has pointed out its close connection with Chan Buddhism，and Azuma Juji has explored its underlying theory and history，showing why it appealed to the intelligentsia of this time despite its difficulty. Interpreting the succession of teachings of each master identified with the Southern Lineage, however, is one of the most important problems researchers studying the traditions of inner alchemy face. In one approach, Matsushita Michinobu has diagramed the alchemical exercises outlined in "Awakening to Perfection” that lead from the cultivation of ones life (ming 命，i.e.，inner alchemy) to the cultivation of ones nature (xing 性，i.e., Chan Buddhism), and through this has explored the relationship between the two. He then discussed the efforts of Zhang Boduans successors to transcend this framework, citing for example Bai Yuchan who adopted cultivation of ones nature through Daoist inner alchemy as his solution. Suzuki Takeo similarly diagramed the inner alchemical theories explained in the texts of the Zhong Lu 鍾呂 sect beside those of “Awakening to Perfection’’ and the works of Bai Yuchan, and asserted that Bais teachings emphasize not only the course of awakening to leave the phenomenal world to reach the Void (kong 空，i.e., “reality”）but also the process of movement between the phenomenal world and reality. Suzuki concluded that Bai most highly valued the ability to move freely in both directions, and argued that understanding this is important if one is to grasp the relationship of alchemical theory with Thunder magic.' Beyond the work focusing on Zhang's "Awakening to Perfection" scholars have identified three texts: “Complete Ritual of the Numinous Jewel" (Lingbao bifa 靈寶畢法)；"Dialogue between Zhong and Lu on the Transmission of 5.

The teachings expressed in these texts are often linked to the ZhongLu sect, but at present it has not been proven that these were written by masters of any one sect. Sakayauchi Hideo, however，concluded that the “Dialogue” was written in the latter half of the nth century, the “Record” in the latter half of the Northern Song, and then argued that the alchemical exercise of the "Amalgamation of Dragon and Tiger" (longhu jiaohe 育■虎交合）has its origin in the technique of circulation of the internal breath. Ishida Hidemi explained inner alchemical techniques very concretely through his analysis of the process described in the “Complete Ritual." Whereas most Japanese studies of the techniques of the inner alchemy tradition have focused on theoretical practice, Ishida alone has focused on the practical medical aspects of breath control，and greatly influenced later alchemical studies in Japan. As to other Complete Perfection sect masters，Yokote Yutaka studied the teachings of Li Daochun 李道純，who played an important role in the incorporation of Complete Perfection sect teachings into southern tradition of inner alchemy, and pointed out that Lis teachings introduced the practice of meditation on the venerable sayings of Chan masters (kanhua Zhan 看話吊單）.6 The history of the teachings of inner alchemy and the structure of its tech niques have also been extensively studied in China, where many researchers have presented new findings and views. It is generally recognized that inner alchemy was supported widely by the Song intelligentsia. But I think only a few were persuaded by the alchemical exercises and promise of longevity that proponents claimed could be attained through them. The question of what was most appealing about the teachings of inner alchemy to Song intelligentsia other than Daoist priests thus needs to be studied. Some have pointed out that in outer alchemy spiritual exercises are considered to be important, and in this area introductory exercises such as circulating the breath have already been studied. But the problem of the theoretical succession from outer alchemy to inner alchemy is still a theme for future work. 6. SakayauchiHideo坂内榮夫，「「鍾呂伝道集」¿内丹思想」，『中国思想研究』7(1985).

This is because histori cal sources which described local temple events increased in number, and many popular gods worshipped today in local temples and many of the ways by which they are worshipped had their origins in this period. The social structure of given localities is reflected in the organizations supporting local temple events. Much of the work of Sue Takashi has focused on the actions of the leading figures in local society, their relationship with central authority, and their concern with local temples. Sue has no rivals in the social historical approach to local temples in Japan. He has especially addressed the system whereby the state conferred legitimacy on local temples through grant of a tablet or a title, analyzing the procedure from its beginnings with the presen tation of a petition to the court by local community elites to the grant of an imperial title or tablet. This procedure was fully established by the end of the Northern Song or the beginning of the Southern Song. Sue has demonstrated that the central part in presenting a petition was played by prominent local leaders, in contrast to the Tang when local officials played the central role. As for the state system, Matsumoto Koichi has examined the Song dynasty's attempt to control local temples, and Kanai Noriyuki also has examined who played the central part in presenting a successful petition leading to the award of an imperial title. Sue has written of a local elite clan in Fujian surnamed Fang 方 who sought to confirm their status as local leaders by recording their contribution to a local temple. He analyzed records of temples concerning the rebellion of Fang La 方臘，in which fictional accounts were constructed [as though] on a factual basis，and pointed out that while in the discourses of temple inscriptions (miao ji 廟記）local interests are reflected, those of official temple documents (miao die 廟牒)had a strong tendency to reflect the Song courts concept of rule in regard to regional society.7 The main themes of Mizukoshi Tomos studies focus upon explaining what 7.

Mizukoshi has pointed out that the responsibility to discriminate between official，"or "legitimate" (zheng 正)，temples and those that remained unofficial，or "illegitimate" (yin 隱)，fell to the local elite. Thus the right to confer a table and a title, originally an important function of the state, gradu ally came to only confirm the decision of the local elites. Mizukoshi has analyzed the cult of the God of the Eastern Peak (Dongyue dadi 東嶽大帝)， a deity that originally held a position in the national pantheon, arguing that it became a popular god especially at prominent townships in south China because it offered a parallel that complemented the city gods (chenghuang 城隍）of the administrative core cities.8 Kanai Noriyuki has examined the classes that played central roles in local temple affairs，examining what kind of position the classes held in local society and why they supported the temples they did. He has argued that locally-influ ential families and clans cooperated with temple caretakers，maintaining that they intended to use their control over local temples to support their attempt to assert local control. Tanaka Isseis study of local temple festivals in the Song demonstrates that because of social change around the local temples，profes sional troupes became separated from the other participants in festivals，who became only spectators. His main concern has been to demonstrate that these professional troupes evolved to perform Yuan drama (Yuanqu 兀曲），but in his paper, based on Chen Chuns 陳淳 descriptions, he described the actual state of the festivals and the festival organization of Fujian local temples，and illuminated the social changes among community people who supported local temple affairs. His paper has greatly influenced subsequent temple studies]9 For the local people, however, temples were first of all the places where they could contact and worship spiritual beings such as gods, ghosts, and ancestors. Important events of the temple were organized around these requirements of the temple adherents, and in this sense the temple function has not changed from the Song period to the present.

He has pointed out that some local gods were originally considered to be angry ghosts，and noted the participation of shamans in the formation of their worship. As to the studies on the tendencies of these aspects in the Song period and their social background, Kanai Noriyuki has pointed to the transition from the worship of the altar of soil (she 社）in ancient times to the worship of the local temple gods, the syncretic tendency of the Three Teach ings in the expression of the popular religion, and the social classes who led local temple affairs. In order to address these problems, he has made full use of miscellaneous notes (biji xiaoshuo 筆記/J、說)，collected papers (wenji 文 集），and temple inscriptions. Like the work of Tanaka Issei, Kanais papers have had a great influence on the studies that have followed.10 Since the mid-1980s, Kanai has focused on the worship of regional gods (tushen 土宇申)，which he has defined as those gods whose temples united the temples of the old soil gods (i.e., she). He has maintained that the appear ance of these gods corresponded with the appearance of a new type of wor ship organization, the range of which Tanakas study would argue was based on commercial areas. Sue has also explored the tendency to transform soil gods into anthropomorphic gods (i.e.，“regional gods’’) and the background of this movement in local society. We must note, however，that many other researchers have not accepted Kanai s definition of ‘‘regional gods.” Kanai has written papers concerning the relationship between the worship of city gods and of angry ghosts (li gui 厲鬼）and on the worship of ghosts and specters, arguing that mountain goblins (shan xiao 山魈）and plague gods (wen shen 瘤神）came to be worshiped as temple gods. He has described the background of this tendency and argued that statesmen classified these gods as demons (mo 魔）or ghosts (gui 鬼)，and argued that the worship of these gods encouraged the illicit promotion of vegetarianism and demon worship (chicai shimo 喫菜事魔)as well as of human sacrifice and the worship of ghosts (sharen jigui 殺人祭鬼).Even as they grant that these themes are very interesting and important by themselves，his critics have maintained that his conception of angry ghosts，hungry ghosts (gu gui 孤魂）and specters (jing io. Matsumoto Kóchi,「宋代O祠廟¿：祭祀」，『図書館情報大学研究報告』20:1(2001)， and「宋代O社¿：祠廟」，『史境』38-390999);andKanaiNoriyuki，「社神¿道教」，『道教』 2 (1983).</page><page sequence="9">137 guai 精怪）remains confused，and that he has expressed his own opinions about the soil and grain gods (she ji 社稷），the soil god or temple gods (she shen 社神)，local temples (she miao 社廟)，and village temples (li she 里社） without clear definition of these terms and their mutual relationships.11 Finally, in such local temples shamans (wu 巫）and various popular priests or exorcists were active in their religious service. Nakamura Jihei has described the activities of shamans, especially their initiation process, their style of ser vice and existence，and the state control of shamans in the Southern Song. Kimura Akifumi has analyzed shamans’ curing activities as recorded in the Record of the Listener (Yijian zhi 夷堅志）and their relation with healers(yz 醫)，and discussed the views [of] the intelligentsia [about] them.12 In conclusion In Japanese studies on Daoism and popular religion, the Song has attracted attention as the period when new traditions that can still be detected today began to emerge. But in these studies，it is difficult to say that systematic ap proaches and studies have appeared. Despite the studies that are introduced in this paper, many original texts concerning inner alchemy and the Daoist rites and magic remain that have just begun to be investigated. Historical sources that tell us the real state of popular religious activity in the Song are few and fragmentary, but it can be said these sources have not been fully utilized. [Historical sources that illuminate the actual state of popular religious activity in the Song are few and fragmentary, but it can still be said these sources have not been fully utilized] I think, therefore, the researchers in this field need to cooperate to obtain a clear，shared historical picture of religions in Song China. íi.

This essay will consider two categories of such fiction，the literary and the colloquial. The latter is based on the colloquial style that originated with popular lectures in the amusement centers of the cities. The value of the colloquial story as an historical resource has recently attracted the attention of Song scholars in Japan. There are two reasons for this. First, the colloquial story took the city as its stage, accurately describing the manners and customs of the common people. Second, over one hundred such works survive, and they constitute a rich historical resource. Therefore, for the study of the common people for which sources are so rare the survival of so many examples of the colloquial story is good news indeed. However, the colloquial story is not the kind of historical source which historians, for whom recording things and phenomena is important, have commonly used. Hence, how to utilize the colloquial story as an historical resource is a big problem. The Experimental Efforts of Previous Studies Scholars such as Niida Noboru, who was not a social historian but a scholar of Chinas legal history，and Ishimoda Tadashi, a student of the Japanese middle ages, were among the first in Japan to try to apply fiction (xiaoshuo 小說）to the study of Chinas history, although such attempts were initially sporadic. In an essay published in 1937, Niida tried to consider how the events or behavior addressed in colloquial stories and operas were legally recognized.13 In an essay published in 1949 Ishimoda pointed out that "Cuo Ren Shi”「錯|忍屍」 from the Yu Chuang J i『雨窗集』，a collection of colloquial short stories， 13-仁井田陞，「中国近世戯曲小説乃中O私法」，『中田先生還暦祝賀法制史論集 (岩波書店，1937).</page><page sequence="11">BIBLIOGRAPHY OF SONG STUDIES IN JAPAN 139 contains valuable historical material, arguing that "the essence of the details of life was described …，[and] the typical character was skillfully portrayed." He praised “Cuo Ren Shi" as an authentic record of urban society.14 After Ishimoda published this article, more than thirty years passed before historians again recognized the value of Chinese fiction. Then, in his guide to the study of Chinese history in Japan published in 1983, Yamane Yukio introduced his readers to the value of colloquial stories such as "Sanyan" 『三言』，“Erpai”『二拍』，” and “〗inpingmeicihua”『金瓶梅詞話』for the study of socio-economic history.15 Soon thereafter, as part of a larger inquiry into sources relating to the history of Chinas common people (shumin 庶 民），Shiba Yoshinobu also cited colloquial stories as just such records，and gave them high praise.16 He argued that “even though the authors and the readers were intellectuals, these stories offer a clue for us to know the life of the common people.” In the years that followed，other well-known historians， including Masatoshi Tanaka,17 Kikuchi Hideo,18 and Ihara Hiroshi,19 also argued that the historical records about cities included in literature were valuable and it was possible to apply them to the study of history. Scholars of Chinese literature noticed the value of fiction to the study of history as well. For instance, OgawaYóichi, writing in 1973, emphasized their value in the fields of social and economic history, arguing, “Because colloquial stories mix [fact] with fiction，it is dangerous to consider them absolute reflec tions of reality. However，it is also not appropriate to regard them as a fairy tales totally separate from social reality. In fact, the social and economic phenomena included in [stories such as] ‘Sanyan’ and ‘Erpai’ absolutely reflect the real world. If the story does not contradict records of socio-economic history found in orthodox sources, and provided the intrinsic nature of such collections is not ignored，they can be valuable records of socio-economic phenomena."20 14.石母田正，「商人O妻」『文学』17:10(1949). 15-山根幸夫編，『中国史研究入門(下)』（山川出版社，1如5). 16.斯波義信，「中国庶民資料、:覚書」，『実学史研究m』実学資料 研究会編(思文閣出版，1986). 17.田中正俊，「文学o思想性¿歴史奁視冬眼¿」，『歴史評論』409(1984). 18.菊池英夫，『中国都市•聚落史研究乃動向¿「城郷（都鄙)関係」KlOOTíZ)私的 展望』，『中国o都市¿農村』（汲古書院、1992). 19.伊原弘，「中国史乃女加们庶民」，(大修館書店，1994年4月号〜W95 年5月号). 20.小川陽一，「姦通过々甘罪悪沙」，『集刊東洋学』29 (1973)</page><page sequence="12">140 BIBUOGRAPHY OF SONG STUDIES 丨 N JAPAN Through this discourse, the history of the Japanese middle ages, as well as that of China and Chinese literature have all come under the influence of the Annales School, the preeminent school of social history in the West. Studies in the social sciences in general and those of the Annales School in particular have mainly focused on the history of the West and have argued that focus of inquiry should be turned from the history of events ("Thistoire événementielle7) to the history of the masses (or uIyhistoire mentalite’’). Whether this can be applied to the study the history of East Asia, however, remains unclear. Put briefly, because records of Chinas common people, especially those that may have been composed by the people themselves，are so scarce， investigation of those people and their life history must always confront the shortage of historical materials. It is in this context that historians have turned to fiction, which can provide details of the life of common people. Following this lead, however, the use of colloquial stories in the study of Chinas past gradually expanded, and many studies were attempted from the 1960s to 1990s. However, most were deeply problematic, mainly because historians have commonly ignored the historical context of the stories, merely quoting those parts that contribute to their analysis without adequately under standing how to deal with fiction as an historical resource. As a result, these scholars have been sharply criticized，their attempts to use fiction stopped, and there has been no systematic attempt since to consider how best to do it. The Beginning of the Systematic Use of the Colloquial Story In 1996 the situation changed. In that year an open symposium on the theme “Chinese History Studies and the Colloquial Story — An Inquiry into the Possibilities" was held by the Society of Asian Studies of Waseda University, at which historians discussed the historical value of classical and colloquial literatures.21 In the same year, I published "On the historical value of Chinese colloquial stories and how to solve the problems.”22 This was the first article in Japanese to review what had been accomplished in the past, to analyze the shortcomings of previous studies，and to offer suggestions on improved 21. 報告，「中国史研究¿『小説』一一子O可能性仍模索一一」，『史滴』 i8 (1996) • 22.拙稿，「中国白話小説匚於技易歴史史料的価値幻援用——子•乃方法¿ 問題点们整理奁中心¿LT」，『史境』55(1996).</page><page sequence="13">BIBLIOGRAPHY methods for the utilization of colloquial stories in the future. I argued that if we are to make use of the historical references in fiction, then the biggest task we must resolve is how to distinguish the fictitious elements that have been added to in pursuit of artistry and entertainment. On the basis of nu merous previous analyses, I criticized the prior work on the grounds that it was impossible either methodologically or artistically to separate fact from fiction. Finally, I asserted that the uncritical use by historians of materials from fiction was inappropriate. On the basis of these comments, I then offered three guidelines on how best to utilize colloquial stories： 1. It is necessary to comprehend the special features and context of the story; 2. It is critical to distinguish between those details which are necessary for the structure of the story from those fictional details that are historically reliable, including recognizing whether or not the "reality" author has created is real; 3. To accomplish this, one must compare the historical references in the stories to orthodox historical records and interpretations. Sample Articles on Quoting Colloquial Stories In addition to my theoretical essay, I have published several articles utiliz ing the aforementioned methodology in order to demonstrate whether the application of historical evidence in fiction is appropriate to the study of the social history of Song and Yuan or not. These articles can be divided into two themes： studies on marriage and studies on community: The studies on marriage include： i) the reasons behind and consequences of dishonest matchmaking;23 2) divorce cases initiated by the wife；24 3) professional matchmakers and their connection to brokers；25 4) use of the marriage proposal (cczoizezz•草巾占子）by professional matchmakers;26 5) problems resulting from 23.「白話小説記事O歴史史料的有効性一一媒酌人O虚偽(7)弊害¿：原因」，早稲田 大学『史滴』iB (1997). 24.「宋元明代O文芸作品C見文石女家主導O離婚事例COOT」，中央大学『大 学院研究年報』24(1995). 25.「白話小説記事仁現tx冬媒酌人O史学的考察一一特C媒酌O専門化¿牙人¿ O関係奁中心（『中国一社会七文化』11、1996). 26.「歴史学的視点丨二上石白話小説記事O検討一一宋〜明代乙婚姻上O草 帖子〖COOT」，『中国古典小説研究』2(i996).</page><page sequence="14">142 BIBLIOGRAPHY OF SONG STUD IES IN JAPAN the expense of "betrothal money" (pincai 耳粤貝才);27 6) steps taken by officials to control the abuses of professional matchmakers.28 Those on community include： 1) urban space；29 2) women's contact with the outside world;30 3) the function of acquaintance in society.311 would like to briefly introduce three of these articles. In my essay on professional matchmakers and their connection to brokers I investigated the abuses connected with matchmaking that resulted from its professionalization. Fragmentary details about specialized matchmaking can be found in orthodox historical data. On the other hand, fiction is a rich source of information. I found an important difference between conventional matchmaking and the professionalized alternative，namely that the latter sought to introduce more than one marriage candidate. What had led to this new demand? I suggest that there were two main reasons. First, the function of the conventional marriage intermediary had been weakened in the city; second, in the city it was difficult to get to know people of the opposite sex. On basis of these conclusions，I argue that urbanization made the professional matchmaker who could introduce multiple marriage candidates necessary. I further found that in the stories I examined professional matchmakers，who were all female, were called yapo 牙婆，a term customarily applied to women engaging in small business. During the Song, the work of the commercial broker (yaren 牙人)was very similar to that of matchmakers. In the course of buying and selling female servants (nüpu 女僕 or niibi 婢女)，brokers tended to also function as matchmakers the intent was to make the servant a legal wife when her contract expired. Professional matchmakers are called yapo in the colloquial stories，I concluded，because many women engaging in small business concurrently functioned as matchmakers. In the vocabulary of the stories, yaren means the person who acts as the middleman in the business 27.「宋元代丨二杞(少石聘財^関玄石一考察一一高額聘財乃推移加6見易婚姻奁to &lt;乂社会一一」，中央大学『7夕7史研究』22(1998). 28.「官仁上冬媒酌行為COOT—一白話小説奁援用L亡『官媒』0考察」，『中国 古典小説研究』3(1998). 29.「白話小説仁現打亡近隣概念丨二"OOT—一都市仁招丨少石婚姻環境①変化奁手 掛办9¿LTJ，『宋代人O認識一一相互性¿日常空間』（汲古書院，2001). 30.「中国短篇白話小説仁見石都市生活O—考察一一宋元代及莎明代丨二於U易女 性乃外界¿(D接触仁01、了一一」，東北大学『国際文化研究科論集』8 (zoco). 31.「明代短篇白話小説丨二見无石「相識」〖二01《一一縁故機能[関玄石覚書一一」， 『中国古典小説研究』10(2005).</page><page sequence="15">BIBLIOGRAPHY OF SONG STUDIES IN JAPAN 143 of buying and selling and also acts as a broker, and it also means the small businessman. As a fixture in the neighborhood the yapo naturally knows the condition of those families in the vicinity. In addition, in the real world there are a large number of cases of a yapo engaged in small business concurrently functioning as a matchmaker. Thus, I have concluded, the term yapo came to mean "matchmaker" in the colloquial tradition. In the article on betrothal money (pincai)，I argued that the dramatic rise in the cost of betrothal money was the most negative consequence of the professionalization of the matchmaker, an interpretation that is supported by the significance of betrothal money in law and etiquette as illustrated in the colloquial literature. In seeking to explain why betrothal money became so much more expensive. I argued that in ancient times it had been a figurative gift offered to confirm an engagement. As long as the "gift" was accepted ac cording to the law and the etiquette, the marriage could be finalized. However, under Chinas system of social organization in the early first millennium CE, known as the "nine-rank system” (jiupin zhi 九品制),marriage ties were taken ever more seriously. Because the "gift" had come to be equated with the marriage itself, it came to be regarded more and more from a utilitarian viewpoint, and the mandate that the two contracting families agree on the value of the betrothal money evolved. Where the financial value of the "gift" had not been an important issue before, it began to be emphasized, leading to the vast increases in betrothal money we see during the Period of Division when marriages linked aristocrats with commoners. During the Tang and Song，a notable change occurred in patterns of exog amous marriage (such as marriage between imperial princesses [zongnii 宗 女]and the non-noble literati [shidafu 士大夫])that that led to a dramatic increase in betrothal money. In arranging marriage ties, the focus shifted from the social to economic value of a prospective partner, which we can perceive from the amount of betrothal money that was exchanged. Thus, the role of betrothal money changed from a way to control exogamy to the most important judgment of a marriage. As a result, common people (shumin 庶 民）joined the competition for getting betrothal money，matchmaking be came a profit-oriented business, and poor families were unable to marry. As the amount of money needed for marriage grew larger and larger, more and more males were forced into uxorilocal marriage (zhuixu 贅婿).In my opin ion, these changes demonstrate that among both the elite and the common</page><page sequence="16">144 BIBLIOGRAPHY people wealth had become a more critical factor than social status in making marriage connections. Finally, in my work on urban space I argued that introducing the sexes was the matchmakers most important social function, and then analyzed the change in the matchmakers role that resulted from urbanization. I found that with the spread of urban living the old patterns of familiarity and convenience that characterized matchmaking in the village gave way to professional match making in the city. I suggest this reflected the lack of opportunity to recreate the patterns of the village in the city where one rarely was acquainted with more than a handful of other families. This limited opportunity, I believe, not only reflected the patterns of urban residence but also new patterns in choosing marriage partners. Whereas in the village everyone's status was similar，in the city a range of new expectations was introduced and people no longer relied on their neighbors to help arrange unions. As a result, in keeping with the new expectations, including the evolving emphasis on wealth over status that I discussed above, in order to find the right marriage partner the matchmaker had to become professional. Because they had become so indispensable, the matchmakers ability to charge became larger and larger, which in turn caused a series of social problems such as discord between couples and the low possibility for the poor people to marry. Each of these studies demonstrates that the challenge of using fiction does not justify neglecting its value as an historical resource. Used properly, the colloquial story can make an important contribution both to the study of literature and to the study of history. Motivated by this conviction, I have distilled the historical data in the “Sanyan，”32 the first collection of Chinese colloquial stories, and catalogued the academic articles on the "Sanyan" the "Erpai" and the “Qingping shantang huaben"清平山堂話本 from Japan and China."

Okamoto Fujiaki, for example, has studied the historical materials included in this literature from the standpoint of past Chinese literature.35 Similarly, Shio Takugo, who specializes in the social history of the Song, recently has used the anecdotal literature to study the relationship between the custom of eating meat and social status, and to investigate the commodity circulation system of Suzhou 蘇州 in the Southern Song Period. Shio has also investigated the compila tion of the Taiping guangji and the historical value of the Yijian zhi. He is, in addition, compiling an as-yet unfinished index of "Xu Yijian zhi"續夷堅 志，and with Kawamura Kotaro has published a Japanese translation of the gucmg/)'"furenbu” 太平廣記「婦人」部.3Ó Other important work includes that of Ótsuka Hidetaka，who has compared the historical data in the Shuihu zhuan 7jCífFfH and DaSong xuanhe yishi 大 宋宣和遺事 with the historical facts of the period.37 Okamoto Fujiaki has examined the period when anecdotal collections were included in the Qing ping shantang huaben 清平山堂話本，38 a Ming dynasty collection of fiction, 大学大学院『論究』#巧(1993);「『三言二拍』『京本通俗小説』『清平山堂話本』関係論 文目録(中文編）」，中央大学大学院『論究』#26(1994). 34-氏岡真士，「『残唐五代演義』八乃道一一小説¿：講史」，『中国文学報』#52(1996); 「平話乃基史書」，『日本中国学会報』#49(1997);「『五代史平話』乃吻〈文一一講 史乃運命」，『中国文学報』#56 (1998)； and「南宋王O神話」，『人文科学論集』#34 (2000). 35.岡本不二明『唐宋O小説¿社會』.汲古書院(zoo。• 36.塩卓悟，「宋代二招技冬肉食O普及状況一一南宋期•江南①事例奁中心丨二」， 『集刊東洋学』#79 (!998)；「宋代牛肉食考」，『中国一社会¿文化』(2001);「南宋代 t二如化蘇州O経済的性格¿商品流通構造」，『千里山文学論集』#59(19於)；「宋太宗 O文化事業一一『太平広記』奁中心丨：」，『比較文化史研究』#5(2oo3);「歴史史料 O『夷堅志』一子O虚構¿史実」，『中国筆記小説研究』#6(2002);「『続夷堅志』索引」， 『千里山文学論集』#66 (2001);塩卓悟•河村晃太郎，『譯注太平廣記婦人部』（汲古書 院，2004);and竺沙雅章，『独裁君主O登場宋O太祖¿太宗』（清水書院，叫74). 57.大塚秀高，「瘟神乃物語一宋江O字过々甘公明々O加」，『宋代(D規範¿習俗』(汲 古書院，1995);「宋代社会¿：物語」，『東洋文化研究所紀要』#129 (1996); and「天書¿泰 山一一『宣和遺事』上9各石『水滸伝』成立O謎」，『東洋文化研究所紀要』#140(2000). 38.岡本不二明，「宋代話本「陳巡検梅嶺失妻記」O再検討」，『宋代O規範¿習俗』</page><page sequence="18">146 BIBLIOGRAPHY OF SONG STUDIES IN JAPAN and investigated the economic life of the Song as it is reflected in the genre called “random notes” (biji 筆記)and anecdotal collections. Furthermore, this literature has been applied to the study of Tang history by Seo Tatsuhiko39 as well as by Takeda Akira40 and Takanishi Narisuke.41 We can certainly conclude that scholars have made progress after their many earlier failures. However，we must recognize that other important problems remain unsolved. For example, there is an important problem about the concept of xiaoshuo in China. Scholars have been uncritically using both suibi 隨筆 and biji 筆記，both of which are the product of the educated elite (shidafu)’ without clearly recognizing their distinctions. Besides，what is meant by xiaoshuo changed during the Song，so it is necessary to clarify the meaning as soon as possible. Other Trends Next I would like to introduce two projects that have had a significant impact on the conventional concept of fiction： my own study on huaben 話本；and Zaimokuya Atsushis investigation on the accessibility of colloquial stories. Huaben, I have argued, is the most important term in the study of the col loquial story, but there have been many interpretations of what it means.42 Most prominently, the term has meant： 1. a sourcebook for professional storytellers (shuohua ren 說話人）used in en tertainment halls (goulan 勾欄)43; 2. the record of the presentation by a professional storyteller44； (汲古書院，1995)； and「筆記小説办6办亡宋代士人O金銭感覚¿経済状態」，『7夕7 遊学』#l8 (2000). 59.妹尾達彦，「唐代後半期乃長安¿伝奇小説一『李娃伝』乃分析奁中心¿LT」，『論 集中国社会.制度•文化史乃諸問題』（日野開三郎博士頌寿記念論集刊行会編，1987); and「唐代長安0店舗立地¿街西O致富譚」，『布目潮颯博士古稀記念論集東7夕7 乃法¿社会』(汲古書院，199o). 40.竹田晃，「唐代伝奇丨：：招《“各金銭感覚」，『日本中国学会創立五十年記念論文 集』（汲古書院，1998). 41.高西成介「唐代小説仁見6打冬致富譚丨二01、了」，『中國中世文學研究』#45,46 (20。4). 42.「白話小説研究仁招W•苍「話本」O定義COOT——中国白話小説研究丨：：招过 易一展望（III)一一」，『国際文化研究科論集』#7(1999). 43-近藤春雄，『中国学芸大事典』（大修館書店，1978). 44.藤堂明保•伊藤漱平，「近世小説O文学•言語¿：号O時代」，in大阪市立大学中 国文学研究室，『中国O八大小説』（平凡社，105).</page><page sequence="19">BIBLIOGRAPHY OF SONG STUDIES IN JAPAN 147 3. a synonym for xiaoshuo and huawen 話文，and also an abstract word meaning “story”45 Although these definitions complement each other，they are not fully equivalent. For instance, if we think that huaben means the sourcebook used in a presentation and also the record of a presentation, then it is easy to conclude that a sourcebook and presentation are the same thing. However, the former is used by the storyteller before telling the story, while the latter is a record made after listening to the story. Thus they lie on opposite sides of the act of storytelling. Furthermore, according to the third definition, "story" is not something concrete but metaphysical, and it doesn't wholly accord with the first two definitions which both have substance，either as the notes for the presentation or as the text that has been presented. Consequently, the Chügoku shósetsu shóji ten (Encyclopedia of small matters in Chinese fiction) defines the term as follows. 4. Originally it meant "story" (monogatari 物語)，but now it means “sourcebook，’ (daihon 台本）or the "record of a lecture” (hitsuroku 筆録)of the oral pre sentation of a written work (kóshó bungaku 講口昌文学).* Notably this last definition contains three concepts that are mutually inconsis tent yet exist together under the definition of huaben. It is obvious, therefore, that the definition has not yet been standardized. If it remains so, scholars will continue to arbitrarily select the one they prefer，thus perpetuating the confusion. There are other problems as well. For example, the field of Chinese fiction has become increasingly active since the 1990s, especially as more and more studies are being published by Chinese scholars. Most Chinese scholarship has focused on Lu Xuns Survey of Chinese Fiction.^7 These scholars have stuck to the first definition, neglecting refinements such as the third. In my opinion， if the term continues to be so randomly used, the study of the colloquial story will remain confused, leading to a more serious problem in future. Therefore, as the final piece of my essay I would like to analyze the dominant theories relating to huaben，and to try to establish what the correct definition of the term should be. 45.増田渉，「「話本」—通説(务&amp;、过定説)"O疑問_」，大阪 市立大学『人文研究』#i6:5 (1965) • 46.内山知也•佐藤一郎等編，『中国小説小事典』（高文堂出版社，1990). 47.魯迅，『中国小説史略』（北京•新潮社，1923-H).</page><page sequence="20">148 BIBLIOGRAPHYOFSONGSTUDIESINJAPAN Generally speaking, the understanding of what huaben means has gone through three stages： 1. To Lu Xun, writing in 1923, huaben meant “sourcebook ” 2. Yoshikawa Kojiro and Iriya Yoshitaka, writing in 1940, agreed with Lu Xun but in addition considered huaben to be a record of oral narration and the existing text itself as well.48 3. Masuda Wataru, writing in 1965, regarded huaben as both "an historical fact and a story."49 Two points are worthy of note. First，Lu Xuns interpretation was not his own but a reflection of current understanding at the time he wrote. Second，it has become clear through subsequent scholarship that Masudas interpretation is correct： the meaning of huaben is not limited to “story.” The value of his interpretation, however，has not been recognized. On the contrary, because of the respect accorded to Lu Xun and the tendency in the study of literature to rely heavily on the work of others，Lu Xuns interpretation has continued to be widely followed. Turning to the work of Zaimokuya Atsushi, in an article published in 2001 he surveyed the ease with which children read colloquial literature.50 He was interested in the claim found in the preface of Jingshi tongyan 警世通言， a collection of huaben stories compiled in the early Qing，that children can learn morality from reading “popular fiction” (tongsu xiaoshuo 通俗,J、說). He selected a group of children with different levels of elementary education： some had read the standard textbooks of elementary education，including the Sanzijing 三字經，the Baijiaxing 百家姓，and Qianziwen 千字文；others had studied more advanced texts, including the Qianjiashi 千家詩 and the Sanbai qianqian 三百千千. Zaimokuya first assessed what level of education is necessary for children to understand the Analects and the Exemplary Biographies of Twenty-four Filial Sons (Ershisi xiao 二十四孝)• His results were as follows： 48.入矢義高，『洛陽三怪記』（弘文堂書房，1948). 49.増田渉「「話本」¿1、，二¿丨二通説（务別、过定説）八O疑問一」. 50.材木谷敦，「子供¿文字¿小説¿——『警世通言』序丨：：糾少易「通俗性」全feCo TJ,『中央大学文学部紀要』#64(2000.</page><page sequence="21">149 b OF TOTAL NUMBER OF WORDS UNDERSTOOD 69.6 81.3 95.1 58.4 64.4 88.6 b OF TOTAL NUMBER OF WORDS UNDERSTOOD EDUCATION % OF TYPES OF LEVEL WORDS UNDERSTOOD Sanzijing 35.7 Qianziwen 54.4 Sanbai qianqian 83.9 B1BUOGRAPHY OF SONG STUDIES CLASSIC EDUCATION LEVEL Lunyu Sanzijing Qianziwen Sanbai qianqian Ershisi xiao Sanzijing Qianziwen Sanbai qianqian On this basis he determined that those children who had only read the San zijing and the Qianzijing could not fully understand these texts, that it was necessary in fact to have progressed at least to the Sanbai qianqian. Further more, when presented with the “Dushiniang nuchen baibao xiang” 杜十娘 怒沈百寶箱 from the stories in the Jingshi tongyan, even those children who had read the Sanbai qianqian had difficulty： EDUCATION LEVEL Sanzijing Qianziwen Sanbai qianqian % OF TYPI WORDS UNDE1 24.6 4I.O 74-7 ES OF ERSTOO 6 OF TOTAL NUMBER OF WORDS UNDERSTOOD 50.7 62.5 89.5 Zaimokuya concluded that children who have only had an elementary educa tion cannot fully understand the colloquial literature. There are problems with Zaimokuyas work. For example, the Sanzijing and Qianziwen have long been used to teach classical Chinese (wenyan 文 言)but not for teaching colloquial Chinese (baihua 白話).Although it has been possible to learn the latter through daily conversation, there are no textbooks of the colloquial language that parallel the Sanzijing and Qianzi He concluded that there is no barrier for children who have received an elementary education that included the Qianziwen and Sanbai qianqian to read these texts. He then assessed the children's ability to comprehend two examples of colloquial literature, the Sanguozhi tongsu yanyi 三國志通俗演 義 and the Guanyun changgua gu liaodu 關雲長刮骨療毒，both of which are cited in the preface of Jingshi tongyan as examples of literature that children should be able to comprehend： OFiTO sR£ 9EEn r 4 09 2.24 Nt6 o IÁ9-9 u 3 58 3 4 7 440 9-r^o. 4 6 9</page><page sequence="22">150 wen; textbooks of the classical language should not be used as a foundation for understanding colloquial texts. I also believe his sample is too small and that his assessing the ability to read based on the percentage of characters the student recognizes is problematic. Despite these shortcomings, however, I believe that it is possible for Zaimukuya to improve his analysis in the future， and that then the importance of equating “colloquial” and “popular” will be recognized. Conclusion The study of Chinese fiction does not have a long history, having only begun with the publication of Lu Xuns Survey of Chinese Fiction eighty years ago. Heretofore scholars in Japan have devoted their energies primarily to examin ing the origins of the colloquial story and the history of collections. Though there are still many problems to be solved, I am confident that we are reaching a clearer understanding of Chinese colloquial literature. Too often scholars have randomly used stories without understanding their real nature. It is neces sary to understand the nature of fiction and to use it appropriately. Nevertheless fiction, as the subject of an interdisciplinary to history is a promising field and we can anticipated that its future accomplishments will be important. A big treasure box has been opened through this line of inquiry, but still there are many doors left closed which we can hope will soon be opened.
