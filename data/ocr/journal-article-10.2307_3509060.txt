<plain_text><page sequence="1">Names For Children ROBIN PURVES Glasgow In his essay, Le Peintre de la vie moderne, Baudelaire makes a general statement about the quality or qualities peculiar to the nature of superlative creators: 'Le genie n'est que l'enfance retrouvee a volonte, l'enfance douee mainten- ant, pour s'exprimer, d'organes virils et de l'esprit analytique qui lui permet d'ordonner la somme de materiaux involontairement amassee.'" 'L'enfance retrouvee a volonte': childhood rediscovered at will, but also, it seems, under the aegis of the will, the sovereign and inevitably adult principle of order. The exercise of one's genius, then, involves a retrospective and methodical appropriation of the childish state, to be coupled with and tempered by a necessary maturity, producing 'un homme-enfant [.. .] un homme possedant a chaque minute le genie de l'enfance, c'est-a-dire un genie pour lequel aucun aspect de la vie n'est emoussee'. A more particular proposition is made, in the service of the new kind of draughtsmanship Baudelaire is keen to promote in parts of the essay, when a tendency in visual artists to abstraction and the erasure of detail in the service of l'ensemble is alleged to be 'le resultat d'une perception enfantine'. Baudelaire's new draughts- manship, it seems, is to be an art with a measure of artlessness: its childishness is elsewhere in the article connected with an appropriate barbarousness, which overlaps with the enfantine theme in a way that could be described as Rousseauesque, as the growth of the child into the man is the analogue for the evolution of man from the 'savage' state into civilization. The child and the 'savage' are both aboriginal, it is said, and their original innocence is not yet made corrupt by contact with the decrepitude and extravagance, the exhausting surfeit of fripperies that characterize civilization. Baudelaire clearly utilizes so-called primitive art, and so-called childish qualities, as examples, for the desired suppression of inessential minutiae in paintings, examples that represent an honesty, simplicity, and directness that precede the imposition of a received and decadent culture. At or near the beginning of the twentieth century, this sort of strategy will have become a straightfor- ward and outspoken promotion and collection of children's art, by artists such as Kandinsky and Klee who argued for 'pure elementary representa- tion'2 and against faithful reproduction, citing the supposed ability of young children to perceive with new eyes and thus to represent some ideal, general Charles Baudelaire, 'Le Peintre de la vie moderne', in (Euvres completes, ed. by Claude Pichois, 2 vols (Paris: Gallimard, 1976), II, 690. 2 Paul Klee, On Moder Art, trans. by Paul Findlay (London: Faber, 1966), p. 53.</page><page sequence="2">Names For Children form of an object without being distracted by irrelevant idiosyncracies or by received models, though the stylistic conventions that seem to produce a certain uniformity in child art, the uniformity prized by its promoters as true and essential, might just as easily be viewed as utterly cultural, derivative. The recourse to the figure of 'the child' as artistic exemplar is, of course, commonplace, a staple of any polemic that claims to be witnessing or willing the final collapse of a derelict order and the simultaneous birth of the new, and it can be shown to be just as persistent in milder and more reticent discourses. At or near the infancy of his poetic career, the work of the Scottish poet, W. S. Graham, owes an obvious and considerable debt to an English translation of the Illuminations, a set of prose-poems by Arthur Rimbaud. As is well known, Rimbaud's most productive spell as a poet took place between the ages of fourteen and nineteen, at which point he seems entirely to have given up any serious literary ambitions, and this startling biography has incited a host of artists, from virtually every discipline, to invoke him as the very principle of unmanageable adolescent revolt. From DADA and the Surrealists, to the novelist, William Burroughs, rock musicians such as Bob Dylan and Patti Smith, and the visual artist, Terry Atkinson, who secretly invented a persona that he named Rimbaud-Me when in revolt against his fellow members of the conceptual art grouping Art &amp; Language, Rimbaud's posthumous career amounts to a long series of appropriations prompted by the iconicity of an 'homme-enfant' whose literary radicality is all too easily reduced to a generalized, unprincipled delinquency. The nature of W. S. Graham's debt to Rimbaud in his first published collection, Cage Without Grievance, gives his inspiration a different inflection. Although the influence is principally, but not exclusively, from the poems-in-prose, what Graham appears to borrow is a lexicon and a particular kind of clause or sentence, which he goes on to arrange in lines and stanzas that sometimes declare the parallel influence of Old English verse-forms, and sometimes form perfectly regular iambic pentameters: Webs nourished no alarm. At green partitions the serene infusion of our eyes Discovered resorts crossbeamed for journeymen. [.. .] Cockles submerged their flower-exploding cells And climbed my weedy wall.

('Let Me Measure My Prayer with Sleep')4 One English rendering of the Illuminations contains the following sentences which are reminiscent of terms, structures, and atmospheres in the quotations from Graham.5 From After the Flood' (p. 233): 'As soon as the idea of the Flood had subsided, a hare stopped among the clover and the swaying flower bells, and said his prayer to the rainbow through the spider's web.' 'Beavers built. Coffee-cups steamed in the little bars.' And from 'Childhood (I)' (pp. 235-36): At the edge of the forest - dream flowers tinkle, flash, flare -the girl with orange lips, her knees crossed in the clear flood surging from the meadows, nakedness shaded, crossed, clothed by rainbows, flora, the sea.' And, finally, from 'Mystique' (p. 267): 'On the slope of the bank, angels swirl their robes of wool in pastures of steel and emerald.' The vocabulary in Graham's poems evokes a setting where deliriously animated pastoral elements can encroach upon comically vulnerable human constructions. The type of clause or sentence most often borrowed has a deceptively simple Subject- Verb - Object structure, the most basic form for description of a scene by an observer, in which either There Is Something, or Someone/Something Does or Did Something to Something or Someone Else. The form is deployed repeatedly, within one work and across the volume as a whole and the ur-text for this deployment is from the third section of Rimbaud's 'Enfance/Childhood': Au bois il y a un oiseau, son chant vous arrete et vous fait rougir. I1 y a une horloge qui ne sonne pas. II y a une fondriere avec un nid de b&amp;tes blanches. I1 y a une cathedrale qui descend et un lac qui monte. II y a une petite voiture abandonnee dans le taillis, ou qui descend le sentier en courant, enrubannee. I1 y a une troupe de petits com6diens en costumes, apercus sur la route a travers la lisiere du bois. II y a enfin, quand l'on a faim et soif, quelqu'un qui vous chasse. ('Enfance (III)')6 The gradually increasing complexity of the sentences in 'Enfance (III)', considered with the anaphoric use of the 'I1 y a' introduction, is reminiscent of the kinds of sentences provided as examples in pedagogically-inclined literature for infants, books designed to encourage and accelerate the acquisition of a native language. It is not difficult to imagine each sentence at the foot of its own page, with a large illustration above it (even if the 4 Cage IIthout Grievance, p. 2 I.

The sentences also share similarities with examples in manuals for people (children or adults) at an early stage in learning a new language (even if these sentences might be a little less practical than the usual array, which seem principally concerned with eliciting directions to train stations). But a book written for infants, or a primer for beginning language students, is written with a very different kind of attention in mind than a book of poetry written for adults. A child being taught the rules of rudimentary language use would be expected to map each isolate word with a familiar and isolate concept or thing and thus apprehend, on some level, grammatical conventions, the base rules for new combinations of new words; and the beginning student of a second or third language would be expected to map each new word with a familiar word or words in his or her native language and, again, grasp any idiosyncracies in word order, but the adult reader of the poetic text expects to undertake an examination of different series of conceptual meanings, the denotations and connotations of each word alone and in its context(s). The quotation from Graham's 'Let Me Measure My Prayer With Sleep' continues a dispiritingly twee case in favour of poetry and dream and against the grasping reality of the rent collector, with 'Leave me for child's sake hubbed in harebells' and that odd word, hubbed, which seems to be Graham's own coinage, suggests an image of the speaker as a child at the 'hub' of a perhaps circular swathe of flowers. The harebells are known by the name of 'bluebells' in Graham's native Scotland but bluebells lack the required alliterative h and do not conflate the 'hare' and the 'flower bells' from the English translation of Rimbaud's 'Apres le Deluge'. Hubbed also calls to mind both 'huddled' (as if the word was mispronounced by an infant mouth, or misspelled by a childish hand) and, maybe, 'hid' or 'hidden', which connotes the state of being wrapped or concealed in a natural and comforting swaddling. Cage Without Grievance was not the first book that Graham wrote but it is the first book that he published.7 The appropriation of the vocabulary from some of Rimbaud's most picturesque, dewy books of genesis (though these are never as ingenuously untrammelled as Graham's citations would seem to make them), along with his naively rendered anthropomorphism; the echoes of rhythmic and alliterative patterns from the earliest available texts in the British poetic canon; the virtually unclouded verve of the profuse, primary 7 The first book to he written was The Seven Journeys (Glasgow: MacLellan. 1944), which was eventually published two years after Cage Without Grievance. It too shows the influence of Rimbaud, but the Rimbaud of'Le Bateau Ivre', a poem which bitterly recollects arduous experience and stands il stark contrast to the elements that Graham went on to borrow from the Illuminations. To complicate matters further. Graham's third book of poetry, published in 1945, was named 2ND Poems. 232</page><page sequence="5">ROBIN PURVES narcissism with which the poems are imbued,8 all suggest that the book was written as a first book, to be and to read like a first book, a halcyon debut and introduction, freshly-minted, exhibiting an achieved innocence and promising an infinity of indefinite potential, the infinite promise of the new- born. A rather tangential form of support for this view arrives from an unexpected and unlikely quarter. One of the few references to the poetry of Rimbaud in the published work of Martin Heidegger is a swift and gnomic citation of this same third section of'Enfance', delivered in the 'Summary of a Seminar on the Lecture "Time and Being" '.9 The job of the summary is to explain and expand upon some of the more resistant passages of the original lecture, delivered in 1962, which was a late revision of some unsatisfactory formulations in Heidegger's major work, Being and Time. Heidegger's central project, the philosophical reaffirmation of the forgot- ten difference between Being and beings in a fundamental ontology that is absolutely prior to the derived metaphysical tradition, is more or less intact. The seminar, however, spends some time on the lecture's restatement of the correct expression of Being's identity: there is, apparently, a serious error contained in the form of the phrase 'Being is' because Being 'is not a thing', is not 'like an actual being in time'. This error can be evaded, though, by what Heidegger refers to as a 'change in idiom': the restatement has the form &gt;&gt;es gibte das Sein, literally, 'it gives Being', but meaning, in idiomatic German, 'there is Being'. The effect of the consequent undermining of stable subject and object categories that appears to take place when Heidegger revises Being-as-subject to Being-as-object of the sentence is curiously similar to aspects of Rimbaud's notorious formulation: 'JE est un autre.'t0 Being is not simply the subject of the third-person singular present form of the verb 'to be' or indeed simply its object: there is Being and it gives Being: it seems able to occupy both positions. It is worth stressing therefore that the phrase 'JE est un autre', from Rimbaud's lettre du voyant, both states and vacates the position of the subjective pronoun as it refers to the speaker or writer: states a relation to the mind of the thinking, stating subject, but also displaces the pronoun from that subjective position, rewriting the first person pronoun as an objective pronoun, directing the cognition of the stating, stated subject away from that subjective position and towards the subject as an object that I In 1943, a friend of Graham, the poet Edwin Morgan, who was taking part in the war in North Africa at the time, wrote a letter to Graham attacking Cage TI itl/out Grievance in outspoken terms. Morgan described the poems as 'unreal, without meaning, severed from true and naked emotion and shy of true thought', seemingly angered by their hlissful ignorance of the most obvious, horrifying, and pressingly momentous events of the dav (see The \ighl/fisherma.n: Selected Letters of 1 S. Graha/m, ed. by Mlichael and n\Iargaret Snow (Nlanchlester: Carcanet, 999)). The attack did little or nothing to discomfit Graham or alter his own opinions about the value of the book and, despite regular negative criticism of his earliest works from fi-iends and critics alike, he remained disarmingly loyal to and enthusiastic about them up until the end of his life.

In this way, the formula can be said to fulfil the requirements for straightforward self-reference, the reference by the author or by the first person pronoun back to his or her own objectified conscious experience, and to elude that same reading practice, by insisting that the 'I' who refers is no less of an object, is not simply and straightforwardly a subject who refers. The profound difference that separates Rimbaud from Heidegger even as it evokes this superficial resemblance between them can be expressed in the following way: Rim- baud's formulation insists upon a gulf of non-identity that can only subvert the authority of consciousness as presence, while Heidegger's thought tends towards an absolute identity communicated in what looks like the homely pieties of tautology: 'Yet being - what is being? It "is" It itself. [Doch das Sein - was ist das Sein? Es ist Es selbst.]"' In the 'Summary of a Seminar on "Time and Being"' Heidegger goes on to quote two poems by Trakl which use the form es gibt anaphorically, and then quotes their assumed model, the work by Rimbaud, whose repeated Ily a is said to be the closest French equivalent of es gibt. These examples are referred to only minimally; they are meant to display just how the es gibt can be experienced and seen, and they hardly require further comment, because their display is considered to be beautifully self-evident. In the giving of es gibt and Ily a, as evidenced by the poems, Heidegger sees that there is already the potential for the necessary requisition by man of what is given: If we say, for example, there are trouts in the brook, the mere 'Being' of trouts is not being confirmed. Before that, and at the same time, a distinction of the brook is expressed in this sentence. The brook is characterized as a trout brook, thus as a special brook, one in which we can go fishing. In the simple use of 'It gives,' 'there is,' there already lies the relation to man. (p. 38) The same could be said for the light, the jug, the vineyard and the room in the first stanza of the first poem by Trakl that Heidegger citesl2 (though the final sentence of 'Enfance (III)': 'II y a enfin, quand l'on a faim et soif, quelqu'un qui vous chasse', might be said to accommodate an experience of the laws governing private property and trespass which disturbs what Derrida has called 'the tranquil self-evidence of the "there is" '13 and so spoils Heidegger's austere Arcadia, tidily strewn with goods organic or unadornedly man-made). It is this opportunity for human arrogation that results in the accommodating simplicity of the sentence-forms: the 'is' of Martin Heidegger, 'Letter On Humanism', in Pathmarks, ed. by WNilliam McNeill (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, I998), p. 252. 12 The translation into English of the seminar gives the first stanza of Trakl's poem 'Psalm' only in its English rendering: It is a light which the wind has extinguished. It is a jug which a drunkard leaves in the afternoon. It is a vineyard, burned and black with holes full of spiders. It is a room which they haxe whitewashed. 13 Jacques Derrida, The Post Card, trans. by Alan Bass (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, I987), P. 35. 234</page><page sequence="7">ROBIN PURVES 235 Trakl and Rimbaud is said to be richer and simpler and clearer than the 'is' that merely states an existence because Appropriation [Ereignis]' is said to be closer to Being than the existence of 'mere things, of mere occurrence'. Appropriation is prior to any thing that can be appropriated, any give and/ or take of relation. As Heidegger makes his own very selective deployment of 'Enfance', so does Graham. A mutual concern to establish The First, as an unconcealed and indisputable value, a kind of latency about to unravel into the metaphysical complexity of a career, in Graham's case, and of History in Heidegger's, connects Graham with Heidegger by analogy at his askew 'originary' moment, a connection that will not become openly thematic until Graham's last book, Implements in Their Places.14 The rest of this essay will turn to one poem and some prose by J. H. Prynne in order to examine the imbrication of a number of differently recursive tendencies and highlight the co-implication, inside and across these tendencies, of certain themes emerging from the foregoing introduction: the child, the parent(s), property, and origin. Prynne's only published and extended discussion of literature written for children is in Stars, Tigers and the Shape of Words, the text of his two William Matthews Lectures delivered at Birkbeck College, London, in I992. The main business of these discourses is to examine and evaluate Saussure's description of the arbitrariness of the sign in order to investigate 'the complex implications of this technical concept for the understanding and interpretation of poetic language'.'5 After a precise introduction to the nature of these implications (basically, that the methodology of practical literary criticism habitually contradicts Saussure's theory of language by assuming that acoustic or graphic properties of the sign do contribute to the apprehension of meanings), Prynne first tests Saussure's theory inside an extraordinary two-stage reading of 'The Star', a verse from an anonymous I 8o6 volume entitled Rhymesfor the Nursery. This choice of text is motivated by the presence, in verse written for young children, of the repetition of sound-effects, which is said to provide an early rehearsal for the mature apprehension of semantic effects. This means, among other things, that there is a likeness between the active and alert child at play, and the no less active and alert adult reader of an adult text although it is explained that there is a considerable difference in their respective qualities of attention. The adult, according to Prynne, enjoys the ability to imagine or reckon the set of effects that are specifically designed for children (by an assumed adult author): these effects are said to be acoustic and/or rhythmic, with a discernible and minimal (because reduced) semantic content. And the adult, given that reduction, can also choose to reconstruct what would have been 14 W. S. Graham, Implements in Their Places (London: Faber, I977). 15 Stars, Tigers and the Shape of liords (London: Birkbeck College, 993), p. .</page><page sequence="8">Names For Children an adult-orientated cultural-historical matrix inside the text (as reference, allusion) and outside of it (availablefor reference, allusion). This description of the more extensive scope of a historically-aware, temporalized adult consciousness assumes a corresponding unhistorical presentness of the infant mind which is able only to apprehend the association of like sounds in their sequence: not so much unhistorical, perhaps, as minimally historical, taken up with a personal history measured in seconds (the time it takes to traverse the spaces between words in a sentence or stanza) and not years or centuries. Nursery rhymes, then, are in this argument the means by which early consciousnesses are exercised; it is the poem's 'persistent collocation' of words and forms which 'implants and reinforces semantic intuition by constructing these ordered patterns of sound' (p. o). And this acoustic recognition of regularity is barely an act of cognition, being a first step in training towards an independent, developed cognitive functioning which in turn enables the perception and interpretation of the panoply of textual details that can and do signify. The star, then, in the poem, 'The Star', is, to the child (according to Prynne's argument), the star: just this star, the star which is mentioned, is simply named. It is simple, the star, because it has been denuded of an intrusive and complicating history, history being exactly that which complicates. The child is relatively simple too, being a kind of tabula rasa which has yet to be stained by the acquisition of that enabling but complicating and dreadful historical knowledge: it is both unimpeded by history and impeded by its lack of history. When history is restored to 'The Star' by Prynne's adult reconstruction, the star is the Star, the celestial body said to have appeared in the sky above Bethlehem to mark the birth of Christ. What is most interesting, for the purposes of this essay, is the sequence of events: the child is father/mother to the man/woman in the sense that it is obviously chronologically prior to its own matured state, but insofar as the production of a verse for children is concerned, Prynne is clear: the parent-text is parent to the child-text, being an implied, prior form which was then subject to reduction, the elision or suppression of symbolic meanings that are actively cultivated in the literary text written for an adult audience. This priority of the parent-text stands, despite its reconstruction's dependence upon its prior child-text. The paring-away of 'ideas' to leave the material substrate of prominent phonetic, graphic, and rhythmic features requires that the child-reader is seen to use words like objects, and the adult-reader to use words as names (i.e. names for their hypothetical, complete set of significations). Prynne claims to demonstrate, however, that the sound and the shape of letters and word-forms in literary compositions can be shown justly to contravene Saussure's arbitrariness hypothesis. The features left for the child can be read as motivated, not arbitrary; they are usefully meaningful: they contribute to the sense that we can apprehend on reading the work, even if 236</page><page sequence="9">ROBIN PURVES Prynne has serious doubts about the likelihood that a child could compre- hend their contribution. The evident motivation in literature's special case is made evident in Prynne's text by this postulated gap in reading abilities between historicizing adults and their unhistorical children: the division of 'the reading and interpreting community into generational strata' discloses the 'essentially retrospective' nature of literary motivation: The distinctively literary nature of the literary text marks it for reading with a heightened sense of the accumulated layers and aspects of association which form the significatory resonance of previous usage: the whole prior history of the language-community can be tuned to allow and invite the vibrations of sense and suggestion and historical retrospect. It is not the lexicon which carries these data, so much as the encyclopedia and the historical thesaurus and some ideally synoptic dictionary of quotations: to the functions of language as code and framework have been added those of dep6t-inventory and memory-theatre. (p. I8) Retrospection in earlier works by Prynne, especially those that clearly display the influence of Heidegger, such as A Pedantic Note in Two Parts16 and his i97i lecture on Charles Olson's Maximus iv, v, and vI,17 correspond closely to the conventional model common to Baudelaire, Rousseau, Klee, and the rest, where a rediscovery of a prior simplicity is derived from an admittedly adult perspective but the priority of the childish state is never problematized by the necessary postulation of an even more prior set of parents, who once were children and, no doubt, had parents of their own, who once ... and so on. A Pedantic Note in Two Parts appeared in I967, in a mimeographed magazine, with a tiny circulation, called The English Intelligencer. It consists of photocopied extracts from a number of publications with hand-written marginalia by Prynne and the first Part begins with a commentary upon the entry for the Old English word wynn in a publication Prynne renames 'the new Oxford Dictionary of Etymological Evasion &amp; Cowardice'. The entry is condemned for its rather vague and hesitant lexicography, which fails to deliver an adequate etymology, never mind a useful philological analysis. Its failure is thus said to be equivalent to the 'suppression' of the 'specific rune of our only tolerable condition' -sanctioning the relegation of wynn to 'winsome', a poeticism or soppy literary-romantic token, and this incompet- ence and complacency is representative of 'our modern permafrost, of the spirit' (p. 346). We are estranged from our congenital signs and the Oxford Etymological Dictionary 'will do nothing to take us back, to the sounds of our proper selves' (p. 348). This original propriety has its single people in their extensive but singularized place: 'The English rune wynn [ . .] was the name for "bliss"; it was a proper name, reaching right across Germania and back before the division of the Indo-European peoples. It is the same root as the Latin Venus (which is also a proper name)' (p. 346). Then there is a fall 16 'A Pedantic Note in Two Parts', The English Intelligencer, 2nd series (Summer i967), 346-51. 17 'On Maximus iv, v &amp; vi', Serious Iron [Iron, I2] (c. 197 I), not paginated. 237</page><page sequence="10">Names For Children into exilic multiplicity, the division as physical scattering of the Indo- Europeans and, perhaps, a concomitant division from their proper state of being. The quasi-Heideggerian recursion to Indo-European, inside a lin- guistic-philosophical-poetic duty to re-collect and re-new, avoids any recognizably Heideggerian linguistic chauvinism that, for example, might deplore the event of the Norman invasion for supplanting the Old English bliss of some feudal idyll with the appropriating imposition of the conquerors' Old Frenchjoie et plesir. The conclusion to an early poem, 'The Wound, Day and Night', from The White Stones,'8 contains an unidentified quotation 'And in variety of aspects the sum remains the same, one family'- that it be too much with us, again as beyond that enfeebled history: that we be born at long last into the image of love which, I wager, refers to the Indo-European family of languages (with Indo- European as the hypothetical parent) and proceeds to the asking, from the perspective of a longing descendant, for a birth which is a rebirth into a lost and ideal concord of linguistic forms. What's in a name, the name for bliss? The requisition of the noun as name answers a demand for intelligibility, both of the word and of the thing that it is said to name by direct indication. The word and the thing are joined in the name, each to each, by kinship, a meaningful consanguinity. Tracing of the prolific, derived branches of the semantic family tree back to its primary roots will therefore be seen to involve a down-grading or side-lining of the status of metaphor in favour of the noun-as-name (presuming that such a distinction can easily be made); this operation is staged in the second Part of the Pedantic JVote, which is written a year and a day after the first and is prompted by a 'complication' which has since come to light: 'the sense of winn, wynne used in place-names of Anglo-Saxon origin to mean "meadow", "pasture", recorded as an unusual but quite distinct form' (p. 349). The complication is further complicated by a 'sense-linkage' to the denotation for 'places in dispute [ . .] or the scene of a fight'.'9 By reference to early usages recorded in two German etymological dictionaries, Prynne suggests that the first complication can be explained by a subsequent dispersal of the 'concentration of sense achieved by the runic sign' which informs a later but still 'very early Germanic sense of contentment or pleasure induced by successful effort' and this in turn provides the possibility of a reassuring explanation for the initially alarming appearance of the relation between the meadow and the meaning 'site of battle': 'the 18J.

This semantic extension would appear to be happily intra-linguistic, that is, there is no need for the proper name wynn (which is, before and after all, the name of our only tolerable condition) to commemor- ate the shedding of real blood: its purity, uniqueness, and propriety, dimly recalled, are, in the worst case, only the current markers of a current regret and a fecund dissatisfaction. The rest of the Pedantic Note is taken up with a 'different resolution of these differences' involving another 'displacement into the specific locus of longing and the power of love fulfilled by the attainment of happiness': The idea is of course paradise, in the composite sense of'garden of bliss', 'field of the (immortal) happy ones', 'the elysian fields'. Paradise itself, via its Persian origins, signifies a closed garden, which in later Christian use accords well with the walled garden as secluded metonym for the blessed fields. But the Anglo-Saxon compound words suggest open meadow or pasture-land, even champaign, as the land of the blessed. (p. 350) And this development is the preparation for the JNote's consummate moment, the final page, where it is announced: The runic wynn is thus the fulfilled sign ofjoy, separation from which is the exile or distance of hope, desire, love; all the projective excursions of motive which converge in longing and (so they say) arrive ultimately in the beautiful recourse of the blessed. (p. 35') The fulfilment has depended upon the protraction and expansiveness of the field compared to the garden, because it includes the whole range of love, desire, the pursuit of happiness; it is the nomadic or excursive condition of longing fulfilled and completed. The connection suggested here between 'to long for, longing' and 'long, extended in length (of space or time)' is not accidental; it sets out the spatial &amp; historic metaphor, in 'desire' separated by exile from 'fulfilment', as a literal component of the land; the ground of being and the dimension of spiritual travel. (p. 350) The argument involves the push down and back, past what is assumed to be an abstract, contingent, and derived metaphor to the satisfyingly substantive 'literal' from which it was derived, and the fulfilment of its name. This exquisite synthesis of world and word, sound and self, in their final origin, is the result, it seems, of a strange, recursive-redemptive work that longs to heal the wound and invigorate an 'enfeebled history' by contracting: at this point, Prynne seems to share, in some ways if not in others, the projective project of Charles Olson, whose Maximus poem, he says, 'is growing back into itself and its historic matrix, not outwards and upwards from it'.20 Just as Heidegger's fundamental ontology can be said to rewrite 'the "is" of 20 J.

The concluding section of this essay will examine a poem by Prynne, again from the collection The White Stones, a poem which 'takes place' inside a garden and which affords an encounter with another retrospective narrative which is neither philological nor ontological but is formidably genetic.

As I try to mend the broken mower, its ratchet jammed somewhere inside the crank-case, I feel the blood all rush in a separate spiral, each genetically confirmed in the young heartlands beyond. The curious ones have their courses set towards fear and collapse, faces switch on and off, it is not any image of learning, but the gene pool itself defines these lively feelings. I get the casing off, sitting on the flat stone slab by the front door, you would think fortunes could be born here and you would be wrong. Their childish assertion is bleeding into the centre, we are determined that they shall do this: they look outwards to our idea of the planet. Their blood is battered by this idea, the rules for the replication of pattern guide their dreams safely into our dreams. The two ratchets are both rusted in; I file out their slots and brush out the corroded flakes with oil. They watch, and what they watch has nothing to do with anything. What they do is an 21 David Wood, 'Reiterating the Temporal: Toward A Rethinking of Heidegger on Time', in Reading Heidegger- Commemorations, ed. by John Sallis (Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1993), p.

I guess their capacity in pints, the dream-like membranes which keep their faces ready to see. The mower works now, related to nothing but the hand and purpose, the fear of collapse is pumped round by each linked system &amp; the borrowed warmth of the heart.22 The poem's first line describes the 'rise and fall' of childish rough-and- tumble play which is also readable as a dynastic succession of founding and ruin. The children are said to be outside, under a hot sun and on the periphery, 'the fringe', of the speaker's phenomenological awareness, as they approach in a garden, against the dazzling light. They are also in his thoughts, as he methodically and fastidiously works to 'mend the broken I mower': its spiral blade is stuck, the crank-shaft cannot move to turn the cutting blades. As he works, he thinks and feels: the poem is a subtle commingling of busy thought and blind sensation: there is an arterial surge of blood, a quickening and pressure in the vascular system: the blood's swirl and the form of the mower blades both allude to the double-helix of his intertwined DNA strands, which are copied in the developing and vital organisms of the children before him. The sentence beginning 'The curious ones ...' poses the first serious difficulty, not for the attempt to paraphrase, but for the desire to attribute a motive to its seemingly inflexible prediction, that those children who are most inquisitive and/or who are marked by a discernible oddness in manner have their lives determined, allotted, in the direction of a future anxiety, failure, breakdown. The sobering assessment eschews as customary and unrealistic the evaluations and wishes that parents contrive around their children and which Freud diagnoses as a symptom of parental narcissism,23 but the sentence continues, ruling out any merely strategic sobriety by ascribing the sentence of the sentence to the genetic operations and oppressions that control our predispositions and each physiological alteration, the parental endow- ment that has nothing to do with knowledge, or with scholarship, and which therefore could be said to be a life-sentence with no possibility of early release for good behaviour. It is the good or bad luck of the combination of all genes in an interbreeding population that will state the precise nature of the sentiments and sensitivities that animate a child's face. So the speaker reflects on the pleasure of this current experience in which he is engaged, the pleasure in intent activity while surrounded by the younger members of his family, and considers that such a pleasure might convince us that a 22 Poems, p.

What happens is the haemorrhaging of each idiosyncratic insistence of the childish self, 'bleeding into the centre', in a gradual convergence with the point of origin and influence. And 'we are determined | that they shall do this': the genetic forces are resolute in this determination, and the line-break tells us that each preceding, each succeeding generation is subject to the same imposition. The recent advances in genetics, most obviously and importantly the complete mapping of the human genome, have fomented an extraordinary and furiously combative series of controversies, many of which are focused upon or circle around just this question of determinism and the likelihood of its extent. Whether the despondent conclusion of the speaker in 'Acquisition of Love' is marked by the limits of the scientific knowledge available to the poet at the time (the late I96os) or whether there is some other explanation is a moot point. An essay by Nancy Wexler in a collection of articles by different hands about 'scientific and social issues in the human genome project' might provide one possibility for reading, without providing anything like a key to the poem.24 The essay examines the efforts made and the problems encountered in the search for the gene that causes the appalling hereditary disease, Huntington's Chorea, one of the singular qualities of which is, according to this article, that if children are observed to be suffering from the symptoms, they are found to 'almost invariably have inherited the disease from their fathers' (p. 213). The hunt for the gene required the study of a 'large extended multigenerational family' in which the disease was regularly being inherited and just such a family was located living in three relatively isolated villages (with a usefully limited gene pool) in Venezuela (p. 217). The team of which Wexler was a part travelled to the villages, researched the history of the family and tested for the disease, claiming to trace its incidence 'as far back as the early I8oos, to a woman appropriately named Maria Concepci6n' and establishing that there was a monstrously high proportion of the inhabitants of each village who did contract and had contracted Huntington's Chorea. Wexler's essay contains a passage which can be read next to 'Acquisition of Love', with the depiction of an easy and relatively free space, open to possibilities of play, leisure, and work, where a controlling genetic determinism below the level of normal sensible apprehen- sion frames each little event for a knowledgeable observer: In these small and impoverished towns, we estimate that there are over 660 asymptomatic gene carriers who are too young to show symptoms, but as years pass - if no treatment is found- they will surely die. It is crushing to look at these exuberant children full of hope and expectation, despite poverty, despite illiteracy, 24 Nancy Wexler, 'Clairvoyance and Caution: Repercussions from the Human Genome Project', in The Code of Codes: Scientific and Social Issues in the Human Genome Poject, ed. by Daniel J. Kevles and Leroy Hood (Cambridge, MIA, and London: Harvard University Press, i992), pp. 211-43. 242</page><page sequence="15">ROBIN PURVES despite dangerous and exhausting work for the boys fishing in small boats in the turbulent lake, or for even the tiny girls tending house and caring for ill parents, despite a brutalizing disease robbing them of parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins- they are joyous and wild with life, until the disease attacks. Every year we add more people to the pedigree who will suffer, diagnose more new cases, and watch helplessly as more and more begin that sad journey toward deterioration and death. (pp. 217-18) The 'fear and collapse' which is in store for 'the curious ones' is unlikely to involve such a debilitating disease as Huntington's, because the speaker/ father would no doubt already exhibit its grim set of symptoms; there is no evidence in the poem to indicate that the children who are singled out for suffering are in for anything more than a relatively difficult journey up their own life's 'blinding/gradient', thanks to the poisoned chalice of their genetic entailment. If there is, however, as I would like to suggest, a roughly homologous relation between the fields of linguistic philology and Heideg- gerian fundamental ontology and genetic phylogeny in their similarly recursive essentialisms, despite their own different resistances to the allegation of homology, they might all be said to be analogous to the ontogenetic narrative, the story of the entire sequence of events involved in the development of an individual organism, told retrospectively. Recursion to the hypothetical, originary parent, Indo-European, or to a truth of Being only capable of expression in the form of tautology, and the reversion of genetics to a postulated but empirically-verifiable, singular creation-event which began all life, valid or not, all suggest the immaculately conceived figure of a simple origin, the precedent, ultimately available, if distant from us, which represents the chance to say the thing itself, as it was before the violation of its pristine, original propriety: the familiar name of the child. 243</page></plain_text>
