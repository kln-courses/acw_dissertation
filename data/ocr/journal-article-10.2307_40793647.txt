<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Museum Ethnography No 12, 2000 CROSSED PERSPECTIVES ON THE IMAGERY OF THE AFRICAN BODY Michèle Coquet1 Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris I would like briefly to present two interpretations of ways of looking at African bodies in the arts. The following ideas occurred to me while studying African carvings representing chiefs' bodies. My examples come from the past of African history rather than the present, but I think that the questions they raise concern the present too. These questions also con- cern the museum sciences. I am thinking, in particular, of the plans for a new museum of art and anthropology in Paris, Le Musée des Arts et des Civilisations. For several months African Studies scholars, including myself, have met to reflect on themes for exhibitions in this future muse- um. I thought that crossed perspectives on the conception of the body would be an important theme. When the Europeans, after the Arabs, discovered African societies, they were startled by the nakedness. Like the Arabs, and for rather similar rea- sons, they were shocked. This perception of the African continent in terms of naked bodies still held for most of the continent in the 1950s, just before independence. The first images of African natives presented savages, often sketched in very classical and civilised postures. A seventeenth-century print (Fig 1) presents a Hottentot man and woman: the man is drawn in the front view inherited from ancient Greece, the feet somewhat separated. The woman's posture is more interesting. She symbolises an instinctive being, which for Europeans from the fifteenth to the nineteenth century corresponded to Africans. Her body and face are convulsed; her right breast is so long that she has thrown it over her shoulder to feed her child; and she is brandish- ing something that looks like a piece of intestine. In contrast with the man's, her convulsive bodily posture expresses wild, savage behaviour. In all likelihood, she is a cannibal. Her behaviour is monstrous even if her body is not, although some other bodies were, at least in a seventeenth- century description of Africans as born with 'headless trunks . . . eyes in their shoulders ... or eight toes on their soles' (cited by Butchart 1998 : 34). By the nineteenth century, the way Europeans looked at African bodies had not changed much. Several photographs show Africans in a way that brings to mind Renaissance descriptions of the inhabitants of the earth's far corners. These photos do not much differ from the curios collected for the Wunderkammer or cabinets de curiosités during the Renaissance. Over the 101</page><page sequence="2">Michèle Coquet Fig 1 Detail of an engrav- ing by Herbert, 1638, reproduced in Butchart 1998: Plate I. From Hirschberg, W.E. 1967.

Graz: Akademische Druk. centuries, the African body had become a visible reality, one that could be described, not phantasmic any longer but now real because photographed. But this body still seems absolutely strange and different. The land of Africa itself was still a place where travellers might experience 'marvels', like giant trees and very big animals. This Western view stares out in the photographs of how Africans transformed their bodies, or used body art as we would now say. This way of seeing and photographing bodies reminds us of the descriptions, written or pictorial, provided by sixteenth and seven- teenth-century travellers, even though Africans no longer have 'eyes and mouth in their chests'. In two photographs (Figs 2 &amp; 3), we see three women Figs 2 &amp; 3 Drawings by the author from two photographs published in Baschet, E. 1978. 1900- L'Afrique découvre l'Europe.

In the one with open mouths, ¿he tongue of the woman on the left has been touched up with no concern for objectivity. It is obviously too big. The strangeness of certain living beings continues to be a spectacle. When Europeans rediscovered Africa at the turn of the twentieth centu- ry, they discovered a dark continent with many never-visited lands, a terra incognita. Interpretations and descriptions could be fantastic, even though photographs were now supposed to prove that what was depicted was for real. In the late nineteenth century, this intellectual attitude affected the new science of anthropology. In photographs, the African body appears as mon- strous, a monstrosity due to very visible morphological transformations. The photographs of young women's bodies bearing scar marks come from this period. These depictions of African bodies suggest other interpretations. The body is still a focal point, a showpiece so strange that it magnifies the distance between the viewer and the viewed. Nonetheless, this scarred body is less strange than earlier portrayals. Two photographs taken in the first decades of the twentieth century show young women from, respectively, Benin and Burkina Faso (Plates 1 &amp; 2). Their ethnic group is not indicated. In the first figure, the same woman is presented from the front and back. In the second one, there are two different women, one seen from the front, the other from the back; but we have the impression that we are looking at the same woman. For the photographers, what was important was to show the scar marks on both the chests and backs. They tried to show how strange and hideous this practice, considered to be barbarous, was. But many other photographs, inspired by anthropometrical portrayals, reveal other points of view on African bodies. One particularly obvious 103</page><page sequence="4">Michèle Coquet view stands out in these pictures, namely the absence of individuality: these are the bodies of people who are objects. The photographer arranged these 'objects', as though there were pots or fruits, to compose the picture. These bodies were not handled any differently than the other objects that, during the same period, were collected for European museums: the ethnic origin was not consistently stated, nor the village or names of the persons photographed. Many of these photographs show us symmetrically arranged bodies: back and front views, three people in a line standing in the same posture, etc. The choice of symmetry was a way to visually express the will to dominate colonised peoples. No particular interest was shown in the designs of the scars, which were just considered as mutila- tions. These designs were not seen as an adornment, even less as way of conveying ideas. This portraying and understanding the African body as a strange object and as evidence of barbarous, backward practices and men- talities was itself an act of power. Butchart (1998: 55), who points to the role of medical and social techniques as means of social control and as a means for making African bodies and minds amenable to analysis and domination, states that, between the seventeenth and the first decades of the nineteenth century, 'the African body shed its fabulous qualities and for the first time emerged as a collection of overtly perceptible organs', i.e. noses, teeth, hands, skin, hair, feet, etc. According to him, the African body was seen as a surface, 'a collection or assemblage of external organs with- out an interior anatomy to unify them' (ibid.: 57). The African was not seen as an individual with the gift of reason and equal to Europeans. The idea that the body was reduced to its surface is quite interesting; I think that idea can still be detected in the work of photographers from the early twentieth century. The African body was presented as a pure exteriori- ty, whether the person was standing in a military posture, straight and motionless, or dancing. In several photographs, African men and women are dancing following initiation or agrarian rites. As in the preceding exam- ple, information is often lacking: the exact place, the village's name, the time of the year, the name of the dance, and so forth. As in the preceding docu- ment, we are presented with naked, or half naked bodies. Another type of photograph has become the model for exotic reporting, such as those taken by Leni Riefenstahl in the 1960s among the Nuba of Sudan. These pho- tographs were rightly criticised because they were marked by fascist ideolo- gy; they glorify physical force and purity, and African bodies are seen as perfect objects in service of an aesthetic of the spectacle (Green 1984: 36). In these photographs, we see young girls with oiled, ochred but otherwise naked bodies; their bellies have scar marks. The pictures were shot from below, near the subject's body; and this emphasises this presentation of the body as a pure appearance and exteriority. Once again, little information is 104</page><page sequence="5">Crossed perspectives on the imagery of the African body provided about what is shown: these bodies seem to exist as pure adorned surfaces, as if the nakedness were a screen for keeping us from seeing the African body in any other way. The African body is thus presented like a landscape. For a long time, Westerners considered anthropomorphic African sculp- tures to be objects without any artistic or aesthetic value. These sculptures were neglected by the first collectors unless they had been produced for a court, i.e. in a society with a form of government and state. I would like to give a few examples drawn from among the Chokwe. These sculptures belong to what is called 'court arf . They present chiefs' bodies. Here too, but in a different way, the showing of a naked body is a form of power. Unlike in colonial images, what is depicted here is royal power as incarnated in a body. There is very little information on Chokwe art, and little is known about the function of such sculptures, despite the studies made by Marie-Louise Bastin (1982). By the last decades of the nineteenth century, sculptures of chiefs were no longer being made. At that time the Chokwe, driven by illness and hunger, migrated from the centre of Angola into southern Angola and north into the Democratic Republic of Congo. In the first quarter of the twentieth century, this migration and impoverishment undermined Chokwe chieftain- cies and the court arts gradually ceased to exist. This Chokwe art form shows us either great Chokwe chiefs or else Chibinda Ilunga, the mythic founder of the Lunda and later Chokwe dynasties, venerated as the hero who introduced hunting and invented powerful talismans. This mythical figure can be recognised by certain attributes, but the carvings representing chiefs do not enable identification, since the chiefs are always depicted in a limited number of conventional postures. Carvings of Chibinda show him wearing a headdress with wings curving backwards on each side, a sign of Chokwe sovereigns. He holds the insignia of the hunter (Plate 3): in his right hand, the staff where protec- tive charms are hung; and in his left, a stone gun or an animal horn where magic powders can be placed. Certain sculptures show Chibinda with other objects, such as a calabash containing gunpowder or a knife, axe or protective amulet attached to his belt. Chiefs are presented wearing the same kind of headdress. Like the hunter-hero, they are shown nude (Plate 4). Various physical postures, reproducing the court body language, are depicted. Chiefs are shown standing or seated on a throne. When standing, the chief extends his hands toward his groin or slightly in front of his belly. Hands in front of the chest, a gesture called taci, are a sign of force and power. When seated, the chief makes the mwoyo gesture of clapping his hands; he thus dispenses well-being and prosperity by blessing his sub- jects. For the Chokwe, these sculptures mainly served to depict the chief either as the person who performs essential symbolic functions (as indicat- 105</page><page sequence="6">Michèle Coquet Plate 3 Chibinda Ilunga.

These statues express the sacred- ness of sovereignty by fixing in material form the gestures essential to the kingdom. But this statuary has other features. It presents a 'naturalism' in the carving of the ears, cheek lines, and nose: a meticulous observation of faces. But even more remarkable is the attention the sculptors gave to shap- ing the chief's muscles, hands and feet, the latter too big in relation to the rest of his body. The carvings representing Chibinda Ilunga emphasise these features even more; the exaggerated size of his hands may express his exceptional agility; of his feet, his endurance during hunting parties. This statuary depicts the royal body's exceptional nature. Like the arms and legs, the face too is treated realistically, as well as the hands and feet, appar- 106</page><page sequence="7">Crossed perspectives on the imagery of the African body Plate 4 Chokwe chief .

Among the Chokwe, the monarch's exceptional nature was vested in his body, whose vitality and power, as for all African kings and chiefs, vouchsafe the kingdom. For African leaders, kings or chiefs, physical imperfections and infirmi- ties were, and still are, prohibited, at least in theory. Hence, the king's body and face, and the portrayal of them, apparently have to provide an ideal view of the man as an adult in full possession of his physical and spiritual faculties. The sovereign's body concentrates his people's aspirations. The Chokwe chief's tense muscles are a sign of excessive bodily vitality. Chok- we statuary shows us exceptional beings. But anthropomorphic imagery in traditional Africa usually serves this purpose. Such statues present an ideal of humanity; and the naked body conveys a certain idea of mankind. 107</page><page sequence="8">Michèle Coquet The two perspectives on the African body I have chosen are not equiva- lent. In the one, the view of the African body comes from the West, as it pro- posed successive interpretations of a culture that it felt to be radically differ- ent, even alien. In the other, the view under discussion is part of an African culture, of the society that produced the statues. On the one hand, drawings and photographs; on the other, carvings. Despite these differences, these examples can be compared in terms of intentionality. The way of looking at African societies during precolonial and colonial times, of seeing them as inferior, determined how these societies were depicted. Owing to their strangeness, African customs were hard to understand. Consequently, the way of seeing and portraying African people, especially as naked, reveals the unbridgeable gap between these two views. The contemporary interest in exotic pictures that exhibit vanishing ways of life and authentic traditions demands images not much different from those produced during the colo- nial era. In African art, and this is still true, statuary tends to show subjects as naked. The Chokwe example provides us with another perception of the body: what is shown is not just the chief's exceptional qualities as expressed through his body. These qualities are those of the ideal human being whom the chief symbolically represents. What this statuary tells us is that the body is not an object, or a 'landscape', but the expression of a subject, in this case the chief, whose tense muscles, big hands and feet represent his physical qualities (such as strength, endurance, agility or vigour) and his intellectual and spiritual qualities (cleverness, craftiness, hardheadness, supernatural powers). What is, and must be, the specific person of the chief in reality was transcribed into the shapes of his body as shown by a carving or as praised in song. To be a chief in real life meant making gestures and acting; it involved the body. But this is also true for men who were not chiefs. These examples remind us that every body contains the memory of its accom- plished actions, of its dynamic involvement in life, and of the intentionality that directed its actions. Notes 1 .
