<plain_text><page sequence="1">BEN JONSON AND THE ILLUSION OF COMPLETENESS BY L. A. BEAURLINE IN Our Knowledge of the External World, Ber- trand Russell makes a significant distinction between two kinds of infinity. One kind is illus- trated by the progression from zero to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, on to infinity; Russell calls this an infinite pro- gression, and it is unlimited. The other idea is illustrated by the division of an interval be- tween, say, one and two; first divide it into halves, then divide each of those halves, and so on in- finitely. This is a compact series or an infinite class, and it is limited. The infinite progression and the infinite class are quite different ideas, and they have different philosophical uses. I suggest that a similar distinction may be made concerning literary forms, and that this distinc- tion helps us to understand what is new about Ben Jonson's dramatic method. The distinc- tion reverberates through seventeenth-century literature, I believe, but Jonson is especially in- teresting because he is somewhat of a pioneer. Seventeenth-century writers, however, did not usually call the idea infinity; their word was plenitude, and of course they did not mean to imply mathematical infinity when they spoke of plenitude; the common synonyms were complete- ness or fullness and before the seventeenth cen- tury the familiar model for fullness was the world itself: the plenum of species, the gradation of levels of being, and the continuity of existence from the lowest speck of dust to the highest of the angels all went together to make the grand scheme of the world and the great model for comprehensive literary works. A. O. Lovejoy traced the genealogy of this idea in his Great Chain of Being, and a generation of scholars has shown its relevance to the works of Dante, Chaucer, Spenser, and Shakespeare. But Love- joy and others have not paid enough attention to a relatively new idea that emerged most clearly in the seventeenth century, the idea of a "limited" completeness, a sort of compact series. Shortly after the turn of the century, we begin to see in the writings of Bacon, Jonson, Burton, and possibly Drayton, an interest in setting strict limits to a composition and aiming to ex- haust the possibilities within those limits. This seems to me to be a new principle of organization, and I think it helped to generate a number of new techniques of writing. The philosophical implications are most clear in Bacon, who openly scoffed at the idea of cor- respondences between man and nature, be- 51 tween the earth and the heavens. To think that man is a microcosm, says Bacon, is a treacherous analogy that leads man to measure all things by the standards of his mind, a false idol. Rather, Bacon insists, we should anatomize the world, break it into small parts, segment knowledge, and gather all the data we can within each little category. If you want to know all you can about the winds, do not look for anthropomorphic or teleological explanations, but rather collect all you can about the behavior of wind itself. In time, this method led to the disastrous separa- tion of science from religion, of morals from psychology, and of man from nature, but it was very fruitful for science, and I think it was fruit- ful for literature as well, if we examine Ben Jonson's plays. Jonson, along with the more advanced writers of the seventeenth century, chose to be less cosmic than his predecessors and less quantita- tive, more selective and exhaustive. At least in his major comedies he shows an impressive mastery of the art of limiting and of completeness within those limits. In Timber (written ca. 1623) he criticized those who judge "wholly by the bulke, think rude things greater then polish'd; and scatter'd more numerous then compos'd," and he scorned those who turn over books and write out "what they presently find or meet, without choice" and those who "speake all they can (how ever unfitly)"; on the other hand, Jon- son admired "composition," "election," "wis- dome in dividing," within the confines of a nar- row subject, laid out in a sufficient plot. The plot, nevertheless, should seek its "utmost bounds," and "every bound, for the nature of the Subject, is esteem'd the best that is largest, till it can increase no more: so it behooves the Action in Tragedy or Comedy to be let grow, till neces- sity ask a Conclusion."' Jonson's comic plots are like the working out of a series of permutations with a fixed number of constants and one variable. What are the maximum number of combinations of character and situation that can be represented onstage within the limits of the subject without repeating a single pattern? The resulting form of the plays in his middle period, from 1609-14, seems curi- Ben Jonson, ed. C. H. Herford, Percy and Evelyn Simp- son (Oxford, 1925-52), vIIm, 583, 586-587, 646-647.

We can easily follow the development of two or three threads of action in the usual comedy, such as Twelfth Night, The Shoemaker's Holiday, or Every Man in His Humour. Whereas in Jonson's mature plays, after Volpone, when he seems to have found his metier in English settings, there appear a welter of characters and episodes, whirl- ing within a central situation. The unity of these plays has been variously explained in terms of image clusters, of a central extravagant conceit, and most recently as an adaptation of the tech- nique of the morality play.2 We should appreciate the insights in such interpretations, and I think it is reasonable to believe that Jonson was partly indebted to the late moralities and that he was interested in the art of old Greek comedy, but for the moment I want to consider the im- pulse toward a kind of controlled completeness, to see if it will bring us a little closer to Jonson's design. The Alchemist (1611) seems to offer the clearest example of this artifice. One reason for the play's power, I think,is the way Jonson has fashioned the material into something like a compact series. Let us imagine the difficulties that he had to overcome. Assum- ing that he began with the idea of a play about a confidence game, he needed at least three princi- pal rogues-an inside man, some bait, and a "rope" or outside man (Subtle, Dol Common, and Face). Once he was committed to his con- fidence men, he needed a large number of vic- tims or "fish," for the sake of variety, surprise, wonder, and the audience's sense of the power of the rogues themselves. It would be dull to play with only one or two fish, so Jonson chose a representative group, seven people who display a limited range of the social spectrum of a city (and two country folk), from a knight down to a tobacconist, from a shrewd fellow like Surly to an utter fool like Dapper. He also chose to give them various degrees of credulity-from Mammon, who will believe almost anything he conceives, to Surly, who believes nothing-so that the fools in their quest for money or posi- tion provide a delightful anatomy of credulity. At the top of the scale is Mammon, who was normally a "grave" sir, a rich man who had no need, but once he was bitten by the alchemical bug, he lost all power of judgment; his imagina- tion is distended; he is flattered by his own argu- ments and his grandiose schemes. He will be a patron of the arts and a benefactor of mankind. His appetite for sensual pleasure is the most monstrous of all, for he imagines a dozen crude means he will use to stimulate his lust, and ulti- mately he wishes to play the part of Jove, com- ing in a shower of gold to every mistress; he will drink the elixir and enjoy a perpetuity of lust. This fully developed character, therefore, stands as an emblem of the other clients, all who lack reason and judgment; their desires have control over their imagination and their imagination over their actions. Each customer is a variation on Mammon. Their common deficiency of judg- ment is often represented by their language. In the words of Jonson's address to the reader, their speech is a "simple mocking at terms, when they understand not the things." Several char- acters are identifiable by some empty affectations of speech: Ananias by the words of Old Testa- ment prophets, Kastril by the terms of conduct- ing an argument, Mammon by the high-flown alliterative diction of Marlovian tragedy. It seems appropriate therefore that they should be cozened by Subtle's alchemical mumbo jumbo and Dol Common's meaningless raving in terms from Hugh Broughton's learned controversy. But Jonson's choice of numerous clients im- mediately created new problems of unity, be- cause the play was likely to break up into epi- sodes. As early as Every Man Out of His Humour (1599), he recognized the danger of episodic actions, when he allowed the choral character Cordatus to comment on the suggestion of Mitis that each character be presented in single scenes, one for each character: "That had beene single indeed: why? be they not the same persons in this [one crowded scene], as they would have beene in those? and is it not an object of more state, to behold the Scene full, and reliev'd with varietie of speakers to the end, then to see a vast emptie stage, and the actors come in (one by one) as if they were dropt downe with a feather, into the eye of the spectators?" But in The Al- chemist, the interviews with the victims had to be kept as separate as possible for the confidence game to work; consequently Jonson made this 2 See Edward Partridge, The Broken Compass (New York, 1958) and John Enck, Jonson and the Comic Truth (Madison, Wis., 1957). The extravagant conceit as part of Jonson's debt to old comedy is explained by Ray Heffner, Jr., in his "Unifying Symbols in the Comedy of Ben Jonson," English Stage Comedy, ed. W. K. Wimsatt, Jr. (New York, 1955), pp. 74-97. The adaptation of late morality form is discussed by Alan Dessen in "The Alchemist: Jonson's 'Estates' Play," Renaissance Drama, vri (1964), 35-54. Dessen is on the verge of making my point when he sees a "panoramic cross section of English society" in The Alchemist and Bartholomew Fair, (pp. 49-50), but he has not shown the importance of Jonson's strict limits on his material. I do not find his conception of thesis and demonstration specific enough to tell us much about Jonson. 52</page><page sequence="3">L. A. Beaurline need a major part of the tension. He always has the second visitor come right on the heels of the first, the third on the heels of the second, so that Face and Subtle always have too little time, and they have to hustle Dapper offstage (put him "on the send" as con men say), in order to make room for Ananias. At first the transitions be- tween episodes are leisurely, later they are quickened. This illusion is suggested to the audi- ence by little remarks, such as "Pray god, I ha' not stai'd too long" (i.vi.95), "0, no, not yet this houre" (III.iii.76), "Gods lid, we never thought of him, till now. Where is he?" (III.v.51- 52). By the middle of Act in the crowding has become so dense that something has to break. The stupidest gulls-Dapper, Drugger, and Kastril-are dealt with simultaneously, effi- ciently making the advice to Drugger serve as an example to Dapper. Mammon has come too soon, so Dapper must be pushed into the privy, with gingerbread in his mouth. This is the first serious overlapping of clients. In the middle of Act iv, the first climax of the play, the overlap becomes more serious, with two clients, Mammon and the Spanish nobleman, asking for the services of Dol Common, so that a new exchange must be made. Typical of Face's genius for improvisation, Dame Pliant is given to the Spaniard. Then the first major triumph occurs when Mammon has been gulled and suc- cessfully "brushed off." Immediately (iv.vi) there follows a second climax, a nearly complete disaster, for Surly has told Dame Pliant how she was cheated, Subtle collapses, but Face counter- reverses and saves the day by turning the other victims upon their would-be-deliverer. Economy is the watchword. If more and more clients are going to fill the stage, Face will put them to use as ingeniously as possible, in all possible com- binations. Composing the scene artistically, us- ing subordinate characters as his tools, he in- duces Kastril to try out his new technique of arguing; Ananias is shown the papist in his Spanish slops and cries against the "profane, lewd, superstitious, and idolatrous breeches." So they drive Surly offstage. The rogues breathe a sigh of relief, just as a new disaster comes to their door because Lovewit has returned without warning. The rest of the plot is built in the same way, forming a compact series, with repeated turns and counterturns, with successively greater crises, and more and more people crowding on- stage.3 Face's wit is always equal to each crisis, only to be surprised by a greater challenge. At each maneuver the situation becomes funnier, and at each turn the characters are drained of some of their humanity. The mess of brass, pew- ter, and iron in the basement is a leitmotif that recurs through the whole play, a kind of proof of Face's power of intrigue. Although never seen by the audience, it figures prominently in the dialogue, and Face rings the changes on it wondrously. The iron was contributed by Mammon, sold to Ananias and Tribulation as widow's and orphan's goods, sold again to Kas- tril to furnish his house, and finally given to Lovewit as an inducement to protect Face's secret. Everything except the metal dissolves into nothing, an insubstantial show. Such art is the epitome of Jonson's skill-to vary, to press a matter to its greatest potential, to please us at the same time that we stand admiring the subtle means by which our feelings are manipulated. It must have been a delight to find that a writer could imitate the fullness of God's crea- tion, to achieve an exhaustive order and grada- tion, if not correspondence of all the parts, so dear to contemporary religion, philosophy, and literature. The key to it was the arbitrary limita- tion of the situation, and the rules for a con- fidence game. In other words, a restricted field, a set number of persons, and some simple princi- ples for the game. Modern writers, such as Joyce, Beckett, and Ionesco, have rediscovered the uses of such principles in literature-when Joyce chooses to allude to only actual places in Dublin, or to restrict events to only one certain day, or to use words from only a certain re- stricted list. The esthetic of such writing seems to involve our sense that the fullness of life (or the emptiness of life for that matter) is being repre- sented in one intense moment.4 The difference, however, between Jonson and the moderns is that he is much more schematic about it, and he gives us more of the gradations within limits. II Insofar as this sort of plentitude can be repre- sented in literature, it should not be confused with the medieval and renaissance encyclopedic forms. Commentators on Homer and Virgil found all the world's learning somehow implicit in the ancient epics; Macrobius did the same with only Cicero's Dream of Scipio; Dante and ' Paul Goodman, The Structure of Literature (Chicago, 1954), p. 85, makes a similar observation. Also see the men- tion of the Alchemist in Richard Levin's very thorough dis- cussion of "The Structure of Bartholomew Fair," PMLA, Lxxx (1965), 176. 4See Hugh Kenner's "Art in a Closed Field," VQR, xxxvm (1962), 597-613, to which I am generally indebted. 53</page><page sequence="4">Ben Jonson and the Illusion of Completeness Spenser tried to comprehend as much as possible in their major works, to represent the full range of human experience, moral, political, and divine, and they composed on a grand scale, like the infinite progression. In the drama, Shakespeare was similarly broad, depicting in his history plays the entire social spectrum from Mistress Quickly to Queen Katherine, from Nym to Prince Hal, with suitable gradations between. "When Shakespeare's mind was working in- tensely it was aware of the whole range of the universe: events were not isolated but took place concurrently with other events on all the planes of existence."5 Some of the old-fashioned taste survived in the seventeenth century in a more restricted collection like Herrick's Hesperides (1648), which attempts to suggest a complete progression of delights (itemized in the "Argu- ment of his Book"): rising by degrees he sings of simple nature (the external world), of the movement of the seasons, of men and women who take part in the festivals of the year, of the role of love in these celebrations, of divine gifts that come from the air (such as dew and rain), of the allegorical meaning of things, and at last of darkness and the final things of life. As Sidney Musgrove has clearly demonstrated, Hesperides contains an implicit universe, full of life, death, wit, and lamentation.6 That universe is reflected in little bits, scattered insights, concealed little treasures. But Herrick is much more than the last Elizabethan: he is also one of the sons of Ben. If we excerpt just the Julia poems from Hesperides, we see something more like what I find in Jonson: an illusion that all of Julia's parts have been celebrated-Julia's hair in a net, her hair filled with dew, her blush, her lips, her breath, her teeth, her voice, her neck, roses in her bosom, her breasts, the nipples of her breast, her arms, her wrists, her hands, her legs, her jewelry, her petticoat; Julia weeping, unlacing, washing, going to church, praying; her fall, her recovery, her death, her bed, her picture, and so on, for at least fifty-two poems. The effect is much like Melville's white whale; nowhere do we see the entire Julia but our imagination has been activated enough to create its own com- plete woman. And she is allowed to suggest several sorts of women: a flower of a girl, a modest friend, an amorous mistress, a nun, a saint, and the Virgin Mary. Other signs intimate the new seventeenth-cen- tury taste for exhaustive treatment; the barom- eter of book titles is especially sensitive. In book titles of the sixteenth century the usual presen- tation of a compilation was frankly quantita- tive: A Hundreth Good Pointes of Husbandrie (1557), or obviously emblematic like The Castel of Helth (1541), The Bankette of Sapience (1539), The Myrroure for Magistrates (1559), and A Glassefor Gamesters (1581). The Anatomy had a brief vogue in works of satiric or hortatory analysis such as The Anatomy of Abuses (1583), The Anatomy of Absurdity (1589), The Anatomie of a Christian Man (1611), and Follies Anatomy or Satyres and Satyricall Epigrams (1619), but it was soon displaced by a more neutral word that called attention to its main purpose, mostly in popular handbooks of the time. So there was published The Compleat Gentlemen (1622), A Compleat Parson (1630), The Complete Farriar (1639), The Compleat Angler (1655), and The Complete Gamester (1674), among hundreds of similar titles that continued to pour out in the Restoration and eighteenth century. The word complete seems exactly to have caught the tem- per of the times. Apparently by the early 1600's literate Eng- lishmen thought it was possible to encompass a whole subject more thoroughly than ever before. The old encyclopedic motive had turned into the new organum, by realization that some limi- tations had to be put upon a topic of inquiry; specialization and method became more and more important. The learned men anatomized their subjects, and tried to exhaust them, actu- ally. In literature, it was recognized that there was a rhetoric of the anatomy (and this is where illusion becomes important), as Bacon explained the traditional topic of division: "So when a great moneyed man hath divided his chests and coines and bags, hee seemeth to himselfe richer than hee was, and therefore a way to amplifie any thing, is to breake it, and to make an ana- tomie of it in severall partes, and to examine it according to severall circumstances. And this maketh the greater shew if it be done without order, for confusion maketh things muster more, and besides what is set downe by order and di- vision, doth demonstrate that nothing is left out or omitted, but all is there; whereas if it be with- out order, both the minde comprehendeth lesse that which is set downe, and besides it leaveth a suspition, as if more might be sayde then is ex- pressed."7 John Hoskins, a teacher of prose style to Jacobean gentlemen, copied part of this 6 E.

Beaurline passage into his Directions for Speech and Style (ed. Hoyt Hudson, Princeton, 1935) under the heading "Division" (p. 22). He added some hints about specifying parts. "So in saying a fair tree you may divide it into the roots, body, branches, and fruit; and fairness into tallness, straightness, fresh color, and such things as are fair in a tree" (p. 24). "This in some sort used is more properly called dilation than amplification; and being after practised will enable you to dis- course almost of anything wherein you are not precisely tied to the exact manner of division with use, but you have liberty of seeking all things compassed within the sense of your gen- eral theme." The emphasis, we should notice, falls upon a unity of theme, a seeking out of all things within a limited subject, as means of achieving "dila- tion" or fullness, in contrast with the older more simply quantitative method of achieving copi- ousness. Traditional rhetoric had not supplied authors with many rules for the composition of a whole poem, beyond the divisions between praefatio and narratio; therefore it was found con- venient to adopt certain quantitative, numerical schemes of organization based upon numbers such as 3, 7, 12, 33, and 100, with twelve books, thirty-three cantos, or a hundred lines. As Ernst Curtius remarked: "Roman poetry could offer the Middle Ages some models of numerical composition. Perhaps the Psalms are also to be taken into consideration. . ., a stimulus to numerical composition in 'Biblical poetics.' I should, however, prefer to see the final causes of the spread of this technique of composition first in the concept of number as sacred and secondly in the lack of other precepts for the dispositio. By the use of numerical composition the medi- eval author attained a twofold end: a formal scaffolding to build upon, and a symbolic pro- fundity."8 In the drama there was a similar lack, among renaissance theorists, of a satisfactory account of unity of action, and most theoretical state- ments went little beyond the traditional quanti- tative parts of a play: the protasis, epitasis, and catastrophe, or the setting forth of the first ac- tion, tying the knot, and unraveling. As Made- leine Doran noticed, this is an inadequate plan on which to develop a unified plot, and the Elizabethans searched for ways of achieving more careful design. Some writers relied upon a titanic hero, such as Tamburlaine, to supply a sort of biographical unity. Some were satisfied with a narrative sequence of scenes that was frankly episodic. Shakespeare and some of his contemporaries most often tried to double and triple the plot, making subplots echo or parody the main plot, in order to create a thematic unity. "Multiple unity" (Miss Doran's term) was therefore possible, made from disparate and often contrasting elements, but joined by a qualitative principle-an idea or tone.9 Jonson solved the problem in quite a different way, it seems to me, because in his mature comedies, after Volpone, he rejected not only episodic or narrative form but subplot, over- plot, and parallel plot as well. Instead, he placed stricter limits on time, place, and event, com- posing within more highly integrated scenes, and calling attention to the qualitative gradations of tone and meaning. Miss Doran may have noticed this in her comments on Jonson's "remorseless logic" in the unraveling of his plots, the "perfect rationality of cause and consequence in Jonson's closed world" (pp. 330-331); "he creates a wholly logical world in which the interplay of the interest of his characters moves the plot towards a necessary conclusion. Though there may be a plentiful use of coincidence in the plot, it is part of the data the author makes his char- acters manipulate in solving their problems." On the other hand, Shakespeare lets "happy chance" determine outcome (p. 339). These dif- ferences may be caused by Jonson's greater dependence on one central intrigue, but the remorseless logic also works through the elabo- rate pattern, the repetition of one basic device, with seemingly infinite gradations and varia- tions of application. How often, for instance, he relies on the situation where a foolishly wise fellow gulls himself; how perfectly circularand infinitely various is the plot that eventually brings the cleverest manipulator to expose him- self. The logic of such a plot derives not so much from strict application of cause and effect as from the accumulated expectations of the audi- ence: the illusion of perpetual irony and the sense of graduated intensity, inversion built upon inversion, until the final self-laceration must be enacted by the cleverest man of all. That kind of development is like a compact series; a relatively new way of composing with theme and variation within limits, and for many 8 European Literature of the Latin Middle Ages, trans.

Copiousness was displaced by a more selective variety and con- trast, gradations within strict limits. This method produced some of the best comedies in the language, perhaps because it brings the drama closer to the wellspring of laughter, as a play seems to work out one great joke, reducing human beings to mechanical reflexes, locking them in a pattern that they must complete. III Rather than multiply examples of what should be fairly obvious by now, I want to speculate for a moment about Jonson's attitude toward this method and suggest a possible reason for his change in artistic strategy. If his method differs from traditional ways of achieving copiousness, it should also be differentiated from the work of others in his time. By the Restoration, Dryden recognized that the love of variety was a special feature of English taste, and as a principle it helped to explain the irregularities in English plays. Odd characters, bold language, and in- genious mixed plots had to be allowed because they gave freer play to imagination in a livelier representation of nature. But Jonson thought that mere variety or novelty was a sign of luxurious decadence. Perhaps Dryden noticed this attitude but did not think it needed com- ment in his "examen of the Silent Woman." At any rate, we should remember Jonson's com- ments on the corrupt taste in Catiline's Rome, where novel variety was the only stimulus of a surfeited aristocracy (I.i). Sir Epicure Mam- mon's fantastic diet (Alchemist I.i), Volpone's restless search for novel experience, and Cris- pinus' foolish straining for novelty in words, in the Poetaster, show that Jonson felt strong dis- approval of mere variety. Good taste and good morals were inseparable for him, and he con- stantly set the plain old virtues and the plain style in contrast with luxurious, vulgar, and dis- honest contemporary life. A vulgar person has no ability to compose himself or choose taste- fully, for he lacks the requisite knowledge of alternatives. In short, he has no judgment. He tires of the usual old pleasures because he does not understand their art, and he wants a variety of diversion, as much as money can buy. We may wonder, therefore, whether some of the art of Jonson's great London comedies may be an attempt to please the very same people he is satirizing. Are these plays, so packed with modern grossness, so full of surprising new twists of plot and unusual characters, designed to ap- peal to the very popular taste that the author deplores? If so, we must still presume that Jon- son intends this pleasure to be superficial, and that he expects the more discerning members of his audience to see the joke. It is not so much a matter of "imitative form" as a rhetorical strategy. As Jonas Barish has observed, the prologues to Epicoene and subsequent plays con- fess that he aimed to delight his audiences more than before, to administer "sweet" remedies to the grossness and folly that was bred in his contemporaries.10 The construction of Epicoene (ca. 1609), The Alchemist (1611), Bartholomew Fair (1614), and perhaps A Tale of a Tub (which I assume was written well after 1614), ap- proaches the very condition that it satirizes. This phenomenon may be an example of the psy- chological principle of attraction to opposites: the more contemptuous Jonson became of his audience the more he adapted his artistic strat- egy to ridicule their taste. So the plays seem to turn on themselves more and more, exposing the taste for newness in the fools, in the rogues who expose the fools, and in the "artists" who serve them both. It may be significant that the "con- triving" men in these mature plays are them- selves lovers of the unusual-Face, Littlewit, and the lowest of them all, Medlay. (Truewit's taste is a special problem, which I will comment on below.) Medlay is especially interesting be- cause he is overtly satirized and he makes an entertainment, a mask for the assembled cast in Act v of A Tale of a Tub. He admits that his "cooper's wit" is small: "I have little knowledge in designe, / Which I can varie Sir, to Infinito" (v.vii. 10-11), but his mask is just a bare rehears- al of the events that preceded, in five motions corresponding to the five acts of the play. At the end Medlay presents the maskers to their counterparts and both are presented to the audience-a literal exhaustion of invention. The feat of Jonson's more successful art, how- ever, is like James Joyce's when he turns vul- garity and roguery to artistic use. At the same time that he laughs at the brainless proliferation of impressions he can show a power of artistic economy, work that "'tis so ramm'd with life, / That it shall gather strength of life, with being, / And live hereafter more admir'd, then now."1 He rationally limits and selects when he 10 Ben Jonson and the Language of Prose Comedy (Cam- bridge, Mass., 1960), pp. 176-177. 11 Horace's praise of Virgil in Jonson's Poetaster (v.i.136- 138). 56</page><page sequence="7">L. A. Beaurline seems to exhaust the potential formal constitu- ents. Thus the plays artfully seem artless. Bartholomez Fair offers the most complex and challenging example of Jonson's art of exhaus- tion, in a play truly "ramm'd with life." Since Richard Levin has recently shown most of the features of the plot that I would cite, I need not go into detail. Several of Levin's observations, however, should be emphasized: first, that the design of the play rests upon not the fair itself but upon the various effects that it has on the visitors; second, that beneath the apparent muddle of people the contrasts and groupings of characters suggest several scales or gradations of understanding. The censors, Wasp, Busy, and Overdo, are treated in an especially schematic way. They are the "serious asses" contrasted with the "little asses" whom they try to super- vise, and their encounters with the fair occur in three parallel major scenes: ii.vi, where Overdo tries to reform Edgworth; III.vi, Busy's attack on the gingerbread stands; and iv.iv, Wasp's game of vapors. Like The Alchemist, the action pro- ceeds in a quickening tempo, from minimal con- tact between the groups of visitors to maximum entanglement and realignment.12 The stupid game of vapors is, no doubt, central to the theme of the play, as several critics have observed; for it epitomizes most of the visitors. They overdo everything, lacking warrant for what they say. They do not know what their words mean, and like Overdo himself, they blunder into contra- diction and nonsense. The members of the audi- ence at the puppet show display various degrees of perception. Some see the motion as just a pup- pet show; some think they are in the legitimate theater; some like Mrs. Overdo are too stupid with food and drink to be aware of anything in their surroundings; some use the puppet show as a device to help them win a wife or seduce a woman. Zeal of the Land Busy sees the show as a profane idol, an object of hypocritical attack. Overdo stands at the back, the master sleuth, witnessing some great "enormity." When he thinks he is exposing great crimes, he finds him- self exposed-wholly mistaken about everyone's identity. His own wife vomits just as he is about to arrest the crowd. Like Sir Epicure Mammon, Overdo is, therefore, an extreme example, a model, of the frailties of the rest of the fools. He must, in the final comic reversal, remember that he is Adam, mere flesh and blood, and hence in need of grace like everyone else. The satiric implications of Jonson's method may be suggested in the induction, where the book-holder sneers at the ignorant stage-keeper, and says that nevertheless in "most o' this matter" the stage-keeper is competent to judge, for "the Author hath writ it just to his Meridian, and the Scale of grounded Judgements here, his Play-fellowes in wit." Hence, Jonson had delib- erately lowered and limited his art to meet the taste of the audience at the Hope Theater. He further suggests that there is a special decorum about his Bartholomew play, the theater "being as durty as Smithfield, and as stinking every whit." He assures his auditors that they are go- ing to see things as they know them, without romantic or fantastic claptrap-no tales, tem- pests, and such like Drolleries, no jigs, jugglers, and apes, such as many of the audience may like, but still he will please all with the puppet show. He chiefly promises that the play will be merry, "and as full of noise, as sport: made to delight all, and to offend none," which seems to imply that the fullness and confusion we find in the play has been calculated to appeal to popular taste. Littlewit's puppet show is a travesty of the Hero and Leander story, so pathetic that it is funny. It too has been deliberately lowered-not a product of wit inspired by expensive canary wine, but that from cheap beer, Littlewit says (I.i.37-39), and the stage audience's mixed re- sponse to the puppets parallels Jonson's expected response from the theater audience, as the in- duction says. Again there is explicit gradation when each person is asked to judge indepen- dently and according to the degree of his wit, facetiously classified according to the price of admission he has paid: "It shall bee lawfull for any man to judge his six pen'orth, his twelve pen'orth, so to his eighteene pence, 2. shillings, halfe a crowne, to the value of his place: Pro- vided alwaies his place get not above his wit." Such a range of "censures" he will allow, in a little series with specific limitations-that no one will censure for another man unless he pays for that man's admission (and he keeps him silent), and that no one will discover some concealed political allegory in the play. It seems legitimate to interpret these legal provisos as another ex- ample of Jonson's playful use of the esthetic of variety, but variety within limits. Where play- fulness has blended into satire or where they coexist in Bartholomew Fair is very hard to de- cide, but, knowing Jonson's other plays and these distinct hints of a lowered aesthetic ap- peal, I cannot avoid feeling that he has some comic detachment, some reserve of contempt for the material he is playing with, and perhaps some 12 See Levin, pp. 176-178. 57</page><page sequence="8">Ben Jonson and the Illusion of Completeness contempt for the game he is playing. He seems to want his more understanding critics to feel the same way. I suggest that Jonson hit upon this method while he was working on the main plot of Vol- pone (acted 1605), where vulgar, jaded taste was a part of the comic matter, showing the decadent times. The confidence game in this play may also have encouraged him to multiply similar epi- sodes, but he held himself back, perhaps because he wrote for more educated audiences at the two universities. At any rate the subplot there is an echo rather than a variation of the main plot; hence the play could not fully exploit the artistic motive. When he came to Epicoene (1609) he appears to have abandoned the conventional double plot, in favor of proliferation of character, event, and talk, in order to concentrate on a narrower range of possibilities. The effect is a combination of economy and turmoil-stupid- ity, noise, and foolishness woven into an amaz- ingly intricate and repetitive pattern. A single scene in Epicoene illustrates the two qualities I have mentioned-the formal ringing of changes and the satiric exposure of bad taste, this time the bad taste of the "coterie" audience at the Whitefriars Theater.l3 In Act v Truewit arranges his climactic practical joke as if it were a literary composition. Cutbeard and Otter have been transformed by a change of clothes into a canon and civil lawyer, who will examine the twelve possibilities of a divorce. Morose has been driven so far by female babble that he has fairly asked for this final lacerating inquisition. The Collegiate ladies have played their game right into Dauphine and Truewit's hands, so that their every reaction can be controlled. Truewit stations himself at one door, Dauphine at the other, and Clerimont in the midst so that Morose cannot escape when the lawyers "grow hot once." "And then the women," Truewit says, "as I have given the bride her instructions, . . . breake in upon him i' the l'envoy. O, 'twill be full and twanging!" What follows is, indeed, full and twanging, in a series of gradations as one sur- prising reversal follows another, in Jonson's finest high jinks. The trick of Jonson's method of achieving such fullness lies in his mastery of variations within limits: he makes the episode seem absolutely exhausting, completely degrading, massively thorough. His dramatic strategy is revealed in several ways. Although the cast of characters is small by Elizabethan standards (only fifteen speaking parts), there seems to be a terrible crowd, chiefly because the actors come onstage so frequently to say so much, and everyone is brought on together at least twice. When some- one is offstage, he still is the subject of conversa- tion, or he is just in the next room, or behind a curtain, or sitting in the attic, with a huge pile of nightcaps on his head to keep out the noise. Activity is constant, noisemaking actions, musi- cians playing, drinking games, brawling, a mock duel, a learned disputation over ancient and modern authors, and a legal inquiry. The full strength of Jonson's illusion lies, however, in the tissue of the plot. It progresses in a compact series, by ringing the changes, by turn and counterturn, creating the impression that all the possibilities are being wrung out of the scene. As the "lawyers" proceed with their syste- matic and remorseless enumeration of the twelve impediments to a marriage, Morose becomes less and less hopeful, until at the last he is at the end of his tether, willing to do anything. At the suggestion of Truewit, he debases himself before the entire assembled cast, willingly confessing his impotence: "I am no man, ladies," totally unable to do the office of a husband. A "bride- groom uncarnate!" shouts one of the ladies. But this does not end Morose's vexation, for now the ladies insist that they will inspect him, to verify his claims. Epicoene cuts that short by declaring she will take him as a husband with all his faults, and the lawyers agree in that case it is no divorce. Morose plunges into worse despair. For the counterturn, the two effeminate little men, Sir John Daw and Sir Amorous La Foole, are led to confess that they have had carnal knowledge of the bride, Epicoene; Morose exults again, he worships his deliverers and pays money to the men who supposedly cuckolded him. But he is crushed more completely by some legal techni- calities: the alleged intercourse had occurred be- fore marriage, and the bride had not sworn in the presence of witnesses that she was a virgin. Morose cries weakly, "0 my heart! wilt thou break? wilt thou break? this is the worst of all worst worsts! that hell could have devis'd! Marry a whore, and so much noise!" By now the variety of his vexation has reduced him to a mere reflex, a twitching puppet, an empty mechanism. He had started the play as something subhuman, afraid of life and vitality at its minimal level, but now he is just a bundle of afflictions. And so 13 Some of the following comments appeared in a briefer form in the introduction to my edition of Epicoene (Lincoln, Neb., 1966). 58</page><page sequence="9">L. A. Beaurline at the apparent end of the series, all he asks is the pleasure of dying in silence. Our expectations are fulfilled for the moment. But Morose's confession is the lever that Dau- phine has been waiting all along to pull; if Mo- rose will agree to such and such he can be de- livered; and a surprising, final, and complete counterturn occurs, with the unmasking of Epi- coene. Jonson seems to be milking the situation of far more than we ever dreamed it could contain. The most basic premise on which everyone had been proceeding, that Epicoene is a woman, is shown to be false. Everyone, except the three wits, is struck speechless-an important de- velopment in a play about noise. Herford and Simpson objected that this sur- prise ending is a mistake because the audience has not been taken into the author's confidence; consequently some of the fine ironies in earlier speeches are lost. On the contrary, I believe that Jonson boldly violates that elementary dra- matic principle in order to achieve more striking effects and a more thorough exploitation of dra- matic possibilities. His theme, as Edward Par- tridge has observed, is hermaphrodism, trans- vestism, signifying unmanly and unwomanly behavior; and in ringing the changes on this theme almost every satirized character loses or distorts his sexuality. The collegiates live away from their husbands, pretend to learning, "cry down or up what they like or dislike in a brain or a fashion with most masculine or rather herma- phroditicall authority," and they call each other by their last names as men do. La Foole is a "precious mannikin," a "wind fucker" who claims great intimacy with the ladies, and who suffers in Act iv a ritual castration. Daw, who also serves Epicoene, is a "mere talking mole [a moon cow or monstrous birth], a fellow so utterly nothing as he knows not what he would be." Otter, an amphibian, that is, of indetermi- nate sex), "is his wife's subject; he calls her princess." Mrs. Otter, a Gorgon's head, an Amazon, is a sexless machine who "takes herself asunder still when she goes to bed, into some twenty boxes and about next day noon is put together again like a great German clock." The whole group, consequently, prefigures the true identity of Epicoene; they massively and ex- haustively suggest the various changes that Epicoene undergoes. At first she is an unnatu- rally silent women, who having married a misog- ynist is transformed into the other extreme of monsterhood, a jabbering woman, a collegiate lady. Her reputation is sullied with tales of promiscuity making her a "lady of Whitefriars" (that is, a whore): and finally when she has most fully created the illusion of an aggressive woman, a mannish creature, a very hermaphrodite- Jonson suddenly reveals that the illusion is the reality. Or more precisely, theatrical necessity is metamorphosed into dramatic life: the game is earnest. It is the most suitable kind of coup de theatre, like bringing the statue to life in The Winter's Tale, Act v. And the use of a boy actor for the part adds a special charm. By an almost infinite series of turns and counterturns he exhausts the possibilities of sexual variety and builds them into the climax. For the Jacobean audience, then, there was an additional twist; they could hardly have missed the fact that a boy was playing the part, but they had, no doubt, accepted the convention of a "squeaking Cleopatra boying her greatness" on the stage. This convention is taken up into the plot in a most ingenious fashion, toyed with, manipulated, and tossed back into the laps of the astonished audience. We might imagine that the use of boys to play women's parts was a crippling limitation on dramatic invention and the boy disguised as a girl a rather shopworn device by 1609, but Jonson turned it into an opportunity to explore intensely the limited dramatic possi- bilities. Such is the esthetic of completeness, to create the illusion of fullness or plenitude within arbitrary limits set on the material. Only within set limits can the potential be discovered. The satiric edge on this method would have been appreciated by Jonson's more perceptive critics, for the audience is encouraged through- out the final scenes to adopt a superior, de- tached point of view and to laugh at the wits as well as at the dupes. We ridicule the bad Latin of the lawyers Cutbeard and Otter; the ladies are completely exposed by the ruse; and ulti- mately we laugh at Truewit, Clerimont, and Dauphine because they have cared to play such a game in the first place. Thus there is a hint that the vexation, the copious speech, the vari- ety of affliction, and the sport have become the object of comedy. Truewit has taste enough to resign the garland of wit at the end, perhaps be- cause it was not worth winning. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA Charlottesville 59</page></plain_text>
