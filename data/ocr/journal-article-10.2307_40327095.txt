<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sacred Music in the Classroom: A Pluralistic View Austin Caswell Indiana University The musicology I &gt;yas taught in graduate school conformed to a number of canons: foremost among them were 1) the conviction of the superiority of European Art Music, 2) an accepted list of "Great Works"~and their "Great Composers"~manifesting that superiori- ty, 3) the requisite tools for studying those works and composers, and 4) the belief in the intellectual and moral superiority achieved by ingesting those works and developing a sensi- tivity for them. But as we see this cosmos shrinking all around us, either being dethroned or making room for other paradigms of the study of music, we are faced with this dilemma: wanting to teach our students a variety of musics, how do we do it? We may know so little about non-European musics as to be unable to approach them. I propose that a successful rescue can be afforded by looking at the very shift in music study that causes the original dilemma. The shift is not merely to new and unfamiliar musi- cs, but also to new and unfamiliar epistemolog- ies- new ways of thinking about music- ways borrowed in many cases from other disciplines- in my discipline, borrowed from ethnomusicolo- gy. This borrowing asks us to set aside our focus on greatness as well as our concern for the structures of music as found in its notation, and look at music contextually to find out what it does for its culture-its performers, its listen- ers; to search for music's cultural meaning, to use a loaded cliché. In this essay, I will present a very personal exploration of how I am led to deal with this challenge in a particular musical arena- that of sacred choral music, focusing on the Anglican church music of my youth and the very differ- ent church music of Afro-American culture. One half of this focus- Anglican choral music- is no stranger to academic music curricula; for generations we have studied the choral music of liturgical Christianity. But our academic tradi- tion has assumed that its content was to be found by studying its notation; it is our unfamil- iarity with ways of looking at liturgical music as socio-religious behavior that prevents us from getting out of our methodological rut just as much as the lack of notation stymies our study of the music of the black church. Per- haps the unpacking of the meanings and modal- ities of these two ways of worshipping will allow us to study both musical traditions and afford us better insights into both. I can't remember when I wasn't a church musician. At the age of seven I was initiated into the mysteries of the Anglican boy choir whose vestments, incense, and ritual movements (processions, bowing, genuflecting) became for me the paradigm of worship. Elizabethan choral music was for me the way one addressed God. I wasn't so parochial as to assume all religions performed the same rituals or sang the same music as we did, but I did believe all religions observed worship distinctions like mine, segregating rituals into the polar catego- Philosophy of Music Education Review 3, no. 2 (Fall 1995): 83-90.</page><page sequence="2">84 Philosophy of Music Education Review ríes of high (priestly) and low (populist)40 and that all sacred arts could be mastered by ratio- nal instruction. In my case, this instruction involved a year's apprenticeship in a choir school that trained me rigorously before I was allowed to enter the sanctuary as a leader of musical worship; I learned there was a right way to perform each genre of ritual and that mistakes were offensive to God. There was a right way to genuflect, to cross myself, to stand while singing, to kneel at prayer, to pronounce the sung and the spoken language, even a right way to breathe. All of us in the choir loved it; we were leading the adult congregation through a mystery whose movements and texts came alive via our agency; we were a priesthood entrusted with a job no one else-neither peers nor parents-could do; we were special, we were chosen. You can imagine my disorientation when, years later, I encountered Afro- American musi- cal worship.41 Gone was the separation of priest from people, gone was the discrete border around each ritual act and musical genre; all forms seemed fluid, everything merged and emerged spontaneously, all utterance affective process rather than art object. I was puzzled by the apparent lack of genre hierarchies; each part of the service seemed as important as every other since most elicited the same response- group ecstacy. There seemed no hierarchy of persons; the preacher and the musicians leading the service seemed undifferentiated in role and rank from those in the congregation 42~indeed, members of the congregation were expected to testify through transcendent speech and/or ecstatic dance ("shouting"). I was baffled as well by the merging of modes: the line between prose and poetry was fluid, the distinction between priest and congregation was unclear, and even the separation between speech and song often disappeared.43 Most disorienting of all was the merging of sacred and secular; the music of black worship sounded the same as that heard in secular contexts, and seemed driven by the same aesthetic in both.44 I gradually concluded that black worship is different not just in shape, content, and cultural lineage, but also in theology. This paper will investigate these differences in an attempt to provide a basis for studying these two musics in a fashion that does not give primacy of methodology to either. Let me begin by reflecting on the compari- sons made above. In my boyhood experience, my choir performed as a collective musical priest-representing the congregation, but ex- cluding them from musical participation. The choir's music was seen as a discrete art object having definable dimensions- compositional form, musical notation, texts canonically dictat- ed by calendar and ritual function- adhered to as a requirement of the success of the sacred ritual. It was clear to us as musical priests that if our elements of the service were mishandled in any way God would not be adequately ad- dressed. Black worship is different in all these respects; the choir may not be separated from the congregation; when it is, the choir does not act for a silent congregation, but acts with them, urging and leading the congregational utterance essential to black worship. The music is not a fixed art object with parameters governed by a canon of performance codes, but rather a shared experience of indeterminate form and length evaluated by standards other than those of pitch, rhythm, tempo, and timbre. Outcry and bodily movement- expressions excluded from my choir's performance- are essential to black worship, their presence signaling successful communication; i.e., worshippers becoming one with the Holy Spirit and rejoicing in its influ- ence on their lives. In my Anglican experience the priest's sermon was an address to the congregation by a person clearly separated from them by train- ing (a graduate degree in theology) and profes- sional dedication. Thus the listening congrega- tion expected to receive from the sermon things they were incapable of providing for them- selves-instruction, scholarship, and priestly</page><page sequence="3">Austin Caswell 85 insight-and to do so silently and attentively. The Afro-American preacher's position, func- tion, and activity are different; the preacher and the congregation are in a sense one, each urging the other toward higher levels of spirituality, but neither exclusively source or recipient. The preacher is a person with superior powers of exhortation, but not necessarily superior educa- tion. The members of the congregation share the preacher's powers: the power to raise them- selves, the preacher, and the message to a higher plane by their joint utterance. In a sense, the preacher and the congregation fuse to become more than speakers of the word-they become the word itself, a message not depen- dent upon language. The members who give testimony or "shout" exemplify this transforma- tion; they are not offering exegesis of the Word, but are manifesting that they have become the living word, speaking-often in "tongues"~and dancing in the control not of themselves but of the Holy Spirit.45 The congregation does not depend on the preacher to give it things they lack; the preacher, instead, forges the cohesion essential for the group to articulate messages already inherent in them.46 In my Anglican experience, speech was clearly separated from song by sound, usage, and jointure; the division between the two genres was never blurred. The black preacher, on the other hand, moves between speech and song so frequently and imperceptibly any demarcation between modalities becomes mean- ingless.47 And it is not a crossover always dependent upon the preacher; the church's instrumentalists will frequently transform the preacher's speech into music by punctuating it instrumentally; the congregation does the same with its voices and bodies. The preacher and the instrumentalists lead the congregation on the journey of spiritual possession; in this capacity they are expected to maintain rational control over the process-not to surrender total control to the spirit. In this sense they are a separated priesthood.48 Differences of role and process can be cited at length, and most Americans, white and black, can use their own observations to fill out a complete picture. But my purpose is not to draw musical and ritual contrasts for their own sake, nor to analyze the differing cultures. My purpose is to search for the differences of theology behind these two modalities of wor- ship. In doing so, I will shift from a dialectic that has been primarily ernie to one that is more etic in nature; e.g. I will set aside my personal explanations of experience and take up the role of the outside analyst.49 At the risk of oversimplifying, let me propose that the two religious practices have different aesthetic bases. The Anglican service of my childhood believes its component sacred objects are to be treated with the care accorded objects of high art. To be sure, these objects are not enclosed in the glass cases of art muse- ums, nor are they watched over by uniformed guards. But they are still given museum-like respect; the worshipper as well as the officiat- ing priest displays them in the required mode and in the correct places in the service, taking care not to alter their shapes nor interpolate other objects into their presentation. The musi- cal priesthood (the choir) is expected to present the correct art-objects, and also to exercise their priestly skills to ensure that their presentations resonate with the sacred. The black worship experience, on the other hand, has as its aesthetic the mutual elevation of the entire group into contact with the divine. Its aim is to achieve group tran- scendence: the state in which we leave-even if temporarily and partially-the bounds of earth and quotidian life to make tangible our relation- ship with God.50 Preacher, choir, instrumen- talists, and congregation succeed at worship by the degree to which they manifest this mystic state. When the preacher breaks into song or glossolalia it is seen not as a shift of genres, but as a manifestation of spiritual possession- contact with God. When the congregation, choir, and instrumentalists join the preacher they are not interrupting her or his presentation, but helping her or him-and each other-experi-</page><page sequence="4">86 Philosophy of Music Education Review enee spiritual possession.51 This difference in aesthetic suggests a much greater difference- that the God of black religion is definably different that the God of my Anglican child- hood. My childhood God was invisible, distant, . and not engaged in verbal dialogue with me, while the black church has a God visibly hu- man, omnipresent, and inherent in the wor- shipper both bodily and verbally. It seems to me these differences involve different epistemologies as well. A hint at the differences lies in the way the young would-be participant is accepted into the processes of worship. As a child I went through a year-long training to inculcate me with the correct proce- dures; my African-American friends tell me they are introduced to musical worship differ- ently. First, and perhaps most important, in black worship there is little selection or segre- gation of musician from non-musician; all are assumed able to worship in all modes and are welcomed in all. Even the designation of choir- member by separate placement (if any such separation is made) is not so much a matter of ability and training as one of interest. More revealing is that black children are expected to participate musically in worship in whatever way they choose, a participation not dependant on professionally evaluated musical accomplish- ment. Even if the child has only a beginner's acquaintance with an instrument, that level is welcomed because it can contribute to the congregation's elevation. The difference of worship's goal is, how- ever, the key to the differences between the two traditions. In my Anglican tradition the goal of worship was to perform the ritual work so as to present to God a "pure offering:" sacred objects re-created to live again as they have lived for generations. This Anglican sacred object is logocentric and narrative.52 In the Anglican service one views the divine by reasoning one's way along a prescribed verbal path, not by transport of the soul through song, dance, or "shout." Not only is the word the essence of the divine as well as the means of its percep- tion, but it is a message sent from a sacrally authoritative past time. The words of Anglican ritual of my youth came from sacrally ancient sources- the King James Bible (1611) and the Book of Common Prayer (1662); music from the sixteenth century or in more recent styles imitative thereof. Anglican worship becomes, then, a return in time to touch an original logos, a circular process that establishes the validity of the worship itself. The antiquity of its genres validates their psychology and allows the Angli- can worshipper to consider such expressions venerable. John Donne's religious transport is valid in Anglican worship-the worshipper's transport is suspect. In black worship the aim is different. It is governed not by curatorial care for an artistic heritage; it aims, rather, at effecting an escape from the present world-a world seen as oppres- sive and unfixable-and at experiencing the ecstasy of the escape. It certainly invests no authority in nor affection for an earlier era of black culture. It works not by the articulation of a logocentric art object, but by an inundation of sensory messages- an accumulation of stimu- lae calculated to engulf the worshipper and make her or him part of the celebrating body of the faithful by the motive energy of the group. This state is arrived at not by reasoned consid- eration, but by a possession whose media are song and manifest response to the preacher's exhortations through dance, prayer, shout, song, inter alia.53 Black worship rejects the primacy of the word in favor of a sensual embrace that con- vinces the worshipper of a truth not posited in words. The concern over whether words, movements, and music are appropriate to sacred use-an issue of wide-spread concern in white Christianity-does not occur in the black church to the same extent. In black church music, for instance, the use of instruments (guitar, drum set, vibes, saxophone, synthesized keyboard) and musical styles associated with secular music is not seen as corruptive. Such tech- niques are not seen as "borrowed" since they are not recognized as the sole property of any</page><page sequence="5">Austin Caswell 87 sector of life.54 How do the black worshipper, preacher, and musician learn their skills. In my Anglican experience, academia's badge of accomplish- ment was the paradigm not for the clergy and musician alone, but for the worshipper as well. The black preacher, musician, and worshipper, on the other hand, learn skills by a different path. Since the aim of black religious practice is to leave this earth to embrace the divine, its epistemological concern is the acquisition of skills that work toward that goal. Instead of relying on a logocentric canon mastered in academia, the black Christian acquires skills by observation, participation, trial, and error: whatever works is kept- whatever doesn't is dropped-an epistemology revealing a close connection to the empiricism of black life, black culture does not recognize a separation of the intellectual from the spiritual. It does not conceive of life as separated into mutually exclusive categories of intellect and emotion, thus it feels no need to embrace the rational and hold the sensual at arm's length as did my Anglican training. This empirical unity has long appealed to Anglicans- and others- dis- turbed by what they see as their psychological schizophrenia.55 The black worship experience is not the transmission of the same message as that of my childhood by more theatrical means, black theology itself is different; it believes the reli- gious experience transcends the verbal and thus embraces a multi-sensory world. It believes the transportive experience to be more profound than the logocentric one since ecstacy engages the complete organism in a holistic way not available to the rational isolation required by logocentric worship. It asserts that the worship- per's experience of liberation from sin through dance, song, weeping, shouting, and even collapse are not merely more affective, but constitute a different theology. Frank Burch Brown, in his study of the aesthetics of reli- gious practice, supports my assertion, holding that ". . . we need not regard such singing merely as an outward expression of something 'more important', such as belief . . . Unlike the religious purist, we feel no necessity to treat [it] as just a token or illustration of genuine devo- tion. While religious singing and seeing always exist in relation to other dimensions of religion, they too really are part of religion, and poten- tially as much of religion as anything else is."56 Brown also helps us see further into religious practice as a way of being. He pres- ents four kinds of religious transcendence, two of which are applicable here.57 The first, radi- cal transcendence, he describes thus: For that branch of Reformation piety and theology known as the Reformed, it seems the case that religious awareness ... is most often confronted by a God of Unlikeness before whom one stands struck if not by awe, then by a sense of the incapacity of anything finite to bear or contain the infinite . . . God's infinite goodness ... is deemed quite unapproa- chable from our side. Yet when a radically transcendent God wills to be encountered, it will come to pass . . . God is able to make use of aesthetic forms, among others, to mediate or prepare for divine self-disclo- sure . . . The Holy Spirit is seen, in short, as a transcendently magnificent poet.58 Brown characterizes the art of this theo- logical stance as having "the capacity ultimately to reveal its own incapacity, thus potentially functioning- paradoxically- as a vehicle of religious receptivity."59 Brown holds up the mirror to my Anglican experience and puts the image in words I have never been able to come up with on my own. But he also makes me see that my childhood experience also partook of another kind of transcendence, One proximate, or 'near' presence of God as manifested in . . . bells and incense, gestures and pro- cessions, poetic or ... archaic language, vocal and instrumental music, and often impressive architecture. Even if many</page><page sequence="6">88 Philosophy of Music Education Review of these aesthetica never draw attention to themselves individually, they collec- tively and cumulatively create a rich sensory and imaginative milieu that con- tributes to one's awareness of sacramen- tal presene . . . God must be very great and awe-inspiring to warrant such ex- traordinary art and ceremony; one there- fore is humbled in God's [near] pres- ence.60 As choirboys we were given to understand these things by putting them into practice; had we been told in them in Brown's words, we would have understood him exactly. But Brown posits that black Christianity also partakes of a proximate transcendence, one that knows that the proximate can become tangible if the congregation wills it: Preaching itself becomes a venture into territory not entirely charted ahead of time even by the Good Book. Frequent- ly improvisatory, it is marked by striking and often colloquial images, vivid narra- tives, powerful cadences, and a tone charged with emotion. The God cele- brated in this religious aesthetic is the One who liberates and saves, delivering Daniel from the fiery furnace, Israel from Egypt's land, and prayer and praise from the shackles of rigid propriety. . . . [Tjhe transcendent God expe- rienced in this tradition is usually not just proximate but also participative and quite anthropomorphic: jubilant, angry, passionate, tender. It is fitting, there- fore, that here the differences separating sacred style from secular can be narrow indeed, with God's love and the love shown to God both seeming close to human love in general.61 But when the black congregation, preacher, and musicians are successful in making the proxi- mate tangible, the entire body of worshipers may be infused by God's presence and tempo- rarily embody what Brown terms immanent transcendence, experiencing God "... not as a reality near or present to us but as the extraordi- nary and miraculous reality ever present and immanent in us and in all other things . . . '*2 This is clearly what happens when the preacher leaves syntactical language and enters the world of glossolalia, when the musician improvises beyond what he or she has been trained or accustomed to do, and when the congregation leaves normal modes of behavior and demon- strates "possession" by the divine. Many hold that the proximate/immanent transcendence of black worship is born of the necessity to immerse the believer in a cleansing and restorative experience that re-arms her/him for the daily confrontation with a hostile white culture-a confrontation that depletes her/him of the ability to cope.63 While this is certainly an important function of the worship process, it refers to conditions outside black culture and thus, cannot explain why black culture chooses to address these conditions as it does. Why does black worship cope with a hostile world by ecstacy, possession, dance: immanent mani- festations of believer become belief? I am con- vinced it is because black culture will not accept, indeed views as contrived, any mecha- nism that separates the intellect from the rest of the human organism- it believes that convic- tions are best expressed in human manifesta- tions rather than in verbal formulations.64 Where have I gone and where have I come to? I am convinced that we can do more justice to the study of sacred music of these two cul- tures if we stand on the common epistemologi- cal ground of how they work as religious utter- ance than we can by looking at them as two forms of music- one approachable by the study of notation and the other by the study of impro- visation. That my conviction depends not on exploration of musical parameters but on the embrace of cultural and anthropological- one may say ethnomusicological- ways of thinking fits with directions I see my field currently pursuing. I feel these directions hold no dan- gers for us.</page><page sequence="7">Austin Caswell 89 NOTES 1 .

At the risk of Philistinism I will generalize about worship in black culture rather than making distinc- tions between the worship cultures of Pentecostals, Baptists, Methodists, inter alia. While the differ- ences are many, the similarities are greater. 3. The experienced black worshipper knows the black preacher is clearly distinguished from the other members in role and skill. To an Anglican, howev- er, the fact that the preacher may not wear special clothing, have professional training, nor lead a separated professional life may obscure other dis- tinctions. 4. A particularly lucid observation of the rhetorical structures of black worship is found in Brett Sutton, "Speech, Chant, and Song: Patterns of Language and Action in a Southern Church," Diversities of Gifts, eds. Ruel W. Tyson, Jr., James L. Peacock, and Daniel W. Patterson (Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 157-176. Sutton gently warns, "To the visitor unaccustomed to the tradition, the typical meeting has the appearance of a disorderly, even chaotic mixture of words and actions, but the sense of disorder is more apparent than real. Under closer scrutiny, patterns emerge; these various forms become components of a single expressive order..." 159. 5. Once again, appearance is deceiving. The apparent similarity of aesthetic is because American popular music has borrowed massively from black culture and has incorporated the gestures of black religious practice although, most would concur, without its goal or aesthetic. 6. In chapter 8 ("Isochronisms of Antistructure") of his Protest and Praise: Sacred Music of Black Religion, (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1990), Jon M. Spencer gives an analysis of the rhetoric of black Pentecostal witnessing and "shouting" that goes well beyond the usual structural analysis to speak of religious address in terms of a ritual of psychological restora- tion necessary to restore the believer to a degree of health and integrity that will enable him/her to cope with a hostile world. Irving I. Zaretsky and Mark P. Leone call religious trance "... a way to resanc- tify experience when it becomes banal and mean- ingless" in Religious Movements in Contemporary America (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1974), 224. 7. I must avoid implying the black preacher is no different than any member of the congregation. This is certainly not the case; the black preacher must be a facilitator of great skill, one who can create the group cohesion for the spiritual journey that is black worship. It is still true, however, that the black preacher can be anyone able to do the job- -professional training is seldom a requirement. The congregation's consciousness of this election is particularly strong since academic pedigree is not a part of a preacher's qualifications. 8. An excellent essay analyzing black preaching according to the models used by Milman Parry and Albert B. Lord to analyze the performance of Yugoslav epics is found in Bruce A. Rosenberg's "The Psychology of the Spiritual Sermon," Reli- gious Movements in Contemporary America, eds. Zaretsky and Leone, 135-149. 9. Perhaps the qualification of a black preacher is the ability to surrender to the Holy Spirit while at the same time maintaining rational control over the congregation's collective journey. Or perhaps one should say the Holy Spirit gives the preacher the ability to do these two antithetical things at once. 10. These two terms, originating in ethnomusicology, have been extensively borrowed by musicology. A good explanation of them can be found in Bruno Netti 's The Study of Ethnomusicology: Twenty-nine Issues and Concepts (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1983). 11. Mellonee Burnim speaks of these phenomena as "transformation" in her "The Performance of Black Gospel Music as Transformation," Concilium: Religion in the Eighties, eds. Collins, Power, and Burnim, 52-61. 12. My colleague Chris Smith points out that black worship, being processual in its orientation, cannot be said to aim only at the goal of escape from the world; an equal part of its focus is on the process of possession itself. 13.

In such a context everything one does becomes an act of 'criticism';" people express their opinions by participating. 153</page></plain_text>
