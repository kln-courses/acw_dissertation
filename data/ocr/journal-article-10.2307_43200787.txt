Smith Concepts of Deity: A Brief Overview from Yahwist Writings to the Mormon Jehovah-Is-Jesus Doctrine The current Mormon doctrine that Jesus is Jehovah, the Hebrew God of the Old Testament, differs from Jewish and Christian theology, as well as from early Mormon concepts of Deity ar- ticulated by Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, Orson Pratt, John Taylor, and other early Mormon leaders. This unique Mormon doctrine set forth in 1916 by James Talmage with the endorsement of the LDS First Presidency, modifies the traditional Judeo-Christian conception of Jehovah as "God the Father of mankind," the Creator and one God of the universe. This paper will examine the evolution of concepts of Deity beginning with Jahwist writings in the Old Testament, through the growth of Hebrew monotheism and the Christian addition of a Son of God and Holy Ghost to form a trinity which, in turn, served as a basis for Mormon theological devel- opment from 1830 to 1916. Judaic Anthropomorphism and Greek Absolutes Concepts of Deity evolve slowly over thousands of years. The idea of God that is central to most Christian religions arose from an accommodation of absolutist Greek philosophies with the personal God of biblical Judaism. Early Hebrew conceptions of Deity were plural. The Old Testament tells of rival gods, among which Yahweh, the Hebrew designation for God, becomes dominant. (Yahweh's name was cor- rupted into Jehovah by modern transliteration; the King James Bible translators, following thirteenth-century Christian Hebraists, arbitrarily transferred the vowel points of "Adonai" [My Lord] to the sacred letters of God's name, "JHWH," to produce the term "Jehovah." Since "Jehovah" is more familiar in Christian writings and Mormon hymns than the original "Yahweh," I will use that term.) Eventually, Jehovah emerges as the only God; the others are relegated to the status of false gods. By the seventh century BCE, with the Great Prophets (Amos, Hosea, Isaiah, and Micah), Hebrew culture had arrived at complete monotheism.1 The Old Testament ultimately testifies of one God, referred to by various names: El, Elohim (plural of El), Jehovah (Yahweh), and Adonai. Elohim is a plural Hebrew term to mean one or many gods. It may apply to the gods of Israel's neighbors or to Israel's God. Jehovah is the personal name of Israel's God as revealed to Moses (Ex. 6:2-3). Jehovah is used in combination with, or as a synonym for, El or Elohim. The author of the second account of the creation in Genesis 2 combined the two names Jehovah- Elohim to "affirm that Jehovah is Elohim, the God of all times."2 Furthermore, El, or Elohim, was the preferred name for God in the Northern Kingdom of Israel and Jehovah (Yahweh) was the pre- ferred name in Judah, the Southern Kingdom. In the prophetic books, the Hebrew biblical editors sometimes substituted the term Adonai (Lord) for Jehovah out of respect for the divine name. In his Dialogite article, "Elohim and Jehovah in Mormonism and the Bible," Boyd Kirkland reports how these various terms for Deity are used in the Old Testament.3 The King James trans- lators translated Elohim and El as "God," Jehovah as "LORD" (all capital letters), and Adonai as "Lord" (with only the "L" capitalized).4 In his article, Kirkland presents passages from the King James Translation of the Old Testament, substituting these original Hebrew names for God back into the text to show that the Bible authors identify Elohim (or El) and Jehovah as the same God: George Smith, of San Francisco, California, is president of Signature Books.

He became jealous; he threw down thunderbolts, caused floods, famines, plagues, and infestations of locusts and snakes. On occasion, he punished human disobedience with a "terrible, swift sword." He also loved and cared for his people, especially those who were obedient to him. In the earliest Old Testa- ment writings, Jehovah expressed the gamut of human emotions, quite different in tone from the gentle rabbi of the New Testament who led his followers with parables of meekness and forgiveness. As the Hebrews wrestled with the problem of evil in a world ruled by a just God, their idea of God changed. Jehovah came to express only goodness- evil came from Satan. Originally, "satan" in Hebrew signified an advocate, a role in adversary court proceedings. Influenced by the dualism of good and evil in the contemporary Persian religions, when the Israelites were ruled by Persia from 539 to 330 BCE, Jehovah was seen as totally good; evil was attributed to Satan. This dualism was further developed in early Christianity.7 Like the ancient Hebrews, the early Greeks believed that there were many gods. The Greeks thought that their gods lived among humans and interfered with their lives. It was typical of primi- tive cultures to attribute life and death, drought and floods, famine and disease to the actions of the gods. (The term "acts of God" survives today in our legal language.) Ultimately, a separation was conceived between the world of the gods and that of humans. The Greek gods were relegated to the heavens, where they served as inspiration for art, architecture, and drama. In the fourth century BCE, the Greek philosopher Plato formulated absolutes of goodness, truth, and beauty. These were concepts of perfection- ideals which, like the circle, humans could emulate, but never achieve. We can try to draw circles, but only the idea of a circle is perfect. Here was another dualism- between the ideal and the material. Later, some early Christian writers such as Paul would see ideas as good, and the material, sensory world as evil (Romans, chapter 8). Just as Persian religious concepts influenced Judaic and Greek culture, Persian influence also can be found in early Christianity. The Christian church seems to reflect the cosmology and redemption myths of Gnosticism (a Persian cult) and the mystery cults of the dying and rising savior gods.8 Jewish apocalypticism and rabbinic theology were also reflected in the new Christian church. After years of subservience to other cultures, the uncomfortable dominance of the Roman Empire, and the social disorientation of first-century Palestine, people welcomed the end-of-the-world prophecies of the late Old Testament prophets. The Jewish rabbi, Jesus, also seemed to anticipate an imminent end to the world. Recall in Mark 9:1 where Jesus said: "There are some standing here who will not taste death before they see that the kingdom of God has come." Albert Schweitzer described Jesus as "a man aglow with expectations of the end of the world."9 When Jesus was crucified and the world had not yet ended, his followers adapted. The belief that Jesus was the Son, resurrected from the dead, inspired early Christians to seek converts, first among the Jews in Palestine and Syria, later among all peoples. From a small eschatological Jewish sect, Christianity grew rapidly to find a place in the expanding Roman Empire which allowed it to exert worldwide influence.10 In the year 70 CE, Rome destroyed Jerusalem and, with it, the Jerusalem Church of Jesus, led by Peter and James. This left Paul's branch of the church among the Greek-speaking Gentile com- munities. Paul represented Christianity without the peculiarly Jewish dietary laws and rites of cir- cumcision, which would probably have limited the new church's appeal outside the Jewish culture. Since Paul missionized broadly throughout the Greek-speaking world and the Old Testament had been translated into Greek (the Septuagint, 3rd Century BCE), Greek became the language of the New Testament, written in the centuries after Jesus.11 29</page><page sequence="3">Volume Seven 1987 Paul became a principal architect of Christian theology regarding the fall, original sin, and atonement through the blood of Jesus Christ. According to Paul, humans seem compelled to sin; helpless to save themselves. Jesus takes upon himself the sins of all. Paying the penalty for human sin through a vicarious suffering, Christ purchases eternal salvation for the sinner. Those who do not believe and accept Christ as their savior- indeed, the majority of humankind- are consigned eternally to hell and damnation (Romans, chapter 5). As Paul expressed this Christian doctrine of blood atonement, he was always careful to distinguish between God and Jesus. He consistently refers to the Father as God and to Jesus as Lord, and placed the Son in a subordinate role to God. During the next 300 years, Christian theologians would argue whether the Son is subordinate to the Father, or a god equal in stature. Some felt that the Hebrew legacy of monotheism was at stake- if Christianity had two gods, would the unity of the single Deity, Jehovah, be lost? The Arian heresy advocated subordinating Christ to God. Because Arius did not win the argument, he was a heretic. The winners became the orthodox. One second-century writer, Justin Martyr, referred to Jesus as the God of the Old Testament, perhaps a precursor to the Mormon Jehovah-is-Jesus doctrine. He was also denounced as a heretic. Another heresy, taught by Sabellius, was that the one God is manifested alternately as Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. In this "Modalistic" concept, God could take any mode or form. These questions were finally resolved by Athanasia in the Council of Nicea in 325 CE. The Nicean Creed articulated the doctrine of trinitarianism, which considered all the members of the Godhead equal and representing one God. Becoming incarnate in Jesus Christ, God assumed the sins of the world, paying the penalty for humanity's sins through vicarious suffering. This Christian doctrine of atonement for human depravity was articulated by Tertullian, Augustine, Luther, Calvin, and Jonathan Edwards. When a more liberal interpretation of Christian doctrine allowed individuals to influence their destiny with good works, both Luther and Calvin re- affirmed that a portion of humanity was predestined to eternal damnation. People are saved only by faith in God's mercy. No "good works"- nothing that people can do- would save them. The Calvinist view of depraved humanity predestined for God's eternal punishment defines one conception of Deity. Sterling M. McMurrin, professor of history and philosophy at the University of Utah, reflecting upon this somber definition of fate, has said: However much he has been celebrated with moral descriptions, the God of the fundamentalist is an arbitrary tyrant. He is sublime , majestic. . .inscrutable He has created a world that groans with pain and suffering, accepts the blood of his own son as payment for his mercy, and creates souls to burn in hell eternally. This picture evokes the idea of God as the angry father portrayed in the Old Testament; however, the doctrines of God's perfect foreknowledge and predestination seem to be derived from the Greek philosophy of timeless absolutes, including the idea of cosmic justice. Christian theology thus combines Greek ideas about absolute good and justice with the Judeo-Christian idea of a divine father. Saint Augustine placed the absolutes into the mind of God. He combined the personal with the timeless by teaching that God was the source of the absolutes. What were to the Greeks imper- sonal absolutes, became to the Christians the very nature and personality of the living God.12 From the early Christian fusion of Greek and Hebrew concepts of Deity, various permutations have developed. Catholic doctrine modified predestination and asserted that good works such as in- dulgences might affect human destiny. The Protestant Reformation reaffirmed Paul's doctrine that eternal damnation was scheduled for most people. Side by side in America, fundamentalist religious revivals accompanied the growth of uni- versalism- wherein all of humanity merited salvation- and deism- which rejected both the angry, jealous God of the Old Testament and the idea of a second deity, Christ. The Deists substituted a Creator who completed his grand design, then, like Newton's giant clock run by natural law, let it spin without involving himself in human affairs. Several of America's founding fathers were Deists, including Thomas Jefferson, who rejected biblical and current claims of visions and miracles as ir- rational magic; Jefferson published his own edition of the Gospels, which deleted all miracles and any reference to the divinity of Jesus.13 Biblical criticism had begun in earnest in the late nineteenth century with the German scholar, Julius Wellhausen. Evidence was found that several authors, rather than Moses, wrote the Torah (the first five books of the Old Testament) and that many of the teachings that had been attributed to Jesus were probably produced centuries after his death by New Testament authors.14 30</page><page sequence="4">John Whitmer Historical Association Journal Mormon Concepts of Deity It was in a climate of intensive religious activity, which included proselyting and debunking, that Joseph Smith began to preach the doctrines that became known as 4 'Mormon." In the first decades of the new Republic, only about 10 to 15 percent of Americans belonged to any formal church.15 Many held a core belief in Christianity; folk magic and spiritualism were prevalent. Claims of seeing God and Christ were common at that time.16 In 1816 in New Hampshire, Elias Smith published an account of his morning vision of ' 'God and the Lamb. ' ' In 1821 in Vermont, Benjamin Putnam wrote of the vision of Jesus he had when he was fourteen years old.17 In 1817, there was a religious revival in Palmyra, about which time Joseph Smith later wrote that "at about the age of twelve my mind became seriously imprest with regard to the all important concerns for the wellfare of my immortal Soul which led me to searching the scriptures."18 He later told of a vision of "The Father and The Son" in 1820, three years afterward. In 1830, when Joseph Smith founded the Church of Christ, his ideas of God resembled Trinitarian views prevalent within Christianity. Joseph Smith's earliest statements and scriptural writings described God as an absolute, infinite, perfect spiritual being, and viewed the Godhead in a formula similar to trinitarianism: "Father, Son and Holy Ghost which is one God" (II Nephi 31:21; Mormon 7:7 [LDS edition]). The Book of Mormon, however, also confuses the identities and roles of the Father and the Son. Like the Christian Modalist heresy of the second century, its accounts are of one God who is mani- fested either as the Father or as the Son. God takes the role of Jesus, then is again called God. We read that God "who was, and is from all eternity to all eternity, shall come down from heaven among the children of men. . .and he shall be called Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning" (Mosiah 3:5-8 [LDS]). Also, "God shall come down. . .and because he dwelleth in flesh he shall be called the Son of God, and having subjected the flesh to the will of the Father, being the Father and the Son" (Mosiah 15:1-5 [LDS]). This alternate manifestation left open future variants, including the unique LDS Jehovah-is-Jesus doctrine. In a second major theological expression, Joseph Smith began to further distinguish the Father from the Son. As in traditional Christianity, he referred to the Father as Jehovah, the God of the Old Testament. In his Lectures on Faith, presented in the Doctrine and Covenants in 1835, Joseph Smith defined the Godhead as consisting of two personages: the Father, a personage of spirit, and the Son, a personage of tabernacle. This was close to the Christian trinitarian concept of God being incarnate in Christ. Joseph Smith defined the Holy Ghost as the "mind" of the Father and the Son. Then, in his 1838 account of the "first vision," Joseph Smith introduced two separate, visibly distinct, deities: the Father and the Son. At about the same time, he was using the name Jehovah to refer to God the Father. In his 1836 dedicatory prayer at the Kirtland temple, he used Jehovah and God the Father interchangeably (LDS Doctrine and Covenants 109:4, 34, 42, 47, 56, 68). Sometimes the following section (110) is construed to justify the later Jehovah-is-Jesus doctrine. Joseph Smith describes a vision of Jesus (April 3, 1836) in which Jesus has eyes like "a flame of fire" and a voice "as the sound of the rushing of great waters, even the voice of Jehovah." We know this is a comparison between two separate identities not only because he precedes the phrase with the adverb "as, " but because in the previous section he identifies Jehovah with the Father. And, just as consistently, in 1842, Joseph Smith identified Jehovah as Elohim and as the father of Jesus Christ: "Oh Thou, who seest and knowest the hearts of all men- Thou eternal, omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent Jehovah- God- Thou Eloheim . . . let faith on the name of Thy Son Jesus Christ. . .be conferred upon him.19 It is important to note here that Joseph Smith, rather than identifying Jehovah as Jesus, or as the son of Elohim, repeatedly used Jehovah and Elohim interchangeably to refer to God the Father, just as those names are used in the Old Testament. During this second stage of Mormon theology, other leaders also used Jehovah as the name of God the Father. For example, an 1841 statement of belief in the official newspaper, Times and Seasons, reads: "We believe in God the Father, who is the great Jehovah and head of all things, and that Christ is the Son of God, co-eternal with the Father."20 A third, somewhat overlapping, expansion of Mormon theology occurred in the Nauvoo period of church history (1839 to 1844). In this period, Joseph Smith began to teach that there was a plurality of gods, that men could become gods, that God was once a human, that like other humans, he had a father, and that God and Jesus had bodies of flesh and bone- like humans, except without blood (LDS Doctrine and Covenants 130:22). 31</page><page sequence="5">Volume Seven 1987 The Book of Abraham, which Joseph Smith completed in 1842, began with a revision of the creation narratives from Genesis, using plural deities. As the Godhead became plural, Joseph Smith described the creation of the world under the direction of a council of creation gods, incorporating, in the fashion of a primitivist restoration, various Old Testament names. All of these ideas were summed up in Joseph Smith's renowned 1844 sermon, the King Follett Discourse.21 In this conception of the creation, Joseph Smith began to use the title Elohim as the name of the ' 'head god' ' who presided over the ' 'council of gods' ' at the creation of the world. The gods involved in the creation were designated in Joseph Smith's temple endowment ceremony as Elohim, Jehovah, and Michael.22 Michael was previously identified as Adam (LDS Doctrine and Covenants 27:11). For the first time, the Old Testament synonyms for God were split apart: Jehovah is now considered as a separate being from Elohim, although Joseph Smith does not say he is Jesus. Joseph Smith's en- dowment ceremony did not appear to include Jesus among the creation gods. Joseph Smith's death in 1844 interrupted his further elaboration of this new theology. In 1854, Brigham Young introduced a fourth definition of Mormon deities at a church general con- ference when he identified Adam as God the Father. He taught that the god Michael created the world under the direction of Elohim and Jehovah, Michael's superiors in the council of gods. Michael then descended from his immortal status to become Adam, the first man on earth. While Michael was on earth, Elohim presided as God, but, following his ' 'death," Adam or Michael returned to his immortal status and presided over Israel using both titles, Elohim and Jehovah. Brigham Young taught that Michael (or Adam) begat Jesus both spiritually and in the flesh. Speaking of Jesus, Brigham Young stated: "Who did beget him?. . .His Father; and his Father is our God, and the Father of our spirits, and he is the framer of the body, the God and father of Our Lord Jesus Christ. Who is he? He is Father Adam; Michael; the Ancient of Days."23 Using the name Jehovah for Adam, Brigham Young called him "Yahovah Michael," who carried out the behests of Elohim in the creation of the world.24 It is important to remember that Brigham Young never referred to Jehovah as Jesus. Other Mormon general authorities spoke of Jehovah as the Father, a separate person from Jesus, his son. John Taylor, LDS president from 1880 to 1887, clearly identified Jehovah as God the Father in several writings and in a hymn: As in the heavens they all agree The record's given there by three, . . . Jehovah , God the Father's one, Another His Eternal Son, The Spirit does with them agree, The witnesses in heaven are three. 26 In the last change of the Mormon concept of Deity, Jehovah was dissociated from his identity as the one god of the Old Testament and became redefined as Jesus, while Elohim, the synonymous He- brew term for God, was left with the title of God the Father. This new doctrine may have grown out of the confusion of deities in the Book of Mormon and ambiguous references to plural deities that came later. Although the Jehovah-is-Jesus concept was not made official doctrine until 1916, it began to appear much earlier. In 1871, Apostle George Q. Cannon asserted in the Juvenile Instructor that Jesus was "the Being who spoke to Moses in the wilderness and declared, 'I am that I am.' "26 In 1885, Apostle Franklin D. Richards stated that Jesus' pre-mortal name was Jehovah: We learn that our Savior was born of a woman, and He was named Jesus the Christ . His name when He was a spiritual being, during the first half of the existence of the earth, before He was made flesh and blood, was Jehovah He was the spirit Being that directed, governed, and gave the law on Mount Sinai, where Moses was permitted to see Him in part. 27 At this point, it should be noted that Jesus was identified only as the God who spoke to Moses; since Brigham Young had already established Adam as creator of the world, that title would be withheld from Jesus until later. As time went on, these multiple deities became more confusing. In 1889, President George Q. Can- non related his beliefs on the Adam-God and Jehovah-is-Jesus doctrines to his son, Abraham H. Cannon, who wrote in his diary: "He believes that Jesus Christ is Jehovah, and that Adam is His Father and our God."28 Apparently using some form of syllogistic reasoning (Adam is God; Jesus is God [Jehovah]; therefore, Adam is Jesus), some Latter-day Saints began to equate Jesus with Adam. In 1912, the 32</page><page sequence="6">John Whitmer Historical Association Journal Improvement Era , in reply to a question, stated that ≈• 'it is clear that Adam and Christ are two per- sons-not the same person."29 By 1915, the Adam-God doctrine had been largely abandoned and Jesus became identified, not only as the God who spoke to Moses, but also as the Creator. By commission of the LDS First Presi- dency, James E. Talmage wrote the book, Jesus the Christ , in which he asserted the position that remains LDS doctrine today: Jesus Christ was and is God the Creator, the God who revealed Himself to Adam , Enoch , and all the antediluvial patriarchs and prophets down to Noah ; the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob ; the God of Israel as a united people , and the God of Ephraim and Judah after the disruption of the Hebrew nation; the God who made himself known to the prophets from Moses to Malachi; the God of the old testament record; and the God of the Nephites. We affirm that Jesus Christ was and is Jehovah , the Eternal One. 30 By calling Jehovah "Jesus," Mormons are not referring to the traditional physical manifestation of a spiritual being, as conceived by many traditional Christians. Rather, they are replacing the tra- ditional Old Testament Deity with Jesus. After Jesus took Adam's briefly held role as the creator, some Mormons (Charles W. Penrose, John A. Widtsoe, Joseph Fielding Smith, Bruce R. McConkie) began to argue that the Adam-God doctrine had never been taught. This is reflected in the Saintspeak definition of the Adam-God doctrine: "A doctrine that was never taught in the Church, especially by Brigham Young."31 In 1916, Talmage wrote a statement published by the LDS Church as "A Doctrinal Exposition by the First Presidency and the Twelve" on "The Father and the Son." As the final development among alternative Godhead doctrines from Mormonismi past, this statement defined Jesus as Je- hovah, the Creator and God of Israel, and Elohim as his Father.32 The most complete explication of the Mormon Jehovah-is-Jesus doctrine is found in Boyd Kirk- land's article "Jehovah as the Father: The Development of the Mormon Jehovah Doctrine."33 1 am indebted to Kirkland for his research and organization of this material, and his counsel. The Judeo-Christian and Mormon concepts of Deity evolved from the ideas of many cultures. We have summarized an ancient tradition which took millennia to develop and which underwent radical re-formulation in recent times. The ancient Hebrews first worshiped many gods, eventually de- veloping a personal monotheism; the Persians affirmed a dualism of good and evil, and eschat- ological notions of dying and rising savior gods, resurrection, and a final judgment. The impersonal absolutes of the Greeks were assimilated into early Christianity. Early Christian writers struggled with the implications of introducing a second Deity. After several centuries, the trinitarian formula was reached which preserved Old Testament monotheism; there were three beings, but somehow one God. The Father was a spiritual being and the Son was God in the flesh. In the 1840s, when Joseph Smith described a plurality of gods, the synonymous Hebrew terms for God, Jehovah, and Elohim became separate deities. In 1854, Brigham Young defined Adam as God the creator and by the 1880s, George Q. Cannon and Franklin D. Richards had identified Jehovah, the God who spoke to Moses, as Jesus. The "paper trail" of Jewish, Christian, and finally Mormon writers would suggest that an under- standing of God does not appear to have come from any one complete and final revelation. Certainly, what Mormons apparently believed in 1830 about the nature of deity differs markedly from the Jehovah-is-Jesus doctrine articulated in 1916. NOTES 1. Edward M.
