For this reason it seems worth while to put on record such facts as could be gleaned from the native hunters who range over the little-known interior country between Hamilton Inlet and Ungava Bay. The following observations were obtained in the country of the Naskapi Indians, who are the most northeasterly representatives of the great Algonkian linguistic stock. Two groups occupy this region, the Barren Ground people who before coming to the coast some years ago lived on Indian House Lake, and the Davis Inlet band who now trade at that post although their immediate ancestors came from Northwest River. The two bands are closely united and very often live together. As a member of the Rawson-MacMillan Subarctic Expedition of the Field Museum, June, 1927, to September, 1928, the author had considerable contact with these people, and during the winter and early spring of 1928 he lived and travelled with the Davis Inlet band in the interior west of that post. Like all northern regions, Labrador is subject to periodic fluctuations in the abundance of animal life, and the winter of 1927-1928 marked a very low ebb in the numbers of all species, resident as well as migratory. The country was lifeless beyond description, and it was not at all unusual to travel fifty or sixty miles a day in the utterly uninhabited interior and not see a single bird or animal track, let alone any living creature. In spite of constant hunting, only two snowshoe rabbits and no arctic hares were killed by the Indians. Willow ptarmigan, rock ptarmigan, 1 JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY, YOL. 11, NO. 1</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY and spruce grouse were likewise very scarce, and the fur-bearers, as would be expected, were very rare. This lifelessness extended to the birds of prey, small birds of all sorts, squirrels and mice. Needless to say, the Indians were terribly pressed for food, and if several small herds of caribou had not been encountered, in addition to the trout secured in nets under the ice, many of these people would have starved to death. These periods of want are of frequent occurrence in Labrador, and the mortality from starvation among the Indians who live in the peninsula is still quite high. Formerly, when there were no trading stations and the the hostile Eskimo prevented access to the coast, their sufferings at such times were even more extreme. The barren ground caribou, called ah-tee-u,l is the most important animal in northern Labrador from the Indians' standpoint. Not only is the greater part of their life spent in pursuit of these animals, but among the northern bands their religion is largely based on the caribou god, who may give or withhold food for the people. The Naskapi say that the caribou herds have decreased very rapidly in the last ten to fifteen years. Prior to that time it was quite usual for them to kill a thousand or more deer with spears as they swam across Indian House Lake. The main caribou herd formerly appeared there in October moving from the north and east, crossed the lake, and passed on to the south and west. In May it came back up the east side of the George River moving to the northeast. According to Indian belief, there is a high mountain in the barren grounds of northeastern Labrador that is called the Caribou House, ah-tee-which-oo-ap, where the chief of all the deer lives. It is here they believe the caribou spend the summer. As a result of the slaughter in former days there are great heaps of deer bones around Indian House Lake which have been commented on by all travellers in the region. The caribou smelled these bones, the Indians say, and were offended, so that they returned to the Caribou House and told the caribou god, who directed the chief of the caribou to take them into his mountain. Since then the caribou god has refused to let the herd come south, and as a result the Indians have been starved out of their interior homes. To-day they are extremely careful in observing all the varied rites pertaining to the caribou, and thus hope to appease the anger of the god. 1 The Indian terms used are in the Davis Inlet band dialect which is intermedi- ate between that of the Barren Ground and the Northwest River peoples. The sounds are given according to English usage to aid the general reader. The Algonkian languages are difficult and can only be rendered accurately by the use of complex phonetic symbols. 2</page><page sequence="3">STRONG-MAMMALS OF THE LABRADOR INTERIOR The probable explanation of this interesting myth seems to lie either in the fact that the main herd in the north has ceased its annual southern migration or that it has been exterminated. Lucien M. Turner com- ments on the great slaughter of caribou in the Ungava district in 1882, but states that at that time their numbers did not seem to be decreas- ing.2 However, in 1905, Mrs. Hubbard noted the rapid decrease in the migrating herds due she believed to excessive killing and large forest fires.3 The complete cessation of this migration across Indian House Lake seems to have come about in 1916, when the Barren Ground people deserted the Indian House Lake region to go to the coast. The above rather indicates that the caribou have been killed off, but there are other factors to be considered. North and east of Indian House Lake is a tremendous stretch of barren grounds into which almost no one penetrates. The Indians can not live in this area because of the lack of trees, for they will not eat raw meat like the Eskimo and they use wood for nearly all their household and other equipment. Thus the true barren grounds are to them a very definite ecological barrier. The coastal Eskimo do not penetrate any very great distance inland on their hunting trips and are, moreover, so few in numbers since the occurrence of the influenza epidemic of 1918 that they can not have much effect on the region.4 As a result the caribou occupying this vast range must have been very little molested by man. The Moravian missionaries all say that for many years caribou have been exceedingly numerous to the west of the mission stations at Okak and Hebron, the Eskimo killing all they wanted only a short dis- tance from the coast. This was certainly the case in May, 1928, when I visited these stations. The people had an abundance of meat and reported many deer only a short distance inland. It remains a question how large these northern herds may be and whether they are actually a fringe of the great herd that formerly performed an annual southern migration. This interesting question might most effectively be settled by an airplane reconnaissance of the northeastern sector of Labrador. 2 Ethnology of the Ungava District Hudson Bay Territory, 11th Ann.

At present a few scattered herds of caribou, ranging in number from a few individuals to forty or fifty, are to be found in the barren tablelands west of the coast between Nain and Hopedale. These herds seem to come toward the coast in winter and to move back into the interior in summer, but there is no north and south migration so far as the Indians have noticed. Such herds furnish food for the Barren Ground and Davis Inlet bands to-day. During my stay with the Davis Inlet band from January to April, 1928, about forty caribou were killed. These included a few individuals near the coast and two entire herds, one of thirty-two and one of six animals, killed some eighty miles northwest of Davis Inlet. All of these were females or young males. The old stags tend to keep by themselves and are less easily killed than the others. Each adult female of the large herd killed on February 17 contained one embryo about six inches long. Five of the six females killed on March 31 each contained one almost hairless but fully formed embryo, about one and a half feet long; the sixth female was immature. According to the Indians these embryos would have been born in May, which appears to be the usual time for dropping the young. At that time the does often go into timbered or bushy river-valleys. Practically all caribou killed during the winter and spring had antlers of varying size. The younger males5 and the females do not lose their horns until April; they bud again in May and attain full size by August. The old stags on the other hand are said to lose their antlers in December and begin growing them in May. The velvet is loose in August and the antlers clean by the last of September. The rut takes place in October at which time the stags are very bold, but, according to the Indians, will not attack man. The caribou suffer greatly from the mosquitoes that swarm in the summer, and the Indians often find individual animals standing on high hills with their defenceless hindquarters turned toward the breeze while they attempt to keep the insects from their faces with 6 According to Ernest Thompson Seton the young males of the barren ground caribou (Rangifer arcticus) shed their horns a few weeks after the old males, while the young males of the woodland caribou (Rangifer caribou) carry theirs until spring (Lives of Game Animals, vol. 3, pp. 73, 103, 1927). However, after the first reference, Seton quotes Frank Russell as finding bulls with horns in March and April, 1894, near Coppermine River; observations which agree with those of Dr. R. M. Anderson. There thus seems to be no specific difference in this regard between barren ground and woodland caribou. 4</page><page sequence="5">STRONG-MAMMALS OF THE LABRADOR INTERIOR their fore legs. Such deer are not eaten, as the meat is infected by the swelling from mosquito bites. In winter the caribou travel slowly over the wind-blown barrens of the higher country. Occasionally in heavy snow they make a "yard" several hundred yards in diameter, in which a herd of ten or twelve may stay for several months. In hunting caribou the Indians go up on the barren plateaus and from high hills search for the animals or their tracks. When these are seen they are followed, often with dog sleds, until the game is fairly close at hand. Then the dogs are secured, and the men, keeping care- fully to leeward of the deer, creep as close as possible. One man fires at the farthest animal, whose fall tends to drive the other caribou toward the hunters. Each caribou that starts to lead the herd in succession is killed, and the deer, leaderless, are soon milling around in a circle, often doing so until all are killed. In summer the animals are stabbed with short deer spears from canoes while they are swimming across the lakes, or else are stalked much as in winter. The use of deer spears and snares, and the practice of driving the animals into a corral where they are clubbed, speared or shot with bow and arrow, are among the older aboriginal practices. Next to the caribou, the black bear, called by the Naskapi mesk-weh, is a very important food animal which is quite common in the timbered river valleys. In the spring and summer of 1927 four hunters of the Davis Inlet band killed fourteen black bears, which was considered a smaller number than usual. These animals emerge from hibernation late in April or early in May, at which time they are very fat, although this condition is soon changed.6 During the summer they are hunted along the river courses with rifles, but in winter, when the animals are comatose, they are often killed with a deer spear or knife. .Nearly every old summer camp of the Naskapi is marked by bears' skulls set on posts, for these Indians perform many rites to appease the spirit of this important animal. I could obtain no definite records of the so-called barren ground bear which Turner mentions as fairly common in a restricted part of the northeastern interior.7 The Indians have a term m6h-ta-shue for a brown bear, which in one of their legends is classed as fiercer than the black or white bear. When shown pictures of the various bear species they identified m6h-tah-shue with both the grizzly and the brown or 6 R. M. Anderson notes the same condition in the barren ground grizzly just after hibernation. See V.

The older people said that some sixty years ago three of these brown bears attacked some Indian women at Petiskapau Lake, but were all killed by a man with a muzzle loader. None of the informants saw the dead animals or their killer, but they had talked with the women. Petiskapau Lake is far south of the reputed range of the barren ground bear, and it seems probable that the animals referred to were representatives of the brown phase of the black bear (Euarctos americanus). Common tradition over most of North America has it that the brown or cinnamon phase of the black bear is more pugnacious than his normal kinsman. The verbal testimony acquired by Turner, Low, Wallace8 and others, provides rather strong grounds for the belief in a "barren ground grizzly" in northeastern Labrador, but nearly all these accounts seem originally to have come from Indian sources. Now the Naskapi are closely related to the Cree in language and culture and have evidently been much influenced by them. The Cree know the true grizzly of the barren grounds and call him mistaya.9 It is possible therefore that the Naskapi have carried over tales of this awe-inspiring animal and applied them to the cinnamon bear in Labrador.l? None of the livingDavis Inlet or Barren Ground people, who range from Ungava to Hamilton Inlet, have ever seen the animal they call m6h-tah-shue or any sign of him. Considering the vast gap between the known range of the true grizzly in the north central barren grounds and that of the reputed barren ground grizzly (Ursus richardsoni)" in Labrador, it seems logical to identify this barren ground bear of Labrador with a somewhat aberrant brown phase of the black bear (Euarctos americanus), at least until more conclusive evidence comes to light. The white or polar bear is called wah-puisk-weh, and is feared by the Indians equally because of his strangeness to them and his great strength. Some fifty years ago they say these animals were occasionally met with near Rigolet on Hamilton Inlet. Davis Inlet band informants had seen bear tracks, said to be a foot and a half long, in the snow some thirty miles up Flowers River west of Davis Inlet and occasionally on 8 Dillon Wallace, after making inquiries concerning this barren ground bear, came to the conclusion that it had been exterminated.

The animals are said to cross the country in Ungava, but none of the Indians talked with had actually seen them nor, so far as I could gather, did they wish to. When the caribou are abundant, many wolves are seen in the interior, but of late both animals have been scarce. During the winter of 1927 and 1928, no sign of wolves had been seen by any of the Indians with whom I talked. The general term for wolf is mdy-hee-gun, but three kinds are distinguished: The gray, the white and the black. Gray wolves are most common, often being seen in packs up to the number of ten. Occasionally black or white animals are seen in these packs. The white wolves are sometimes seen alone and are probably representatives of the Arctic wolf (Canis tundrarum).12 Through the activities of the fur trade the distribution of fur-bearing animals in Labrador is fairly well known. Three color phases of the red fox and two of the white fox occur here as elsewhere. The Indian name for fox is ma-tchee-sue, although each species and color phase has a descriptive name. These animals seem to be most common near the coast and are more often hunted than trapped by the Indians. In bad weather the hunter takes the animal's fresh trail and follows it steadily, perhaps all day, through the woods where the foxes retreat during windy snowy weather. Travelling easily on snowshoes, the hunter wears down the fox and eventually shoots him. The beaver, mib-kweh, has been killed on interior streams west of Hopedale, but is not known farther north. The fisher (Martes pennanti) is actually unknown to these people, although he figures in one of their myths as the constella- tion Ursa Major. The wolverene, kwee-whdtch-you, is very rare at present but is well known and greatly detested as a robber of traps and caches. In Nas- kapi mythology he plays a large and very libidinous role. No accounts of torturing this animal when captured, such as Turner describes, were secured.13 The otter, nit-sook; marten, wah-pis-tdn; mink, dh-tsuk-ash; and muskrat, oh-tchesk, are found throughout this region along the forested river valleys. The muskrat, according to the Indians, breeds twice a year, once in June and again in August. The Indians have only one name for weasel, me-tah-kwut, but they say there are three kinds in their territory, a large, an intermediate, and a very small weasel. The latter suggests the least weasel (Mustela rixosa) which has not been 12 Bangs, op. cit., p. 505. The black wolf is a color phase of the gray. 13 Lucien Turner, op. cit., p. 281. 7</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY recorded from northern Labrador. Several Indians who had been as far south as Seven Islands knew. the skunk, although it is not found farther north. It is an interesting commentary on both the similarity of widely separated Algonkian dialects, and the origin of the word Chicago, that every time I mentioned the name of that city the Indians were convulsed with laughter, because of its close approximation to shuh-ko6k-weh, their name for the skunk. Similarly the word Chicago is translated in the Sauk, Fox and Kickapoo languages as "place of the skunk."14 An animal, which would seem to be the woodchuck, was described by several Indians who had seen it near Northwest River post on Hamilton Inlet. This animal is said to be slightly larger than a muskrat and lives in a burrow, hibernating until March. The Indians called it wee-nhskw, and the local whites "la cole," which would seem to be a French-Canadian term. The porcupine, kok-weh, is an important food animal to the Barren Ground band, as it is quite abundant in the timbered regions from Nain to Voisey's Bay. South from Voisey's Bay to Hopedale it seems to be quite scarce in the interior river valleys, although the environment seems even more favorable than to the north. The red squirrel is fairly common especially near the coast and is called oh-phow-i-now-sik-i-sas; the flying squirrel was not known to any of my informants. The Davis Inlet band use the word ah-pook-a-sheesh as a generic term for mice. The white-footed mouse (Peromyscus) was the only species caught while I was with the Indians, for mice, which are said to be extremely numerous some years, were extremely scarce in 1927 and 1928. Their name for this species is kds-i-nas-kwdn-tit. From pictures by Louis Agassiz Fuertes they identified the lemming (Dicrostonyx) and the meadow mouse (Microtus) by the same name wit-szs-kwe.l5 The picture of the red-backed mouse (Clethrionomys) was likewise identified as c-pu-wish-ish, and that of the rufous tree mouse (Phenacomys) as an-i-suk-i-sash.l6 The latter is of course an erroneous identification, 14 Handbook of American Indians, Bull. 30, Bur. Amer. Ethnol., 1907, p. 258. 16 According to Dr. R. M. Anderson, the Eskimos of the Mackenzie district have the same name for the tundra vole (Microtus operarius) and the brown lem- ming (Lemmus trimucronatus) at all seasons, and for the collared, banded, or fork-clawed lemming (Dicrostonyx rubricatus) when in summer pelage. The latter when in the white winter coat is considered as a different species (quilan- miutaq) which is supposed to fall from the sky in snowstorms. Letter of Febru- ary 12, 1929. 16 This name is very similar to the latter part of the Indian term for red squirrel. 8</page><page sequence="9">STRONG-MAMMALS OF THE LABRADOR INTERIOR as the tree-dwelling mice (Phenacomys longicaudus group) are known only from the humid coast belt of northern California and Oregon where- as the two Ungava forms of Phenacomys (P. ungava ungava Merriam, and P. ungava crassus, Bangs), have been taken in an almost treeless area. The Indian name may refer to some other species that occasion- ally leaves the ground. The shrew (Sorex) was called tceen-is-t6o-yap- 6ok-a-dgish. A small bat that they occasionally see in the spring as far north as Davis Inlet they call oo-pow-ah-pook-a-dgish.17 As a rule the Indian has a very accurate knowledge concerning the life habits of the animals he hunts, which is in a separate category from the mythological concepts he may also weave about them. Certain non-mythical theories adhered to by the Davis Inlet people are there- fore rather surprising to the naturalist. According to native belief both sexes of the arctic hare, mis-ta wdh-push, and the snowshoe rabbit, min-dskw wdh-push, are capable of bearing young. They say that usually the females have their young in June and July but that this function is sometimes performed by the male rabbit. No informant questioned had ever found new-born rabbits in the nest, but they based their belief on the fact that several times male rabbits with developed mammary glands and milk secretions had been killed. The well known difficulty in determining the sex of rabbits may form the pseudo-logical basis for the native theory. Similarly, they say that the abnormal dwarf caribou called mah-tdkw ah-tee-hoos, which they have occasionally seen and killed, are carried by the male caribou for six years in a skin sack attached to the belly. Then they are dropped fully developed and accompany the herd. Unlike the larger animals, these dwarf caribou are said never to have botfly holes in the skin. Possibly more purely mythical and less rationally conceived is their belief in two kinds of huge otters said to live in certain large interior lakes. Two old men of the Davis Inlet band claimed to have seen one of these animals, called wen-tsuk-ah-mes-e-t6y-oh, in Seal Lake (on the Nauscaupee, not the Little Whale River drainage). The body was said to be blackish brown with white lower legs and feet, large ears, and the animal was of great size. It whistled whezu-u-u, on a low note, very much like the call of a quail, or so the Indians' rendition of the call sounded. This animal has not been seen for many years, but an old story tells of an Indian who killed the young of this species and was 17 Bangs, op. cit., p. 498, gives no record of bats north of Natashkwan and Lake Mistassini. 9</page><page sequence="10">JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY pursued by the mother otter who could swim under land as well as water. According to the story, she killed the man who destroyed her young, but his companion escaped to tell about it. The other mythical otter is called mis-in-tsuk, being about ten feet long and built almost exactly like a seal. It is said not to be dangerous unless attacked. One Davis Inlet man claims to have seen this animal in atcagon napeesh or Little Seal Lake (a short distance northeast of Seal Lake). Since harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) are fairly common in these lakes,l8 it seems probable that the Indians have combined the characteristics of seal and otter into this mythical conception. They have often killed seals there, but no one has ever killed one of these giant otters. The Naskapi tend to people the lonely and desolate reaches of the interior with many malevolent and supernatural beings, but all of these, with the above exceptions, are anthropomorphic in character.

NOTES ON SOME MAMMALS OF SOUTlHERN MATTO GROSSO, BRAZIL BY FREDERIC WALTER MILLER [Plates 1-2] The following notes relating to a number of the larger mammals of southern Matto Grosso were all made in a more or less restricted area lying on the west bank of the Upper Paraguay at an approximate latitude of 16? south. The area in question (see map), being bordered on the east by this river, extends westward to the frontier of Bolivia, and from the Rio Jauru on the north, to Lake Gaiba on the south. It is admit- tedly but a tiny portion of the mighty state of Matto Grosso, yet it is an area of kingly size, covering hundreds of square miles. This is Descal- vados, the property of a giant cattle company, of American and English ownership. Ranching has been carried on only in a comparatively limited section adjacent to the port of Descalvados, and the remainder lies, an unspoiled wilderness, with all the characteristic Matto Grossan fauna in striking abundance.
