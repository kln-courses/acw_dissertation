Kurland present new information about the social behavior of Hanu- man langurs (Presbytis entellus) at Mount Abu, India, and Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) at Ryo- zenyama, Japan, based on long-term field obser- vations of individually recognizable animals (1503 hours in five periods, 1971-1975 for Hrdy; and about 700 hours, 1972-1973, for Kurland). They also at- tempt to link monkey social behavior to natural selec- tion by interpreting their observations in terms of individual selfishness and "inclusive fitness" (W. D. Hamilton, J. Theoret. Biol. 7: 1-51, 1964), which is (Kurland, p. 10) "the selective effects (costs and ben- efits) on an individual's and its relatives' reproduc- tive success (Darwinian fitness), devalued by the rele- vant degrees of relatedness...." In so doing, Hrdy and Kurland advance novel solutions to such long- standing puzzles as how and why dominance hierar- chies are maintained and why suckling infants are snatched and mishandled by conspecific females. Whether or not their interpretations are accepted, enough information, ideas, and within- and between-species comparisons are included to provoke thought and discussion. Their presentations are en- hanced by straightforward, nontechnical writing, in- telligible tables and figures, chapter summaries, synoptic bibliographies, appendixes, and indexes (Hrdy). Of the two books, Hrdy's is the more controversial for several reasons. First, her style is unabashedly anthropomorphic. For example, on a single page (p. 85) we find descriptions of "heroic ... old females" playing "daring roles" in defending a "baby" against an "undeterrably infanticidal male." Second, Hrdy attempts to interpret every langur behavior as "adap- tive," whether it occurs commonly or rarely, and re- gardless of whether it is probably occurring as a func- tion of human disturbance or in the context in which it likely evolved. She creates interesting, plausible evo- lutionary scenarios, but often does not present enough data to convince the reader, or even to per- suade us that such hypothesizing is warranted. Third,</page><page sequence="2">492 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY [VOLUME 53 contrary to conventional wisdom among pri- matologists (p. 6-11), Hrdy maintains (p. 2) that "Hanuman langurs in a variety of social, and antiso- cial, ways are unequivocally self-serving." Finally, Hrdy believes that individual reproductive selfishness leads inexorably to conflicts within and between the sexes and, most importantly (p. 2), that ". . . adult males routinely resolve their conflicting interests with females by killing the females' offspring." What is Hrdy's evidence? At Abu, female langurs live in groups of 4 to 11 adults, possibly kin, plus prepubescent young and a single male. Within groups, females fight for access to food and sleeping sites. Status or rank among females is determined less by size than by "reproductive value" (= "age") and "nepotism" (= "assisting kin") (Chapter 6). Between- group competition is even more intense, and home- range boundary disputes sometimes last all day (p. 103-105) and result in injuries. Females, especially nulliparas, often "steal" and then usually mistreat other mothers' young, suggesting (Chapter 7) that there is even an element of competition in learning to behave maternally. Males travel in unisexual bands and remain at the periphery of female groups. When propitious social circumstances arise, such as the absence or injury of the "harem male," peripheral males attempt to "usurp" the harem. If successful, the new male some- times attacks and wounds infants. Hrdy's hypothesis is (p. 247) that ". . . infant killing is part of a repro- ductive strategy whereby the usurping male increases his own reproductive success at the expense of the former leader (presumably the father of the infant killed), the mother, and her infant. As such, infan- ticide would be an extension of competition among males...." In support of her hypothesis, Hrdy pre- sents (1) numerous eyewitness accounts of attacks on infants by "usurping" males at Abu and a summary of similar observations by fieldworkers elsewhere in India (Chapter 8), and (2) correlations between infant disappearances and male troop takeovers in several P. entellus populations (p. 272-273) and in other harem-polygynous mammals (p. 244-247 and 287- 290). Hrdy also suggests (p. 281-287) that pregnant females may attempt to save their fetuses by feigning estrus and mating with "usurpers," thus presumably fooling them. The occurrence, however, of postcon- ception pseudoestrus among primates in which infan- ticide has not been reported (p. 284-285), seems to diminish the significance of this latter point. It is clear that male Hanuman langurs at Abu occa- sionally stalk, attack, and mortally wound infants after they enter a new troop (see also W. Angst and D. Thommen, Folia Primatol., 27: 198-229, 1977). Thus, Hrdy has documented a source of juvenile mortality previously only suspected, and developed an hypoth- esis to explain it. Less certain is whether infanticide is an evolved "reproductive strategy," and whether it alone accounts for the disappearance of about 50 per cent of all young born from 1971 to 1975 at Abu (between-troop range in infant disappearance was 0%-83%; p. 68). Hrdy's study site is a village where langurs live at unusually high densities (p. 31-35) and are continually harassed by humans and their house- hold pets (p. 63-64). Because Hrdy was absent from Abu for long periods and because she and her local informants witnessed only a fraction of the inferred "usurpations" and "infanticides," it is possible that the high rate of male, female, and infant disappearance she reported (p. 36-46) is related to human interfer- ence. Elsewhere in India and Nepal, Hanuman lan- gurs live at lower densities and apart from humans, but not natural predators; under these circumstances they form multi-male bands with little male-male an- tagonism (Chapter 3). Infanticide has never been ob- served in these populations and the incidence of in- fant disappearance is low (see R. A. Curtin, Kroeber Anthropol. Soc. Pap., 50: 27-36, 1977; R. Curtin and P. Dolhinow, Am. Sci., 66: 468-475, 1978). These points do not reduce the importance of Hrdy's observations but suggest that the accuracy of some of her interpre- tations awaits further research. Kurland's book is not as controversial, probably because its style is less anthropomorphic, its topic less emotion-charged, its data base more substantial, and its price so high. It opens with one of the clearest explanations of kinship theory available (Chapter 1). Then it turns to the behavior of a semi-wild group of 81 Japanese macaques that live at a "monkey park," an area where they congregate daily to be fed by tourists. This population has been observed since 1969 by Y. Sugiyama and coworkers, who provided Kurland with background information on demog- raphy and habits. Kurland's study attempts to test the prediction from "inclusive fitness" theory (p. 1) that ". . . altruistic acts increase and selfish acts decrease as the genetic relatedness between individuals in- creases." Unfortunately, Kurland's test is somewhat circular, for although "kin" were marked individ- ually, genealogical assignments of all animals born before 1968 and many born thereafter were based on "close association" behaviors (p. 39), the same behav- iors later used to study effects of "kinship" on "al- truism." Nonetheless, he presents the first informa- tion about how simultaneously observed (putative) near and distant macaque relatives treat each other. With a variety of sampling methods and statistical analyses (p. 46-49), Kurland shows that as putative relationship increases in M. fuscata, (1) time spent in proximity to or contact with relatives increases (p. 50-57), (2) allogrooming increases (p. 62-72), (3) likelihood of being defended against attack increases (p. 84-94), and (4) "awkward" handling of others' infants decreases (p. 108-113). Further, older females defend (p. 94-99) and groom (p. 62-67) younger kin more than vice versa, and mothers groom offspring,</page><page sequence="3">DECEMBER 1978] NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 493 especially sons, more than the reverse (p. 67-72). Kur- land concludes that gradual decreases in these "al- truistic" behaviors with decreasing genetic relation- ship supports Hamilton's hypothesis as a model for the elaboration of macaque sociality (see also A. Mas- sey,Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol., 2: 31-40, 1977). "However," he notes (p. 130), "without competing hypotheses (e.g., a nongenetic model), and without precise mea- surements of costs, benefits, and degrees of related- ness ... the conclusions must be somewhat guarded." This point is well taken, because the way Kurland assigned genealogies makes it impossible to separate his kinship hypothesis from the alternative that the true correlate of variations in "altruism" at Ryozenyama is difference in length or type of associa- tion. Only studies of known M. fuscata relatives in areas where they are not forced into unusual social groups by provisioning or otherwise interfered with by humans can decide this issue. Despite this reserva- tion, Kurland's book is "must" reading for those ques- tioning whether data appropriate for testing sociobiological hypotheses can be gathered and for those exploring patterns of cooperation and competi- tion among primates. Works like these two draw together anthropology, biology, and psychology, strongly suggest a link be- tween monkey behavior and natural selection, and illuminate new directions for field studies. I await such studies with enthusiasm. PAUL W. SHERMAN, Psychology and Museum of Ver- tebrate Zoology, University of California, Berkeley</page></plain_text>
