<plain_text><page sequence="1">A COMMUNICATION Reply to Mr. Wheelwright W5 THEN the editors informed me of their intention to publish in the VV fall issue, together with my "The New Naturalism," a criticism by Mr. Philip Wheelwright, I fell in with their plans gladly in the expectation that both readers and writer would profit by it. Since the days of The Symposium I have read Mr. Wheelwright to my advantage, and have respected him for what I believe to be a very rare combination of gifts in a professional philosopher. Who better qualified than he, I thought, to tell my readers and me where the new naturalism fails, and where - for that too would be of the greatest importance - it was at least oriented along directions which a man of his gifts considered to be the right ones? I must submit however - and because I am cramped for space must do so with a minimum of words -that I was deeply disappointed by Mr. Wheelwright's Reply. Am I as deaf as he makes me out? It may be that it is he who is blind. For how else can we account for his numerous misunderstandings in regard to fundamental aspects of the system of ideas on which I was reporting? And particularly, how else account for the most serious failure of his Reply, his systematic underrating of the point of view he was asked to evaluate? I took great pains to state with some emphasis that the new naturalism is not materialistic or reductionistic, and I even tried to explain the reasons why I do not think it is. But there is no need to read about the new naturalism, for if it is naturalism, Mr. Wheelwright says, it must be the same old "persistent fallacy that used to be called materialism." Of course Mr. Wheelwright grants that it isn't quite the same old fallacy the superior Europeans exiled. But the differences are only incidental differences of idiom. True, it has suffered a shift of emphasis from the category of substance to that of process, and on the way from Europe it jettisoned some of its metaphysical presuppositions. But if we believe my critic, nothing very important follows from that shift. Mr. Wheelwright says he gets from my piece the idea that I imagine</page><page sequence="2">92 KENYON REVIEW that it has been Russell, Carnap and Morris who first led the revolt against nonsense in philosophy. But the charge that metaphysicians "have been weaving the wind over unreal issues" was made long before these gentlemen; indeed long before Hume to whom it is usually traced. I must therefore be ignorant of elementary facts. Now since I am not on the required reading list, I cannot expect Mr. Wheelwright to be ac- quainted with the criticisms that I have expressed elsewhere in print on Russell and Carnap. But I do expect him to have read the piece he criticized. How could he have failed to notice that my estimate of the positivists is not as high as he imagines it is? And where in the essay do I base any of my arguments on "the semantic disciplines"? I said that my view intends to deny the belief of classical philosophers that the physicist or anyone else (including the metaphysician) has the key to reality "in the sense of disclosing to us its essential nature through his analysis. In this sense there is no key to reality; or if you prefer, there are as many keys as there are distinct disciplines." I italicize this sentence now because Mr. Wheelwright obviously missed it. Actual critical analysis of the knowledge enterprise as it is practised by all those who claim to have arrived at knowledge, will lead to the conclusion that none of the various attempts to get at knowledge in the various fields can be carried - as traditional philosophers have always thought they could carry their own efforts - beyond their frames of reference. In other words in deny- ing that any specific inquiry gives us an exclusive key to reality I accept wholeheartedly the contextualistic restrictions to which Mr. Wheelwright would like to confine knowledge. The very thing poets and religious men have tried to do in vain, namely to hold knowledge from gobbling up all of experience, is the thing the new naturalism has done. Mr. Wheelwright thinks this is what he wants to do. But it would seem that what is sauce for the physicist is not sauce for the meta-physicist. And it is this prejudice - for it is a mere prejudice - that blinds Mr. Wheelwright to the fact that we have anticipated his wish, and taken it more seriously than he himself does. But while we naturalists believe that it is extremely important to distinguish between knowledge and other modes of experience, we also believe that knowledge, wherever found and whatever its subject matter, employs the same methods of verification used by the exact scientist. This is why we call ourselves empiricists and believe in the unity of method. From our analysis we also conclude that the old naturalistic</page><page sequence="3">COMMUNICATION 93 denial of value to whole areas of human experience was unjustified. But that does not mean that these other modes of experience have a high cognitive validity; and if the claim is made by poet and prophet that they possess methods of verification different from the empirical, these gentle- men must be pitilessly shown up as muddlers. For in so far as these modes of experience can lay any claims to truth it is not difficult to show that the truth they embody is ordinary empirical truth, the only kind of truth there is. And clearly their truth content is low as compared with the exact sciences. Only philosophers prone to value knowledge as the highest value will argue that to deny that type of value to other modes of experience is to demean them. I suspect Mr. Wheelwright's antagonism to the doctrine of the unity of method has its source in the following contradiction: While he values mystery above all else he also values knowledge above any other mode of experience. A contradiction like that is easy for a philosopher to resolve. All he has to do is to assert that in a loose but deeper sense of the word knowledge, religion involves mystery as knowledge. From my shallow point of view, how can I gain- say him? On the other hand I could not be expected to discover what Mr. Wheelwright is talking about until he distinguishes the various things he includes in his loose use of the word knowledge: for he may include besides knowledge and pure aesthesis the love swoon of slithy toves for all I know. In the meantime I should confess an error, for I had always thought it was a philosopher's first duty to avoid loose talk and eliminate confusion. Until Mr. Wheelwright does, this I believe we may suspect: that in order to endow what he calls the religious experience with a value it does not preeminently have, the cognitive, Mr. Wheelwright is forced to fall back on desperate Tertullian makeshifts. I have no quarrel with Mr. Wheelwright because he loves mystery, though I myself should prefer clarity most of the time if I could get it. But I do object when he tries to palm off on me his favorite mode of experience- ecstasy through mystery - as involving the ultimate apprehension of the truth. I do not deny his experience has value, but that it has value as knowledge he has yet to prove to me. It is Mr. Wheelwright's failure to understand how the naturalist would liberate other modes of experience from the cognitive that prevents him from seeing anything more than confusion in my statement regarding the relative unimportance of exact science, which I made in passing on p. 446. I shall not make capital of the manner in which he disregarded</page><page sequence="4">94 KENYON REVIEW the qualification I clearly made in this respect when I spoke of "knowledge qua knowledge," and shall confine myself solely to the following sugges- tion: My statement is no more confused than if I had said that pure gold, which qua gold -that is to say from the standpoint of tests set up by the metallurgist - is better than a dental alloy, is not as good or impor- tant as are alloys from the standpoint of criteria set up by the dentist. Mr. Wheelwright does not seem to me to have fully grasped the im- port of holding that science is a developing, corrigible enterprise. In his remarks on the a priori he argues as if the scientist knew in advance of his investigation what science is and what are its objectives and its limita- tions as to subject matter. But what we shall find if we study the history of science is that science is an enterprise that corrects itself and clarifies its own objectives as it improves its methods and enlarges slowly the areas within which it applies them. The enlargement had gone so far that there is today no range of experience which, by cloaking itself in mystery, can escape its searchlight. Mr. Wheelwright thinks of science on the model of deductive systems - witness his confusion of mathematics with physical science on p. 463 - he cannot therefore see the significance of the element of discovery which is essential to the enterprise, and hence he conceives of the scientist as if he were bound in advance by subject matter and techniques of procedure. If he were he would not have ventured beyond classical mechanics and astronomy. The scientist's pre-conceptions of what he is about consist of loose and tentative habits of procedure and generalized methodological prescriptions, the results of previous inquiries, and subject to change at any moment. Apriorism maintains that there are propositions that are gathered through but not from experience, that cannot be corrected by experience, but that have normative empirical refer- ence. Only a humptidumptian willfulness would lead anyone to call a proposition a priori that comes from experience and can be corrected by it. Mr. Wheelwright also argues that I left out of my definition of science the important fact that it quantifies its results and is thus forced to express them in physical terms. I did leave quantification out of my account of science, and for several reasons. If I had included it as an essential feature of the scientific enterprise I would have to exclude from the term "science" those knowledge-getting activities which have not yet achieved quantifica- tion. But doing so would force on me several difficulties which I would be at a loss how to face. For note that what is involved is a rigorous dis- tinction in kind between the exact sciences and the nonquantified, on the</page><page sequence="5">COMMUNICATION 95 alleged ground that quantification involves the reduction of subject matter to physical terms. If I made this distinction in kind I would be em- barrassed by the fact that both share the same essential aims, the acquisi- tion of empirically verifiable knowledge, and hence the same basic method and empirical procedure of verification. Again, starting from a distinction in kind, I could not explain how sciences that at one stage in their develop- ment are inexact often become exact sciences in which techniques of quantification replace mere appreciative judgments. Again, I would have to accept the same traditional error into which I am afraid Mr. Wheel- wright has fallen, the error of interpreting the quantitative results of the exact sciences as involving an ontological reduction to materialistic terms, in which case the spectral ghosts of substantialistic philosophy would stalk me again. Mr. Wheelwright argues that the scientist does not work with sound but with air waves: does he mean that the scientist reduces sound to air waves? I am not certain of what he means by his statements at the bottom of 461 and top of 462. In any case what the physicist actually does is search for the physical conditions of sound, and by the term "physical" is here only meant the measurable conditions. Exact measurement is of course of the utmost importance, because its introduc- tion involves the clear and precise expression of the degree of invariance between grossly experienced events and some of the conditions that deter- mine their appearance. It seems to me that Mr. Wheelwright contradicts his best insight when he argues as if the scientist could go beyond his own frame of reference into a realm of objects substantially different from those of gross experience. This is a philosophical interpretation, as is clearly shown by his appeal to Kant and Bergson, and one I take to be erroneous. If Mr. Wheelwright took seriously the injunction to hold knowledge rigorously within its own frame of reference he would not be led into the traditional philosophic error of overlooking the fact that the scientist speaks of sound as well as of air waves. For it is with sound that he starts and to it that he returns, or his formulations would lack all reference and would not be verified by means of objects of gross experi- ence. In other words, by taking Mr. Wheelwright's injunction seriously we avoid falling into an ambiguity very common in those who use the term "physical" carelessly. In one sense of the term it refers to the bump- able, qualitied world of gross experience; in another, to the controllable conditions of this qualitied world as discovered by the physicist. It is high time that we quit playing peek-a-boo with reality by ducking under</page><page sequence="6">96 KENYON REVIEW this ambiguity. The physical conditions of sound are not sound, nor does their discovery reduce sound to them. This is one of the reasons why we naturalists deny ontological reference to science, and are able to affirm the doctrine of the unity of nature. This is a most important doctrine, one without reference to which the doctrine of the unity of method can- not be made much sense of, and one on which Mr. Wheelwright was significantly silent. Unless we understand the nature of the knowledge activity we are not able to understand how intuitions, which on an unduly over-intellectualistic conception of science are excluded, have in fact an important role to play in inquiry. For they can be expressed in public discourse and correlated with objective phenomena. Intuitions are the starting point of all knowl- edge. But they have no hegemony or prerogatives, but must submit themselves to an elaborate procedure of verification of a public nature, which corrects them by public means and in turn is corrected by them. The private voice of the soul is given its day in court, where inward ravings are discriminated from valid insights. Indeed I cannot see how anyone can argue that the soul's secret intuitions can be accepted on their own face value, as Mr. Wheelwright suggests in the last paragraph of his Reply. For the intuitions of men are notoriously unstable, vague, and contradictory. The result of accepting intuitions at their face value can best be seen in Los Angeles, where, I understand, any man, even if he cannot get a single Iowa farmer to follow him, can, if he has a mind to, declare himself a prophet of a new religion. This is the egregious bloom of protestantism, a result the great leaders of the reformation soon had to deal with and as promptly scotched. It is too late in European history to plead for intellectual anarchy. Mr. Wheelwright challenges me to prove that naturalism is compatible with religion and I admit that I cannot meet his challenge in his terms. But why should I pass muster in terms of what Mr. Wheelwright happens to consider a "genuine" conception of God and of religion, if his con- ceptions seem to me arbitrary and provincial? They are, since they are in- tended to exclude, on the basis of Mr. Wheelwright's inner secret intui- tions and his preference for one tradition, other conceptions of God and of religion. How a philosopher who is acquainted with the multitudinous ways in which men have conceived God and expressed their religious values, can challenge a fellow philosopher to accept his own definition of God as the only genuine one or be damned - that surpasses my com-</page><page sequence="7">COMMUNICATION 97 prehension. And in passing let me call attention to the arrogance involved in the ascription of uniqueness and life to one tradition only. My tradi- tion is as alive as Mr. Wheelwright's. And so is probably yours, dear reader, if you disagree with both of us. Sectarian definitions aside, naturalists can believe in God and many of them have done so. Nor do we need to go farther than our day and country: Woodbridge and Dewey have both put forth conceptions of God from a distinctly naturalistic standpoint. Many other names could be mentioned. I myself - if I may dare drag in my name in the next breath - believe in God. Unfortunately I cannot here go into the de- tails of my theology, which is probably not mine and which in any case I have never fully elaborated. Let it be enough therefore to say that the term "God" seems to me to have a common, an empirical and an objective referent in human experience. That referent is the creative aspects of nature which elicit intense emotion, whether of gratitude or terror, from men's hearts. These aspects have been variously conceived, but the em- pirical referent has never been altogether absent and is only denied by shallow or immature minds. I have no objection against anyone who says that the creative powers of nature are totally mysterious. I sought to suggest in my piece that nature's creative onrush remains ineradicably a datum, however minutely you analyze it. I must say there are times when I have no interest whatever in understanding nature and prefer sub- mersion in the sense of mystery which rises in us when we think of it in a certain emotionally relaxed state. This experience has its value, and to me it seems essential to complete living. But life pulls in many directions and nature requires control. And I cannot afford to employ all of my time and energy sybaritically tasting the ecstasy of mystery. If I did, I would deliquesce entirely. I know of course that my God is not a theistic God. I reject a theistic conception for many reasons and one of these is that it seems to me hope- lessly anthropomorphic. My own conception of God is purely empirical, thoroughly naturalistic, critical. It is cosmological, not anthropomorphic. In Coleridge's phrase, I would say that God is Nature's everlasting energy. But He is neither Father nor Moral Underwriter, and the term "everlast- ing" is purely emotive, since it is too soon yet to find out whether He will last forever or whether Carnot was right. I call the creative aspects of Nature by the term "God" because they are the almost instinctive object of my natural piety, and very little reflection is required to make me</page><page sequence="8">98 KENYON REV I EW realize that I am an expression of their power. Only a narrow sectarianism unworthy of a philosopher would argue that I have no right to use the term "God" to denote the forces of nature to which I owe my existence. If, with some philosophers, I should reserve the term "God" as exclusive designation for the natural forces that issue in what men think good, aside from the difficulty involved when we are faced by men's incon- sistent conceptions of their goods, I believe I would have to face the difficulty of finding another term to denote those forces in nature that make living brutish and nasty: the cruelty of the petty autocrat drunk with power, envy, malice, the ruthlessness of microbes, the sting of death, the indignities and constant lacerations involved in daily living -these also are moral features of life. On a restricted use of the term "God" I would have at least to double my deities and to imagine that God shares his dominion with Another, His opposite, and as far as my experience goes, His peer. I should like to close with my version of the issue between tradition- alists like Mr. Wheelwright and myself. I take it to be this: We "modern men of secular habits" are not deaf. But we do find the simple old airs of our ancestors and their Tertullian hocus-pocus uninteresting, because they are incapable of serving as expressive vehicles for our complex ex- perience and our intellectual sophistication. Mr. Wheelwright argues as if we naturalists were breaking utterly with our heritage. And we our- selves sometimes make the serious mistake of supposing that this is really what we want to do. What we are really trying to do is to save that which is for us of value in the traditions - in the plural - of our culture. This is what philosophers have always tried to do. Since Plato's day, they have been salvagers. The job is never done once and for all. Philosophers pluck the core of truth from the integument of dying error in which it is at any one moment encased. Once free, we propose to let the truth we rescue find its own institutional expression in our culture as best it can. But mark that that expression must be expected to differ radically from past ones, for our culture differs from past ones in the radical fact that it stumbled on the Aladdin's lamp of science.
