<plain_text><page sequence="1">SK CARROLL AND HIS ALICE BOOKS AUSTIN WARREN SOME months ago, during prolonged trouble with my eyes, I could read only an hour a day, a severe regimen for a man of letters. To what book or books could I devote my precious permitted hour? Obviously it must be concen trated fare, sustaining and enriching, providing matter first for close scrutiny and then for subsequent meditation. The books which, after I had mentally surveyed my library, al most thrust themselves into my hands as fulfilling these needs were the Alice books of Lewis Carroll, for they are a unique compound of poetry and philosophy, both prime forms which expand in the mind and sensibility. My choice of books was so right that I compose this essay in gratitude. When my sight had sufficiently recovered, I addressed my self to my essayist's homework. One ideal reader I know, a highly intelligent woman who is neither a teacher nor a reviewer, insists on reading a famous book first without any apparatus, and only then, if at all, checking her judgment by reading what the critics, and perhaps the scholars and the biographers, have to say. But that is a procedure too pure for a bookman like me, even though I have never lost for long the sheer pleasure of reading. By habit I move back and forth between what one of my academic colleagues used to call the original work itself (the forts et origo, after all, of all the aids and commentaries) and the aids: biographies of Dodgson-Carroll; other writings by Dodgson ? 1980. Austin Warren. 0037-3052/80/0715-0331/$01.86/0.</page><page sequence="2">332 CARROLL AND HIS ALICE BOOKS and Carroll, the specialized parts of a whole Oxford bachelor don who was fond of logic, mathematics, games, puzzles, and little girls; a few critical essays on Carroll's Alice books; then back to the Alice books; then back to the aids?in and out, out and in. The final necessity for a critic is, ideally, space and time for withdrawal to achieve critical distancing. To savor the Alice books fully one must read Martin Gardners Annotated Alice (1960), the wide margins of which, like a variorum Shakespeare, provide explanation and commentary accumulated over the generations. These notes include glosses on words, some purely British, some archaic; also proposed identifications of the characters in the tales with historic personages and persons in the family life of the little Liddells; also the speculations of philosophers who have taken texts for discourses on time, meaning, and identity from Carroll?especially from the philosophers' fa vorite, Through the Looking-Gtass. Critical essays on the books are strangely rare. I can recom mend only two: Edmund Wilsons "C. L. Dodgson? The Poet-Logician' (1932) and William Empson's "Alice in Wonderland: The Child as Swain" (1935). Both are Drilliant and suggestive?Wilson, for example, when he finds Carroll nearer to Donne and Swift than to "whimsical writers like Barrie and Milne. Wilson more centrally addresses author and text; Empson characteristically coruscates Empsonianly all over the place, taking a wide freedom of associative inter pretation. The big biographies of Carroll by Florence Lennon (1945), an excellent book, and Derek Hudson (1954)?the latter humorless and boring?are both exhaustive, too long and too detailed for a man so slight, of daily and yearly routines so unvaried. Roger Lancelyn Green, author of another long biography, has summarized his big book in a shorter one (1960) which contains all a reader of the Alice books can possibly need. But by far the best biographical book I have found is the most recent, a 120-page sketch by John Putney ( 1976), aptly called Carroll and His World, with</page><page sequence="3">AUSTIN WARREN 333 copious illustrations, chiefly from contemporary magazines, with telling quotations, and with sociologically and psycho logically acute comments. The pictures really illuminate Put ney's text without being a substitute for it?in this respect like Tenniers illustrations of the Alice books. It seems natural to assume that an author is the cause and his books are the effects; that the cause, by including them, must be greater than the effects; that an author must be greater than his works. But such a theory does not tally well with what we find when we match biography with the great est works of their authors, which dwarf their creators. Here we may partly be contrasting the chaotic and messy lives of the giant novelists, Dostoevsky and Dickens, with the powerful and carefully ordered Crime and Punishment and Bleak House. Or we can be thinking of how brief, generally, is the period during which a creative writer is writing at ms best: theorists agree on ten or fifteen years, coming earliest for lyric poets, later for dramatists and novelists. The great est writers have their three or four periods, each with its norm and its interval of respite followed by renewal: Eliot and Yeats, Mann and Joyce, among the moderns, as well as Dante and Shakespeare and Goethe, the three supreme writers of the West. The great books for which Carroll is remembered were written within ten years ( 1862-1871 ) when their author was in his thirties. They were written by the handsome young man with the long wavy black hair and the dreamy face whom we can see in several early photographs of him. Charles Dodgson lived to be sixty-six and, as writers will, kept on writing, and prolifically; yet, unless one makes an exception for The Hunting of the Snark and his letters to little girls, none of it seems worth much?even Sylvie and Bruno, which he intended to be his masterpiece. Dodgson was a fussy bachelor don, bothering with endless schemes and schedules, devices, the loving inventor and contriver. The narrowness of the man contrasts sharply with</page><page sequence="4">334 CARROLL AND HIS ALICE BOOKS the imaginative magnitude of his two read books. Some liter ary men lead lives which have an interest almost independent of any light they may cast on the books they wrote; some times, indeed, those lives are more interesting, more dramatic as myths, than the books: such are the lives of Byron and the Brontes, of Scott Fitzgerald and Hemingway. This is not the case with Dodgson. What matters to those whose in terest is in his books can briefly be summarized. Charles Dodgson was born into almost the best of Victorian worlds, for his father was a gentleman, an Oxford man, and an Anglican rector. The archdeacon held a country parish (first in Cheshire, the home of the celebrated Cat), and he reared a large family of three sons and seven daughters. His large rectory at Crofts was set in spacious grounds: here Charles had his pets?snails, toads, earthworms, little crea tures such as those Alice found underground. Charles's father tutored him in mathematics and the classics during the year he spent at home, between Rugby and Oxford. At Rugby he took little interest in games, preferring long walks in the country, reading the new books, poetry and novels included (all his life he kept up with current literature, Dickens as well as Tennyson for example), and writing letters to one or another of his seven sisters. His beloved mother died when he was in his first term at Oxford, but his relations with his father were, and continued to be, not only respectful, but loving: no Oedipus complex has ever been sniffed out. He was early a literary man, writing home magazines, like The Rectory Umbrella, for the pleasure of authorship and the entertainment of his brothers and his sisters; he was a home author before he became a published one; and all his later life he kept up an amateur's kind of private literary activity, writing and publishing, at his own expense, many pamphlets on subjects from letter-writing to public reform flie also paid for the first publication of the Alice books and not only chose and supervised Tenniel but paid him for illus trating them). In a real sense he became a public author only bv chance.</page><page sequence="5">AUSTIN WARREN 335 He spent his professional life at Christ Church, Oxford, where in 1852 he became a student (fellow) at the recom mendation of Edward Pusey, the celebrated Anglo-Catholic, whose views Dodgson never shared. His first book, a Syllabus of Plane Algebraical Geometry, appeared in 1860; in 1861 he was ordained deacon by Bishop Wilberforce. He was lecturer in mathematics at Christ Church from 1860 till 1881, when he resigned the office; it never gave him pleasure, be cause he disliked teaching undergraduates. In 1882 he be came curator of the senior common room at Christ Church, a fussy post which he held till 1892. The books on mathe matics and logic written by Dodgson, the Oxford don, are listed in an appendix to Mrs. Lennon's book; and in her chapter 15 she summarizes expert opinion on the value of them: they were not much regarded in his own time or later. Yet never should we forget Dodgson's gifts to Carroll. His external life was dull and monotonous, but his interior life was one of small but intense excitements. He had his photography, which he took up in 1856, photography divided between celebrities and little girls; and he had his letter writing, similarly divided. "One-third of my life seems to go in receiving letters," he wrote in 1879, "and the other two thirds in answering them."0 His meticulous Register of Let ters Received and Sent, begun when he was twenty-eight, and continued for the remaining thirty-seven years of his life, recorded 98,721 sent items; and there were besides some thing like 5,000 letters received and sent in pursuance of his duties as curator of the senior common room. The Oxford don had one special and strange passion which united his photography and his letter-writing, the passion for "The Letters of Lewis Carroll, edited by Morton N. Cohen, with the assistance of Roger Lancelyn Green. 2 vols. 1,246 pages. Oxford University Press, 1979. $60. These two handsome volumes of the letters collect the immense amount which has survived. The editing is meticulous: the scholarly annotations identify nearly all the little girls to whom Carroll wrote, and what happened to them in later life, and who their descendants were. However, the best letters have already been used, and quoted, by all the biographers; and the multiplication of more and more letters does not add either to one's pleasure or to one's knowledge of Carroll's character.</page><page sequence="6">336 CARROLL AND HIS ALICE BOOKS little girls of the kissable and huggable age of (approxi mately) from seven to fourteen. "About his child-friendships/, says Putney, "he was never secretive, indeed always quite explicit. He was totally self-centered. He knew and got what he wanted. He expected them to end with the end of child hood: as he wrote, 'About nine out of ten, I think, of my child friendships got shipwrecked at the critical point, "where the stream and the river meet," and the child-friends, once so affectionate, became uninteresting acquaintances, whom I have no right to see again/ " Much of Dodgson's correspondence was with the mothers of the little girls whom he wished to have friendship with, to entertain at tea or dinner, take to the theater, or photo graph, preferably nude. To a male friend, one of his illustra tors, he wrote: "I wish I could dispense with all costume, naked children are so perfectly pure and lovely, but 'Mrs. Grundy' would be furious." He wanted, as he became clear and unabashed, to see the little girls singly. It is a tribute to Dodgson's character and his diplomacy that, strange as was his taste and un-Victorian as was his explicitness, he suc ceeded in disalarming so many mothers of prospective girl friends. The hardest to deal with was the first, Mrs. Liddell, the wife of the dean of Christ Church and the mother of the original Alice; but he presumably learned by his fumbling practice with her. Through the Looking-Glass was inspired by a second Alice, surnamed Raikes; The Hunting of the Snark by a third little girl, Gertrude Chattaway; the succession went on long after Dodgson ceased to write his masterpieces. But all the little girls were little ladies. Dodgson was an amiable but undevi ating snob, as is his Alice, who took for granted a world of nurseries and home schoolrooms, of nurses and governesses and servants. Dodgson was a stammerer, as were most of his seven sisters; but this embarrassment, which he suffered in talking to other adults, other dons, and in preaching?one of his rea sons for not undertaking parish work?disappeared in the</page><page sequence="7">AUSTIN WARREN 337 company of litde girls, with whom he became Carroll, the charming, infinitely ingenious companion and entertainer, who read their minds, knew what they thought and what they wanted. He could speak out, become Carroll, only under the mask of the story-teller. This is an advantage which novelists have over the rest of us. They can, without shame, externalize, project, all of their plural selves, their interior conflicts, cre ating the saint and the villain, the fool and the wise man out of themselves. The Red Queen and the White Queen are both Carroll. Alice herself represents the sensible and the conventional part of him; the "creatures" whom Alice meets, his rebellious, questioning, speculative parts. The two Alice books are unflaggingly alive throughout; they contain none of the unreal, stagey, fictional clich?s which derive not from life but from an author's unassimilated reading. A book is not only a creation of the author's personality but a part of literary history. There are two traditional genres to which the Alice books belong: the Dream and Children's Books. The lofty ancestors of the Alice books are Dante and The Vision of Piers Plowman, Pilgrim's Progress, the Old Testa ment visions of Joseph and Daniel, and the book of Revela tion and all apocalyptic books. The dream as a literary con vention is perhaps the most serious form of literature, more deeply real than the nineteenth-century realism of matter-of fact detail, real with the reality of poetry and philosophy and religion. Freud and Jung have reinstated the psychic im portance of dreams and of the subconscious from which they come. Joyce's Finnegans Wake has perhaps restored the dream as a literary form. Carroll's fictive dreams are a vehicle for conveying wonders within a commonsense framework. They are not devoid of speculation on how we know which the real world is, whether that of sleep or that of waking consciousness?the topic to which Descartes devotes several pages of his Discourse</page><page sequence="8">338 CARROLL AND HIS ALICE BOOKS on Method. Mainly the dream is a convention which allows Carroll to introduce talking flowers and talking animals, a world still open to small children and to adults who can suspend their tiresome anthropomorphism and listen to what flowers may have to say. And, as in our own night dreams, the convention allows of shifts, transformations, metamorphoses: the Duchess's baby turning into a pig; the White Queen turning into an old sheep who first is a shop keeper and then the rower of a boat; the Cheshire cat which fades into a metaphysical grin; and not the least the constant shifts in size of Alice in relation to other things and persons ?the relativity of size. In a dream mythological creatures like the Gryphon and the Unicorn and the Mock Turtle are as real as any other creature; so are the figures out of the nursery-rhymes (the small child's traditional literature), Humpty Dumpty and the Tweedle brothers. And even the food (and eating plays a large part in the Alice dreams) is animated: witness the talking leg of mutton and the sentient plum pudding at Alice's coronation feast. Incomparably the best survey of children's books is F. J. Harvey Darton's Children's Books in England: Five Centuries of Social Life (1932; 1958). Darton begins with fables, ro mance, and courtesy books. The tradition of the fable, the talking animal story, with its moral, is long-lived. One edition of Aesop, designed for children, was illustrated by John Tenniel in 1848: it was these illustrations by the Punch car toonist which prompted Carroll to engage him for the Alice books. Then came the godly books of the Puritans; then the pedler's pack; then, at the turn from the seventeenth to the eighteenth century, the fairy tale, largely under French in fluence (Perrault and the Countess d'Aulnoy), and the nur sery rhyme, of which the first collection was published in 1744. Between 1700 and 1744 appeared Isaac Watts's Divine and Moral Songs for Children (1715), Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719), and Swift's Gullivers Travels (1726): a motley group, only the first of which was addressed to children?</page><page sequence="9">AUSTIN WARREN 339 didactic verse which Carroll parodies in his Alice books. Gulliver is a somber and bitter book, replete with political satire and misanthropy, but the child gets only the talking horses and the changes in size?the pygmies and the giants. Then stories for children fell into the hands of theorists, the Rousseauists and the early Victorians: they become didactic: they teach science and morality of a prudential sort by illustrating the bad effects of disobeying the laws and the good effects of abiding by them. That didacticism might be 'progressive" or it might be pious (Evangelical or High Church); but, whichever, children's books now came to be a profitable market for publishers?as they have con tinued to be ever since. The Duchess said to Alice: "Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it"?doubtless true enough; but the morals of Victorian children's books before Alice were explicit. In the first chapter of Alice in Wonderland the heroine recalls having "read several nice little stories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other un pleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that, if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later." Before the Alice books, however, the reign of the didactic had already been challenged by the first English publication of Hans Andersen's fairy-tales, Wonderful Stories for Chil dren (1846), by Treasury of Pleasure Books for Young Chil dren, including the traditional British and French tales like "Jack the Giant-Killer" and "Cinderella" (1849), and by Edward Lear's Book of Nonsense (1846). 1863 is the date of Charles Kingsley's Water Babies: A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby. At the Back of the North Wind and The Princess and the Goblin appeared contemporaneously with Through the Looking-Glass; and Carroll was a friend of their author,</page><page sequence="10">340 CARROLL AND HIS ALICE BOOKS George MacDonald, an unfrocked Presbyterian clergyman. MacDonald's books are poetical, moral, mystical; their author was the progenitor of Chesterton, Charles Williams, C. S. Lewis, and Tolkien, whose mythologies populate the neo Christian world of our own day, "But as in Kingsley, and as not in Carroll, there was also in MacDonald an open, con scious, and sincere purpose of improving the young mind, as well as of letting its fancy roam." In writing neither to improve nor to elevate the young mind, Carroll was indeed unique. Darton's chapter "The Sixties: Alice and After" is profit able to read in the sequence of his highly intelligent, his torically oriented book; for it shows how little an historian, however intelligent, can find to say about Carroll and the Alice books. The Carroll books "fell then and still fall into the category of 'fairy-tales,' as Dodgson himself once thought of calling the wonderful book Alice's Hour in Elfland, though neither fairy nor elf appears. . . . There is simply magic, and even that is treated as just an extension of the natural? 'curiouser and curiouser' ... by an almost logical extension of properties inherent in this or that person or animal." And, while most fairy tales had been traditional tales of kings and queens and peasants once upon a time in a faraway kingdom (even Andersen's), the characters and situations in the Alice books were pure Carrollean invention and set in sexa gesimal England. The historian never succeeds in naming the special quality of the Alice books?their moral levity: the absence from them of evil (so present in the traditional fairy tales), sin, and sorrow. Carroll's central interests lie elsewhere: in the psy chological and the metaphysical, in problems of identity (like losing one's name, or the disaster in finding that one may not be Alice Liddell but Mabel, who lives in a poky little house and has almost no toys ) and of meaning, in puns and riddles. Carroll's view of life is not existentially serious, not tragic. Alice, and Carroll, live in a sheltered upper-class academic</page><page sequence="11">AUSTIN WARREN 341 world: a world before the Fall, almost before the birth trauma, a world of perception, imagination, and reason. And when one looks for parallels to the Alice books one is sur prised to find them in Restoration comedy and The Impor tance of Being Earnest and Ronald Firbank's novels and in certain philosophers and their books. No American parallel comes to mind: our writers lack the requisite sense of social security. Much in Dodgson reminds one of Bertrand Russell, the mathematician-logician, who all his life remained a pre cocious child with an overgrown head and an under developed heart; and there is something too of the early I. A. Richards, the semanticist. Much of Through the Looking Glass is an advance commentary on The Meaning of Mean ing, is a practice book in exact definition and in precise use of terms, in the exposure of such logical fallacies as the un distributed middle. In Carroll is also something of W. S. Gilbert?the Bab Bal lads as well as the Savoy operas, with their witty dialogue interspersed with wittily rhymed patter songs. It is not sur prising that Carroll tried to get Gilbert's collaborator, Sir Arthur Sullivan, to set the Alice songs to music for stage pres entation. Indeed the artistic collaboration of Gilbert and Sullivan had its counterpart in Carroll's difficult but trium phant collaboration with Tenniel. The special quality, or note, of the Alice books is their Heiterkeit: this German word, which has no exact English equivalent, lies somewhere between gaiety, cheerful serenity, and blitheness (the last a favorite word of Pater's). Without being tragic the books are serious; yet, even more, they are good-humored?perhaps like Mozart, to whom also it is diffi cult to find analogies, since he is serious without ponderosity; perhaps like Goethe, without the romantic note, entirely without Weltschmerz; like Auden in his old age. Alice in Wonderland begins by describing a book which Alice's sister is reading, one with no pictures or conversations 2</page><page sequence="12">342 CARROLL AND HIS ALICE BOOKS in it. And "what is the use of a book," thought Alice, "with out pictures or conversations?" This is a text for Carroll's own books, which mostly comprise a series of conversations or dialogues (some of them between Alice and herself) with interspersed pictures: first those drawn by the writer him self, who had an amateur's gift, and then by Tenniel, who now meticulously if grumblingly followed the prescriptions of Carroll. The detail in the Tenniel pictures calls one's close attention to the detail of the text: the two must be read together. Lyric (or song) is the other ingredient in these books be sides dialogue and picture. Carroll was a wretched poet when he tried to be serious: he became mawkish or senti mental. But Carroll was a masterly poet when he parodied? either a particular poem like Wordsworth's "Resolution and Independence" or a type of poem like the ballad. The cele brated "Jabberwocky" is a parody of Anglo-Saxon poetry, as Carroll originally printed its first stanza as being?Old English poetry as it would appear to a modern reader. It was prob ably also a fun-making at the expense of antiquarian scholars who made so much of the archaic poetry which was not to the taste of Carroll: he was very much of a modern and a Tennyson-worshipper. Generations of scholars have worked at the identification of the poems Carroll parodied: the results of these inquiries are accumulated on the margins of Gardner's Annotated Alice. "You are old, Father William" is a comic reversal of Southey's "The Old Man's Comforts," and "Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup" parodies a music-hall song, "Star of the Evening," which Carroll had heard the Liddell girls sing. Sometimes Carroll was poking fun at a didactic poem like Isaac Watts's 'The Sluggard"; but like all good parodists he was capable too of parodying poems and poets he ad mired (as, in our own time, Henry Reed's "Chard Whitlock" can be a brilliant parody of "Burnt Norton" without implying any denigration of T. S. Eliot). Parody is a highly ambivalent art, capable of praising out of one side of its mouth?for it is</page><page sequence="13">AUSTIN WARREN 343 a critical act to select a poem as important enough to ridicule ?and fun-making out of the other. No single straightforward unequivocal judgment is intended. The two Alice books are often treated as one; and it is some times hard to recall in which book a chapter occurs. But per ceptive readers notice a difference in method and tone be tween the two books, which were written seven years apart. Wonderland is nearer to the fairy tale (indeed in the fourth chapter Alice says she finds herself "in the middle of one"); and it is more spontaneous: the first three chapters, which narrate the fall down the rabbit-hole, the first changes of size, and the pool of Alice's tears, in which all sorts of little birds and animals swim around with Alice, is all one flight of delightful fantasy; another such sequence embraces the ugly Duchess, her cook, her baby, and her cat. Only eventually, after the Mad Tea-Party, do we settle down to a pattern, a scheme, based upon two motifs, a cro quet game and a pack of playing cards. (Had he written this book later, Carroll might have contrived the architecture of the whole as a card game. ) As it is, the whole book forms a sequence of blocks, like the two chapters on the Mock Turtle and the Gryphon, two mythological creatures who (as Gardner says) suggest two alumni sentimentally re creating the studies and the sports of their schooldays. But just as the book begins to seem a sequence of unrelated epi sodes and characters, related only as a picaresque tale is by the continuing figure of the protagonist, Carroll brings back, at the Queen's Croquet Ground, the Cheshire Cat, the White Rabbit, and the Duchess; so his story rounds itself into a story, ending with the nursery ballad of the Queen's tarts and the trial to discover the culprit who stole them. This first book does not end as well as it began. The story in its early chapters hovers around Alice's cat, Dinah, of whose skill at catching mice and birds Alice is ever, to the dismay of the little creatures in the pool with her, being re minded. It should end with Alice's awaking ("You're nothing</page><page sequence="14">344 CARROLL AND HIS ALICE BOOKS but a pack of cards!") and going in late to her tea. But in stead it ends with a sentimental two pages in which Alice's sister, "dreaming after a fashion," relives Alice's dream and pictures how Alice, grown and herself a mother, yet keeping "the simple and loving heart of her childhood," will gather around her her children and tell them the story of her dream. This is too literary and sentimental and Victorian?qualities the book itself so strangely and wonderfully escapes, perhaps because, as Carroll said afterward, he started with the descent into the rabbit-hole without thinking how the story (origi nally told orally) would go on from there. That oral quality, of a story told aloud, with the author improvising as he goes along, weaving into the narrative events and persons recog nized by the children who listen, remains never far under ground in Carroll's first book, surviving its translation from the oral story and its first writing down immediately after ward as the Adventures under Ground, illustrated by its author's drawings, into the book we know. Through the Looking-Glass, written seven years later written without ever being told?is one of the rare sequels which match their predecessors in quality. The Looking-?lass is unavoidably more self-conscious. A man who has published a successful book can scarcely undertake another without wondering whether he can equal his first running. And the second book is more systematically ordered. The chess-game, one which Carroll demonstrated could actually be played, gave skeleton to the book as no card- or croquet-game (afterthoughts to the narrator) did to the earlier book. And a secondary structure of motifs involves the three nursery rhymes, "The Lion and the Unicorn," "Tweedledum and Tweedledee," and "Humpty Dumpty" (advice picked up from the use of one, 'The Queen of Hearts," in the preceding book). If the first book is the book of a poet and a mythmaker, the second is that of a philosopher. The Looking-Glass con centrates on problems of language (semantics and semiotics), psychology, logic, and metaphysics; on the problem of faith</page><page sequence="15">AUSTIN WARREN 345 (belief, credence), believing (like the neo-Catholics, six im possible things before breakfast), and doubt: the Unicorn says to Alice, "If you 11 believe in me, I'll believe in you"; of definition: the Unicorn, again, calls Alice a monster (what she, of course, believes he is); of identity: Alice forgets her name when, in the wood, she is talking to a faun. Finally there is the ultimate question concerning the nature of Re ality. The Tweedle brothers explain to Alice that she is part of the Red King's dream, a claim she denies. But is he a part, instead, of hers? Who is the dreamer and who the dream? Is life an illusion, dreamed by God or the Absolute? Has God dreamed us, or have we dreamed God? In this tra ditional commonplace, shared by literature and Oriental re ligions, Carroll strikes his deepest metaphysical note, not in sisted on but reverberating through his book. The central character is Alice herself, a correctly reared, upper-class little girl of seven and a half who will one day grow into being a well-balanced, sensitive, and sensible woman, responsive and still more responsible, very British, the mainstay of the British empire; she has something of Victoria herself about her. In bad dreams most of us know what it is to feel menaced; to feel always in the wrong, unable to rectify the situation and reinstate ourselves in our good opinion of ourselves; to lose our name or that of the distinction for which we are bound?our ticket, or the money with which to pay our train fare: these are dreams of lostness and persecution. Resource ful and socially secure Alice never reaches that plight, or is never in it more than briefly. The "creatures" order her around and rudely question her, but she is always at least mildly polite, even with what in her waking world are clearly her inferiors. Though metaphysical, psychological, and se mantic questions puzzle her, her biological sense of well being and her "will to live" always quickly assert themselves. Both of Alice's dreams end by her doing something decisive. She shakes the Red Queen, who turns out to be her own cat, Dinah. Shaking is waking.</page><page sequence="16">346 CARROLL AND HIS ALICE BOOKS Red, in both books, is the color of vigor, violence, and passion; white, that of ineffectuality. The weak in Carroll are white, whether rabbit or queen or knight; red is the color of strength, and women are the strong sex. The Duchess, that later addition to the original Alice: is she red or white? A question not clearly answered. In her kitchen she is surely psychologically red; later, on the croquet grounds, she is less powerful than the Queen of Hearts, her subordinate; but, as she talks with Alice on the croquet grounds, digging her head into Alice's shoulder and moralizing, she resumes some thing of redness. On the evidence of the Alice books, Carroll disliked and feared older women, symbolized for him doubt less by Mrs. Dean Liddell, who disapproved of him and burned his letters to her daughter, and by Miss Pritchett, Alice's governess, who is perhaps the Red Queen. Except for Alice and the Queens, Carroll's is a man's world, one of men ineffectual in action but theorizing and argumentative, like the dons and fellows at Oxford ("How the creatures like to argue"). The White Rabbit, with his kid gloves and his fan, a kind of obsequious fop, is as ineffectual as the White Knight in the other book. The White Knight is Carroll's portrait of himself, a man endlessly ingenious but without any practical skill or power. The portrait shows Carroll capable of self-mockery: even the "aged aged man/A-sitting on a gate" is Carroll as well as the old man's interlocutor; the Knight is ingenuous, in genious, undaunted?comic and pathetic, "a faint smile lighting up his gentle, foolish face." Our author singles out the White Knight (his stand-in) as what, "years afterwards," Alice could most clearly remember out of her dream. Accord ing to Empson "it is the childishness of the Knight that lets him combine the virtues of the poet and the [Victorian] scientist, and one must expect a creature so finely suited to life to be absurd because life itself is absurd." Among Carroll's self-portraits, I think, is even the figure of the Gnat, the little creature who keeps whispering bad puns, an enter tainer conscious of being pathetic, an insect but inoffensive? a psychically white character.</page><page sequence="17">AUSTIN WARREN 347 If the White Knight is the unworldly intelligence of the second Alice book, the Cheshire Cat is the presiding in telligence of the first?the Comic Spirit of Carroll, the "ideal of intellectual detachment," as Empson calls it: the grin with out a body. In her first conversation with the Cat Alice asks directions: "Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?" "That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat. "I don't much care where?" said Alice. 'Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat. "?so long as I get somewhere,79 Alice added as an ex planation. "Oh, you're sure to do that," said the Cat, "if you only walk long enough." Tliis, the first conversational specimen I quote from Carroll, illustrates the close attention to exact language, the language of a logician and a semanticist, which characterizes most of the dialogues between Alice and the "creatures." Well-bred Alice, with her schoolroom knowledge of history and geogra phy, and, above all, of the Rules of Good Society, is rarely a match for these trained, if sometimes also whimsical, wits. Not knowing the rules of logic, and not trained in precision of language, she is often confused by what they say and often vexed; but she is sustained by her manners and her woman's sanity. The same conversation goes on. Alice asks: "What sort of people live about here?"?meaning Are they nice people, such as I am accustomed to at home??only to be told they're mad. "We're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad." This con tention the Cat proceeds to "prove" by specious argument; but the mind of the reader lingers over the Cat's visionary axiom "We're all mad," one of Carroll's philosophical Weltan</page><page sequence="18">348 CARROLL AND HIS ALICE BOOKS schauungen, like the view, in the second Alice book, that we all may be shadow shapes in someone's dream. There is a touch of R. D. Laing in raising the question Who are sane, and who insane, and what, anyway, is sanity? Such questions about the nature of ultimate reality are briefly raised and then dropped; but they contribute to the depth and reso nance of the books, the texture of which is made up of brittler, fresher, and more sparkling "upperwork" of logic and semantics. This texture of the books, both of them, is made up of jokes involving faulty syllogisms or puns and other linguistic tricks. For example, the Pigeon argues, all serpents eat eggs: therefore a little girl is a serpent. Or, more elaborate, tibe falsely reversed proposition that "I say what I mean" is the same, according to Alice, as "I mean what I say." Hatter, Hare, and Dormouse all pounce upon her: "You might just as well say that 1 see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I see'!" There are specimens of a precision half-logical, half-verbal. For example, at the Mad Hatter's Tea-Party, Alice is bidden, 'Take some more tea"; and when she replies, "I've had noth ing yet, so I can't take more," she is told, "You mean you can't take less." The wordplays are endlessly varied. Quintilian, Putten ham, and Sister Miriam Joseph could technically name them; I shall not try. Several times characters play the British par lor game of stringing together words starting with the same letter, as when the Dormouse remarks of the three little sisters who lived in a well ("well in") that they "drew all manner of things?everything that begins with an M . . . such as mouse-traps and the moon, and memory, and madness"; or, more splendidly, in the second book, Alice recites to the White King, of the Anglo-Saxon Messenger Haigha, "I love my love with an H, . . . because he is Happy. I hate him with an H, because he is Hideous. I fed him with . . . Ham sandwiches and Hay . . . and he lives?" which sentence the King fills out with "on the Hill." And this dialogue between</page><page sequence="19">AUSTIN WARREN 349 King and Queen-to-be Alice occurs on the same page with Alice's remark "I see nobody on the road," upon which the King comments: "I only wish I had such eyes ... to be able to see Nobody!" The shift produced by capitalizing, and so personifying, the neutral "nobody" which amounts merely to a negation reminds one of a passage in the first book in which Alice's wasting time and beating time are brought up by the Hatter against the reanimated figure of Father Time, who would do almost anything for one who kept on good terms with him. A bravura piece of punning is the Mock Turtle's story of his education under an old Turtle, called the Tortoise "because he taught us," the piece which includes the courses of study, with "the different branches of Arithmetic?Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and De rision"?an account which explains "uglify" as the antonym of "beautify." The sixth chapter of Through the Looking-Glass centers on language; here Humpty Dumpty, at Alice's request, gives a word-by-word exegesis of "Jabberwocky," the poem Alice has read in the first chapter. ("You seem very clever at ex plaining words, Sir.") Humpty Dumpty proposes his theory on the portmanteau word?"two meanings packed up into one word"?after having analyzed "slithy" as "lithe and slimy." He proposes also the ancient theory that names mean some thing: "My name means the shape I am"; but what does "Alice" mean? But he also propounds that words mean what he wants them to mean, unrestricted by convention. "When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean neither more nor less." "The question is," said Alice, "whether you can make words mean so many different things." "The question is," said Humpty Dumpty, "which is to be master?that's all." This much "puzzled" Alice, who indeed is often puzzled</page><page sequence="20">350 CARROLL AND HIS ALICE BOOKS by the assertions and arguments with which the creatures engage her; but of course Humpty, if we may think of him as speaking for the poet, is partly right, for such a writer, not of plain prose which must be readily intelligible to the plain reader, can in part bend language to his purpose. To this chapter there adheres a further interest: in Good Manners, at the Rules of which Alice is never at a loss, and in the Rules of Polite Conversation, which Humpty Dumpty seems either not to know or knowingly to flout. To argue when one is not engaged in formal debate is just plain bad manners: Alice is ever "not wishing to begin an argument"? nor indeed to engage in argument at all. Nor does she like Humpty's talk about "my turn to choose a subject" for con versation. ("He talks about it just as if it was a game!") This is also a good chapter in which to observe Carroll's skill in handling dialogue, especially the difficulty of handling the simple problem of who said what. Sometimes just "said" follows the quoted sentences of talk, but mostly it is followed by some adverb or phrase of attitude or manners? e.g., " T never ask advice about growing,' Alice said indig nantly." She does sometimes grow indignant, and once she utters the British monosyllable oh, "too much puzzled to make any other remark"; but mostly she is tactful, polite, occasionally calls her host "sir," and says " 'Thank you rather sadly," when good manners oblige her to listen to Humpty's repeating of his "piece." Like all successful authors, Carroll was often asked, by letter or by word of mouth, what he meant by his books. His re plies all amount to the same reply. About the Alice books he said: "I can guarantee that the books have no religious teach ing whatever in them?in fact they do not teach anything at all." To questions about The Hunting of the Snark his answer was: "I'm afraid I didn't mean anything but nonsense! Still, you know, words mean more than we meant to express when we use them; so a whole book ought to mean a great deal more than the writer meant."</page><page sequence="21">AUSTIN WARREN 351 E. D. Hirsch has written a book at once brilliant and closely reasoned called Validity in Interpretation (1967), which I often read, or read in. This sober book abounds in so many terms and distinctions that it is difficult to keep them straight. His central distinction lies between interpreta tion and criticism: interpretation is concerned with a work's textual meaning, which is the author's intended meaning, interpreted historically as what, in his lifetime, he could have meant; and criticism involves the judgment of a work's signifi cance?o? its larger bearings and application and its value. This is the distinction between the work of the scholar and the work of the critic, work sometimes performed by the same man, but commonly divided, with the responsible critic undertaking to assimilate the scholar's findings before he begins his own. Historicism is not enough: it leaves the illustrious authors embalmed, yet still in their coffins. Far flung speculations which heed neither the illustrious authors nor their fictive creations but aggrandize the "creative" critic and flout adherence to their texts are an abomination. So delicate is the act of resuscitation, of resurrection. Yet the immortal, the incarnate parts of the dead, their perceptions and cerebrations, clothed in the flesh of their very words, must be kept alive?else there is no continuity, no inheritable culture. The final word must be: meaning is, and meaning accrues, is not time-bound. Almost nothing in the Alice books dates, because all is so readily translatable, so lends itself to application. After Shakespeare no author is so frequently quoted in the English speaking world as Carroll, especially by statesmen and phi losophers. Today probably the aptest sentence is the Red Queen's "It takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place." But the books not only are, like Hamlet, "full of quotations"; they also abound in situations widely applicable. There is the Caucus-Race in which all have won, and all re ceive prizes (each animal, including man, excels at some thing). And the fight between Tweedledee and Dum over a rattle suggests one aspect of wars. This large applicability,</page><page sequence="22">352 CARROLL AND HIS ALICE BOOKS or "significance," of the Alice situations has certainly much to do with the natural symbolism of Carroll's images; run ning, fighting, the river, the wood (the "state of nature"). Carroll's books, although they transcend the Victorian age, were immediately intelligible; they are timeless by including their own time, not by skipping over it. They have also proved universal. Warren Weaver s Alice in Many Tongues (1964) engagingly deals with the transla tions of Alice in Wonderland (its sequel has been neglected). By now it has been translated into nearly fifty languages, among them Hebrew, Arabic, modern Greek, Chinese, and Japanese. There are over three hundred translations in all, the majority done in our century; the Chinese and many Japanese versions (at least sixteen of them) all date since 1920. Alice seems so British a classic?indeed first of all Victorian upper-middle-class British?that this universal dimension is even more surprising than its timelessness. It would seem also to be so tied to its style as to be, like poetry, untranslat able. Thus the most engaging part of Weaver's book is con cerned with how the translators handled its special difficul ties: the parodies, the puns, the nonsense words, the jokes which involve logic, and the "unclassifiable Carroll twists of meaning with underlying humor." The principle is that the mixture must remain the same. The translator must remember that Alice appeals?and has ever since it appeared appealed?to "children of all ages," who can be divided into literal children and imaginative or philosophical adults. Children chiefly enjoy the narrative; adults, the linguistic and logical puzzles. Like Pilgrim's Prog ress (which Hawthorne cherished as a boy) or Gulliver, the Alice books offer characters and wonders in a dream/ fairv-tale narrative which can entertain children of almost any culture, constantly overlaid by, and blended with, the ele ments adults find so irresistible. Yet they must finally be read or listened to in English, for Carroll is a master of style and tone, and the narration and the witty dialogue are not finally disjoined, but merge.</page><page sequence="23">AUSTIN WARREN 353 I have remarked the paucity of essays on the Alice books. Having attempted one myself, I am not surprised at that paucity. Occasionally I have written a critical essay which, to my own perception, so plucked out the secret of the books addressed that I felt no further need to continue reading them. Now, however, my critic's pride is humbled. I may to my satisfaction dispose of Dodgson, but I cannot lay by the books Carroll produced; I can but go on reading them.</page></plain_text>
