<plain_text><page sequence="1">GIANCARLO MAIORINO Linear Perspective and Symbolic Form: Humanistic Theory and Practice in the Work ofL.B Alberti IN THE SPIRIT of the fifteenth-century notion of man as the measure of all things, artists and writers of the Italian Quattro- cento formulated sets of values that pro- vided the individual with rational and clear perspectives on art, society, and the world around him. Some of the most striking ex- pressions of such an attitude are to be identified in the invention of linear per- spective-as elaborated by Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, and Alberti-and the prolifera- tion of a number of treatises on painting, sculpture, architecture, and even on the family. In a "preliminary essay" on the concept and metaphor of perspective, Claudio Guillen points out that "perspec- tiva, or ars perspectiva, derives from the Latin verb perspicere, meaning 'to see clearly,' 'to examine,' 'to see through,' and also 'to regard mentally,' 'to ascertain.''"1 Expressive of a unified Kunstwollen (artis- tic intention), this overriding interest in clear representations of man and reality found two symbolic forms in linear per- spective and the treatise. Determined to elaborate a critical approach which would supersede the conception that "a work of art is something utterly irrational," Erwin Panofsky concentrated on linear perspec- tive and the theory of human proportions GIANCARLO MAIORINO is assistant professor of com- parative literature at Indiana University. in "order to understand their meaning rather than their appearance." Since a work of art may indeed suggest more than it actually represents, Panofsky recom- mends that the critic "concentrate not so much on the solution arrived at as on the formulation of the problem posed."2 In this essay, we shall center our atten- tion upon developments in Florence during the first half of the fifteenth century. The interdisciplinary application of the concept of symbolic forms will focus on Leon Bat- tista Alberti, whose conception of linear perspective-as presented in his treatise On Painting (1435-6)-is related to its literary counterpart Della Famiglia (1437-41). If one notices that the most significant manifestoes of linear perspec- tive were formulated between 1420 and 1445 (Masaccio's The Tribute Money, 1425; Donatello's Feast of Herod, 1425; the Gates of Paradise of Ghiberti 1435; and the Deluge of Paolo Uccello of, 1445-7), and that the tomb of the Humanist Leonardo Bruni by Bernardo Rossellino dates from about 1445, then one cannot overlook the fact that Humanism inspired and sur- rounded those artists who preceded Alberti in the elaboration of linear perspective. We submit that Umanesimo fertilized that high degree of intellectualism, abstraction, and self-confidence that played a funda- mental role in the aesthetic and intellec-</page><page sequence="2">480 tual formation of Alberti's treatises on painting and the family. Although confident in such a theoretical world-view, the artist still was limited in his choice of representational material since a portrayal of that which is absolute and infinite must be drawn from those finite things which are open and relative to human perception. The point of contact between these two physical and intellec- tual dimensions becomes as symbolic for the Renaissance as the figural representa- tion of man was during the Middle Ages.3 However, while the latter formulated a spiritual projection beyond human reach, the former could also envision it as an expression of the almighty artistic self.4 This study submits that infinite and finite, absolute and relative, merge in the vanish- ing point, as elaborated in Alberti's trea- tise On Painting, and in the concept of virtui in relation to Della Famiglia. Moving toward a closer comparison be- tween the system of linear perspective and the treatise, one could correlate them on a theoretical basis; they do not represent life as it is, but as it ought to be. In both instances, the artist delineates an objective measure for a subjective and hypothetical definition of reality. In order to implement such an intellectualized world-view, Al- berti strengthens man's position in the face of reality by means of simplification and intensification. In light of these principles, the system of linear perspective simplified the observer's point of view, specifically with respect to the vanishing points in the painting. In a real situation, the spectator can stand at almost any angle and distance from the canvas, whereas linear perspective elimi- nates such flexibility by restricting the observer to a single position. In order to avoid problems of marginal aberrations and peripheral distortions, the surface of the eye was assumed to be flat, whereas it is, in fact, curved. As a result, the concep- tion of linear perspective ignored the com- plexities of perceptual vision resulting in the reduction of them to one vanishing point and to focal uniformity. In terms of space, lighting, and atmospheric ef- fects, the artist presented a reality far GIANCARLO MAIORINO clearer and more structured than any per- ceptual reality, as amply illustrated in the works of Piero della Francesca. Linear perspective corrects the distor- tions to which human perception is liable by introducing a geometric system. Each element in the pictorial space establishes a harmonious relationship with the rest of the canvas.5 In terms of pictorial language, man rests at ease in his environment. The whole system is based on the height of a human being, so that the artistic mi- crocosm rests on spatial laws that have a human reference. The writer clearly states that "since man is the thing best known to man, perhaps Protagoras, by saying that man is the mode and measure of all things, meant that all the accidents of things are known through comparison to the acci- dents of man."6 Turning now from considerations of form to that of subject matter, we notice that Alberti interprets his choice of subject in terms of a human measure in Della Famiglia. Confronted with the whole social spectrum, Alberti focuses on, as Max Weber would say, an ideal type: the suc- cessful merchant heading an exemplary family. The artist can thus master the matter of his art only by a process of limitation and intensification. The book's Prologue immediately recognizes the fluc- tuations and mutabilities of social life, which are identified with Fortuna: "Many families in Italy and elsewhere have been seen at the height of fortune and honor, then lying prostrate, reduced and ex- hausted. Often I have marveled and sor- rowed that fortune's cruelty and ill will seemed to have such power over men. Fortune's fickleness and imprudence ac- tually seemed able to seize families rich in heroes, abounding in all that is precious, dear, and most desired by mortal men, endowed with honor, fame, high praise, authority, and public favor, and to cast them down into poverty, desolation, and misery" (p. 25).7 At this point, the past not only enlightens the present, but it also motivates the artist to move beyond the limitations of the classical world. Whereas the greatness of ancient families like the Fabii and the Gracchi has "shrunk away</page><page sequence="3">Linear Perspective and Symbolic Form and gone" (p. 25), the writer proudly states that his family has "been able to throw off or endure with constancy bitter misfor- tunes and furious blows from a cruel fate. I see clearly then that fortune has too often been unjustly blamed. I observe that many who have fallen on evil days by their own folly have accused fortune" (p. 26). The contemporary human potential for impos- ing a successful order on Fortuna ought to be recognized as greater than its ancient counterpart. Notions like fatum, fortuna, uanitas do not necessarily stand beyond the reach of human ingenuity. Therefore, as is the case with linear perspective, Della Famiglia is constructed in terms of a human measure. Accordingly, Alberti presents exemplary patterns of so- cial behavior, which he synthesizes at the end of the second book as follows: "I have already written two books, in the first of which you learned how, in the well-con- ducted family, elders exercise care and discretion in the training of the young, and the young, in turn, behave as they are obliged and duty-bound to do toward their elders. There you saw what diligence is required of fathers and mothers in the bringing up of the offspring to good behav- ior and high character. My second book sets forth what are the chief considerations in marrying, and discusses the proper occu- pations for young men. So far, then, we have made the family large and set it on the road to success; now, since good man- agement is reputed to be extremely impor- tant if wealth is to be well enjoyed here is the third book. Here you will find a de- scription of a proper pater familias" (pp. 153-4). It should be added that the fourth book deals with the subject of friendship. Hence, the treatise provides guidelines for the life of the individual and his expansion in society, from economics to the proper age for marriage and the right number of children. Such an ordered organization of human life is extended to nature as well. Alberti suggests planting "many, many trees in good order and in rows, for they are more beautiful to look at if so planted" (p. 191). This attitude finds a precedent in Boc- caccio's description of the valley of the 481 Ladies in the Decameron, and it is reiter- ated in Leonardo Bruni's Laudatio Floren- tinae Urbis,8 and in the Prologue to Jacopo Sannazaro's Arcadia at the end of the Quattrocento. That nature has achieved a greater beauty because of man is under- lined by Giannozzo Manetti in On Human Dignity and Excellence (II): "What can we say about the subtle and keen intelligence of this handsome and virtuous man? . . . His artifacts can be seen everywhere, and the world with its ornaments, created by God for man's sake and gratefully accepted by mankind, have been made more beauti- ful and perfect by man."9 The artist does not consider nature as an enemy, but as a pattern to be studied, assimilated, and raised to the perfection of a human repre- sentation. On the other hand, the artist is concerned with fortuitous manifestations of life. What Alberti attacks in the Pro- logue to Della Famiglia is Fortuna, not nature. In fact, the latter constitutes apt material to be moulded by virtui. This formalization of nature endorses the final integration of art and science. As Ernst Cassirer points out: "The logic of mathe- matics goes hand in hand with the theory of art. Only out of this union, out of this alliance, does the new concept of the 'ne- cessity' of nature emerge. Mathematics and art now agree upon the same funda- mental requirement of 'form'. In this com- mon pursuit, the line of demarcation be- tween the theory of art and the theory of science disappears."'10 Once this process leads to representing life in terms of a reality which has been stabilized by the artistic self, then the Ego creates a distance between itself and real- ity. This distance constitutes a filter which allows the artist to exceed the limits of imitation in favor of a conscious and intel- lectual reconstruction of the world. Erwin Panofsky approaches the historical devel- opment of this double process of imitation and reconstruction in Renaissance art as follows: "Now this double demand, to face reality directly-imitating and neverthe- less improving upon it-would have been impossible to fulfill during this epoch if the expressly rejected workshop tradition, which, as it were, spared the artist the</page><page sequence="4">482 necessity of finding his own terms for dealing with nature, had not been replaced by something completely different which made this 'coming to terms with nature' possible."11 The critic finds an alternative in art theory, which stands side by side with the literary treatise. Consistent with this proposition, linear perspective and virtui also pre-condition any appraisal of reality. Direct contacts with life without the support and protec- tion of such devices would inevitably result in failure. Accordingly, Alberti states in his treatise On Painting: "Thus all the move- ments of the body should be closely ob- served by the painter. These he may well learn from nature, even though it is diffi- cult to imitate the many movements of the soul" (p. 77). Furthermore, "the parts of the body ugly to see and in the same way others which give little pleasure should be covered with draperies, with a few fronds or the hand. The ancients painted the por- trait of Antigonos only from the part of the face where the eye was not lacking" (p. 77). Therefore, nature must be arranged and then visualized in a space of geometric perfection, in which human features be- come stable patterns. The latter passage seems to have found an application in Piero della Francesca's portrait of Federigo da Montefeltro; his physical imperfection has been covered and adapted to a systematic structure. On the strength of this assumption, Al- berti moves a step forward in Della Fa- miglia, as he remarks in this enlightening passage: Nature herself also seems to have bonded and incorporated in things, from the first day that they see the light, clear indications and manifest signs by which they fully declare their character. Men are able, therefore, to recognize and use them according to the uses for which they were created. In the mind and intellect of mortal man, nature has placed the seed and kindled the light of a knowl- edge, and insight, into the remotest, most secret reasons for the clear and present causes of things. He knows whence and for what end things were born. To this nature added a divine and marvelous capacity for distinguishing and discriminating be- tween what is good and what is harmful, between injurious and salutary, useful and useless (pp. 60-1). GIANCARLO MAIORINO This statement testifies to the powerful growth of the human mind, which has mastered the most secret laws of nature, to the extent that man becomes its creator by means of a divine and marvelous capacity. Instead of mere scientific formulas at the service of art, the geometric and social rules which guide man's mastery of the world represent a symbolic articulation of the artist's creative powers. Human prag- matism has thus replaced natural causal- ity. In light of such an artistic treatment, Panofsky affirms that "nature could be overcome by the artistic intellect, which-not so much by 'inventing' as by selecting and improving-can, and accord- ingly should, make visible a beauty never completely realized in actuality."'12 The successful application of those prop- ositions ought to delineate a humanized life, and the accumulation of particular norms of behavior eventually adds up to a comprehensive quality: virtui. However, virtth is not defined by a mechanical addi- tion of all the individual skills which are required to cope with the many aspects of life. In the end, Alberti defines virtui as a global quality that incorporates fama, dili- genza, prudenza, ragione and gloria, so that it assumes a charismatic dimension. Focused on uirtii the almighty powers of the writer are transferred to the hypotheti- cal protagonist of Della Famiglia, who is endowed with the theoretical potential of a totally human fulfillment."3 Such a determined avoidance of Fortuna leads Alberti to prepare the ground for the appearance of the ideal merchant in Della Famiglia. Released from the temporal per- ception of the visible world, the artist's representation of reality becomes timeless. Since nature exists before and after any human life, the writer organizes a geomet- ric space before any figure enters it. In fact, Alberti states at the beginning of his trea- tise On Painting: "I call a figure here anything located on a plane so the eye can see it" (p. 43). The world must be ordered before man enters life. This leads the artist to provide the virtuous man with a pre- established set of values. The protagonist of Della Famiglia is not</page><page sequence="5">Linear Perspective and Symbolic Form simply intended to be born to life, but to perfection and success. Time is acknowl- edged as a series of rational stages in a sequence of perfect segments, as visualized in the paintings of Piero della Francesca, from the clarity of The Baptism of Christ and the Recognition of the True Cross to the more enigmatic Flagellation. Simi- larly, Alberti deals with economics, mar- riage, the family, and friendship in terms of a linear and theoretical sequence that is undisturbed by the trials of growth and the dangers of failure. Unnatural as this posi- tion may appear, it avoids the imperfec- tions and weaknesses which accompany educational processes. When the Renais- sance man enters the world, he is born to perfection. Since the protagonist should be considered in his consumate maturity, the world of art must be maintained at an abstract level. Therefore, the world, as delineated by the treatises of Alberti, should be considered to be in an ideal state. In a Godlike fashion, Alberti and Piero della Francesca structure the first day of a perfect humanity in a new golden age. As a hypothetical figure, the protagonist of Della Famiglia can only provide the illusion of a three-dimensional character in the flesh. In point of fact, he exemplifies a two-dimensional projection of the artistic self, as is the case with the portraits of Battista Sforza that were executed by Piero della Francesca and the sculptor Francesco Laurana. With regard to the painting, it is devoid of human emotions and totally self-contained; Battista Sforza does not establish any external relation- ship. The artist displays her ideal form and the simultaneous absence of life in the portrait by means of uniform lighting, reliance on the linear approach and the profile position. It must be emphasized that the illusion of a three-dimensional space must be followed by the illusion of a three-dimensional character. In order to keep the phenomenal world from entering the realm of art, the artist freezes the proc- esses of life and reduces his characters to geometric and hypothetical shapes. As a result, he has integrated man and reality in 483 an illusory world. Andre Chastel remarks that "the fact remains that the strict ap- plication to forms in space of exact mathe- matical perspective, as developed in the fifteenth century, tends to drain figures of their emotional content, to stifle those hidden impulses which bring them to life. So that from a certain point of view, 'exist- ence becomes unthinkable."''14 Such a pervasive avoidance of reality inevitably led to a proliferation of treatises. Together with the correlated orations and authoritative commentaries, these trea- tises must be acknowledged as the most representative literary genre of the Floren- tine fifteenth-century. On the Platonic side, treatises are associated with the names of Ficino and Pico, while the names of Alberti, Castiglione, and Machiavelli are familiar in a socio-political context. With regard to literature in a larger sense, one could mention the canonization that Aris- totle underwent in the hands of Minturno, Giraldi Cinthio, and Castelvetro after the turn of the sixteenth century. If one also considers the much cherished stability that Latin offered in comparison to the chang- ing vernaculars, then one can certainly understand the absence, in the Italian literature of the time, of genres that were closer to the weight and fluctuations of life, like the essay and the novel. On the artistic path, authoritative statements formed a continuous tradition, from Alberti and Leonardo to Paolo Pino and Ludovico Dolce.'15 Since it organizes reality instead of imi- tating it, the treatise is closer to architec- ture, which, based on geometric design, is more independent from the imitation of reality than painting. It must be pointed out that Brunelleschi and Alberti were architects in the first place. It is thus apparent that linear perspective and Della Famiglia intend to discipline reality from above, rather than finding a position in it. From a historical point of view, the distance which Boccaccio maintained from his book allowed him to recognize a physi- cal space with healthy human interactions that were realistically independent of his creative powers. Life and death, planning</page><page sequence="6">484 and chance, animate the world of the Decameron. Boccaccio presents a psycho- physiological space that is strictly linked to the imitation of reality. Similarly, Cennino Cennini does encourage nl^se imitation of life in his Trattato della Pittura (1390). With regard to its originality, Panofsky remarks that "when the painter was ad- vised to use a natural model, art theory lifted from a thousand years of oblivion the notion-self-evident in classical antiquity, purged away by Neoplatonism, and hardly even considered in medieval thought-that the work of art is a faithful reproduction of reality."16 As it happened, the potential of a psycho-physiological 17 conception of man, art, and society was superseded by rational counterparts in the fifteenth cen- tury. Boccacio's lively humanity was followed by the theoretical outlines of Alberti's ideal protagonist, much as the empirical spaces of Giotto and Gentile da Fabriano were replaced by the mathematical space of Masaccio and Alberti. A striking represen- tation of these two conceptions of space in art is found in Gentile's Adoration of the Magi and The Tribute Money of Masaccio, both dating from the beginning of the 1420s. The challenge of reality did not promote any comprehensive recognition of it; instead, narrative and linear distance provoked an eruptive expansion of the artistic self. With extraordinary insight, Erwin Panofsky realized the possibility of an ambivalent application of linear per- spective, "as either a systematization of the external world, or as an expansion of the personal sphere."'8 As the conclusive vanishing point of human ingenuity, virtui grows beyond the finite and adumbrates the infinite. It can order the family, the community, and the State, if one progresses from the head of the household to that of the clan and the nation. In a social system of concentric circles, virtu can be potentially extended toward infinity. Such a confidence can successfully move the Albertis beyond what the Fabii ever dared. By the end of the book, the enthusiasm of the writer has captured the reader's attention, to the extent that one forgets the abstractions GIANCARLO MAIORINO and limitations that his perfect fabric is based on. In light of Alberti's position, it could be suggested that the vanishing point pro- vides only the illusion of physical limita- tions; in point of fact, it represents an intellectual abstraction that organizes a total reality, as narrow or extended as the artist wants it to be. It could thus be added that it helps the artist to shatter the physical limitations of the frame. The vanishing point can organize a continuous and homogeneous space which, through that point, symbolically leads to infinity. Alberti himself suggests this effect when he observes an orthogonal line moving away from the base line: "This inscribed line indicates to me in what way, as if looking into infinity, each transverse quantity is altered visually" (p. 56). The illusion of reality presented by linear perspective does in fact vanish at the vanishing point, which, in turn, symbolizes an intellectual abstraction; at that culminating junction, the illusory finite becomes subjectively infinite, thus performing a function which is similar to that of virtiu in Della Famiglia. Both provide the illusion of a total order which the human mind can extend to reality. It is apparent that the vanishing point and the concept of virth exist as symbolic measures of formal constructions, whereas they could not survive, at least as for- mulated by Alberti, in a world of matter and lively shapes. The antinomy, as Cas- sirer would call it, between theoretical freedom and empirical necessity is finally eliminated; the objective world becomes a projection of the Ego. Linear perspective and the treatise do not acknowledge reality as an objective entity which is different from, or opposed to, the Ego, but they recognize it insofar as it can be potentially invested with the forms of artistic creation. Such a position apparently diverges from the potential relativism and realism that the new notions of time, space, and culture underwent in the Quattrocento. Further- more, the Umanista could not limit his individualism to a preservation of the me- dieval world-view, with the simple addi- tion of a greater awareness of time and</page><page sequence="7">Linear Perspective and Symbolic Form space. In those conditions, this new con- sciousness of space would have implied isolation and alienation, while time would have passed faster than ever. Needless to say, the Humanist chose differently. The moment man discovers the passing of historical time, he freezes it in a timeless system of intellectual resem- blances. As space is recognized in its depth and complexity, the Florentine mind real- izes its precarious and relative position in it; as a result, the artist denies real space in favor of a reconstruction of it according to abstract laws. With reference to the cor- related philosophical problem of subject- object in the fourteenth century, Ernst Cassirer affirms that an equilibrium be- tween the two "was attained neither by supernaturalistic metaphysics nor by natu- ralistic psychology, but by the scientific and artistic observation of nature."19 Such an attitude did not take the shape of isolation or escape with Alberti and much of the Quattrocento. The things of life were superseded by a network of har- monious and hypothetical relationships. The outcome was a very modern criterion of beauty. Confronted with Mondrian's non-representational search for pure plas- tic art-based on the universal beauty of harmonious relationships, as in his Com- position in Black and White and Red, 1936-one can indeed find fifteenth-cen- tury precedents for it in the architectural designs of squares and courtyards. More- over, the difference in pictorial composi- tion between Mondrian and the paintings of Piero della Francesca is largely due to the fact that the latter still dresses a strikingly similar system of harmonious relations with anthropomorphic and re- presentational shapes. It could thus be concluded that Alberti's theoretical outlook on life exemplifies the strength and the limitations of the Floren- tine Umanista. His abstractions were prob- ably necessary in order to draw a clear line of demarcation with the medieval contin- uum. In that, the writers and artists of the Quattrocento were certainly successful; their world-view became classically para- digmatic. Furthermore, the centrality of the system of linear perspective and of the 485 treatise symbolically identified the crucial position that the individual held with re- gard to the cosmos throughout the Renais- sance. Although, as Rudolph Arnheim points out, "central perspective violates the basic concept of the object more strongly than other methods of space representation,"20 one can hardly disregard the subtle and pervasive fascination that the baseless fabric of Umanesimo has exercised there- after. In spite of its dreams and illusions, it can still be acknowledged as a lasting monument in man's quest for an imagina- tive realization of eternity.

By and large it was followed, though not necessarily as rigidly as Alberti seems to propose. He required the artist first to establish the height of a human being in the fore- ground of his field, then to divide the base line of the field into segments corresponding to one-third of this height, each segment called a braccio . . . At the height of the person above the base line, the artist was to set the vanishing point and to connect it with diagonal orthogonals. Then the question arose, how were the transversals-the parallel horizontal lines crossing the ground plane-to be established? ... On a separate surface, the artist was to draw another horizontal line divided into segments in the manner of the original line, and to set the distance point perpendicularly above it at the same height as the vanishing point in the first construction, again draw- ing a set of diagonal lines from point to base. The viewer's distance from the picture was then expressed in terms of a vertical intersecting the new diagonals at whatever point the artist wished. Then, setting the two constructions on the same level at any convenient distance, the artist could draw horizontal lines from</page><page sequence="8">486 these intersections in the second construction across to the first. These horizontal lines would become the desired transversals in the first construction, and form trapezoids in conjunction with its orthogonals. The diagonals will always pass through the centers and corners of all diagonally related trapezoids in the first construction."

In his translation of Alberti's work, op. cit., Ren'e Watkins states: "Virtue (virtu) is a key word for Alberti as for Machiavelli, but with a different mean- ing. It is consistently linked in Della Famiglia to an ideal of ethical unity among men, service from each to all. Though Alberti certainly meant his virtu to correspond to the Greek arete and the Latin virtus, it is looser and more pragmatic than the connotation of those words in Plato and Cicero" (p. 18). With regard to the more general context of the fifteenth century, George Holmes, The Florentine Enlightenment (New York, 1969), p. 143, states: "The concept of virtui presents difficulties for the modern reader because it is a concept transferred in a semi-metaphorical man- ner from the sphere of individual behaviour to that of social behaviour, an example of the microcosm/mac- rocosm style of thought which came easily to Renais- sance minds but is apt to seem to us an an unjustifi- able personification.
