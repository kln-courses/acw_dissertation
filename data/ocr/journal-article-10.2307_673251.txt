Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univer- sity Press, 1972. 61 pp., figures, maps, references. $8.00 (cloth), $3.95 (paper). Reviewed by DAVID C. GROVE University of Illinois Ceramics, small stone carvings, and monu- mental art bearing Olmec stylistic attributes have long been known in central Mexico. Until recently the nature and chronology of the Formative period in the highlands was unknown, and several scholars held to a notion of Olmec origins in the highlands, a hypothesis no longer tenable in view of recent research data from the highlands and Gulf Coast. These books, Xochipala and Chalcacingo, have an underlying theme of highland origins. Their author, not an an- thropologist but a "student of Olmec his- tory" has made several contributions to our knowledge of the highland Formative period. In these books he presents his belief that Xochipala ceramics represent the begin- nings of Olmec art and that Chalcatzingo is a "sacred enclave" predating Gulf coast cere- monial centers and art. His discussion is completely subjective, his data simply his impressions. His arguments and logic should appeal strongly to the layman, but the serious scholar will find incorrect hypotheses and contradictory arguments because the "student" has apparently neglected his homework (new data). Xochipala, a rural village in Guerrero, provides the generic term for a surprisingly sophisticated Formative period ceramic com- plex which has recently appeared on the antiquities market. Xochipala figurines are some of the most imaginative, lively and naturalistic figurines yet known in Meso- america. The book Xochipala, a catalogue from a Princeton exhibition, describes the figurines and presents a stylistic seriation, for no stratigraphic data exists for this looted material. The seriation implies a chronological evolution from naturalistic (Early Xochipala) to conservatism (Late Xochipala) which, as the book's title sug- gests, is the beginning of Olmec art. It is essentially the opposite seriation Gay utilized earlier with Mezcala stone figurines (1967:6-7). According to Gay, the highly sophisticated nature of Early Xochipala figurines could only have occurred "within a highly creative and sophisticated tradition such as the Olmec" (p. 20). Although inferred, an evolution of Olmec attributes is not apparent within the seriation or photo- graphs of the figurines, and in fact Olmec attributes appear absent in Early Xochipala figurines, a fact noted by Gay (pp. 54-55). They appear in minor quantities in some Middle Xochipala figurines, but no more so than similar attributes in other highland Formative figurine assemblages. In fact, the strongest Olmec-style attributes appear at Xochipala, not on figurines but on vessels, unplaced by Gay within his Early-Middle- Late sequence. Those vessels illustrated (figs. 31, 32) are unquestionably late Early Formative, the equivalent to Tolstoy's strongly Olmec-like Ayotla subphase in the Valley of Mexico (c. 1100 B.C.). Gay states (p. 59) that highland chronologies are largely undetermined, but this is not the case at all (Grove 1970, 1971a, 1972a; Tolstoy and Paradis 1970). Gay's suggestion that Xochipala figurines are ancestral or in- fluential to other highland figurines (D-2, K, C-9, etc.) (pp. 57-59) is incorrect in the light of this stratigraphic data from other high- land sites. While the Xochipala figurines are some of Mesoamerica's finest and earliest, they do not present a paradox. New archae- ological data from West Mexico (Kelly 1970; Oliveros 1970) shows quite vividly that sophisticated ceramics, including sophis- ticated non-Olmec figurines, are at least as early in Michoacan and Colima as ceramics on the Gulf Coast. There is good data suggesting too that Early Formative ceramics in southern Mesoamerica and in West Mexico have received important influences from the already developed and sophisticated ceramic traditions of northern South America (Grove 1971b). I propose an alternative explanation to Olmec attributes in the Xochipala assemblage. Assuming Gay's seriation to be chronological, Early Xochipala figurines lack</page><page sequence="2">ARCHEOLOGY 1139 Olmec attributes because they represent an Early Formative West Mexican culture with its own sophisticated ceramics, uninfluenced from southern Mesoamerica. By Middle Xochipala, Olmec influences have penetrated into Guerrero and influenced some ceramics. The hollow figurines in Middle Xochipala (figs. 24, 25) need not represent an "Olmec achievement" (p. 35), for this tradition too probably appears very early in West Mexico, again I suggest, through diffusion from northern South America. Xochipala, though not reflecting the beginnings of Olmec art, is nevertheless important in its own right. Chalcacingo is a description, through Gay's eyes, of this site's paintings and famous bas-relief carvings. It is an interest- ingly written book with a number of fine illustrations. Having just finished the first field season of a projected three-year project at the site I have the advantage over Gay, who wrote Chalcacingo purely on visual impressions. Some of his insights aided our fieldwork, but others are fanciful interpreta- tions with little basis in fact. A detailing of these here would be impossible. However, they are so well presented that those not familiar with recent data on the Formative may swallow the chaff along with the wheat. Continuing to defend highland origins for the Olmec, Gay views Chalcatzingo as a religious "enclave," lacking major ceremonial architec- ture, with an art style "not a byproduct" of Gulf Coast influences, and essentially predating Gulf Coast Olmec centers. I don't agree with his spelling of the site's name and archaeological data do not agree with his hypotheses. The "Sanctuary of the Pictographs," the opening chapter in the book, is the first good published description of the numerous small paintings at Chalcatzingo. The author discusses these paintings as "Olmec," yet they lack definitive Olmec stylistic at- tributes. Gay compares these simple red paintings to European paleolithic art but ignores their strong similarity to con- temporaneous paintings at Oxtotitlan cave, Guerrero. Although far more paintings exist at the site than are discussed, Gay deserves credit for bringing the paintings to public attention. Chalcatzingo's famous Olmec-style bas- reliefs are discussed as the "Sanctuary of the Reliefs." His descriptions are usually thorough and range from excellent to over- imaginative. He includes two reliefs publish- ed for the first time (10, 11). Our 1972 project uncovered an additional four. A number of factual errors exist in the descriptions. His statement that "Number 10 is the only relief which shows some genre affinity with Olmec sculpture from the Gulf Coast" (p. 107) is nonsense! He omits relief 9 from the book, essentially implying it is a fake on stylistic grounds. However, relief 13, discovered in 1972, is identical in form and style to relief 9, and there is no doubt that both 13 and 9 are original. While Gay states that reliefs representing the stylized jaguar- earth monster mouth (1, 9, 13) have no Gulf Coast counterparts, they are in fact a fundamental topical theme of every Gulf Coast altar! Although their weathered condi- tion prevented Gay from identifying reliefs 7 and 8, nearly identical reliefs, 14 and 15, were uncovered in 1972. All represent small reptilian-like creatures with flame eyebrows, usually associated crouched above scrolls and carved squash plants, while above them are carved rain clouds and falling rain drops. Nearly ten percent of the book is devoted to "Altars," Gay's term for the numerous boulders at Chalcatzingo which contain ground cup-shaped depressions on their upper surfaces. These boulders resemble bed rock mortars but I agree with Gay that they did not function in this manner but were rather related instead to ritual water. Terming these boulders as "altars" is inappropriate, misleading, and detracts from their actual significance. The fact or coincidence that the elaborate altars at Gulf Coast Olmec sites contain occasional post-carving cup-marks, probably related to the ritual destruction of Gulf Coast monu- ments, does not mean that similar depres- sions on boulders in the highlands suddenly makes these boulders "altars," let alone Olmec. The same objection applies to Gay's "Monument 2" (p. 85), a crudely worked stone which suffers from a case of ex- aggerated terminology. Finally, ten pages in the book (pp. 87-96) are devoted to describing one large ceramic vessel with an alleged provenance of Chalcatzingo. I am not the only Olmec specialist believing the vessel to probably be a fake. Pragmatically, of the approximately 120 whole vessels and 500,000 sherds recovered in the 1972</page><page sequence="3">1140 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [75,1973] excavations, we have nothing resembling the vessel in style, form, color, or decoration. The anthropomorphic plaque illustrated in the book (plate 25) is probably also a fake. Chalcatzingo cannot be understood solely on its art. It is a complex settlement which we tentatively date as early Middle Forma- tive (c. 900-800 B.C.). It thus does not predate Gulf Coast Olmec centers as Gay suggests. Gay is unaware of the ceremonial area with major stone architecture dis- covered in 1972. Houses scattered in a dispersed settlement pattern and water con- trol systems including small dams are present at Chalcatzingo. The Chalcatzingo reliefs indeed seem strongly a byproduct of La Venta yet also seem to incorporate concepts possibly indigenous to the highlands (Grove 1972b). Obsidian workshop concentrations at the site suggest it may have been an important obsidian distribution center. These data unfortunately contradict the conclusions drawn by Gay in Chalcacingo. There is actually little in the archaeologi- cal data, when closely scrutinized, to suggest that we should consider the highlands during the Formative as culturally Olmec. The local cultures populating the highlands were ap- parently merely recipients of Gulf Coast influences. It is important to note, however, that West Mexican influences were apparent- ly equally important if not more so. References Cited Gay, Carlo T. E. 1967 Mezcala Stone Sculpture: The Human Figure.
