<plain_text><page sequence="1">Anthropomorphism or sub-anthropomorphism? An anthropological approach to gods and robots DENIS VIDAL Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement Since the 198os, a new area of research entitled HRI (Human-Robot Interaction) has been emerging in the field of robotic studies. It focuses on the empirical study of the relationship between robots and human beings. This article aims to contrast the findings of roboticists concerning the interaction between humans and robots with anthropological studies which focus on the ritual interaction between gods and humans in specific religious contexts. This idea may seem provocative, but it is argued here that such a comparison can yield valuable insights both at a theoretical level and at an empirical one. This will be demonstrated with reference to ritual interactions between humans and gods in the Western Himalayas. In an arresting sentence of his recent book, Rodney Brooks, a researcher who played a decisive role in the redefinition of robotics in the 1980s, argues that 'we, all of us, overanthropomorphize humans, who are after all mere machines' (2002: 175). More generally in this book, Brooks firmly denounces the tendency to exaggerate the spe- cialness of human beings and the refusal to accept the idea that one could eventually attribute to artefacts, and, in particular, to robots, the sorts of characteristics which are generally considered to be the exclusive privilege of human beings, such as intelligence, emotions, or intentionality. From the same perspective, he also regrets the fact that religion has regularly been used in order to emphasize the apparent singularity of the human condition (2002: 159-62). There seems little doubt that religion has been sometimes used in contemporary debates - particularly in the United States - in a way which appears to justify the defiance of Rodney Brooks. However, anthropologists would also agree that the con- ception of religion to which he refers is rather narrow and ethnocentric. One could in fact argue that far from confining people to a rigid definition of human nature, religious traditions constitute one of the most significant fields of human experience where the specificity of human nature is frequently disputed. Moreover, it is also a domain of culture where one of the cherished ideas of many roboticists - such as the idea that human-like characteristics might equally be found (or could eventually emerge) in non-human creatures and artefacts - has not only been seriously considered but has also resulted in the invention of ritual and practices based on this hypothesis.

There are of course a number of different ways in which these disciplines can be brought together. One may, for example, make a straightforward application of the insights from one discipline to the other, as we have seen from the increasing number of anthropologists who have used a cognitive approach to reassess some of the problems and issues generally associated with social or cultural anthropology (Atran 2002; Bloch 1998; Boyer 2001; Sperber 1996). Working in the other direction, there are a number of social scientists, inspired by the renewal of social science studies (C. Collins &amp; Pinch 1993; Latour &amp; Woolgar 1979) who have used the tools of sociology and anthropology in order to reconsider some of the recent trends and assumptions in cognitive sciences (H.M. Collins 199o; Helmreich 1998; Woolgar 2002). However, the approach I intend to follow is closer in many respects to that adopted by Alfred Gell in his seminal work about the anthropol- ogy of art (Gell 1998). My ambition is not so much to apply the findings of one discipline to the other as to demonstrate that a comparative approach may lead to the elaboration of new concepts which stretch the boundaries of both disciplines. In particular I will argue that such comparison may enable us to identify the existence of a whole family of entities - defined here as 'sub-anthropomorphic' entities - which not only share a whole set of formal characteristics in spite of their extreme diversity, but which are also - at a more fundamental level - defined by their common capacity to evoke a high level of co-operation from humans while creating an ontological uncer- tainty as to their nature and intentionality. Let me begin by introducing the question of the interaction between human beings and robots (HRI), concentrating in particular on the case of robots which are supposed to manifest some form of sociable behaviour.' This will allow me to move on to contrast some of the findings in this domain with the anthropological analysis of rituals which involve forms of 'concrete' interaction between people and supernatural beings. The ethnographic material on which I draw is taken primarily from my earlier field- work in the Indian Himalayas, which focused on the cult of local divinities (Vidal 1981; 1987; 1989a; 1989b; 2oo6a). The reappraisal of anthropomorphism The idea of a 'social' interaction between humans and robots has been relegated for a long time to the domain of science fiction rather than scientific research. It is no coincidence that the key references that spring to mind are the novels of Isaac Asimov (1995) or the films of Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. As a matter of fact a number of researchers in robotics quote the same references, claiming that it was such fictional works which stimulated their original interest and choice of vocation. However, from the middle of the 1980s onwards, a decisive change took place. The study of the interaction between robots and human beings rapidly became an object of empirical investigation in its own right, stimulated by both economic and scientific interests. It is this rapidly expanding area of research which is known as'Human-Robot interaction' (HRI).2 One of the most interesting aspects of HRI has been to reconsider the relationship between humans and machines from new perspectives. Such has been particularly the case for research which tries to assess the forms of sociability and the nature of the partnership which should exist between humans and robots in order to facilitate their mutual co-operation.

Royal Anthropological Institute 2007</page><page sequence="3">DENIS VIDAL 919 The merits of anthropomorphism Until recently most scientists and social scientists considered not only that anthropo- morphism was some sort of archaic or infantile reflex, but also that it was a method- ological mistake. However, from the 1990s onward, there has been a new interest in re-evaluating the significance of anthropomorphism, noticeable in a variety of disci- plines such as anthropology (Boyer 1996; Guthrie 1993), prehistory (Mithen 1996), media studies (Reeves &amp; Nass 1996), cognitive psychology (Karmiloff-Smith 1996; Thelen &amp; Smith 1993), and so forth. In this article, however, I will limit myself to robotics, where a similar evolution has been taking place, and where detailed empirical research dedicated to the study of the intricacies of the relationship between humans and machines has led to a profound reassessment of the meaning of anthropomor- phism and its importance (Duffy 2003). Far from discarding it simply as an archaism and a methodological mistake, anthropomorphism is now highly valued by many roboticists and computer scientists because it appears to be the most efficient and most spontaneous register through which humans establish - consciously or not - a strong relationship with artefacts or other non-human living beings. One only has to consider the intensity of the rela- tionship that small children have with their toys, or that animal lovers have with their pets, to be convinced of this. But empirical studies have also shown that, consciously or not (and often not), most of us display a similar tendency with most of the objects with which we are confronted in our environment, especially if they have big expres- sive eyes or any other human or animal features (DiSalvo &amp; Gemperle 2003; DiSalvo, Gemperle, Forlizzi &amp; Kiesler 2002). The limits of anthropomorphism All of us know, however, that it is not necessarily the most sophisticated toys or the ones which display the most human-like features that young children prefer and with which they develop the strongest relationships. The perennial success of teddy bears attests to this. But the interesting thing is that the sort of empathy that people develop with robots and artificial creatures appears to follow a similar pattern. Masahiro Mori is the scientist generally credited for having drawn the attention of roboticists to this fact at the beginning of the 1970s (Mori 1970). He argued rather convincingly that while a certain degree of human appearance seems effectively to facilitate the interaction between robots and human beings, one would obtain negative results if one attempted to build robots which mirrored the appearance of human beings too closely. The majority of researchers in the field of robotics have accepted Mori's conclu- sions, although there are of course dissenters, such as Hiroshi Ishiguro (e.g. Asada, MacDorman, Ishiguro &amp; Kuniyoshi 2001) and David Hanson (20o6), who attempt to explore systematically the productivity of such a closeness by conceiving robots which can be briefly confused with human beings. Furthermore empirical studies appeared to confirm these insights, which have been generalized to include our interaction with other sophisticated machines. It has been shown, for example, that we all tend, con- sciously or not, to anthropomorphize our computers (Reeves &amp; Nass 1996). Empirical studies also seem to suggest that people appreciate robots whose humanness fulfils the sociability required for a specific job but dislike them if their sociability exceeds this. One consequence of this is that computer manufacturers try to avoid the risk that people's expectations of human-like behaviour in machines will exceed their functional Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 13, 917-933 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 200oo7</page><page sequence="4">920 DENIS VIDAL abilities; otherwise the tendency to anthropomorphize the machines will increase the frustration of their users rather than facilitate their interactions with them (Goetz, Kiesler &amp; Powers 2003). The problem of such an approach, however, is that it does not always fully take account of the complex epistemological meaning of the evolution which took place in robotics in the 1990os. One of its most significant dimensions was precisely to question the idea that a robot should necessarily possess the cognitive abilities normally associ- ated with human beings as such in order to interact with its environment in a more 'human-like' manner. Rather, this new research focused on the dialogical nature of the processes which lead to the attribution of cognitive abilities to any sort of being - whether human, animal, or machine. The merit of this new approach was not only that it led to a concrete reappraisal of the priorities to be followed in building a robot capable of interacting efficiently with its environment, but also that it led to a recon- sideration of the characteristics required of robots in order to facilitate their interaction with human beings. A new approach in robotics Following the lead of pioneers like Luc Steels and Rodney Brooks (1995), some special- ists in the field in the 199os began to reconsider the idea that cognition and a complex representation of the world should necessarily be regarded as an indispensable media- tion between perception and action for building robots capable of performing autono- mous (or semi-autonomous) tasks. It was proposed instead to develop what came to be known as a'behaviour-based approach to robotics'. This meant, for example, discarding the considerable effort dedicated in preceding decades to conceiving mobile robots capable of establishing maps of their immediate surroundings in order to find their way in a given environment without the help of any exterior intervention. To borrow an analogy often used in this context, fish don't need maps to find their way in the ocean or insects to find their way in a patch of grass. Similarly, the sort of insect-like robots that Brooks initially conceived were intended to demonstrate that cheap robots, devoid of any form of central control and whose reactivity rested mainly on a few sensors, could in fact adapt themselves to various environments more quickly and efficiently that any of the mobile robots previously made, whose functionality rested on a much more complex architecture intended to enable them to represent their environment. These developments also meant that the sort of cognitive functions that artificial intelligence experts and roboticists had attempted to instantiate as such in machines (intelligence, consciousness, creativity, intentionality, etc.) were reconsidered by the new school of roboticists in a different light. They were no longer considered so central to attempts to give elements of autonomy to robots, as had generally been the case from the 195os. Now, cognitive abilities were considered rather to be relatively peripheral attributes of the machine whose emergence corresponded mostly to some sort of second-order' phenomenon. As a matter of fact, they were supposed to depend as much on the material characteristics of the 'creatures' which 'embodied' them as on their interaction with their environment. Still more fundamentally, the fact of attrib- uting (or not) various cognitive faculties to a machine (or to any sort of entity, from this perspective) was now left to the responsibility of the observer. One may find a good outline of this new approach in Brooks's formulation of these four axioms that he used in order to formalize it in the 199os: Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 13, 917-933 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 200oo7</page><page sequence="5">DENIS VIDAL 921 Situatedness: the robots are situated in the world - they do not deal with abstract descriptions, but with the here and now of the world directly influencing the behaviour of the system. Embodiment: the robots have bodies and experience the world directly - their actions are part of a dynamic with the world and have immediate feedback on their own sensations. Intelligence: they are observed to be intelligent - but the source of intelligence is not limited to just the computational engine. It also comes from the situation in the world, the signal transformations within the sensors, and the physical coupling of the robot with the world. Emergence: the intelligence of the system emerges from the system's interactions with the world and from sometimes indirect interactions between its components - it is sometimes hard to point to one event or place within the system and say that it is why some external action was manifested (Brooks 1999: 138-9). One cannot underestimate the fact, however, that not all roboticists endorsed this new credo with the same enthusiasm; a fact which remains true to this day. For example, not all accepted lightly the idea that one could disregard radically the necessity of implementing a more or less coherent conception of the world in the machine and that it played such a minimal role in artificial creatures' adaptation to their environ- ment. Hans Moravec, for example - a well-known roboticist who had been instrumen- tal in the progress of robotics research in the 1970s and who had worked in close association with Rodney Brooks at the time - completely rejected this perspective (Moravec 1999: 46). Similarly, not all cognitive scientists considered that it was such a methodological imperative to conceive only robots capable of functioning in a 'real' environment from the start. Marvin Minsky, for example, one of the founding fathers of artificial intelligence, still insisted in 1999 that 'a student who constructed a simula- tion of robot motion learned more in six months than ... roboticists did in six years of building actual robots' (cited in Hayles 1999: 245). Rodney Brooks has always insisted that he was only an 'engineer' whose main intuitions were only due to experimental practice. But this should not undermine the fact either that - in spite of its specificities - the methodological debate which took place in robotics at the end of the 1980s was also part of a much wider debate - still raging today - about the degree of importance that should be accorded to the notions of 'embodiment' and 'situatedness' for understanding the features of cognition in biology or in psychology (Hayles 1999; Kupiec &amp; Sonigo 2000; Varela, Thompson &amp; Rosch 1991). Hayles convincingly argued, for example, that still in 1999 'a defining characteristic of the present cultural moment is the belief that information can circu- late unchanged among different neural substrates' (1999: 1). According to her, one could then find a strong tendency, particularly among cognitive scientists, to consider that 'there are no essential differences or absolute demarcations between bodily existence and computer simulation, cybernetic mechanism and biological organism, robot tele- ology and human goals' (1999: 3). One indeed finds no better illustration of such a mentality at work than in the ethnographic descriptions given by Stephen Helmreich in his fascinating study of pioneering research into artificial life forms in Silicon Valley at the end of the 199os (Helmreich 1998). Even more extreme examples are found at a more speculative level amongst roboticists and cognitive scientists like Minsky, Moravec, or Kurzweil, when they seem seriously to consider the possibility that humans could soon be able to attain some sort of immortality by downloading the informa- tional content of their brains onto computer machines (Brooks 2002: 204-5). It is against such a general background that one must evaluate the originality of the methodological and experimental approach advocated by Luc Steels, Rodney Brooks, and a few others. In this context one can better understand why at the time these ideas Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 13, 917-933 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2007</page><page sequence="6">922 DENIS VIDAL were greeted by some not only as a breakthrough in robotics, but also as a fundamental shift of paradigm which concerned cognitive sciences as a whole (Varela 1995). What this new approach seemed to promise was the possibility of taking distance, once and for all, from the sort of hidden dualism on which the entire domain of cognitive sciences seemed till then to be largely based. Sub-anthropomorphisms It maybe true that ultimately progress in robotics will depend on technological advances; but if the ultimate goal of roboticists like Brooks or Cynthia Breazeal remains in the long term to build 'an autonomous anthropomorphic robot that could interpret, respond and deliver human style social and affective cues' (Breazeal &amp; Brooks 2005: 8), they are the first to acknowledge that for this to happen they still require new conceptual break- throughs (Brooks 2001). It is also because they are conscious of this that researchers in robotics do not hesitate to look for inspiration in other fields of study from which they might gain newinsights of use for their own research. Theygenerallyfavour neurobiology, psychology, or ethology. There is, however, one domain that most of them seem reluctant to approach, and that is the study of religion. This is a pity, because one could possibly argue that it is precisely in this area of research - and, more specifically, in the sort of relationship which may exist between the divinities and their worshippers in different cultural contexts - that one may discover new insights for understanding some of the fundamental issues at stake in the study of the interaction between robots and human beings, both empirically and from a more analytical perspective. Like many other anthropologists, I happen to have worked in a cultural context where not only do deities exist in the individual or collective beliefs of their devotees (this would not be of much use for an empirical comparison with robots), but they are also considered to be sociable partners in the full sense of the term in the local communities where they are revered. This is certainly relevant if one wants to develop the sort of comparison I have in mind. In order to do this I shall first introduce the cults that I have studied, focusing only on those aspects which are most directly relevant to the comparison I wish to explore. Divinities of Himachal Pradesh One of the main characteristics of the local cults in the Simla and Kulu districts of Himachal Pradesh is the central importance given to the social role of deities in the life of local communities.3 As a matter of fact, gods and goddesses regularly interfered in concrete ways in the lives of local mountain people in a manner reminiscent of the role played by their Greek counterparts in the Iliad and the Odyssey (Vidal 1987). And whenever I asked a question about these cults, the most common advice I received was that I should address my questions directly to the divinities. It was indeed a reasonable suggestion which I sometimes followed up because, in this particular context, it is possible to chat to local gods through the mediums attached to their temples. However, mediums represent only one of the ritual arrangements through which the divinities express their presence, communicate their feelings, and interact with their devotees. Anthropomorphism and the worship of idols In Himachal Pradesh, as in other parts of India, local divinities are revered in temples where the most sacred object of worship is an image of the divinity, usually in the form of a statue (murti) which is at the centre of a number of daily rituals (puja) performed Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 13, 917-933 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2007</page><page sequence="7">DENIS VIDAL 923 by the priests of the temple (Fuller 2004; Humphrey &amp; Laidlaw 1993).What defines such rituals, more than anything else, is their deeply anthropomorphic character. The priests take care of the temple idols in a way reminiscent of the sort of attention given by royal servants to their masters; but it might equally remind us of the sort of care many children show their favourite dolls. Every morning, the image is first woken up by the temple priests, then bathed, clothed, fed, entertained, and so forth. Such rituals will go on until the end of the day, when the image of the god will be undressed, bathed, and put to sleep. Similarly, but in a different vein, Hindu temple worshippers often describe how they'perceive' the concrete presence of the divinity when they revere it in the form of its image. Devotees will consider, for example, that when they approach the image of a divinity, the god himself reciprocates their look by glancing back at them (Babb 1981; Eck 1981; Vidal 2oo6b). However, apart from a few (miraculous) exceptions, deities in temples are not supposed to demonstrate their presence through their images too manifestly (Vidal 1998). This is in part what distinguishes temple rituals from the sort of rituals that I shall describe below. Possession and sub-anthropomorphism Once an individual is chosen as the medium for a divinity, he will normally remain so until his death. His main function is to participate in rituals in which he enters into a trance and speaks on behalf of the divinity (Vidal 1989b). Rituals of possession of this sort are quite common in this part of the Himalayas. They take place several times a year in contexts where the deity manifests itself outside its temple, but they can also be organized on an ad hoc basis at the request of individual worshippers. Divinities often speak in public through their mediums about topics which interest the community as a whole. But individuals can also approach divinities to discuss a whole range of personal matters from health to business and family affairs. The people communicating with a medium when he is possessed give the feeling that they are interacting with the god himself. In this sense the medium would appear to be some sort of anthropomorphic incarnation of the god, at least for the time of the ritual. However, the reality is more complex as the entire credibility of the ritual relies on the fact that worshippers retain a clear distinction in their minds between the medium as a simple human being and the medium as a vehicle of the god, even if the line of demarcation between the two often appears fuzzy. Rituals of possession have been extensively studied by anthropologists from a variety of perspectives, but the point on which I would like to focus here is the temporary impairment of some of the physical and mental faculties of the medium when he is possessed. Let me describe these aspects of possession more closely. When he goes into a trance, the medium loses partial control of his movements and his facial expressions; he also has difficulty maintaining his equilibrium. At the same time, he also loses some of his kinaesthetic sensitivity and becomes largely impervious to pain. More generally, he expresses feelings and emotions in a rather unpredictable manner, and his exact mood and state of mind (or, to be more precise, the mood and state of mind of the divinity which expresses itself through his person) are often difficult to interpret. The medium also speaks in a manner which is usually difficult to understand or interpret: his words are not always audible and coherent; the structure of his sentences and some of his expressions can be very idiosyncratic;4 the meaning of his words can be difficult to decipher. Furthermore, the medium is not supposed to be conscious of his words Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 13, 917-933 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2007</page><page sequence="8">924 DENIS VIDAL and behaviour while speaking on behalf of the god and is not supposed to remember what he may have said and done while possessed. Undoubtedly, for the people involved in these rituals, such radical alterations in the personality and behaviour of the medium are unremarkable. They are simply consid- ered to be the symptoms (and the consequence) of possession by the divinity and are therefore only to be expected. To an outsider, the erratic behaviour of the medium is more likely to be interpreted as complicating the interaction between the medium and the people and impairing communication between the two, but this is a false impres- sion. Far from impeding the dialogue between the gods and their devotees, the idio- syncrasies of this form of dialogue actually contribute towards giving depth of content, gravity of meaning, and an intensity of emotions that one does not generally find in more mundane circumstances. There is also another point worth noting. In order to manifest the presence of a god or goddess, the behaviour of the medium does not actually display 'superhuman' characteristics and capabilities, even if this is ideologically implied. As a matter of fact, if one considers the medium's behaviour from a purely behavioural perspective, it is tempting to describe the trance as a demonstration of the opposite. What one observes is rather a disconcerting demonstration of a systematic lowering of most of the cog- nitive faculties, which are generally considered the most 'superior' human abilities and the very ones which are generally supposed to distinguish humans from other living creatures. It is, then, in reference to this singular process of the 'downgrading' of such faculties that I use the term 'sub-anthropomorphism', to contrast it with the process of 'over-anthropomorphizing' which is more spontaneously identified by roboticists and others with religious practices and traditions. Mediums are supposed to demonstrate concretely by their temporary lack of control over their voice, movements, feelings, and manner of speech that it is effectively the god or goddess who is expressing him- or herself through them. Such rituals obviously arouse all sorts of anthropological questions; but, here again, I would like to limit myself to considering this ritual in the light of contemporary research about Human- Robot Interaction. What is fascinating from this perspective is that we are witnessing the (ritual) making of an entity whose reactivity, affects, movements, ways of speaking, and so forth, are supposed to manifest complete autonomy and whose new 'identity' can only exist (if one is agnostic) 'in the eye of the observer'. Now, the paradox is that such characteristics correspond precisely to the fundamental axioms that roboticists like Rodney Brooks (1999: 170) put forward when they attempt to formalize the way 'intelligence' and the 'emergence of an autonomous behaviour' may be legitimately attributed to robots without violating any form of common sense or rationality. There is also, however, another dimension of the comparison between Human- Robot Interaction and Human-God Interaction that I would like to stress. This con- cerns the ontological nature of the agents involved. What effectively complicates the interpretation of rituals of possession in the case that I have described is the legitimate suspicion that mediums may retain some implicit control of their behaviour while they are possessed. As a matter of fact, devotees are themselves wary of such a possibility; and they often resort to special ritual procedures in order to reassure themselves that when they listen to a medium, it is effectively the deity that speaks through the medium and not the medium who abuses the situation by speaking in the name of the deity (Vidal 1989a). There exists, however, another sort of ritual which is also commonly used in this part of the Himalayas for allowing direct dialogue between the people and Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 13, 917-933 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2007</page><page sequence="9">DENIS VIDAL 925 the local divinities. Its main interest here is that it is based on a different process of conjunction-dissociation between the people who enact the divinity and the divinity itself, allowing us to go one step further in the comparison between Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Human-God Interaction (HGI). When gods and robots come marching in! Hindu deities are not only revered as static images in their temples or when they are incarnated by their mediums; they are also commonly worshipped under the form of mobile images or statues which are taken out of their temples for special occasions. In Himachal Pradesh, these mobile images have specific features which seem to dis- tinguish them from their equivalents in India. One distinguishing aspect concerns their appearance. Mobile images of divinities (raths) consist of a wooden structure in the shape of some sort of palanquin, balanced on two long wooden poles, carried by two or more people. These wooden structures are covered with special cloths to which a mixture of ornaments and precious metal masks are attached. One of these masks, which generally occupies a central position on the rath, is thought to incarnate the divinity (Berti 2004; Vidal 1989b). Another distinguishing feature is the local characterization of the movement shown by these raths. According to local devotees, it is not the bearers of the raths but the deities themselves who are guiding their irregular movements. A foreign observer cannot help noticing, however, that the long wooden poles on which the palanquin rests are very flexible. Because of this, the whole structure of the rath is unstable, a point which may help agnostics to understand how the bearers of the palanquins may, in complete good faith, have the feeling that they are not really the ones who are guiding its movement. But this is not necessarily the most interesting point from an anthro- pological perspective. More revealing is the fact that gods are not only supposed to guide the movements of their mobile forms in order to get from one place to another; the movements of these mobile images are also used to establish a very specific mode of communication between the gods and local villagers. Whenever a local divinity is taken out of its temple, ritual sessions tend to be organized at some point in the ceremony, during which time all the villagers have the opportunity to engage in dialogue with the divinity. In order to do so, they will stand in turn in front of its mobile image and ask (loudly or silently) various questions to the god, interpreting his answers according to the way in which the mobile form moves in immediate reaction to their queries. The deity may respond by remaining still, by moving in one direction or another with more or less speed and intensity, or by regular jumps or erratic lurching and jerking movements. I cannot go into details of this fascinating form of dialogue here, which really needs to be witnessed for its logic to be fully understood (Vidal 1987; 1989b). But I would at least like to stress one feature of this very peculiar mode of communication: that is, the contrast between the intensity and continuity of the dialogue between the god and individual villagers, which may last for a while, and the apparent indifference of the bearers of the palanquin, who appear to take very little interest in the proceedings. As a matter of fact, their main preoccupation seems to be how to stabilize the rath, which often seems on the verge of toppling over. Moreover, different bearers often replace each other while a dialogue is still going on between a villager and the deity, without giving the impression that this would disturb the interaction. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 13, 917-933 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2007</page><page sequence="10">926 DENIS VIDAL What is at stake here is the emergence of some strange sort of artefact (half-human, half-machine) which is used not only for incarnating the presence of the divinity but also for developing a complex mode of communication with the villagers. It allows the latter to attribute to the gods not only the capacity to answer their various personal questions and requests but also a whole variety of feelings, from boredom to keen interest, from extreme anger to real delight - all of which are expressed purely by the movements of these mobile images. Gods and robots: a comparison As I mentioned at the beginning of this article, most Western roboticists seem to be wary of exploring any possible connection between robotics and religion, especially where Christianity is concerned.5 This is not necessarily the case in relation to other cultures. Connections have been often made between Japanese culture (or Buddhism) and an interest in artificial creatures (Kaplan 2005; Mori 1981); and it is certainly appealing to attempt the same demonstration in the case of Hinduism. But, whatever may be the validity of such a connection, this is not the perspective I intend to follow here. I wish to restrict my comparison between religion and robotics to the purely formal characteristics of the nature of the interaction that occurs between humans and robots, on the one hand, and humans and local divinities, on the other. The idea is that such a comparison may help us look at both of these forms of social interaction in a slightly different light. So, it is with this aim in mind that I would like to analyse now some of the main features of the interaction between local divinities and their wor- shippers in the same way that one would assess the performance of a robot in a laboratory. Sociability and identity Firstly, one cannot help but notice the paradoxical fact that local divinities seem to possess all the abilities that roboticists try to implement in robots, and this indepen- dently of all technological advances. The deities are quite clearly 'social partners' in the strongest sense of the term. Through their mediums and mobile images, they not only communicate information but also express their wishes and feelings. Each of them also possesses a well-defined personality which is not so much based on their mythology or upon abstract beliefs, but rather is directly associated with the characteristics they regularly display during interactions with worshippers. Moreover, the identity of the divinity is not exclusively identified with any particular material manifestations through which its presence is made tangible, even if it may be associated in a more or less permanent manner with certain specific artefacts. What is remarkable, then, is that both the incremental process of the acquisition of a personality by the divinities and their ubiquity echo very closely what roboticists and specialists of artificial intelligence try to develop in robots (Kaplan 2005). Questions of appearance Another current preoccupation of roboticists concerns what appearance robots should have in order to facilitate social interaction with human beings. The focus is usually on what general shape one should give to their appearance, what physical features should be put in evidence, and what diverse elements (movements, sight, etc.) should be used for indicating their mood and facilitating transfers of feeling from their human part- ners (Breazeal 2000; Bruce, Nourbaksh &amp; Simmons 2002; DiSalvo et al. 2002; Kidd &amp; Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 13, 917-933 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2007</page><page sequence="11">DENIS VIDAL 927 Breazeal 2oo4). The example of the Himalayan divinities is interesting from this per- spective. Firstly, what is striking is that the overall appearance of the rath is mostly indicative of regional distinctions and does not appear to play a decisive role in influencing the communication which takes place between the villagers and the gods. The use of masks suggests the formal importance given to the human face, but it should be noted that the features of these masks are highly stylized and stereotyped and that, contrary to what happens in the case of other forms of ritual or artistic performance in India (such as classical dance or theatre), the masks representing the face of the divinity do not have any movements of their own which would add to their expressivity as they are moved. All of this confirms the fact that in this particular case, it is through movements rather than through any specific detail of its appearance that the dialogue between the divinity and its worshippers is channelled. Questions of control and of interpretation The main point of the comparison between these local divinities and sociable robots should, then, really focus on the over-arching importance given to the rath as a com- municative device. One cannot emphasize too much the striking ability of the villagers to interpret the movements of the rath as the pure expression of the mood of the divinities.6 And if one tries to compare the movements of the mobile form of divinities with the movements of robots, one finds that just as in the case of behaviour based robotics, there is no obvious 'central unit' controlling the movement of the robot so, in the case of the rath, it is equally impossible to identify an individual agent of control. Priests and pujaris may sometimes be seen interfering slightly with the movements of the mobile forms, generally in order to tone down its movements during the dialogue between the mobile form of the divinity and the villagers. They may 'super- vise' also up to a certain degree the interactions with the rath, but they do not entirely control them, as may be shown from diverse ethnographic examples (Vidal 1987). In fact the movements of the divinities and, as a consequence of this, their interactions with worshippers seem largely to escape any form of direct control but are rather the consequences of the collective and often contradictory movements of the bearers. In this sense, one may be tempted to draw a parallel, at a formal level, between the movements and the behaviour of the rath and the architectural logic of the new generation of robots whose behaviour is also conceived as the resultant of parallel censors and of multiple processes of decision-making without the intervention of any central agent of control. Questions of psychological and behavioural coherence Another preoccupation of contemporary roboticists is their desire to instil in robots forms of reactivity and behaviour which may appear sufficiently coherent to human users for the latter to attribute over-arching personality and individuality to them. But one of the most significant lessons that one can draw from observing the interaction between worshippers and their divinities is that the attribution of a specific identity and particular character to a deity is not necessarily dependent on its displaying a strong coherence of behaviour. On the contrary, most divinities behave with their worshippers with versatility and unpredictability. But the consequence of this is to deepen rather than obfuscate the intensity of the relationship, the logic of which is based on the human acknowledgement of and will to manage this unpredictability in a way that makes sense to all involved. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 13, 917-933 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2007</page><page sequence="12">928 DENIS VIDAL Moreover, such unpredictability may remind us of the troublesome finding of Joseph Weizenbaum in the famous experiment he orchestrated with a computer program called Eliza in 1963 at MIT. Weizenbaum got people to communicate to Eliza about their problems and was shocked to find that despite the stereotypical formulaic responses the computer gave, people thought they were communicating with a real psychiatrist (Weizenbaum 1976). What Rodney Brooks concludes from this episode is that 'Weizenbaum was fleeing from the notion that humans were no more than machines' (2002: 167). But it is possible to draw a different conclusion from this experiment which should not surprise any anthropologist working on divination, that is, that the intensity and quality of a dialogue do not necessarily depend on its coher- ence and/or on the appropriateness of the answers given by one or other of the interlocutors (see Zeitlyn 199o). This is a crucial point which fits the broader general argument of this article that sub-anthropomorphic features and a lack of obvious intentionality can effectively enhance, rather than impede, high levels of social co-operation in certain conditions and circumstances. Ontological uncertainties Given that I was a foreigner from a different cultural background, few local people expected me to 'believe' automatically in the existence of the local divinities, but most of them nevertheless expected that I would behave in front of the local gods as if I 'believed' in them. As I mentioned before, I sometimes interviewed the divinities directly (via their mediums) at the suggestion of my informants. And in such circum- stances it would have been inconceivable for me to interact with the mediums as if I were speaking with ordinary persons. Similarly, I learned to interpret the movements of the raths as well as anyone else and to decipher in this manner the answers of the divinities as well as their states of mind. Neither did I treat these mobile images as if they were mere everyday objects. The sorts of interactions that people may have with mediums or raths does not in fact correspond to the types of interaction people normally have either with 'persons' or material 'objects'. It is undoubtedly a form of social interaction but it obeys a very specific logic. On the one hand, one quickly learns to behave with local divinities more or less in the same way as one would with a local leader. On the other hand, this does not mean that the ontological status of the deities is necessarily so clear. On the contrary, what it seems to demonstrate is the incredible ease with which humans can, under the right circumstances, enter into social interac- tion with enigmatic 'entities' whose ontological status remains unclear throughout the encounter. More importantly, I quickly discovered that I was not the only one who greeted such entities with a certain level of perplexity. As a matter of fact, many local people seemed to share similar feelings in relation to these sorts of religious manifes- tations. This was true not only of the Westernized local elites, but also of a number of traditionally religious persons who did not hesitate to express their doubts about the exact nature of such rituals. Some of them would even suggest, either explicitly or implicitly, that the rituals were really an ingenious pedagogical tool whose real finality aimed at facilitating faith amongst the simple-minded. But such interpretations did not prevent these people from behaving with the deities in exactly the same way as everyone else and with the same apparent fervour when the divinities manifested themselves, either through the trances of the mediums or through the movements of their mobile images. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 13, 917-933 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2007</page><page sequence="13">DENIS VIDAL 929 One could still object, perhaps, that the ontological and teleological difference between robots and gods is such that one cannot seriously compare the logic of their respective interactions with people. After all, robots remain the result of a process of engineering and are acknowledged as such, whereas the local divinities of the Himalayas are an entirely different sort of entity. Such a methodological objection is, however, only valid if one compares the ontological status of robots and local divinities independently of their social and ritual contexts. But once ritual circumstances are taken into account, we found that when local worshippers are confronted with their gods during rituals, they remain anxious to know whether these really are 'independent' manifestations of the gods or whether they are a complex form of simulation. Such interrogation is so explicit that they have even developed a number of ritualized ways by which to check the validity of what they are seeing when a medium performs or a rath moves. Keeping this in mind, one may legitimately argue that the sort of onto- logical uncertainty which underpins such interactions is effectively comparable with the uncertainty expressed in a very different context when people encounter robots or other sophisticated machines and artefacts. From sub-anthropomorphism to allomorphism For many roboticists as well as for the general public, one of the most fascinating questions is to understand what sort of ontological status one should grant to sociable robots, supposing that such machines could manifest the sort of behaviour generally identified as intentionality and could express what appear to be 'genuine' emotions (as in Stanley Kubrick's prophetic film 2ooi: a space odyssey). However, such a question is not only perplexing from a methodological or ontological perspective; it also raises deep anxieties and more than a few ethical questions (Breton 1995; Kaplan 2005). But if one accepts the comparison that I have attempted here between the new generation of robots and the local divinities of Himachal Pradesh, one may reconsider this question from a slightly different perspective. As we have already seen, the explicit aim of some of the best teams of roboticists nowadays is to develop robots which can be considered not only as a particularly elaborate form of tool, but also as a 'social' partner in the full sense of the term. There is, however, an implicit presupposition at the basis of this project that in order to attain such an aim, it will be necessary to conceive of and build a robot whose behaviour is effectively closer to that of a living being (and preferably eventually a human being) than any of the existing machines so far developed. However, such a quest combines a teleological perspective with an anthropocentric one. It is teleological because it presupposes that it is mostly by anticipating the future that one will be able to conceive the notion of an artificial creature capable of repli- cating some of the most characteristic faculties of a human being. But it is anthropo- centric because most roboticists presuppose that the implicit aim of the exercise is to build a robot capable of interacting with human beings in a manner that would not be fundamentally different from the sorts of relationship humans establish with each other (Breazeal 2004; Brooks 2002). However, if one takes stock of the high degree of sociability attained by the Himalayan divinities described above, one may reconsider the question in a different light. What characterizes the interaction between the local divinities and their worshippers is the variety of 'anthropomorphic' features that define the nature of the Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 13, 917-933 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2007</page><page sequence="14">930 DENIS VIDAL relationship. But what is interesting is that anthropomorphism does not imply here any identification between divinities and human beings. As we have seen, the whole inter- action is orchestrated in such a way as to minimize any possibility of confusion from this point of view. Contrary also to what is commonly known but also easily forgotten, religious traditions and religious rituals are rarely based on the cultivation of quintes- sentially human cognitive faculties. Rather, in many cases, they are associated with what I have identified as 'sub-anthropomorphism'. But whilst in the field of robotics, cogni- tive failures are considered the regrettable consequence of limitations in technology, in the case of the divinities of the Himalayas, like in many other religions, 'sub- anthropomorphic' features are deliberately researched as powerful devices by which the presence of the divinity is indicated and revered. A first methodological conclusion, then, is that one does not always need to build technologically sophisticated devices in order to attain a high degree of social co-operation between human beings and 'artificial' creatures. Social interactions between gods and human beings in the Himalayas show that very simple artefacts can trigger a very high degree of social co-operation. And one should also notice that in spite of strong anthropomorphic features, such co-operation is also independent of any illusory identification between artefacts and human beings. But it is also true that where interaction is supposed to exist between the gods and their worshippers, there always remains a strong element of uncertainty which cannot easily be dismissed concerning the exact ontological nature of the hybrid arrangement by which the divinity's presence is made manifest. It is precisely the same sort of ontological uncer- tainty that one finds expressed in the field of robotics. And this is also why robots both fascinate and worry the general public. This raises the broader anthropological question of whether the intensity of the relationship which may exist with artificial (or semi-artifical) entities in very diverse circumstances is not directly linked to the degree of uncertainty concerning their exact ontological status, knowing that such uncertainty is often triggered itself by the difficulty of asserting the degree of intentionality which may be attributed to them. Obviously the social interaction which takes place within the frame of the rituals that I have described here was associated with a very specific context; but what I would like to suggest is that if this sort of interaction is analysed from a purely phenom- enological point of view, the observations outlined here may well have anthropologi- cal validity which goes far beyond the fields of religious studies. In particular, they may encourage us to reconsider from a comparative perspective the systematic uses which are often made of 'sub-anthropomorphic' features in diverse cultures (includ- ing our own) in order to trigger new modes of communication involving human beings and 'other' types of creatures (whether gods or robots). In this sense these findings may have methodological consequences both for robotics and for social anthropology. NOTES I want to think particularly Maurice Bloch, Frederic Kaplan, Carlo Severi, Emma Tarlo, and the partici- pants of the workshop 'Histoire et pratique des effets speciaux', organized at the Maison Frangaise d'Oxford (5-6 November 2004) for commenting on and discussing this article with me. I am particularly grateful to Frederic Kaplan, who introduced me to his fascinating work as an engineer, a researcher, and an expert roboticist, to Emma Tarlo, who rescued some of my English, and to the anonymous referees who obliged me to rethink parts of this text.

In this first paradigm, the human views the robot as a device that is used to perform a task ... - Robots as cyborg extension: In the second paradigm, the robot is physically merged with the human to the extent that the person accepts it as an integral part of his/her body ... - Robots as avatar: In this third paradigm, a person projects him/herself through the robot to remotely communicate with others (the next best thing to being there) ... - Robot as partner: In this last paradigm, a person collaborates with the robot in a social manner as a person would with a teammate ... (Breazeal &amp; Brooks 2005: 275-6). 2 The first international conference entirely dedicated to this domain - the '200oo6 Conference on Human- Robot Interaction' - was held in Salt Lake City, Utah, 2-3 March 2006. 3 For various descriptions of these cults, see Berti (2001), Sax (200oo6), Vidal (1981; 1987; 1989a; 1989b; 200oo6a), and for a general description and analysis of popular Hinduism, see Fuller (2004). 4 For examples of it, see Berti (2001: 163-9). 5 For an exception, however, see Ann Foerst, who worked for some time in Brooks' laboratory and who tries to reconcile robotics with theology (Foerst 2005). 6 One could be then tempted to interpret such ability in purely cultural terms, knowing, for example, that children are socialized in such a way that they learn (by the ways of games, in particular) how to to interpret such movements from a very young age. This is well shown in a film by Peter Sutherland, who filmed local children playing with small replicas of the mobile forms of the local divinities. But one should also take into account the fact that an outsider can learn quickly and easily as well how to interpret such movements with real accuracy. REFERENCES ASADA, M., K.F. MACDORMAN, H.
