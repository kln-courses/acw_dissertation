The Neural Ecology of Consciousness and Healing (Michael Winkelman, Bergin and Garvey, 2000) Reviewed by Richard J. Castillo (Division of Social Sciences, University of Hawai' i, West Oahu) The neurophenomenological approach to consciousness is becoming increasingly important. This approach combines cognitive neuroscience with transpersonal psychology and the anthropology of consciousness. This includes phenomenological studies of experiences transcending personal consciousness coming from Western contemplative and Eastern meditative and shamanistic traditions. This approach is gaining importance because of the new brain imaging technologies. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), PET (positron emission tomography), and SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) are providing information about the structure and functions of the brain that has never been available before. In contrast to earlier behaviorist models of psychological research which were strongly biased against the study of consciousness, the new neuroimaging methods have placed consciousness front-and-center as a topic for psychological and neuropsychological research. Michael Winkelman's (2000) book, Shamanism: The Neural Ecology of Consciousness and Healing is a welcome contribution to the discussion coming from the anthropology of consciousness. The anthropology of consciousness primarily concerns itself with cross-cultural studies of shamanistic states of consciousness, psychology of healing, psychopathology, ritual states of consciousness, trance, dissociation, and meditation. These are sometimes collectively referred to as ASC (altered states of consciousness). This area of research has been somewhat marginalized for many years from the mainstream of cultural and even psychological anthropology because of the reliance on phenomenological methods of inquiry. Data about altered states of consciousness were not seen as reliable by many anthropologists and most psychologists because of their subjective nature. However, with the new neuroimaging technologies, altered states of consciousness are now objects for empirical research in the laboratory. Phenomenological reports of ASC are now being validated by neuroimaging studies which are able to identify the neurophysiological processes associated with specific states of consciousness. The neurophenomenological approach is revolutionizing the way researchers think about the mind and the brain, and the relationship between the two. Prior to the advent of the latest neuroimaging methods, proponents of the neurophenomenological approach relied primarily on EEG (electroencephalograph) studies to inform them about the workings of the brain during ASC. However, compared to the new technologies, the EEG is a crude instrument which cannot adequately illuminate the inner pathways of the brain as messages are being sent from one part of the brain to another. This is precisely what the new technologies are able to do. Unfortunately, Winkelman's (2000) book does not take into account any of the findings of the new neuroimaging studies. This is the central limitation of the book. Winkelman provides an excellent summary of the older EEG findings and makes reasoned conclusions about the brain based on those findings. However, those conclusions are not supported by the latest neuroimaging studies. For example, Winkelman concludes that shamanistic healing practices produce a limbic-cortical integration in the brain. He states: Shamanistic healing practices achieve this integration by physically stimulating systemic brain- wave-discharge patterns that activate affects, memories, attachments, and other psychodynamic processes of the paleomammalian brain. . . . Shamanism represents adaptive potentials, an enhanced operation of consciousness derived from integrative brain functioning. . . . These potentials provided the basis for the evolution of synthetic symbolic awareness in early evolutionary periods of modem Homo sapiens, providing a basis for human development in the mythological systems representing self, mind, other, and consciousness. This is exemplified in the soul journey and in guardian spirits, which constitute forms of self- obj edification and role taking that expand human sociocognitive and intrapsychic dynamics, (pp. xiii-xiv) 101</page><page sequence="2">Journal of Ritual Studies 18 (1) 2004 Review Forum The gross information available from EEG studies has led Winkelman to conclude that there is a kind of single integrated state of consciousness which makes possible the various shamanistic phenomena of ASC including healing and trance states. However, new brain imaging studies do not support this conclusion. For example, Hofbauer et al (2001) using PET found that subjects were able to decrease the experience of pain following hypnotic suggestion using two separate brain mechanisms. Hypnotized subjects under experimentally produced pain were given the suggestion that the pain intensity would decrease. These subjects reported decreased pain intensity and PET showed significant decreases in pain-evoked activity in the somatosensory association center in the superior parietal lobe. Other hypnotized subjects were given the suggestion that pain unpleasantness (emotional content) would decrease independent of pain intensity. In these subjects PET showed a decrease in activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, which is part of the limbic system, the area of the brain associated with the experience of emotions. Pain intensity was unchanged, but the subjects ceased to care about it. Rather than Winkelman's notion of "integration," Hofbauer et al concluded that both of these pain reduction mechanisms in the brain were separate types of dissociation. Dissociation is the dis-integration of functions of the nervous systems which are normally integrated, for example, blocking the experience of pain from consciousness. Brain imaging studies indicate that dissociation is dependent on activity in the prefrontal cortex which sends inhibitory signals to various parts of the brain blocking neural messages from reaching association centers, thereby blocking information from reaching consciousness. At its greatest extent the neural blockage can even result in a complete shut down of cognitive processes. For example, Newberg and d'Aquili (2001) found using SPECT that a form of meditation they termed "passive" trance is based on the conscious intention to clear all thought, emotions, and perceptions from consciousness. This was accomplished by the right attention association area in the prefrontal cotex focusing attention away from all sensory and cognitive input. The attention association area, via the thalamus, caused the hippocampus to inhibit neural input to the somatosensory association area in the superior parietal region, causing increasing deafferentation or neural blockage. As neural blockage continued, the deafferented somatosensory area sent signals to the hypothalamus, which then signaled the attention association area. They concluded that a reverberating circuit was established which strengthened the neural connections enabling the attention area to completely shield consciousness from sensory or cognitive input. This in turn maximized neural blockage to the somatosensory area in the superior parietal region. They described this as a shutdown of neural input. The resulting subjective experience was a loss of self and a loss of environmental context. The cognitive processes were, in effect, turned off. This is not an integration, but dissociation, a dis- integration of the normal functions of the nervous system. It appears from brain imaging studies that dissociation is initiated by activity in the prefrontal cortex, which is the attention association area of the brain, and center of the executive functions of the nervous system. Winkelman (2000) also concludes that the shamanistic integrative state of consciouusness is responsible for a sense of "the other" in awareness which is the basis of animism, the experience of guardian spirits, soul journeying, gods and demons, and ultimately the origin of religion. He concedes that many shamans enter their vocation through an initiatory crisis or brief psychosis characterized by hallucinatory experience. By weathering the crisis and taming the demons the individual is able to control the spirits and make them his allies in shamanistic practice. However, brain imaging studies of hallucinatory experience again point to dissociation. For example, findings indicate that some regions of the auditory and speech processing pathways are abnormally inactivated during auditory hallucinations, and other regions are abnormally activated. Shergill et al (2000) using fMRI concluded that auditory hallucinations arise through the disruption of normal cognitive processes, such as the monitoring of one's own verbal thoughts. This disruption is hypothesized to be caused by a loss of the normal functional connectivity between brain regions that underlie the experience of inner speech. Their Endings indicated that there was a lack of the normal correlation between inferior frontal and temporal activity in psychiatric patients prone to hearing voices. According to Gomez (2002; Gomez and Lopera 1999), abnormal inactivation in the frontal and temporal lobes interrupts the functional connectivity of the usual network and allows abnormal activation of other 102</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Ritual Studies 18 (lì 2004 Review Forum regions. This eventually generates independent neural networks. Gomez hypothesizes that independent networks are activated during auditory hallucinations which produce a "division of the consciousness or the will." These hypothetical independent neural networks may be the neurophysiological basis of experiences of spirits, gods, demons, angels, and various "others" appearing in consciousness. Rather than Winkelman's (2000) focus on the paleomammalian brain, the new brain imaging studies indicate that the prefrontal cortex is the area of the brain most responsible for ASC. This is significant for theories of evolution of modern human consciousness. Winkelman rightly emphasizes the importance of shamanism in the development of the flexibility of human consciousness enabling the evolution of animism, anthropomorphism, totemism, and mimetic thinking in early Homo sapiens. The development of modern human consicousness was probably in many ways dependent on the early shamans who were the first explorers in alternative states of consciousness. Significantly, there is no evidence of any religious or artistic activities in Homo neanderthalensis or Homo heidelbergensis. Moreover, there is no reason to believe that the paleomammalian part of the brain differed in any way between Homo sapiens and these two earlier species. If the paleomammalian brain was responsible for shamanistic states of consciousness, then shamanism should have evolved as early as 500,000 years ago with the appearance of Homo heidelbergensis, a species with a brain just as large, if not slightly larger than Homo sapiens (Stringer and McKie 1996). The great cognitive flexibility and creativity we associate with modern humans only appears in the archeological record about 70,000 years ago in Africa, and about 40,000 years ago in Europe (Lewin 1998). The origins of modern human consciousness are no doubt based on the biology of the brain as Winkelman (2000) concludes. However, in order to find those origins we must focus on the differences in brain structure between Homo sapiens and the species from which we evolved, Homo heidelbergensis. The shape of the brain in both Homo heidelbergensis and Homo neanderthalensis was quite different from that of Homo sapiens. In the earlier species, the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes were much larger than modern humans, and the frontal lobes (especially the prefrontal cortex) were much smaller. This made for a skull shape that was smaller at the front, flat on top, bulged at the sides, and protruding at the rear, compared to the skulls of Homo sapiens (Allman 2000; Lewin 1998). The temporal, parietal and occipital lobes are the areas of the brain primarily associated with processing sensory information. The very large brain mass devoted to these sensory processing areas suggests that the earlier species may have had superior senses compared to Homo sapiens, but did not have our cognitive flexibility, creativity, or religious sensibility. Based on brain imaging studies indicating the importance of the prefrontal cortex in the production of ASC, some informed speculations can be made about the origins of Homo sapiens. The most noticeable thing about Homo sapiens is the different shape of the brain. In early Homo sapiens, average brain size was the same as Homo heidelbergensis, but the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes all became much smaller, while the frontal lobes (particularly the prefrontal cortex) became much larger (Lewin 1998). Up until the evolution of Homo sapiens the hominid brain had kept its same basic shape while getting progressively larger (Allman 2000). Apparently, the evolution of the Homo sapiens brain was the result of a completely different evolutionary process from earlier species. I speculate that the shape of the Homo sapiens brain evolved as a result of pedomorphism (taking a juvenile form). Pedomorphism in Homo sapiens is visible in the body as well as the skull, but is especially noticeable in the shape of the skull. The changes in the body involved a more gracile shape and a narrowing of the bones. In the Homo sapiens skull, cranial bones became thinner, and there was a massive reorganization of the proportions of the head with the overall shape becoming rounded. This meant a shortening of the cranial vault, flattening of the face, and a dramatic raising of the forehead (Lewin 1 998). The pedomorphy of the Homo sapiens skull is evident when comparing it to the skulls of juvenile apes. The skulls of juvenile apes are rounded like Homo sapiens. Only as they develop do ape skulls gain their adult shape with a flat top, protruding rear, and a massive chinless jaw sticking out from the face (Allman 2000). It is likely that all juvenile hominids had round-shaped heads just as adult Homo sapiens do. I suggest that the first Homo sapiens adults could have looked similar to Homo heidelbergensis juveniles. 103</page><page sequence="4">Journal of Ritual Studies 18 (1) 2004 Review Forum The first Homo sapiens may have been juvenile versions of Homo heidelbergensis , presumably with Homo sapiens becoming reproductive at a juvenile stage of development. This kind of pedomorphism happens occasionally in nature, usually as a result of predatory pressures. Modern human hunting has clearly led to pedomorphism in various fish species. Human hunting is also suspected in the pedomorphing of several large mammals during the past 12,000 years. This happens when hunting is focused on the largest individuals, usually males, leaving the females and juveniles to reproduce. If a food species is consistently managed in this way it results in selection for pedomorphs, who cease to grow at a juvenile stage in order to reproduce before being taken by hunters (Flannery 2001). One possible explanation for pedomorphism in Homo sapiens is human hunting and cannibalism. Homo heidelbergensis were highly intelligent with brains equal in size or slightly larger than modern day humans. If they hunted their fellow humans for food, no doubt they could have understood the prudent management of this resource by only taking large males, just as human hunters do today. If this was done consistently over some time, it could have produced a pedomorphic species of humans. This juvenile- looking species would have been smaller, with round-shaped heads, and gracile bodies. There is fossil evidence of cannibalism in early Homo heidelbergensis and Homo neanderthalensis , as well as evidence of dietary cannibalism in Homo sapiens (White 2001). I speculate that the eventual evolutionary success of Homo sapiens was made possible by new mental abilities inherent in the pedomorphic shape of the brain, particularly the large new prefrontal cortex. Brain imaging studies indicate that the shape of the modern human brain is responsible for the experience of ASC. The large new prefrontal cortex in Homo sapiens may have allowed humans to experience shamanistic states of consciousness for the first time in evolutionary history. It could have been this ability to experience spirits which made possible the development of organized religion, including charismatic leadership, group bonding through religious ritual, fanaticism, religious martyrdom, and holy war. The evolution of religion may have been the advantage Homo sapiens needed to replace both Homo heidelbergensis and Homo neanderthalensis. This was likely made possible, not by the paleomammalian brain (which we share with these earlier species), but by a large new prefrontal cortex, possibly shaped by pedomorphism.
