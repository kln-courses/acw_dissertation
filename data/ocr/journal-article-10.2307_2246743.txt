<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nature and Thought: An Introduction to a Natural Philosophy. By ST. GEORGE MIVART. London: Kegan Paul, 1882. Pt. 261. Mr. Mivart presents us with a series of dialogues between F., a mild, easy and rather simple youth, who has played at scepti- cism and is now in a state of unstable equilibrium, ready for conversion, and M., his "guide, philosopher, and friend," who seeks to lead him into that outer court of the temple of Catholic Truth, Natural Theology or "Philosophy ". This is sufficient indication of the pith and purpose of the book and, without saying anything about its literary setting, it may be allowed to pass on to an appreciation of the author's main positions, and his way of defending them. His essential theses are four :--(1) The possibility of absolute certainty; (2) A known world-in-itself, the postulate of science; (3) The possession of absolute, necessary and universal truths, which lifts the origin and nature of man above the plane of "Nature," and makes a supernatural anthro- pology possible; (4) The possibility of theology, theodicy, and</page><page sequence="2">CRITICAL NOTICES. 285 supernatural religion and morality. His method of philosophy is an a.malgam of common-sense and psychology, making "use of all our means of information," and " justifying the spontaneous natural dictates of man's uncultured reason by philosophical analysis ". A system of propositions-each self-evident, and all coherent-is true, and such a one is this " natural philosophy ". The challenge may very well be accepted; and both his principles severally and their harmony be called in question. (1) We attain "absolute certainty " by being furnished with "intellectual intuition," a faculty of positive and potent direct insight, and no " impotence" or process of reflection-actus not actio, an instantaneous glance and not an inquiry. " Whatever is evident is true" and absolutely certain, a doctrine identical with Descartes' appeal to clear ideas, although that is pre- viously condemned on p. 19, and Descartes is included amongst those philosophers whose analyses of consciousness have been incomplete and one-sided. That is " evident" which is an object of "intellectual intuition," and such objects constitute "objec- tive evidence," which by coinciding with " subjective evidence," or the feeling of assurance and certitude, give " absolute cer- tainty ". These objects, again, are a kind of occult qualities called "objective concepts," which inhere in the things them- selves, and swing in meaning between Scholastic realism and Platonic idealism, so that it is difficult to say decidedly whether Mr. Mivart takes them to be ante res, in rebus, or inter res, or what else the res are themselves. This way of seeing percepts, con- cepts, and realities double, looks very like seeking the ground of the ground, the rationale of the irrational, and the reason of the faith that all reasoning presupposes. Surely the faculty and its objects are both pure assumptions, and quite gratuitous after the author has said, "self-conscious reflective thought is then our ultimate and absolute criterion," where he appears to accept Reflection as the critic, and ultimate inexpugnability on reflection as the criterion of truth; and yet he almost immediately after- wards rejects every kind of reflective test in favour of intuition, justifies the high value he attaches to the testimony of language and common-sense, because of the superior clearness and distinct- ness of direct thought (i.e., intuition), of which he considers them products, and subjects Mr. Spencer's universal postulate to a special criticism, which takes the form of the sophism of the false infinite, thus, after Mr. Balfour :-A thing is true because we cannot conceive the' opposite; but how do we know that this proposition is true? by the same warrant, because we cannot conceive the opposite; and so on ad infiniturm. Unfortunately, it can be shown, by the same sophistical reflection back into an illusory infinite, that self-consciousness can never have begun to be, since we cannot know without knowing that we know, and so ad infinitum. But this is not serious criticism worthy of the conciliator of common-sense. Another way the author has of</page><page sequence="3">288 CRITICAL NOTICE,S. meeting Mr. Spencer's test of inconceivability, is by affirming the conceivability of the unimaginable. " I cannot imagine my own annihilation, but I can conceive it !" he says, not observing that in conceiving it, "II" remain and am. Yet when it is said that " conception is not tied down to experience, though imagination is," ofne can well believe it, if one has already accepted the " objec- tive concepts"; but it will be incredible, if one sees that concepts are only images in outline waiting to be filled in. Throughout this dialogue on certainty, it may be noted that " objective " is taken to mean " noumenal,"' objects are confounded with things- in-themselves, and such words as "being," "existence," and "things" are freely used, but left undefined, as if we all knew and -were agreed on what they meant. By a curious argument, memory is made to witness to our knowledge of noumena or absolute certainties; for " it enables you and me to know events that once really happened, and to recollect objects separated by more than a quarter of a century's interval from our present con- sciousness. We thus know real existences, which are objective or external to us, but of which our senses can tell us nothing." But did they tell us nothing? And what are these "objects" Cnd "events" in memory but representations of what was once presented in sense-perception ? Memory has not carried us beyond the circle of phenomena. (2) We are thus brought to the edge of the second affirmation. that we can have a certain knowledge of "a.n external world eoisting independently of ourselves such as physical science pos- tttlates ". By this an unphenomenal world is meant, and the relativity of knowledge is denied, for we have absolute knowledge of the world as it absolutely is. The world is representative, but to represent means to "make the thing present," and so we have direct vision of the world-in-itself with all its absolute primary qtialities, and even its secondary qualities, like " objective sound," and with an immediate assurance of its truth and being by intui- tion. What we perceive without or against our will gives us this world-in-itself; as if the presence or absence of the feeling of effort in the complex of a percept made it more&amp;or less than a phenomenon. For the most part, Berkeley is met with the mere cotnter-assertion of the noumenal existence of phenomena, as " unthinking substances, and things-in-themselves," but the author also uses against him the distinction between conception and ima- gination, where he says "I cannot imagine a thing existing 'unperceived by anybody, but I certainly can conceive it," and so we have "a.n apprehension of external objective conditions of real independent bodies," unlike the sensations a.nd relations between sensations, on occasion of which we intuite them! Ad- mitting that Berkeley is irrefutable, so far as ordinary experience goes, if the position of Locke and Kant is granted that our per- cepts are compounded of " our own ideas and sensations only," Mr. Mivart simply contents himself with denying that premiss,</page><page sequence="4">CRITICAL NOTICES. 287 and begs the question. But even. allowing it, he thinks that phenomenalism is not so compatible with scientiftc experience and thought, for these require us to believe that " the numbers, shapes, solidities, and motions of bodies," and even their secondary quali- ties, " really exist objectively i.e., absolutely and in them; and so science postulates unphenomenal phenomena, and there is no difficulty about it, for, even admitting Lewes's " greeting of the spirit," our intellect has power to subtract this subjective element, and concentrate its gaze on the pure noumenal residuum. It is not easy to see why Mr. Mivart sets his face against a mitigated idealism like Berkeley's or Ferrier's, which offers him the most plausible ground for postulating a Universal Consciousness, unless it is the fear of consequences and logical issues. (3) The third position is carried by a tour de force. It is only necessary to posit an " innate power" and faculty of pure intel- lectual apprehension of absolutely necessary and universal truths, seen to be such by their own evidence. It is not that universality in experience gives the feeling of necessity, as wvhen poor F. says of such invariables, " They certainly do strike me as true for all the times and places I can think of "; although Mr. Mivart admits that association a.nd "custom" may be the divinely appointed occasion of our apprehending absolute truths. Causality or " influx" is one of these truths, known by spontaneous intellectual intuition; and this without any sense-mediation in the case of " the inflow of the influence of motives upon our will ". " Good- ness" is another, sui generis, absolute, self-justified, underived, and intuitively discerned. So too " oughtness" is "unanalysable," and "moral " means inexplicable. Pleasure, interest, happiness, and "moral sentiment " are at the most mere accessories or coincidents. Possessed of such absolute cognitions as these and their issue, language, man has his origin and nature secured against Darwinian and evolutionary assaults. Here Mr. Mivart is very positive about what animals can and cannot do (pp. 165-6), and about Darwinism, which is a "superstition" reposing neither on reason nor evidence, but on "ignorance of what reason is, and, above ll, ignorance of the meaning of the word ' goodness'," and so Darwin's derivation of man and his speech and morals falls to pieces, chiefly because he could not define the undefinable. But, if possible, the Agnostic doctrine of relativity is more " ex- tremely pernicious" and "foolish". (4) We have now a supernatural anthropology in ovo, and are prepared for the last position; and it only remains, as a prelimi- nary, to establish the soul. This is done by hypostasising the original synthetical unity of apperception, as soul, the substantial form or principle of individuation, in a way shown to be illegiti- mate by Kant a century ago (p. 185). It is an-immanent principle, an immaterial entity that acts, directs, controls, unifies, organises (p. 189), and yet it is not " a numerically distinct something," is only the living body from a dynamical point of view, the sum of</page><page sequence="5">288 CRITICAL NOTICES. its energies (p. 188), and apart from the body " an abstraction" ! It is, in fact, a bundle of these and other contradictions. All living plants and animals are souls, and there is no hiatus except two-, one between the unliving and life, the other between the highest merely animal life and man. Such things "we know most intimately," and it is enough to simply affirm them. The human soul is immortal, because "in a sense" out of space and time (p. 225), and transcends while it pervades the body, for (p. 227) intellect and will are not immersed in the body, and are without organ! All this appears as pure free play of the imagina- tion, without a particle of real proof, but it is a postulate of the theodicy, which requires a future life of rewards and punishments (p. 229); and there is yet another proof of immortality, namely, the soul's "power of intervening as a free cause, and modifying the whole chain of physical causation by a quasi-supernatural act of volition ". This doctrine of Free-will is also a proper propm- deutic to the doctrine of miracle, prayer, providence, and revela- tion (p. 223); free-will being itself a kind of miracle, for "my free volition is a truly uncaused action which intervenes in the course of physical causation, and alters the whole future of the universe for all eternity". Mr. Mivart brings forward nothing new in defence of free-will, which he finds in the usual way, by confounding the sense of incompulsion we sometimes have with an intuition of absolute origination we never have, and thus get- ting " a new force entirely distinct from the force of the motives," and yet-strange to say-acting " in conformity to our perception of duty " ! In building up his theology, Mr. Mivart proceeds as if the Transcendental Dialectic had never been written. The world may be eternal, but it may be taken as one well-ordered whole, and then requires a cause of harmony. He does not show how we can think the totality, and assumes without proof that cosmos is a fact and a contingent fact, whereas chaos may be equally a fact, and neither may be absolute, while both may be eternal and necessary correlatives. When he is thinking of the world as a machine, it requires a transcendent deus ex machind', but at other times he is driven on to think of an immanent and pervading animna mundi (p. 200). The proverb, Nemo dat quod non habet, provides the self-existent absolute cause with abundant attributes, and the process of clothing culminates in anthropomorphic im- personation; while in another place "de-anthropomorphisation" goes on till even " existence" cannot be predicated unambiguously (p. 206). The author is an optimist because he is a believer in God, and he is a believer in God because he is an optimist (pp. 208-9). By another circulus, the divine goodness proves the future life, which itself depends on the divine goodness (pp. 244, &amp;c.) The theodicy advances by minimising pain and evil in a way that is ungenerous when we are not the sufferers, by making good come out of and depend on evil, a manufacture that fails where there is no future life for the creatures, and by many</page><page sequence="6">CRITICAL NOTICES. 289 appeals ad ignoranztiam-to the possibly stubborn nature of things, " the range of objective contradiction" or essential absurdity possibly limiting omnipotence, the inscrutability of the divine purposes, the "vast scheme of infinite beneficence" past finding out, the possible existence of intrinsic or "objective beauty" where men find ugliness, and so forth. In fine, theology and theodicy are the offspring of desire-," a desire that all that is highest and best-ideal perfection-should really exist," and accordingly no one " could dare to be impartial, unless he would dare to be voluntarily and deliberately as impious as absurd".
