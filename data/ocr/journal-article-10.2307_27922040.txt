<plain_text><page sequence="1">POEMS Ramon Del Castillo Denver, Colorado Anthropomorphic Splanglish It's me again, alive and well coming to haunt your society. I was asleep in my graveyard but was awakened by the howling noises of a discontented people. Remember me? I have been around since human beings have learned how to babble how to stutter and to talk. You are right. I AM THE BASTARD LANGUAGE, caught in the middle of man's insecurities his violent tendencies his ignorance and his need to control. Tii sabes?I created other men in transition who are marginal unable to communicate in any form. They viciously steal syllables .and borrow.. sounds from other languages so, they too, can mumble about their discontentedness. I will always be around for as long as there is free air and men continue to stare with hate and envy unwilling to compromise. I am the shadow of Cuauht?moc who died defending his N?huatl language. He watched it seep out of his body mezclada con otras lenguas y culturas in the valley of Tenochtitl?n. He is our ancestor and he sends me with the task of preserving nuestra cultura. I am the burning desire. I am the catalyst for 193</page><page sequence="2">future movements. I am you. la semilla de revoluci?n. Pero, necesito agua y amor y cari?o to grow the flowers of equality and justicia. Yes. I am the bastard. But I am only the reflection of you.. .and your fears. CALL ME WHAT YOU WISH! I AM HERE TO STAY I AM THE PRESERVER OF YOUR ESPIRITU! AYUDAME!!! 194</page></plain_text>
