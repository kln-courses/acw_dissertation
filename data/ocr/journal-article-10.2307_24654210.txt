<plain_text><page sequence="1">Heidegger and the New Image* of Science THEODORE KISIEL Northern Illinois University Heidegger and science? To some, the combination undoubtedly still sounds strange and unlikely, let alone fruitful and worthy of extended consideration. What could we possibly expect to learn about the inner workings of science from a thinker singularly and almost monotonously concerned with the time-honored and now grandiose question of Being? In the words of one astute commentator: "On the longest day he ever lived, Heidegger could never be called a philosopher of science."1 And yet, those intimately acquainted with Heidegger's entire career can easily point to just such a day, and it must have been a long day indeed. For on July 27, 1915, the young Dr. Heidegger (age 25) held his inaugural lecture before the philosophical faculty at the University of Freiburg in order to obtain his venia legendi, the privilege to teach in the German university system, conceiving the lecture precisely as a logical epistemological examination of the concept of time in natural science and in historical science.2 'William J. Richardson, "Heidegger's Critique of Science," New Scholasticism XLII (1968) 511-536. But this opening sentence of the article is moderated by a concluding paragraph suggesting how a philosophy of science could be elaborated within a Heideggerian framework. 2This early lecture, "Der Zeitbegriff in der Geschichtswissenschaft," is now readily available in the collection of Heidegger's major works from the period 1914-16. Cf. Martin Heidegger, Fruhe Schriften (Frankfurt: Klostermann, 1972) pp. 355-375. This early lecture marks the high point of what I have called Heidegger's logical conception of science, as distinguished from his later existential and metaphysical conceptions. Cf, my essay, "On the Dimensions of a Phenomenology of Science in Husserl and the Young Dr. Heidegger, " Journal of the British Society for PhenomenologylN (1973) 217-234. 162</page><page sequence="2">Heidegger and the New Images of Science 163 True. But after all, it must also be granted that this was long before Heidegger became Heidegger, by achieving international notoriety as a philosopher of existence practically overnight in 1927 with the publication of Being and Time. And Being and Time is manifestly a philosophy of being and existence and not a philosophy of science. But the examination of existential phenomena in this magnum opus also includes reflections on an existential conception of science, distinct from his earlier logical conception, with a promise of a thorough-going interpretation of science as a positive mode of existence to be incorporated in the as-yet-unpublished2a Third Division of the First Part of the project. Instead, science appears in a less positive light in the Second Part of the Heideggerian project, the part entitled "the phenomenological destruction of the history of ontology" and later elaborated under the rubric of "overcoming metaphysics." This third approach to science can be labelled the "metaphysical" or "epochal" conception of science, inasmuch as modern science is seen as a terminal epoch in the long history of metaphysics now coming to its end in the planetary dominion of technology. Note that metaphysics here does not refer to an abstract academic discipline but rather to the prevailing presuppositions and concrete interpretation of reality which uniquely stamp an age, for example, in the institutions and attitudes which that age accepts as a matter of course. In this vein, Heidegger's latest statements - two letters to conferences on his thought in this country and the interview on German television on the occasion of his 80th birthday3 - make it clear that the present concretion of the question of Being is nothing less than the question of science and technology, insofar as the institutions and the attitudes they have provoked permeate the fabric of 20th century existence and thus indelibly mark the way we now live, move and have our being. In short, the question of Being now reads: What does it mean to be in a scientific-technological age? 2aThis is no longer quite accurate in view of the recent publication of the lecture course of 1927, in which philosophy itself is taken as the "science of being."

The juxtaposition sounds even more ambitious and diffuse than the thematic combination Science and Society, to which increasing attention is being devoted by a number of disciplines, including the philosophy of science. Indeed, it is difficult to think of a reflection on science more far-reaching than Heidegger's, for whom science and technology are the culmination and fulfillment of the destiny of several millenia of Western philosophy. Moreover, inasmuch as they are taken to be the mortal gasps of a tradition of metaphysics which Heidegger is striving to overcome, science and technology appear in such a negative light that some have accused Heidegger of being a reactionary romantic and even a neo-Luddite. Recall his most notorious pronouncement in this vein: "Science itself does not think."4 The adversary relationship which has over the decades developed between Heidegger and more scientifically-oriented philosophers perhaps finds its epitome in Rudolf Carnap's debunking of what he considers to be Heidegger's "pseudo-statements," statements like "Nothing itself nothings," which have become the stock examples of meaningless metaphysical statements still circulating in neo-positivist circles. Parenthetically, it is interesting to note that Carnap's critique, which appeared in the journal Erkenntnis in 1913, is entitled "Overcoming of Metaphysics through Logical Analysis of Language,"5 antedating by several years Heidegger's own adoption of the phrase "Overcoming of Metaphysics." Heidegger's response to such critiques is characteristically sweeping. For him, the linguistic standards of clarity, formal exactness and univocity adopted by logical positivism find their natural place in the history of metaphysics in the spirit of modernity, in which 1) truth is certainty, 2) reality is objectivity, and 3) rationality finds its model in a «Martin Heidegger, What is CaUed Thinking?, translated by Fred D. Wieck and J. Glenn Gray (New York: Harper and Row, 1968) p. 8. For an extended commentary on this remark, cf. my essay, "Science, Phenomenology, and the Thinking of Being," in Joseph J.

Heidegger thus seems to make unholy alliance with his worst enemies, the positivists, in accepting their image as the ultimate upshot of modern science. His broad historical perspective thus devolves upon an image of science oriented towards logic and the positive fact, which from the perspective of contemporary philosophy of science is now considered to be far too narrow. For the last decade or so has witnessed an anti positivist revolt of major proportions in the philosophy of science which has challenged the positivist image of science on each of the three scores named above and, moreover, has shifted the locus of the essence of science in a direction which appears quite amenable to the direction suggested by Heidegger's existential conception of science.7 Instead of a logical analysis of the theoretical products of science, the new philosophies of science rely more heavily on historical case studies of the actual process of science. As a result of this shift in approach, Anglo American philosophy now definitively reflects a wholesale overhaul of the positivistic treatment of science in terms of idealized formal systems mapping empirical data. The more historical image now views science as ongoing research in a changing problem-situation which is interpreted and resolved according to the resources of a particular historical and conceptual context. 'These three intertwining dimensions, which will serve as touchpoints of comparison in what follows, in the Heideggerian meditation ultimately lead back to the pre-Socratic roots of the Tree of metaphysics" and correspond respectively to those most elemental of Greek words, alethia, physics and logos.

Note first that it does not particularly mention "theory," "fact," or "method," which stood in the forefront of the positivistic image. The operative dimensions are rather 1) research or discovery, 2) the interrogative mood of a problem-situation, 3) the process of interpretation in a finite context, 4) which is a conceptual context or, more directly and simply put, a language. Finally, all of these dimensions are essentially pervaded by historical movement. Accodingly, the emphasis falls on the dynamis of truth in via rather than the stasis of truth once and for all, and on the holistic context rather than on an atomic objectivity. Consideration of the contextual process rather than the finished results of science suggests a more pragmatic and less syntactic and formal rationality, and, in view of the priority of the interrogative mood over the declarative mood, a more chiaroscuro and less clear and distinct rationality, more a finite sense of truth rather than the security of eternal verities. One is immediately reminded here of Heidegger's efforts to shift the locus of truth from the proposition to the existentially rooted question, in order to view the finalization of truth against the background of the origin of truth, a background which Heidegger considers to be the more original truth. The same reversal of orientation is strikingly evident in the new philosophies of science. By tracing the termination of the scientific process, finalized in the form of theoretical and observational statements, back to its most obscure origins in the problem-situation, the new approaches bring out the inseparable unity and reciprocal interplay of the "context of justification" with the "context of discovery" to the point of insisting that judicative verification must serve the interrogative demands of discovery. This reversal of the positivist stress on the truth of verification tends to be borne out by the culture of science as it is manifested in the attitudes of scientists, who are trained and conditioned to seek new discoveries, whose professional prestige hinges on just such inventiveness, who compete vehemently to be the first to solve the most current problems of their fields, who thus become involved in the numerous bitter disputes over the priority and independence of their discoveries. And nowhere is it more evident how truncated the positiviste' image was than in their attitude to the problem of scientific discovery, which they systematically excluded from any</page><page sequence="6">Heidegger and the New Images of Science 167 consideration whatsoever by the strategy of relegating it to the "waste basket" of "mere" psychology. According to this positivist view, discovery is a matter of intuition, strokes of genius, the workings of the unconscious and other such imponderables and therefore not a fit subject for logical minds. This most important dimension of scientific activity was thus left unexplained and accordingly left to the raconteurs of those fascinating and at once obfuscating anecdotes of discoveries made as if by "accident", and of illuminations that come from a magical "nowhere": Archimedes' bath, Newton's apple, Kekule's dream of the dancing serpents, Poincaré's step onto an omnibus, to name only some of the better-known. A narrow area of methodological rationality populated by secure results is thus sharply demarcated from a vast enveloping jungle constituting the irrationality of creativity, which is unceremoniously dispatched to the limbo of the non-science of science. Even the narrow realm of logically secured results, demarcated as science proper by positivism, soon proved to be a paper-thin substitute for the thick situation in which science actually takes place. The bifocal view of positivism stratifies the structure of science into a formal calculus governed by the stable laws of logic over against an independent world of fixed observations. Science proper is thus made to move in a split-level universe defined by the eternal poles of logic and fact. The time-honored metaphysical quest for stability and security thus reasserts itself in the world of science as portrayed by positivism, in spite of its loudly professed anti-metaphysical stance, now in the modern guise of a methodological subject coupling with an empirical object. Despite its reputed anti-metaphysical stance, positivism betrays its metaphysical vestiges by proclaiming bQth poles of its universe to be uncorrupted by becoming and change. In more epistemological terms, both formal and empirical levels are viewed as essentially uninterpreted, and interpretation becomes the act of the match maker who couples two virgins and brings them into a state of cohabitation. This is officiously executed by means of so-called "correspondence rules," "coordinating definitions," "bridge principles," or "rules of interpretation." Feigl's description of this scientific situation is particularly graphic: The postulate system of the formal calculus is like a free-floating balloon hovering over the earth of empirical facts, which must be anchored to the soil of experience and filled with empirical meaning by means of connecting tubes, which permit an "upward seepage of the empirical juice" of observational meaning to be pumped into the unvisualizable</page><page sequence="7">168 Theodore Kisiel theoretical terms, thereby investing them with a partial interpretation. Interpretation is thus a matter of filling the theoretical forms of a parade of blimps by a one-way capillary pumping action skyward from the earth. This has come to be known as the Capillary Model of meaning and interpretation.8 In order to develop this theory of interpretation and meaning, the efforts of the logical positivists inevitably turned to linguistic reform. In the spirit of clarity and distinction aimed at expunging all vestiges of metaphysical obfuscation from the language of science, they sought to extricate from ordinary language two very non-ordinary languages, 1) an ideal language purified according to the demands of mathematical logic and 2) a neutral observation language based on the ontology of phenomenalism. But decades of effort have not yielded anything like a satisfactorily neutral observation language and it soon became apparent that only a small part of science in its most advanced theoretical efforts even approached the high degree of formality demanded by mathematical logic. Recently, not only the possibility but even the desirability of these linguistic reforms for the philosophy of science have been challenged by old-timers like Carl Hempel as well as by the new upstarts, on the grounds that they constitute a ruthless abstraction from the complex reality of scientific theorizing, in which observation is always already theory-laden and formal algorithms are always ualready rich with meaning, charged with structural representations of phenomena."9 The two extremes which positivism sought to purify out of scientific practice are in practice never so pristine pure, but have all along been co-habitating on the sly, in an alliance which is not only not unholy but in fact the very source of the fertility of science. To separate the two extremes and to attempt to "purify" them only serves to remove science from the profound and comprehensive reality with which it has come in contact in its formulations. Purification would mean sterilization. Science finds its proper element not in the thin clarity of extremes sifted out by the misplaced «"New Philosophies of Science in the USA," pp. 142-4.

This recurring reference to the immerschon is what Heidegger would call the facticity of science.</page><page sequence="8">Heidegger and the New Images of Science 169 discreteness of logical positivism but in the already interpreted, conceptually organized context cultivated for science by a historical tradition which has been transmitted to it largely in and through the usages of ordinary language, in which theory and observation already correspond with one another in thç reality about which they speak. Explicit and formalized rules of correspondence are accordingly by and large unnecessary in scientific theorizing. It is therefore not surprising that they have been notoriously difficult to pinpoint. Instead of explicit rules bridging the chasm between formal and empirical levels, actual practice suggests more of a tacit process of mutual interpretation of a theory by its particulars and of particulars by their comprehensive theory in terms of the cues of the problem-situation to which they are addressed. The process can be described in terms of what the philological tradition has called the "hermeneutic circle," which cannot be construed as a vicious circle because it is ultimately not only logical but also and primarily ontological. For the spiral movement thus generated incessantly wends its way down toward the non-verbal frontiers of a verbally structured problem-situation, which in turn is always already understood according to the usages of ordinary language as well as being invested with the meanings developed by the tradition of the discipline in question. Ordinary language as well as scientific language thus always articulates the problem-situation, and solving the problem involves the ability to see the scientific linguistics of the problem in and through the ordinary language in which it is always couched. Recall the famous example of Eddington's elephant, a problem which is expeditiously solved if one knows how to translate it into the terms of the standard inclined-plane problem of physics. Viewed in this way, interpretation now is the direct perception of family resemblances between problem-situations, one already solved and the other in need of solution, without the aid of intermediate correspondence rules. If the function of correspondence rules is to correlate scientific expressions with nature, then this function is now served by these exemplar problem-solutions which one finds at the end of chapters in physics and chemistry books. One does not master his science until he "gets the knack" of how to use and apply these prototype problem-solutions,10 which are notably expressed in the '"Which is what T.S. Kuhn means by "paradigms" in the strict sense.</page><page sequence="9">170 Theodore Kisiel language of models and metaphors, of waves, particles, hydraulic models for the flow of electric current, and the like. This dimension of scientific language, which was forced to the periphery by positivism and downgraded to a "mere" heuristic function, now comes to the fore in the new image of science and emerges front and center as the operative language in interpretation and discovery. In the words of Heidegger, one might accordingly say that the new image of science assumes "a transformed relation to the essence of language." For the operative language is now viewed as a cultural storehouse of metaphors latent with untold possibilities for adaptation to the shifting demands of the changing problematic of science. The leading edge of scientific change is now situated in the interaction of the old language with a new situation which evokes surprising aspects from the old language not previously seen in it. The metaphoric shift ensuing from the translation of the scientific language from one problem-situation to another may at times shift the very bases of a scientific discipline, by making a hitherto peripheral metaphor into a root metaphor and thus reweaving the fabric of fundamental concepts of the scientific domain, producing as it were a re-edition of the Book of Nature. This ability of language to adapt to the changing demands of the scientific problematic constitutes a more diachronic sense of scientific rationality as compared to the synchronic concern for the form and validity of finished logical systems. This new notion of scientific rationality sees change and rationality as not only not incompatible but in fact essential to one another. In the face of a historically changing world, the most rational thing to do is to change with it. Instead of the hermeneutic model, which focuses on the dynamics of the. linguistic change which takes place in interpretation, an evolutionary model of "variation and selective perpetuation" of concepts and hypotheses is more commonly used among philosophers of science to comprehend the rationality of scientific change. Thus, Toulmin speaks of the "ecological demands" of an "intellectual environment" imposing a "selective pressure" on the available pool of conceptual variants in order to filter out the most adaptable for perpetuation." In a similar vein, the hermeneutic model underscores "Stephen Toulmin, Human Understanding, Volume I: The Collective Use and Evolution of Concepts, (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1972) pp. 134-144, 211-212.</page><page sequence="10">Heidegger and the New Images of Science 171 the importance of sensitivity to contextual determinants as guides to the appropriate interpretation of texts. The same applies to discovery. As we search for the appropriate word for a particular context, we are acutely aware that the context "demands" the recalcitrant word and no other, "rejects" the ones we do pose to it and instead "suggests" other directions of interrogation. The situation "asks" to be straightened out in certain ways while it screens out others, and we must be responsive to these interrogative solicitations and salient vectors if we are to come to an appropriate solution. Such attempts to describe the selection process seem to attribute a much more active role to the context than a more positivistic mentality, wary of anthropomorphism, would allow. But it is in fact an attempt to establish a new and more holistic sense of "objectivity" - Sachlichkeit und nicht Objektivitat — oriented to the Gestalt complex of the problematic situation. Both the hermeneutic and the evolutionary model converge remarkably on such a demand response "logic" of selection imposed by the situation itself, and in fact take us to the threshold of a reversal after the fashion of the later Heidegger, where what is said and what is talked about now not only talks back to us but even decides for us! Thus, in his meditation on the nature of thinking in Was heisst Denkeril, Heidegger culminates in a form of this question which he formulates variously as "What calls us to thought?", "What invites (appeals to, demands, instructs, directs) us to think?" and hence "What gives directions to thought?"12 Whence the hermeneutic maxim to which Ricoeur sometimes alludes: The context decides, and we are led to decide accordingly, as we use all available contextual determinants in order to expose the most appropriate sense of a message charged with a fluid potential of meanings. Consider, by way of example, the sentences "Man is a wolf," "Juliet is the sun," "The world is my oyster," in which the action of the context excludes the literal sense by way of its absurdity and then directs us to more metaphorical senses. It is in terms of this interplay between restrictions and latitudes that one ultimately acknowledges that meaning is interpreted by its context, i.e., in terms of what the context permits. But the context not only determines which interpretations are appropriate and thus provide an adequate solution to our problems but nWhat is Called Thinking?, pp. 114-117.</page><page sequence="11">172 Theodore Kisiel also, and perhaps more importantly, which problems are appropriate, in terms of both the importance of the problem and the readiness of the field to handle it. The researcher must take his cues from his historical situation .in exercising "good judgment" with regard to the most promising problems as well as their adequate solutions. Prior to the right solution comes the much more subtle - and risky - decision of asking the right question, and in the right way, under pain of squandering years in a fruitless search for the resolution of a problem which simply will not yield. A scientific problem quite often must await its opportune time before scientific developments provide it with the resources that make it veritably "ripe" for solution. After a long incubation period, there comes a time when the potential of the field is such that the discovery of an outstanding solution cannot be postponed for long. Sometimes, precipitous events may suddenly turn a "fruitless" search into a time to "cultivate" new theoretical possibilities in order to "reap" the benefits of a recent intellectual "harvest" of "seminal" ideas from a neighboring "field."13 When the opportune time for a problem comes, then the direction of its solution practically forces itself hs "the obvious guess"14 on the researcher steeped in his field, perhaps even leading to its simultaneous discovery by independent workers in the field. Consider, for example, the discovery of the double helical structure of DNA, prompted most proximately by the discovery of the oihelical structure of a protein molecule and supported by the opportune confluence of efforts in the disciplines of bacterial genetics, crystallographic physics and organic chemistry. The genesis and rapid blossoming of molecular biology can be specifically located at the intersection of these three domains, whose fusion was brought about by Watson and Crick's discovery, which in turn provided the key insight into the plethora of problems surrounding the genetic code or, in more popular jargon, "the secret of life." Molecular biology is just one example of a minor and peripheral specialty which suddenly and dramatically takes over the vanguard in the history of science and unfolds a new subject matter in a creative surge which makes it grow by "The agricultural metaphors which scientists themselves use in describing their situation are reminiscent of Heidegger's treatment of poetic "Building Dwelling Thinking." l4James D.

Other examples are x-ray crystallography and spectroscopy which played just such key roles at the turn of the century in the development of quantum physics. Such historical experiences suggest that it would be disastrous to distribute funds equitably to all fields; the task of the allocators is to play midwife to these spontaneous surges in burgeoning new fields of discovery, which are opening up at the expense of older fields in the process of being exhausted. The unevenness of the internal history of science, with its surprising turns of events and unexpected surges in forward progress through conceptual explosions which intersperse long incubation periods of gradual development, suggests the Heideggerian model for historicity in terms of the intermittent rhythms of unconcealment and concealment, truth and error. With all the continuing emphasis on the winners of the Nobel sweepstakes, there is now also a growing recognition of the important, even essential, role of the genial error in the history of science. There comes a time when a promising idea must be followed through to an ill-fated dead-end and thus shown to be a blind alley, a Holzwege. Such failures may well merit the name of science just as much as those endeavors for which the Nobel prizes are awarded. Shapere suggests, for example, that Justus Liebig's search, in the early days of organic chemistry, for a mathematizable "vital force" operative in organisms, analogous to the attractive forces of matter, was just such an enterprise.15 Of course, even the successes in science pick their way through a gauntlet of wrong turns and dead-ends. For instance, the initial steps toward the DNA discovery were marked by wrong decisions on both of the initial questions concerning the helical model, namely, the number of strands and the nature of the chemical bonding between the strands. Popper in particular has emphasized the trial-and-error character of scientific procedure and the significant role played by falsifiability in the logic of science. And Polanyi points to another kind of unavoidable error interwoven into the history of science, citing his own scientific work on physical .adsorption as an example of a discovery not immediately accepted by the scientific community because it was an idea too much out of season with the "Dudley Shapere, "Plausibility and Justification in the Development of Science," The Journal of Philosophy LX1II (1966), pp. 611-21.</page><page sequence="13">174 Theodore Kisiel reigning paradigm of physical chemistry at the time of its initial publication.16 The erratic course of the history of science is directly tied to the unspecifiability inherent in the process of scientific discovery. As noted above, the desire to eradicate this erratic dimension from science has found its extreme expression in the truncated image which equates science with the methodically controllable and verifiable and consequently excludes any consideration of the dimension of discovery. But if one refuses to exclude discovery from the essence of science and at the same time considers discovery at its fundament to outstrip all method and logic, then, for such a one, science would not be science without its profound roots in the unspecifiable, and therefore cannot be explained in terms of wholly explicit, wholly formalizable knowledge. What is to be called science would then include, for example, the unspecifiable art of "good judgment" by the scientific administrator groping in the dark in making his educated guesses on the most promising lines of research impending in his field. Among the new philosophers of science, Michael Polanyi in particular has pursued this direction of thinking to the point of outlining the ultimately ontological character of this dimension of the unspecifiable as it makes its presence felt in every phase of the scientific endeavor. Under the rubric of "personal knowledge", he stresses the central role of a kind of intimacy between the scientist and nature, an indwelling in its harmonies by means of theoretical patterns through which the discoverer senses the presence of the hidden truth which has yet to be revealed. The scientist acquires this intimacy by entering into the inherited interpretive framework of science and passionately committing himself to learning its ways. As they say in the vernacular, it is a matter of "getting a feel for" nature in the way science currently comes in contact with it. This tacit knowledge can only be conveyed by practice and from practicing scientists, through whom the novice assimilates the subliminal premises of his science. These premises weave the framework within which all of his scientific assertions are made, and yet, for this very reason, they themselves cannot be asserted. But despite its inarticulate state, this network is known intimately as his own interpretative framework, in which he dwells "as in the garment of [his] "Michael Polanyi, Knowing and Being, edited by Maijorie Grene (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1969) pp. 87-96.</page><page sequence="14">Heidegger and the New Images of Science 175 remarks in Being and Time (sectioh 69b) on the roots of theoretical behavior in praxis, which fundamentally constitute Heidegger's existential conception of science, i.e. science as an authentic mode of Being-in-the-world. Moreover, Polanyi's account also serves to counteract Heidegger's harsh and bleak metaphysical conception of modern science as "the absolute priority of method over its possible objects."20 But Heidegger himself promotes a similar move in his lecture of 1954 entitled "Science and Deliberation", which I believe can be read with great profit in the light of Polanyi's exposition of the tacit dimension of science.21 For the aim of this lecture is to promote a deliberation on a certain "inconspic uous state of affairs" latent in the heart of the matter of science. This incipient state of affairs which pervades the essence of the sciences is however by and large ignored and passed over in silence by them, since their natural orientation is more toward certified results and further progress in knowledge. Yet no matter how far removed the sciences seem to be from this incipient core, it is indispensable to them. They inevitably reside in it as a stream in its hidden source. Accordingly, the most profound way of thinking of science would seek to attune itself to this subliminal mooring in the facticity in which the sciences find their home. But such a "grass-roots" thinking in proximity to the source would involve a violent reversal of the normal movement of scientific progress. Indeed, it would constitute a regress from the sciences to their presuppositional underpinning. Because of their orientation away from their source, and the momentum of their progressive movement, the sciences of their own power cannot make this leap back to the source from which they have-sprung?2 This is the task of foundational thinking. Even more worthy of attention in the present situation is that the very spirit of modernity, seduced by the spell of certitude, guaranteed truth and assured progress, which encourages us to view science as a panacea, radically militates against such a reversal. More and more, scientific progress assumes the character of a forward project without a grounding facticity. Kant23 thus captured the essence of modern science wIn the letter published in Sallis (ed.), Heidegger and the Path of Thinking, p. 10. 2,Martin Heidegger, "Wissenschaft und Besinnung," Vortrage und Aufsatze (Pfullingen 1954) pp. 45-70.

Even the resulting theory is more than explicit knowledge; it is a foreknowledge of things yet unknown, unforeseeable, and perhaps even inconceivable at present, and it is in anticipation of these implications that the scientist passionately commits himself to this theory. For he believes himself to have come in contact with a reality whose inexhaustible depth, independence and power will permit it to manifest itself through his theory in ways even beyond his ken. He believes his theory is true, even without confirmations, but also and primarily because of the indeterminate range of future discoveries that he expects will issue from it. Thus Polanyi sees the entire process of discovery, from initial investiture through the explanatory phase to the final commitment to its outcome, under the sway of what he calls the "ineffable domain,"18 which could readily be one of Heidegger's more topological names for Being. Polanyi himself explicitly acknowledges the kinship between the pretheoretical know-how that he calls "personal knowledge" and Heidegger's conception of Seinsverstandnis.19 Moreover, he after a fashion performs a Heideggerian kind of reversal when he espies, in and through the tacit skills, a tacit dimension of reality operative as the alpha and omega of science. in Polanyi's account, the locus of science is clearly displaced from the image of science as method to that of science as a craft skill, an intellectual "savvy" and tacit judgment which cannot be supplanted by method, precedes and grounds it, and provides it with its viability. Put most starkly, science viewed from this side of its coin is no longer a science at all but rather an art, a techne in the best Greek sense of an artistic know-how capable of evoking (bringing forth, producing) truth in and through an artwork. The scientist is made a kin to the artisan craftsman steeped in his art, responsive to his material as he attunes himself to it through his tools, and sensitive to how they relate to human existence. This emphasis provides a profound concretization to the few "Michael Polanyi, Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy (New York: Harper Torchbook, 1964) pp. 60, 64. "Ibid., p. 87.

Rather than subjecting ourselves to "nature's leading-strings," we must force nature to answer questions of our own choosing. In this vein, Einstein spoke of the "free inventions" of hypothesizing and Galileo readily admitted that fictional idealizations such as "freely falling body" and "frictionless plane" constituted a veritable "rape of the senses." Yet both saw the adventures of hypothesizing counterbalanced by the security and control of method. Among the new philosophers of science, Feyerabend has reacted so violently against the image of science as method and of its truth as a security blanket that he highlights the heady willfulness of science to the point of arbitrariness. He thus proposes an anarchistic image of science based on the single methodological principle of "anything goes" (short of murder). In practice, this entails "scientific" opposition to everything which is now accepted by the scientific establishment. In short, currently accepted facts must constantly be opposed by counterinductions from experience and accepted theories countered by the proliferation of alternative theories inconsistent with the accepted point of view, whereby one not only learns by his mistakes (as Popper maintains) but also deliberately proves all rules by seeking their exceptions. Inasmuch as Feyerabend concedes the need for a certain measure of tenacity to already established theories, his recipe stops just short of the nihilistic extreme of turning scientific change into a Dionysian frenzy of activism. Though at times it may approach slapstick pandemonium, when the active interplay between tenacity and proliferation becomes pitched to its most tumultuous, so that the thick of the action appears "unreasonable, nonsensical, mad, immoral... when seen from the point of view of a contemporary."24 Feyerabend's irreverent recipe of calculated willfulness and recalcitrance aims to turn science into the carefree abandon of a frolic. Against the image of the scientist as l'homme sérieux hard at work in the solemn and even sacred task of "the search for truth," Feyerabend would locate the sources of scientific discovery "Paul Feyerabend, "Against Method: Outline of an Anarchist Theory of Knowledge," Analyses of Theories and Methods of Physics and Psychology, edited by Michael Radner and Stephen Winokur, Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science, Volume IV , (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1970) p. 103, note 33.</page><page sequence="17">178 Theodore Kisiel as much in sppntaneous play as in reasoned planning. Whence his "plea for hedonism" which would change science "from a stern and demanding mistress into an attractive and yielding courtesan who tries to anticipate every wish of her lover."25 But Heidegger espies a similar frenetic character to science precisely within the secure confines of its method. Willful projects continue to proliferate through the fissioning of scientific disciplines into specializations, each of whom are in turn prolific in the production of results. Each specialty imposes severe limits upon itself and the kinds of questions it wishes to pose, thereby cutting itself off all the more from an awareness of its enabling ground. The advantage of this strategy of minimizing thinking is to maximize results, so that the overall effect of the multiplication of specialties is the accumulation of a vast store of detailed, technically useful information. Here we encounter the narrower technocratic image of science as research and discovery which is wholly compatible with what Nietzsche termed the triumph of scientific method over science. "Research" in this sense is now Big Business. The proliferation in recent decades of the "think tanks" of research institutions for various and sundry purposes suggests to what extent the "knowledge industry" has replaced manual and machine labor as the most important productive force today. That the businesslike pursuit of knowledge is virtually open-ended while at the same time remaining systematic indicates how the security of method and the adventure of research can be interlocked in their progressive drift toward rootlessness. To paraphrase Victor Hugo, technical science has long sought a perpetual motion machine. It has finally found it... in itself. This total mobilization of human talent as well as natural resources finds its most intense expression in the uninhibited will to power toward planetary domination through technology. By means of the power of technology, nature has been provoked into revealing hitherto unsuspected sources of electrical and nuclear energy. Recently, even outer space has been placed at our disposal as another resource to be exploited. So sure were our planners of the power of technology that the question was never whether we would land on the moon, only how soon "Paul Feyerabend, "Consolations for the Specialist," Criticism and the Growth of Knowlege, edited by Imie Lakatos and Alan Musgrave (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard UP, 1970) p. 229.</page><page sequence="18">Heidegger and the New Images of Science 179 and by what means. The new cybernetic sciences appear to know no bounds in the possibilities of planetary planning and the capacity to work our will upon the entire earth. It appears that man is now in a position to assume the role of unequivocal lord and master exercising dominion over the earth. But is the technological will really a freedom without limits? The ecology and the energy crisis dramatically testify to the contrary. And there is science-fiction's recurring nightmare of the giant computer turning the tables and overpowering its masters. In numerous ways, the technological matrix is impelled by a will to total efficiency which factors in man himself to the point of total absorption, who is after all also a natural resource to be exploited for its energy and distributed to its most effective stations in the "manpower" grid. Technology thereby takes revenge on man himself. But in the Heideggerian perspective, all of these are but symptoms of a more radical limit to our freedom, a fundamental non-willing latent in the very will to will of the technological project. To acknowledge this most extreme limit is to take the first resolute step toward displacing this seemingly free-floating project back to its most facticitous roots. For we can always ask: What demands that we demand to the point of excess in the technological mode of existence? What provokes us to provoke nature resourcefully to the point of including our own resourceful selves? Perhaps we will then see that the thoughtless willfulness of exploitation is basically not of our own will. Our changing of the face of the earth is ultimately not of our own doing. We have long ago been led to the historical destiny of technology and can no longer turn back. No International Planning Commission or Committee of Scientists have done so, nor can they really hope to do so. But we can turn our thoughtless willfulness around by first acknowledging the oblivion of its rootedness, as well as the oblivion of this oblivion, so that we might then come to terms with the flow of our current historical situation, what is taking place in it, the leeway it grants us and what we can start with it. This orientation of questioning thus aims to bring us "to experience the call of a more original revelation" within and through the truth of technology, to espy the harbingers of a new setting in and through the scientific-technological world, to find new roots for life in such a world, to find ways of making ourselves at home in this world, so that, in one of Heidegger's favorite expressions, we may once again learn "to dwell poetically upon this</page><page sequence="19">180 Theodore Kisiel earth." Accordingly, Heidegger clearly hopes that the backtrack into and through the metaphysical conception of science and technology will be propaedeutic to a more poetic conception. One of its central tasks would be to elaborate a new sense of the naturality of nature in and through the artifacts of science and technology, uto recast and recover the calculability and technicality of nature in the open mystery of a newly experienced naturality of nature".26 And perhaps the time is not so far off for such a development. The ecology crisis and energy crisis suggest certain limits to our sense of nature as universally manipulable, whether as a scientifically calculable system of forces or as a technological fund of resources, and accordingly evoke the need to let it be, to cultivate, conserve, foster and cherish the Dasein of our planet in a more responsive manner. One might also hope for a measure of a poetic sense of science and technology from the more explicitly artistic endeavors to use their materials — Heidegger might call these the "earth" of science and technology - in the mobiles of constructivism, technological sculpture, film, perhaps even cybernetic music. Perhaps some day we may well learn to view, for example, synthesized plastics as no less natural than things found more directly in nature. Then there is the poetic-mystical strain in the Marxist tradition which sees the progressive naturalization of man through technology in mutual coordination with a progressive humanization of nature. Among others in this tradition, Marcuse, an old student of Heidegger, looks toward the emergence of a New Science and New Technology in which nature and man would no longer be related in the mutual exploitation of master and slave but rather in the mutual liberation of communicating partners, precisely to the degree that technology pacified the forces of nature by liberating them from the brutality, ferocity and blindness which has made nature our antagonist from time immemorial.27 Astounding as it may sound to our positivistically conditioned ears, wary of all anthropomorphisms, this kind of suggestion is being seriously entertained by thinkers of the most diverse philosophical perspectives. For example, Mary B. Hesse's quest for a new form of objectivity for science prompts her to consider a more internal relationship between man and at least biological nature than an ^Martin Heidegger, Hebel der Hausfreund Pfullingen: Neske, 1957) p. 24.

So there is no lack of signs of a vigorous quest for a new habitat for man in a new, more ecological sense of the naturality of nature, a more historical and topological form of objectivity (Sachlichkeit), a less mathematical and more hermeneutical notion of rationality.29 Even though science has been rendered thoughtless by the positivistic image of science, there appears to be no dearth of thinkers, scientists included, seeking to provide us with more imaginative images of a science more responsive to the most profound exigencies of the human situation. I have tried to suggest that Heidegger has blazed a trail which helps to to see how this proliferation of new images converges on the simple heart of the matter in which we live, move and are.
