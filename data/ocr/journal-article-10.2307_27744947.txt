<plain_text><page sequence="1">History of Philosophy Quarterly Volume 20, Number 2, April 2003 SOCRATIC WISDOM Emmanuel Kofi Ackah 1 INTRODUCTION Socratic moral philosophy, as Plato represents it to us in his early period dialogues,1 can be read as a search for episte mic conditions necessary and sufficient for happiness.2 The search is based on a hopeful belief that a certain sort of moral knowledge will make its possessor always get things done rightly: he will be infallible, inerrant and luck-independent.3 It follows from this that akrasia is impossible, namely, that it is impos sible to have that sort of knowledge and be bad.4 Following Aristotle, Socrates' anti-akrasia thesis has generally been thought implausible and naive about human psychology: Socrates ignores the difference between knowing and doing, as well as our non-rational side.5 For it is not uncommon to hear: "I knew it was wrong to do, but couldn't help it," where "couldn't help it" refers, not to an overwhelming external force, but to some psy chological or moral imperative. I believe, however, that Aristotle and his followers assume a conception of knowledge inconsistent with Socrates'. Recent scholarship understands Socrates' "What is X?" question as questing for essential definitions,6 namely, as questing for the defining characteristics of X?that which make X what it is to be X. But essential definitions, however understood, constitute a species of knowledge that in contrast to a knowledge how, and it is at least implausible that to know that "Justice is . . ." en tails acting justly.7 Thus Hugh Benson's Socratic Wisdom (2000, Oxford), based on a definitional account of the Socratic quest for moral knowledge, yields the following conclusion: [Socratic knowledge/wisdom/expertise] is a power or capac ity (dunamis) to make judgments resulting in an interrelated 123</page><page sequence="2">124 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY coherent system of true cognitive states involving a particular object or subject matter. The latter cognitive states, when co herently interrelated and resulting from judgments occasioned by such knowledge, are knowledge states (p. 220; cf. 190, 211). We may fairly impute to Socrates the belief that, generally, knowl edge/wisdom/expertise entails successful action, and specifically, that moral knowledge entails living well or a happy life. But Soc rates was primarily concerned with the latter, specific knowledge; and this is demonstrated, not only explicitly in his discussion of the connection between knowledge/wisdom/virtue and happiness in the Euthydemus and Gorgias, but also, implicitly, in his search in other early dialogues for the knowledge which he claims is equal to virtue. We may then ask: what is the relationship between Benson's Socratic knowledge and happiness? If I understand Benson, then despite the envious erudition by which he obtained his result, it seems to me that his account of Socratic wisdom is compatible with the most vicious and successful criminality. I doubt that a coherent system of beliefs generated from a founda tional definitional knowledge that "Piety is . . ." would really be incompatible with criminal intention.8 Benson begs the question, when he urges us to leave open the question of what definitional knowledge amounts to for Socrates (p. 155). Alternatively, a significant pointer to a Socratic model of moral knowledge, observed by Socratic scholars, is the Socratic claim that moral knowledge is like craft knowledge.9 However, the point of identity in this analogy must be carefully delineated. True, knowing and doing are inextricably linked in crafting, and craft ing meets Socrates' quest for explanation/justification by involving an accountable process of production. But a craftsman may choose never to exercise his knowledge, whereas Socrates' anti-akrasia thesis equates moral knowledge and living well. Consequently, craft-knowledge may illuminate Socrates' conception of moral knowledge, but it is still inadequate to express the Socratic con ception of moral knowledge as entailing living well. So I shall argue for a model of Socratic knowledge that does justice to the equation of knowledge and living well. Incidental to developing this model of knowledge, I shall argue that Socrates searches for moral first principles rather than definitions, as is traditionally believed. As a corollary, I shall argue that the acquisition of moral first principles fuses knowledge that and how, in that the very process by which such principles may come to be self-consciously acquired, i.e., known, would culminate in self-conscious commit ment to them, yielding not only a desire to live by them, but also</page><page sequence="3">SOCRATIC WISDOM 125 a conscious ability to consistently exhibit, identify or account for the same principles in all relevant circumstances. My approach to the issue of Socratic moral knowledge shall be by way of identifying the basic conditions of that knowledge. I shall, however, begin by showing what Socratic knowledge is not. 2 What Socratic Wisdom Is Not As already indicated, scholars who find Socrates' anti-akrasia thesis implausible appear to assume that by the knowledge which he equates to virtue Socrates means a species of knowing that as distinct from knowing how. To know how is to be able to do something. To justify a claim to know how it is usually neces sary to be able to exhibit the skill under the proper circum stances. On the other hand, to know that typically raises questions of truth and error, evidence, argument, justification or confirmation. Thus to correctly claim to know that is to be lieve a proposition that is true and for which one has evidence. Knowing that and knowing how may be exemplified indepen dently of each other. Someone can accurately describe how to do something without being able to do it. And people who perform some skills quite ably may be unable to provide accurate de scription of what they are good at doing. There are, however, some cases where knowing how and knowing that are insepa rable: e.g., in the playing of chess. Generally, however, knowing how is more of an ability to do than knowing that. Because Socrates' "What is X?" question is understood as a quest for definitional knowledge, the answer to which is stat able in propositional terms, the following conditions are assumed to underlie Socratic moral knowledge. Letting "A" be the person who knows and "p" a proposition about one of Socrates' cardinal virtues, then A knows p if and only if: (1) A believes p (2) p is true (3) A has adequate evidence/reasons for p As constituting basic conditions for knowing that, (1) to (3) are at least necessary for the following reasons:10 (1) It is a contra diction to say that A knows that p but A does not believe p. "I know that you are bad," entails "I believe that you are bad." Hence, believing is one condition of knowing that. But as Plato argued in his Theaetetus (187a ff.) merely believing is not suffi cient for knowing, otherwise there will be no falsehood. Other</page><page sequence="4">126 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY conditions are required. Hence, condition (2), namely, that one who knows that must hold a true belief. For it is a contradiction to know what is false. "A knows that the earth is flat" is, by cur rent astronomical knowledge, false. Yet having true belief, though necessary, is still not sufficient for knowing that, unless A can offer sufficient reason or evidence in support of the belief (cf. Meno 97b-98a). For A knows that p but A does not have adequate evi dence or good reasons for p is unacceptable, to say the least. Conditions (1) to (3) may be textually justified from a num ber of early dialogue passages, two of which will suffice to illustrate my point. Take Socrates' claim at Meno (97b-98a), that for practical purposes, right opinion is not less useful than knowl edge, except that knowledge is right opinion stabilized in reason or account, and this condition of stability, it is implied, makes knowledge preferable to right opinion. This suggests that Socrates takes knowledge to be (1)* belief, that is (2)* true, and is (3)* grounded in reason or account. (1)*, (2)* and (3)* match (1), (2) and (3) above. In the Meno passage under discussion, however, Socrates was talking about knowledge in general and its relationship to practical success; he was not talking about the relationship between moral knowledge and living well,11 al though the Meno as a whole is concerned about how virtue, as a species of knowledge, is acquired. The Gorgias seems to have the best prospect of justifying con ditions (1) to (3) above as the model of Socratic knowledge/ wisdom. Specifically, I have in mind Gorgias 509a ff., where Socrates tells Callicles that certain elenctically enduring prin ciples, p, including the principle that it is more shameful and worse for one to do than to suffer injustice, are held fast and clamped by arguments of steel and adamant, at least apparently so, unless Callicles or someone else more intellectually virile can undo them ... ; that though I [Socra tes] do not know how these principles are (hoti ego tauta ouk oida hop?s echei), nevertheless, anyone I have ever met has not been unable to contradict them without appearing ridiculous. Clearly, Socrates believes in p. He also believes that p is true? if indeed p is bound by steely and adamantine arguments. However, Socrates does not know how p is, I assume, veridically so. What explains this level of ignorance? It appears that Socra tes is not at all doubtful about the moral truth of p.12 He is rather being open to the possibility that elenctic certification of p is logically and epistemically open. This is an issue about adequacy</page><page sequence="5">SOCRATIC WISDOM 127 of reason or evidence in support of p, not about the veridical value of p per se. For if one has adequate reasons/evidence for p, one will know how p is true. Thus if Socrates' claim that he does not know how p is true is consistent with his disavowals of moral knowledge,13 then we have a clue as to what, for Socrates, con stitutes moral knowledge/wisdom. To know is (1)** to believe some p, (2)** p must be true, and (3)** the one who knows must have adequate reasons/evidence in support of p. (1)**, (2)**, and (3)** correspond to (1), (2) and (3) above. Thus the Gorgias pas sage appears to confirm the model of knowledge that I claim are assumptively but, in my view wrongly, imputed to Socrates. A closer look, however, shows that, whereas the p of the model of knowledge under question is some empirical or assertorical state ment, the p of the Gorgias passage is categorically different, namely, a moral principle. The difference is fundamental: a moral principle is typically imperatival, and prescriptive of conduct; an empirical or assertorical statement typically is not. Hence, the Gorgias passage in question, and the Gorgias as a whole, will not, without qualification, justify an imputation to Socra tes of a species of knowledge that, namely, conditions (l)-(3), as what constitutes Socratic knowledge. Still, it may be argued that generally, conditions (1) to (3) may be textually justified from both a dialectical point of view and a definitional reading of Socrates' quest for an answer to his "What is X?" questions, where "X" ranges over Socrates' car dinal virtues. Assume p to be a definition of some virtue term or what the term denotes. Then, according to definitionists, Socrates by condition (1) expects his interlocutors to state a sin cere belief which is a definition of a virtue term or what the term denotes. By condition (2) Socrates supposes that p must have some alethic property, logical and/or evidential;14 and by condition (3) Socrates subjects p to elenctic test to verify the ad equacy or otherwise of the interlocutor's reason or evidence for it. This understanding of Socratic knowledge is highly problem atic. Benson's Socratic wisdom is one result of it; and, indeed, some definitionists are actually skeptical that a definitional knowledge of a virtue term or what the term denotes by itself can entail moral wisdom. Thus Brickhouse and Smith (1994, p. 61-64) note that definitional knowledge of a subject matter is only a part, though for them a necessary part, of what constitutes an expert's knowledge of his field. Talking about wisdom generally, they are perceptive in their observation, that</page><page sequence="6">128 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY [wjisdom . . . consists in the kind of knowledge by the possession of which one is able to perform the right acts and to judge the proper instances pertinent to the field of endeavor in which one is wise. [1] One aspect of such knowledge is not propositional: it requires the ability to do the right things at the right times . . . [2] Another aspect. . . has to do with the control knowledge gives its possessor over his or her inclinations. . . . But to these, we must add still another condition: [3] the wise person can always provide an account of his or her judgments (p. 38). However, by insisting on their belief that Socrates searches for definitions (p. 61), Brickhouse and Smith are unable to provide an account of Socratic wisdom that satisfies, in particular, their conditions [1] and [2]. I proceed now to provide a model of Socratic moral knowledge suggested by the texts that accommodates Brickhouse and Smith's three conditions, as well as makes Soc rates' anti-akrasia thesis plausible, or even most likely true. 3 Basic Conditions of Socratic Moral Knowledge Let us begin by assuming that one feature of what Socrates seeks to elicit by his "What is X?" question is the statement of a moti vating moral belief, i.e., a belief strong enough to motivate conduct. This is suggested in the Laches, where Socrates at tributes power (dunamis)15 to that denoted by the term "courage": So now try and tell (eipein)16 me on your part, Laches, about courage in the same way: what power is it (tis ousa dynamis) in pleasure or in pain or in all the things in which (en apasin ois) we just said now it was to be found, that has been singled out by the name, courage (Laches 192b6-9). On this note, let "A" stand for one who Socratically knows mor ally, and p for a motivating moral belief. Then, A knows p if and only if: (1) A consciously believes p (2) p is always fine and good (3) A has adequate reasons or evidence for p17 3.1 That A consciously believes p Socrates' "What is X?" question is normally addressed to per sons who claim to know morally or are reputed to be morally wise.18 There are two sub-conditions in this first condition of Socratic knowledge: 1(a) the condition of belief in p, and 1(b) consciousness of that belief. These are distinct yet textually so closely related that (lb) will be illustrated at once with (la).</page><page sequence="7">SOCRATIC WISDOM 129 Socrates expects a wise person to be consciously committed to some p, for a belief that is buried several layers over by others inconsistent with it will be dormant; nor will the possessor of such belief be aware of what the overlaid belief implies or en tails, let alone be able to account for it. The consciousness of belief condition is intimated, for example, in the Char mides, where Socrates tells Charmides: If temperance is present to you (soi paresti), you must have an opinion of her; she must give you some intimation of her be ing, which may enable you to form a notion of her?what it is and what sort ofthing temperance is. (158e7-159a3) The phrase, if temperance is present to you, obviously reifies "temperance" as a principle of conduct. The language of being "present to" is, in my view, a periphrasis for being "conscious of." For Socrates believes that we are all deep down committed to virtue-consistent beliefs. He therefore expects Charmides, reputed for being temperate, to be conscious of the very prin ciple which distinguishes his reputed character, and to be able to state it. And in the Gorgias 497dl2-e2, Callicles nods to Socrates' question: Do you not call good people good by the presence of goodness in them, as you call beautiful those in whom beauty is present (ho?sper tous kalous ois as hallos parei)?19 Again in the Gorgias, Socrates vows to make "Callicles agree with Callicles," to make him "see himself aright" (482bc, 495e). What follows, indicates that Socrates seeks to show that Callicles, like everybody else, subconsciously affirms justice and temperance to be better principles than injustice and intemper ance, which he presently affirms more consciously. By elenctic process (of which more anon), Socrates seeks to induce in Callicles a conscious commitment to temperance and justice by showing that their opposites entail consequences that Callicles himself, like every fully informed person, consider to be unde sirable. If to be temperate and just, etc., is to be Socratically wise, then the foregoing passages suggest that Socrates expects that one condition of being wise is to be self-consciously com mitted to beliefs that motivate virtuous conduct. However, what Socrates searches for, by elenctic examining, are not merely beliefs that motivate moral conduct; they are be liefs (a) that significantly affect people's lives20 because they (b) prescribe and determine the choices we make. Because Socrates</page><page sequence="8">130 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY searches for type (a) beliefs, he insists on his interlocutors saying only what they really believe;21 and because type (a) beliefs have operational character (b), Socrates compares such beliefs to the prescriptive and regulatory function of craft knowledge: the good person (o agathos an?r) ... is just like any other craftsman, who, having his own particular product in view, selects the things he applies to that product of his, not at ran dom, but with the purpose of giving a certain form to whatever he is working upon. (503d6-e5) The operational character of the beliefs sought in Socratic phi losophy is also compared to that of a principle of law, by which issues of fact are selected and evaluated by the judge, for the just determination of the matter on hand: Then, is it not by using a kind of justice (dikaiosyne) that they are punished those who are rightly punished? (478a9-10)22 And, in the Euthyphro, it is clearly implied that the special be lief sought by the Socratic "What is X?" question is one which, as a principle of conduct, operates with laser-like power in illu minating right and wrong judgments/choices. Hence, Socrates expects the reputed or self-acclaimed religious expert to teach [him, Socrates] what . . . [piety] itself is, so that [he, Socrates] may look to it and use it as a paradigm which, should those things which [Euthyphro] or someone else may do be of that sort, [he, Socrates] may affirm that they are pious but should they not be of that sort, deny it. (6e3-6, with my emphasis) Perhaps further evidence is needed. But so far, the foregoing considerations suggest that it is reasonable to claim that for Socrates certain beliefs motivate our moral conduct; that these in a way are determinative of our moral choices, thereby signifi cantly affecting our lives, for better or for worse. Thus the target of Socrates' moral search is some foundational or first principles. This would imply that the question, "What is X?" where X ranges over virtue terms, seeks to elicit the statement, not the defini tion, of the sort of belief we have described. A wise person is supposed to be self-consciously committed to some sort of moti vating beliefs, and to be able to state and justify them on demand. But this is not enough. For such beliefs to determine wise con duct, they must have some alethic property in respect of their practical consequences. This leads me to second condition of Socratic knowledge.</page><page sequence="9">SOCRATIC WISDOM 131 3.2 That p is always fine and good Socrates believes that beliefs that determine wise conduct have alethic property: they must entail the fine and the good.23 Part of the function of the elenchus is to bring this "fact" to the conscious ness of interlocutors. We have seen that what Socrates seeks by his elenctic examination are prescriptive and motivative beliefs. Like all moral principles, these beliefs carry the desires, inter ests, goals and expectations of their holders. In this lies their prescriptivity and motivativity. So the effect, if not the purpose, of subjecting such beliefs to elenctic examination, is to examine their practical implications and consequences outside the subjec tivity of the individual by means of publicly accessible canons of reasoning.24 If such beliefs can survive elenctic test, they would thus be principles that either everyone or every fully informed person has good reason to affirm, since they would entail the fine and the good for one. To give a few examples. In Charmides, in answer to the question, "What is temper ance?" Charmides says: "temperance is quietness." But Charmides also agrees with Socrates both that "temperance is always fine" (kalon), and that "quietness is not always fine" (159b-160d). In a second attempt, Charmides says: "temperance is modesty," and agrees with Socrates both that "temperance is good" (agathon) but "modesty is not always good" (160e-161b). Or take Laches' second refutation. To the question, "What is courage?" Laches answers: "courage is endurance of the soul." But he agrees with Socrates that "courage is fine," yet "endur ance is not always fine," certainly not foolish endurance (Laches 192b-d). In all these elenchi, the interlocutor'sp has been shown not to entail the fine and good. But since the refutation of the interlocutor's p depends upon showing that it does not entail what is fine and good, this implies that Socrates is searching for a p that entails the fine and good. The Gorgias shows that gen erally the content of the fine (kalon) and the good (agathon) is constituted by physical, social, psychological and spiritual ben efits; and that the specific content of these benefits includes self-sufficiency, absence of shameful consequences of one's ac tions, preservation of one' good health, dignity or honor, and assured friendship among humans and gods, etc.25 Thus Socrates leads Polus to accept that whatever is fine (kalon) is so on account of being either pleasant (hedu) or ben eficial (chresimon, ophelimon) or both (474d3-475a4); that the opposite of the fine is shameful (aischron), and the opposites of</page><page sequence="10">132 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY pleasant and beneficial are painful (luperon) and harmful (kakon) (475a4-5). Some indication of what constitutes "beneficial"/ "pleasant'7"fine" in contrast to "harmfur7"painful"/"shameful" is suggested by one of Socrates' refutations of the Calliclean principle that intemperate hedonism entails happiness (494ell 495al)?and this goes as follows. Desires (epithymiai) are the sort of things that can grow so wild as to cost a great deal of resources and distress in trying to satisfy them (493a-d4). Ac cordingly, whereas the temperate person, who is fully informed of what he really needs is content when he meets his basic needs, the intemperate will suffer continuous distress or pain from feel ing continual dissatisfaction (493d6-494a2). He will become a robber (l?istou bion zonta), who is interminably in trouble in trying to satisfy desires gone wild (507el-3). Nor can such a permanently needy person be socially desirable or be in com munion with god (507e4-7). This argument shows that intemperance entails social/psychological/spiritual/physical harm to the intemperate: he not only suffers bodily harm, and becomes always needy and socially parasitic, but also he loses the social/psychological/spiritual good of friendship with humans or gods. It is implied that temperance, the opposite of intemper ance, entails corresponding physical/social/psychological/ spiritual benefits. To be wise, then, is for Socrates, to be self consciously committed to principles whose operation entail social/ psychological/spiritual/physical benefits?principles that will not lead one to shameful conduct, that will preserve or promote one's good health, self-esteem, and friendship among humans and gods. 3.3 That A has adequate reasons or evidence for p Finally, a person is wise, i.e., knows morally, if he has adequate reasons/evidence for his conscious motivating beliefs. Only thus can he be expected to be able to explain or justify his claim or reputation for wisdom. I have argued that by his "What is X?" question, Socrates seeks, not the definition of a virtue term but the statement of a motivating belief, a sort of moral first prin ciple. Now statements of moral principles are not assertion statements. So how can they be examined for adequacy of rea son or evidence that supports them? The answer is that moral principles are partly empirical and partly attitudinal. On this view a moral principle can analytically be unpacked into two constituent elements: (a) a sequence of inductive facts (b) attitudinal belief that action consistent with (a) is good for one.26</page><page sequence="11">SOCRATIC WISDOM 133 As constituting a moral principle, the (b)-component of (a) + (b) carries (or the (a)-component induces) the desires, interests, goals, expectations, etc. of the person committed to it.27 Basi cally, (b) is an expression of commitment to (a), based on each inductive evidence in (a) being perceived by A as good for him/ her, and the cumulative effect of the inductive sequence as a whole inducing commitment to (a). To verify or justify a moral principle is to do so in terms of its (a)-component. To change one's moral attitude to a situation or one's commitment to a moral principle, depends on changing one's perception of the ^-com ponent. As already indicated, it is an implication of Socratic dialectics that a motivating belief that cannot, in fact and logic, survive elenctic examination is incapable of entailing, i.e., al ways bringing about, the fine and good. The commonly accepted formal representation of a typical elenctic search is as follows. Taking X as denoting a virtue, and p for an interlocutor's sincere belief stated as an answer to the ques tion, "What is X?" the interlocutor, under questioning, also sincerely accepts another belief about virtue, q; but q entails the negation of p.28 The interlocutor, however, more deeply believes q than p. Hence, he is dialectically refuted. More graphically: (1) Socrates: What is X? (2) Interlocutor: X is p (3) Socrates: But X is always fine/good29 (4) Interlocutor: Yes (5) Socrates: Yet p is not always fine/good30 (6) Interlocutor: Yes (7) Socrates: So X is not p (8) Interlocutor Yes. At (1) we have the usual Socratic "What is X?" question. At (2) the interlocutor states his motivating belief, p. For example, to the Socratic question, "What is piety and impiety?" Euthyphro points to his own action, and declares: [i] Piety is . . . prosecuting whoever has committed wrong and not prosecuting is impiety (5d8-e2). [ii] Consider what a proof I will give you?a proof which I have already given to others? of the [divine] law (ton nomou) that the impious ought not to go unpunished. Do not mankind regard Zeus as the best and the most righteous of the gods? They admit that he bound his father Cronos because he wickedly devoured his sons, and that Cronos too had castrated his own father Uranus for a similar reason. . . . And yet when I proceed against my father, they are angry with me. So inconsistent are they in their way of talking. (Euthyphro, 5e-6a)</page><page sequence="12">134 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY [i] Euthyphro perfectly understood Socrates as demanding a statement (not a definition) of a substantive principle. Euthyphro calls it the law, namely, that "whoever has done wrong ought to be punished." He insists that his action is based on this prin ciple; and he indicates that, in applying this principle, he desires by his action to avoid some social, psychological or spiritual harm, namely, to cleanse himself and his household of the con tagion of pollution which his father's conduct will produce (4c). [ii] Notice that in the sentence beginning with "Consider what a proof I will give you" Euthyphro simply unpacks the inductive evidence from which the principle has been distilled, namely, the (a)-component of the principle. Let us formally recast his decision-making argument thus: (a*) The gods dislike and punish x or y or z (b*) It is always harmful for one to do/condone x or y or z31 (assumed) (c) My father's conduct at time t and place j is an x (d) Therefore my father's conduct must be punished rather than condoned. Both (a*) and (b*) organically constitute Euthyphro's p, the (a*)-component representing the inductive sequence of facts for those like Euthyphro who believe them; (b*) is Euthyphro's at titudinal belief in (a*)?as he believes that action that positively shows a dislike for and punishes x will entail an ablution of the blood pollution that will result from his father's conduct. P was triggered into operation by a morally relevant situation (c), while (d) represents action in response to (a* + b*) and (c). Whether the benefit/harm envisaged in (b*) is real or merely perceived depends on whether (a*) entails it. The elenchus functions to verify this entailment. Euthyphro's initial p was rejected for being not necessary for the occurrence of pious conduct: it fails to be that which explains all occurrences of pious and impious conduct (6d6-7). But if so, Euthyphro's p cannot entail the ben efits or avoid the harms which must accompany a truly pious conduct. The basic problem with Euthyphro's p is its lack of empirical content and inductive verifiability: how can one verify, in fact and in logic, what gods like and dislike, or, indeed, that the gods dislike x, y or z? In this respect, Euthyphro's initial p shares with his subsequent p's the implicit attempt to derive morality from anthropomorphic theology. In the main argument of the Euthyphro, Socrates argues that, in fact and in logic, morality cannot be derived from anthropomorphic theology: Euthyphro has no means of knowing whether or not what he</page><page sequence="13">SOCRATIC WISDOM 135 does will please (all) the gods. Thus Euthyphro's p's were falsi fied: Euthyphro has failed to show that they entail anything fine and good.32 Callicles, in justifying his commitment to the principle that might is both right and entails resourcefulness and happiness, argues as follows: But I believe that nature itself makes it clear that it is right (or just, dikaion) for the better to have more than the worse, the stronger more than the weaker. [Nature] shows that this is the case in many areas, not only among other animals but also in entire cities and races of men, where the right has been judged to consist in the superior ruling the inferior and hav ing more than he. For what kind of right did Xerxes rely on when he campaigned against Greece? Or his father [Darius] against the Scythians? Countless examples of these sort could be mentioned. I believe these men do these things in accor dance with the nature of the right?yes by Zeus, in accordance with the law of nature, not, perhaps, by convention. (Gorgias, 483d8-e4) Clearly, Callicles' principle that might is right and entails hap piness is based on an attitudinal perception of an inductive sequence of facts, which are severally supposed to be a complete evidence for the principle, and jointly induce commitment to those 'facts. Hence follows Callicles' supervening moral belief: that it is right for the better or stronger to have more than or to rule the worse or weaker. On the basis of this belief, together with the belief that happiness consist in having the courage or power to maximize one's desires and gratify them, Polus and Callicles argue that having the power to do what pleases one makes one happy. Rhetorical skill is one such power; and hav ing absolute political power?to kill, banish, etc., your enemies with impunity, is a classic case. Hence, Polus believes, Archelaus, the tyrant of Maced?n, must be happy (473d). In refuting Callicles, Socrates argues that there is a differ ence between (i) what one wishes and (ii) doing what seems good to one (467c ff.). This distinction is intended to show that one may do what turns out to be harmful to one. In other words, the tyrant who (ii) kills or banishes his enemies, believing it to be the best thing to do, ultimately wishes for (i) happiness, like everyone else, but the mere wielding of absolute power does not entail happiness. It is therefore implied that only knowledge of a sort?temperance or justice?bridges the gap between (i) and (ii). For Socrates conceives temperance or justice as a power of</page><page sequence="14">136 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY knowing what one really needs for one's happiness. Callicles" principle is not informed by an inductive sequence of facts (cases of the use of power) which severally and jointly entail happiness. (3) The principle at step (3) in the elenctic procedure?that temperance is always fine and good?is one of a species of be liefs that Socrates uses to test the logical and evidential adequacy of interlocutors' beliefs, namely, as to whether, in fact and in logic, it entails the fine and the good. For want of a better term, let us call such beliefs "benchmark beliefs." The crucial role played by the benchmark belief at (3) is already intimated in the preceding paragraphs; but further understanding is required. To verify the adequacy of reason or evidence for the interlocutor's p, Socrates attacks the (a)-component of the interlocutors' p with a counter-example, as at (3) with (5). If the counter example is successful, p is falsified; consequently, p fails to entail, i.e., al ways guarantee, the fine and good. By insisting on the Interlocutor justifying p, Socrates insists on the Interlocutor proving that the (a)-component of p entails the fine and the good. If the Interlocutor cannot prove this, he fails to justify his claim or reputation for wisdom; for he fails to show that he is fully informed of the implications and consequences of the principles he is committed to, and that he is consciously committed to prin ciples which determine a person to be wise. In an elenchus about a virtue, Socrates will invoke at least one benchmark belief as a premise. Hitherto an elenctic encoun ter, a benchmark belief often lies deep in an interlocutor's subconscious, buried over by other more conscious beliefs that are often inconsistent with it. A benchmark belief is believed by Socrates and the interlocutor to be an enduring and self-evident truth.33 A benchmark belief is not to be confused with what Soc rates seeks when he asks his "What is X? question, which is a moral first principle, namely, what temperance itself is, what justice, itself is, etc. The primary role of a benchmark belief is to ensure that if any one claims to be wise, he must show that his moral lifestyle is determined by principles which pass the test of entailing the fine and good. The truth of a benchmark belief is not directly proven; nor does it depend on its being dozastic:34 it is rather based on its role as a benchmark belief, on its role in testing the logical/evi dential adequacy of Interlocutors' moral beliefs, and on the fact that in repeated elenctic processes, any interlocutor who main tains a thesis inconsistent with it turns out to be ridiculous. It is by reference to benchmark beliefs that Socrates declares in</page><page sequence="15">SOCRATIC WISDOM 137 the Gorgias that everyone believes that "doing wrong is in any case more shameful and more harmful than suffering wrong"?a principle, according to Socrates, held firm and fastened with reasons of steel and adamant; and though it is falsifiable in theory, and Socrates does not know how it is true, no one has denied that principle without appearing ridiculous (508e-509a). Similarly in the Crito. Socrates is so convinced of the benefi cial consequences of certain benchmark beliefs, that he confidently reminds Crito, in a situation of life and death, that: I cannot abandon the principles (tous logons) which I used to hold in the past simply because this situation has happened to me; they seem to me as much as they were, and I respect and regard the same principles now as before. So unless we can find better principles in this [misfortune], you can be quite sure that I shall not agree with you. (Crito, 46b6-c3; adapted from the trans, o? Hugh Tredennick, 1954) In the particular situation of the Crito, the benchmark beliefs in clude: "not mere life but good life is to be chiefly valued" (48b5-6); "not all opinions are useful but only those of the wise" (46c8-d2); "to live well is to live finely and justly" (48b8-9); "one ought never volitionally to do wrong" (49a4); and "one ought to fulfill one's just agreements" (49e6-8). To determine whether or not it is just to escape from prison, Socrates deployed these principles as premises in a moral argument involving a critical and inclusive assessment of consequential physical/social/psychological/spiritual harms and benefits to each party who would be affected by Socrates' decision one way or the other: Socrates himself, his friends, children, and Athenian society or state. By revealing that there will be far greater harm than benefits to each party if he escaped, Socrates concluded that it is better to remain in prison to die (Crito 54b).35 Thus what I have called "benchmark beliefs" play a crucial role in the Socratic quest for moral knowledge. As these beliefs are successfully em ployed dialectically to test the evidential and logical adequacy of the interlocutors' p's, in terms of whether p entails physical/social/ psychological/spiritual benefits in application, commitment to such beliefs must surely induce in the agent a moral sensibility, and a corresponding moral personality more rational and more benefi cial, than that induced by principles inconsistent with them.36 The following account of Socrates' encounter with Callicles, is to illustrate how the benchmark belief?that temperance en tails social-psychological/physical/spiritual benefits?enables Socrates to test the logical and evidential adequacy of Callicles'</page><page sequence="16">138 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY p. The main theme of the Gorgias is about how one ought to live (472c-d, 500c) or, alternatively, how to be happy. Ought one to live, can one be happy, by the principle of justice or temper ance?as Socrates believes?or by the principle of injustice or intemperance?as Polus and Callicles believe? Socrates vows to make "Callicles agree with Callicles" and to "see himself aright" (482bc, 495e). In other words, Socrates seeks to affect Callicles' moral beliefs (or part of it), by showing that, fully informed of their implications and consequences, Callicles, like everybody else, unconsciously affirms justice and temperance to be better principles than injustice and intemperance. Thus, by elenctic process, Socrates hopes to induce in Callicles, a conscious com mitment to principles which have more beneficial consequences for one's life than those he was previously, though more con sciously, committed to. Identifying the good or happiness with mainly sensate plea sure, Callicles takes the best life to be the life of pleasure, i.e., one devoted to the gratification of any and every desire. Thus for Callicles, the happiest person is the superman, namely, one who can create the largest and most intense appetites and have the courage to gratify them, uninhibited by any moral scruples. To him, therefore, injustice and intemperance are virtues, while justice and temperance are vices, being conventional mechanisms devised by the weak and inferior majority to shame the superior person into curbing his appetites, so that he does not take ad vantage of others. But, as McKim (1988: 39) has perceptively put it, "Whereas shame is for Callicles an unnatural feeling that inhibits our real preference for vice, Socrates believes to the contrary . . . that our shame about vice is a natural sign that deep down we really prefer virtue."37 Socrates shows by a series of arguments that the life of injustice and intemperance has shameful consequen ces unacceptable even to Callicles himself.38 First, if pleasure is the good or happiness, then the life of intense and continuous scratching of itches must be a happy one. The point, despite Callicles' denial (496d6-8), is that intemperate hedonism rather than entailing happiness, actually entails shameful consequen ces. Any doubt about this is disabused by the second argument: if the life of pleasure is happiness, then, the life of the cata mite?the receptive partner in a homosexual act who freely gets what he wants?is happy (494e). Callicles still protests this con sequence, but only "in order that his position is not inconsistent" (495a5-6). Apart from showing the shameful consequences of</page><page sequence="17">SOCRATIC WISDOM 139 intemperate hedonism, both arguments also show that there are intemperate hedonists?the catamite and itch-scratcher?who are not necessarily living happily. Third, Callicles had intimated that the unjust and intemper ate are happier than their opposite counterparts, because the former have the courage to gratify their uninhibited desires. Socrates now argues that given the intemperate hedonist's equa tion of pleasure and the good or happiness, the coward must enjoy just as much as (if not greater happiness than) Callicles' super man, since the pleasure the coward enjoys in running away from danger is at least as intense as the superman's pleasure in fac ing it (497d-499b). At last Callicles cannot accept the shameful consequence that, on a hedonist principle of life, the coward may be as happy as or even happier than his superman. He now be lieves, as everyone else must, that some pleasures are bad (499b4-8). By implication, he therefore concedes that temper ance is more beneficial than intemperance. What is required for happiness, then, is not brute courage, but a techne for sorting out bad pleasures from good ones (499c-500a). In these argu ments against Callicles, Socrates shows that Callicles' principle is not informed by an inductive sequence of facts?of intemper ate hedonistic lives?which severally and jointly show that intemperate hedonism entails happiness. Contrary to the belief that Socratic dialectics is of elenctic or refutative value only, the Gorgias suggests that the process of coming to know moral first principles is also a process that tends or is intended to induce self-conscious commitment to principles that entail the fine and the good on the basis of reasons that are logically/evidentially adequate. A process of this sort, if suit ably extended or done repeatedly, as Socrates suggests in the Apology,39 has a tendency to generate principles (i) as a source of motivation for conduct, (ii) that incline one to consistently act in certain ways, and (iii) constitute an ability to account for those principles or justify actions based on them. 4 Conclusions So far, then, what I have argued for is this. The knowledge that is virtue, and is necessary and sufficient for happiness, that knowledge which makes akrasia impossible, is knowledge that and how a sequence of inductive facts entail the fine and the good, or invariably produces physical/social/psychological/spiri tual benefits for one committed to them;40 and this necessarily</page><page sequence="18">140 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY includes, by implication, knowledge of facts that do not entail such benefits. To know virtue is to know what is necessary and sufficient to reproduce (say for educational purposes) those in terrelated sequence of facts that entail the fine and the good; hence, to know a virtue is to be able to justify or explain all relevantly related beliefs about that virtue.41 But to be able to justify or explain all relevantly related beliefs about a virtue is also to be able teach it. The statement of a virtue, i.e., of a foundational sort of moti vating moral belief that survives elenctic examination, and therefore entails the fine and the good, will contain an explana tion of what that virtue is, why instantiations of that virtue are such, why virtue is preferable to vice, and why the wise, the fully informed, are committed to it. The wise will be seen to be committed to it, because what entails the fine and the good is both what we all, in virtue of our humanity, implicitly wish for in whatever we do and, hence, will rationally desire once we come to know that it is in our informed interest to do so. Thus if a sequence of interrelated facts entail the fine and the good for one, then to come to have adequate, i.e., elenctic-proof reason, why it entails the fine and the good is to come to be committed to it as guaranteeing one's informed interest. Consequently, the person who knows a virtue is also one committed to it as a prin ciple of conduct that guarantees his self-interest, on the basis of evidence/reason that is logically/factually adequate.42 A coher ent system of principles which preserve, promote or enhance one's self-interest on the basis of logically/factually adequate reason self-consciously acquired would tend to constitute, not only an ability to consistently exhibit, identify or account for those prin ciples in all relevant situations, but also will be a source of motivation for conduct as well as an inclination to interpret ex ternal stimuli and to act in certain ways that would override all others less firmly grounded and inconsistent with them?invari ably with beneficial consequences. And since virtue is also an other-regarding principle of conduct, to be committed to virtue is to see one's informed self-interest as invariably grounded in the concern for others. So if to come to know a virtue is to come to be consciously commitment to it, then insofar as virtue en tails the fine and the good, the one who knows virtue will be morally inerrant, infallible and luck-independent. Hence akrasia will be impossible. University of Ghana</page><page sequence="19">SOCRATIC WISDOM 141 NOTES 1. The primary text used for this paper is John Burnet's 1900 Oxford Classical Text; the translations are mine unless otherwise stated. For the speculative chronological ordering of Plato's works, I assume Gregory Vlastos's Socrates: Ironist and Moral Philosopher (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1991), pp.46-47. 2. Reading, for example, the second protreptic of the Euthydemus (288c 293a) with Charmides 173e6-174c3. In the Apology, concern for virtue is, for Socrates, the most important thing in life, for from virtue, but not oth erwise, all other things, private and public, become goods for humans (30b2-5; cf. 29e, 38a, 31b5, 41e); and virtue is knowledge. 3. Cf. Euthydemus 280a: "wisdom always makes people fortunate: for by wisdom no man would ever err, and therefore he must act rightly and succeed, or his wisdom would be wisdom no longer.'' See also Gorgias 465a, 501a; Crito 47c8-48al; Laches 184ell-185e6; Euthydemus 280a6-b3; 281e2-5. 4. In defending the impossibility of akrasia in the Protagoras, Socrates claims that the rule of knowledge is stronger than any non-rational forces (352b-c). In the Laches and Protagoras he ignores trained capacity to do something as necessary for virtue. Thus he ignores endurance, even wise endurance (Laches 192d) as necessary for courage; and in the Protagoras, a trained diver is not braver than an untrained one on account of his training. 5. See Aristotle's critique, Magna Moralia 1182a 15-23; Eudemian Eth ics 1216b2-25. Compare the similar claim that voluntary wrongdoing is impossible (Protagoras 345d9?e4); alternatively, that "all evil is done in voluntarily" (Gorgias 509e5-7; Protagoras. 345d7-9). 6. Terry Penner, in "What Laches &amp; Nicias Miss?And Whether Socra tes Thinks Courage Is Merely A Part of Virtue" (Ancient Philosophy, vol. 12 (1992), pp. 1-27, at p. 11), wrote that "[tjhroughout the first six or seven decades of the 20th century, Anglo-American philosophers tended to sup pose that Socrates' 'What is X?' question was a request for meanings, a request for a conceptual analysis'." For the assumption that Socrates searches for essential definitions, see R. E. Allen, Plato's Euthyphro and the Earlier Theory of Forms (New York: Irwin, 1970); Plato's Ethics (Ox ford, 1995), especially pp. 25-28; C. H. Kahn, Plato and the Socratic Dialogue (Cambridge, 1996), especially p. 160; H. Benson, Socratic Wisdom (Oxford, 2000). The account I shall offer unifies more of the early period dialogues than on a definitional reading of the expected answer to his 'What is X?' questions in which case only the Euthyphro, the early part of the Meno, Charmides, and Laches are strictly relevant for understanding Socratic philosophy in action, the rest, where no such question is raised, including the Gorgias, the most informative on Socratic ethics, serving as footnotes. 7. It appears that the charge that the Socratic thesis?knowledge is vir tue?is intellectualist. is based on a species of knowledge that. Rudesbusch,</page><page sequence="20">142 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY Socrates, Pleasure &amp; Value (Oxford, 1999), pp. 4-5, claims that "Concep tual ability affects desires by enabling us, in Sidgwick's words, 'adequately to realize in imagination the nature and consequences of our choices. An adequate realization in one's imagination that an action is unkind, unfair, or base, for example, often affects the desire to perform it" (my emphasis). This statement suggests, doubtfully, that there is statistical evidence that those with conceptual ability about moral terms are "often" morally better. Is there such evidence? 8. Benson's Socratic knowledge/wisdom may be compatible with the fol lowing break-in scenario: Agent A believes that p, namely, (1) that all the occupants of bungalow number two are out at 8 p.m.; (2) p is true, in fact, because (3) A actually saw them drive away. With other supporting beliefs coherently generated by or in relation to p, A, a criminal, successfully breaks in. This being his thirtieth successful crime in succession, some of them very vicious, A is a case of a person with a mind capable of generating an interrelated coherent system of true cognitive states involving a particular object or subject matter. This suggests that, while knowledge thatp, which is the result of a mind with a capacity to generate an alethically coherent set of beliefs, may lead to successful action, it is not sufficient for being morally good, let alone for guaranteeing a happy life for oneself. I submit that the common objection to Socrates' anti-akrasia thesis?that people commonly do what they know to be wrong?appears to assimilate some spe cies of knowing that to moral knowledge of the sort envisaged by Socrates. 9. See, for example, T. C. Brickhouse and Nicholas D. Smith, Plato's Socrates (Oxford, 1994), pp. 5-10; C. D. C. Reeve, Socrates in the Apology (Indianapolis/Cambridge, 1989), pp. 37-45. 10. Cf. P. H. Hirst, "Liberal Education and the Nature of Knowledge," in The Philosophy of Education (Oxford, 1973), pp. 87-111. 11. This is clearly enough indicated by the example he gives (97a-b): that one who judges/guesses rightly the right road to a destination, though he has never traversed it and does not know it, will nevertheless be as successful a guide as the one who knows it. 12. Cf. Socrates' confident affirmation of other beliefs: Apology 29b6-7, 30a5, 30c6-8, 37a5-6, 37b5-?2, 41d3-5. 13. See Apology 20d6-9, 23a5-6; cf. 19d8-c3, 19a7-23a. 14.

Whenever Socrates has asked his "What is X?" question, he does not follow by asking his interlocutors to define (horizein, diorizein) X. Socrates always asks his interlocutors to "tell," "state," or 'say": Euthyphro, eipein? 6cl0-d2, lege, ph?is?clO, d6; Laches 190e2, 192b5?legeis, epoimi, epein; Meno Hal, lib?eip?n, eipe; Charmides 158e7?dozein. On the appearance</page><page sequence="21">SOCRATIC WISDOM 143 of horizein and cognate terms in the early dialogues of Plato see especially Kahn, op. cit., p. 171 and n. 28. 17. Textually, conditions 1, 2, and 3 are never verified separately; they occur in one and the same process of elenctic examination; they are repro duced here for analytical purposes only. 18.

The main theme of the Gorgias is explicitly stated as concerning how one ought to live (472c-d, 500c). It is in this sense that in Plato's Apol ogy Socrates claims to be examining himself and others, not mere propositions. See, for example, Apology 21c35, 23b4-6, 23c4, 28e5-6, 29e4 5, 39c7. Cf. Laches 187e, where Nicias said of Socrates: "anyone who is close to Socrates and enters into conversation with him is liable to be drawn into an argument, and whatever subject he may start with, he will be con tinually carried round and round by him, until at last he finds that he has to give an account both of his present and past life." Cf. also Gorgias 482b4-6. 21. Euthyphro. 9d7-8; Crito 49cll-dl; Protagoras 331c4-dl; Laches 193c6-8; Republic 1.349a4-8. Twice Socrates rebukes Gorgias for answer ing him contrary to his beliefs?Gorgias 499bc, 500b; also 457d-bl, 470c. On sincere assent of the interlocutors see Benson, op. cit., pp. 37-55. Con trast J. Beversluis, Cross-Examining Socrates (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), pp. 37-58. 22. Indeed, Socrates calls virtue lawfulness and law (nomimom and nomon, Gorgias 504d. 23. See, e.g., Gorgias 468c4-7; Meno 77b ff. 24. There are several other purposes of the elenchos including the search for truth and wisdom, and the removal of false conceit of knowledge (Charmides, 166c7-e2). 25. A situation involving the operation of justice or piety may not di rectly involve physical well-being, though it will conduce to it, given the principle of the unity of the virtues. Crito (54b) suggests that justice conduces to one's spiritual well-being, though in the peculiar situation of the Crito, Socrates' acting justly will gain spiritually but lose his physical existence. Cf. Gorgias 507a6-cl0. 26. Cf. Euthyphro 7e6?7: "The things one considers fine, good and just one loves, and the opposite is what he hates." 27. We do not need to go along with Kahn (op. cit., pp. 223-224) to Plato's theory of desire and his doctrine of philosophic eros in order to find how philosophic wisdom can be so effective as a motive force, since Socrates expects his wise person to carry a species of moral principles, which al ready carries his desires, expectations, etc. For if an interlocutor is committed to a principle, because he perceives the (a)-component of the</page><page sequence="22">144 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY principle as invariably beneficial, then lust, fear, and such other irrational imperatives are sublimated in that perception. Consequently, we need not be struck by Socrates' apparent lack of enthusiasm in giving distinct con sideration to the non-rational factors in human motivation. 28. Not all the elenchi answer to following pattern; but we might still rea sonably consider this typical of the elenctic examination of individual virtues. 29. That virtues must be fine (kalon), good (agathon), and beneficial (ophelimon), see Charmides, 159cl; Eutyhdemus 278e5-282d3; Laches 192c5-7; Meno 87el-3, Protagoras 349e3-5, 359e4-7. 30. (5) may be any empirical counter-example in some elenchus, depend ing on the interlocutor's p. Cf. Laches 190e4-191c6. In the early period dialogues, except for the Gorgias, this premise is generally granted by the interlocutors without challenge. Cf. Meno 87d, where Socrates says, "Well, then, do we assert that virtue is something good? Is that assumption a firm one for us?" Meno: "Undoubtedly." Socrates: "First, then, is it virtue which makes us good?" Meno: "Yes." Socrates: "And if good then beneficial? All good things are beneficial, are they not?" Meno: "Yes." In my view, then, Gregory Vlastos's ("The Socratic Elenchus," Oxford Studies in Ancient Phi losophy, vol. 1, pp. 27-58) so-called problem of the elenchos does not arise?the problem, namely, how can Socrates claim to have proved that the refutand, p, is false, when all he has established is the inconsistency of the premises of the elenchos and refutand. For the refutand, p, at (2) is refuted at (3) and (5) both logically and factually: logically because it is inconsistent with another of the interlocutor's belief (7/8), but also factu ally because the inconsistency is in respect of non-entailment of beneficial consequences of p (5/6). Contrast Benson (op. cit., p. 155), for whom indi vidual elenchi can do no more than establish inconsistency in the interlocutor's beliefs. 31. The self-interest that is encoded in interlocutors' answers to the Socratic "What is X?" question may not always be obvious. But Kahn (op. cit., p. 188) in his usual sensitivity to the dramatic form of the early dia logues has noted that "Charmides has just displayed the modesty that is appropriate for a young man in the company of his elders, by blushing when he was asked about his own s?phrosun? and avoiding anything that might resemble self-praise (158c5-d6). His second answer in terms of shame or modesty is thus an accurate reading of what he sees in himself as temperance.'' 32. Cf. especially Socrates' question: what noble product does our ser vice to the gods help to produce? (13e6-8). Euthyphro could not tell exactly, but said: "Knowing how to pray and sacrifice to the gods?this saves the family and the state" (14b2-7). At this point, Socrates remarks that Euthyphro "could have summed up what he had asked for much more briefly," and that Euthyphro was "on the point of telling him [what piety is], and, then, slipped away" (14b8-c3). Some Socratic scholars tend to see here a connection with Socrates' claim in the Apology that, in searching for wisdom, he was serving or assisting god by helping to induce moral ratio</page><page sequence="23">SOCRATIC WISDOM 145 nality in others. See, for example, Brickhouse and Smith, 1994; M. L. McPherran, "Socratic Piety in the Euthyphro" in Critical Assessments of Leading Philosophers, vol. 11 (London: Routledge, 1996), pp. 118-143. Con trast Reeve (op. cit.,pp. 64-65 and n. 74), who briefly but effectively disposes of the tendency to read "service to the gods" as part of what piety is, insist ing on Socrates' fundamental belief that piety is a sort of moral knowledge. This is quite consistent with the account I offer here. See also R. Kraut, Socrates and the State (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1984), pp. 250-251. 33. Cf. Charmides 175e5-176al. Irwin (op. cit., p. 20) is right in saying that the interlocutor need not abandon his proposition, unless he believes more deeply the other propositions that refute his initial proposition. 34. For example, Socrates' principle of non-retaliation against all wrongs suffered is anti-dozastic. So too is the principle that it is better to suffer injustice than to do it (Crito 49d2-5; Gorgias 474b2-5). 35. If virtue is knowledge (Meno 87d2-89a5, Protagoras 329b5-334c5, 349a6-361d6)ofgood and bad (Laches 197el0-199el2; Charmides 174bll c3), and "good" and "bad" are, on my reading, the same as consequential social/psychological/physical/spiritual benefits and harms of one's actions, then Socrates' commitment to benchmark beliefs based on their elenctically inductive validity places him at a high level on the scale of moral rational ity. One demonstration of this is the Crito, where Socrates offers an argument morally far more advanced than Crito's. Perhaps the result of applying elenctically enduring principles in his life is what Xenophon ably captured in his photographic portraiture of Socrates: He disciplined his mind and body by such course of life that he who should adopt a similar one, would, if no supernatural influence pre vented, live in good spirits and uninterrupted health; and he would never be in want of the necessary expenses for it; for he was so fru gal that I do not know whether anyone could earn so little by the labor of his hands, that would not procure sufficient goods to have satisfied Socrates. (Memo, ii., 1-7) Even if Xenophon here exaggerates about Socrates, it remains a fact that whoever lives such a course of life would answer almost exactly to the de scription of the temperate person in the Gorgias (507a6?clO), who, we are told, "pursues and refrains from what he ought to," "does what is fitting," and "perseveres in what he ought to." It is also reasonable to suppose that the commitment to and application of elenctically justified principles ex plain Socrates' equally confident claim to goodness in the Apology (37a5-6, 41c8-d6), in the Gorgias (522d)?where he says that he is confident he has never wronged anyone, man or god?and in the Apology (37a6-7, b4-5)? where he claims that he is convinced he has never knowingly wronged anyone. Contrast Benson, op. cit., pp. 243-249. 36. This implication, that moral knowledge may be attained in degrees, and that there are different moral personalities corresponding to these levels</page><page sequence="24">146 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY QUARTERLY of knowledge, appears to be threatened by a number of passages (e.g., Meno 86d3-el; Euthyphro 6e3-6; Laches 190b7-c2, 189e3-190bl; Hippias Major 286c5-d7, 304d5-e3) generally understood to exhibit a principle according to which, without having knowledge of what virtue is, you cannot truly know anything about virtue. If this is true, then, the knowledge that is virtue is an all-or-nothing affair, and further, that we cannot account for differences in moral personalities. I think, however, that this understand ing of the texts is mistaken. Let us briefly look at a typical example of the said principle at Meno 71b3-8, where Socrates says, in answer to the ques tion whether virtue is teachable: I have no knowledge about virtue at all (parapari). And how can I know a property of something when I don't even know what it is? Do you suppose that somebody totally ignorant of who Meno is (gign?skei to parapan hostis estin) could say whether he is fine and rich and well-born or not? Is that possible? This is a reasonable claim that it is impossible to know anything about Meno?whether he is fine, rich or well born?if you know absolutely noth ing about who Meno is? Surely, Athenians who were acquainted with Meno knew something about Meno, and could conclusively answer the question whether Meno was fine or rich or well born. In any case, the passage clearly indicates that to know whether Meno is fine, rich and well born is part of what it is to know who Meno is. Surely this sort of knowledge about Meno is not a complete knowledge of who Meno is?because, for example, it will not answer other questions about Meno, as for example, "What is Meno's charac ter?" Therefore, the passage implies that there are different kinds or levels of knowledge of who Meno is. In context, what Socrates implies in the above passage is that he does not have that kind or level of knowledge about virtue that would adequately answer the question whether virtue is teachable. Generalizing about similar passages about virtue, the apparent Socratic claim, "If you do not know what X is, you cannot know that X is y," means only that a kind or level of knowledge of what X is, is necessary to know that X is y. This leaves room for other levels or kinds of knowledge of what X is that would be required to answer other questions about X. Accordingly, it is possible to have some knowledge about virtue. If so, different moral person alities may be seen as exemplifying various degrees of moral knowledge. 37. Cf. Kahn (op. cit., p. 138), who, speaking about the role of shame in the triple refutation of Gorgias, Polus, and Callicles, says, "Shame reflects a Platonic conception corresponding to our own notion of an innate moral sense, but which Plato describes as a universal desire for the good. . . . Shame operates in this dialogue as an obscure intuition of the good on the part of Socrates' interlocutors. ... It must be on an intuition of this sort that Socrates was relying in his claim that Polus or Callicles will inevita bly agree with him or be in disagreement with themselves. For (as Socrates says), everyone desires the good." In the Crito, consequential shame fol lowing escape from prison plays an important role in Socrates' decision not to escape. See, e.g., Crito 53c5?dl, 53el.</page><page sequence="25">SOCRATIC WISDOM 147 38. I shall not be concerned with all the arguments, or with the order in which they were presented. 39. At Apology 38a, Socrates suggests that it takes more than one elenctic encounter to induce in an Interlocutor or in oneself a reasonable degree of moral rationality, when he tells the jury: "I tell you that by dis cussing daily goodness and all the other subjects about which you hear me talking and examining both myself and others is really the best thing that a man can do, and that life without this sort of examination is not worth living." And, in the Crito, Socrates' prolonged experience in dialectical self education appears to have informed his decision not to escape from prison, when to do so would violate his avowed, elenctically enduring principles (Crito 46b ff.). 40. According to Kahn (op. cit., p. 209), "What began in the Laches and Charmides and continued in the Meno and Euthydemus as a search for beneficial knowledge, knowledge of the correct use of instrumental goods, finds its climax here at the end o? Republic VI, in appeal to knowledge of the Good itself." I hope I have shown rather that the search for beneficial knowledge generally, and not just knowledge of the correct use of instru mental goods, is the essence of Socratic philosophy in the early dialogues. 41. But, as the Meno suggests, on my reading at any rate, it does not follow that every true belief about virtue must presuppose knowledge of virtue as a whole. Repeated elenctic examination can be one reliable source of attaining true beliefs about virtue. 42. According to Benson (op. cit., p. 155), a definitional knowledge of virtue is supported in the Gorgias at 464e2-465a7, and again at 500e3? 501b 1, on the ground that an essential feature of expertise, as opposed to a knack, is that the former can give a logos of the nature of its object or subject matter, as well as explain what he does, whereas a knack cannot. But this is not necessary. If "the nature of a subject-matter" is that which explains all instances ofthat subject-matter, then I hope I have shown that a foundational sort of motivating moral belief can explain all occurrences of a virtue. The interlocutor, if truly an expert, is expected to be able to state and justify such a belief under elenctic examination, by showing that the empirical component of that belief entails the fine and the good.</page></plain_text>
