As such, he is regarded as the Second Pir/Patron Saint of Mawlawism. After the death of Celebi Husâm al-Dïn, Sultán Walad agreed to succeed to the leadership and in this way established the status of Celebism in Mawlawism. Sultan Walad, a man of reason, pursued the example of his father without much enthusiasm. He presented his father's teachings to the people in a didactic manner. Along with his father, he was a devoted disciple of Shams of Tabriz. Consequently, he could have been as exuberant and vivacious as Shams; however, he chose not to be. Instead, he became a man of reason probing to unite the inner and outer worlds and avoiding extremist mystical ideas. He did not want to talk about delicate mystical matters, passing over these kinds of matters in sentences like, "The pen wrote this far, and then it broke;" "For the wise, a sign is sufficient" and "There are many secrets hidden in this. But it is not allowed to utter them." This is to be seen in his MaârifanA Intihà-nâma, his works contain his sermons and counsels respectively. Keywords Sultan Walad, Ma'ârif, secrets of Sufis, Mawlawism, populism, theosophical Sufism Sultan Walad was the son of the renowned Turkish Sufi, poet and philoso pher Mawlànà Djalàl al-Dïn Rûmï (623/1226-712/1312). His full name was Muhammad (or Mahmad) Bahâ al-Dïn Ibn Mawlànà Djalàl al-Dïn Sultán Walad. Considering his lifetime (623/1226-712/1312), we may say that Sultan Walad witnessed the most magnificent years of the Selcuk Empire, as well as its decline under the Mongol invasion. The period between the 7/13th Century and the beginning of the 8/14th Century in which Sultán Walad lived coincides with the period known as the Golden Age of Sufism in which the founders of the great Sufi orders lived. Sultán Walad's works include the Mathnawiyât-e Waladiyya1 (Ibtidâ-nàma, Rabâb-nàma and Intiha Mathnawiyât-e Waladiyyn consists of 25,450 couplets.

There are certain other Works, such as the Ishq-ndma, Khashiya 'ala Sharh-e 'Isâghodji, Ghazdliyyàt, Ath'âr, Risala der Bayân-e Mutafarrika, Der Marifat-e Âfâk-t Anfus, Risdla-e Insha, etc., which are accredited to him but to date his authorship of these Works has yet to be proved (Kiiçiik, 2005: 54-75). In fact, Sultan Walad did not want to Write books at ail. If he wrote, he wrote to follow the example of his father and on the insistence of his close friends, as in the case of his Dïwân, [btidd-ndma, Rabdb-ndma and the Madrif ] or to be bénéficiai to people by his sermons and preaching, as in his Intihd-ndma (Kiiçiik, 2005: 55-65). Furthermore, being bénéficiai to people necessitates speaking explicitly: "For Sultan Walad, who was not a man of art, intellect and reason were always in high regard. He did not follow his feel ings. So Sultan Walad could not be expected to author a literary work. Indeed, the aim of composing such a work was not his ultimate goal; quite the contrary, being didactic was important for him. Therefore, he felt himself obliged to be explicit in his statements" (Gibb, 1958: 153; Garabeiglou, 1977: 24). This is clearly evident in ail of his mathnawis: He placed explana tory texts in prose between the headings, to make the topic much more understandable. He turned his fathers rhetorical Sufism into a didactic one (Olken, 1934: 253).Informed by this approach, his poems show certain lack of exuberance, ecstasy and fascinating descriptions (Gdlpinarli, 1983: 53). Sultan Walad pointed out that he had no knowledge other than what his father taught him in the following couplets: ولدرا يث كب ِءام ي ولاين حزآلمولأبمكشمرداد (al-Aflâkï,1980:Il, 815). However, it should be kept in mind that Sultan Walad did not just repeat his fathers thoughts, but rather reinterpreted and rephrased them in a manner that people could easily comprehend (Walley, 1898: 436). It is known that Sultan Walad agreed to succeed Celebi Husam al-Dîn after his death in 683/1284 and, in this way, established the status of Celebism2 in Mawlawism, thus preventing any discord that might emerge close to the number of couplets in his father Rümí's Mathanawi (which is 25,632 couplets). It should be kept in mind here that Sultan Walad had always wanted to imitate his father, as will be stated further in this article. ل In Mawlawism, maie descendants of Rùrnï's sons are called "Celebi." Later, in spite of dis putes because of waqfi, sometimes maie descendants of his daughters also got this title. The later ones are rather called Indth (female) Celebis (Golpmarh, 1983: 367).</page><page sequence="3">62 H. Kûçiik !Asian Journal of Social Science 38 (2010) 60-78 from the chaos. Uzluk, in praising his attitude in this matter, says that he pro vided unity in Mawlawism, and ail the benefits that theTurkish-Islamic world have accrued benefitted from it was the work of this union (1941: 20, 28). Gdlptnarli emphasises that Sultan Walads work of organising Mavlawism was done to spread the philosophy of Mawlànâ, although this work did not entirely accommodate his fathers understanding of Sufism (Gôlpinarli, 1983: 64). In his own words in Ibtidà'-nàma, Sultan Walad says (1355/1936: 155-158): حلناء ساحت درشق يدر َؤد درثمِكسرور (He appointed substitutes to his fathers way; he sent revered persons to each station) حلناءيرثلنل اندررؤم ١ مما تلكس رمحا خروم (Anatolia became fiill of substitutes so that no one became bereft of us) ريأص •١ لمهجمانعخم ئر#جومزانهماندرشم (In fact, not only Anatolia, every corner of the world became flili of substitutes; from this ocean a drop flew to every corner of the world) ممزكسند ممدا يمرا هم،لكشحويثرا سرا (Every substitute became eligible to be followed; they ail gained merit from being sheikhs and guides) تا سم يهرمان سمأ (so that we wrote down for them idjazas). It was Sultan Walad who made Rüml's great followers renowned by citing them in his Works. He says in his Ibtidánama■. "Mawlana had great substi tutes, such as Shams al-Dïn, Sheikh Salah al-Dïn, Husam al-Dïn, but they had not been renowned for their saintliness, greatness and high knowledge until Walad related their qualities. Their saintliness and greatness hidden pre viously; became apparent" (Sultan Walad, 1355/1936: 158). It should be remembered here that in some Mawlawi lineages, names of these people are not mentioned (Gdlpinarli, 1963: 18), and in some lineages, only Celebi Husam al-Dln is mentioned (Gdlpinarli, 1983: 152-153). In most cases, Sultán Walads name mostly follows Rümi's name. This shows his elevated place in Mawlawism. Although we do not have any information concerning the formation of Mawlawism as an Order (Gdlpinarh, 1983: 18), it would not be wrong to say that .. the organisation of the Order began during Sultán Walads time, and took its final shape in the 10th/l6th Century" (Gdlpinarh, 1983: 288).</page><page sequence="4">H. Kiiçiik I Asian Journal of Social Science 38 (2010) 60-78 63 So Sultan Walad lived in the period in which the organisation of Sufi Orders in general, was still developing. Sultan Walad, uniting his father's Kubrawiyya with the exuberance he assumed from Shams of Tabriz, established a new Order.3 Sultan Walad was extremely attached to ceremonies and rituals (Golpinarh, 1983: 40). His appointment of substitutes who taught his fathers teachings to the people was a sign of this type of character. This paved the way to other works concerning the organisation of the Order. Being a man of self-possession and reason, and behaving in accordance with the con ditions of the time, he organised Mawlawism disregarding that in doing so he was changing his fathers way (Golpinarh, 1983: 45). He did not hold exuberance and love in high regard, otherwise he could not have rendered Mawlawism into an Order (Golpinarh, 1983: 39). Hilmi Ziya Ülken is of the idea that: "Sultán Walad, who cannot be called a high philosopher and artist like his father, was a man of organisation and an ardent believer in his fathers way." Thanks to these attributes, he forged Mawlànà's intellectual and literary movement into a powerful organisation" (Ülken, 1934: II, 185). Ülken adds that all these changes were made during a very critical period when political disturbances, such as when the Mongol invasion and the Kara manoghlus' occupation of Konya and environs were happening. Had Sultán Walad not been so resolute, he would not have been successful (Ülken, 1934: II, 185). Systemising Rümí's teaching could only have been possible by outlin ing this unity and humanity, based on exuberance and the sama, ecstacy and love, music and dance. Sultán Walad did this with his mystical character (Golpinarh, 1983: 64). But Golpinarh is wrong when he thinks that Sultán Walad did that with his mystical character, since systemising necessitates rea son and intellect, not a mystical character. Furthermore, he was avoiding extremist mystical ideas, as will be stated further in this article. However, it should be emphasised here that Sultán Walad's exact role in establishing Mawlawi rituals and basic principles is not precisely known (cfr. Walley, 1898:435). First of all, pertinent to Dawr-e Waladis4 name and Mawlawi sources' claims on that issue (see, for instance, Top, 2001: 224), it is not entirely accurate to say that it was Sultán Walad who rendered the sama into mukâbala, i.e., the ceremonial sama. The truth is that the sama during the 3 Gôlpinarh, does not mention Kubrawiyya; he states Malàmatiyya instead. He also claims that Ibn 'Arab! and Rümí differed in their understanding of Sufism (see Gôlpinarh, 1983: 305; Idem., 1999: 44-118). However, according to the author of the present work, all Sufis empha sised the same reality, and differed only in the way of conveying it. 4 Dawr-i Waladi is a name given to part of the sama when the dervishes go around the sama square thrice accompanied by the peshrew, the opening music (for more detailed information, see Gôlpinarh, 1983: 375).</page><page sequence="5">64 H. Kiiçiik /Asian Journal oj Social Science 38 (2010) 60—78 time of Sultan Walad, or even during the Ulu Àrif Celebi (d. 719/1320) period, remained the same as the sama during Rûmî's lifetime. In the Manâkib al-Ârifîn, a source which includes the Sultan Walad period and that of his grandson EmlrÀdil Celebi (d. 739/1338), no mention is made of such a ceremonial sama (cfr. Gôlpinarh, 1963: 73; Idem., 1983: 282). In the tra ditions concerning the sama during Sultan Walad's time, mention has been made of their being extremely long (see, for instance, al-Aflàkl, 1980: 840-841, 900-901), but nothing else was mentioned. According to the com monly agreed view, the sama took its final shape during the life time of PlrAdil Celebi' (d. 865/1460) (Gôlpinarh, 1983: 100, 204, 383). Also, three ceremonial musical styles called Husaynï, dugâh and pangâh were used in Mawlawl ceremonies until the 17th Century. Although it was claimed that these ceremonial musical styles were set to music by Rùmï or Sultan Walad, it is certain that they belong to the 16th Century, since they are set to music for a full ceremony (Gôlpinarh, 1983: 456). Sultan Walad, like his father, was a devoted disciple of Shams of Tabriz (Sipahsàlàr, 1325: 123, 149; al-Aflâkî, 1980: 621, 633, 644—645). Conse quently, he could have been as exuberant and vivacious as Shams but he chose not to. Instead, became a man of reason probing to unite the inner and outer worlds and avoiding extremist mystic ideas. There is a common misunderstanding that this situation caused a schism in Mawlawism into the branch of Shams and the branch of Walad, and claiming that the branch of Shams was a 'way of love', whereas Sultan Walad's way was that of ascetism'. Nevertheless, this kind of description is not plau sible since Sultan Walad was a disciple of Shams. Shams even said one day, "I gave my head to Mawlânà, and my secret to Sultan Walad" (Câmî, 1995: 646; Gôlpinarh, 1983: 208-209). Furthermore, it is Sultan Walad who said: "On the day of resurrection, Shams al-Dïn and I will be resurrected together in a unique way, apart from other people" (Sultan Walad, 1355/1936: 290). Hiiseyin Vassal (d. 1929) also shows that he did not perceive Sultan Walad as being different from Shams, when he says: "Sultan Walad was always in awe of being captured by ecstasy. Most of the time, he was dominated by enthusi asm and rapture, and was drunk with Allah's love" (Hiiseyin Vassaf, 1990: 320). However, this verdict neglects Sultan Walad's being self possessed and dominated by reason. In my opinion, he was inwardly like Shams, even much more exuberant than him, whereas outwardly he was a reasoning Sufi, shun ning extreme manifestations of love. I say, "Much more exuberant than him/ Shams," since, for instance, although Shams considered Hallàdj as a Sufi who could not attain the degree of certainty and blamed him for displaying exu berance (see Shams-e Tabrlzî, n.d.: 83b, 153a), Sultan Walad spoke in favor</page><page sequence="6">H. Kûçiikا Asian journal of Social Science 38 (2010) 60 78 65 of Halladj: In h ؛s Ma drlf and other Works, Sultan Walad holds chose Sufis who were always influenced by the ideas oí fana (annihilation) and sakr/sukr (intoxication), in high regard, like Bayazid Bistami (d. 261/874) (Sultan Walad, 1350(1931): 17, 29, 33, 57, 191, 212, 227, 265, 286; Idem., 1079 h.: 16a) and Halladj (Sultan Walad, 1350(1931): 9, 57, 158; Idem., I079h.: 16a), and recourses to their shatahdt (theopathic locutions),5 such as 1• محاز أعظم شاش (Glory be to Me!; How great is My case), أناالحق (I am the قام/ Creative Truth). For instance, in his Maârif he makes mention of Halladj s crucifixion twice (Idem., 1350(1931): 9, 158) and praises him as being "sacred and unique," adding that the people who executed him spread his ashes on river, but soon after, seeing that his blood from the ashes took the shape of his words "الخق Ú" on the water, became sorry for what they did. Therefore, until the day of résurrection, there will be no assembly in which his name is not memorised and mentioned (Idem., 1350(1931): 9). It should be remembered here that in Mawlawism, the words of Halladj always became an allusion to nay,6 and the term of nay-e Mansitr (Mansurs nay) came into the usage (seeTatçi, 1994: 58 73). In Sultan Walads Maârif Djunaid al-Bagdadi (d. 297/909), a master of Sahw (sobriety),7 is mentioned only twice ((Sultan Walad, 1350(1931): 9). In fact, Djunaid shared the same ideas with the abovementioned people and also had some theopathic locutions ascribed to him (Baldi, 1374/1995: 158 162). In any case he tended to be secretive and did not make any disclosures on mystical topics. Djunaid would shut the doors while speaking about elu sive mystical topics. In one of his letters to a friend, he said, "It is necessary to be compassionate towards people, and not to tell them things that they cannot comprehend. Telling them things that they do not know and address ing them with things that they cannot comprehend, is not a way showing mercy to them" (Ate?, n.d.: 63 64). Sultan Walad was of the same idea in this matter. Thus, he might have mentioned him much more frequently than the other Sufis. To che confusion of the reader, he did not do this. Essentially, the followingstatement indicares that he held ail of these Sufis to be the same, when he says: "People denied scholars and saints of that time like Mansiir-e Halladj, Shibli (d. 334/945) and Djunaid. They even decided to kill him" (Sultan Walad, 1350(1931) : 9). It is no wonder for instance that أ Shatahat (theopathic locutions) is the plural of ضهءءح/ت. Ihey are words 0؛ saints said in a theopathetic State. '' A reed flute played especially in Mawlawl music. 7 It is the State of consciousness, awakening from sakr/sukr, intoxication.</page><page sequence="7">66 H. Kiiçûk / Aiian Journal ofSocial Science 38 (2010) 60-78 Djunaid was among che Sufis from whom Shibli received Sufism, that is, Djunaid was in the Sufi lineage of Shibl؛ (al-Kushairi, 1413/1993: 297). Accordlng to Gdlpinarh, it would be much more accurate to think of rwo tendencies in Mawlawism rather than two branches. So, in Mawlawism, there are no actual branches. Even che people who made important modifications in the Mawlawiyya were not perceived as establishing another branch of Mawlawism. For instance, Âdil (؛elebi, who established the sama in its latest form, is called only Pir (patron saint) instead of Pïr-e Thânî (the Second founder). Similarly, other people who made certain modifications in the orders rules were not deemed Owner of the Mawlawi Branch or alMudjtahid.fi alTarikah (the Expounder of the Order), nor were their names even men tioned as persons who made a significant contribution to the Orders rules. So, it is true that in Mawlawism there are no 'branches', but 'tendencies', that is tendencies from the orthodox and conservative Nakshibandiyya-e Khalidiyya, to the unconventional Imamiyya, or 'Alawl. However; Mawlawls themselves and other people of Sufi orders hold the conservative ones as belonging to the Walad Branch, and the 'Alawi as belonging to the Shams Branch (Gdlpinarli, 1977: 314 315). But to Gdlpinarli, himself, ail the Mawlawls can be deemed as 'people of malamat (reproach)', whereas people of other Sufi orders are called simply 'Sufi dervishes' (Gdlpinarh, 1977: 298). Nevertheless, Mawlana describes himself as Sufi in the following couplet (Rurni, 1993: V, 224b): حمازسآبمحوندراتسم (We are Sufis, put off our vest. Since we relinquished, we do not take it back) However, in some Ma'¿rt/copies, we see Sultan Walad distinguish himself as being différent from Sufis saying, "Sufis interpret this verse differently... As to us." If it is rendered correctly in theTurkish (see Sultan Walad, 1974: 77),8 in this phrase Sulfan Walad does not see himself as a Sufi. As it is known, the dervishes who subjected themselves to public reproach by disregarding the outward rites of Islam, were called maiàmï or malamati, and the rest were called Sufi. The latter were mostly to be found in Iraq, and therefore also called Iraqls, whereas the Malamatis were to be found in Khorasan, and con sequently called Saints of Khorasan or Khorasanis from where Sufi orders like 8 Since Anbarcioglu does not mention exactly which copy she used in her translation, but rather gives a list of copies she referred to. In the Mevlana Museum Archieves copy, we could not find the sentences alluding to this differentiation.</page><page sequence="8">H. Kûçiik / Aùan Journal ofSocial Science 38 (2010) 60 78 67 Kalandarism, Haydarism, Mawlawism, and Bektashism emerged (Gdlpinarh, .(298 ,267 226 :1977 Both Sufis and Malamatis are very mindful when it cornes to expressing their mystical ideas and divine secrets in public and, therefore, they use sev eral techniques to avoid any misunderstanding. These techniques include using metaphorical narration and symbols, having recourse to esoteric corn mentary and the science of letters (Ilm aiHurùfy or conveying it directly in spécial treatises.'0 In fact, ail the Sufi books are full of divine secrets when we consider that early Sufi books are composed to explain the symbols and secrets in an appropriate way. For instance, alHudjwïri maintains that he composed his book to explain the Sufi symbols and rules to follow their way (al-Hudjwlri, 1374 [1954]: 34). Sultan Walad sometimes uses esoteric commentaries and symbols in trans mitting his Sufic thoughts to people. Although he is aware of the science of letters (see Sultan Walad, 1376: 175), he does not have recourse to it as far as we know. Only once he indicares to it when says that ail the letters are living beings through the (universal) Soul (see Sultan Walad, 1376: 303). He mostly chooses to indicare directly to the issue that he wants to explain using some clichés. In a detailed analysis of Sultan Walads Maârif and Intihanama, which are compilations of his sermons and counsels respectively, and thus include ail aspects of his Sufi thoughts, we observe his methodology in con veying mystical matters to people as the following: Talking in Accordance with the Intellectual Level of the Listener Sultán Walad, always repeats that a mans speech is sign of his level of inteb lect and, as Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) indicated, people are like mines in variety: سم\دنكو\دنسبوامحة (People are mines, like gold and silver) (Sultan Walad, 1350(1931): 236, 256)." Those who see God, see Him 'ر The science of the letters was a weil-known science among Muslim scholars. However, Ibn Arabi can be deemed as a forerunner of this science in Muslim world. Besides a chapter, that is Chapter 2, in his al-Futahat alMakkiyya (Cairo, nd.), he composed many spécial epistles on the subject, like Kitdb al-bà (author s copy, Konya Yusufaga Library, no: 4868/2), محةءهسه wa al-gbàyât (Tahran, 1376), etc. 10 The instances contain al-Suhrawardls (d. 632/1234) alRahik alMakttùm (Siileymaniye, Mahmud Efendi, 2682/1, etc.); Ibn 'Arabl's, Kashfalsetrliahlabsirr, and his Risalafiasrdr Zdt هاوز;ءإءم-/ه (both in Risdlat alwudjùdiyya, Beirut, 1425/2004, Pp. 209-222, 189-208), etc. " With some discrepancies, the ضءرس is narrated in: al-Bukharl, 1981: Anbiya, 19/ Manakib,l, 25; Muslim, 1981: Fadail al-Sahaba, 199.

Kûçiik / Asian Journal ofSocial Science 38 (2010) 60-78 in accordance with their compréhension. Everything, from an ant to King Solomon, reflects Gods attributes but ail are on a diffèrent level. For instance, although Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) ascended to heaven together with GabrieJ, Gabriel stopped when he came to a certain station saying: "لو دوت انلة لأحرقت (Should I approach a knot further, I would be burnt)."'2 Peoples compréhension of the Quran is likewise diffèrent than each other. Prophet Ibrahlms définition of the stars, moon and Sun as Allah (the Quran, alAn am 6/79) was also a reflection of his intellectual State. To understand a thing, it is necessary to comprehend the inward; since although the outward informs whar is inward, the inward cannot be comprehended by everybody (Sultan Walad, 1350(1931): 83). Therefore, Sultan Walad, always preserved his self-possession, and when it came to obscure theosophical détails, used the following clichés: العاقل يمه الإشارة (For the wise, a sign is sufficient) (Idem.: 5, 56, 126, 222, 295)'3 or اما عائلانازاناندك 0ارممكثز وءافلأنازبمار انمكءهمَكت (The wise under stand much from little, as to the unwary, they understand little from much) (Idem.: 27), or quoted the hadith: ؛آكلموا الاس عل قرر عنولهم لا عل قرر ع،زولكم (Talk to the people in accordance with tneir intellectual level, not at your level) (Idem.: 95, 226, 295), and while talking on subjects that not everybody is capable of understanding, did not give ail the détails but just says: ئرا١^٢٥ اسرار ان دسوربث (There are many secrets hidden under this matter. But it is not allowed to utter them) (Idem.: 207), نيرودوديمتنىنيإ (These things that we told and that we will tell, are your States The rest are not compréhensible by the brain, so we do not utter them) (Idem.: 284), ثيح ابن درازست. أآِكسه شوي عملها ير مابر انكانكٌ رمرنر واقف اين فرر "الناس ب دن ق الخير والثم حارمم ذابمبأحارم ق الأسلأم اذا فنهوا" (People are like mines in good ancf evil. Tliose who were rigfiteous, are also good in Islam as long as they became learned inreligiousmattersial-Adjlûni, 1351h.:ll, 312). ١ 1ل Witli a small discrepancy, the fiill hadith is as the (ollowing: "1ناكىملااأة.ءلمهود بنبااسهمرزدزتاما لأحرقت": The Prophet (PBUH) asked Gabriel: "Did you see your Lord?" Gabriel looked a lit tle vexed and said: o Muhammad! Between I and He there are seventy veils of light. Should I beeome nearer, I would be burnt). (See al-Dhahabi, 1413: VI, 241). For anorher version, see al-Isfahani, 1405: ٧, 55. " This epigram is also mentioned in Mntlinqwl (؛¿ee Rûmï, 1993: IV, I68a). 14 With the beginning of "..امتاناحاطباكاس" (To people...

(Idem.: 227, 239).15 As an illustration, Sultan Walad uses these clichés and phrases: (a) "If there is someone in the village, a sound/letter would be enough", "For the wise a sign is sufficient" or "The wise understand much from little."'6 a. Example 1: Worshipping and obeying God are like finding a trea sure. If there is someone in the village, a sound/letter would be enough. If not, shouting would be wasted (Sultan Walad, 1376: 34). b. Example 2: The root of the matter is action. Knowledge is nearer to action than prayer and fasting. There are différent ways to under stand the essence of différent things. For instance, coppers resis tance to fire does not show that it is gold; the one who really knows gold, tests it (with a touchstone), and then accepts it; he/she does not resort to other ways. Just as the Prophet Muammad (PBUH^says: إن ان لايطر ال صوركم ولااإاءععاهم وسّطر ال ظؤكم وياكم (Allah does not look at your shapes and deeds, but to your hearts and intensions) (Muslim, 1981: Birr, 32, 33; etc.). For the wise a sign is sufficient (Kurkcubashi-Zàda and Muazzin Kafawi, ms. 1179: 6b). c. Example 3: Those who have little capacity of the Main Light17 can not tear the veil of existence, and those who have much more from this light, can get rid of the veil (...) Gods actions and ways are ن Compare these sentences with: "The pen wrote this far, and then it broke!" (Rurni, 1342: 100; Idem., 2000:180). Compare these sentences with: "Those who truly understand a little, understand much; of one thing, many things; of one line, whole volumes" (RirmT, 1342: 29-30, 74-75؛ Idem., 2000:53-54, 133-134). 17 By "the Main Light" he means God. This notion is best treated in al-Ghazzalls (d. 505/1111) مسءءأ،-مح؛سئ/سم (Beirut, 1414/1994 in Maájmü âtu Rasailallmàm al-Ghazzdll,</page><page sequence="11">70 H. Kiigiik / Asian Journal of Social Science 38 (2010) 60—78 unlimited. The unlimited cannot be interpreted; since interpreta tion and comment are limited, and the unlimited cannot be con tained by the limited. Nevertheless, the wise understand much from little. But as for the unwary, they understand little from much (Sultan Walad, 1350(1931): 27; Kurkcubashi-Zada and Muazzin Kafawl, 1179: 51b). d. Example 4: Gods place of sight (nazargah) is saints' soul. Every beauty reached to their soul is a greeting from their Beloved/God. The secret in this sentence cannot be told. However, for the wise a sign is suffirent (Sultan Walad, 1376: 50. See also pp. 100, 290). e. Example 5:لأإله،الأاهة means that man should see everything through Allah, and see other things inferior to Him. There is no end to the commentary of this topic. For the gnostic (arif) a sign is sufficient (Sultan Walad, 1376: 30. As it is seen, here the Word "wise" in the phrase "for the wise a sign is sufficient" is replaced by the Word "gnostic"). (b) "Talk to the people in accordance with their intellectual level, not at your own level." a. Example 1: There was a saint who said that he received manifesta lions of Allah seven times a day. Another saint said to him: "If you are a man (i.e., if you dare), go and see Aba Yazld [Bàyazid Bistami] at once." This conversation took place several times. The saint went to the forest, which symbolises Aba Yazids inner State, to see him. Abà Yazld, seeing that the man was coming towards him, left his forest for the saint heading towards him. In spite of this measure that Abâ Yazld took, the saint fell down and died when he saw Allahs light and manifestation in a proportion of Aba Yazids power. Likewise, a clever person when talking to a child, goes out of his jungle to reach out to the child (Sultan Walad, 1350(1931): 17; Kurkcubashi-Zada and Muazzin Kafawl, 1179: 25b). b. Example 2: The oath to the fig and olive trees in the Quran, is in fact, the oath to the Prophet Moses. At the same time, this is an allusion to their place at Allahs side; since they were the trees Moses ate the fruit of. Moses was so revered in Allahs presence that Allah swore to the stations he attained and the soils he trod upon. Their highness and nearness to Allah is on such a level that the mind cannot comprehend. Ail that is said here, is only a drop from V. 4: 3-32). And for very distinctive approach to the Liglit mentioned in Mishkat, see Abdul Karim (2008).</page><page sequence="12">H. Kiiçiikا Asian Journal ofSocial Science 38 (2010) 60-78 71 the sea and a grain from the heap of a grain. In spire of their exalted status, only a small portion is told, in a way accessible to minds and understanding. Talk to the people in accordance with their intellectual level. In fact the portion we said is also too much. Not ail the wise can put up with it; they even lose their hands and legs because of it (Sultan Walad, 1350(1931): 94 95). c. Example 3: Words of the Gods people cannot be comprehended easily. Therefore the Prophet (PBUH) says: "Talk to the people in accordance with their intellectual level." That is, man sould eut out the cloth in accordance with the size of the one who is supposed to wear it. The secrets I tell — either in privare or in public — just suit to your intellectual level (Sultan Walad, 1376: 28). It is worth noting that Sultan Walad concludes his Mâàrif with the words, "Talk to the people in accordance with their intellectual level" (1350(1931): 295). Also, in his other Works, he uses phrases with identical meaning. For instance, on the last page of an Ibtiáá-náma manuscript copied from the original, we see the foilowing notes: قال غر: إذااالختل مص ا؛كلأم ('Ail said: When someones intellect becomes perfectT his speaking diminishes) / إذاا عترالو•، شسكلأإ (When someones intellect becomes perfect, his/her speak ing diminishes), قال.زرمرإذارايت الرحلِكراصدم ئ سنن بجوه (Buzrudj mihr says: When you see someone speaking too much, be sure that he is mad) (see Sultan Walad, 1061: I85b). It will be understood from the above that according to the Mâàrif, it is the intellect which is the most important agent in comprehending the uni verse. There are ten senses in humans; five are outward (:úáhir) and the other five are inward (batin). While seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and touching form the outward senses; common sense (hiss-i mushtarak, called so because it associâtes with outward senses), imagining (khaydl), foreboding (tvahim), memorising (hâfida) and capacity of thinking (mufakkira١ form the inward senses. These ail are put under the command of the intellect/mind (1350(1931): 261 262). A blessed work is the attribute and shadow of the intellect/mind. It is the essential agent (1350(1931): 277), so much so that it should be the intellect which men need to hold in high regard. For instance, from the ancient times onward, people say, "On the death of young people one should cry, not on the death of the old." But this should be the reverse; because the old possessed much more intelligence, learning and maturity than the young (135(1931): 201). In some people, the devil and lower soul/ inner self are dominant, and in others, it is the intellect, which is like Solo mon. This intellect expects obedience and good deeds from man (1350(1931):</page><page sequence="13">72 H. Kiiçûk / Asian Journal ofSocial Science 3tt (2010) 60 78 34-36). Just as Allahs being manifest in the hereafter, thus after libération of man from his animal nature, that is, from deficiency and entering under the intellects dominance (1350(1931): 265). The low, on whom intellects domi nation is weak, are bound to the land; and the high are bound to the sea. Therefore, each is ordered to worship God in accordance with their intellec tuai capacity (1350(1931): 21). (c) "The pen wrote this far, and then it broke!" a. Example 1: For the Quran there exists seven inward levels. How ever, even saints cannot reach beyond the fourth level. This is like a person leaving land for the sea; he can describe the places he saw when he was on land, but how can he describe the way on the sea. The pen wrote this far, and then it brokel The house demolished, its door broken (Sultan Walad, 1350(1931): 227; Kurkcubashi Zada and Muazzin Kafawl, 1179: 46a). b. Example 2: Allah has two kinds of servants: Esteemed ones and a not so esteemed ones. And for instance, the Prophet Muhammads (PBUH) nation will be split into seventy-two nations, and only one group of them will not be in hell.'1؛ As to the Prophet Ibrahim (PBUH), he was one nation "امةواحد؛" (Nahl 16/120), that is, he was equal to one nation. Possibly there are other persons (saints) among people. But we do not tell the hereafter; since the pen wrote this far, and then it broke (Sultán Walad, 1350(1931): 230 239). (d) "There are many secrets hidden under this matter. But it is not allowed to utter them.": a. Example 1: The bodies of people who are already dead before their real death are with people physically and with God with their heart (. ..) There are many secrets hidden under this matter. But it is not allowed to utter them (Sultan Walad, 1350(1931): 207). b. Example 2: The ways to attain God are manyfold. Some saints fare "towards Him", and yet some "in Him." There are many secrets hidden under this matter. But it is not allowed to utter them (Sultan Walad, 1376300 ؛). (e) "The explanation is rather long; if it is told to people, their mind can not comprehend it. filis is beneficia! and sufficient for those who are In fact, the hadith mentions seventy-three, not seventy-two, Islamic fractions, and indi cates that only one will be in paradise. It says also that the Jews and the Christians will be divided into seventy-one or seventy-two fractions (see alTirmidhî, 1992: II, 248). Here it should be kept in mind that there is another version for the hadith which mentions that only one will be in hell, as was the case in the version mentioned above (see al-Maqdisi, 1906: 29).</page><page sequence="14">H. Kiiçûkا Asian Journal ofSocial Science 38 (2010) 60 78 73 guides and cognisant. They can deduce and strive, and eventually derive at what we did not tell (...) The human mind cannot under stand beyond this. So we do not bring further examples": a. Example 1 : Worldly things and everything in this world of form, are only copies of the spiritual realm. Nevertheless, those who do not see this realm cannot talle about them. Just like the Sun, a saint is a pole spreading light (i.e., to see the above-mentioned realm): The explanation is rather long; if it is told to people, their mind cannot comprehend it. This is bénéficiai and sufficient for those who are guides and cognisant. They can deduce and strive, and eventually derive what we did not tell (Sultan Walad, 1350(1931): 227). b. Example 2: A human being is a complex being, one is within the other. He is like a tree, the root of which is in the soil hidden. It lives supported by the soil and water. The rest of the tree comprises the trunk, the leaves, fruits, the core and shadows. The human mind cannot understand beyond this. So we do not bring further examples (Sultan Walad, 1350(1931): 284). (f) "Only those who know understand this" and "There is no end to these words. Into the interprétation and words, nothing other than this can be contained.": ١ a. Example 1: Allah is the light of heaven and earth (اهزورالماو1ت والأرض: al-Nür 24/35). This light is reflected into thousands of bodies. Everything I say is a comparison. Comparison is one thing, and similarity is another.'9 It is impossible to solve it by intellect, knowledge and intellect, like a script which cannot be read before being written. As it is said in a couplet (Sultan Walad, 1350(1931): ممحا،ضىمح. ه حزانيتدّتراأبامحاممحا (You cannot find a thing before you search for it. The Friend (Allah) is exempt: You cannot search for Him before you find Him). For each of these words, there is limitless commentary and uncounted détails. To be able to tell them, you need a lifetime. But the secrets of the words are told for the cognisant (Sultan Walad, .(69 :(1931)1350 1'ر Cfr. with: "Similarity is one thing, comparison is another" (Rùrnî, 1342: 36, 165; Idem, 2000:66, 297). Cfr. this iast sentence with Rùmï, 1342: 189; Idem, 2000: 341.</page><page sequence="15">74 H. Kiiçiik / Asian Journal of Social Science 38 (2010) 60—78 b. Example 2: The devil did not fall prostrate to Adam because he did not see Allahs secrets hidden in him. Only things of the same sort can recognise each other. There is no end to these words. Into interprétation and words, nothing other than this can be contained (Sultan Walad, 1350(1931): 150). It may seem contradictory that in the Intíhá-náma, Sultan Walad emphasises his eagerness to explain 'the divine secrets' to people, when he says: "I would like to utter the secrets explicitly because of the fondness towards this, in my heart. I want them to become known by the people around me, as they are known to me" (1376: 116-117). Sultan Walad says that in íntihá-náma he revealed a great many subtle points, soul-reviving symbols and innumerable secrets, and the work contains these secrets and their commentaries. How ever, this science of heart has no boundaries and it cannot be comprehended even by every gnostic (1376: 295-296). According to him, secrets should not be revealed. Nevertheless, God sent "His Word", i.e., the Quran, so that His orders and prohibitions are known (1376: 235-236). In fact, according to íntihá-náma, there exist three kinds of words: (1) Words told for the wayfarers to make them recover their lower soul; (2) Words told in form of secrets for those who already attained God; and (3) Words beyond letters and sounds. Only people who attained certain sta tion can understand them without hearing any letter or Sound. Instances of the first kind of words are the words of prophets and saints. They are like Noahs ark. He who listens to their advice and agrees them, will get rid of bad flood. Believers who hear these words and try to apply them in the world, will gain happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. This type of sayings certainly should be turned into sounds and words (1376: 261). Examples of the second kind are cliché words repeated by Sultan Walad in his Works: There is no need for much Word for those who understand the mat ter. For the wise a single Word is enough. Since, if there is someone in the vil lage, a letter would be enough. If not, shouting would be wasted (1376: 100). Third kind consists of very spécial kind of words. An instance is Sultán Walads supplément for the story of 'three princes' left unfinished at the end his fathers Mathnawi. Since, in fact, he did not complete the story2' and just said: "It will be told to the inner spirit of those who have the light of the universal soul": ءءة) باءىا،وكدهب بجنان در دل اثكس دارئ نور حان Rûmî, 1377:1251-1253). ل| The full story was first told by Shams of Tabriz in his Makdlàt (see Shams-e Tabrizl, n.d.: 165b-l66a).</page><page sequence="16">H. Kiiçiik / Alian Journal ofSocial Science 38 (2010) 60 78 75 Yet, there are rwo kinds of secrets: (1) The elusive one, and (2) The one beyond any ietter, Word and State. The first kind does not suits everyone; it is for Gods people, and it is their spiritual food. The latter kind of secret can only be heard by people annihilated in God. These secrets will be told their inner soul and help them to elevare a higher station. There, Gods illumina tion will infíltrate in their souls (1376: 28). We can say that although Sultan Walad States in Intihà-nàma that he was not sent to ordinary people, but to the elite (see 758 [26 :ل356أa; 1376: 50) and intended to reveal some divine secrets, he discloses no more than his ordinary words in his Madrif: He only explains that we were united with God before we came into being, or He is the only being, and in the end we will return to Him. That is, a concise narration of Unity of Being. He says, for instance: "I am telling you a secret. Listen carefully: This being is a cur tain (before God). Try to get rid of it immediately" (1376: 132). In Intihd nama, Sultan Walad also uses such clichés as: "No more than this much can be put into the phrases" (1376: 101), "As there is no ear that can be confi dant to these secrets, I restrict myself to this much," (1376: 276-277) "I put words in symbols" (1376: 198)22 as was explained earlier by examples. Using Parables and Metaphors Sultan Walad made use of parables and examples in his MadrifvjYiAc dealing with complex subjects that were not understandable to ordinary people. For instance, while explaining why God sent prophets to people so that they could 'diiferentiate right from wrong', he says: "Allah, may He be exalted, says: I send you to help them to save the white turtledoves from the original black crows, and to gather them around you." Afterwards, he explains: "Thus, the reason I resemble a prophet to the white turtledoves is to make the sub ject understandable. Otherwise, a hundred thousand simurg23 cannot reach his ordinary wing" (1350 (1931): 236). And while saying that knowing Allah, does not mean knowing Himself (Dhdt), but his créatures, he gives the following example: People know each other by their deeds. Allah also can be known by His acts. Like the verse 2هوالذي جعل الشمس صاء واشر ورا وقدر، منازل لتعلموا عدد المتان والخسايا indicates: "هوالذي (He it is): This is an allusion and means that Allah, may 12 For more examples, see fCiiçtik (forthcoming). تل Simurg means 'thirty birds'. Here, it is an allusion to Sitnurg in Farid al-Dïn Attars (d. 587/1191) Mantik aitayr. " "He it is Who appointed the Sun a splendour and the moon a light, and measured for her stages, that ye might know the number of the years, and the reckoning" (al-Kor an, Yunus 10/5).</page><page sequence="17">76 H. Kûçiik / Asian Journal ofSocial Science 38 (2010) 60—78 He be exalted, says: I am very much explicit and evident. Just as, you see some peoples outlook and shape, but do not know their features, art and knowledge. And yet there are others you know by their words and deeds; therefore you say that you know and understand someone very well, since you had many conversations with him and accompanied him for years. But now you did not see his shape for years. What you saw in those years, was his essence/spirit, not his shape. Since his spirit cannot be seen by looking care fully. You can see only his deeds and hear his words.هو الذي: you are some one or you are not someone that these kinds of Works and words occurred from you. Now, o someone, you see some people this way and for some oth ers you are not able to see this way. Now I am your God; it is necessary that you see me this way" (Sultan Walad, 1350(1931): 224; Kurkcubashi-Zada and Muazzin Kafawl, 1179: 43b44a). Sultan Walad makes Allah talk like a human in order to be much more understandable. For instance, he makes Allah reprimand the infidels who are opposing his sending humamprophets like this: "O insolent dogs! This is an imper tinence and insolence that can send you deep into hell (!اىسكانك1اضاعنر كناحى وحراتتَمم سمارا در درك، يوبخ حاهد ساند)" (Sultan Walad, 1350(1931): 128) ■What matters to him, is clarity and understanding and if this anthropomorphism or not, it does not matter to him. He is of the opin ion that, unless issues are clear and understandable, it is better to keep silent. Conclusion Sultan Walad was a Sufi extremely attached to ceremonies and rituals. His appointment of substitutes who taught his fathers teaching to the people, was a sign of this type of character. Being a man of self-possession and rea son, and behaving in accordance with the conditions of the time, he organised Mawlawism. It is no secret that, while some Sufis tell people of their visions and Gods manifestations, i.e., theosophical issues, and so cause misunderstanding and confusion, others use metaphors and allusions so as not to expose their visions and Gods manifestations to non-eligible people. Sultan Walad prefers 'keeping silence' or uttering few words when talking about these kind of matters. He always preserved his self-possession during his sermons and, when it came to obscure theosophical détails, used such the clichés as : lf there is someone in the village, a sound/letter would be enough. If not, shouting would be wasted", "For the wise, a sign is sufficient," "There are many secrets hidden under this matter. But it is not allowed to utter them," "The pen wrote this far, and then it broke!" etc.</page><page sequence="18">H. Kiiçiik / Asian Journal of Social Science 38 (2010) 60-78 77 These examples clearly show the importance that Sultan Walad attached to a didactic approach, as well as his ability and achievements, in shaping Mawlawiam into an Order informed by populism and his theosophical understanding of Sufism.
