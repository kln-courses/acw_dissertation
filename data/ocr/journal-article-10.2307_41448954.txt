This exciting book shows ethology solidifying its correlations between patterned acts and the social and individual meaning of this behavior with careful avoidance of anthropomorphic interpretation. The most dramatic and insightful of the contributions, Chapter 9 by Jane van Lawick-Goodall, usefully overlooks this tabu in characterizing individual behavior contrast of chimpanzee mothers in relation to infants and rival siblings. But as in R. A. Hinde and Y. Spencer-Booth's macaque</page><page sequence="2">138 BOOK REVIEWS mother-infant study, there are careful statistical charts on age-change in suckling time, suckling frequency, support by mother, play time, grooming by mother or by infant. There are six tables, including summary of infant achievement thresholds (N = 4) and the only existing directly observed data on a wild primate infant death rate (35% of all births). Particularly interesting are the data on copulation, sex cycles and pregnancy, birth reactions and tactile and auditory signals leading toward speech. Communication between chimpanzees gains importance because there is no distinct band organization and the mother thus becomes a focal point for her offspring of various ages with particularly long dependence, little rebuke or punishment and no sharp break at the time of weaning. Hinde and Spencer-Booth put more stress on " aunt " rivalry in a captive family setup of rhesus monkeys, with clarifying diagrams to contrast isolated versus group-reared infants and both expected conclusions (group-reared learn social signals earlier) and unexpected results (some coordinate movements were later in isolate infants). Quite logically the book begins with van HoofFs functional classifi- cation of 13 facial displays with the social circumstances involved, the usual vocalizations, and apparent message where deduction is possible; the amazing point is that van Hoof identifies these throughout the whole range of Old World monkeys and apes. W. Wickler (Chapter 3) goes to the ano-genital area, brilliantly colored in many Old World primates, to identify signal displays - not only the familiar presentation by oestrous females (or by inferiors to superiors) but also penis displays which Wickler traces from urine-marking of territory in lemurs (as in many mammals) and traces to phallic and boundary-stones in many human societies. His analysis of parallel sex signals in human groups is stimulating, though I don't understand why he omits the breasts (as stated on p. 128) which have at least as much signal value as buttocks and also omits reference to the work of Schilder on body image in man. Signal behavior in New World primates, reported by Moynihan (Chapter 7), contrasts strikingly, perhaps because the animals are small and are communicating more often in trees and over relatively bigger spaces: facial and laryngeal evolution differ in detail; there are many whole-body signals, but not ano-genital ones, and vocalizing is best developed in the large animals who are in least danger from predators. Sparks (Chapter 4) describes the details of allogrooming in all pri- mate groups, noting its greater frequency and institutionalized stability in Old World monkeys and apes as compared with New World monkeys,</page><page sequence="3">BOOK BEVIEWS 139 its great significance in social interactions relating aggression to status, and its attenuation in man; his suggestion that evolution of dextrous thumbs started from grooming (p. 156) will provoke more response from anthropologists than his implication that grooming evolved from parental care of skin and fur (p. 149) : Primates show neotenous features at many levels. Loizos' review (Chapter 5) of play behavior shows its presumed value as a sharpener for the motor activities needed for fighting or mating, for example, with special facial expressions to show the recipient that the action is not "real," but she is careful to point out (p. 185) that its evolutionary necessity is not yet proved fully. She relates it to arousal (e.g. reticular formation), to adequate maternal stimulation of infants, and to Morris' stress (p. 188) on the curiosity (neophilia) built into primate CNS with its implication of potential creativity. This type of communication interlocks with the chapters on maternal behavior, and with ÃŸo well's (Chapter 6) sketch of the range of different social organizations, depending strongly on food, ecology including terri- tory size, and crowding. Finally, Blurton- Jones analyzes human nursery school behavior by action patterns, most usefully with regard to descrip- tion of pattern (e. g. the play face, the fleeing face, or rage action analogous to van Hooff's pictures) and with some interesting corre- lations - e.g. laughter with running; he comments on the importance of future longitudinal study in order to check such speculation as a basic divide between action people and word people. Desmond Morris' six-page introduction unifies the book more essen- tially than accidentally by giving a history of ethology with its stress on isolation of action patterns (" ethograms ") and avoidance of humanizing. It is really a blend of Aristotelian and experimental approaches, avoiding the narrowness of the latter and the philosophizing of the former. Morris is to be congratulated as much on his choice of authors, with their vigorous, iconoclastic yet restrained attacks, as on his own tone for the book. Inconsistencies occur. Is it Papio anubis (p. 221) or ursinus (p. 153) ? Supposedly DeVore (quoted) was study- ing cynocephalus at Amboseli. Can baboons really reach forty years (p. 223) ? Bramblett estimates fifteen years as the life span in the wild. There are other difficulties in equating wild and caged situations rather differently balanced by each author. These inconsistencies do not detract from the book's importance, however. J. Lawrence Angel Division of Physical Anthropology, Smithsonian Institution Washington, D. O. 20560</page></plain_text>
