<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ideas / Idées Twenty-five Years Later: The Questions Andrew Lyons Wilfrid Laurier University In ciated, the history or ought of to anthropology, be associated, certain with the years appearance are asso- ciated, or ought to be associated, with the appearance of books that made a difference to the discipline, for example 1922 (Malinowski's Argonauts ), 1928 ( Mead's Coming of Age in Samoa), 1949 (Lévi-Strauss's Les structures élémentaires de la parenté ), 1968 (Harris's The Rise of Anthropological Theory ). In similar fashion, 1986 was the year of Writing Culture (Clifford and Mar- cus 1986) and Anthropology as Cultural Critique (Mar- cus and Fischer 1986), the year that something we called "postmodernism" (a term as elastic as the existentialism of a previous decade) took centre stage. Arguably for the first time, the selection of field sites, the process of field- work (and the power relations intrinsic to it) and the rhet- oric of ethnography became the focus of theoretical talk rather than diachronic processes such as evolution and supposed synchronic structures. Key notions such as cul- ture and the field (particularly after Gupta and Fergu- son's Anthropological Locations in 1997) were bracketed and questioned. Polyvocality-polyphony replaced un- abashed ethnographic authority as a desideratum. There were experiments with ethnographic form, merging ethnography as a fictive form with "pure" fiction. The new orthodoxy (that was not) declared the comparative method dead along with instrumental reason and scien- tific pretence. One is perfectly aware that there never was a united "postmodernist" movement in anthropol- ogy, that there were Foucauldians, Derrideans, devotees of the Frankfurt School, pragmatiste, practitioners of the anthropology of experience, students of Turner and Geertz, some of the above, all of the above and none of the above. Those who rejected "the posts" included latter-day Boasians, structural-functionalists, many psychological and cognitive anthropologists, neo-Marxists who prac- tised anthropological political economy, symbolic and structural anthropologists, cultural materialists, cultural ecologists and sociobiologists. In other words, this diverse Anthropologica 53 (2011) 305-334 Ideas /Idées / 305</page><page sequence="2">group shared little in common, except that they all clung to some vision of anthropology as a comparative science, albeit only the cultural materialists and some cognitive anthropologists were diehard positiviste. Among the crit- ics of the movement numbered Marvin Harris (1998) for every reason one could imagine, many followers of Eric Wolf, Roy ď Andrade (1995) who was particularly upset by the postmodernism of Nancy Scheper-Hughes, Her- bert Lewis (1998) who felt that the gains of the Boasian movement (such as the scientific dismissal of racism) were in danger of obloquy at the hands of a movement that seemed (to him) intent on misrepresenting anthropology's past, Marshall Sahlins (the first major anthropologist to utilize the work of Baudrillard) who has criticized inap- propriate extensions of Foucauldian notions beyond the specific context of early modernity which they were used to describe (Sahlins 2002), and Tom Beidelman who stated that the doubting of ethnographic authority was "a failure of moral nerve" (1986:10). After 25 years one must ask how lasting the effect of postmodernism has been? Were its proponents or its critics right? To what extent has it been absorbed into the mainstream, whatever that main- stream may be? Is there a new empiricism, more con- cerned with the actual circumstances of globalization, global flows and world crises than with any grand theory or grand anti-theory? Indeed, is there any sign of a new theoretical movement that will create the same stir as Writing Culture or, from a different perspective, 1968's Rise of Anthropological TheoryX ' There is another set of questions that Canadians might ask. Only one Canadian (something few noticed?) and only one woman (something many rightly remarked) contributed to Writing Culture - Mary Louise Pratt from Listowel, Ontario, who is not an anthropologist stricto sensu. Those who recall meetings from that time know that English-speaking Canadians, such as Michael Lam- bek (1991), Stanley Barrett (1996: 150-163) and Regna .Darnell were very much involved in these debates. In Québec, there was a more muted reaction - perhaps here we could talk of two (anthropological) solitudes. We invited a number of scholars to contribute mini- articles or short commentaries on the theme "25 Years Later," which might or might not react to the thoughts outlined above, but would address the fortune of post- modernism in anthropology. The responses we got could not have been more diverse. We received two short articles. Michael Fischer offers us a polyphonic, nine-canto Singspiel , a whimsical, imaginary reprise of the Santa Fe conference that led to the publication of Writing Culture with a dramatis per- sona e that seems to bear some kind of resemblance to the original cast. Like most humour, the Singspiel has a seri- ous purpose: to fend off what Fischer perceives to be "mis- readings, misapprehensions, misappropriations" of the book in the years immediately following its publication. The Singspiel is preceded by an introduction, and the piece discusses some more recent works by the author and some other participants in the conference. Michael Lambek undertook to revise and reshape an unpublished essay for this volume, evaluating three approaches to anthropological inquiry, based to some degree on Alas- dair Maclntyre's "Three Rival versions of Moral Inquiry" (1990). These are Encyclopaedia (objectivist), Genealogy (sceptical) and Tradition (hermeneutical). Very obviously, anthropological postmodernism epitomized by some essays in Writing Culture emphasizes Genealogy over Tradition and tends to eschew Encyclopaedia. Despite his own hermeneutic bent, Lambek sees the anthropology of the future as based on an interplay between these three approaches which, unlike Maclntyre, he does not view as mutually exclusive. There are four commentaries. Stanley Barrett ap- proves of the turn to reflexivity and understands that the crisis of representation was a necessary consequence of the end of colonialism, the Vietnam War, globalization and new forms of mass communication. However, he consid- ers the "experimental moment" a failure, because, in his view, little of value has emerged from "either dialogical texts or mixed genres." In Barrett's view, a renascent empiricism, based in good ethnography, could reinvigo- rate anthropology. However, Regna Darnell, who has been a referee, for several Turner prizes, considers that the movement toward experimental ethnography, which is postmodernism^ legacy, has not been a failure. Our bricoleur's "toolkit has been substantially expanded by postmodernism." Andrew Strathern and Pamela Stewart believe that, despite a tendency sometimes to produce pretentious, solipsistic critiques, postmodernism brought a moment of healthy scepticism to the theory and practice of anthropology. The movement "from Saussure to not so sure" was beneficial. Finally, Alan Smart, who was never a postmodernist, observes that anthropological post- modernism was and is in spirit a humanistic movement inspired by eclectic traditions like postmodernist archi- tecture and that it does not preach the "death of the sub- ject" like so many forms of post-structuralism. However, it is his view that the anthropology of the future will be "post-human." It must transcend the anthropomorphism that predominates in most theory and ethnography and break down the barriers between humans and their envi- ronment, some part of which we have fashioned into a pros- thetic extension of ourselves, and particularly between 306 / Ideas /Idées Anthropologica 53 (201 1)</page><page sequence="3">1 .
