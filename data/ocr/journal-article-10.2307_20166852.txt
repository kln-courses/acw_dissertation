<plain_text><page sequence="1">Idolatry and representation MOSHE HALBERTAL and AVISHAI MARGALIT The prohibitions against idolatry are an attempt to dictate the ways in which God may be represented. It is forbidden not only to worship other gods such as Ba'al but also to represent God himself by means of a statue or picture. This aspect ofthe ban on idolatry raises many questions: What are the proper methods of representing God, and which methods are forbidden? Why are representations in pictures and statues forbidden, and why are linguistic representations permitted? What are representations of God by idols supposed to mean? Are they an attempt to represent him by means of something that resembles him, and thus forbidden because there is nothing that resembles God? Or can they be regarded as representations in which there is a special presence ofthe gods, thus narrowing the gap between the world and God to a greater degree than can be tolerated by the monotheistic religions? According to the view that distinguishes the ban on the worship of other gods from the making of images and likenesses of the God of Israel, the two consecutive verses in the Ten Commandments, "You shall have no other gods besides Me" and "You shall not make for yourself a sculptured image or any likeness" (Exodus 20:3-4), must be understood as two separate prohibitions. The second verse, in other words, must be understood as a second prohibition: it is forbidden to worship other gods, and in addition it is forbidden to make images and likenesses of God himself.1 Such an understanding ofthe prohibition seems explicitly called for in Deuteronomy: "Be most careful?since you saw no shape when the Lord your God spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire?not to act wickedly and make for yourselves a sculptured image in any likeness whatever: the form of a man or woman" (4:15-16). Since the Israelites did not see any image on Mount Sinai, they are forbidden to make images or pictures?a clear expression of the fear of the representation of God himself in images and pictures. In the same chapter in Deuteronomy, the revelation at Sinai is described as hearing the voice of God without seeing any shape: "You heard the sound of words but perceived no shape?nothing but a voice" (4:12). This emphasis, which is repeated several times in the chapter, is intended to eliminate the possibility that the very revelation that forbade the making of images and pictures would be conceived as a revelation in which a shape of God was seen, and so would be a cause of the making of images and pictures.2 But the chapter does not tell us why a linguistic description of God's hand is permitted while a drawing of his hand is forbidden. At first glance it would seem that gods can be represented by any one of three types of representation. There are similarity-based representations such as sculptures and pictures, m?tonymie representations such as the Ark of the Covenant and the cherubim, and conventional representations such as linguistic descriptions of a god. The different relations between the types of representation and the prohibitions on representations are the subject of this essay. Similarity-based representations Idols, the error of substitution, and fetishes The prophets describe idol worship as the worship of wood and stone. When the idolater bows down to the idol, according to Isaiah, he worships the image itself and not what the image represents. In their polemics the prophets taunt the idol worshipers with the idiocy of worshiping wood and stone; the ?mage is not a sign or symbol of god, the prophets flatly state, it is god.3 This view of the function of the ?mage as a fetish was clearly influenced by the biblical polemics that attempted to portray the idolaters as identifying their god with wood and stone.4 The other extreme in describing the function Excerpted and adapted from Idolatry, by Moshe Halbertal and Avishai Margalit, copyright ?

In Exodus we find the verse, "The Lord came down upon Mount Sinai" (19:20), while in Deuteronomy the following is written: "From the heavens He let you hear His voice to discipline you; on earth He let you see His great fire; and from amidst that fire you heard His words" (4:36).

The biblical reduction of paganism to mere fetishism can be understood as an intentional misrepresentation for the sake of polemics. Y. Kaufman explains that the Bible never confronts pagan myths or other conceptions of the pagan gods aside from the fetishistic elements, not as a result of intentional ridicule of paganism but as a sign that the pagan religions were not truly understood. According to Kaufman the "monotheistic revolution" in Israel was successful to the extent that the</page><page sequence="2">20 RES 22 AUTUMN 1992 of images and their place in worship is the view that images and icons are mere signs, with no unique powers, capable of serving only as reminders and transparent representations ofthe gods. Icons, according to this view, inspire and teach; they are mainly didactic artifacts and not active forces. Such attitudes were expressed by those who defended icons in the church during the iconoclastic debate ofthe seventh century and by Catholics in arguing against the Reformation in the sixteenth century.5 These two extreme views, of course, must be distinguished from the more complex views of the worshipers themselves. Between the two extremes is a variety of attitudes regarding the relationship ofthe gods to their icons. Those attitudes, free from either polemics or apologetics, describe and reflect more faithfully the role of icons as representations. Not mere transparent signs, icons have independent power; they heal and perform miracles and therefore are addressed and worshiped. Their unique power is due not to the identity between God and the material makeup of the icon but to the special relationship between the two. The relationship is only partly based on the similarity between the symbol and the thing symbolized. The icon also shares some ofthe features ofthe thing it represents. This special relationship is described in a variety of forms. The idol is one of the manifestations ofthe god?sometimes his place of residence (like the soul in the body) and sometimes a direct concentration of his powers. Moreover, in certain ritual contexts there are special causal connections between the god and its icons. By means of these causal connections an act performed on the icon becomes an act upon the god itself.6 In the Bible itself there is a similar attitude to the holy vessels. The presence of the Ark of the Covenant could bring life and death: it brought disaster upon the Philistines and killed thousands of Israel's people in Beth Shemesh.7 Thus there is a "substitution" in idol worship of the symbol for the thing symbolized, in which some of the traits of the symbolized thing are transferred to the symbolizing thing. In this substitution the two prohibitions?the one against the making of sculptures and pictures and the one against the worship of other gods?are actually joined. The prohibition against making sculptures and pictures is explained by the potential for them to be eventually transformed from representations of god or other gods to other gods themselves. Thus the prohibition against the ?con in this conception has two components. First, the gap between the god and the world is blurred by the representation that possesses the features of the god itself. Second, this creates a very deep fear of substitution, in which the idol takes the place of the god in the eyes of the worshiper. The nonpagans' great fear of similarity-based representation is the possibility of a substitutive error, in which the idol ceases to be the representation or symbol of God and comes to be seen as God himself or part of him. In such a case, the idol is regarded as a fetish that slowly and gradually acquires the traits ofthe thing it is representing. In a certain sense it becomes the body ofthe god, the residence of its soul, and an independent object of ritual worship. The purpose ofthe prohibitions dictating proper methods of representation is to prevent errors of substitution of the representations for God. The understanding of idolatry as an error of substitution was central to Maimonides' thought. The transition from belief in a first cause, which Maimonides considered a chronologically prior belief, to the worship Bible recognized only marginal pagan practices and nothing more. See Y.

It is interesting to examine the Philistines' reactions to the ark when it was brought by Israel to the war against them. The Philistines first identify the ark with Israel's God: "When they learned that the Ark of the Lord had come into the camp, the Philistines were frightened; for they said, 'God has come to the camp'" (I Samuel 4:6). Israel on the other hand regarded the ark as a representation of God because it is God's footstool and throne, and God is called Lord of Hosts Enthroned on the Cherubim. On this difference see J. Milgrom, TheJPS Torah Commentary: Numbers (Philadelphia and New York: Jewish Publication Society, 1990), pp. 373-375.</page><page sequence="3">Halbertal and Margal it: Idolatry and representation 21 of idols did not occur in one direct leap. Rather, it took place through intermediate stages in which the worshiped heavenly forces and their images first served as intermediaries between the worshiper and God and only subsequently became gods. Maimonides describes this development at the beginning of the section on the laws relating to idolatry in his Code of Jewish Law. Initially, worshipers thought that worshiping the intermediaries was a way of showing respect for God, just as honoring the servants of a king is a way of showing respect for the king. This view led the people to begin worshiping the moon and the stars, but still as intermediaries?"They did not say that there was no god but this star." Afterward false prophets arose who said that God had commanded them to worship a certain star or all the stars, and so they built temples and filled them with idols representing the stars. The gap between God himself and worship of him was increased further by the claim that God had commanded not only that the stars, which were intermediaries, should be worshiped but also that the images of the stars, which were intermediaries upon intermediaries, should be worshiped. The motivation for worshiping these intermediaries was supported by the assertion that they were capable of causing good and evil events to occur, and that success was dependent on worshiping them. In the next stage, there were more false prophets who claimed that these stars had commanded that they should be worshiped, that is, these intermediaries were given the additional status of being able to give commands and prophecies. The end of this process, as described by Maimonides, was as follows: And as the days progressed the name of the revered and awesome God was forgotten from the entire universe and no one knew of Him. Thus all the ordinary folk, including women and children, did not know of anything but the images of wood and stone and the stone temples, as they had been taught from childhood to bow down to them and to worship them and to swear by them. The wise men among them, such as the priests and others, pretended that there was no God but the stars and the constellations in whose form the images were made. But there was not one who knew the Rock of Ages. (Laws of Idolatry 1:2) At the end of the process, according to Maimonides, there was a fetishistic folk religion, and the masses forgot that the idols in the temples were representations of the stars and not independent forces. One of the most important components in the process ofthe transformation ofthe representation into an independent power was the use of representations of the representations. The religious elite was aware that the idols were only representations of heavenly forces, but even the priests and the wise men made the substitutive error of regarding the heavenly forces themselves as gods rather than as intermediaries for the Rock of Ages. The only difference between the masses and the priests was that the latter made the substitutive error in a later stage and attributed less transparency to the intermediaries as representations. The masses erred at the stage of the idols themselves, in relating to them as if they were fetishes, although they were only representations ofthe heavenly forces. The priests erred in their fetishistic attitude toward the heavenly forces, although these were only representations of God. Since it is the error of substitution that is the cause of idolatry, according to Maimonides the purpose ofthe prohibitions against idolatry is to ensure that such errors will not be made. This is the reason that the worship of created beings and symbols was forbidden, even if the worshipers were aware that they were only being worshiped as intermediaries.8 Whatever historical validity Maimonides' description may have, what interests us in his description is the analysis of the error of substitution. According to Maimonides, the cause of the error of substitution is the act of worship, as beliefs follow actions. The confusion results from the fact that in a situation of representation only the ways of relating are supposed to be transferred, and not the predicates applying to the represented thing. The king's representative is not the king himself, although some of the ways of relating to the king are transferred to the representative because of his role. The error of substitution occurs in the next stage, when the thing 8. There is a similar description in Maimonides, The Guide ofthe Perplexed, trans. S. Pines (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1963), 1:36. The attribution of powers to sacred objects that represent God is widespread within the nonpagan religions themselves. In certain kabbalistic traditions the prohibition against erasing even a single letter in the Torah scroll is interpreted as a prohibition against erasing God himself. The extreme caution involved in the laws for writing a Torah scroll thus derives from the fact that the obligation to write the scroll is connected with the act of multiplying the presence of God in the world through the Torah scrolls. For conceptions of such immanent representations ofthe divinity in Kabbalah, see M. Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1988), pp. 188-189. One of the manuscripts Idel cites says that someone who writes a Torah scroll is making God. In contrast to such views we can cite the attitude of Maimonides toward those who turn the mezuzah into a good-luck charm by adding holy names on its parchment: "It is not enough for these fools that they have voided the fulfillment of the commandment [adding the names makes the parchment unfit as a mezuzah], but they have also taken a great commandment which is the unification of the name of God and His worship, and used it as if it were a good-luck charm for their own benefit" (Maimonides, Code of Jewish Law, Laws of Mezuzah, 5:4).</page><page sequence="4">22 RES 22 AUTUMN 1992 represented is described as if it were the thing it represents. This is what occurs with respect to the heavenly forces and the idols. Substitution occurs again when the attitudes that were derived from the fact that the object is a representation continue to exist even after the object is no longer perceived as such. The attitude of respect and worship toward the heavenly powers was derived from their being representations of God, but this attitude persisted even after they were no longer perceived in this way. In Maimonides' view the purpose of the prohibitions against idolatry was to ensure that the worship of God would be free of the possibility of the substitutive error. Here we see an absolute shift to the worship of one God, which is the crucial meaning of the prohibition on idolatry. Erroneous representation or inappropriate representation? There is another problem with similarity-based representation even where there is no fear of substitution. In the painting on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in which Michelangelo painted God creating Adam, there is no problem of substitution. No one has ever claimed that God is present in this painting or confused the painting with God. Those who interpret the prohibition against images most strictly will oppose this painting, however, because there is something forbidden in the very act of representing God in a painting. The prohibition against representing God in a sculpture or painting is the prohibition against a representation that seems to be based on similarity. Why is it forbidden to represent God in this way? If it is assumed that God has no image, then any similarity-based representation of God must necessarily be a wrong representation, a diminution of what he really is. The error is in the very act of making an image of something that has no image.9 Representation is prohibited as a result ofthe metaphysical claim that since God has no image, any representation of God, and naturally any worship of such a representation constitutes the worship of a false god. The problem in this case is that any similarity-based representation is mistaken and causes an error in the conception of God for anyone who sees or worships such a representation. Although the claim that God has no image is considered by Maimonides as a principle of faith, it is not so clear that it is accepted in the Bible or in the rabbinic traditions. In the Bible it seems that God does indeed have an image, except that to represent this image in any way is forbidden. Thus, for example, when Moses asks to see God's face, God answers, "You cannot see My face, for man may not see Me and live" (Exodus 33:20). Elsewhere it is said of Moses that "he beholds the likeness of the Lord" (Numbers 12:8), and of the elders of Israel that "they beheld God, and they ate and drank" (Exodus 24:11). Isaiah saw the Lord "seated on a high and lofty throne" (Isaiah 6:1), and Ezekiel describes him as having "the semblance of a human form" (Ezekiel 1:26). It thus seems that the prohibition against representation is associated not with the metaphysical question of whether God has an image but with the methods of representing God in ritual worship. The Bible itself does not resolve the question of whether God has an image. Moshe Weinfeld claims that biblical literature does ascribe an image to God, for example, when the priestly source speaks of God as dwelling within the sanctuary. At the same time, according to Weinfeld, in Deuteronomy there is a more abstract concept of God as having no image. In Deuteronomy God's dwelling in the sanctuary is replaced by his name's dwelling there.10 It is not clear in Deuteronomy how one should interpret the verse "since you saw no shape when the Lord your God spoke to you" (4:15): is this a negation of the existence of a shape of God or only a stipulation that the Israelites did not see any such shape? At any rate it seems that there is a view embedded in the Bible that ascribes a shape to God, and the issue is whether there is any tension within the Bible concerning this question. These trends within the Bible are developed further in the Shi'ur Komah literature, a form of mystical literature from the second and third centuries that discusses the size of the parts of God's body. This literature is filled with visual descriptions of God and describes experiences of seeing him directly. It is entirely possible that this tradition is not a mystic tradition on the edge of the mainstream Judaism but is found within the very heart of rabbinic Judaism, as Saul Lieberman claims. He points out that the midrash on the Song of Songs tells us about traditions of God being seen?at the crossing of the Red Sea and at the giving of the Torah; the midrash about the song at the 9. Two arguments may be found in the iconoclastic literature ofthe sixteenth century. One is that the worship of statues is a substitute for the worship of God; the other is that the statues are not capable of representing the deity properly because the infinite and the spiritual cannot be given material representation. The material representation of God would lead to the conception that he is a material being. This claim is repeated many times by Calvin and others; see Eire, War against the Idols, p. 201. 10. See M. Weinfeld, Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomistic School (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972), pp. 191-209.</page><page sequence="5">Halbertal and Margal it: Idolatry and representation 23 crossing of the Red Sea tells us specifically that the Israelites saw God at the sea when they said, "This is my God and I will enshrine Him" (Exodus 15:2). The claim that God has no image, which was turned into one of the foundations of Judaism by Maimonides, does not reflect either the Bible or the rabbinic tradition. It would therefore be very difficult to say that the prohibition against idols and pictures was based on this claim.11 In keeping with this approach, we argue that the difference between the worship of God and the worship of idols is not in the issue of whether the divinity has an image but rather in the issue of whether it is permitted to make a representation of this image. The important question is thus the following one: if God actually does have an image, why is it forbidden to make a similarity based representation of this image? One answer is that God does indeed have an image, but no person has seen it, and so there is a danger that any representation will be incorrect. From this argument it would follow that if someone should happen by some chance to see God's ?mage he or she would be permitted to make a representation of it. A possible rejoinder to this is that even someone who had seen God's image would be forbidden to make a representation of it, because every representation constitutes a diminution of respect for the represented object. God would lose his uniqueness in the process of representation and in the fact of having many imitations, and his value would decline, just as the value of a work of art declines when there are many reproductions of it. The sense of the gap between God and his worshipers is based on the fact that they can never see his image, even in a representation. This may be compared to the kings of Persia, who would speak to their subjects from behind a screen and were never seen.12 In general, there are two opposite approaches to the task of creating a feeling of remoteness and authority: one is to distribute pictures of the king everywhere, and the other is to prevent anyone from ever seeing the king. The prohibition against making images and pictures is a facet ofthe second approach, which is based on mystery and distance. This prohibition is independent ofthe metaphysical view that God has no image and relates only to the issue of the permitted methods of representation. The problem here is not one of the error in representation but of the degree of exposure of what is being represented on the basis of similarity, where this exposure is independent of the problem ofthe substitutive error. The representation is not mistaken, it is inappropriate. The distinction between the idol worshipers and their opponents is not in the image of God in the minds of the worshipers but in the methods of representing him in ritual worship. In the view of Maimonides, however, the image of God in the mind of the worshiper is the crucial element. He, therefore, insists that those who ascribe a corporeal image to God are heretics and will have no share in the world-to-come. Rabad, in his commentary on Maimonides' Code of Jewish Law (Laws of Repentance 3:7), disagrees with Maimonides and returns the focus of the discussion from what is in the worshiper's head to what is represented in the act of worship.13 Metonymie representations The biblical tradition, which so clearly forbids similarity-based representations of God, permits m?tonymie representations of him. Even in the Jewish temple, when one passes from the courtyard to the outer part of the temple building, and from the outer part to the inner part, the Holy of Holies behind the curtain, one does not see any image of God, as is the custom in pagan 11. See S. Lieberman, "Mishnat Shir ha-Shirim," a Hebrew appendix to G. Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and Talmudic Tradition (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary, 1965). For a discussion ofthe Shi'ur Komah literature, see Scholem, On the Mystical Shape ofthe Godhead: Basic Concepts in the Kabbalah, trans. J. Neugroschel (New York: Schocken, 1991), pp. 15-55. On notions of the image of God, see Idel, Kabbalah, pp. 119-136 and n. 14. Traditions of seeing God directly exist therefore in the Bible, early Jewish mystical literature, and the midrash. In one ofthe earliest midrash?m, the Torat Kohanim, sec. 1, chap. 2, pt. 2, we find: "R. Dosa said: God said, 'No man may see Me and live?they cannot see Me when they are alive but they can do so after their death.'" Also see Sifrei on Numbers, sec. 103. 12. The Sassian monarch sat on a throne with a veiled face or behind a curtain. He was therefore inaccessible and unseen. On this practice, see G. Windengren, "The Sacral Kingship in Iran," in The Sacral Kingship (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1959), p. 247. 13. R. Abraham ben David differs with Maimonides' opinion in the Code of Jewish Law, Laws of Repentance, 3:7: "Three types of people are called heretics: one who says that there is no deity and the world has no ruler, one who says there is a ruler but there are two or more, one who says that there is one sovereign but he is a body and has an image." R. Abraham ben David comments as follows: "Even though this is a principle of our faith, one who believes that He is a body due to his understanding ofthe language ofthe biblical verses and the Midrash according to their literal meaning is not worthy of being called a heretic." There are other versions of this criticism that are expressed much more sharply; e.g., "Many who are better than he [Maimonides] believe in the corporeality of God." For a detailed analysis ofthe controversy, see I. Twersky, Rabadof Posquieres (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1962), pp. 282-286. On the controversy that evolved around the Maimonidean denial of anthropomorphism and the opposition that supported anthropomorphic views, see B. Septimus, Hispano-Jewish Culture in Transition (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1982), pp. 75-103.</page><page sequence="6">24 RES 22 AUTUMN 1992 temples. There is an expectation of seeing God, or at least an image of him, behind the curtain, but the only things to be seen there are the cherubim. The cherubim do not represent God by resembling him; rather, they are a m?tonymie representation of God: they represent God because they are directly associated with him, being his chariot. (We do not believe that the cherubim are similarity-based representations of m?tonymie representations, that is, that the cherubim in the temple are representations that resemble the heavenly chariot; in our opinion the cherubim themselves are the chariot.)14 Metonymie representations are permitted because they do not lead to error in the conception of God, as they do not represent him by being similar to him. Moreover, God is not revealed in a m?tonymie representation to the degree that he is in one based on similarity. An ?mage of God is not the same as his chariot, if the intention is to prevent direct exposure of the image of God himself. The fact that m?tonymie representations of God are permitted supports our contention that the basis for the prohibition against images and pictures is not the fear of substitution but the struggle against mistaken or inappropriate representations. Substitution can occur just as easily in m?tonymie as in similarity-based representations. Didn't the Israelites treat the Ark of the Covenant as a fetish when they took it to the war with the Philistines on the assumption that it would grant them victory? If the primary fear was a fear of the substitution of the representation for the represented thing, then m?tonymie representations should have been forbidden as well. Often the accusation of idolatry is hurled at some person or group because the accuser has failed to distinguish between m?tonymie and similarity-based representations. Thus, for example, some scholars claim that equating worship of the golden calves in the northern kingdom of Israel with idol worship is a mistake.15 The worshipers ofthe golden calves, according to this claim, did not worship them as similarity-based representations of God but as a substitute for the cherubim and the Ark of the Covenant, which were in Jerusalem. (There are those who explain the sin of worshiping the golden calf in the desert in the same way.) To consider worship of the golden calves in the northern kingdom idolatry is to attribute similarity-based representation to what is only m?tonymie representation.16 This very same process may be applied in reverse to permit what seems to be idolatry, or what seems mistaken from a theological viewpoint, and to make it legitimate. That is, similarity-based representations may be transformed into m?tonymie ones in order to solve serious problems. For example, when the translator-commentator Onkelos encounters biblical verses describing God as appearing in a cloud or in a fire, he transforms them into manifestations of objects that God created for the purpose of revelation, instead of seeing them as manifestations of God himself or of something resembling him.17 There is indeed a direct causal relation between God and the cloud, but it is not a relation of similarity. The process of transforming the similarity-based representation into a m?tonymie one thus legitimizes the representation. Conventional representations Although the biblical tradition regards the making of sculptured images and pictures as a grave sin, it permits 14. On the nature ofthe cherubim and the ark as God's throne and therefore as his representations, see M. Haran, "The Ark and the Cherubim: Their Symbolic Significance in Biblical Ritual," Israel Exploration Journal 9 (1959): 39-48, 89-94. 15. Views that the northern golden calves functioned like the ark in Jerusalem are discussed in M. Aberbach and L. Smolar, "Aaron Jerobam and the Golden Calves," Journal of Biblical Literature 86 (1900): 135 and n. 34. 16. The prohibition against making m?tonymie representations may be found in Mekhilta, commentary on the verse: "You shall not make for yourselves any gods of silver or any gods of gold" (Exodus 20:20). Concerning the extension of this prohibition to pictures and sculptures of human form or the constellations even in nonritualistic context, see the Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Rosh Hashanah 24a-b; Tractate Avodah Zarah 43a-b. The scope of the prohibition against painting and sculpturing was debated by medieval commentators ofthe Talmud; see Ramban Tractate Avodah Zarah 43b "Hah de-Akshinan." Images from Hellenistic mythology dating from the second century a.D. have been found in mosaics in synagogues and in tablets affixed to coffins in the Galilee. These discoveries raise deep questions about the strictness of the practical observance of the prohibition against the making of sculptures and images in Jewish society ofthe Hellenistic period. E. R. Goodenough, in his book Jewish Symbols in the Graeco-Roman Period (New York: Pantheon Books, 1953-1956), IV, 2-44, claims that the existence of these images in synagogues in a context of ritual worship implies that the rabbis did not determine the lifestyle of the communities and that their leadership had become undermined at that time. Opposing opinions are expressed by E. Urbach, "The Rabbinic Laws of Idolatry in the Second and Third Centuries in the Light of Archeological and Historical Facts," Israel Exploration Journal (1959-1960), no. 3,149ff., no. 4, 229ff. Urbach claims that these pictures did not have any symbolic ritual significance but served only for aesthetic purposes, and furthermore that this usage derived from a change in attitude toward the prohibition on the making of sculptures and pictures during the second and third centuries, a change that took place within the world of the sages.

It is Onkelos's policy to replace representations of God with things he created in order to avoid corporealization. Maimonides discusses this many times in The Guide ofthe Perplexed; see, e.g., 1:21, 27, 28.</page><page sequence="7">Halbertal and Margal it: Idolatry and representation 25 linguistic representations of God. In many synagogues the hymn An'im Zemirot(\ will sing songs) is sung at the end of Sabbath morning services. One of the lines of the hymn describes God thus: "His head is covered with curls of light, his hair is like fragments ofthe night." Imagine if this line were illustrated and God drawn with a head of curly hair! The idea of drawing such a picture would not enter the mind of any observant Jew, in spite of the fact that the linguistic description in the hymn is one of the accepted parts ofthe Sabbath service. A never-failing source of blatant anthropomorphic images may be found in the Song of Songs. The song, which is interpreted as an allegory for the love between God and Israel, is full of bold linguistic descriptions of God as lover, whose cheeks are like beds of spices, whose hands are rods of gold, whose belly is a tablet of ivory, and whose legs are like marble pillars (see Song of Songs 5:13-15). It is not by chance that this song aroused the imaginations of the authors of the Shi'ur Komah literature, who extended and deepened the linguistic descriptions ofthe attributes and shape of God. The astounding degree of freedom accorded to linguistic descriptions of God, as opposed to the strictness with which pictorial descriptions were judged, confronts us with a crucial question in the understanding of idolatry: what is the distinction between linguistic representations of God, which seem to be not only permitted but even accepted, and pictorial representations of him? Is there a real difference between speaking about the hand of God and drawing it? Three approaches to this question are discussed below. Representation as metaphor One view holds that just as linguistic expressions can have metaphorical interpretations, so can pictures. A picture has a transparent quality, and just as the expression "the hand of God" is a metaphor for his power, so a drawing of God's hand can be such a metaphor. Michelangelo's famous painting can thus be interpreted as a metaphor for God's primacy, creativity, and power. The fact that the painting has a reference is not grounded in similarity-based representation. We are not required to say that the painting refers to something because it resembles the thing it refers to; it can also represent something based on a convention. There is no real distinction between a linguistic picture and an actual picture. Thus if the linguistic expression is taken at its face value, then the picture, too, should be permitted; and if the linguistic expression is interpreted metaphorically, why shouldn't the picture also be considered a candidate for metaphorical interpretation? The strategy for defending such a view is to abolish the existing distinction between linguistic representations, which are based on convention, and the similarity-based representations occurring in pictures. This is the view of Nelson Goodman, who believes that what is called similarity-based representation is not a natural form of representation that is innocent of all conventions and prior knowledge.18 A smile in a painting of one of Jesus' apostles might be interpreted as an expression of amiability, but if it turns out to be a painting of Judas Iscariot the smile will be seen as a representation of guile and cynicism. In other words, the identification of what the smile represents is not dependent on similarity alone. In general, according to Goodman, everything is similar to everything else, and the similarity that is attributed may sometimes be based on a certain trait ofthe representing thing to the exclusion of its other traits. The painting of a dog beside a knight represents the knight's loyalty, in spite of the fact that there is no other relevant similarity between the dog and the knight. Moreover, the very trait of loyalty possessed by the dog is not a trait that can easily be seen in a picture of a dog outside a specific cultural context. The process of singling out the similar traits depends on various conventions. The difference between similarity-based and convention-based representations evaporates, and with it the distinction between linguistic and pictorial representations of God. The essential distinction There is another view, however, which distinguishes between linguistic and pictorial representations in that the linguistic representation does not present the worshiper with an object that can be confronted in an attitude of worship, as an intermediary of God or a fetish. In a pictorial representation, the believer is actually confronted by an object. Even if the object is as transparent as language, and even if it can be given a metaphorical interpretation and need not be perceived as a similarity-based representation, there is nevertheless a possibility that the believer will transform the object into a focus of his attitude, into a ritual center of gravity. Thus idols not only represent on a basis of similarity but also become the bearers of the power they represent, because of their similarity to it. This blurring of the distinction between the symbol and the thing symbolized, which is so common in idolatry, does not occur in language because in the latter there is no concrete object that can 18. See N. Goodman, The Languages of Art (Indianapolis: Bobs Merrill, 1976), pp. 3-43.</page><page sequence="8">26 RES 22 AUTUMN 1992 be endowed with some of the powers of the symbolized thing. With pictorial representations there is always the fear that the representing object will at some stage be transformed into the permanent dwelling place of God himself or into a power with independent identity, whereas language does not create an object that can undergo such a transformation. This argument must be qualified by the fact that names are sometimes considered bearers of the power of the thing they denote, and a Torah scroll can become a fetish no less than any picture or image. To the above argument can be added another reason for the prohibition of pictorial but not linguistic representations, which is independent ofthe fear of substitution. When one says, for example, that God has a hand, the constituents of this hand, such as size and shape, remain undetermined. Even the addition of more linguistic details will not give the fullness of description that is provided by a picture ofthe hand. If the problem is the degree of exposure of God in a pictorial representation, then in the case of a linguistic description, since the representation always leaves some gaps, the degree of exposure of the thing described is less than in a picture. In accordance with this criterion, the Persian kings who spoke from behind a screen could be described linguistically but not represented pictorially. The source of this distinction is the notion that God may be heard but not seen. To the extreme opponents of corporeality, this distinction is not meaningful, as they do not see a difference between attributing the power of speech to God and attributing a physical shape to him. If, however, the problem is not corporeality but the degree of exposure of God to the hearer or the beholder, then the distinction is useful. The intuition that distinguishes between similarity based and convention-based representations gives priority to the "internal image," created from an accumulation of sense data, over linguistic representations. The following schema is often presented to describe the relationship between language and sense data, especially sight: we see the same object many times and this gives us a picture in our mind that abstracts the fixed properties of the object from the many instances of the object that we have seen. This is the "idea" of the object, to which we attach a word as a tag, and this gives us a linguistic representation. The linguistic representation is thus distanced from the concrete object because it depends on an idea that is created from the repeated appearance of sense data. The distance between language and object is mediated by the "idea," which is an internal image that a person has of an object, and this mediation produces the feeling that the linguistic description is less intimate and more distanced from direct contact of the senses, with respect to the object being described. Those philosophical standpoints that attacked this empiricist view of language, and described language as the mediator between objects and sense data, did not accept the approach that distances the linguistic representation from the represented object. The tag attached to a painting in a museum creates a different view of the painting. Changing the tag will create a change in perspective, so that people will see entirely different things in the painting. This is what would happen, in the example we gave before, if the tag under the painting of the smiling apostle were changed from Peter to Judas.19 As mentioned, the distinction between pictorial and linguistic representations has been attacked from both directions. On one side are those who abolish the distinction so as to permit pictorial as well as linguistic representations; on the other are those who prohibit both forms of representation and liken preserving the distinction to belittling the force of language and the serious consequences ofthe linguistic representation of God. To the latter group, language is even more dangerous than pictures because it states propositions and makes judgments. To say "God has a hand" is to assert a proposition, whereas a drawing of this hand is not a proposition. This propositional character of language can make it more dangerous than visual representations. According to this view, just as there is a ban on representations in ?mages and pictures, so there should be a ban on linguistic representations. The war against sculptured images and paintings is thus extended to linguistic images. The outstanding representative of this view is Maimonides, whose writings we discuss in the following section. "The Torah speaks in the language of people" To consider the third view?that there is no distinction between the two types of representation and that they are both forbidden?we must understand the expression "the Torah speaks in the language of people," which is central to Maimonides' treatment of linguistic representations of God, although it evolved from the talmudic sages. The primary meaning of the expression refers not to the use of language in describing God but to the application in the Torah of different rhetorical devices accepted in ordinary language. 19. In the opening paragraphs of Philosophical Investigations, trans. G. E. M. Anscombe (Oxford: Blackwell, 1953), Ludwig Wittgenstein attacks the concept of meaning as a tag that refers to an internal picture.</page><page sequence="9">Halbertal and Margal it: Idolatry and representation 27 The second-century discussion, which is the source of the expression, arose in the context of a debate between the schools of R. Akiva and R. Ishmael over how to interpret the doubled expressions that occur frequently in the Torah. When these expressions are translated into English, the doubling is omitted, as there is no such form of expression in English. To translate the expression literally, one would have to say, "Walk you walked," instead of simply "You walked," or "Kidnap I was kidnapped," instead of simply, "I was kidnapped." R. Akiva interpreted these expressions as conveying some additional meaning because he believed that there is no redundancy in the Torah. R. Ishmael, by contrast, asserted that one should not try to find the source of any halacha in these doubled expressions because the Torah simply speaks in the language of people. In his view, these expressions were not meant to convey an additional meaning that was not present in the first term but constitute a rhetorical device, as in ordinary speech, for the sake of emphasis.20 The controversy here concerns the proper rules of interpretation that must be applied to a sacred text. At the heart of the issue of interpretation, this issue is not whether the rules of interpretation are being used correctly, or which rules should be used, but whether or not a sacred text requires its own special interpretive code because its language is essentially different from ordinary language. Interpretation ofthe expression "the Torah speaks in the language of people" underwent an essential change before it reached Maimonides. This change, which began during the post-talmudic period,21 culminated in the writings of Maimonides, who treated it as his guiding principle in his great philosophical work, The Guide of the Perplexed. Whereas the previous controversy was about the redundancy of language, and whether the Torah uses the same language that ordinary people use, Maimonides turned the phrase into an expression of how the Torah speaks about God. In his view, the Torah describes God not according to the correct metaphysical picture but in a way people are able to understand. The Torah describes God in terms of heightened human perfection, because most people are unable to imagine any other sort of perfection than their own. Thus the Torah depicts God in material terms that the masses are able to grasp, and attributes to God those mental characteristics that people regard as perfection because these characteristics represent perfection when applied to people. The masses believe that "God would not exist if He did not have a body with a face ... except that it is larger and brighter" (Cuide ofthe Perplexed, 1:1). Maimonides applies the words "the Torah speaks" in the expression to speech about God, and the words "the language of people" to the language that people are capable of understanding, not necessarily the language that they speak. "People" at this stage is a term whose precise denotation is the masses?people who are unable to imagine the proper image of God. Thus Maimonides interprets each of the three parts of the expression differently from how the talmudic sages did. Maimonides' use of this expression brings us to the relation between language and idolatry. The first part of The Cuide ofthe Perplexed is devoted almost entirely to liberating the perplexed person from the difficulties of the language used with respect to God. At the beginning of the book Maimonides attempts to liberate the reader from the hold of the language of the Bible concerning the metaphysical image of God. This is the reason that biblical interpretation has such a central position in Maimonides' book. The language used in the Bible (and our taking this language at its face value) constitutes one of the primary causes of an incorrect image of God, whether in the attribution of material existence or in the attribution of emotionality. Maimonides teaches the reader that the language in which the Bible speaks of God is figurative language. An example is the use of the word "sitting" as attributed to God, which Maimonides discusses in chapter 11 of part 1. He says that the word is not attributed to God with the same literal meaning it has in the expression "Reuben is sitting" but is like the metaphorical biblical expression whose literal translation is "Judea will sit forever." In this expression the word "sit" refers to stability, as it does when it is used to refer to God. "Going up" and "going down" with respect to God also have a slightly altered meaning?something like going up or down in status rather than in space. Many expressions of physicality are used figuratively with respect to God just as they are used figuratively in ordinary language to speak of social relations. We say that a person is "the center of attention," clearly a reference not to a point in space but to a position in a 20.1. Heinemann, in his book Darchei ha-Haggadah (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1954), p. 12 and n. 106, attempts to bridge the controversy by claiming that everyone interprets doubled expressions as saying two different things, and there is no one who believes that the Torah speaks in the language of people. However, it seems that this is not the case and that there is an essential difference between the schools of R. Akiva and R. Ishmael on the issue. 21. The extension of the expression to the theological realm already appears in the literature ofthe post-talmudic sages. See Teshuvutha Geonim, ed. J. Musafia responsa of R. Hai Gaon, 98, Jerusalem 1967; and B. Lewin, Ozar ha-Geonim, Berakhot, 1:131, and Hagigah, p. 30.</page><page sequence="10">28 RES 22 AUTUMN 1992 social system. Understanding a figurative expression as a literal one with respect to God is, according to Maimonides, the great linguistic fallacy that leads to an erroneous metaphysical picture of God. In Maimonides' own words: When they [the rabbinic sages] said, "The Torah speaks in the language of people," they meant whatever all people are able to understand at first thought.... Therefore they described Him in terms that refer to material being, in order to teach that He exists, since the masses cannot grasp existence at first glance unless it is the existence of a body. (Guide of the Perplexed, 1:26) Thus metaphorical language blurs rather than clarifies distinctions, and it leads people astray because they tend to read the metaphors literally. A metaphor may often be clearly identifiable, as in the case ofthe sentence whose literal meaning is "Judea will sit forever" but whose obvious intended meaning is "Judea will be established forever." When the subject matter concerns God, however, the identification ofthe metaphor requires an extensive philosophical background. People know enough about Judea as a state to be able to identify "sitting" as a metaphor, but they do not know anything about God that would enable them to identify expressions referring to him as metaphors. If all people's knowledge of Judea were derived from the quoted sentence, then it would not be so easy to interpret "sit" as a metaphor. Since the masses do not have independent information about God, whose source is an external metaphysics, they do not have the capability of identifying expressions in religious language as metaphorical, even though they can do this easily in other areas of language. In the chapters that deal with figurative language in part 1 of The Guide ofthe Perplexed, Maimonides often shows that an expression is figurative by citing an example of its figurative use in a place where it is immediately understood as a metaphor, thus demonstrating that the expression is metaphorical when used to refer to God as well. This procedure is necessary because ofthe difficulty of identifying expressions as metaphorical with respect to God, in contrast to the ease with which metaphors about ordinary objects are identified. So far it has been assumed that there exists a pure, nonmetaphorical language that is free of this type of fallacy. In such a conceptual language, it would be possible to speak correctly about God, without the heavy burden of the use of figurative expressions for the purposes ofthe masses. Later in part 1 of his book, however, Maimonides takes an even more radical stance regarding religious language. He disqualifies language in general from being able to describe God by any positive attributes. He devotes this section of the book not to biblical interpretation or to an attempt to liberate the perplexed reader from the hold of biblical language but to a general attack on the very attempt to describe God in language. This attack is directed even at those who understand quite well that the Torah uses figurative expressions to speak about God. Hegel distinguished between religious discourse about the absolute, which is metaphorical, and philosophical discourse about the absolute, which is conceptual. Conceptual discourse, he asserted, is free ofthe distortions and imprecision of metaphorical language. But Maimonides' criticism of linguistic representation includes not only metaphorical religious language but also conceptual philosophical language. In his view even conceptual language is not transparent in issues relating to God. At this stage "the language of people" does not mean the language of the masses who are incapable of abstract speech but refers to language itself. Maimonides' purpose is to liberate the philosopher from what Wittgenstein would have called the mythological layer inherent in language in general. The discussion ofthe connection between language and the erroneous picture of God, which is the heart of part 1 of The Guide ofthe Perplexed, confronts us with a similarity between various points in the philosophy of language and in Maimonides' discussion of the limitations of religious language. Maimonides expresses his criticism of language in general as follows: "And these subtle matters cannot be distinguished by customary words, which constitute the great cause of misapprehension." Later in the same chapter Maimonides discusses the words "pr?existent" and "one" and their attribution to God, commenting: "None of these expressions are anything but the language of people." Here he is obviously referring to language in general. What is this misapprehension that results from the use of language with respect to God? Maimonides offers two principal answers. One is that the use of attributes impairs the simple unity of God. The structure of the sentence "God exists" or "God is one" creates a picture of an object to which different predicates can apply. But God's unity is his essence, not something added to his essence, and this is true of his existence as well. If, however, we consider these attributes not as predicates or accidents but as part of the definition of God, then we are creating a plurality in the very definition from a number of aspects. This criticism of the attribution of positive predicates to God is based on the negation of nominalist arguments that oppose granting predicates a different ontological status from that ofthe object being described. Indeed,</page><page sequence="11">Halbertal and Margal it: Idolatry and representation 29 nominalist arguments were used by various philosophers against the theory of negative attributes. For example, Ibn Rushed criticizes Ibn Sina on this very point, and the argument was used by Gersonides and Crescas against Maimonides himself.22 Maimonides' second argument against the ascription of positive attributes to God is that describing God with universal predicates such as existence puts him into the same category as other things to which these predicates apply. For example, we attribute existence both to God and to a table, but actually God's existence is of a different type, to which the familiar usage of existence does not apply. To give another example, if one says that God is pr?existent to the world in a positive sense, then one is attributing the concept of time to God and putting him into a chronological relation to the world. But since, according to Maimonides?who uses the Aristotelian definition of time?time is dependent on motion, the concept of time does not apply to God at all. One cannot say that God is pr?existent; one can say only that since he has no motion the concept of time does not apply to him. The attribution of predicates to God in language is nothing but a category mistake, like the attribution of length to taste. This mistake causes people to perceive God as belonging to the same category as other familiar things to which the same attribute applies. This error, in Maimonides' opinion, is so grave that the ascription of an attribute to God is an error with respect to his identity as a whole. A person who ascribes attributes to God should not be regarded as talking about God and making some mistake about him. Rather, such a person is not talking about God at all but about something else entirely. Extending familiar language to apply to God creates a category mistake rather than an ordinary error (Guide ofthe Perplexed, 1:58). When we speak about God, it is not really God we are speaking about but something else, and this is independent ofthe question of what we say about him. According to this view, the theory of negative attributes is meant to determine not the simple unity of God (as in the first view) but the absolute otherness of God and the essential categorical difference that exists between him and all familiar objects. The nominalist argument cannot be used against this claim because it relates to the problem of speech about God and the world with the same categories of predication in language, and not to the ontological duality that exists, so to speak, between the subject and the predicate. Language is thus limited and misleading in its descriptions of God for two reasons. One is that the basic structure of the sentence creates a duality of subject and predicate. The second is that there is a misapprehension in a description of God using the same linguistic categories that are based on the existence of our familiar reality. Language serves as an instrument for projection of the sort of perfection that is familiar to us onto God, who is the absolute other. Language thus crosses its natural boundary into another reality, and in this extension of language a misapprehension is created with respect to God. Maimonides summarizes these two claims in chapter 59: "And know that whenever you attribute some other thing to Him, you will be distant from Him in two different ways, the one because whatever you attribute to Him is perfection for us, and the second because there is nothing that belongs to Him, but rather His perfections are His essence." The degree of criticism of language in the theory of negative attributes depends on one's understanding of the starting point from which the theory is approached. One way to describe the motive for this theory is the skeptical way. The meaning of the theory of negative attributes is that we do not know anything positive about God: all we are able to know is what God is not (not what he is). This theory is thus essentially skeptical. Maimonides uses this line of argument when he describes the limits of understanding of the greatest of the prophets, Moses. All he was able to grasp were the descriptions of God through his actions, while everything else was negative. That is, to say that God is not nonexistent is not the same as to say that God exists. Even though the negation of nonexistence is logically equivalent to the attribution of existence, in the case of the theory of attributes the negation of nonexistence is not the negation of an attribute but a categorical negation. This may be compared to our saying of the wall that it cannot see, which does not mean that the wall is blind, because we are negating the use of the concepts of sight and blindness as applicable to walls in general. It would be more correct to say that the category of sight and blindness does not apply to walls. What characterizes a category mistake is that the negation of the proposition is wrong in the same sense as the positive proposition. A categorical negation does not imply anything positive. It thus turns out that the proposition that God is not existent is logically equivalent to the proposition that God is not nonexistent. The familiar category of existence that may be predicated of an object does not apply to God. The fact that we say, "God is not nonexistent," and that this expression is considered preferable to saying, "God is not existent," is a matter of determining which way of 22. See H. A. Wolfson, Studies in the History of Philosophy and Religion, ed. I. Twersky and G. Williams, vol. 2 (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1977), chaps. 6, 7.</page><page sequence="12">30 RES 22 AUTUMN 1992 speaking is appropriate to God and no more than that (Guide ofthe Perplexed, 1:58). Another view of the theory of negative attributes is that the problem is not in the impossibility of knowing God's essence but in its linguistic expression, as any attempt to formulate this knowledge in words creates an error. Behind the negative attributes, according to this view, a great deal of positive knowledge about God's essence is hidden, and it is only the attempt to formulate this knowledge in words that fails and is thus misleading. We know that all of God's attributes are his essence and not something added to it, but how could this be expressed positively without creating a duality between his essence and the attributes? This interpretation of the theory of negative attributes, which is not fundamentally skeptical, is taken by Harry Wolfson, and also, in a different version, by Julius Gutman. It constitutes a direct criticism of language. As Maimonides says: "Silence and limiting oneself to the apprehensions of the intellect are more appropriate." Beyond negation there is an intellectual understanding of God. It is possible "to understand appropriately," but the attempt to express this understanding in words is immediately misleading and creates error.23 The two trends found in Maimonides' discussion of this issue reflect two different attitudes toward the critique of language. One claims that there is a congruence between the possibilities of linguistic expression and of cognition, as according to this view the theory of negative attributes is based on the fact that nothing can be known about God's essence and thus there is obviously no possibility of expressing such knowledge. The second trend delimits not the boundaries of cognition but the boundaries of speech, and in this view there is no congruence between linguistic expressions and intellectually conceived knowledge about God. The attempt to give this knowledge linguistic expression is what causes error, since language is fundamentally limited in its attempts to describe this type of reality. The issue confronting us resembles the question discussed by the positivists concerning the meaninglessness of metaphysical expressions in language: does this meaninglessness express a skeptical attitude with respect to all possible metaphysics, or does it only negate the possibility of expressing metaphysical ideas in words? In our discussion we distinguished among three senses ofthe expression "the Torah speaks in the language of people." The first sense is that the Torah speaks the way people speak, and so redundancies in biblical language do not require a special type of interpretation that differs from the way we interpret people's speech. The second sense is that the Torah speaks about God in a way that the masses are capable of understanding, that is, metaphorically. The third sense is that the language of people is language in general in its attempt to describe God, and the Torah had to speak about God in language. The last two senses are directly related to the issue of language and idolatry. Biblical language creates a mistaken picture of God if its metaphors are taken literally, and so the reader must be liberated from this language in its literal sense. Moreover, the hold of descriptive language creates a duality in the description of God and impairs his simple unity. It also applies the same descriptive categories to the world and to God and thus impairs the absolute separation between God and the world. Maimonides devotes most of part 1 of The Guide ofthe Perplexed to liberating the reader from the hold of language, and the climax of this process is the silence recommended by the theory of negative attributes. Just as pictorial representations of God are forbidden, so are linguistic representations. The appropriate linguistic representation Even those who did not share Maimonides' view?that all linguistic representations of God are improper metaphysical descriptions and are thus forbidden?saw the need for constraints on representation. They perceived the limits of linguistic representation not in the representation itself but in the question of whether a particular representation is an appropriate one. This view categorized linguistic representations differently, as can be seen in various passages from the midrash. Consider, for example, the following midrash dealing with the revelation in the burning bush: R. Eliezer said, "Why did God reveal Himself from the high heavens and speak to Moses from the bush? Just as this bush is the lowest of all the trees in the world, so did the Israelites 23. Guide ofthe Perplexed, 1:59. For a moderate view of the theory of negative attributes as a criticism of language, see Wolfson, Studies in the History of Philosophy and Religion, II, chap. 5; J. Gutman, Dat u Mada Gerusalem, 1955), pp. 103-118. For a more skeptical view about the possibility of any metaphysical knowledge of God that is connected to the theory of negative attributes, see S. Pines, "The Limitations of Human Knowledge according to al-Farfabi ibn Bajja and Maimonides," in I. Twersky, ed., Studies in Medieval Jewish History and Literature (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1979), pp. 89-110. For an important discussion of this issue, see J. Stern in lyyun 38 (1989): 137 166. On Maimonides' epistemology see A.

R. Joshua said, "Why did God reveal Himself from the high heavens and speak to Moses from the bush? When Israel went down to Egypt the shekhinah went down with them, as is written, 'I myself will go down with you to Egypt' (Genesis 46:4), and when they went out the shekhinah went out with them ..." R. Jose the Galilean said, "Why did God reveal Himself from the high heavens and speak to Moses from the bush? Because it was holy, as the nations of the world did not use it for idolatry." (Mekhilta of R. Simeon bar Johai, on Exodus 8:3) The question asked by the three rabbis is a question that could be considered a metaphysical one: how could the Infinite confine himself to a small bush in the desert? How could the One who has no motion, as all motion is a deficiency, go down from this place and speak from a bush? A metaphysical answer to this question would deny that there was a revelation from the bush and would say that what happened there was only a prophetic vision, like a dream, or that the voice that spoke from the bush was created by God for this purpose and there never was any presence ofthe speaker himself within the bush. But from the various answers that are given in the midrash we see that the problem that was disturbing the rabbis was not a metaphysical type of problem at all. The question of why God revealed himself in the bush is not a question of how such a revelation is metaphysically possible, that is, how a nonmaterial being can embody himself in the material. Rather, the question is why the king of kings chose to reveal himself precisely from such a lowly object as a bush. If a state hosts a president and gives him a room in a cheap hotel, it is not performing a metaphysically impossible act but is showing disrespect for his status and putting him in an inappropriate place. Another example of this approach may be found in the Mekhilta interpreting the verse, "The Lord went before them in a pillar of cloud by day" (Exodus 13:21 ): "The Lord went before them in a pillar of cloud by day"? How is it possible to say this? Is it not written, "For I fill both heaven and earth?declares the Lord" (Jeremiah 23:24) and "One would call to the other, 'Holy, holy, holy! The Lord of Hosts! His presence fills the earth!'" (Isaiah 6:3) and "And there, coming from the east with a roar like the roar of mighty waters, was the Presence of the God of Israel, and the earth was lit up by His Presence" (Ezekiel 43:2). So how can the Torah say, "The Lord went before them in a pillar of cloud by day"? R. Judah said, "The emperor Antoninus would sometimes be speaking on the dais, and it would grow dark and it would be dark for his sons. When he left the dais he would take a lantern and light the way for his sons, and his ministers would come to him and say, 'Let us take the lantern and light the way for your sons.' And he would say to them, 'I am not doing this because there is no one who will take the lantern and light the way for my sons, but because I want to let you see my affection for my sons so that you will treat them respectfully.' Thus did God display his affection for Israel to the nations of the world, so that they should treat them respectfully. Yet not only do they not treat them respectfully, they even put them to death in harsh ways." (Mekhilta of R. Ishmael Va-Yehi, 6) As in the previous midrash, it only appears that the problem is a metaphysical one: how is it possible for one who is said to fill the world, and who is infinite and immaterial, to confine himself into a pillar and go before the camp in a pillar of cloud or of fire? The question seems to call for a response that would try to show that God did not really go before the camp but rather that an angel who was his messenger or a miraculous cloud appeared. But in this midrash as well one discovers the true nature of the question by studying the responses. The question here is understood as how it can be appropriate for one whose presence fills the earth to go before the camp: is it proper for him to go to this trouble, is it an appropriate appearance for one who fills heaven and earth? The midrash in its answer does not deny that God indeed went before the camp in a pillar of cloud but justifies this action by his wish to demonstrate his affection for Israel, just as Antoninus did for his sons with the lantern. The transition to the metaphor of father and sons explains the degree of closeness with which God behaves toward Israel and his deviation from the behavior expected of a king. The issue, again, is not whether the representation in question is metaphysically possible but whether it is appropriate, or, more precisely, what can be learned from the fact that God's attitude toward Israel is not that of an authoritarian ruler but that of a father toward his sons. What needs explanation is not the metaphysics of the Infinite that reveals itself in a finite pillar but the type of attitude that is revealed in this appearance, which is neither sublime nor awesome. This is the reason that the transition to the father-son metaphor provides the proper background for the answer. There are thus two aspects to the problem of anthropomorphism. One is whether it provides an erroneous picture of God. The other aspect of the problem is whether anthropomorphism provides a disrespectful and inappropriate picture of God. The midrash often discusses the problem in its second aspect, and the answers it provides concern the understanding of the relationship between God and Israel. God's confinement within the small bush in the desert is an</page><page sequence="14">32 RES 22 AUTUMN 1992 expression of his sharing in Israel's pain, and his going before the people in a pillar of cloud is an expression of his affection for them. A different attitude toward the problem of linguistic description is demonstrated in Maimonides' interpretation ofthe following story, which is related in the Babylonian Talmud: The leader ofthe prayers in R. Hanina's presence prayed as follows, "The God who is great and heroic and awesome and mighty and bold and fearsome and strong and courageous and respected." R. Hanina waited until he had finished the prayer and then said, "Have you finished all the praises of your Master? What are all these for? The three praises that we say?'the God who is great and heroic and awesome'?if Moses had not said them in the Torah, and if the Rabbis of the Great Assembly had not determined that they should be a fixed part of our daily prayer, we would not be permitted to say them. How then could you add all the others?" This may be compared to a king of flesh and blood who has a million gold coins and someone praises him for having silver coins. This would be a sign of disrespect for the king. (Berakhot, 33b) The extensive sequence of praises of God, which seems to constitute an attempt to exhaust his greatness, is disapproved of as being inappropriate. Moreover, it constitutes an attitude of disrespect for the king whose coins are of gold to praise him for having coins of silver, as any praises one is able to offer to God cannot equal his actual attributes. The multiplicity of praises beyond the ones that are determined by the tradition constitute disrespect rather than praise, and instead of increasing God's honor they decrease it. The problem of God's attributes here is the problem of appropriate representation: it is preferable to express fewer rather than more praises because it is precisely the multiplicity of praises that is inappropriate to the king. Maimonides, who quotes this passage, says about it, "Look first and see how the midrash flinches and distances itself from the multiplicity of positive attributes." Later, in his explanation ofthe parable, Maimonides stresses that the parable describes God's perfections as gold coins and the praises of him as silver coins, "to teach us that what are perfections for us are not of this type for Him at all, but they are all deficiencies with respect to Him. Whatever you may imagine in these attributes to be perfection would be a deficiency for God if it was of the same type as what is perfection for us" (Guide ofthe Perplexed, 1:59). In Maimonides' view, as we might expect, the story in the Talmud teaches the negation of all linguistic representations, as every perfection is only a perfection for us but is a deficiency with respect to God. Positive attributes are forbidden in general, and every ascription of an attribute is erroneous because there is a categorical distinction between God's perfections and the perfections that man ascribes to God through the use of language. It is thus in terms of quality rather than quantity that Maimonides explains the difference between gold and silver in the parable. Maimonides sees this passage as a continuation of his system of negating positive attributes in general and recommending silence. The problem of representation can be viewed from two different perspectives. One understands the danger of representation as a medium that creates mistaken conceptions of God. Therefore, God is not allowed to be represented in images and pictures because he has no image. If this is the logic ofthe constraints on representations, linguistic representations should also be prohibited, and Maimonides followed that logic and abolished the distinction between language and image. The other view on representation is more political than metaphysical. Representations are prohibited either because of the fear of substitution or because of the approach that minimizes exposure. One may talk about God's image, since the Bible suggests that he might actually have an image, but one may not look at his image.</page></plain_text>
