<plain_text><page sequence="1">Whitman and the Black Poet: Kelly Miller's Speech to the Walt Whitman Fellowship GEORGE B. HUTCHINSON University of Tennessee, Knoxville pROBABLY no white American poet has had a greater impact upon black American literature than Walt Whitman, yet the history, nature, and extent of this impact have barely been recog- nized, let alone analyzed. In studies of individual black writers -notably Arnold Rampersad's recent biography of Langston Hughes and Donald B. Gibson's essay on "The Good Black Poet and the Good Gray Poet"-Whitman's influence is par- tially brought to light, but there has been little effort overall to examine carefully the history of the black response to this poet who claimed to embrace all of North America, who strove to awaken diverse responsive voices in the "teeming nation of nations."1 In fact, far more is known today about Whitman's influence in the nations of Europe, South America, and Asia than about his influence in black America. The recorded black response to Whitman can be traced back to a speech Kelly Miller delivered to the first annual meeting of the Walt Whitman Fellowship on 3I May i895 and published in the July issue of The Conservator, Horace Traubel's magazine.2 Professor Miller was a well-known and influential dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Howard University, an important activist for black education who later played a minor part in the American Literature, Volume 6i, Number i, March I989.

Miller's speech, though virtually unknown today to scholars of either black literature or Whitman,' is an illuminating and in many ways brilliant one; in fact, it prefigures some of the most significant directions taken by black literature and criticism of the Harlem Renaissance. Embedded in this striking appreciation of Whitman's significance is perhaps the first systematic critique of "images of the Negro" in American literature-a kind of critique which has been of fundamental importance to the black literary tradition.5 Miller also points to both the economic and ideological foundations of literary racism while praising the example of Whitman in basing an "aesthetic" on egalitarian and democratic principles, implicitly pointing the way for black poets of the future. In the following discussion I hope to show the importance of Miller's speech in the history of black criticism as well as to illuminate, in part, the position 3 For biographical information on Miller, see especially the piece by E. Franklin Frazier in Dictionary of American Biography, 22 (Supp. 2), 456-57. 4 Miller is not included, for example, in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, Vol. 50, Afro-American Writers Before the Harlem Renaissance, ed. Trudier Harris and Thadi- ous M. Davis (Detroit: Gale, I986). The few extant discussions of his criticism do not mention this speech and are limited to brief references in introductions to reprints of Race Adjustment, although his open letter to Thomas Dixon, Jr., "As to the Leopard's Spots," has been included in such anthologies as The Negro Caravan, ed. Sterling Brown, Arthur P. Davis, and Ulysses Lee (94I; rpt. New York: Arno, I970), pp. 884-95; and Afro-American Writing, ed. Richard A. Long and Eugenia W. Collier, rev. ed. (University Park: Pennsylvania State Univ. Press, I985), pp. 236-47. 5 After Miller's speech, the earliest systematic analyses of the "image of the Negro" in American literature which I can identify-other than reviews of works of a particular decade or less-are Benjamin Brawley, The Negro in Literature and Art (I9I8; rev. ed. New York: Duffield, I929); William Stanley Braithwaite, "The Negro in American Fiction" (I925), in The New Negro, pp. 29-44; John Herbert Nelson, The Negro Character in American Literature (Lawrence: Univ. of Kansas Press, I926); and Elizabeth Lay Green, The Negro in Contemporary American Literature (Chapel Hill: Univ. of North Carolina Press, I928). Sterling Brown's important critiques did not appear until the I930s. The dates of these later studies aid us in seeing how Miller anticipated one of the more important interests of the Harlem Renaissance. This is not to ignore, of course, the implicit and sometimes explicit responses, in early black literature, to white stereotypes of blacks. I should also note that reviews of current literature concerning the race did appear in black periodicals of the nineteenth century.

For Miller's appreciation, and the reasons back of that appreciation, prefigure the later discoveries of James Weldon Johnson, Claude McKay, Jean Toomer, and Langston Hughes, to name but a few of Whitman's admirers of the early twentieth century. The date and occasion of Miller's speech themselves tell us something about the connection between the Whitman legacy and black American literature. Although the speech was later reprinted in a collection of Miller's essays entitled Race Ad- justment (I908), this was thirteen years after it was originally given, and the reprint failed to mention the date of compo- sition. The date is worth remembering; it was the same year in which Booker T. Washington gave his "Atlanta Exposition Address" and thus ingratiated himself with the white power- brokers who helped elevate him as a "leader" of the black race. It is decades before Benjamin Brawley's or Sterling Brown's influential works on "images of the Negro" in American litera- ture, six and a half years before the birth of Langston Hughes, and still over a decade before James Weldon Johnson's discovery of Whitman.6 Whitman at this time was still an "outsider" to the literary canon in an era when American literature was not taught in colleges and when only the "genteels" and their fore- bears-closest to the British tradition-were thought worthy of a discriminating reader's consideration. Miller's critique, pre- dating Whitman's "canonization," gives us some idea of why Whitman would later provide inspiration for important authors of the Harlem Renaissance. Moreover, the audience Miller addressed was, from both lit- erary and political standpoints, the forebear of various types of white audiences during the Harlem Renaissance. In the late I89os and early i9oos, such political radicals and civil rights activists as Eugene V. Debs, Emma Goldman, and Helen Keller considered The Conservator one of the most important magazines in the United States and regularly attended the Walt Whit- man Fellowship meetings. In many respects they prefigured the socialists and cultural nationalists associated with such maga- zines as The Liberator (for which Claude McKay was an editor) 6 On Johnson's discovery of Whitman, see especially his autobiography, Along This Way (I933; rpt. New York: Viking, I968), pp. I58-59.</page><page sequence="4">Whitman and the Black Poet 49 and The Seven Arts. These later writers, distinct from the "mod- ernists" more commonly taught today, sought the fulfillment of a "Transnational America"-anti-imperialistic and severed from European "colonialism"-in which the many "nations" of the United States would speak with their own voices, found indigenous literary traditions, and overcome the tragic split be- tween "highbrow" and "lowbrow" culture-which such writers as Waldo Frank and Randolph Bourne considered a legacy of "Anglo-Saxon" dominance.7 Taking Whitman as their prophet, these culture critics would be less interested in the "primitive and exotic" aspects of the "New Negro movement" than in its social and political significance and in its importance for the de- velopment of native art forms. The Seven Arts-which published McKay and whose guiding spirit, Waldo Frank, was to become Jean Toomer's closest friend and literary ally during the ges- tation of Cane (1923)-would call for contributions to support Traubel and The Conservator when that magazine was close to folding in 1917.8 Also connecting the Walt Whitman Fellowship with later interracial developments associated with the Harlem Renais- sance is the involvement in the group of such socialists and civil rights crusaders as Clarence Darrow and William English Walling. W. E. B. DuBois would call on the former as an attor- ney for some of the NAACP's most important legal cases. The latter helped found the NAACP, recruited DuBois to be its Director of Publications and Research, and, a few years later, authored the glowing book Whitman and Traubel (New York: Albert &amp; Charles Boni, I9I6). Links between Whitman enthu- siasts and black aspirations in politics and the arts would con- tinue well into the thirties, when Richard Wright would pen his early Whitmanesque poems. For example, in I927 Langston Hughes would be invited to speak to the Walt Whitman Foun- dation, an occasion which he described as "a great honor."9 Like 7 See especially Waldo Frank, Our America (New York: Boni &amp; Liveright, I919); and Randolph Bourne, "Transnational America," Atlantic Monthly, iI8 (I9I6), 86-97; rpt. in War and the Intellectuals: Essays by Randolph S.

Although Miller's tone in the essay seems moderate today, we would do well to remember that this was the period of perhaps the most virulent racism in American history, a period in which black writers were virtually condemned to invisibility, to con- cealing their race, or to pandering to white tastes in a type of "dialect" poetry reinforcing pernicious stereotypes. In contrast, Miller is quite forthright in his criticism of white expectations for black characters in literature. Miller's speech begins with accolades for Whitman as a "uni- versal" poet. According to Miller, "No class or clique or clan can lay claim to him and say, he is mine." Whitman is com- pared to Buddha, the Apostle Peter, Saint Paul, and all great souls who have dwelt upon "'the radiant summit'" from which one looks "with equal eye on all below." The critic here seems to be positing a romantic, Emersonian transcendence, and his language certainly supports such a position at first. "There is no variety of the human race that cannot find in him that which is adapted to their peculiar needs" (p. 70). Indeed, the speech as a whole supports the thesis that Whitman had transcended the limitations of other writers of his race and reached a higher plane of understanding, of "humanism." However, Miller is quite aware of the way in which "univer- sals" are frequently mystifications of specific ideologies. In par- ticular, he sees how the white writer or critic commonly projects 10 In the latter claim, Hughes was closer to the mark than his contemporaries T. S. Eliot and Amy Lowell, who got their vers libre from the French-not realizing that the French Symbolists they followed had gotten it in great part from Whitman. See Betsy Erkkila, Walt Whitman Among the French (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, I980), pp. 50-I74, 23I-34. As Erkkila shows, "the figures who have been put forth as the possible originators of French vers-libre have one common denominator: Walt Whitman. Rim- baud, Laforgue, Kahn, and Viele-Griffin were all aware of Whitman's poetic theory and practice before any of their own vers-libre appeared" (p. 92). Moreover, "Whitmanisme" was a pervasive literary cult in early twentieth-century France.</page><page sequence="6">Whitman and the Black Poet 5I "universal" standards of aesthetic beauty out of his or her own image, and how black standards of beauty therefore come to be implicitly rejected. The message (which perhaps has its roots in folk wisdom) prefigures "discoveries" of the Harlem Renais- sance poets and of black aestheticians seventy years later. Miller points out that "The anthropomorphic tendency is so strongly rooted in human nature that a people are apt to form their ideals in their own image and stamp upon them the impress of their own physical and social peculiarities. This circumstance renders any type unsuited to artistic or literary uses among a people of different 'clime, color, and degree.' 'Shakspere,' says a learned critic, 'ought not to have made Othello black, for the hero of a tragedy ought to be white'" (p. 70). Here Miller critiques the "white aesthetic" which, because of ordering principles founded in a specifically European hierarchy of "beauty," automatically judges black expression and character inferior. Miller implicitly understands, then, that any black artist operating according to standards of the "white aesthetic" has damned himself or herself from the start; the only way he or she can "succeed" is by be- traying his or her own nature. The dominant critical standards are inherently racist. Whitman, however, is one white author (possibly the only one in American literature, in Miller's view) whose work does not submit to the dominant aesthetic. Leaves of Grass represents a fundamental departure from both the typical rendering of blacks in American literature and the very ideology underlying the "aesthetic" according to which such renderings are judged valid. It is a fact of some significance that, in differentiating Whitman from the rest of the white literary tradition, Miller provides what may be the first systematic critique of the imaging of blacks in that tradition. The very outlines of that tradition, especially in its more subtle abolitionist form, come into sharper focus as one contemplates the critical "difference" in Whitman. Miller catalogues four basic modes of treating black subjects in American literature: i) "In the unadorned, didactic discussions of the race problem. ... Such works are mainly preceptive in their aim, and, strictly speaking, cannot be called literature at all." 2) "In the dialect story [the Negro] is portrayed as being igno-</page><page sequence="7">52 American Literature rant, superstitious, degraded, and clownish, cutting jim-crow capers and apish antics for the amusement and delight of white lookers-on." 3) "In anti-slavery poetry, the negro [sic] is pictured in his pitiable helplessness, and is sometimes endowed with manly qualities and courage, to serve as a more effective object lesson of the wrongs and cruelties of slavery. Whittier, Lowell and Long- fellow tuned their lyres to human liberty and did noble service for freedom by means of their songs. But, on close scrutiny, we find that, for the most part, these have the patronizing or apolo- getic tone.... This class of poetry reaches the high-tide mark in the kindly conceived lines of the poet, who, with conscious satis- faction of feeling, pays the negro the negative compliment of not being outside of the pale of humanity. . . . Contrasted with it, how refreshing are the lines of Whitman!" (Miller quotes lines addressing various races and including: "You dim-descended, black, divine-soul'd African, large, fine-headed, nobly-form'd, superbly destin'd, on equal terms with me!") 4) In recent novels, says Miller, "The negro is made the tragic representative of his own fate. These stories usually breathe the spirit of despair and death. They hold up no model, no ideal, no ambition, no aspiration for the youth of this race." Besides presenting these basic insights about the white imagi- nation of black character-identifying stereotypes which still pervade American culture and continue to affect the reception of black authors' works-Miller comes close to seeing the material "base" for the aesthetic "superstructure." Such images of the black race do not turn up in earlier literature of Greece or "the Orient"; they are coincident with the economic structure which has subjugated blacks since the European settling of America: "The growth and expansion of modern literature is coextensive with the rise and development of African slavery. This litera- ture is tinged throughout with the contemptuous disdain for the negro which he is made to feel in all the walks and relations of life" (pp. 70-7I). Only in Whitman's work does one find a freer atmosphere.'1 11 Like many poets after him-including those of the Harlem Renaissance-Miller was unaware of Whitman's personal prejudices concerning blacks, which are difficult to detect in the poems. Most of the evidence may be found in his early journalism, with</page><page sequence="8">Whitman and the Black Poet 53 Always a strong "race man," Miller points out that "com- pelled by circumstances to view all objects under a racial angle of vision, the negro, not unnaturally, seeks in Whitman some peculiar significance and specialty of meaning" (p. 70). Whitman is particularly important to the black reader because he was the first poet to base his practice on democratic/egalitarian premises -the first "American" poet in a sense that the black American reader can accept. He is a test case for the possibility of a native poetic tradition in which blacks can find themselves on equal terms with whites. "[I]n the literary realm of Whitman all are welcome; none are denied, shunned, avoided, ridiculed or made to feel ashamed. Indeed, Whitman's whole theory is a protest against such exclusion" (p. 7I). Miller has a keen sense of the revolutionary ideology implicit in Whitman's aesthetics, of the fundamental break the poet had made from Europe. He then applies the Whitmanian lesson to the condition of his own peo- ple. Whitman "has in his inimitable way described the degrading effects of European literature upon America. This degradation holds with added force when we apply it to modern literature and the negro." The degradation of black culture is one effect of America's continued colonial dependence upon European stan- dards, a dependence Whitman strove to break, thus pointing the direction for black poets as well. Whitman's call for a poetry grounded in the lives of the common people, a reversal of traditional hierarchies implicit in the older aesthetics, appeals to Miller's own desire for a new beginning for black literature. He quotes from Whitman: interesting additional remarks in Horace Traubel's With Walt Whitman in Camden, II (New York: D. Appleton, I908), 283; and VI, ed.

In the verse of all those undoubtedly great writers-Shakspere just as much as the rest -there is the air which to America is the air of death. The mass of the people, the laborers and all who serve, are slag, refuse. The countenances of kings and great lords are beautiful; the countenances of mechanics ridiculous and deformed. What play of Shakspere as represented in America is not an insult to America, to its marrow and to its bones? (P. 7I) Considering the particular implications of this passage for the black writer, one thinks of the critique of the "Prospero and Caliban" relationship in recent black cultural criticism.12 Miller appropriates Whitman's point for black art: "As a matter of course the negro can get no standing in that school of literature which runs wild over the 'neck, hair and complexion of a par- ticular female.'" Hence the critic sees, implicitly, that the black writer must undertake a revolt analogous to Whitman's. Miller calls for treatments of black subjects which assume the dignity of the folk (not trying to prove it), avoiding both the stereotyped "dialect" mode and the "Negro-as-victim" mode, while also de- parting from European-based, "feudalistic" aesthetic standards. Miller himself would write essentially in the Whitmanian vein in his best-known poem, "I See and Am Satisfied," but that poetic mode had certain fundamental affinities with tech- niques of the spirituals and of the inspired black sermon. As we now know, Whitman strove mightily to develop an "oral" and oracular style with religious and theatrical, even ritualistic, effects.13 In his earlier ecstatic poems, in particular, he literally 12 See especially Houston A. Baker, Jr., Modernism and the Harlem Renaissance (Chi- cago: Univ. of Chicago Press, I987), pp. 52-57, 6o-6I, and Janheinz Jahn, Neo-African Literature (New York: Grove, I969), p. 240.

Carroll Hollis, "Rhetoric, Elocution, and Voice in Leaves of Grass: A Study in Affiliation," Walt Whitman Quarterly Review, 2 (I984), I-2I. Interestingly, the central ecstatic sequence in "Song of Myself" has been analyzed as akin to the Haitian hounfor ceremony, in Robin Magowan, "The Horse of the Gods: Possession in 'Song of Myself,"'</page><page sequence="10">Whitman and the Black Poet 55 tried to put his audience into a sort of trance; techniques such as the "catalogue," anaphora, polyrhythmic repetition, kaleido- scopic imagery, and the use of the cursus at the end of each line indicate his important affinities with traditions of religious expression also rooted in Africa. At times Miller's speech itself takes on accents shared by the Emersonian/Whitmanian rhetori- cal mode and that of the black preacher. His speech is prophetic. Years later, James Weldon Johnson, after being "set floundering" by a mind-altering reading of Leaves of Grass, would begin the move away from Dunbar's type of dialect poetry. (Dunbar, inci- dentally, like his friend James Whitcomb Riley, rejected Whit- man and preferred the genteels, to whom the dialect poems ap- pealed and whom Miller implicitly attacks.) Johnson would, like Miller, write briefly in the manner of Whitman (drawing thereby harsh criticism from Dunbar), then turn to the example of the Irish nationalist and dramatist John Millington Synge before finally discovering a new method of rendering black expressivity in his version of an inspired sermon, "The Creation.""14 It was an important turning point in black literary history. Langston Hughes would undertake a similar journey, backtrailing home from Sandburg and Vachel Lindsay through Whitman to the blues, with results for black literature that are well-known. Miller, then, in using his reading of Whitman to position him- self vis-a-vis western literary tradition, simultaneously prefig- ures the function Whitman would serve for many black writers and critics to come. As adamant a black aesthetician as Addi- son Gayle would write, seventy-five years after Miller's speech, "Afro-American literature awaits its Whitman and the chances of this Whitman appearing are better today than at any time before." 15 An important point implicit in Miller's speech is that Whitman was not so much to be imitated as to be made to serve in the liberation of black (and white) consciousness: "America Walt Whitman Review, I5 (I969), 67-76. Studies of ritual spirit-possession in the African diaspora are well worth the Whitman scholar's attention. See especially Sheila S. Walker, Ceremonial Spirit-Possession in Africa and Afro-America (Leiden: Brill, I972). 14 See Johnson'sAlong This Way, pp. I58-59; and his preface to God's Trombones (New York: Viking, I927). Concerning Synge's influence on Johnson as a cultural nationalist, it is worth pointing out that the early twentieth-century Irish cultural nationalists found inspiration in Whitman, regarding him as a modern prophet. See Richard F. Fleck, "A Note on Whitman in Ireland," Walt Whitman Review, 2I (I975), I60-62. 15 The Black Situation (New York: Horizon, I970), p. 208.</page><page sequence="11">56 American Literature has broken the shackles which bound four millions of human beings to a degraded life. But the bondage of the body is nothing compared with the slavery of the soul. Whitman sounds the key- note of the higher emancipation" (pp. 71-72). The foundation of true emancipation, Miller emphasizes, is self-esteem, a faith in one's value by which one can transcend daily insult, knowing of a higher destiny in store: "Whitman has a special meaning to the negro not only because of his literary portrayal; he has positive lessons also. He inculcates the lesson of ennobling self-esteem. He teaches the negro that 'there is no sweeter fat than sticks to his own bones.' He urges him to accept nothing that 'insults his own soul.'" This sort of self-esteem would lead ultimately to the voicing of new literary modalities, distinctively black in origin. Hughes's important manifesto "The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain" reads, from this perspective, like a working out of the direction in which Miller pointed. Of course, such self-esteem was far from unknown in black expressive culture. In fact, Miller's response to Whitman seems partly grounded in black Christianity, the main values of which he believes Whitman shares. The suffering of the black race in America is not without meaning and will not be without reward: "If the woe and affliction through which this race have passed but lead to the unfoldment of their latent esthetic and spiritual capabilities, then the glory of tribulation is theirs." Perhaps this belief is the reason that in his best-known poem-in part imi- tative of Whitman's "I Sit and Look Out"-Miller can consider the whole history of the brutal oppression of the black race in America and say, "I see him who was once deemed stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted, now entering with universal wel- come into the patrimony of mankind, and I look calmly upon the centuries of blood and tears and travail of soul, and am satisfied." 16 "He takes the long view," as Sterling Brown would later judge, grimly; "one must say that it is very long." 17 But 16 "I See and Am Satisfied," in The New Negro Renaissance, ed.

Brown's judgment that Miller is closer stylistically to DuBois than to</page><page sequence="12">Whitman and the Black Poet 57 whatever the weaknesses of Miller's Whitmanesque pose in this poem, he uses that pose in an attempt to supplement certain strains of pathos and polemic in black literature. Clearly, the poet is experimenting with a new artistic stance toward one of the fundamental subjects of Afro-American literature. Moreover, the Whitmanesque vision of suffering has undergone a subtle transformation. In his speech to the Walt Whitman Fellowship, Miller sug- gests that black American expression, born of the historical experience of the race, will develop distinctive aesthetic forms. This suggestion follows inevitably from the nature of his appre- ciation of Whitman's "message"; for if "there is no sweeter fat than sticks to [one's] own bones," then there can be no sweeter song than the song of oneself. Miller believes, moreover, that Whitman himself "looks through the most degraded externals and forecasts the glorious possibilities of this people" in all the "arts" of civilization. Miller did not move on to the "discovery" of the vernacular, a direction Whitman had taken by adopting "slang" expressions from the lower classes and the "underworld" as well as words from Native American languages and black English, while striv- ing, simultaneously, to incorporate the rhythms of actual speech into his poems. But in catching the main thrust of Whitman's aesthetic theory, Miller did point the way, more than a genera- tion before the Harlem Renaissance, toward the historic shifts ac- complished by James Weldon Johnson, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, and Sterling Brown. Whitman would have a direct influence upon those shifts. Unaware of Miller's comments on Whitman, Brown would criticize the black romantic poets before the "renaissance," including Miller, for lacking precisely the self-esteem Whitman had taught-the confidence in the sig- ni'ficance of one's own experience and in the "unrhymed poetry" of the common people: "The lives of many of these poets were exciting; the difficulties met and surmounted would have been fine material for poetry.... Walt Whitman had heard America Whitman (not intended as a compliment) seems unwarranted if one compares Whitman's "I Sit and Look Out" with DuBois' "A Litany of Atlanta." Actually, Miller's style is closer to Horace Traubel's than to either of the more famous poets.</page><page sequence="13">58 American Literature singing, had included in his vast panoramas people like these poets. They probably did not read him; if they did, they pre- ferred Thomas Bailey Aldrich and Bayard Taylor. They chose to follow the current of American poetry of the time, but it was a current that led wearily to a lost bayou." 18 Unbeknownst to the critic, Miller had, indeed, at least turned in the direction Brown would travel. Implicitly, Miller's comments and their actual occasion can lead us toward a vision of the American space in which black and white tracks in literature cross-a vernacular "crossing" akin to that envisioned by Houston Baker in Blues, Ideology, and Afro- American Literature.19 As epigraphs to that book, significantly, Baker has chosen a stanza from a traditional blues song ("If you see me coming, better open up your door / I ain't no stranger, I been here before") and a passage from Whitman stating that the proof of a civilization is in its common people. The vernacular American crossroads interpreted by Baker as "placeless place" -liminal gate between bounded structures, variable "X" to be filled by any "I" that is listening, and exemplified by the blues "I"-is the "I" of Langston Hughes's "I've Seen Rivers," kin to the "I" of that "Song of Myself" which so influenced Hughes, coming as it did from another poet of the open road (and of the big sea).20 It is the "I" Miller heard in Whitman's chants and by which, evidently, he could be inspired. In examining the reasons for Whitman's "difference" from the rest of the "white" tradition, Miller provided a prophetic glimpse of the possibilities for a valid reconstruction of American literature on native grounds. 18 Brown, p. 58. 19 (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, I984). 20 See Hughes, "The Ceaseless Rings of Walt Whitman" (I946), in Walt Whitman: The Measure of His Song, ed. Ed Folsom, Tim Perlman, and Dan Campion (Minneapolis: Holy Cow!, I98I), pp. 97-98: "One of the greatest 'I' poets of all time, Whitman's 'I' is not the 'I' of the introspective versifiers who write always and only about themselves. Rather it is the cosmic 'I' of all peoples who seek freedom, decency, and dignity, friendship and equality between individuals and races all over the world .... Certainly, his poems contain us all. The reader cannot help but see his own better self therein."</page></plain_text>
