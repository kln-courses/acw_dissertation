<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW J. F. Ross, Portraying Analogy, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1981, xi+ 244pp., $34.50. Linguistic semantics of the past twenty years has been governed by a certain picture. Some people might say that linguistic semantics has been held captive by that picture, in Wittgenstein's pejorative phrase; some might even contend in addition that the picture is viciously false, and I think Professor Ross would be among them. The basic elements of the picture (hereafter, 'Lexical Atomism') are as follows. (A) [A strong form of the compositionality assumption] The meaning of a sentence is entirely determined by the atomic meanings of that sentence's individual component words (really morphemes) together with the syntactic rules and cor relatively the semantic rules according to which the relevant morphemes are combined and arranged into well-formed sen tences. (B) The atomic morpheme-meanings can be given by individual entries in a definitive dictionary of some sort - preferably clauses in a truth-definition either extensional or intensional. These meanings are fixed, by tacit convention, prior to any syntactical combination of the morphemes into longer con structions. (C) There are only finitely and manageably many morpheme meanings underlying any single natural language, or for that matter underlying the totality of all extant natural languages, primarily because any single morpheme-meaning in a natural language must be learned individually by any human speaker of that language in a determinate chunk of real time. (D) Lexical ambiguity in a natural language is neatly limited. Of course a word may have more than one sense, but the several senses it has may be crisply captured in a short, discrete list and treated by linguistic semantics as brutely homonymous or equivocal (otherwise its separate uses could not have been learned in so short a time by speakers). Linguistics and Philosophy 11 (1988) 107-124</page><page sequence="2">108 REVIEW (E) In addition to its ordinary literal meaning or meanings, a word might have some figurative - particularly metaphorical - uses as well. But although both philosophers and linguists rightly count it a great mystery how nonliteral meaning is derived from real meaning, figurative meaning is not only derivative but nearly negligible from the viewpoint of current active linguistic theory. Semantics proper studies literal meaning, though we would all admit under pressure that philosophy of language taken more broadly comprehends the question of how nonliteral meanings are generated from literal ones (and how they are related to literal truth-conditions). Metaphor especially is a surd in language that will need very special and arcane explanation once the more straightforward theory of literal meaning or "literal propositional content" has been straightened out. Several further theses are entailed by, presupposed by, or at least historically associated with the foregoing basic elements: (F) A word is either univocal or equivocal (ambiguous, homony mous), though perhaps most words happen to be ambiguous. (G) A sentence (of a natural language) has at least one deter minate logical form. Actually, due to manageable lexical am biguity as well as to equally manageable syntactic or structural ambiguity, almost any sentence has a multiple range of in dividual "readings" corresponding to distinct "logical forms" ascribable to that sentence in different contexts, but that range is not often large. (H) The meaning of a sentence consists in the literal truth-con dition(s) expressed by way of its logical form(s); truth-con ditions are determined compositionally by literal mor pheme meanings and syntactic-semantic rules (cf. (A) and (B)). (J) Atomic morpheme-meanings are a matter of important if conventional relations between individual words or mor phemes and (predominantly) nonlinguistic items in the world. The paradigms here are reference or denotation for singular terms and extensions or satisfaction-classes for predicates. I do not know of anyone who has articulated the foregoing picture in its entirety, though it is (rightly) associated with the works of Davidson,</page><page sequence="3">REVIEW 109 Hintikka, and Montague.' Correspondingly, Ross' book contains no explicit formulation of it as a target. But on the basis of many of Ross' remarks - see particularly the Introduction and Chapter 8 - I believe his book is intended in large part as a direct attack on Lexical Atomism, even though it has several more visible accompanying motivations. (Its main avowed purpose is the preservation, correction and extension of some valuable mediaeval work on lexical semantics; Ross is also con cerned to defend the meaningfulness of religious language.) At any rate, I think readers of Linguistics and Philosophy will be most interested in Ross' clearly implied criticisms of Lexical Atomism and in his own impressive contribution to lexical semantics. Ross proposes to "look for a systematic account of the meaning relationships different tokens of the same[-spelled] word have to one another" (p. 1). He champions an infinite-polysemy thesis.2 He holds (contrary to (C) and (D)) that virtually any word, even a pronoun, may take on any number of novel and distinct lexical meanings without limit, given a suitable variety of subsentential linguistic environments, and moreover in such a way that the novel meanings can be grasped on the spot by normal hearers. This is because novel word-meanings are generated in context from existing ones by intricate but quite tractable mechanisms of "analogy" that are mobilized by all normal speakers. And for the same reason, importantly, very little difference of word-meaning is "mere" or brute equivocation (contra (F)); the polysemous meanings are systematically interrelated. If it should be replied a la (E) that this is uninteresting even if true since "merely" figurative and particularly metaphorical usages are cheap, Ross responds by powerfully attacking both the distinctions presupposed by that reply: the distinction between (what we ordinarily take to be) literal meaning and "figurative" meaning, and the distinction between univocity and "mere equivocation" or homonymy (cf. (F)). Almost all word-meaning is derivative or (as we would say) "nonliteral" to some degree. The "analogy phenomena" in particular, including analogy of proportionality, simple metaphor, denominative analogy and paronymy, are ubiquitous. The analogy mechanisms all involve what Ross calls "differentiation": a word differentiates when it is forced to take on different meanings in order to adapt to different subsentential environments, normally to other words with which it is concatenated. A given word differentiates in context because the other expression "dominates" it in that context.3 (Some words are easily dominated, "dominated in a great variety of ways, especially common words like 'make', completed with 'time/</page><page sequence="4">110 REVIEW trouble/way/appointment/bed/money/merry/haste/cake/dinner/love/war " (p. 9); those are the words having the most diffuse variety of possible meanings. Other words are comparatively "intransigent" and, in practice at least, have very few meanings, though "all words are dominated some of the time.") The direct cause of differentiation is the interplay of "linguistic inertia" and "linguistic force". The first of those is the principle that two tokens of the same word have the same meaning unless something differentiates them; the second is the principle that words resist combining unacceptably in the linguistic environment, until forced to.... In other words grammatical strings will not go together unacceptably... if there is any step-wise adaptation of word meanings (comparatively to their other occurrences in the corpus) which would result in an acceptable utterance and is not prevented by the environment. And those step-wise adaptations are the specific kinds of differentiation described in this book. (p. 10) Thus when two words combine and one of them dominates the other, the dominated word adapts if adaptation is required in order for the resulting phrase to be "acceptable". "Sentences make what sense they can" (p. 11). By "acceptable" Ross does not mean merely grammatically well formed; the latter is by far the more inclusive notion. But he gives no general characterization of unacceptability, even though it is the most basic idea in his scheme; he is content to note that it is "variously based" (pp. 10, 81), to deny that logical inconsistency suffices for it (p. 82), to allude to "computability" on the part of "competent writer-speakers" (p. 58), and to certify that sentences may be "unacceptable" simply in that they are obviously false (p. 11) or for that matter too obviously true (p. 114). We are to get the idea more firmly from the book's profusion of examples. Speaking of examples, it is more than time for some here. To begin, I shall just list a few cases of fairly wide differentiation per se: (i) "She dropped a stitch"; "She dropped her hem-line"; "She dropped her book"; "She dropped a friend"; "She dropped her courses" (p. 33). Ross main tains that each occurrence of "dropped" in this list means something different. Moreover, "(t)he meanings... are appropriate, fitted to the completion words...." (ii) "He picked a date"; "He appointed a date"; "He fixed a date"; "He wanted a date"; "He borrowed a date" (pp. 80-81). Ross notes that these sentences are still ambiguous, and the ambiguity could be reduced only by the addition of wider contexts. (iii) "He charged the gun"; "He charged the jury"; "He charged her with murder"; "He charged him with responsibility"; "He charged more than</page><page sequence="5">REVIEW 111 the law allowed"; "He charged the boy too much"; "He charged the battery";... (paraphrased from p. 100). (iv) "Dead man"; "dead duck"; "dead silence"; "dead ringer"; "dead march"; "dead eye"; "dead end"; "dead head"; "dead assets"; "dead heat"; "dead bolt"; "dead lan guage"; "dead wrong"; "dead drunk"; "dead tired"; "dead boring"; "dead set (on)"; "the dead of winter." (My own example, offered in the spirit of Ross' view. Ross here and there observes, triumphantly but correctly, that once one is aware of the phenomenon one sees it every where.) (v) Prepositions such as "in" and "on" are notorious differen tiators, having virtually no constant meaning from context to context. (Ross himself does not stress prepositions, but Lakoff and Johnson (1980) make the point trenchantly.) The reader will have gathered that Ross individuates meanings very finely; one might well deny that all the foregoing word uses differ in meaning. Accordingly, in Section 3 of Chapter 2, Ross offers a catalogue of no less than twenty ambiguity tests, culled from Aristotle. The tests are eminently disputable, but he does not claim either completeness or decisiveness for them; he aims only at "a kind of reflective equilibrium reached through the feedback adjustments of both tests and intuitions" (p. 40). (Oddly, he makes no appeal to the tests proposed in Zwicky and Sadock (1975); nor does he consider the method of asking whether a sentence containing a term under investigation can simultaneously have more than one truth-value. Had he done so, he might have armed himself with a more incisive instrument for the defense of his ambiguity in tuitions.) In Chapter 3 Ross begins the serious and very turgid business of defining the technical terms that figure in his explanatory apparatus.4 It is here (Def. I1-11, p. 82) that "dominance" is explicated, in particular, and readied for use later on in the explanation of various specific kinds of differentiation. Ross' system of definitions is exhaustingly dense, with heavy jargon multiplying exponentially throughout the chapter (and beyond);5 someone who could sum up the main line of development concisely, accurately, and readably in a page or two would be a more talented reviewer than I. But I shall try to limn a bit of the strategy, though omitting quite a lot. Ross' initial idea (following Lyons, 1963, and ultimately the struc turalists) is that [t]o have meaning, an expression must be in contrast of meaning; it must have differential meaning - function contrastively to something else.... An expression paradigmatically contrasts with all other expressions that could have been inserted in its place [in a sentence whose remainder stays] substantially unchanged... to produce replacement sentences that</page><page sequence="6">112 REVIEW are semantically acceptable within the given environment and preserve the consistency or inconsistency [NB., not necessarily the truth-value] of the original. (p. 54) The set of all those other "co-applicable" expressions would be called the "paradigmatic set" for the original expression in its context (e.g., "The youth/young man/boy/urchin/girl/matron/etc. asked for a job.") A paradigmatic set begins to approximate to the sort of pattern of "affinities and oppositions" that Ross thinks makes for lexical meaning. However, we cannot just go ahead and identify a word's meaning in context with its paradigmatic set, for "[paradigmatic] sets may be the same when the tokens differ in meaning and... the sets may differ when the tokens are the same in meaning" (p. 63). Ross wants to say that only some of the members of an expression's paradigmatic set are "meaning relevant" to that expression. Very roughly, a member is meaning relevant to it just in case, though it is co-applicable in the given context, it is in at least one other context not co-applicable with it, "where the not being co-applicable (or not being in the same affinity or opposition of meaning) marks a meaning difference" (p. 66). This last quoted qualification is crucial. Consider (p. 67) "When Smith first married, he married his first cousin." "His aunt's son" can be substituted for "his first cousin" when "married" means "performed a marriage", but not when it means "entered into marriage"; yet this indicates no difference in the meaning of "cousin" across the two types of occurrence, but is due precisely to the different meanings of "mar ried", and so the difference of paradigmatic set for "cousin" in the second case does not suffice for difference of meaning. Once the foregoing qualification is observed, however, Ross contends that the meaning-relevant co-applicables of an expression in a context can be isolated. He says they turn out to be, "[o]n the whole, the near synonyms, the contraries, the determinables, the determinates, and the predicates of correct contextual definitions ...." And this set of "affinities and oppositions" does seem to be a plausible candidate for specifying lexical meaning. Consequently Ross introduces the notion of a "predicate scheme" (p. 63), narrower than that of a paradigmatic set. An expression's predicate scheme in a context is that proper subset of its paradigmatic set whose members are meaning-relevant in the sense defined.6 Out of context, of course, an expression belongs to each of many different predicate schemes; context reduces ambiguity by narrowing down the number of schemes. Where there is a scheme difference for the same word, the contrast between the two</page><page sequence="7">REVIEW 113 completion expressions... selects the scheme, e.g., 'wanted': 'The beggar wanted money'; 'The bearing wanted oil'. The selection process is exclusion through the resistance (intran sigence) of the completion expression to concatenating with any scheme for 'wanted', that contains any word that, substituted for 'wanted', would yield an unacceptable utterance. (p. 81) The second of these two quoted sentences summarizes "dominance"; the completion expression dominates the term whose scheme-indifference is thus reduced. (NB., dominance is not antisymmetrical; each of two concatenated expressions can dominate the other so long as they dominate in different respects (pp. 51-52).) An example: 'Pen' is indifferent to instrument schemes (that include 'pencil', 'quill', 'stylus', etc.) and to enclosure schemes (that include 'stall', 'paddock', 'run', etc.). The verb 'wrote' is indifferent to means expressing schemes (that include 'telephoned', 'telegraphed', 'semaphored with', 'drew with', 'inscribed with', 'signed with', etc.). Yet, concatenated into 'He wrote with a pen', 'wrote' is not indifferent to the enclosure scheme for 'pen'; rather, it is resistant because it belongs to a means demanding scheme which, concatenated with that enclosure scheme, would in the supposed environment yield an unacceptable sentence, e.g. 'He wrote with a barnyard enclosure'. 'Wrote' dominates 'pen'. And 'pen', thus dominated, reciprocally dominates 'wrote' to exclude the means expressing scheme ('telegraphed', etc.) because that result would be similarly unacceptable. (p. 86) Ross now sets out (Chapters 4 and 5) to apply his apparatus to the "analogy phenomena," thereby to show how mere equivocation, analogy of proportionality, metaphor, denominative analogy and the like differ from each other and how in particular they are differently caused by dominance. I shall shortly discuss one illustrative case, that of simple metaphor, but first let me register a tentative criticism (tentative because I cannot be sure I have the details of Ross' project right). The criticism is that the explanatory apparatus as described gives off a strong air of circularity. Difference of meaning is explained in terms of dominance; dominance is defined in terms of predicate schemes; the notion of a predicate scheme is obtained by adding the meaning-rele vance condition to paradigmatic-set membership. But meaning-rele vance is defined squarely by reference to difference of meaning (Def. III-9, p. 68): to quote Ross' own gloss on the official definition, "[t]he meaning-relevant words are the ones whose not being co-applicable somewhere else marks a difference of predicate meaning" (p. 67). So I cannot for now discern the source of the whole apparatus' explanatory power. There is no obviously recursive element in any of the definitions, so Ross is not specifying one kind of meaning difference and defining or explaining other kinds derivatively by reference to the first kind. On the other hand, the official definition includes the phrase "on serviceable tests for equivocation", alluding, we may gather, to the</page><page sequence="8">114 REVIEW twenty Aristotelian ambiguity tests I mentioned earlier. Perhaps "basic meaning difference" could be operationally defined in terms of the tests, and then differentiation of various special kinds could after all be defined and explained in terms of basic meaning difference. Yet (a) the tests are supposed to be more or less adequate to our intuitive judgments of ambiguity, not operational definitions, and (b) one feels that the success of the tests should be explained by genuine meaning difference, not the other way around. Or perhaps Ross' claim is only that if we take for granted an intuitive sense of meaning difference, constrained in "reflective equilibrium" with the ambiguity tests, we can by his means expand it into a finely-tuned instrument for at least predicting all the analogy phenomena. Yet if predicate schemes are just deliberately mocked up to match intuitive differences in meaning, then explanation of differentiation in terms of dominance still seems something of a "dor mitive virtue" explanation. But let us proceed to look at Ross' account of metaphor, both for illustrative purposes and because metaphor is prob ably the most interesting of the analogy phenomena to workers in the rank and file of linguistics and the philosophy of language. Ross initially characterizes "simple metaphor" as a meaning relation ship satisfying the following description: [S]ame words, taken in pairs, that differ but are related in meaning. Some near synonyms... of the one instance are also near synonyms for the other. Further, the difference in their meanings is marked by a difference in the group of meaning-related other words that can be substituted for the two instances.... [They] also satisfy an additional condition of asymmetry. Roughly, certain meaning-related words substitutable for the non-metaphorical occurrence are not substitutable for the metaphorical occurrence, even though other words 'implied' by those very words are substitutable and are part of what is meant. (p. 7) Simple-metaphorical occurrence is an obvious case of dominance and "linguistic force", since the unacceptability in some sense of the literal reading is proverbially what enforces the metaphorical reading. And Ross reminds us, as is his custom, that this process is automatic, a dynamic feature of language itself. "Metaphors don't have to be made, they can just happen as words fit their contexts" (p. 113). Ross starts with Goodman's (1968) idea that a metaphor is created when a word belonging to a label scheme or classificatory scheme... that has a certain prior realm of application... is subsequently applied to something not belonging to that realm and, by implication, segments the realm into ranges of referents corresponding more or less well with the contrasts among the original label scheme. (p. 110). But Ross complains that Goodman's idea explains neither "what the</page><page sequence="9">REVIEW 115 contrasts within the label scheme consist in", nor "how those contrasts are preserved in the application to a new realm", nor why the metaphor relation is asymmetrical (pp. 110-111). According to Ross, [t]he asymmetry is created by the mandating of a double presupposition, an 'implying' and an 'implied' presupposition in the literal token, and by the mandating [via dominance] of the (relatively) 'implied' presupposition in the metaphorical token and the exclusion of the 'implying' contrast. (p. 112) This needs a bit of explanation (and took me some time to figure out). The members of a predicate scheme contrast with each other. To take Ross' own example, the word 'swept' contrasts with other cleaning terms such as 'washed', 'polished', 'mopped', 'scrubbed' and 'dusted'. Each action verb in this scheme implies a corresponding physical motion, a corresponding apparent motion, a corresponding effect, and the like. The physical-motion verbs contrast with each other in a way parallel to that in which the original action verbs do; so do the apparent-motion verbs, the effect descriptions, and so on. Thus, according to Ross, the original contrast in the predicate scheme of cleaning terms as a whole implies each of the other contrasts. Now, simple metaphor occurs when a subsentential environment applying to a word such as 'swept' excludes (on pain of unacceptability) one presupposition of its intrascheme con trast, such as that of sweeping's being the act of a living person, but "mandates" or enforces one or more of the implied contrasts. Thus 'The clouds swept the moon', 'his gaze swept the crowd', etc. Ross maintains that this feature accounts for the asymmetrical character of the metaphor relation, over and above the mere fact of differentiation enforced by unacceptability. Ross denies (p. 114) that metaphors need be literally false. Some are, when the unacceptability that causes differentiation is egregious falsity. When the unacceptability is rather "linguistic nonsense" of the category mistake sort (assuming there is any such thing as opposed to mere egregious falsity), the literal reading if any will be truth-valueless. However, when the unacceptability takes the form of triviality, as Ross says it can be ('He's a thing'), the literal usage is true. It all depends. Some writers use "figurative" as a synonym or near-synonym for "metaphorical". Ross declines to join them, for he thinks that simple metaphor per se is just one of several analogy phenomena albeit a distinctive one, and is no "less literal" than is, say, analogy of propor tionality; moreover, few of the standard "figures of speech" require metaphor at all.7 He offers (in Chapter 6) his own analysis of "figurative" or "heightened" discourse that presupposes metaphor but goes beyond it.</page><page sequence="10">116 REVIEW What is distinctive of such discourse, he says, is stepwise double differentiation involving both metaphor and analogy of other sorts. Here is an example, accounting for the figurativeness of the verb in 'The critics paddled the directors' as it occurs in a poem about a play's closing: Denominative differentiation of the name of a process (to paddle) to name an instrument (a paddle). The instrument name for a kind of tool (a paddle) is abstractively differentiated into an instrument not a tool (a ping-pong paddle). Then by metaphor an instrument name for a game (a ping-pong paddle) is made into a name for a weapon, so that 'initiates are paddled'. Next, a reverse denomination, where the name for the instrument is differentiated into the name for the process of using the weapon, 'to paddle the initiates'. Finally, by analogy the process name is differentiated abstractively to mean 'punish', in the sense of 'inflict deserved condemnation', so 'the critics paddled [the] directors' by inflicting deserved castigation. Through this somewhat fanciful sequence, we have adaptations that involve: denomination, metaphor, denomination, and abstraction. (p. 147) Ross' "general hypothesis" is that figurative and other complex meaning relatedness can always be "decomposed into stepwise atomic adaptations... whose structures are ubiquitous and law-like in the corpus of natural language." I am not sure how the one metaphorical step in the foregoing sequence of adaptations fits Ross' earlier characterization of metaphorical asym metry. The original contrast would be between ping-pong paddles and other sporting instruments such as bats, racquets, golf clubs and so on. That contrast "implies" a contrast between various different arm motions, a contrast between various different kinds of projectiles; and the like. Does 'paddle' differentiate into the name of a weapon by the exclusion of its presupposition of being used for recreation, or on inanimate objects? (Weapons can be used for recreation, or on inanimate objects.) Moreover, what "implied" contrast is mandated by the newly metaphorical "weapon" use of 'paddle'? I suppose, that between the arm motions, since paddling a person involves a different arm motion from beating or clubbing, but I am not sure there is a fully parallel contrast set corresponding to all the different kinds of sporting equipment that would inhabit the predicate scheme for 'paddle'. This sort of discussion must be carried on across a broad range of examples of simple metaphor, to see if they all do fit Ross' pattern, in order for his theory of metaphor to face and pass empirical testing. So far, the theory is a daring and untried though not implausible conjecture. It is time to note two more (quite tendentious) features of Ross' overall view, and to record a few objections. (Following that I shall look briefly at his two concluding chapters and assess the impact of his discussion on Lexical Atomism.)</page><page sequence="11">REVIEW 117 First, Ross is no friend of Grice; he is an anti-intentionalist. Over and over he stresses, "[a]t the risk of being exasperating" (p. 118), that the adaptations and other dynamic linguistic phenomena he talks about are "automatic, irresistible, non-intentional, law-like and clearly intrinsic to the linguistic expressions in which they occur." "Writing and speech are not encodings of one another or of something in the mind" (p. 22); rather, au contraire, speech is itself a medium of thought, and fortunately so, for in this way the analogy mechanisms are able to do part of our thinking for us. Now we can think in the distinctions of word meaning without having, continuously, to think of the distinctions of word meaning. (p. 100) Language has a causal structure of its own, independently of what anyone thinks about it or what anyone's intentions are. I sympathize with this, having defended a related thesis myself (Lycan, 1984). But the closest thing to an argument Ross gives for it is to say (p. 11) that "[t]here simply could not be" infinite polysemy based on linguistic force and so on "if linguistic meaning were not something intrinsic to the language and distinct from speaker-meaning... ." Why not? Granted no speaker could intend all that infinite polysemy or even more than a minuscule fraction of all the differentiation that occurs in her speech every day, it still might be the case that linguistic meaning is parasitic on speaker-meaning, for speakers' internal systems of represen tation may exhibit analogy mechanisms and infinite polysemy as well. Might thinkers not differentiate silently, without vocalizing? Further, we know that reference to speaker-meaning cannot be expunged from our theory of language, since virtually no sentence is ever fully unambiguous on an occasion of its utterance, and hearers still have to compute speakers' intentions in the course of disambiguating in communication (I do not know whether Ross means to deny this). The second tendentious feature of Ross's view disturbs me a good deal more. It is a kind of general linguistic solipsism, hand-in-hand with his anti-intentionalism: He contends that lexical meaning has no more to do with reference or any other word-world relation than it has to do with speakers' intentions. It has too long gone unchallenged that what words 'man' concatenates with acceptably... depends upon what it stands for.... Is it not obvious that what 'man' stands for is affected (perhaps, determined) by what words it concatenates with (in a given environment)? It is time to disentangle 'reference' and 'standing for' from some kind of labeling and consider it as another mode of linguistic meaning. (p. 135) Moreover Ross denies (p. 48) that words out of context already have "context-neutral kernel[s] of meaning" that adjust or adapt when the</page><page sequence="12">118 REVIEW words are combined. "Outside a context a word has no signification at all (nor any denotation)...." Lexical meaning is exhausted by "patterns of affinities and oppositions... to other words" and "can be [adequately] represented as the pattern of such relationships (p. 107). Here as before, the argument is only that "[t]here simply could not be" analogy mechanisms of the sort Ross' book is about if lexical meaning were even in part a matter of reference. But here it is even less obvious why we should grant that assertion. (Perhaps Ross is thinking that if meaning were in part the determination of reference, then for a word to differentiate its utterer would have to check on and manipulate its referent in some way, but that is not true either.) And there are several strong reasons not to share this neo-structuralist disdain for word-world connections. First, note that differentiation presupposes an antecedent meaning to differentiate from. On pain of regress, there must be "absolute", pre differentiation word meanings. Ross is aware of this but does not care. His book is simply not about absolute meaning. He complains that theor ies of absolute meaning do not account for (and usually do not recognize) the analogy phenomena.... I venture that absolute meaning is to a far greater extent dependent upon antecedent relative meaning... than the reverse, and that the idea that primitive humans endowed grunts and twitters with ranges of referents (and subsequently with rules of combination) is pure superstition. (p. 14) Yet this ignores the regress. Meaning that is "dependent upon ante cedent relative meaning" is relative meaning, not absolute. What are we to say of absolute meaning? The field is open to those of us who would identify it with a well-behaved extensional or intensional word-world relation. Yes, Ross might concede, but the field is also still open to his neo-structuralist idea. Granting that there is absolute meaning that is in no way the product of differentiation and the analogy mechanisms, it still may be entirely a matter of "affinities and oppositions", word-word rather than word-world relations; the existence of absolute meanings does not refute that hypothesis. Perhaps not. But it is a good deal harder to see how primitive people would have established complex patterns of affinities and oppositions than it is to see how they would have endowed grunts and twitters with ranges of referents. And there are at least two further objections to Ross' linguistic solipsism.8 One is that meaning plus fact determines truth: If you know the meaning of a sentence and you are omniscient regarding fact, then you know the sentence's truth-value. Referential semantic</page><page sequence="13">REVIEW 119 theories explain that fact straightforwardly, by assigning truth-conditions to sentences, compositionally out of relations of terms to their extensions according to various compounding rules. How might Ross explain it without appeal to extensions? Indeed, it is hard to see what his view has to do with truth at all, or how he might even begin to see truth as determined by meaning plus fact. My remaining objection invokes a "Twin Earth" hypothesis in the style of Putnam (1975). Suppose that somewhere in outer space there is a planet just like ours, molecule for molecule, running along exactly in parallel with our own Earth (its water is even H20, unlike Putnam's own Twin water). Its inhabitants speak a language that sounds just like Earth English. Let us call the other planet "New Earth," in honor of the only difference between it and Earth proper: it came into existence just a few days ago, complete with memories, records, geologic strata and so on. As I said, the language spoken by the denizens of New Earth - New Lycan, New Ross, New Putnam et al. - is just like English in all its "intrinsic" features. In particular, the patterns of affinities and opposi tions that obtain between expressions of New English are exactly like those that obtain between the corresponding expressions of English. It follows from Ross' view that the expressions of New English have just the same meanings as their English counterparts. Yet whenever the inhabitants of New Earth speak of their past (simultaneously and in parallel with our own utterances about Earth history), their assertions are false; New Babylon, New Frege, New Chernobyl and so on never existed. Now, how could two sentences having just the same timeless meanings differ in truth-value? Moreover, it is fairly clear why cor responding English and New English sentences do differ in truth-value: it is because their terms differ in their extensions. We Earthlings succeed in referring to Babylon, Frege and Chernobyl, while (through no fault of theirs) the New Earthlings do not often succeed in referring at all. I conclude that Ross' view is seriously deficient, and that we have powerful motives for reintroducing referential relations into lexical semantics. Nonetheless we can separate the defective component of Ross' theory fairly sharply from what I am persuaded is its genuine contribution. For his linguistic solipsism, and even his (so I claimed) potentially circular account of dominance, are independent of his ideas about infinite poly semy and its origin in differentiation driven by dominance. Those ideas may be perfectly true, even if some quite different explication of dominance is needed and even if we grant that reference is required as an element of lexical meaning. Indeed, Ross has fairly well convinced me,</page><page sequence="14">120 REVIEW against my will, that they are true, and that Lexical Atomism needs re-examination. So let us assume their truth for the sake of argument, and see what conclusions should be drawn. I begin with Ross' two remaining chapters. In Chapter 7 he is concerned to defend the meaningfulness of religious language against the charge that religious assertions stretch the uses of anthropomorphic terms so far out of their normal boundaries that they cannot have their normal meanings and that even their analogical uses are too attenuated to be literally meaningful. (Needless to say, if a re ligious assertion is not literally meaningful then it is not literally true either.) Ross argues, predictably, that analogicalness does not entail mere equivocation, and that if chains of stepwise adaptation connect religious uses of terms to less exotic uses, there is no a priori reason to insist that religious utterances are "nonliteral" or otherwise to be patronized - at least no more so than a great many other sorts of utterances whose truth we are entirely comfortable with. I find this point quite convincng. However, Chapter 8 attacks truth-conditional theories of meaning, and that I do not find convincing at all. Naturally Ross accuses truth conditional theorists from Frege to the present of ignoring the analogy mechanisms, and he is right, but this in itself does nothing to show that what the truth-conditional theorists did say is false. We need to see arguments leading from premisses about the analogy phenomena to conclusions that impugn the truth-conditional program. But Ross offers just one such argument, a sketch at that (pp. 188-189). It runs more or less as follows: Truth-conditional theorists presuppose a level of "logical form" that is abstracted away from a sentence's surface-grammar and from apparent word meanings. But once the analogy phenomena are properly respected, "logical form" goes relative - or at least, the required assumption of univocity of the "logical" expressions that define "forms" fails more often than it holds. (Incidentally, Ross has some very illuminating things to say about the use of "conceptual analysis" in philosophy and about the method of chisholming; Chapter 8 should be required reading for anyone who admires and/or practices analysis.) I would respond that in speaking of valid inference-patterns one always assumes by hypothesis that the words involved are univocal, however seldom words may occur univocally in real life; no definiton of validity makes any empirical commitment to how often univocality obtains. Ross is right to warn us that the use of truth-conditional methods in the actual study of texts would be seriously hampered by the ubiquity of the analogy phenomena. But the truth-conditional notion of logical form, admittedly</page><page sequence="15">REVIEW 121 idealized, is unimpugned, and the truth-conditional project per se un scathed. Actually, in the course of the chapter Ross hints at several objections to truth-theoretic semantics that are unrelated to the analogy phenomena; I shall mention them and comment seriatim. (i) It is unclear what truth-conditional theorists mean by "knowing a sentence's truth-condition," and at least one ontological interpretation of that slogan (due to Wiggins (1971)) runs into an unhapy dilemma (pp. 181-182). Response: Yes, one has to be more careful in stating one's epistemic thesis than Wiggins was in the article Ross has singled out for attack. I for one have tried to get this right, in Lycan (1984). (ii) "Meaning is inherent in English sentences, not attached, as to a code" (p. 183). Ross seems to think this cuts against truth-conditional semantics. Response: That depends on just what it is that Ross is denying. Sen tences have the truth-conditions they do regardless of any one person's or group's beliefs or intentions, just as Ross says words have their affinities and oppositions. Nonetheless meaning is conventional, in that but for the existence of social practices generally, however diffusely characterized, a string of words might have meant something other than what it does mean, or have meant nothing at all; if in the statement quoted above Ross intended to deny that truism, then he is simply wrong. (iii) Sentential meaning cannot be identified wth truth-condition because sentences can be used to perform illocutionary acts other than that of stating or asserting, and because deictic sentences make different statements on different utterance occasions (p. 184). Response: Both premisses are true, and both have caused well-known problems for the truth-conditional approach. However, the problems have proven to be tractable, and are by now rather well in hand (see, e.g., Lewis, 1972; Lewis, 1980; Lycan, 1984, Chapters 3 and 6). (iv) Knowledge of truth-conditions is insufficient for knowledge of meaning, since I can know the truth-condition of a sentence that I do not understand. Response: I believe this is right (see Lycan, 1979, forthcoming). It does not, of course, count against the thesis that knowledge of truth-condition is necessary for knowledge of meaning. I am still puzzled as to what further condition might be needed. I do not see that Ross' arguments have done much damage to the truth-conditonal program. But I think his discussion as a whole has done</page><page sequence="16">122 REVIEW considerable more damage to the Lexical Atomist picture. I shall close this study by reviewing the tenets of Lexical Atomism and seeing how much of the picture survives contact with infinite polysemy and the analogy phenomena. Thesis (A) still comes out true, so far as I can see; even if every word in a sentence has differentiated all over creation, the meaning of the whole sentence is still determined by the (however analogical) meanings of the words together with their mode of compounding. But this affirma tion of (A) must be qualified by a denial of (B). Only the most common atomic morpheme-meanings can be listed in a dictionary; other perfectly possible meanings will always be left out. And most ordinary meanings cannot be fixed prior to syntactical combination of the morphemes into longer constructions. (Though if there are absolute meanings, these can be so fixed.) (C) becomes equivocal. If polysemy is infinite, then a fortiori there are not only finitely many morpheme-meanings underlying a natural lan guage. On the other hand, the polysemous meanings are derivative, being projected in regular and systematic ways by way of the analogy mechanisms, and so learnability is saved; the mechanisms must work upon a finite base, for all the familiar Davidsonian reasons. (This con stitutes a second argument for the existence of absolute meanings.) (D) and (E) are just false, however nice a world this would be if they were true. (F) is true in letter, but false as intended. Univocality is extremely rare if it exists at all, and the differences between the different types of equivocity are more interesting and important than is the difference between any of them and univocity. (G) is subject to the qualification noted in my comment on argument (v) above, and the "readings" associated with an ambiguous sentence would either have to abstract away from word meanings entirely or would be far more various than (G) allows. (H), of course, omits mention of the analogy mechanisms, and so is false as it stands, since the analogy mechanisms almost invariably figure in what we would unthinkingly have called the "literal" meanings of sentences. (J), finally, is immune to the analogy mechanisms themselves, so long as we are still withholding our assent to Ross' particular explication of dominance and his solipsistic view of word meaning. It is only if we were to agree on the latter that (J) would have to go. Thus there is not a lot left of Lexical Atomism, even though truth conditional semantics itself is still aloft. I take this to show that the two are largely independent, even though most truth-conditional theorists</page><page sequence="17">REVIEW 123 have tacitly accepted Atomism because they did not particularly care about lexical semantics. But the apparent falsity of (B) and (E), at least, should make semanticists take notice. NOTES See Davidson (1967), and the various essays collected in Davidson (1984); Hintikka (1969), and Montague (1974). 2 Cf. Weinreich (1971), Lyons (1977), Cohen (1985), and Davidson (1986). 3 It should be clear that Ross uses the word "context" to mean, not context of utterance in the more usual sense, but subsentential environment - the other word or phrase the given word is concatenated with. 4 Ross is fond of insisting that his explanations are causal explanations in as robust a sense of causality as one likes (e.g., pp. 5, 49, 53; this provocative claim is the final flourish on what I shall be calling his anti-intentionalism - see below). Some readers will find this silly; I rather like it. ' Some of the flavor will be conveyed if I quote just the definition of dominance itself: F dominates T' in C' (in E): (a) if a given term, t, is indifferent, apart from context, to a number of schemes, and (b) if a given frame expression, F (for the sentence C1 in E that contains t) is semantically (syntagmatically) resistant to (Def. 111-12) some members of some of the schemes for t, then F dominates the scheme-indifferent t by restricting t's range of schemes for the given context to schemes all of whose members are co applicable (Def. III-9) with F (if there are any). Portraying Analogy will never be accused of frivolousness. 6 The notion is cognate with what some theorists have called a "lexical field". 7 Of all the classical figures of speech, Ross argues later on (p. 152), only personification strictly requires metaphor. s These echo two objections I made in Lycan (1984) against the application of Putnamian "methodological solipsism" to linguistic semantics.
