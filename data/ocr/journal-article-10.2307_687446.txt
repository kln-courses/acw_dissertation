Sci. 34 (1983), 133-148 Printed in Great Britain 133 Explanatory Kinds* by MARK PLATTS I When considering the notions of a natural kind word and of a natural kind, confusion can be reduced by distinguishing two questions which arise for any given kind word. Is it treated as a natural kind word within a given linguistic community? And is its extension the actual membership of some natural kind? If we accept the terminological stipulation that for a term to be a natural kind word it is at least necessary that the term be treated as a natural kind word and that its extension constitute the actual membership of some natural kind,1 then it must seem that the latter condition carries the main burden. Whatever account be given of what it is to treat an expression as a natural kind word, it seems that any such account must aim to capture the idea that usage of the expression concerned manifests the supposition that the extension of the expression does indeed constitute the actual member- ship of a natural kind. Elucidation of the content of this supposition requires consideration of what it is for some class of objects to constitute the actual membership of a natural kind. Hilary Putnam tells us: 'Meta-science is today in its infancy: and terms like "natural kind" and "normal member" are in the same boat as the more familiar meta-scientific terms "theory" and "explanation" as far as resisting a speedy and definitive analysis is concerned' ([1975], p. 141). I think this co-occupancy no accident; seeing this may edge this part of 'meta-science' in the direction of its childhood. In trying to locate 'natural kind' within this 'meta-scientific' boat, I shall treat the other occupants as if they were unproblematic. That, of course, is not the case. But those with the conviction that the boat is leaky, or even those convinced that it has foundered, may find some interest in a charting of its occupancy. When is it that a class of objects constitutes the actual membership of a natural kind? As good a place as any to enter into this is provided by Putnam's remarks about water. He claims that to be water 'is to bear the relation sameL to certain things' (op. cit., p. 238). That claim is further Received 24 November 1981 * I am greatly indebted for their comments upon an ancestor of the present paper to John McDowell, Paul Snowdon, and David Wiggins. It is not mere form to stress that this does not mean them to be in agreement with what is said here (the induction that one of them will not be is overwhelming). 1 Only at least, since some might hold it also necessary, for example, that community-wide beliefs of speakers about the nature of (at least part of) the actual membership of the kind should fit, at least roughly, the real nature of those members.</page><page sequence="2">134 Mark Platts elaborated thus: ... 'water' is stuff that bears a certain similarity relation to the water around here. Water at another time or in another place or even in another possible world has to bear the relation sameL to our 'water' in order to be water (op. cit., p. 234). x bears the relation sameL to y just in case (i) x and y are both liquids, and (2) x and y agree in important physical properties (op. cit., pp. 238-9). To allow for water's frozen and gaseous states, Putnam's first condition, (i), upon the sameL relation should presumably be modified to talk of the normal instances, the 'normal members', of x and y both being liquids. A number of other questions invited by these passages will be considered later; but one question cannot now be sidestepped. For what are the important physical properties important? Consider the following claims made by David Wiggins: x is an f (horse, cypress-tree, orange, caddis-fly, . . .) if, and only if, given good exemplars of the kind ..., the most explanatory and comprehensive true theoretical description of the kind that the exemplars exemplify would group x alongside those exemplars ([1980], pp. 78-80). . it is a condition of the very existence of fs, so defined, that certain lawlike sentences should hold true. ... [T]hese lawlike sentences ... must determine directly or indirectly, in ways that we can uncover by empirical discovery, the characteristic development, the typical history, and the limits of any possible development or history of any compliant of [the particular natural kind concept f] (op. cit., p. 84). What the lawlike sentences aboutfs are equipped to do, that is, is to figure in correct law-based explanation of 'the characteristic development', etc., offs. '[L]awlike principles, known or unknown, . . . collect together [the] actual extension' (op. cit., p. 8o) of the natural kind offs in virtue of the potential role of lawlike principles about fs in explaining, in law-based ways, 'the characteristic development', etc., of the actual fs. So the 'important physical properties' spoken of by Putnam are those important for explanatory purposes. They are those properties the predi- cates "corresponding" to which will figure in true lawlike sentences to be used in correct explanation, of law-based kind, of the natures of the members of the kind concerned. Hence the rough initial idea is that what is involved in a class being a natural kind class is that there be explanations, of law-based kind, which serve to account for the nature of each member of that class but which do not so serve for any other object. The task now is to illuminate and refine this idea. 2 A class of objects existing in this world is the actual membership of the natural kind / only if a correct answer to the question 'what are these?' asked of the members of that class is '4s'. Truth here does not suffice for correctness. Rather, the answer '4s' is correct if, and only if, it is potentially a sufficiently explanatory characterisation of the members of that class, where this explanatory potential stems from law-based explanations of the properties of the members of that class which could truly be given. That purports to give only a necessary condition of being the actual</page><page sequence="3">Explanatory Kinds 135 membership of a given natural kind; nothing is yet explicitly said about how to fill out to the total actual membership of the kind. The condition given does not discriminate between total natural kind classes and sub-classes of them. A simple example of how the condition is meant to work might reduce its obscurity. The class of actual tigers is the actual membership of the natural kind tiger because, when asked 'what are these?' of the members of that class, the answer 'tigers' serves potentially to explain sufficiently what those objects are, their properties and their doings, by drawing upon the law- based explanatory credit to be met by the discovery of the true tiger-theory. That theory, when discovered, will serve through its constituent laws to account in the appropriate way for sufficient of those properties and doings. Whereas if asked 'what are these?' of the actual pencils in the world, the answer 'pencils', albeit true, is not correct in the sense required. Perhaps that answer serves, in conjunction with other information, to "explain" some properties of the actual pencils: it might, for example, serve in conjunction with truths about the human hand to "explain" the charac- teristic size and shape of pencils. But at the very least very many of the properties of pencils are left unexplained by the answer; and such "explanation" as is provided is not of a law-based kind. Much the same seems true of the answer 'tigers' to our question asked of the actual tigers; but the crucial difference lies in the availability of a theory of the items concerned which will meet the law-based explanatory credit being drawn upon in the answer to our question. The talk of 'tigers' being potentially a sufficiently explanatory characterisation of the actual tigers amounts to this: when the true tiger-theory, with its constituent laws, is known, then to say 'these are tigers' of the actual tigers will serve to explain, in a law-based way, sufficient of their properties and doings. Prior to knowing that theory, the claim that the objects concerned are tigers does not strictly explain anything: this is most obvious when we have either a radically mistaken tiger-theory or no such theory at all. Yet we can have, and indeed do have, good reason to believe that there could be a true tiger-theory prior to knowing what that theory is. By contrast, we neither have nor expect to have anything like a discovered theory of pencils; and that, we take it, reflects something about pencils, not something about our epistemic incapacities. We do not believe, and have every reason not to believe, that there are lawlike principles about pencils yet to be discovered, which principles will serve in law-based explanations of their properties. Natural kind classifications are explanatorily promissory notes to be met, if at all, by empirical investigation of the natural world. That thought is quite compatible with recognition of the possibility that nature might fail to meet our drawings. 3 Further refinement is introduced if we consider an obvious enough feature of at least most natural kind classifications. Obvious as the feature is,</page><page sequence="4">136 Mark Platts it is difficult to state with any combination of precision and plausibility quite what the theoretical limitations are upon the forms which that feature can take.1 Let us therefore focus upon a simple example of the feature. The class of lemons in this world is the actual membership of a natural kind. But that class also forms part of the actual membership of the 'higher level' natural kind of citrus fruits. Similarly, the actual membership of that higher level kind is part of the actual membership of the still higher level kind of fruits. Citrus fruit is a higher level natural kind than lemon but a lower level natural kind than fruit. Why do the lemons of this world constitute the total actual membership of the natural kind lemon rather than merely part of the actual membership of the natural kindfruit? Or why do the fruits of this world constitute the actual membership of the natural kind fruit rather than merely being the ("non- natural") union of the membership of the natural kinds citrus fruit and soft fruit? Suppose that, starting from 'given good exemplars' of each of the putative natural kinds fruit, citrus fruit, and lemon, we investigate the 'important physical properties' of the respective exemplars-say, their chromosome structures. We discover some general chrososome structure in all exemplars of the kind fruit; this general structure occurs in the exemplars of the kind citrus fruit and in the exemplars of the kind lemon. But we also discover some more specific chromosome structure in our exemplars of the kind citrus fruit, which structure serves to distinguish them from such exemplars as we have, encounter, or imagine, of the kind soft fruit. This more specific chromosome structure occurs in our exemplars of the kind lemon; but in those exemplars we also find some even more specific chromosome structure which serves to distinguish them from such exemplars as we have of other kinds of citrus fruits, such as limes. (That we have antecedently distinguished citrus fruits from soft fruits, or lemons from limes, is not essential here.) Consider a group of objects which are all in fact citrus fruits. We might set out to explain their properties, both obvious and non-obvious, by reliance just upon the truths discovered about the chromosome structure of fruits in general together with other collateral information about their environments and so on. Such a pattern of explanation allowing of variation in collateral information would have to a significant degree the epistemically important virtue of wide generality of range: the same pattern of explanation with variation of collateral input could be used in accounting for the properties of a wide range of objects-viz,. all fruits. But suppose that our concern is with explanation of the properties of the particular group of objects which are all in fact citrus fruits. Or suppose that we are led to that concern by our discoveries. We might then employ a pattern of explanation which draws upon the discovered, more specific, chromosome structure of citrus fruits, 1 See, e.g., R. Thomason [1969], Howard Kahane [1969], Wiggins, op. cit., pp. 2o01-4.</page><page sequence="5">Explanatory Kinds 137 along with the believed collateral truths about the histories, environments, etc., of the objects concerned. Allowing variation in the collateral inputs, the pattern of explanation then being employed still has a wide explanatory range-viz,. all citrus fruits. But the explanatory range is less than that in the case of the first, "fruit-based", pattern of explanation: for not all fruits are citrus fruits. However, this narrowing of potential explanatory range in our new, "citrus fruit-based", pattern of explanation is compensated for by an appreciable increase in the potential explanatory power of that pattern of explanation: reliance upon the discovery of the more specific chromosome structure of citrus fruits enables us to explain more about the items in the group concerned and more about the items in the, admittedly reduced, potential range of our pattern of explanation. The narrowing of the potential explanatory range of the pattern of explanation is accompanied by a sufficient increase in its explanatory power. Just the same is true of explanations grounded in the discovered distinctive chromosome structure of lemons. Employment of explanations so grounded will in fact reduce the potential range of the pattern of explanation invoked-not all citrus fruits, let alone all fruits, are lemons. Yet such a reduction in potential range is compensated for by a (discovered) sufficient increase in the explanatory power of the account then proffered: we are equipped to explain-still in a general, albeit range-reduced, way-more of the properties of the lemons encountered. (It is not essential for this point that we actually know of the existence of citrus fruits of kinds other than lemons; theoretical considerations could lead us to distinguish the more general chromosome structure of citrus fruits from the more specific chromosome structure of lemons. We could be led to consider the possibility of there being citrus fruits other than lemons without knowing whether that possibility is realised.) The point of distinguishing lemons as a natural kind, or of distinguishing fruits as a natural kind, is thus readily understood if natural kind classifications are closely connected to explanation. My discussion has relied upon two general desiderata in explanations--the maximisation of potential range and the maximisation of potential power-and shown how, in conjunction with our initial idea, the tension between these desiderata will lead us to distinguish different levels of natural kinds. 4 Suppose we are given what we take to be 'good exemplars' of some presumed natural kind 0. On investigation we discover there to be three different "explanatory structures" within different members of our group of 'good exemplars'. Have we discovered that there is no natural kind 4? Or that our set of 'good exemplars' was not so good, that it included some non- / s, such that only one of the discovered explanatory structures is that distinctive of 4s? Or-the possibility we have just been led to appreciate- that 4s are a higher level natural kind with at least three lower level natural kinds standing to the kind 4 in the relation species to genus? (The second and K</page><page sequence="6">138 Mark Platts third options would be combined if it were held that only two of the three discovered structures served to distinguish species of Os.) Putnam discusses 'the case of jade', of which he says: Although the Chinese do not recognise a difference, the term 'jade' applies to two minerals: jadeite and nephrite. Chemically, there is a marked difference. Jadeite is a combination of sodium and aluminium. Nephrite is made of calcium, magnesium and iron. These two quite different microstructures produce the same unique textural qualities! (Putnain [19751], P. 24). And from the following paragraph it seems that Putnam wishes to hold that there are two kinds of 'jade', and that jadeite is but one (jadeite) kind of jade. Is jade a natural kind in the light of these discoveries? Whatever Putnam's final view of the matter might be, it seems to me clear that we should not hold it to have been discovered that jade is a higher level natural kind with each of jadeite and nephrite standing to it in the relation species to genus. If we consider the law-based explanations which will be given, in the light of this and other collateral discoveries, of for example the (similar) textural qualities of jadeite and nephrite, it is clear that those explanations will make no reference to any structure common to jadeite and nephrite which would serve to distinguish the "natural kind" of jade from that of, say, inorganic chemical compound. The different species of genuine higher level natural kinds-acids, metals, and fruits, for example-by contrast do share common explanatory properties which serve to distinguish these higher level kinds from yet higher ones. Any specimen of jade, like any pencil or paddle- steamer, is within the natural wvorld, of course; hence any such item is a reasonable object of law-based explanation in terms of some laws true of that world. But it does not follow that, and indeed is discovered to be false that, there are laws about jade or about pencils or about paddle-steamers 'as such', as Wiggins would put it. The laws which can be used in explanation of the properties of these items have been discovered to be inadequate for distinguishing the "natural kind" of jade (or of pencils or of paddle- steamers) from far higher, more embracing natural kinds. The location of a given natural kind within a natural ordering of natural kinds-within a 'family' or 'tree' of natural kinds-can be a matter for a posteriori discovery. Both, so to say, the branch of the ordering within which the natural kind is placed and the level it occupies within that branch can be determined by empirical investigation. It could have turned out that jade was indeed a natural kind but one which fell within the organic compound branch of the chemical tree. Or it could have turned out that while both kinds of jade were (as they are) inorganic chemical compounds with distinct chemical structures, yet that those distinct chemical structures shared (as they do not) important chemically explanatory structures which served to distinguish jade as a natural kind from higher level kinds on the same branch. In such a case we should have discovered that jade was indeed a natural kind, albeit one of a higher level than the kinds of jadeite and nephrite and albeit one of a higher level than we perhaps initially suspected.</page><page sequence="7">Explanatory Kinds I39 That point is important for philosophical usage of the notion of a natural kind. A form of argument commonly encountered in recent philosophical writings seeks to establish that some class of phenomena-say, that of seeings or that of rememberings--is not the membership of any natural kind by invoking the fact that within the membership of that class we find a variability in the "structural realisations" of those members. But that does not establish the presumed conclusion. The possibility remains open that the class of phenomena concerned is the membership of some higher level natural kind, a kind which allows of ("species-specific") variation within the, say, physical structures that "realise" the higher level kind as between lower level varieties of that kind. Note that it is not essential for this possibility that it be possible to determine lower level natural kinds, species, of the "higher level" natural kind. 5 A worry might arise about Putnam's gloss upon the sameL relation in the context of his use of that relation in accounting for what it is to be water. Suppose it is a fact that any two liquids, not just any two liquid samples of water, 'agree in important physical properties'. (That is a fact if liquid is a natural kind.) Then how has Putnam given an account of what it is to be water rather than an account of what it is to be a liquid? The same worry arises for Wiggins' talk of 'collecting together' the extension of a natural kind 'around an arbitrary good representative of its extension': for 'an arbitrary good representative' of the natural kind water is also 'an arbitrary good representative' of any higher level natural kind under which water falls. There are two questions here. First, what is the point of our being able to 'collect together' around the samples either the extension of a higher level natural kind-say, liquid-by reference to more general 'important physical properties' of the samples or the extension of a lower level natural kind- water-by reference to more specific 'important physical properties' of the samples even while recognising their more general 'important physical properties'? How can it be reasonable that we have both options? That question has already been answered through the consideration of general desiderata in explanations. But a second question has not yet been answered: how is it determined in any particular case which option is pursued? How is it determined, for example, that from 'an arbitrary good representative' of the kind water an investigator intends to 'collect together' the extension of that kind rather than that of some appropriate higher level kind like liquid? And how is it determined that a language-acquiring child move from an acquaintance with 'an arbitrary good representative' of the kind lemon demonstrated to him as 'lemons' to the ability to use in a (roughly) correct way the term 'lemon' rather than to the "ability" to call all citrus fruits 'lemons'? (It is a good question how similar the two cases-that of the investigator and that of the child-are.) It may partly have been through consideration of such questions that</page><page sequence="8">I40 Mark Platts Putnam was led to his great attachment to the notion of the stereotype of a given natural kind: roughly, the notion of some favoured description of more or less obvious and striking features of the 'normal members' of the kind. Putnam holds that it is not, in general, enough for acquisition of roughly correct usage of a natural kind word that one be acquainted with even some 'normal' part of its extension as part of its extension; one has also, in general, to latch onto the stereotypical description of members of that kind. A possible rationale for maintaining this might be the thought that the acquired stereotypical description will serve to narrow (or to expand) one's focus when considering how to fill out the extension of the kind from the samples given.I Concession of the claim that knowledge of some stereotypical description often serves this purpose does not support any of Putnam's other claims as to the semantic importance of the notion of a stereotype.2 But it anyway seems that no such claim could provide a completely general answer to our questions since, as Putnam himself stresses, the strength and uniformity of associated stereotypical descriptions vary greatly for different natural kind words. Another worry is that there seems nothing impossible about a given natural kind word and its immediately higher, "embracing", natural kind word sharing the same stereotypical description. Were this possibility to be realised, empirical investigation could determine whether those who use the classification have some propensity to continue employing that classification in such a way as, say, to maximise its explanatory power (in the sense earlier specified). 6 Putnam has defended the view that explanation is an interest-relative notion.3 His idea, briefly, is this: apart from various familiar formal considerations, there are other, pragmatic considerations which bear upon the worth of an explanation. A good explanation will not 'generalise to an "uninteresting" class of cases' only; nor will it 'simply give back what we already know'; and, most generally and most importantly, a good expla- nation will 'fit the explanation space', the ' "space" of relevant alternatives', presupposed by the particular pursuit of explanation in virtue of the 'range of interests' which motivate that pursuit. So what will count for a given scientist as a good explanation of some phenomenon will depend upon the constraints which he, perhaps tacitly, places upon the terms of any putative explanation, such constraints reflecting the 'range of interests' underlying his concern for an explanation in the first place. That 'range of interests' will I am indebted here to the late Dr David Pole. 2 Cp. my [1980]. 3 See his [1978], pp. 41-5; see also Alan Garfinkel [1981]. I should perhaps express my recognition of the fact that, unlike the other doctrines in the philosophy of science which I take over without argument in this paper for purposes of charting the occupancy of the 'meta- scientific' boat, the doctrine that explanation is an interest-relative notion has little claim to yet being an orthodoxy.</page><page sequence="9">Explanatory Kinds 141 connect with the kind of scientist he is; it will also connect with his singling out of, and his way of singling out, the phenomenon to be explained. Now, several critics of diverse aspects of Putnam's discussion of natural kinds and natural kind words have seized upon the cases of elements which have isotopes.1 An element is identified by its atomic number, which records the particular number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom of that element. The isotopes of a given element are identified by their isotope numbers, such a number recording for any particular isotope of an element the combined number of protons and neutrons found in the nucleus of an atom of that isotope.2 One element can have several different isotopes. Protium, deuterium, and tritium are, for example, three known isotopes of hydrogen, while in an historically important case chlorine was found to have two isotopes. In a recent paper Hugh Mellor writes (op. cit., p. 303): If Zemach's ... heavy waters are too rare and exotic to convince, try the two common isotopes of chlorine. ... It is ... undeniable that the extension of "chlorine" included both isotopes before their discovery, and so presumably includes both isotopes now. What Putnam must say is that chlorine and water have been found not to be natural kinds after all, but rather mixtures of natural kinds. But in that case, as Zemach ... observes, it will very likely turn out that we have no natural kind terms. Mellor makes these remarks in the context of defending some supposedly Fregean principle to the effect that the extension of any term is some kind of function of its users' beliefs. That is not our concern here; but we need now to be clear upon the falsity of one of Mellor's claims. Nobody should deny that the isotope number of an isotope of an element records a feature which may be of great importance for understanding various of that isotope's properties. Some isotopes of a given element may be radioactive while others are not; some isotopes of a given element may be unstable and may break down into isotopes of other elements while other isotopes of the same element are not and do not. One whose interests direct him to the pursuit of explanations of such properties will need to distinguish between the isotopes of some given element. At least many kinds of physicists will thus be led to make the finer, isotopic distinctions within their classification. But it simply does not follow that, for such physicists, 'chlorine ... [has] been found not to be [a natural kind] after all, but rather [a 1 See, e.g., Eddy M. Zemach [1976]; D. H. Mellor [19771, pp. 299-312; and the papers by Keith Donnellan and Dudley Shapere presented at a conference organised by the National Autonomous University of Mexico held in Queretaro, Mexico, in 1980, to be published in the proceedings of that conference. See also the comments made in reply to Mellor by Wiggins, op. cit., pp. 210-13. It should be stressed here that my concern in this paper is not with the relations between natural kind classifications as they occur in science and as they occur in the vernacular, but merely with understanding the former. 2 In fact it is the combination of atomic number and isotope number that is important for the identification of isotopes, but that need not delay us here.</page><page sequence="10">142 Mark Platts mixture] of natural kinds'. The possibility remains open that chlorine has been found to be a higher level natural kind relative to its isotopes. All that is needed for that to be defensible is that the isotopes of a given element share some property-plausibly, that recorded by the atomic number of the element--which is discovered both to serve to distinguish that kind from yet higher level kinds and also to be of importance for explanation of relevant kinds of physical properties, where relevance is determined by the interests of the investigators. In the simplest case, reference to that general property will be an essential common component of each of the explanations of the particular distinctive properties of isotopes which first led the investigator to distinguish those isotopes; but there are other, less simple, cases in which the investigator will be led, non-arbitrarily, to recognise the higher level, elemental kind. Whatever the rights or wrongs of defending this possibilityas regards chlorine may turn out to be in the light of future findings, such a defence in the present state of our knowledge is utterly distinct as regards plausibility from a similar view of 'the case of jade'. Putnam's perhaps erroneous description of that case should not be allowed to mask this obvious truth. Given the interests which initially fix the 'explanation space' of the chemist, he may find no need to follow the (relevant kind of) physicist in distinguishing the isotopes of elements: for 'what is fundamental in the explanation of chemical reactions . . . is the electron shell, and the atomic number' (Wiggins, op. cit., p. 212). But this is not an a priori claim about the chemically fundamental. Whether a disregard of some finer system of classification is reasonable or not turns upon both the nature of the chemist's initial 'explanation space' and empirical discoveries about the terms needed for explanation of the phenomena singled out by the interests which initially structure that space. It could turn out that explanations of chemical reactions require recourse to the isotopic classification. Discovery can further shape the explanation space. Indeed nothing rules out a priori the possibility that the phenomena picked out by some set of interests not be explicable in terms even remotely concordant with the explanation space initially determined by those interests. If this possibility is discovered to be actually realised, two options arise. One is abandonment of study of the subject-matter distinguished by those interests, at least in the way of a scientific, law-based explanatory discipline. The other is complete abandonment of the explanation space initially relied upon, and its replacement by some other explanation space for which the general a priori possibility is discovered not to be realised. Nothing guarantees that this second option is always open to us; for nothing guarantees that every interesting subject-matter be amenable to scientific explanatory treatment. Status as an a priori truth is not secured for the claim that any interesting scheme of classification reflects some natural order of things by penning in the condition that the classification first be of interest to a scientist (in his scientific moments).</page><page sequence="11">Explanatory Kinds 143 7 We can now fence off some of the pitfalls which might be occasioned by Putnam's talk of 'important physical properties' in his discussion of what it is to be water. If the word 'physical' invites either the thought that any defensible natural kind classification can issue only from investigations shaped by "the" interests of physicists or the thought that any such classification can receive adequate elucidation only in "the" terms of the physicist, then the invitation should be declined. We lack reason to believe that interests, other than those of the physicist, which might shape patterns of explanatory enquiry and issue in explanatory groupings of phenomena will be satisfied by the explanatory classifications which the physicist's investigations issue in. We even lack any a priori reason for holding that the groupings of natural phenomena which these other investigations issue in will correspond in even rough ways to distinctive compounds of groupings recognised within the physicist's classification. Maybe the possibility of some "physicalistic reduction" is a pre-condition of the naturalness of any kind classification; but persistent failure of attempts at such reduction, and consequent acceptance of the non- realisation in this world of that possibility, would not banish the classifi- cation concerned to the realm of the artificial. Saying that does not, of course, imply there to be no sense in which natural kind classifications-indeed, all kind classifications--are of only "physi- cal" phenomena. Resignation to failures of physicalistic reduction need occasion no attachment to an ontological pluralism concerning the stuff of the world. 8 When considering John Locke's talk of 'our ideas of substances', no injustice is done by taking him as talking of our 'ideas' of natural kinds. Locke held in effect that a natural kind classification results from investi- gations prompted by the desire 'to copy things as they really do exist, and to represent to ourselves that constitution on which all their properties de- pend .. .'.1 William Whewell said that when botanists seek for a natural classification of plants, what they seek for is 'not of their own creation; not anything merely conventional or systematic; but something which they conceive to exist in the relations of the plants themselves; something which is without the mind, not within; in nature, not in art; in short a natural order'.2 Mill claimed, when due allowance is made for change of termin- ology, that a natural kind classification 'is made by nature', whereas an artificial kind classification is made 'by us for our convenience'.3 And more recently, Pierre Duhem held that a zoologist seeks for a system of classification of animals whose relations 'correspond to real relations among the associated creatures brought together and embodied in his abstractions'.4 1 An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, bk. II, ch. XXXI, 3; see also bk. III, ch. VI. 2 The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, vol. I. 3 A System of Login, bk. I, ch. VII. 4 [1962], p. 25.</page><page sequence="12">144 Mark Platts Despite important differences of interest and of view, the potential agreement amongst these philosophers is striking. A natural kind classifi- cation, while an abstraction created in our minds, yet is made for and through investigation of nature. The ordering embodied in such a classifi- cation is supposed to copy, to correspond to, some order in nature, some order conceived of as existing without-outside of-the mind. When some group of objects is brought together by being seen as the membership of some kind, this grouping is not supposed to be merely conventional, merely a matter of convenience, precisely because of the supposition of the possibility of a discovered representation of the shared constitution, the shared real relations, upon which the properties of the objects so grouped depend. The abstract divisions employed within a natural kind classifi- cation; the beliefs about the actual membership of a given kind; the representations of the distinctive constitutions shared by the members of the kinds; all are subject to the results of investigation of nature. Locke's use of the word 'depend' is, it seems, meant to mark some real relation without the mind between the constitution of a substance and 'all' of its properties. Now, my account of natural kinds has been explicitly cast in terms of the notion of explanation; and 'explains', if a relation at all, is a relation between sets of sentences. The adequacy of an explanation can be eliminated by substitution within that explanation of co-extensive expres- sions; adequacy depends upon the terms within which an explanation is cast. Thus it might look as if the Lockean account of natural kinds in terms of "real dependence" and one in terms of explanation are distinct, perhaps even rivals; one taken by that appearance will ask how a decision between them is to be made. It is important to avoid a serious, and not uncommon, misunderstanding as to what is consequent upon an explanation-based account of natural kinds given familiar truths about the linguistic dependence of adequate expla- nation. Explanations aim to account for how things are, where how things are can be 'without the mind' in at least two senses: generally, the things to be accounted for are non-mental phenomena like earthquakes and chemical reactions; and, generally, things would have been how they are even if minds had never existed. It is also generally true that if an adequate explanation issues from investigation of how things are without the mind, that explanation would have been adequate even if no minds had existed to concoct it. Yet this last claim needs careful interpretation if it is not mistakenly to be thought incompatible with the linguistic dependence of adequate explanations. Suppose we discover some (believed) adequate explanation of an occur- rence 'without the mind' in this, the actual, world. We might then consider a world just like ours in including that occurrence 'without the mind' but which does not itself contain minds to come up with that explanation. Still, we can explain that occurrence in that possible world in exactly the same terms as those used in explaining the same occurrence in our, actual, world.</page><page sequence="13">Explanatory Kinds 145 Continuing in this (metaphysically dangerous) vein, we might consider another possible world, like ours in containing minds like ours but not containing the particular occurrence under consideration. If we consider the speculations of the minds in that world about the first possible world-the mindless one which does contain the occurrence-we can maintain, subject to interest-relativity, that the minds in the second envisaged world ought to come by the same explanation of the counterfactual-for-them occurrence as we do of the factual-for-us occurrence. There is no simple inevitable route from an explanation-based account of natural kinds to the thought that in every sense distinctions between natural kinds are merely 'within the mind'. It is no consequence of the explanation- based account that there was no real difference between, say, tapirs and giraffes prior to invention of a system of zoological classification which served to distinguish them; nor is it a consequence that there would be no such difference in a world free of minds like ours. Once that misunderstanding is avoided, the initial suspicion of an incompatibility between a Lockean account of natural kinds in terms of 'real dependence' and one in terms of 'explanatory dependence' is much reduced. Any residual suspicion of such rivalry can, I think, be eliminated by appreciation of the separability of the 'real dependence' account from its, historically speaking, near constant accompaniment by crude representative theories of perception and truth-a contingent accompaniment which received its sharpest exemplification in Mill's thought that a natural kind classification 'is made by nature' as opposed to being made 'by us for our convenience'. If we abandon those shady companions of the 'real depen- dence' account while avoiding the misunderstanding as to what is con- sequent upon an 'explanatory dependence' account, the way is open to contemplate the possibility that the appearance of even a contrast between those accounts is illusory. We are placed to entertain the thought that the two kinds of account are dependent one upon the other, a finally adequate account of either kind having inevitably to be shaped so as to be able to draw upon the other. I cannot attempt to consider fully that general thought here; all I shall do is examine one important aspect of this possible mutual dependence. Without denying the non-extensionality of 'explains', one can still entertain the thought that the explanations upon which some articulated natural kind classification is based work by tracing out relations of Lockean real dependence. Such a thought can seem close to unavoidable. Consider, for example, the modifications to be made to the earlier account (Section 2) of when it is that a class of objects is the actual membership of the natural kind 0 if the initial idea behind that account (Section i) is to be applied to as yet nameless natural kinds. The obvious modifications would yield some- thing like this: a class of objects is the actual membership of some natural kind only if there is, or it would be possible to introduce, a term 4 such that a correct answer to the question 'what are these?' asked of the members of that</page><page sequence="14">146 Mark Platts class is, or would be, 'Os'. Lest the idea of introducing a 'correct answer' to our question seems redolent of arbitrary invention, and having anyway been forced explicitly to introduce modal talk into our account, we might now try to clarify matters by making explicit another modal element implicit all along. Modifying slightly the notion of a correct answer, the final account is this: a class of objects existing in this world is the actual membership of some natural kind only if either there is a term 0 such that, if certain things were known, a correct answer to the question 'what are these?' asked of the members of that class would be 'Os', or it would be possible to introduce a term 4 such that, if certain things were known, a correct answer to the same question asked of the same objects would then be 'Os'. (Thus the account for nameless natural kinds, or for "non-naturally named" natural kinds, is doubly modal.) It is easy to feel that although this account may coincide with being the actual membership of some natural kind, yet it fails to capture explicitly the real essence of the matter. This feeling is perhaps sharper. for nameless natural kinds, but it can arise also for named kinds. Amongst the things which have to be known for 'Os' to count as a correct answer to the question 'what are these?', whether '0' was antecedently part of the language or not, are various laws about Os, which laws are to be invoked in explanations of the properties of the objects concerned. Suppose that laws are viewed as true sentences:' then there must be lawlike sentences about Os known to be true if '4s' is to count as a correct answer. But now, if we are to have sufficient grasp upon what it would be for the (disjunctive) necessary condition of actual membership of some natural kind presented in the final account to be satisfied, we need answers to some further questions. (Given the occurrence of terms of art here, any theorist of laws has considerable choice in the distribution of the substance of his theory between his answers to the questions.) First, what is it for a sentence to be a lawlike sentence? That question could be taken to request either some characterisation of the (presumed) general form of lawlike sentences or some account of what it is for a sentence to be treated as a law. Secondly, is it sufficient for a lawlike sentence's being a law that it be true? Thirdly, and connectedly, in virtue of what is a law true? This is scarcely the point to argue for answers to those questions. Still, maintaining a level of lofty abstraction, we can contemplate an ordering of theorists of laws upon a scale of metaphysical parsimony: the ordering is determined by the strength of the metaphysical demands which the theorists make, so to say, upon reality. (A distinct, albeit historically connected, ordering issues from consideration of the strength of the demands made by the theorists upon the knowing subject.) In the case of causal laws, for example, an extremely parsimonious view was given clear expression by F. P. Ramsey ([I981], p. 252): 1 The point of this section is independent of this particular supposition.</page><page sequence="15">Explanatory Kinds 147 The world, or rather that part of it with which we are acquainted, exhibits as we must all agree a good deal of regularity of succession. I contend that over and above that it exhibits no feature called causal necessity, but that we make sentences called causal laws from which (i.e. having made which) we proceed to actions and propositions connected with them in a certain way, and say that a fact asserted in a proposition which is an instance of a causal law is a case of causal necessity. Near the other limit we shall certainly find Leibniz (Gerhardt II, p. 263): Nothing is permanent in a substance except the law itself which determines the continuous succession of its states and accords within the individual substance with the laws of nature that govern the whole world. If retaining our earlier terminological stipulation whereby laws are true sentences, we might rewrite the last cited passage by substituting the Leibnizian phrase 'principle of activity' for the occurrences therein of 'law'. We can then sloganise a neo-Leibnizian view as follows: a law is true in virtue of its correspondence with some real principle of activity. There are countless other views located between those of Ramsey and Leibniz; of particular interest for an aficionado of contemporary philo- sophical literature will be the mounting grades of modal involvement encountered in the ordering when moving towards Leibniz's position. It is worthy of note that only at this late stage, with pressure applied to another occupant of the 'meta-scientific' boat, has the account of natural kinds developed here made direct contact with the much disputed matter of essentialism. Of more immediate relevance, we are now placed to appreciate in general terms the circumstances under which the appearance of a contrast between the "explanatory dependence" account of natural kinds and that in terms of "real dependence" would dissolve, at least for one beginning from the former. What is required for such a dissolution is that sufficient reason be given for holding that an adequate theory of laws must invoke and elucidate metaphysical materials sufficient for making sense of Lockean talk of real dependence. 9 Natural kind classifications within science are grounded in the investi- gation of nature, investigation carried out with an eye to providing law- invoking explanations of truths about the world around us. Yet it could be importantly misleading to say that natural kind classifications are 'made by nature' in the sense of simply copying, mirroring, or imitating some natural order of things, admittedly discovered, obtaining in the natural world. Such classifications reflect a feature of us-namely, our general interest in such law-based explanation. Moreover, there are diverse classifications, diverse orderings, which reflect various more specific kinds of interests of ours through the role of those interests in shaping the investigations which, the world being willing, issue in those orderings. Doubtless those interests are determined in part by the outcome of previous attempts to understand, through investigation, the natural world. And it is of course essential for</page><page sequence="16">148 Mark Platts understanding the distinction between natural and artificial kinds to recognise the distinctive role of investigation of the world in the formation of views as to the natures of, and memberships of, natural kinds. Yet it remains true that our natural kind classifications are as interestingly informative about ourselves as about the natural orders of things. The inadequacies of any general exclusive distinction between the real and the anthropomorphic here come readily to the open eye.
