<plain_text><page sequence="1">Without Fooling the Bird: Structural Anthropology and the "Naturalist" Music of R-B. M?che Andrew Infanti Pouvoir marcher, sans tromper l'oiseau, du coeur de l'arbre ? l'extase du fruit. ?Ren? Char Music has long existed in a queasy relation to its purported origins in nature. Most would agree it is a strictly human concep tion. Yet, independent of man's creations, the world is full of sounds that offer themselves as models for emulation. The strong conventionality of most musical systems encourages them to sidestep this issue in favor of purely formal concerns, allowing only the liminal "poetic" content of music to give a nod towards an idealized nature through imitations of pleasing natural sounds: the rushing of the breeze, the babbling of a brook, the benign chirping of birds.</page><page sequence="2">Without Fooling the Bird 5 What would it actually mean to accept a natural parentage of music and to take seriously the sounds of the biosphere and the elements, to use them in their raw form to create art? For French composer and aesthetic theorist Fran?ois-Bernard M?che, sound artists have been deterred from this very project by the problematics in the concept "natural" and by the implicit stigma placed on representative or imitative musics. M?che declares a resolute faith in "natural" music: "Music exists in nature, we musicians are just barely intermediaries; we collect it and tran scribe it."1 In order to clarify his definition of nature, he sketches a his tory of the basic quandary surrounding it: What one called 'nature' in Rameau's time was a rationality present in the world. In the twentieth century, we have a tendency to use the notion of nature in the opposite sense: the abundance of the real which escapes preexisting frameworks.2 His own working definition of natural is admittedly indebted to phenomenology and the tenets of musique concr?te-} I mean [by the natural and the real] first the relation between my senses and what there is around me. I mean the acoustic world in general, including that which is man-made. It's 'natural' in the sense that it's a 'given'?whether it be birdsongs, the noise of the ocean, or those of machines. One receives them and creates acoustic objects through the relation between what is given and consciousness.4 In M?che 's work, the practice of imitation itself may function as a bridge between the consciousness of an individual or culture and the otherness of nature. Regarding imitation as an epistemological device, M?che 's attitude is considerably more pointed. He does not attribute a human primacy to this ability to imitate: "This practice of imitation ... is not especially a creation of human intelligence but a trait widespread among different liv ing species."5 He goes on to polemicize the abstract nature of music, insisting that it in fact began in imitation. He is interested in exposing the debt of "pure" music to a figurative type imitation. Yet, in this step he refuses to grant superior aesthetic status ipso facto to either programme music or abstract music: A large part of music from Europe and the rest of the world is actu ally figurative, to various degrees, and when it ends up obliterating reference, it is through a movement of abstraction which is far from</page><page sequence="3">6 Perspectives of New Music being the only basis of musical practice. Abstraction is probably the end rather than the beginning of music. . . . From imitative magic to pure numerical combinations, all the degrees of abstraction are rep resented, without ever guaranteeing or excluding the quality of a work.6 M?che's music often requires both the composer and performer to engage in a set of different games of imitation. His 1972 work Korwar, for harpsichord and tape, demands transcription or improvisation in the style of at least seven different animal species and the "random" sounds of falling rain. M?che's decision to use unmanipulated animal and ele mental sounds in his work inevitably places him in a line not only "natu ralist" but even "primitive," an attitude he does not seem to reject. He writes: The apparent gratuitousness, indeed uselessness of music has long been interpreted as the sign of its pure conventionality. It seems more likely and less sterile to consider it as a primary urge, as the eruption of a primitive thought in the heart of all cultures.7 This reference to a mythic mind frame, indeed a pens?e sauvage, begins to suggest an overlapping of his aesthetic concerns with a larger intellec tual movement in France, structural anthropology, which gave a new and probing look at what were previously dismissed as primitive ineptitudes: myths and totems. People in non-industrialized societies, having much more empirical contact with the animal kingdom and the natural world, have often used animal or half-human figures in their myth and art, stressing the fluidity and even historicity of the relation between "natural" and "cultural" realms. Such animal and natural presence in "primitive" art and magic often caused it to be prejudicially set apart from "civilized" work as crude, tentative, and subservient to the fear and necessity which nature supposedly symbolized to these cultures. It was the structural anthropol ogy of Claude L?vi-Strauss which most strongly reinvestigated these expressions as rigorous ways of thinking. The interplay between M?che's work and the French intellectual cur rents contemporary with it requires some clarification. Most notably, a contrast must be made between the purely aesthetic positions of M?che and those of structural anthropology's greatest proponent, L?vi-Strauss. A striking resonance between their works and the various political goals implicit in them persists despite the very articulate and opposing positions each maintain.</page><page sequence="4">Without rooling the Bird 7 French intellectual star Claude L?vi-Strauss seemed to dismiss himself from any progressive discussion of contemporary music after condemn ing, in Le Cru et le cuit, the aesthetics of both serial music8 and musique concr?te9 at the height of their renowrn. The man who wielded so much intellectual influence in 1960's France thus firmly repudiated the artistic merits of these two warring camps which fought to represent French musical culture. Yet, in spite of presenting himself as a guardian of con servative tastes, his ethnographic work did not fail to fascinate a genera tion of thinkers and artists in France. It is possible that some ideas of L?vi-Strauss the anthropologist have closely paralleled achievements in musical art which L?vi-Strauss the aesthetic theorist would simply not tolerate, namely those of F.-B. M?che. Rather than teasing out the contradictions in L?vi-Straussian aesthet ics, I intend to examine the importance his work on mythology and primitive culture had on a French "naturalist" music. This music's form and function arise in a polemical relation to L?vi-Strauss's work. His anthropological writings often court the boundary between nature and culture?a line he considers formative in nearly all civilizations. Naturalist music positions itself along this frontier striving to create an art using only natural sounds and their imitation. L?vi-Strauss clearly rejects such a practice, insisting on the cultural origin of musical sounds and the non imitative basis of musical thought. He writes, It is sometimes said that music is not normally imitative or, more accurately, that it never imitates anything but itself. . . . There are no musical sounds in nature, except in a purely accidental and unstable way; there are only noises. . . . The so-called songs of birds are on the frontiers of language; their purpose is to express and communi cate. Therefore it is still true that musical sounds are part of culture. However, the dividing line between culture and nature is not identi cal, as used to be thought, with any of the lines of demarcation between human and animal nature.10 For L?vi-Strauss, music must be self-similar and fall within cultural boundaries, even though he is willing to move these limits toward the animal kingdom as necessary In this latter minute point we can sense a burgeoning concordance between L?vi-Strauss and M?che. In the analysis that follows, I risk falsifying L?vi-Strauss's position by ignoring his plentiful aesthetic rants, but I find this suppressive maneuver tantamount to a fruitful inquiry. Likewise, Mache's copious writings will be used at an unfair minimum only to clarify his goals for the specific work in question. If the reader imagines only bitter controversy in the</page><page sequence="5">8 Perspectives of New Music coupling of these two seemingly incongruous thinkers, I remind him/her of L?vi-Strauss's famous use of binary oppositions to solve cultural and mythological queries. In historical perspective, several peaks of French naturalist music arise at either end of Levi-Strauss's long intellectual hegemony in France. In 1955, L?vi-Strauss released his first work to reach a broad public, Tristes Tropiques; early in 1956, Parisian audiences heard Olivier Messiaen's Oiseaux exotiques. The year 1958 marks both the publication of Anthro pologie structurale and the completion of Messiaen's vast Catalogue A'oiseaux piano cycle. At the opposite end of Levi-Strauss's career we have the publication in 1972 of the final volume (VHomme nu) of his exhaustive series Mythologiques. This very year shares the premiere of F.-B. M?che's Korwar, for harpsichord and taped sounds, which provides the focal topic of this paper. I intend to look at Korwar and its multiple imitation strategies in two L?vi-Straussian ways: as a totem and inciden tally as a social critique.11 The very title of L?vi-Strauss's book The Raw and the Cooked renders a clear summary of his most celebrated binary relation mythically opposing nature and culture. For L?vi-Strauss, dual organizations are not innate to human thought, nor representative of its complexity, but suggest a reason ing system which allows mediation between poles that may be binary or multiple themselves. The fact of grouping elements into these binaries does not interest him perse. Instead, he analyzes closely the structure of the rela tion between one binary and others. Thus, he postulates myth as a system of thought historically related to the crossing of the barrier from nature to culture, when the elements separating them were not so distinct. M?che presents the aesthetic project for his work Korwar as "confusing the bor derline between nature and culture in order to suggest a counterculture which returns through play all the weapons the human mind has given itself. . . against serious officialdom [academicism]."12 Korwar instantly yields to a plethora of arbitrary binaries that may help us classify the piece. It pits a live performer against a prerecorded tape. The performer plays a harpsichord, a highly cultured instrument with Eighteenth-Century (hence Enlightenment) associations, while the tape plays sounds which may have existed since time immemorial. The harpsi chord represents Europe; the sounds on the tape are clearly from every where else. The compositional approach opposes strict transcription with free improvisation. One might even argue that a paradoxical binary sur faces between "original" (natural, yet artificially recorded) sounds and "imitations" (the live performance, real but subservient to the model sound).</page><page sequence="6">Without Fooling the Bird 9 Upon closer inspection, however, most of these relations contain pri mary mediations. The structure of Korwar itself may seem to be a medi ation between items of an exclusive antithesis between "natural" sounds and a cultural instrument which imitates them. Yet, the acoustic instru ment still obeying the laws of nature is granted the present reality in a performance, and culture is already present on the tape as an opening and closing to the piece. The diagram below briefly lists the sounds used on the tape: Xhosa language Frogs Starling Shama Shrimp, Oreas Rain Harpsichords Shama Boar Boar(s), Guanaco The Boar and Shama sections are each split into a duality. Language and music?two human cultural products?are also divided on recorded por tion of the work as temporal extremities. The binary groupings of interest in Korwar are usually set up as imagi nary dialogues, yet this dialogue does not principally occur between the harpsichord and tape?not simply culture vs. nature. The instrumental part of Korwar finds itself too caught up in multiple imitation strategies to engage in a "communicative" way with the natural sounds. So whence does the interplay arise in the work? One structuralist theory that offers itself in explanation originates from L?vi-Strauss's thoughts on totemism in his 1962 book La Pens?e sauvage. Here, the anthropologist draws attention to the use of animal and natural symbols in "primitive" societies not in a fixed, reified way, but as a more universal grid of relations between the interactions of nature with nature and a parallel interaction between clans of a human culture. He clarifies, The homology they [totemic institutions] evoke is not between social groups and natural species but between the differences which manifest themselves on the level of groups on the one hand and on that of species on the other. They are thus based on the postulate of a homology between two systems of differences, one of which occurs in nature and the other in culture.13 More than an enigmatic magical contrivance, he sees totemism as a way of understanding class relations in a given culture?quite clearly a form of politics. In M?che's work, the natural sounds might relate to the harpsichord only as they relate to each other. For me, this would importantly reshape the "duo" mentality of most mixed-apparatus music that tacitly enforces a "dialogue" model to emphasize communication between realms.</page><page sequence="7">10 Perspectives of New Music L?vi-Strauss denounces the latter as a principal function of totemism. He stresses, "the conceptual systems we are studying here are not, or are not primarily, means of communication. They are means of thinking, an activity which is governed by very much less stringent conditions."14 While his final point may be arguable, his initial thought importantly lib erates the hypothetical "totemic" work of art from the onus of standard narrativity or a goal of immediate comprehensibility. If M?che's Korwar is then to be proven a sort of totemic item,15 the obvious animal and natural connections apart, the syntagmatic aspects of both the harpsichord and tape parts must be shown to have significant interrelations. The primary modus operan Ai of the piece clearly rests on a diversified principal of imitation. The harpsichord's emulation of the nat ural sounds engages its performer in a set of games that closely resemble the imitative structures already present on the prerecorded tape part. The relational meaning of the successive human, animal, and elemental sounds inform the internal coherence of the harpsichord's part?as it were two simultaneous dialogues on imitation (Example l):16 Tape: Harpsichord: x y z AAA A B C D etc. {A, B, C ...} = natural sounds {a, b, c ...} = imitative sounds {x, y, z ...} = categorical relations imitation strategies abed etc. VW x' y' z' EXAMPLE 1 In this model, the respective meanings of each natural sound find an interpretation through the structural ties linking them (x and x' in the example). As disinterested as L?vi-Strauss's dry structuralism may seem, it does not preclude poetic readings of either the phenomena or the relations. L?vi-Strauss preaches so eloquently about this emotional connection in human/animal totemism that he is worth quoting at length:</page><page sequence="8">Without Fooling the Bird I I Theoretical knowledge is not incompatible with sentiment . . . con crete relations between man and other living creatures sometimes, especially in civilizations in which science means 'natural science', color the entire universe of scientific knowledge with their own emotional tone, which is itself the result of this primitive identifica tion and, as Rousseau saw with his profound insight, responsible for all thought and society.17 An implicit warning in this passage supposes that once humankind has estranged itself from these close relations with animals (M?che repeatedly refers to mythic times when "animals still spoke"),18 the logic which organizes totemism may falter. L?vi-Strauss's direct advice to the ethnol ogist also applies to the urban listener/analyst of naturalist music: "approximate identification is not adequate since native observations are so precise."19 In order to find significance in a totemic structure, the nat ural referents must be as unambiguous as possible. With this I open a detailed examination of the tape part of Korwar. The tape divides into nine sections with the following source materials: 1. A woman speaking texts from the South African Xhosa language interspersed with the chirps of a shama?a Malaysian jungle bird 2. A chorus of several frogs (different species) divided into stereo channels 3. A starling addressing an unknown intruder with increasing agita tion 4. A wild pig grunting rhythmically 5. A large and virtuosic solo by the shama introduced in section 1 6. (=4 bis) A reprise of the pig of section 4, now joined by the squeals of a wild boar and the cries of a Peruvian domestic llama 7. The calls of several oreas (killer whales) accompanied by the tapping of shrimps on a submerged microphone 8. An imperceptible fade from the shrimps to the falling of rain on large leaves 9. A duo of recorded harpsichords playing structures similar to the live instrument with different time proportions. The first panel introduces the sounds of the Xhosa language and the cackle of the shama. The extraordinary dialogue between them empha sizes their respective features of assimilation. Xhosa is a member of the</page><page sequence="9">12 Perspectives of New Music South African Bantu family of languages which also includes Zulu. M?che sonically exploits its most salient feature, the famous clicks? consonants produced by suction of the tongue against various points in the mouth. The commentary of the shama seems harmlessly related as a reasonable punctuation of the language sounds. Yet, this beginning opens a much larger imitative field considering the information behind these sound producers, which contribute to the totemic mythology of Korwar. The shama (Copsychus malabaricus), a native of the Indian subconti nent and Malaysia, is not unlike many species of bird in that it is an accomplished mimic.20 Only later (section 5) in Korwar will its lustrous virtuosity become apparent, and in this capacity it is one of the rare trop ical forest songbirds that will sing in captivity. M?che alludes to having actually owned one, perhaps the one on this recording. Xhosa's history is also notable for its capacity of imitation. The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language outlines the unusual migration of the click sounds from the Khosian (Hottentot in former South African vernacular) family of languages to the "adjacent but historically unre lated" Bantu languages, including Xhosa. This non-idiomatic acquisition is still a mystery to linguists accustomed to much more gradual changes. The theory in vogue proposes that women imported the sounds to dis guise obscenities in their native tongue!21 M?che repeatedly stresses that he chose this language for its musical richness, not for cultural or semantic reasons. This restriction is surpris ing considering the complex relation the Xhosa language suggests with the shama. Since Xhosa is known as the mother tongue of Nelson Mandela, still imprisoned in 1972, the reference to a caged songbird resonates deeply.22 This dialogue of considerable totemic complexity muses on a structure of interwoven imitations. Yet, the elements are not placed in a binary until the following section. M?che displays considerable skill in dovetail ing the sections of Korwar. The tempo and rhythmic character of the Xhosa/shama blend naturally with the chorus of frogs that follows them. However, the relation between these sections is neither dialogic nor imi tative. I argue that they form a totemic binary. The section contrasts with the previous one by presenting a self-similar internal dialogue. The frogs are heard only against the sound of other kindred creatures. M?che gives no indication of the species of frogs he recorded, although they probably include Rana temporaria and Rana pipiens, common European varieties.23 The composer does give some important information about the meaning the frogs can have in this section. He writes,</page><page sequence="10">Without Fooling the Bird 13 When frogs sing together in a pond, each (with its own rhythm and register) arranges [its sound] in order to not function in the same tempo, so that the chances of being heard are sufficiently great, thus creating quite organized polyrhythms.24 The sonic goals of the frog are thus oppositional?for mating they wish to be maximally highlighted, for predators they scatter sound in a com plex web to prevent individual location. In relation to the totemic theme of "caged singing" in section 1, they represent an ambiguity around the notion of captivity, seemingly favoring its avoidance. This is fully clarified when the harpsichord's games of imitation are examined for these two sections. The broad relational binary sketched between sections one and two of the tape is mirrored with one of the work's thesis oppositions in the harp sichord: notation versus improvisation. (A word about M?che's score? the tape part is scrupulously transcribed only when coordination with the instrumentalist is consequential.) Section one abounds in careful align ments, lending toward notation. Section two calls for a gradual rapprochement with the tape, and consists of a verbal instruction to improvise. The game of imitation in section one primarily belongs to the composer?he elaborates a beautifully worked out system of phonetic transposition?"Xhosa for harpsichord." Initially, the lingual clicks?the language's most salient feature?are represented by shocks on the pedal. (See Example 2.) A few measures later, the "height"25 of the vowel coupled with each click is approximated by pitch clusters. Thus, in Example 3, the vowels [o] and [u] are contrasted with the vowel [i] by clusters of the same ambitus played a ninth and a twelfth lower respec tively. In the final stage of this gradual transcription, a pitch aggregate denoting each sound combination in Xhosa enters into play.26 The chart in Example 6 displays a fragment of this system based on similar phonetic logic as Example 3. The vowel "height" determines the carrier pitch: A5=[i], BWKe], C3=[a], D2=[o], and El=[u]. The relative distortion rendered to these formants by the consonants is expressed with addi tional notes. A syllable thus synthetically becomes a chord. Example 4 shows this scheme integrated into the musical fabric. In Example 5, the harpsichord alone utters a Xhosa phrase without the vocal referent. Thus, in section one of Korwar, the harpsichord shuttles between a vague impression of the sound to a system of representation that can ultimately replace it.</page><page sequence="11">14 Perspectives of New Music chocs du pied sur la p?dale EXAMPLE 2: KORWAR PHONETIC TRANSCRIPTION 1 ?

M?che sug gests a rhythmic model, but contextualizes it with verbal directions: "improvisation of clusters . . . independent of the tape, with silences . . . little by little the rhythms align with those of the tape, to the point of ending synchronized."27 The underlying totemic relation of capture to avoidance in the tape part is mirrored in the binary musical organization of the harpsichord part (composition/improvisation), but contradicted by the similar game of imitation it is playing (gradual capture). The identity politics of Korwar"s imitations (at least in these sections) sketch a rather traditional anthropological view of human development from nature to culture: the subject moves from imitation as belonging (just another click in the language, just another frog in the pond) to vir tual representation as a gesture of appropriation and control. M?che's skill resides in placing that history in a condensed form in the hands of the performer as an empathy exercise meant to problematize it. The first conflict occurs when the same trajectory of control emerges in two differ ent musical activities: faithful rendition of a notated score, and more intuitive analogue improvisation. The third section of the tape, consisting of a heated performance by a starling, introduces yet another type of dialogue to Korwar. Here, the</page><page sequence="14">Without Fooling the Bird 17 natural sound seems directed at an unspecified interloper?a notion that implicates the listener of the work along with the composer (both "absent" while present at a performance). The bird's increasing agitation is obviously caused by an intruder, an "other" which is not represented by the tape. The silent passivity of this other does not exclude its ability to cause tremendous alarm. The Sturnus vulgaris (common starling) is the first urban citizen present in Korwar, and as such may provide a further conflation between the listener/composer as unheard/invisible intruder. The relational meanings the starling can embody include commonness and even nui sance. Certain species of the bird approach the status of urban pests, like the even more vulgar pigeon.28 The starling's unique distress call, such as the one approached in Korwar, can actually be used as a form of pest control?harmlessly inverting the body of a captured bird causes it to emit a signal which will drive other bothersome Sturni from the vicinity of the sound. Yet, significantly for our previous "trapped" specimens in Korwar, the distress call of a caged animal has no effect on wild birds of the same species.29 A free bird is apparently not so easy to fool. The starling's status in the totem of Korwar can only be mediational. It opposes the exotic/wild characteristic of the Xhosa/Shama and leans towards the more common frog. The contingent character of its captivity provides the most direct mediation between the relations of sections one and two. We cannot be informed about who or what is irritating this bird, since that element of the dialogue is off the field of representation. Even the knowledge of its caged/unconfined status is left ambiguous? the answer could only be given by a free starling.00 The harpsichord portion of section three continues (in proper L?vi-Straussian manner) to preserve the structural relation between the tape parts. Therefore, its function mediates as well. After the controlling games of sections one and two, the starling imitations presented forge a middle path approximating what M?che calls Venduit esth?tique*1 (aes thetic coating). Bits of the starling's chirps are coordinated with colora tions from the harpsichord, a sort of intermittent orchestration of its sounds. What seems to really aggravate the bird is the imitation of its fluttering wings made by the harpsichord through rapid sauter eaux muets (the sounds of the mechanical action of the harpsichord without coupling it to any strings). The bird's first fortissimo outburst immedi ately follows this "provocation." The composed clusters the harpsichord plays after this point are a sort of dialogic (not imitative) dovetailing into the sounds of the pig in section four. The important question that surfaces in the above section is whether imitation is really flattering (as common knowledge would have us</page><page sequence="15">18 Perspectives of New Music believe) or aggressively annoying. Anyone who has ever had their speech accent aped by an interlocutor can agree with the tension of the latter. Some of Korwar rises to the level of an interspecies challenge between a natural sound source and a protean mimicry machine. The brief bridge, section four, relates to the previous section in that the pig, like the starling, emits sound for someone/something beyond the recording. (M?che suggests he is courting a sow.) The return to improvisation in the harpsichord, while contrasting with section three's notation, points out a crucial difference in technique between the natural referent and its human imitator. M?che warns the performer to avoid cre ating cycles in the analogue improvisation, something apparently not a problem for the pig. Section five is the grand centerpiece of Korwar, the solo of the shama, the caged bird we heard at the beginning in such a limited imitative rep ertoire. Its performance provides an imposing aesthetic standard for the rest of the piece. M?che's preferential keystone placement of this bird's magnificent outpouring emphasizes the poverty and impotence of culture to compete with such natural virtuosity. The harpsichord's imitation scheme parallels the treatment of the starling, applying self abnegating punctuation strokes at carefully coordinated points. The harpsichord's timbrai inflexibility begins to belie its own "cultural varnish" compared with such an orchestral bird. M?che's intended collision of nature with culture reaches a peculiar apogee in this section by asserting the possibility of aesthetic pleasure for non-human "musicians." The gratuitous, rhapsodic nature of the shama's solo stands in purple contrast with the grimmer "necessity" which seemed to elicit the previous sounds on the tape. The shama demands that such a contingent interpretation of natural sounds be reformed. M?che has always firmly insisted that animal signals can be aesthetic?specifically produced for the pleasure of both the animal and the listener: Among zoologists, birds are reputed to sing only for extremely specific ends: to find a mate, to protect their territory, but not 'for pleasure'. The same zoologists implicitly assume that it is otherwise with humans, and that is why they are wary of anthropomorphism. Korwar is not expressly written to procure me a partner nor to affirm my exclusive rights (my 'aesthetic originality') on this particu lar 'branch' which is 'naturalist' music; but some spiteful sociologist could think this anyway. ... I prefer, for myself, to say, inversely, that the bird, the frog, experience through their outpourings at least something like a physical pleasure; and why not call this pleasure 'musical'?32</page><page sequence="16">Without Fooling the Bird 19 The acceptance of the animal's enjoyment in this section is curiously har nessed to the renunciation by the instrumentalist of most of the fun, in a harried attempt to coordinate with such a liberated expression. The symmetry created by the shama's solo (complimenting the punc tuating chirps in section one) completes a binary between restricted expression and a fully liberated one. A parallel emancipation awaits our patient harpsichordist, who will finally have a voice in the final section. The dualizing of sections continues after the shama with the reprise of the pig, which I have called section six (or four bis). The significant addi tion of a wild boar and a llama guanaco recontextualize the formal rela tion of this section to the rest of the piece. The boar's response to the pig likens this part to the frogs of section three as a genus-related communi cation. The Sus scrofa of the Suidae family includes the "wild" boar and the "domestic" swine?both of which are biologically similar enough to interbreed or compete for resources. While the frog's communal chant rang of a shared ritual, the pigs' sounds suggest their rivalry. The cries of the ruminant Llama guanaco punctuate their conflict, related more for mally as music, although supported by zoosemioticians as having a "warning" function.33 M?che's inclusion of a full range of animal sounds, from pleasurable expression to necessary warning, colors the experience of the harpsi chordist who is constantly imitating them. The movement between exact transcription and improvisation earlier seen to embody a capture narrative is now structurally tinged by a similar vacillation between enjoyment and urgency that may be composed as the inverse of the animal experience. We saw how the empathetic experience of the first three sections of Korwar physically outlined a history of representation. In a similar vein, the fourth through sixth sections present a brief history of so-called virtuosity and its relation to physical pleasure, exemplified in its "natural form" by the shama solo. The self-denial necessary to achieve this on a human scale resists natural outpouring through a stringent set of rules ultimately meant to produce the jouissance of mastery. Even certain cul tural formulae must be repressed in this process (not just innate uneven ness)?for example, cyclic repetition must be avoided in the first pig improvisation. A competitive spirit is born of these strivings (among musicians of a similar calling and otherwise) as seen in the pig, boar, and guanaco of section six. The notion in Korwar that the beauties of nature collude to form a sort of conclusive, discouraging limit to cultural ambitions could not be better symbolized than by the shama. Messiaen refers to this very bird in an anecdote about the confines of human virtuosity:</page><page sequence="17">20 Perspectives of New Music Manuel Rosenthal's wife, who is a singer and singing-teacher, had bought a superb Indian shama (a marvelous singing cage-bird); the shama sang all day long, and during lessons, excited by music in the next room, it redoubled its efforts, singing so well that the pupils were ashamed of their own voices: finally lessons couldn't be given because so much time was spent in listening to the bird and going into ecstasies over the brilliance of its talents.34 Messiaen's emphasis on the shame felt by the human subject perhaps smacks of Edenic banishment?only when driven from the perfect bosom of divine nature do man and woman sense their nakedness. What M?che and to some extent L?vi-Strauss seek in this uncomfortable awareness is a political limit to humanism. For L?vi-Strauss the limits of human ambition are expressed in totemism as a relation: "the ritual expression of interdependence between social order and the natural envi ronment."35 As long as humanity expresses itself within this circumscrip tion, the results will be harmonious. M?che's harpsichord part in Korwar physically translates this self-limitation. Speaking of his exterior political goals in creating Korwar, he goes much further than restriction, calling it a gesture of "adieu to a certain humanism."36 Although he does not specify which humanism, one can suspect the 1960-70s' French Pompidou Giscard d'Estaing liberalism attacked equally by Foucault in the same era. The final stretch of Korwar makes a dramatic plunge into the depths.37 The shrieks of several "communicating" killer whales (Orcinus orea) clearly demarcate the beginning of section seven. The swarming sound which is to characterize the entire end of the piece is here produced by a multitude of shrimps clawing at a submerged microphone. This most unusual sound source was apparently an uncontrollable by-product of the whale recording; yet it creates a new field of meaning to natural sound. While it may be arguable that the sounds on the previous portion of Korwar's tape were "consciously" produced, the shrimps' noises present unreflected38 biological movement as sound. The oreas, while sharing the aquatic realm with the shrimps, project a conscious dialogue that seems to be communication. Analysts of the pho nology of whale utterance are anxious to categorize it as language,39 although this controversy does not interest M?che, whose appreciation of the sounds is primarily musical. He finds the relation between language and music to be overstated, and his attitudes on communication in music are no less dismissive. What is achieved structurally through these sounds is a mediation between our previous two self-similar dialogues?the frogs and the pigs. Between the "cold" ritual function of the frogs and the</page><page sequence="18">Without Fooling the Bird 21 "hot" competitive interaction of the pigs falls the ambivalent dialogue of the whales, perhaps belonging to both or neither of the above categories. The harpsichord's subservient sense of timing becomes somewhat mit igated in this section, by the aid of an external device; a chronometer is meant to supplement the musical notation to coordinate huge forearm clusters with the recorded whale calls. The dense quality of the sounds in this section contrast with the gradually rarefying general texture, such that the shrimps' low murmur imperceptibly blends with section eight, a recording of rain falling on tropical leaves. M?che reinforces the mythic aquatic connection between the sub merged creatures and precipitation through the felicitous concordance of their physical sounds. The falling rain also furthers a sense of multiplicity, of swarming nature. The harpsichord's tentative imitation of this patter begins as an improvisation for sautereaux muets earlier used to suggest the starling's wings. Soon, a short pitch pattern emerges?a little wedge shape in various sixteenth-note patterns. (See Example 7.) The first ele mental (as opposed to animal) imitation in Korwar seems very liberating for the harpsichordist, who seizes it to form the final section of the piece, linked attacca with its antecedent. 454?2] |2'25"j \2'30"\ \2'39"\ et quelques chocs sur la p?dale d'accouplement, sans faire sonner de note. EXAMPLE 7: TRANSITION FROM RAIN IMPROVISATION TO HARPSICHORD DIALOGUE (SHOWING "CHRONOMETER" TIME FRAMES) (SCORE MEASURE 454)</page><page sequence="19">22 Perspectives of New Music In this last section, culture is granted a self-similar dialogue with itself: the live instrumentalist coordinates with two recorded harpsichords. The material of this section loosely resembles Gy?rgy Ligeti's 1968 Continuum, also for harpsichord, which achieves a very gradual registral expansion through similar cells in contrary motion. Yet M?che's poetic effect, much more naturalist than Ligeti's mechanical vision, derives from the swarm and buzz of the elements. The harpsichords are placed in respective time frames of fifteen, ten, and six seconds each, each applying a variable rhythmic model suggested by M?che to the pitch collections indicated in the score. (See Example 8.) Dans toute la s?quence finale le clavecin joue la main gauche sur le clavier du bas, la main droite sur l'autre, et encha?ne les rythmes en ?vitant toute cellule cyclique et toute r?p?tition de plus de deux notes ou accords identiques. (J=113) example 8: rhythmic framework applicable to pitch collections and their respective timeframes (from score pages 28 and 29)</page><page sequence="20">Without Fooling the Bird 23 In this latter aspect, M?che opens a notation mediating between exact composition and improvisation, which have been alternated throughout the work to this point. He uses a trame, a French word suggesting frame work or loom. He specifies the pitch content and gives a rhythmic model to which the notes are applied freely. The coordination between the live and recorded harpsichords is deliberately compromised for the teeming effect?a miniature nature built out of cultural materials. The very multiplicity of nature may give dangerous suggestions to human society such as discussed by Elias Canetti in Crowds and Power.^0 M?che's final coup-de-grdce of imitative strategies places culture in a naturalistic relation to itself?with orgiastic results. This implies again a warning against an unbridled humanism, even when that excess is in emulation of nature. Importantly for L?vi-Strauss, destructive hubris vis-?-vis nature may be reduced to a structural flaw. Direct imitation of nature, as an unruly mob might seek, can produce disastrous effects. Yet, if a totemic model is observed, mankind examines nature in relation to itself, and understands societal interaction on the basis of these relations. M?che, although he may be interpreted totemically, wants to erase the major distinction between cultural output and natural phenomena. The formal continuity between shrimp, rain, and harpsichords on the tape denies superiority or causality to any of them. Likewise, the harpsichord's sudden leap to a culturally "invented" music in the final section cannot really be separated qualitatively from the music it produced while closely imitating a sound source. The guilty conscience of "abstract" music is illustrated by this specious arrival at "culture" suggested by the sudden absence of "natural" referents on the tape. The music continues to imi tate the shrimps and rain, but no longer makes that relationship explicit. Thus, the final third of the work, comprising sections seven through nine, totemically contributes to the previous two (the capture narrative and the pleasure narrative) a continuity narrative between sentient and non-conscious sound producers. M?che does not allow the listener to separate the flow from the "mindless" sounds of shrimp and the rain from the "intelligent" sounds of the whales and harpsichords. Each energy flows into culture. The sound world of the harpsichords derives from the senseless swarm, but apparently constitutes a dialogue between sentient beings. The sheer physicality of the shrimps' motion and the rain's fall connects with the corporal pleasure insisted upon by M?che for his animal musicians. The games of imitation first established to "ensnare" the creatures' sounds arrive at an accultured state that is no longer able to benefit from its empathetic potential, since it denies its natural debts.</page><page sequence="21">24 Perspectives of New Music Summarizing our structuralist findings in Korwar enables us to approach the social critique M?che's naturalism proposes in music. An overview chart would appear as follows: Part I Part II Part III Capture/ Virtuosity/ Non-conscious/ Freedom Pleasure Sentient Sections 1-3 Sections 4-6 Sections 7-9 The broad relationships between the tape and harpsichord parts suggest the following development: similar in Part I (both relate to captivity/freedom as a function of imitation), opposing in Part II (plea sure ratio is inverted between animal and imitator), and mediating in Part III (gradual fusion of senseless and intelligent nature in cultural activity). Ultimately, the point of examining Korwar the way L?vi-Strauss analyzed totemic institutions was not just to point out formal binary interaction and pleasing symmetries within the work. The supreme "why?" behind naturalist music is simply too grand to approach head-on, like the raison-d'?tre of mythical thought in primitive societies. As this paper has often reiterated, both systems of expression refer to the problematic shift from nature to culture (and vice-versa) which traditional history is helpless to explain. The important interrelations between the two non-stable entities are stressed both by M?che's work and structural anthropology, a discipline that may be otherwise unrelated or antithetic to the former's concerns. Both thinkers contest a humanist priority of culture which fails to recognize its debts. L?vi-Strauss specifies the attitude he deplores as "the conviction?which originated during the Renaissance and which never stopped growing?that man, lord and master of nature, exists on the one side, and, on the other side, there is nature, no more than a thing, an object, an instrument."41 The mutually exclusive juxtaposition of nature and culture also bothers M?che, who described his project as a blurring of borders between the two, "in order to suggest a counterculture." This counterculture emphasizes play?here, games of imitation. How then does M?che politicize this act? Our structuralist glance at Korwar sought to uncover the multiple meanings that imitation can have by comparing a direct emulation (the harpsichord's constant striving to create sounds similar to the recorded source) with structural relations (the syntagmatic flow?nature's interac tion with itself as a model.) For me, what emerges from this query is a</page><page sequence="22">Without Fooling the Bird 25 series of empathy exercises meant to make the performer physically aware of the permeability of limits placed between nature and culture. The empathy does not produce a Rousseauist "compassion" for the animal subject or the natural forces. It instead places the performer in a position where naturalist logic colors his/her experience and responsibilities. In Part I, for example, we saw how the impounded histories of the natural sound sources contributed to an understanding of representation as capture across the traditional borders of notation and improvisation. Part IPs imitations inverted the traditional relation between virtuosity and pleasure, competition and seduction. Part III sought to erase any qualitative distinction between the supposedly "senseless" and "intelli gent" in nature by presenting them unified in culture. The sheer variety of imitative games played in Korwar created a much larger field than cursorily expected: gradual representations, miniature orchestrations, competitive dialogues, self-denying emulations, cultural appropriations, and all the mediations between these. Specific inquiry about the natural musicians were necessary to clarify both their interrela tions and the significance of the instrumentalist's game with them. Although Fran?ois-Bernard M?che is not an anthropologist, his natu ralist imitative strategy in Korwar shares that science's persuasion that valuable human knowledge is formed in the experience of otherness, more than through personal introspection. Anthropology's active repu diation of ethnocentricism is critiqued for its own anthropocentrism by M?che 's brand of naturalism. A series of interactions between a harpsi chordist and taped animal sounds hardly consists of a critical politics? perhaps the equivalent of a caged bird's singing. However, I believe it may propose a type of social training. The alarming significance of Korwar's musical games may only be available to those with minds open to such a borderless space of nature/culture. The meaning that this aes thetic holds for animals themselves has yet to be explored. We have seen that their experience of otherness is sometimes affected by the captivity of the subject. (Remember the starling distress call . . .) We must also keep in mind that a free bird is very hard to fool.</page><page sequence="23">26 Perspectives of New Music Notes 1. M?che 1998, 75. 2.
