<plain_text><page sequence="1">A STRAND IN THE CORD OF HEBRAIC HYMNODY by Η. L. Ginsberg Jewish Theological Seminary of America STAGE ONE: PSALM 29 Today the high antiquity of this hymn is admitted on all hands.1 Note, then, the following features. YHWH resembles a Syrian Baal-Hadad, riding the storm2 and uttering shattering peals of thunder. At the same time, he bears the epithet of the head of the Ugaritian pantheon, 'king' (v. 10), and the divine beings {bne 'elim) — but a step removed from being a pantheon of real gods — are called upon to give honor to him by reason of his (Baal-like) majesty i'pz). That even the bne 'elim, or simply 'elim (note the 'Ugaritic' terms, the later ones being bne 'eldhim and 'elohim), stand in awe of YHWH is stressed just in two other very old passages: Ps. 89: 7-8 (part of the old cosmic hymn Ps. 89: 2-19 minus 1 Cf. Η. J. Kraus: Die Psalmen I2, Neukirchen, 1961, p. 235, who cites the literature on the Canaanite background of the psalm and concludes that it is perhaps one of the oldest psalms in the Old Testament. 2 M. Dahood: Psalms I (Anchor Bible), New York, 1966, p. 176, is to be commended for noting (as I did in BJPES 6 [1939], pp. 96-97) that the waters of v. 3 are those of the Mediterranean Sea, since 'the poem describes a storm moving in from the west.' Consistently with this insight, Dahood again disinguishes himself favorably from Kraus and from Weiser by refusing to confuse the wilderness of Kadesh (v. 8) with the oasis of Kadesh in the Sinai peninsula and insisting that it must lie somewhere in Syria. In opposition to Weiser, who sees in v. 8 a reference to the Sinai tradition, Dahood ob serves, 'But he fails to mention that nowhere is the wilderness of Sinai called midbar qades, and he equally fails to record that mdbr qds is mentioned in Ugaritic.' I applaud this all the more because I myself had occasion a quarter of a century earlier to counter the identical argument, from a critic who anticipated Weiser, with the identical rejoinder (in greater detail), ibid. The occasion in question was the publication of my further observation that since the storm, in Ps. 29, sweeps from the Mediterranean Sea (v. 3), to the Lebanon range (v. 5) and from Lebanon to Sirion (i.e. the anti-Lebanon range, v. 6), the physical feature named next — the desert of Kadesh (v. 8) — must (1) lie east of Sirion and (2) be of the same order of magnitude as the three preceding; which is to say that it can only be the Syrian desert. w. 4-5);ג Ex. 15: ll.4 That the concluding verse of Ps. 29 (Ps. 29: 11) prays that this ineffably majestic God may lend majesty (,pz) to his people rather than to his anointed one (contrast 1 Sam. 2: lOe-f), is possibly a sign of pre-monarchic compo sition; at any rate, its resemblance to the conclusion of Ps. 68 — whose pre-monarchic antiquity is so 3 The best study on Ps. 89 known to me is that of Ν. M. Sarna in Biblical and Other Studies (ed. Alexander Altmann), Cambridge (Mass.), 1963, pp. 29-46. 4 In Ex. 15: 17, lines b and c can only be taken in apposi tion to the end of line a, with the entire verse referring to the Holy Land that YHWH made, not to the temple that Solomon built, in accordance with the Jewish Publication Society's new translation of the Torah (1962): You will bring them and plant them in Your own mountain, The place You made Your abode, Ο Lord, The sanctuary, Ο Lord, which Your hands established. But one has a feeling (cf. for example, the somewhat harsh absence of a repetition of 'in' before 'the place' and 'the sanctuary') that either the author or a later hand has adapted the formula with which Solomon inaugurated the temple (1 Kings 8:13). In the former event, the poem is most probably of Solomonic or early post-Solomonic authorship, in the latter it more probably antedates the building of the temple. A third early poetic equivalent of the later (bne) 'elohim 'divine beings' is bne 'el, which was long assumed to be the reading behind the LXX's (kata arithmbn) aggelon theoii, Deut. 32: 8, and is now directly attested in a tiny Hebrew manuscript fragment from Qumran; see P. W. Skehan: BASOR 136 (1954), p. 12. The importance of this fragment lies in the fact that there is some small doubt whether its reading really stood in the Septuagint's vorlage. Since on the one hand it only rarely renders bne ('Slohim) by dggeloi but in the overwhelming majority of instances employs rather huiol, and on the other hand it does render sar by dggelos in Dan. 10:21; 12:1 (passages whose ideological dependence on Deut. 32: 8 is obvious), the possibility that in Deut. 32: 8 it read not bny 7 but sry '1 must be weighed. But that has become less probable now that the abovementioned Qumran fragment is known. Now it even appears possible that there never was a reading Sry 7 in Deut. 32:8, and that MT's bny ysr'l is a conflation not of two readings bny'/ and Sry'/ but rather of the reading bny'/ and a gloss sry. But in one or other of these ways, MT arose through conflation, and future critical editions of the text should say so.</page><page sequence="2">46 Η. L. GINSBERG obvious that v. 30, or at least the expression 'to Jerusalem' in v. 30, is regarded as an interpolation by many — is striking: although Ps. 68: 33 ff. diverges from Ps. 29 in calling upon the princes of the earth rather than upon the divine beings to ascribe majesty ('pz, v. 35) to YHWH (so originally for 'Eldhim), it concludes (v. 36), like Ps. 29, with the thought that the latter in turn lends majesty ('oz) and glory to his people. STAGE TWO: PSALM 96 The echoes from Ps. 29 in Ps. 96: 7, 8a, and 9a are obvious; one might also say that 96 has taken over from 29 the motif that YHWH is to be adored be cause he is King (96: 10) and more awful than any 'eldhim. But this is a convenient place to begin to list the differences. ,Eldhim can mean the same thing as bne 'elim, namely 'divine beings', or 'angels', who are real and live; but it can also mean 'gods', and v. 5 makes it clear that the latter are meant, and that all the gods of other peoples are nothings, and it was YHWH who made the heavens. So our psalmist is being very logical when, instead of wasting breath calling on these nothings to ascribe glory and majesty to YHWH, he substitutes in v. 9 for Ps. 29's bne ,elim not his own kol 'elbhim 'all gods' of v. 4 but misphbt 'ammim '0 families of peoples' (v. 7), as if to say, Ό you who have been wasting your time on "all the gods of the peoples (v. 5)".' In fact, his very opening verse is: Sing to YHWH a new song; sing to YHWH, all the earth. All and sundry are to praise YHWH ('bless his name') and to spread the good tidings of his help (ysup), v. 2. Help to whom? To all the world, as we shall see. The same is true of his wonders (v. 3). For where the author of 29 called upon the celestials to do homage to YHWH because he is such a majestic king, our people calls on all peoples to do so because he is such a good, such a beneficent king (10): 'Announce among the nations, "YHWH has assumed kingship."5 Truly, the world shall stand firm, it shall not totter; he will provide for the peoples with graciousness.' A periodic festival? 'Provide for the peoples with graciousness' ? Why not 'judge the peoples with equity', which is what the phrase is commonly supposed to mean ? Because, firstly, in the latter case the world would not stand firm but would collapse, and heaven, earth, the sea and all it contains, the fields and all that are in them, and the very trees of the forest — or whatever survived of all these — would have cause not for jubilation (vv. 11-12) but for lamentation. On the treatment of underlings by their superiors, Hamlet observes in his flippancy, 'Use every man after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?' On God's treatment of his creatures, the psalmist (Ps. 130: 3-6) meditates in his earnestness, 'If You, Ο Yah, kept strict tally of sins, Ο Lord, who could live on? But there is pardon with You, so that You may be worshiped.' For even God's most faithful worshipers have merited death many times. That 'emunp (v. 13) means 'kindness, grace' in, for exam pie, Ps. 88: 12 is well known, and if one reads that verse together with the following one (88: 13), one can see that hised(of course!) andpele and fdpqp also have that meaning. But this 'emunp can be parallel to f edeq (96:13) as well, and it follows that we must also interpret mesarim (96: 11; 98:9) in this sense. And secondly, the rendering 'provide for' instead of 'judge' can also be justified. To begin with, the meaning 'to lead, govern', which sppat obviously has in Jud. 3: 10; 4:4; etc.; 2 Kings 15:5; Is. 40: 23; Ps. 2: 10, is not so far removed from 'to provide for'; and to continue, look at the passages to which Kaufmann15 has called attention in this connection. There is firstly Job 36: 27 if. It certainly bristles with difficulties, but it is at least clear that it speaks of rain. Kaufmann therefore suggests that when v. 31 says, 'For by means of them ypdin the peoples, bestows food in abundance (or, upon the multitude)', 'by means of them' must refer to the 'canopies of rain-cloud' in v. 30, and ypdin must mean 'he provides for'. Then again, consider Ps. 67:4-5: The peoples praise You, Ο 'YHWH', all the peoples praise You, the nations rejoice and cheer; for tispot the peoples misdr, 6 Y. Kaufmann: Tdldot hg-'emung hay-yisr'eli! Π, pp. 721-23.</page><page sequence="3">A STRAND IN THE CORD OF HEBRAIC HYMNODY 47 tdki'h nations with $edeq.7 Selah. The peoples praise You, Ο 'YHWH', all the peoples praise You; (for) the earth has yielded its produce. In the context, what can tispgt and its restored syno nym t0ki"t1 mean but 'You provide for' ? And what can misdr and its restored synonym $ideq mean but 'kindness, graciousness' ? Similarly the nouns mispgt and fdgqg mean 'care, providence' in Ps. 36: 6-8. Had Kaufmann realized that the verb sgpat again means 'to provide for' in Is. 51: 5, he would not have made the mistake of thinking that the conno tations of 'the arm(s) of YHWH' in clauses c and e are almost antonymous, chastisement in the one and bounty in the other.8 Give sppa( here too the meaning 'to provide for', and it becomes obvious that in clause c YHWH's arms (plural) are the means by which he extends help and in clause e his arm (singular) is either likewise the means by which he extends help or the help itself. We shall have more to say on the meaning of 'the arm of YHWH' in Second Isaiah further on, under the heading of 'Stage Four'. STAGE THREE: PSALM 98 Of what the author of Ps. 96 took over from Ps. 29, the author of Ps. 98 in turn has taken over only the figure of YHWH as a King who is to be honored. It has dropped 96's modification of 29's idea that YHWH is more awful than the 'divine beings' (bne 'elirri), namely the former's ridicule of 'the gods of the peoples' (96: 4-5), as also the vestiges of Ps. 29 diction that are to be found in 96: 7, 8a, 9a. As against these omissions, it adds to the glorification of YHWH's benefactions (ysu φ, 96: 2; niplg'ot, 96: 3) to all nations and to all the world, the glori fication of his special benefactions to Israel (98: 1-3). It also substitutes musical acclamation (98: 4-6) for 96's oblation (96: 8b). For the rest, to be sure, it begins and ends almost exactly like 96, so that at first sight it looks like an abridgment of 96, though in light of the foregoing it is considerably more than that. 7 For bg'gref tanhfm read bfitfeq toklah. 8 Op. cit. IV, p. 501. STAGE FOUR: SECOND ISAIAH The opening of Is. 42: 10-17 is more akin to Ps. 96: 1 than to Ps. 98: la, since the latter contains no parallel to the prophet's 'his glory from the end of the earth' whereas Ps. 96: lb is such a parallel. (Further on in Ps. 98, in v. 4a, we do find a parallel to the Deutero-Isaian phrase in question, but that is too far away from the opening.) On the other hand, it is Ps. 98: 7 and not 96: lib that offers a complete parallel to Is. 42: lOc-d (in clause c, by the way, yir'am is no doubt to be read, with others). Good, the reader may think, but why is the present writer convinced, with Mowinckel9 and Kauf mann,10 that the dependence is on the side of the prophet when the overwhelming consensus of opinion is that it is on the side of the psalmists? Mainly, I reply, because the psalms make all the good sense of a motif in its original application while the Deutero-Isaiah passage exemplifies the illogic which besets reusers of existing motifs. A simple illustration is the application in Dan. 2 of the series of four metals in descending order of value, which was originally conceived as a symbol of the four ages of a progressively deteriorating world, to a series of empires which the author — in contrast to many a simple-minded modern inter preter — did not regard as a consistently descending series in any sense. So too in our case, for the summons to the nations, the heavens, the earth, the rivers, the forests, and the tress of the field to whoop, Pss. 96 and 98 give a good reason: an infinitely good and kind King has come to tend them. But what reason does Is. 42: 10 ff. give? That YHWH is on the warpath, that his blood-curdling yell is going to destroy hills and mountains and dessicate a vast territory as well as, presumably, wreak havoc among his human enemies (v. 13)! At the end, to be sure, the prophet offers a new motive for re joicing: YHWH is going to enable the Jews to traverse the most difficult terrain with miraculous ease and return to their homeland (16); but can that be expected — in light of the foregoing! — to rouse anybody but the Jews to such wild transports of joy? Is. 44: 23 ; 49: 13; 55: 12 are at least not accompanied by anything in the nature of 42: 13 9 S. Mowinckel: Psalmenstudien Π, Kristiania, 1923. 10 Y. Kaufmann, op. cit. Π, pp. 721-725.</page><page sequence="4">48 Η. L. GINSBERG 15; but even here, if one asks, 'Which reason was originally given for the rapturous joy of these entities: that of the ki clauses in Ps. 96: 13; 98: 9 or that of the ki clauses in Is. 44:23 ; 49: 13; 55: 12?' the answer can only be: the former. In addition to the summons to all creation to shout for all it is worth, which is common to Stages Two and Three, Second Isaiah has made ex tensive use of the element which, we saw above, was the new contribution of Stage Three, namely Ps. 98: lb-3. As a matter of convenience we shall re produce and number the clauses of this passage and then refer to them by number: 1. כי נפלאות עשה (lb) 2. הושיעה־לו ימינו (lc) 3. וזרוע קדשו (Id) 4. 2) הודיע יהוה ישועתוa) [42) לכל־הארץ .'a')?] 5. 2) לעיני הגויםb) 6. 2) גלה צדקתוc) 7. 3) זכר חסדו ואמנתוa) 8. 3) לבית ישראלb) 9. 3) ראו כל־אפסי־ארץc) 10. 3) את ישועת אלהינוd) It is obviously from elements Nos. 2 and 3 that Second Isaiah Is. 40:10b (here apparently substitut ing משלה for הושיעה, but I suspect that the former is a corruption of 16 :59 ;(מושיעהc (I shall speak of 16d presently); 63: 5c (I shall speak of 5d presently) are descended. More remarkable is what the prophet has done in 52: 10, whose clauses we shall reproduce and letter: a חשף יהוה את־זרוע קדשו b לעיני כל־הגוים c וראו כל־אפסי־ארץ d את ישועת אלהינו Obviously, Is. 52: 10c-d is simply a takeover of elements 9-10 above. More complicated is the genesis of line a. Its object is element 3; but as for its verb, the idea of it derives from element 6, but the borrower has substituted for גלה 'to reveal'— which is equally suitable for an abstract object like 'vindication' (צדקה) and a conrete one like 'arm' (חשף — (זרוע 'to bare', which is appropriate only with the latter (by all means note Ez. 4: 7). This extreme concreteness, however, not only makes the anthropomorphism unnecessarily crude but leaves a logical hiatus between a-b and c-d. The baring of the arm is a — dispensable — preli minary to the working of ישועה; it does not itself constitute ישועה· Lines c-d only follow smoothly on a-b if זרוע 'arm5 is virtually synonymous with ישועה 'triumph'. This it obviously is in at least one more passage in our author: Is. 53: lb, which is also a combination of elements 3 and 6, farther removed from the model as regards the voice of the verb (passive instead of active) but closer as regards its identity (gly, not hsp). A good decade ago I attempted — I still believe, successfully — to unmask another such zrounder the ζ era' of 53: 10.11 To 51: 5e I have already referred at the end of my discussion of 'Stage Two'. It may be argued that after all arm is a not un natural metonymy for help, and could have occurred to a writer through a simpler process than the fer mentation of Ps. 98: lb-3 (as we have it) in his mind. The point is, however, that the general pro position that Second Isaiah knew and was influ enced by Ps. 98 in general and by vv. lc-d, 3c-d thereof in particular is proved beyond the shadow of a doubt in the first three paragraphs of this section ('Stage Four'), and this fact makes our ex planation of his use of זרוע in the sense of ישועה or צדקה the only natural one. And there is additional evidence, which had not occurred to me at the time when I wrote the note just referred to: it is that, conversely, the צדקה 'vin dication' of clause No. 6, above, is employed in the sense of the ימין 'right hand' of clause No. 2, above, in Is. 59:16, and according to the indubitably correct reading of 30 manuscripts, 63: 5 (where the textus receptus resulted from contamination by the following verse). How to translate sdgqg into Eng lish in these two passages is a problem (perhaps 'victorious right hand'); but although the usual quibbling is to be anticipated, this meaning and our explanation of how the word came to have it are the only possible ones. stage five: psalm 147 First of all, this is certainly a late hymn. The climax to which it works up in its praise of YHWH is (vv. 19-20): 11 JBL 77 (1958), pp. 152-56.</page><page sequence="5">A STRAND IN THE CORD OF HEBRAIC HYMNODY 49 Who revealed his words to Jacob, his laws and rules to Israel, but did not thus for any other nation, imparted not his rules, to them.12 Praise Yah! The sentiment is that of Deut. 4:8: 'Or what great nation has laws and rules as perfect as all this Teaching that I am setting forth before you this day?' It did not become the sentiment of Judaism until the age in which Ezra obtained — or until the age which believed that Ezra had obtained — from Artaxerxes I (464-424 B.C.) or Artaxerxes II (404-359 B.C.) letters patent whose climax is his authorization to organize instruction in God's laws (Ezra 7: 25): 'And you, Ezra, in accordnace with the wisdom you have from your God, appoint as13 magistrates14 and judges, to judge all the [section of the] people15 which resides in Transeuphrates, all those who are versed in the laws of your God; and 16־you and they16־ shall instruct whoever is not.' We are therefore not surprised to find that the first ground that our psalm names for praising YHWH is that he has rebuilt Jerusalem and gathered the outcasts of Israel (v. 2). Not surprisingly, it employs in this connection for 'to gather' the late verb kns (contrast the synonymous verbs in Is. 11: 12). We shall further see below that in v. 1 occurs the only biblical example of the late, secondary, root n'w/y. [Probably also a sign of lateness is the verb sibbah 'to praise' (v. 12), which, apart from the apparently early passage Ps. 63:4, occurs only in definitely 12 Reading ייוז־עם with others. נג I have already proposed this interpretation in my con tribution on biblical Aramaic to An Aramaic Handbook (Porta Linguarum Orientalium NS 10), ed. by Franz Rosen thai, Wiesbaden, 1967, Pt. 1/1, p. 22; Pt. 1/2, p. 30. 14 For the non-Aramaic and tautological שפטיך the LXX read ס פרין ; and despite Rudolph, ad loc., Joiion was doubtless right, in view of the context, in taking this in the sense of 'scholars, teachers'. 15 I.e. of the people Israel, referring back to v. 13. A tremendous gain in smoothness will, however, result if 'ammg is corrected in both passages to 'amm?h 'his people', referring in v. 13 to 'the God of Heaven' named in v. 12 and in v. 25 to 'your God' near the beginning of the verse. This is practically demanded in both instances by the analogy of 'his people' in Ezra 1: 3 referring to 'the God of Heaven' in v. 2. 16 Lit. 'you' (pi.). late ones. — Sbh 'to still (the raging of the waves)' is different.] As a late writer, our poet is heir to a long tradi tion, and it is not surprising that he should echo many of his predecessors. Although, as has just been pointed out, he expresses the notion of gather ing in v. 2 by a verb that is later than either of the two that are employed for this purpose in Is. 11: 12, he is obviously inspired by the latter passage.17 Rather intensive is his utilization of Ps. 33.18 It is, first of all, obvious that he has modeled his opening verse on that of Ps. 33, but we owe to Blau the discovery of just what he has done with the opening of Ps. 33.19 Blau points out that as a matter of fact our poet has utilized both Ps. 33: 1 and Ps. 135: 2, and has, in addition, given a new meaning to the נאוה of the former. In 33: 1 נאוה is the τ ־ feminine singular participle of the niphal of ,ww/y.20 In 147: 1 it is an infinitive piel (like זמו"ה in the same verse and like יסרה in Lev. 26: 18) of n'w/y.21 The former verse means, 'Acclaim YHWH, you righteous; it is fitting that the upright should give praise'; the latter, 'Praise Yah! For it is good to hymn our God, it is right to give beautiful praise'.22 17 Which I believe to be Isaian — Mordecai Kaplan Jubilee Volume II, New York, 1953, pp. 248-51 —and which there is in no case any reason for dating to the late post-exilic period. 18 It has no bearing on the present argument, but I observe in passing that in Ps. 33: 4 דבר is obviously miswritten for דרך. Cf. Deut. 32:4a-b (reproduced in Aramaic in Dan. 4: 34); Ps. 145:17; and for the parallelism, Prov. 8: 22 (where Dahood's interpretation of דרכו illustrates what I have characterized elsewhere as his use of Ugaritic as a misosopher's stone); Jer. 17: lOd; Hos. 12: 3b-c. Note also that the root ysr is employed much more often in connection with paths than with words. 19 J. Blau in A. Biram Jubilee Volume, Jerusalem 1956, p. 183 (Hebrew). 20 So rightly W. Baumgartner: Hebraisches undaramaisches Lexikon zum Alien Testament 3, first installment, 1967, p. 20a, following Bauer-Leander. 21 This root, which was destined to develop vigorously in Roman Hebrew, is evidently a secondary one, derived from the niphal of 'ww/y. 22 Lit. 'to make praise fitting'. — I regret that I cannot be equally enthusiastic about Blau's other two examples of 'inlaying with change of sense', but I have observed another clear instance myself in Job 9: 8. This verse, which reads נטה שמים לבדו ודורך על במתי־ים is a cento of one clause from Is. 44:24 and another from Micah 1:3, but there is no connection in thought between</page><page sequence="6">50 Η. L. GINSBERG And that 147:10-11 is a reworking — which is hardly an improvement22— of 33:16 surely re quires no proof. Other Psalms passages echoed in Ps. 147 are 81:17 (&gt;147: 14b) and 136:25a (&gt; 147: 9). But, as is implied by our including Ps. 147 in our series as 'Stage Five', its main source of in spiration is our 'Stage Four', or the Second Isaiah; though to be sure it neglects all the elements that 'Stage Four' took over from 'Stage Three' (just as 'Stage Three', we saw above, neglected much of what 'Stage Two' had taken over from 'Stage One'). First of all, then, our poet supplements his initial praise of YHWH as him who rebuilt Jerusalem and gathered the outcasts of Israel with a figure of speech for the comforting of Israel (v. 3), 'Who heals the broken-hearted and binds up their wounds'. This is of course reminiscent of the phrase 'to bind up the broken-hearted' in Is. 61: 3.24 That Ps. the two unless נטה is taken not, as in Is. 44: 24, in the sense of 'who spread out' but in that of 'who inclines'; cf. 2 Sam. 22: 10/ IPs. 18: 10; Ps. 144: 5. Even s לבדו remains otiose, unless it too means something different from what לבדי does in Is. 44: 24. One wishes one could justify translating לבדו 'to be his ramp'; cf. Tur Sinai, ad loc. 23 Surely 147's observation that those who worship YHWH and trust to his kindness are more acceptable to him than the valor of horses or the fleetness of men, is but a verschlimm besserung of 33's declaration that YHWH's providence avails those who worship and trust in him more than horses and armies avail a king or brawn avails a warrior. 24 As a matter of fact, our psalmist's text of Second Isaiah also exhibited the verb 'to heal' in connection with broken heartedness, but the passage in question has suffered mischief in oui Second Isaiah. I refer to Is. 57: 17c-19a. First 57:15 147:4 is parallel to Is. 40: 26c-d is obvious, but now it should be equally obvious that Ps. 147: 5 is inspired by Is. 40:26e (אמיץ כח) and by the final clause of v. 28 ibid. In Is. 54:12-13, note the words ושעריך...גבולך... שלום בניך; and compare Ps. 147:13 14a. But the most telling example of 'Stage Five"s dependence on 'Stage Four' is Ps. 147: 15-18. Here the psalmist states twice that YHWH sends his utterance or word to the earth, once with emphasis on the speed with which it obeys; in between are mentioned snow, frost and hail (some also find ice, reading something like מים יעמדו at the end of v. 17). It thus appears that the sole purpose for which YHWH sends down his word to the earth is to melt the snow etc. (v. 18a). This can only be due to the secondary character of our passage in relation to Is. 55: 10-11: 'For as the rain or snow that drops from heaven returns not there but soaks the earth and makes it bring forth vegetation, yielding seed for sowing and bread for eating, so is the word that issues from my mouth: it comes not back to me, its task undone, but executes what I purpose, achieves what I sent it to do (namely to redeem Israel, not to melt the snow!).' 17b should be read; for despite some obscurities in detail, its general sense can be understood tolerably well by the understanding. Once they have done so, they should have little difficulty in appreciating the following exegesis of vv. 17c-19a: 'But now that he (Israel) walks broken (rd. שבור) in the contrition of (rd. בדכא — or the like) his heart (cf. v. 15 end), I have noted his contrition (rd. דכאו) and I will heal him; I will revive him (rd. ואחיהו, cf. v. 15, end), as I mete out solace to him, and to his mourners heart ening (lit. 'the vigor [Eccl. 12: 1] of'), comforting words (rd. ניד שפתים cf. Job 16: 5).</page></plain_text>
