THE FOUNDERS OF LINEAGES AT COPAN AND OTHER MAYA SITES* Linda Scheie Art Department, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78723 Abstract Decipherments and interpretations presented by Peter Mathews and Bertold Riese a decade ago led to the identification of numbered-successor titles that list individual rulers according to their numerical position in a historical succession of kings. Work on the inscriptions of Copan has shown that the "counts of successors" there began with a single founding ancestor, who has been identified archaeologically. Since the rulers of other kingdoms calculated their descent from different founding ancestors, the evidence suggests that Maya kingdoms were ruled by lineages or dynasties of males who calculated their descent for a single anchoring ancestor, who was very probably a historical individual. Evidence from Naranjo also suggests that alternative descent lines were calculated from supernatural anchoring ancestors. The metaphorical term for these lineages was "spout-tree-house." All of the people in the lineage descending from these founders were called "sprouts," while the ruling patriarch was the ahau of the descent line. Peter Mathews (1975) first noted a pattern in the inscriptions of Yaxchilan in which the accessions of kings are accompanied by an ordinal number and one of the variants of the successor glyph. He suggested that these numbered-succession glyphs mark the numerical order of these accession events within the dynastic history of Yaxchilan. Following Mathews's suggestions, Riese (1984) summarized the distribution of these expressions at many different sites and discussed the larger set of succession glyphs that Thompson (1950:160-162) had earlier read as hel based on their appearance in the introductory glyph to distance numbers. Since Thompson's original proposal, many epigra phers, including Riese (1984), have taken the presence of a ka phonetic complement as evidence for a reading of ts'ak reading. Since these number + ts'ak compounds occur in name phrases, Riese (1984) following Mathews's earlier interpretation proposed that numbers referred to a succession of rulers at the site. Subsequent investigation has shown that these numbered ts'ak titles are the Classic-period prototype to identical ts'ak count of rulers used in the Paxbolon papers of the Acalan Chontal (Smailus 1975). Most epigraphers now interpret them as titles recording the count "royal succession or change of rul ers." In other words, these titles, as originally suggested by Mathews, establish a ruler's numerical position in the histori cal sequence of kings at each site. As Riese (1984) observed, Co pan, which has the greatest number of these titles, provides the best set of data to test the interpretation. The critical monument in reconstructing the dynastic history of Copan is Altar Q, which depicts 16 rulers of Copan seated *The glyphic conventions employed in this paper follow a system proposed by George Stuart and applied by the editors. The author prefers another orthography now in use among students of modern Maya languages. in order around its four sides (Figure l).1 Lounsbury (1978), who first correctly analyzed the substitution patterns in the name of the protagonist of this text, Yax Pac, included a kuk-mo glyph among his names. Subsequent research by Stuart and Scheie (1986b) identified that name as Yax Kuk Mo and asso ciated it with the figure who faces Yax Pac on Altar Q. Stuart (1985) reanalyzed the dates on Altar Q and other related mon uments and placed them at the Long Count positions listed in Table 1. Stuart's analysis was confirmed when later excavations discovered a near-contemporary monument (Fash et al. 1992) inside Structure 10L-26 that associated Yax Kuk Mo's name with 9.0.0.0.0. The use of the Yax Kuk Mo name with the numbered ts'ak titles is an important key to the function and meaning of this title in Classic Maya inscriptions. Stela 15, the 9.4.10.0.0 mon ument of Waterlily-Jaguar, has the earliest known example (Fig ure 2a). Yax Kuk Mo occurs on Side G-H with the date 13 Kayab and the Calendar Round 8 Ahau 13 Ceh, with both dates noted as period endings. The only major period endings within the appropriate time frame to fall on 13 Kayab and 8 Ahau 13 Ceh are 8.19.0.0.0 and 9.0.0.0.0, dates within the range of those on Altar Q and Stela J. The opposite side records the protago nist's name, Waterlily Jaguar, followed by "seventh successor" and a series of titles concluding with the name Yax Kuk Mo. 1 The exact history of this hypothesis is uncertain to me since it has not been completely published. According to my understanding, Ber thold Riese first proposed this interpretation during his work in the Proyecto Arqueológico Copan (PAC). He recognized the names of the sixteenth, fifteenth, thirteenth, and twelfth successors, identifying the last by associating his long reign with the fi\e-katun glyph on which the twelfth figure sits. To my knowledge, he has not published his ideas, but they have instead been distributed and used by other members of PAC and now are featured in the Copan museum. 135</page><page sequence="2">136 Scheie Figure 1.

Stuart 1985. The same name, Waterlily-Jaguar, appears under the seventh figure on Altar Q (Figure 1). This stela (Scheie and Stuart 1986a), then, names the seventh ruler on Altar Q as "the sev enth successor of Ahau Kin, west batab, Mah Kinah Yax Kuk Mo." We have not yet found monuments of the eight and ninth successors, and the tenth successor (Stela 9) did not use this suc cessor title on his surviving monument. The eleventh successor, however, did use a ts'ak title on Stela P, dated at 9.9.0.0.0. This ruler, Budz Chan (Scheie and Stuart 1986b), named himself "the successor of [Mah Kinah] Yax Kuk Mo, [Copan Blood Lord], west batab" (Figure 2b). Confusing the issue is the use of the number 12 with a ts'ak glyph on Stela 7, a problem2 that may be mitigated by the fact that the name following the title is not the expected Yax Kuk Mo (Figure 2d). Either BuJz Chan was counting the succession from a different person, or this is a dif ferent kind of titular reference. The twelfth ruler, Smoke Imix God K, used the successor ti tle frequently. On Stela 19, he named himself "the twelfth suc cessor of Kinich Ahau, Mah Kinah Yax Kuk Mo, west kolom-te" (Stuart et al. 1989) (Figure 2c). On Stela 13, he again used the twelfth successor name, but he followed it with the phonetic variant of the batab title (Figure 2e). On Stela 12 (Fig ure 2f), he used an u cab expression between his name and that 2 While I still do not have an explanation for the reference on Stela 12, I suspect it may be related to ox ahal, an expression that occurs in the names of ballcourts at Copan, Yaxchilan, Naranjo, and Tonina. On Stela P, Budz Chan calls himself ox ahal ahaw, while Stela 7 has "12 ts'ak ox-ahal." The two passages seem to be related. Ahal has two mean ings that can be documented in both the inscriptions and dictionary sources. In Yukatek, ah is the verb for "to manifest" and "to be real ized." In Cholti, a sixteenth-century Cholan language, ahal is glossed as veneer, "to conquer," "to defeat." Nikolai Grube and Jorge Orejel (personal communication 1990) have independently suggested that "three-conquests-stair" is a particularly relevant translation of ox-ahal eb, since the glyph and the places it designates are consistently associ ated with ballcourts, with victory monuments, and with the sacrifice of captives.</page><page sequence="3">Lineages at Copan and other Maya sites I 37 Figure 3. Copan texts from (a) Stela 10, (b) Stela B, (c) Stela E, (d) altar of Stela N, (e) reviewing stand of Temple 11, (f) Stela 24 (drawing by Da vid Stuart). of Yax Kuk Mo. Most epigraphers take this u cab phrase to function as a statement of authority or agency, so that he was saying that his action is done by the authority of the founder. The most unusual ts'ak reference occurs on Stela 10 (Fig ure 3a). The particular passage of concern records the action of Smoke Imix God K on the occasion of the katun ending 9.11.0.0.0. His name phrase includes its standard components as well as the expected emblem glyph title. After two badly eroded glyphs, the text continues with another name including "ch'ahom [scatterer], west batab, the tenth successor of Kinich Yax Kuk Mo," title. If the successor title is a reference to Smoke Imix God K, then there is an error of two in the number. How ever, there may be another explanation for the discrepancy. The remaining part of the glyph at H7 depicts an animal head with a T74 ma phonetic complement. On Step 6 of the Hieroglyphic Stairway, Smoke Imix God K is named as the child of a male with a jaguar name with the same phonetic complement (Block 17). The tenth successor on Altar Q and Step 9 has a jaguar name. Since Smoke Imix biologically cannot be the child of the tenth successor, I assume the glyph between these two names is not a parentage glyph.3 The next Copan king, 18 Rabbit, only recorded his succes sor number on one monument, Stela B (Figure 3b). This exam ple, however, does not include the name of the founder. Instead the text has "13 successions" followed by the cross-batons title and then his personal name and the emblem glyph. This same crossed-batons title appears in Yax Kuk Mo's name on Stela 12 (Figure 3a). This usage seems to parallel the record on Stela 13 of Smoke Imix God K as "the twelfth successor of the batab," by replacing the name of the founding ancestor by a title or term that means the same thing. David Stuart and I (Stuart and Scheie 1986a) originally suggested that this glyph is some ref erence to "founder," a hypothesis that will be discussed later. We have not yet recovered any text commissioned by the next ruler, Smoke Monkey, but he was named by his successor on the base of Stela N and the Hieroglyphic Stairway. The north south columns on the Stela N base record his accession and his status as the fourteenth successor of the "holy Copan lord" and a name glyph that began with yax (Figure 3d). I think the last two glyphs once named Yax Kuk Mo. Smoke Monkey's posi tion in the dynasty is confirmed on the Hieroglyphic Stairway. Stuart's (Stuart and Scheie 1986a) brilliant analysis of the dis rupted steps recording his accession reconstructed the phrase "the fourteenth successor of Mah Kina Yax Kuk Mo." The fifteenth ruler, Smoke Shell, also was recorded by his suc cessor with a numbered ts'ak title on the south reviewing stand of Temple 11. The final phrase in this text includes a ballgame glyph followed by Yax Pac's name, which concludes with "six teenth successor" and the crossed-batons title (Figure 3d). This phrase is immediately followed by "15 successors" and the name Smoke Shell. Thus, we have the seventh figure and the eleventh through the sixteenth figures on Altar Q associated with a number that matches their position in the succession list. The tenth may have a similar reference on Stela 10 and the majority are named as the "successors of Mah Kinah Yax Kuk Mo," who is the first figure on Altar Q. When his name does not appear, we have, instead, the crossed-batons title or, as on Stela 13, a title of rulers. With only a few exceptions, the numbered ts'ak titles at Co pan are counted from Yax Kuk Mo, the first figure on Altar Q, but Copan's inscriptions also make it clear that he was not the first king of that polity. On Stela E, Yax Kuk Mo was named 3 David Stuart and I have rejected the possibility that Smoke Imix God K was the child of the tenth successor. Both Block 17 of Step 9 on the Hieroglyphic Stairs and Stela 10 include a glyph resembling a jag uar head in the name of Smoke Imix God K's father, who is also named as the tenth successor on Stela 10. However, the eleventh successor, Budz Chan, reigned for nearly 50 years. If Smoke Imix God K and Budz Chan were brothers, they would had to have been born before the death of the father. Since Budz Chan reigned for 50 years, that is the minimum age we can calculate for Smoke Imix God K at his succession. However, Smoke Imix God K reigned for 67 years, giving him, in this scenario, a minimum age of 117 years. Not only is this biologically unfeasible, but he was only a ñve-katun lord, or between 80 and 100 tuns old at his death.</page><page sequence="4">138 Scheie as the "successor of Smoke Codex God K" (Figure 3c)4 and on Stela 1, Smoke Imix God K named a king at the date 8.6.0.0.0 whose name does not correspond to any of those in successor phrases or on Altar Q. And finally, Stela 24, dated to 9.2.10.0.0, records a ruler named as the first to accede at Co pan (Figure 3f). The text on the rear apparently is the remain der of a list of accessions which were, like those at Yaxchilan, ordered by numbered succession glyphs preceding an accession verb. The only surviving record from this list uses the u na (first) in the successor construction identified by Mathews (1975) at Yaxchilan.5 At Copan the verb that follows it is very rare with its only other occurrence being in the accession phrase of Curl Snout on Tikal Stela 31. Although the Copan name is badly eroded, it includes a head variant of the etz'nab flint sign, and it is clearly not Yax Kuk Mo.6 Yax Kuk Mo was, then, the founder of the lineage or dynasty to which his 15 successors be longed. FOUNDERS AT OTHER SITES Yaxchilan In his study of Yaxchilan Lintels 35, 37, and 45, Mathews (1975) was able to identify Rulers 5-10. The seventh in the series he as sociated with initial series date and an event recorded on Lin tel 21 by the later Bird Jaguar. In 1983, the first lintel in the series was discovered by Roberto Garcia Moll (see Wilkerson 1985:540), thus completing the list with the first through the fourth rulers (Figure 4a). The text begins with the same u na compound we saw on Copan Stela 24 and the Early Classic variant of the T700 accession verb. Given the name Progenitor Jaguar by National Geographic and Yat Balam by Scheie and Freidel (1990), the name of this first king of Yaxchilan has a pe nis and testicles sign, preceded by the phonetic sign yo, set over the head of a jaguar. The Yaxchilan emblem glyph completes the name. The name of the seventh successor as it appears on Lintel 21 (Figure 4b), has "the seventh successor of" expression followed by a title that also occurs in successor phrases at Copan also in the context of very early rulers (see Copan Stelae 4 and 1). Since the final block of this passage contains the double emblem glyph of Yaxchilan, we may assume that the glyph preceding it is a name, consisting here of a jaguar holding a stone in his hand combined with a to prefix and a ti suffix. When Stuart and I ex amined this glyph in 1986, we recognized it as the name of the founder, Yat Balam. Figure 4. (a) Yaxchilan lintel, (b) Yaxchilan Lintel 21, (c) sky-penis titles from Copan and Yaxchilan. The genital sign in Yat-Balam's name occurs frequently in the title prominent in Yax Pac's name at Copan. In that context, the penis glyph is always preceded by chart (either "sky" or "snake"), and it may be accompanied by phonetic complements, princi pally T115 yo and/or T44 to as prefixes, and T59 or T102, both ti or ta, as a suffix. This penis sign and its complements are of ten replaced by a portrait of the god Chac holding a cauac glyph or a quatrefoil cartouche in its hand (Figure 4c). The name on Lintel 21 uses this substitution to write the founder's name. It has the jaguar in place of Chac holding the stone, complete with the to prefix and ti suffix. Thus, Lintel 21 names the Yaxchi lan ruler Moon Skull as "the seventh successor of Penis Jaguar," in agreement with the lineage sequence recorded on the series of Early Classic lintels. Tikal At Tikal, the numbered ts'ak titles were used from Early Clas sic through Late Classic times. In Ruler B's accession statement on Stela 5, his name is followed by "the twenty-seventh succes sor of" and a name composed of yax, a bamboo cage (either moch [Lounsbury and Coe 1968] or ch'ak-te [Grube, personal communication 1990]), and a xoc monster head (Figure 5a). On Stela 22, this same Yax Moch Xoc's name reappears in Ruler C's name preceding "the twenty-ninth successor of" (Figure 5b). The founder's name also appears on the Temple of Inscriptions at 04, in what appears to be the name of Ruler B and in a con text of parentage. The successor title does not survive, but I pre sume it was once there. Stela 11, the late dated monument of Tikal has a ruler who carried the same name as Ruler A, a phrase reading "Hasau Can Kawil." His name phrase (Figure 5f) includes a badly eroded successor phrase including a number that appears to be thirty first, thirty-second, or thirty-third. The founder's name is re placed by the same crossed-batons glyph used by 18 Rabbit at Copan. No numbered succession title survives for Ruler A, who pre sumably was the twenty-sixth successor, nor do we have a 4David Stuart first noted that the glyph at CI 1 includes a mah kina title followed by yax, phonetic k'u-k'u, and phonetic mo-o. This name is followed by the successor glyph and a name composed of a smoke sign, the picture of a codex, and the portrait head of God K. From sub stitutions in Smoke Imix God K's name on Stela 12 and in Glyph F, this codex glyph can be identified as equivalent to T128. The name is thus very close to the ancestor named by Smoke Imix God K on Stela 12 and the other names at Copan that have smoke and T128 as components. 51 first noticed the use of na as "first" in the Temple of Inscriptions at Palenque where it is used with the ordinally numbered katuns of Pakal's reign (Scheie 1975). Na also occurs in Glyph C as the numbered of the first lunation of the lunar semester. In various forms, na occurs in Cholan languages as one of the terms for "first." 6 See Scheie and Grube (1990) for an alternative reading of Stela 24 that interprets the first collocation as the first "after" the founder and thus the second in the succession. This alternative is still a tentative in terpretation, but it allows for Stela 24 to fall in the known sequence.</page><page sequence="5">Lineages at Copan and other Maya sites 139 Figure 5. Tikal texts from (a) Stela 5, (b) Stela 22, (c) Stela 17, (d) plate from Burial 195, (e) Stela 12, (f) Stela 11. twenty-eighth successor title in the surviving inscriptions of Ti kal. To find another example we must go to inscriptions from before Tikal's hiatus. In Tomb 195, the ruler whose name was recorded on the stucco vessel (MT 217) titled himself "the twenty-second successor of," but, instead of the founder's name, he used ahau in a statement parallel to the use of the batab ti tle on Copan Stela 13 (Figure 5c). His predecessor, Double Bird, is named on Stela 17 as "the twenty-first successor of Yax Moch Xoc" (Figure 5d). The earliest Tikal example of the title is a bit problematic. On a black cache vessel from the central Acropolis (MT 140), the rim text (Figure 6a) begins with a standard phrase record ing the dedication of a holy house, identified by Peter Harrison (personal communication 1989) as Structure 5D-87, a palace in the Central Acropolis. The man who dedicated this building, Great Jaguar Paw, included the phrase "nine successor lord" and "Moch Xoc" in his name phrase. If this man was the same Great Jaguar Paw named on Stela 31 at 8.17.0.0.0, the number is approximately right; a looted pot (Robiscek and Hales 1981 ¡Figure 76a) records Stormy Sky, the protagonist of Stela 31, with an "eleventh successor" phrase. The same text records an unknown king who may also occur on Stela 8 as the thir teenth successor; and Jaguar Paw Skull, the protagonist of Ste lae 3, 15, and 27 and the son of Kan Boar, as the fourteenth successor (Figure 6b). Kan Boar appears to have been the twelfth successor but I can discern no clear number in his name phrase. The text on Stela 31 seems to support this succession se quence, for it records one ruler, Curl Snout, between Great Jag uar Paw and Stormy Sky, making the earlier ruler the ninth successor if Stormy Sky was the eleventh. There are two problems with this analysis. MT 140 includes T168, ahau, with the successor glyph, and these nine-successor lord glyphs appears at many sites without reference to the numeri cal position of the ruler in the lineage history.7 Furthermore, the Moch Xoc without the yax sign occurs with Great Jaguar Paw's name, not only on MT 140, but on Stela 39 (Figure 6c).8 Here the Moch Xoc name follows the Jaguar Paw head variant without an intervening ts'ak in the name. In fact, I suspect the context is a parentage statement for the protagonist of the mon ument, a man named Skull, who apparently never ruled. Jag uar Paw's full name phrase may have included this Moch Xoc glyph, suggesting that the yax sign must be present in order to designate the founder's name. At present, an unassailable ar gument cannot be made, but I accept the text of MT 140 as a reference to Great Jaguar Paw as the "ninth successor of lord Moch Xoc." Stormy Sky also honored the founder but in another way. On Stela 31, the image depicts Stormy Sky lifting up a flint shield war headdress in his accession rites (Figure 6d). Among the head regalia he already wears is a round earflare surmounted by a fish-featured dragon that has a bamboo cage attached. The expected yax sign appears as the serrated contour of the mon ster's nose. Thus, Stormy Sky carries the name of the founder as part of his array of symbols. On Stela 29, the same shape is seen attached to the earflare of the floating ancestor figure and, perhaps, of the protagonist. Both men wore the name of the founder in their headdress.9 There may be one more numbered successor title at Tikal, but its identification is less certain than other examples. Column D of Stela 12 (Figure 5e) begins with the verb for male blood letting (Mathews 1986), read yah, "to wound in a body part," by Fahsen and Scheie (1991). The text continues with ts'apah u te tun, "erected the stela of." Although the name of the protag onist is damaged, the last surviving glyph has the number 19 pre ceding kin and akbal signs surmounting an animal head. The kin-akbal signs constitute a paired opposition of the kind that is known to replace the standard ts'ak sign in distance number introductory glyphs. The concept of change is represented by this opposition (Scheie 1979) and by the replacement by one thing by its opposite. If the animal head is the head variant of T21 or perhaps T25, then this glyph is one of the numbered suc cessor titles using a paired opposition to replace T573. Nineteen 7Nikolai Grube and David Stuart have suggested that this nine form reads bolon ts'akob and is the Classic version of one of God's names. This suggestion seems plausible to me. 8This newly found stela has a "completion of ?? katuns" sign on it, which I had taken to be 17 katuns or 8.17.0.0.0, as had most other epig raphers who had seen drawings or photos. However, using a cast at the National Museum in Guatemala City, Federico Fahsen convinced me the number is more likely to read 19 katuns for 8.19.0.0.0. In the text above the date, Great Jaguar Paw's name is followed by a child-of mother glyph and the name of a woman. Since the text is missing the upper part, it is just as likely that Great Jaguar Paw appears in a state ment naming the parentage of the protagonist as that he is himself the protagonist. Thus, the 8.19.0.0.0 date is acceptable for the monument. 9 David Stuart first noted the appearance of the founder's glyph on Stela 31, and Stephen Houston suggested that the same detail might be present on Stela 29.</page><page sequence="6">140 Scheie Figure 6. Tikal texts from (a) vase from Structure 5D-87, (b) vase with successor list, (c) Stela 39, (d) detail of Stela 31. is an appropriate number for the protagonist of this monument, Curl Head. He is associated with the dates 9.4.13.0.0 (Stela 12), 9.5.4.2.8, and 9.5.4.5.16 (Stela 10). The twenty-first successor on Stela 17 appears with 9.5.3.9.15 and 9.6.3.9.15. If the ear lier of these two dates corresponded to a pre-accession event, then the dates of the two rulers are separated by 20 years, a span appropriate to a difference of two in their numerical order of succession. Naranjo At Naranjo, the successor numbers are high like those of Tikal, but apparently for a different reason. On Altar 1 (Figure 7a), the text begins with a T168-518 ahauyan accession event which took place on 12 Oc 18 Kankin, 2.13.13.7.11.4 or 21,159 years before a bloodletting on 7.4.17.0.14 (January 21, —257). The god-actor of the mythological event is named with a zero sign prefixed to a square-nosed beastie. Mathews (1977) first noted that this same god with an equally long distance number is linked to Pakal's accession at Palenque, thus proving that this mythology was not just a local invention. Later on Altar 1, when the chronology is brought up to the time of the protago nist, he is named (Figure 7b) as "the thirty-fifth successor of" this god, as well as "the successor of" a cruller-eyed jaguar god who is one of the gods who paddle the canoe of life on the bones from Tikal Burial 116. Smoke Squirrel, who acceded to office almost a hundred years after the Altar 1 ruler, names himself the thirty-eighth successor of the same god (Figure 7c). The ad dition of only three numbers in 100 years of history fits also the unfortunate history of Naranjo, for it was conquered by Caracol around 9.10.10.0.0. For 40 years, no monuments were erected, and a local king may not have ruled. Naranjo may also have kept a different count of successions from a human ancestor. On Altar 1, the ruler who is called the "thirty-fifth successor of Zero Beastie," also included an "eight (or nine) ts'ak ahaw" in his name (Figure 7d). The same title re curs with his name on Stela 38. As with the Tikal example I dis cussed earlier, this ninth successor lord may not refer to this ruler's position in the dynasty. However, the parentage state ment at the end of Altar 1 records his father with a "seven ts'ak ahaw" title (Figure 7e). Since there is a change in the numbers, the scribe may indeed be referring to the ninth and seventh suc cessors of the Naranjo dynasty. And at Tikal, we have the ex ample from Burial 195 of "twenty-first successor" preceding</page><page sequence="7">Lineages at Copan and other Maya sites Figure 7. (a-b) Naranjo Altar 1, (c) Naranjo Stela 24, (d-e) Naranjo Stela 1, (f) Quirigua Stela ]. a haw in its anthropomorphic head variant. Since the T168 vari ant of ahaw (Lounsbury 1973) regularly precedes main signs in emblem glyphs and numbered katun titles that record the age of Maya lords, the same order may be used here. If this is the correct interpretation, the Altar 1 scribe has deliberately not used the name of the human founder in order to emphasize the divine founder. Quirigua At Quirigua, Two-Legged Sky (Cauac Sky) is named on Stelae F and J as "the fourteenth successor" (Figure 7f), but the cross batons title is used rather than the name of the founder (Fig ure 7f). Following initial ideas proposed by Andrea Stone (1986), I showed that this succession was counted from Yax Kuk Mo, an interpretation that was confirmed in the field at Zoo morph P in 1991 by Nikolai Grube, Federico Fahsen, and me (Scheie 1989a). Thus, we now have clear evidence that Quirigua and Copan were ruled by branches of the same lineage. THE FOUNDER'S GLYPH In our first work with these inscriptions, Stuart and I (Scheie 1986; Stuart and Scheie 1986a) identified a glyph that substi tuted for the name of the founder in a manner suggesting that it was a term for founder. Later, Stuart noted that this sign oc curred as part of the architectural decoration of a building at Río Amarillo, a subsidiary site near Copan, and I commented on the occurrence of the founder's glyph in the Altar Q follow ing the T670 glyph in a context suggesting that it recorded the founding event for Yax Kuk Mo (Scheie 1989b). The first of these events (Figure 8a) reads u ch'am k'awil, "founder" ("he took or received the founder-object") and the second reads tal, "founder" ("he came to the founder's object"). Thus, the founder glyph seems to refer to some kind of object taken in a ritual and to a location of some sort. Tikal gives one more clue. In 1986, David Stuart (personal communication) realized that the name on MT 35 is a phonetic variant of Curl Snout's name (Figure 8b). Following this clue, I found the date 4 Cib 14 Ceh fell on 8.17.2.3.16, only 261 days before the date of accession recorded on Stela 4. The event is recorded with the ok glyph, which in Yucatec can mean "foot" as well as "to enter" and "to become." The location or state into which Curl Snout entered is recorded by the founder's glyph. The founder's glyph itself consists of a pair of bound sticks crossed into an X-shape with a small face resting between the upper arms. Attached to this sign are T87 te and T4 na, giving the two final sounds as te na (Figure 8c). The upper sign eluded decipherment until the 1991 season of excavation of the Tulane project under the direction of E. Wyllys Andrews. Under the supervision of Barbara Fash, Daniela Epstein studied the archi tectural sculpture from Structure 33, and, after seeing Epstein's reconstruction of the glyphs from the upper frieze, I realized that they included a substitution pattern critical to the reading of the founder glyph. The glyph on Structure 33 consisted of T4 na prefixed to the crossed-sticks sign in the founder glyph. In some examples, the expected funny face appears over the crossed sticks (Figure 8d), but in others, the face is replaced by the double eyes that occur as a substitute for the rat in the rodent-bone glyph. Nikolai Grube and David Stuart (1987) and William Ringle (1988) have shown the elements of this glyphic title read ch'ok, meaning "unripe," "young," and, in Cholan, "sprout." As they have noted, this title, which I translate as "sprout," occurs with young people and with adults who are not the head of a lineage. Although the eyes or rat head alone usually require T110 ko to complete the word ch'ok, but there is good evidence for the full reading at Copan in a title read by Grube (Grube and Scheie 1991) as chan ch'ok tzuk, "four sprout partitions," a reference to the four divisions of the kingdom of Copan. Grube has shown that the full kankin sign in this title occurs both with and without a ki phonetic complement, so we are reasonably sure that the gourd sign was logographic tzuk, although it was pho netic tsu. In several of these titles, the rat head and the eyes without the ko sign stand for the full ch'ok glyph. I conclude from this that they were either logographically ch'ok or that the familiar context allowed the use of abbreviated spelling. In ei</page><page sequence="8">142 Scheie Figure 8. (a) Copan Altar Q, (b) Ti kal MT 35, (c) founder glyphs from Copan and Quirigua, (d) glyph from Copan Structure 33, (e) glyphs from Copan Structure 33. ther case, the substitution gives a reading of ch'ok-te-na or "sprout-tree-house" for the founder glyph. Grube and Scheie (1991) recognized the appropriateness of this metaphor as soon as the reading became clear. For exam ple, the modern Maya of Santiago Atitlan (Carlsen and Prechtel 1991) believe in a great tree, called mother-father, that existed at the beginning of the world. All things —human, animal, and inanimate — came into existence as the fruit of this tree. As the fruit ripened, it fell to the earth to give rise to sprouts that even tually mature and crowded out the parent tree, which died and now exists as a stump at the center of the cosmos. Parallel Mix tec sources depict the Tree of Apoala splitting open to give birth to human beings. Trees in the form of central poles, crosses, and the world trees have been central to Maya thought for 3,000 years (Vogt 1988; Freidel et al. 1992). Describing a dynasty or a lineage as "sprout-tree-house" is entirely consonant with this tradition and in keeping with the use of sprout as the term for the members of a lineage. Most interestingly, the apparition that appears from the mouth of the vision serpent on Lintel 25 of Yaxchilan is identified as the ch'ok-te-na-wi,10 "sprout-tree house-root," thus characterizing the founder as the root of the tree. Furthermore, ch'ok-te-na fits very well with the contexts in which the founder glyph occurs at Copan. The expression, "nn ts'ak ch'ok-te-na"is "nth successor in the sprout-tree-house." Yax Kuk Mo's grasping of kawil was simply the taking of a physical statue symbolizing the ch'ok-te-na. Three days later, he "arrived into the sprout-tree-house" itself. Curl Snout of Ti kal entered into the sprout-tree-house either with his birth or more likely with his designation as heir. SUMMARY The numbered succession titles are counts from particular in dividuals whose names may be replaced by a title, such as ahaw or batab or by the glyph reading "sprout-tree-house." At Co pan and Yaxchilan, these persons were the first kings in glyphi cally or iconographically recorded successor lists: at Copan, the named ancestor is the first figure in a portrait row of 16 succes sors; and, at Yaxchilan, he was the first to be seated as king. At Copan, however, the founder was not the first king of the site, for earlier kings are named and the founder himself was re corded as the successor of yet another ruler who was not in cluded in the successor count. These data lead to the conclusion that the successor count is from a founder and enumerates a succession of people descended from that founder. This social entity, which included people calculating their descent from the same founder, was called a sprout-tree-house. All the people who were part of the lineage were sprouts of that tree. At most sites, the founder was human and lived within historical time, but at Naranjo at least one of the counts was from a mytholog ical ancestor who acceded before the beginning of this era (4 Ahau 8 Cumku). Since the same god was used in a compa rable context at Palenque, this concept of divine ancestor was shared by many sites, although most chose to count from a his torical ancestor. Although the successor lists do not provide ir refutable evidence as to the kind of kinship system used by the Classic Maya, they do demonstrate that Maya rulership of the Classic period was based on lineage. 10Nikolai Grube has suggested to me that the sign attached to this example at Yaxchilan corresponds to the lancet held in the woman pro tagonist's bowl. On the other hand, I think the sign corresponds instead to the nose of a mountain monster set carved on the palanquin depicted on Tikal Temple 4, Lintel 4. The upper two mountain mon sters have ts'ak, "partition," heads on their noses, while the two lower ones have the same leaflike sign as the Yaxchilan glyph. Since the word for "mountain" is witz, I think the best interpretation of the Tikal ex ample is that the sign is wi and that it functions as a phonetic comple ment for witz. Wi is also the Cholan root for "root" and "origin."</page><page sequence="9">Lineages at Copan and other Maya sites 143 RESUMEN Este artículo reporta el descubrimiento de referencias glíficas a los fun dadores de los linaje reales de Copan y otros sitios mayas, incluyendo Yaxchilan, Tikal, Naranjo y Quirigua. Los descendientes de un fundador particular pertenecían a una entidad social llamada "Casa del Retoño de Arbol"; a su vez, los miembros del linaje se describían a sí mismos como "retoños" del árbol. En conjunto con otros datos, esta investiga ción demuestra que durante el período clásico, el señorío estaba basado en el concepto del linaje. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This paper was first circulated in 1986 as Copan Note 8 and presented publicly for the first time at the Primer Simposio Mundial sobre Epigrafía Maya in Guatemala City in August 1986.1 wish to acknowledge David Stuart's central contribution to the process that led to the decipherments described in the original note. During the summer of 1986, he and I en gaged in a remarkable collaboration that resulted in the first 17 Copan Notes and much of the dynastic history of that site as we now under stand it. In addition, Nikolai Grube (1988) published research that had come to almost identical results about the same inscriptions. We did not know about our parallel research until after the appearance of the Co pan Note. He has become an active partner in subsequent work espe cially concerning the Quirigua material presented here and in the decipherment of the founder's glyphs. Finally, I wish to thank E. Wyllys Andrews V and Barbara Fash for allowing me to use a newly discov ered glyph from their collaborative work. A substitution in this glyph proved critical to the decipherment of the founder's glyph.
