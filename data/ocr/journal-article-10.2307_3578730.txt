D., Jr. Chromosome Damage in Lymphocytes from Women Irradiated for Benign and Malignant Gynecological Disease. Radiat. Res. 139, 40-46 (1994). Excess leukemias have occurred after partial-body radiother- apy for cervical cancer and benign gynecological disease (BGD). However, the level of risk is nearly the same in both groups, about twofold, despite a tenfold difference in average dose to active bone marrow (8 Gy vs 0.7 Gy, respectively). High-dose cell killing has been postulated as one explanation for this apparent inconsistency. To examine whether chromosome aberration rates observed in lymphocytes many years after exposure might serve as population markers of cancer risk, blood samples were taken from 60 women treated for BGD (34 with radiation) and cytoge- netic data compared with previous results from 96 women irradi- ated for cervical cancer. Remarkably, the rate of stable aberra- tions, which reflects nonlethal damage in surviving stem cells, was only slightly higher among the cancer patients. Thus the lower-dose regimens to treat benign disorders resulted in much higher aberration yields per unit dose than those for cervical can- cer. Assuming that the fraction of cytogenetically aberrant stem cells that survive radiotherapy contributes to the leukemogenic process, these data are then consistent with the epidemiological observations of comparable overall leukemia risks seen in these two irradiated populations. Accordingly, for patient populations given partial-body radiotherapy, stable aberrations at a long time after exposure appear to serve as biomarkers of effective risk rather than as biomarkers of radiation dose received. INTRODUCTION Radiation-induced chromosome aberrations of the sym- metrical (i.e. stable) type may be detected in cultured lym- phocytes several decades after persons received partial- body exposures, and within several irradiated cohorts of patients, stable aberration frequencies have a relationship with radiation dose (1, 2). We previously postulated that these persistent chromosomal rearrangements in peripheral T lymphocytes may be useful as surrogate biomarkers that gauge the relative levels of genetic damage sustained by the surviving fraction of irradiated hematopoietic stem cells (3). Because it is these same stem cells that give rise to leukemia, and because chromosomal rearrangements are relevant to and play a role in leukemogenesis, we thought that the frequencies of radiation-induced chromosome aberrations observed many years after exposure would be correlated positively with the risk for radiation-induced leukemia in populations of exposed persons. Women irradi- ated for benign and malignant disease were studied because similar twofold risks of leukemia have been reported despite a difference of over tenfold in dose (4-8). To determine whether the levels of persistent radiation- induced chromosome aberrations in lymphocytes correlate with leukemia risk in women who received localized radio- therapy to the pelvis, we compared aberration rates in women with benign gynecological disease (BGD) who were irradiated more than 40 years ago with data for cervical can- cer patients exposed more than 20 years ago. Given the sim- ilar leukemia risks reported for the two cohorts, the propor- tion of lymphocytes with chromosome aberrations should be similar in both groups of women in spite of the fact that they received widely disparate average radiation doses to the bone marrow (0.7 Gy vs 8 Gy). Because radiation risks are 1To whom correspondence should be addressed at Radiation Epi- demiology Branch, EPN 408, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892. 0033-7587/94 $5.00 ?1994 by Radiation Research Society.

However, for pelvic irradiation, risk does not appear to be related to dose in a simple linear manner. We considered it of interest to learn whether persistent cytogenetic aberrations are more related to dose or to risk. We report here on cytogenetic findings in 34 women irradiated for BGD and 26 nonirradiated com- parison subjects. These data are compared with our earlier findings in lymphocyte cultures from 96 irradiated and 26 nonirradiated cervical cancer patients (1). MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Population Women irradiated for benign gynecological disease or treated with other modalities for similar conditions between 1925-1960 at either of two medical centers located in the Northeast [Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) and Rhode Island Hospital] were eligible for study if they lived within driving distance of either of these two centers. Three hundred women (195 irradiated, 105 nonirradiated) were approached to participate in the study, and 121 (62%) irradiated and 57 (54%) nonirra- diated subjects refused. Many subjects were elderly and hesitant to trav- el, so it was decided to send nurses to the subjects' homes to draw blood from qualifying subjects (i.e. women who had never been diagnosed with cancer, or received any chemotherapy or radiotherapy for other than BGD, or undergone any diagnostic radiation procedure other than dental or chest X rays). At the time of screening, 32 (16.4%) irradiated and 15 (14.3%) nonirradiated subjects were determined to be ineligible for the study. Between December 1987 and March 1990, blood samples were obtained from a total of 42 irradiated and 33 nonirradiated women. All women provided written consent. The majority of the irradiated BGD patients were treated with only radium implants. The treatment typically consisted of radium capsules inserted into the uterine cavity or cervical canal for between 12 and 24 h (4). In addition to radium, six subjects (two from Rhode Island and four from RPCI) also received external-beam irradiation which involved a sin- gle given dose of 6 Gy of orthovoltage X rays (200 kVp, 0.9 mm Cu HVL) to one central anterior field (25 x 20 cm). In some instances, a second dose of 6 Gy to one central posterior field was given the following day. Basic patient and treatment data had been collected several years earlier as part of a large mortality cohort study of BGD patients (4, 5, 9). Individual radiotherapy records were reviewed by a medical physicist at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Physics Department. Dosimetry for the BGD subjects was calculated using the same methodology described previously for cervical cancer patients (10). An algorithm had been developed, based on measurements on anthropomorphic and water phantoms, to estimate the average dose to the active bone marrow for each subject. The dose to the total bone marrow averaged over the entire body was computed as the sum of the doses to each of 14 individual com- partments multiplied by the proportion of active bone marrow assumed to be contained in that compartment (11). For the 34 irradiated subjects in the cytogenetic study, the average bone marrow dose was 0.74 Gy (range: 0.13-1.60 Gy), 0.66 Gy for radium-treated patients and 1.12 Gy for those also treated with external-beam radiation. For the nonirradiat- ed subjects, treatment usually consisted of a dilatation and curettage. Similar eligibility criteria had been used when the 96 irradiated and 26 nonirradiated cervical cancer patients were recruited for cytogenetic studies (1). Radiotherapy for cervical cancer depended on the stage of disease and typically consisted of external-beam therapy to the whole pelvis averaging 40 Gy in daily 2-Gy fractions over 4 weeks plus one or two radium implants delivering an additional 10 Gy to the pelvic side- wall. The active bone marrow dose, averaged over the entire bone mar- row, was 8.1 Gy (range: 1.3-17 Gy), tenfold larger than the mean marrow dose received by the BGD subjects. Cytogenetics and Scoring Blood samples from women in the BGD cohort who lived in the Buf- falo area were processed in the cytogenetics laboratory at RPCI. Blood samples from BGD subjects living in Rhode Island, as well as from the cervical cancer cohort, were shipped to Oak Ridge Associated Universi- ties (ORAU) by overnight courier. Identical culture protocols were employed by the two laboratories except that RPCI employed density- gradient centrifugation and rosetting with sheep RBC to obtain purified T cells, whereas the ORAU laboratory employed leukocyte-rich plasma as a source of T lymphocytes for culture. Both laboratories used com- plete medium consisting of 83% RPMI 1640 medium, 15% v/v heat-inac- tivated fetal bovine serum, 1% antibiotic solution (all reagents from GIBCO) and 1% reconstituted phytohemagglutinin (PHA, Burroughs- Wellcome). Replicate cultures were initiated in the same medium sup- plemented with 30 ?tM bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (Calbiochem). After incubation at 370C for 44-45 h, colchicine was added to each culture to arrest mitoses, and 3 h later, all cultures were harvested and slides were prepared, stained and evaluated for percentages of cells in their second in vitro mitosis as described previously (1). The same scorers from the ORAU laboratory evaluated all cultures. Scorers had no knowledge of treatment status. Giemsa-stained slides were scanned systematically to locate metaphases, and whenever possi- ble, for each subject, 200 metaphases having centromere counts of 46 ? 1 from each culture were subjected to detailed microscopic evaluations to determine the frequencies and cellular distributions of all types of chro- mosome aberrations (1, 12). The nonbanded cytogenetic methods used in this study are similar to techniques used in several evaluations of radiation-induced chromosome damage in atomic bomb survivors (13-15) and ankylosing spondylitis patients (16) and were identical to the approach we used in our earlier cytogenetic evaluation of cervical cancer patients (1). Previous reports have documented that about 80% of the metaphases with aberrations and 76% of symmetrical exchanges identified by banding procedures can be detected using such detailed chromosome group analysis techniques (16-18). Because blood samples were collected over 6 years ago, our evaluations did not include the relatively new technology of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for translocation analysis (19). Statistical Methods Analyses were restricted to those classes of aberrations known to be induced by ionizing radiation. These were stable (translocations, inver- sions and chromosomes with deleted segments) and unstable (dicentrics, acentric fragments and centric rings) aberrations. Analyses were based on the percentages of metaphases with one or more aberrations, rather than the mean number per cell, to eliminate the possible influence of individual cells with large numbers of aberrations. Analyses were per- formed as described previously (1, 2), using linear models and assuming a binomial distribution for the proportion of cells with one or more aber- ration for each subject. All of the analyses were adjusted for extra-bino- mial variability among individuals (20), based on findings from the A-bomb survivors (21) and cervical cancer patients (1). When two or more metaphases having apparently identical stable aberrations were observed in lymphocyte cultures from any subject, the aberrant metaphases were considered possibly to be daughter cells of the same parent cell that sustained damage. Only one of the cells in each set was counted for the purpose of statistical analysis. For each type of stable and unstable aberration, the null hypothesis that aberrations were equally likely in nonirradiated and irradiated groups was tested, and two-sided P values are reported. All P values are adjusted for age at blood drawing by regression on age. Although age was not significantly related to the proportion of cells with aberrations, adjustment was performed because of the older mean age of the irradiated BGD cohort.</page><page sequence="3">42 KLEINERMAN ETAL.

RESULTS BGD Subjects We were able to score more than 10,000 metaphases from lymphocyte cultures from 34 irradiated and 26 nonirra- diated subjects. Our success rate in culturing lymphocytes for these elderly women was less than we usually achieve in younger subjects, possibly due to changes in the composi- tion of the mononuclear cell compartment of human periph- eral blood and decreased responsiveness of T lymphocytes to the mitogen, PHA, which have been observed in aged subjects (22, 23). Nonetheless, lymphocyte cultures from blood samples from 60 of these older women did yield metaphase preparations having sufficient mitotic indices and chromosome morphology for detailed cytogenetic evalua- tions. For most of the cultures, fewer than 5% of lympho- cytes had proceeded to their second metaphase by 47 to 48 h harvest time; thus the cytogenetic data were obtained pre- dominantly from evaluations of first-division metaphases. Basic descriptive data for each treatment group are presented in Table I. The irradiated subjects were older (41 years) at treatment compared with nonirradiated sub- jects (35 years), although the mean elapsed time from diagnosis to blood drawing was similar (42 years vs 41 years). Irradiated subjects were on average 83 years old at time of blood drawing and the nonirradiated subjects were younger, 76 years old. Table II presents the mean proportion of metaphases bearing stable and unstable aberrations by treatment group with estimates of error adjusted for age at blood drawing. The proportion of cells with any stable aberrations per 100 cells in the irradiated group exceeded the proportion per 100 cells in the nonirradiated group (2.06 vs 0.74; P = 0.002). The majority of the stable aberrations observed in cultures from irradiated as well as nonirradiated BGD subjects were translocations.

We observed duplicate aberrations (in each instance, two cells with apparently identical translocations) in cul- tures from four irradiated women. None were detected in nonirradiated subjects. Comparison of BGD and Cervical Cancer Patients Table III compares selected characteristics of the irradi- ated BGD and cervical cancer patients. For these compar- isons, we restricted data from the BGD patients to include only those 30 irradiated women whose lymphocytes were cultured at the ORAU laboratory, because culture methods were identical to those we had used previously for the cer- vical cancer patients. Although age at treatment was similar for the two study populations, almost twice as many years had elapsed since treatment for BGD (43 years vs 23 years), so that the subjects in the BGD cohort were older at the time of blood drawing (83 years vs 67 years). All but two BGD subjects from Rhode Island received radium implants only, whereas all of the cervical cancer patients received a combination of both radium implants and external-beam therapy. Doses averaged over the entire bone marrow were tenfold greater for cervical cancer patients and ranged from 1.3 to 17 Gy (average = 8 Gy) compared with doses ranging from 0.13 to 1.6 Gy (average = 0.7 Gy) for BGD patients. A twofold relative risk for leukemia was reported for both cohorts based on a simple yes/no radiation comparison, but the average excess relative risk per gray was greater for the BGD patients (1.66 vs 0.14). The mean frequencies of lymphocyte metaphases bearing one or more types of stable chromosome aberrations were similar in the two groups of women, i.e., an average of 2.85</page><page sequence="4">RADIOTHERAPY AND CHROMOSOME ABERRATIONS 43 TABLE III Comparison of Selected Characteristics of Irradiated BGD and Cervical Cancer Patients Study population Cervical Characteristic BGD cancer Number of subjects 30a 96 Age at irradiation 41 44 Years since treatment 43 23 Age at blood drawing 83 67 Local radiation site Pelvis Pelvis Average bone marrow dose and range (Gy) 0.74 (0.13-1.6) 8.1 (1.3-17) Mean proportion of cells with stable aberrations 2.21 (0.29) 2.85 (0.24) Relative risk (RR) for leukemia 2.00b 2.02c Average excess RR per gray for leukemia 1.66d 0.14e alncludes only those irradiated patients whose cultures were initiated at ORAU. bRef.

In all cultures, we also quantified the numbers of stable aberrations in each metaphase that displayed one or more abnormal monocentric chromosomes. Since aberra- tions were identified using classical "group analysis" scoring methods (1, 13-16) rather than more precise banding tech- niques, we may have underascertained the numbers of sym- metrical exchanges in cells carrying multiple aberrations. Nonetheless, these data are useful for making comparisons between the two irradiated cohorts. The cellular distribu- tions of stable aberrations in 19,061 lymphocyte metaphases from the cervical cancer patients and 5,934 metaphases from the BGD patients are shown in Table IV. In women treated for BGD, 91% of those metaphases bearing stable aberra- tions had a single translocation, inversion or deletion com- pared to 79% in the cervical cancer patients. The cellular distributions of aberrations were overdispersed relative to Poisson expectations in both groups of women. Such overdispersion is observed typically in individuals who receive a highly localized exposure to a portion of the body because the dose distribution to lymphocytes and lympho- cyte progenitors is not homogeneous. The greater degree of overdispersion observed in the pooled data set from the cer- vical cancer patients was as expected because the doses received by these women varied widely, and because some women received very large doses, i.e. &gt;17 Gy. The total number of stable aberrations observed in the cervical cancer patients was slightly higher than in the BGD patients (i.e., 3.6 vs 2.4 per hundred), but the difference was small com- pared to the difference in their doses. DISCUSSION Radiation-induced stable chromosome aberrations in T lymphocytes are sensitive biomarkers of exposure in popula- tions who received whole-body or partial-body exposures up to several decades ago (1, 2, 15, 24, 25). Within groups of patients having similar types of exposure, aberration fre- quencies show positive dose-response relationships. Howev- er, frequencies of persistent aberrations do not necessarily show strict correlations with dose when data are compared between populations who received different types of expo- sure, even when lymphocytes are cultured at similar times after exposure and evaluated using identical scoring tech- niques. When we compared cytogenetic findings in cultured lymphocytes from cervical cancer patients (mean marrow dose of 8.1 Gy) with data from A-bomb survivors (mean marrow dose 1 Gy), it was apparent that higher frequencies of persistent stable aberrations resulted per unit dose from the acute whole-body radiation received by the A-bomb sur- vivors than for the partial-body exposure received in multi- ple high-dose-rate fractions by the cervical cancer patients (1). We speculated that such differences in frequencies of persistent aberrations may result from differences in dose distribution (i.e., partial-body vs whole-body exposures), dose rate or by a dose wastage effect if extensive cell killing TABLE IV Observed Distributions of Stable Chromosome Aberrations in Pooled Data from Cultured Lymphocytes of 96 Women Who Received Localized Pelvic Radiation for Cervical Cancer and 30 Women Who Received Localized Pelvic Irradiation for Benign Gynecological Disease (BGD) Number of stable Stable aberrations per Distribution of cells with n stable aberrations Cohort aberrations 100 cells 0 1 2 3 24 Cervical cancer 676 3.6 18,527 420 90 21 3 BGD 141 2.4 5,807 116 9 1 1</page><page sequence="5">44 KLEINERMAN ET AL. occurs in the radiation field. Since a lower leukemia risk has also been observed in cervical cancer patients compared to A-bomb survivors, it appeared that persistent chromosome aberrations in peripheral T lymphocytes many years after radiation exposure may show better correlations with ulti- mate risk for development of leukemia than with actual dose received. To gain additional information on possible correlations between persistent chromosome aberrations in lymphoid cells and the risk of radiation-induced leukemia, we initiat- ed studies to compare our findings in cervical cancer patients with data from a group of women who received localized radiotherapy to the same region of the body for benign gynecological disease. Age at treatment was similar for the two groups of women; however, almost twice as many years have elapsed since treatment for BGD (43 years vs 23 years), so that the women in the BGD cohort were older than the cervical cancer patients at the time blood was drawn. Since data from several earlier studies have suggested that baseline frequencies of stable and/or unstable types of chromosome aberrations may show an increase with age (3, 26-28), we initially compared cytogenetic findings in lymphocyte cultures from the two groups of nonirradiated women. In lymphocyte cultures from the 26 nonirradiated BGD patients whose mean age was 76 at the time of blood collection, an average of 0.74 ? 0.19 metaphases carried one or more stable types of chromosomal aberrations, while 0.30 ? 0.10 metaphases contained one or more unstable aberrations. These aberration frequencies are similar to those we observed previously in 26 nonirradiated women with cervical cancer whose average age was 65 at the time of blood collection (i.e. 0.69 ? 0.11 and 0.40 ? 0.09 metaphases with stable and unstable aberrations, respec- tively). Thus, even though the BGD patients were some- what older than the cervical cancer patients at the time their blood was collected for lymphocyte culture and cyto- genetic evaluation, baseline frequencies of chromosome aberrations in the two groups of nonirradiated women were similar, suggesting that differences in age should not affect data comparisons between the two elderly cohorts of irradi- ated patients. Nonetheless, all statistical comparisons took age into account. Compared to findings in nonirradiated BGD patients, we observed that the number of lymphocytes carrying one or more symmetrical types of aberrations was increased by about threefold in women with similar nonmalignant dis- eases who had received intracavitary radiation exposures more than 40 years ago. This finding extends our earlier observations which have demonstrated that radiation- induced stable aberrations in mitogen-responsive lympho- cytes are sensitive biomarkers of exposures in populations of persons who received partial-body irradiation many years previously (1, 2). The mean half-life of lymphocytes has been estimated to range from 130 days (29) to up to 3 years (30). Thus it is probable that most of the lymphocytes that were evaluated in these BGD patients for radiation-induced chromosome aberrations were progeny of lymphoid pro- genitors that had repopulated the peripheral lymphoid com- partment during the several decades that had elapsed between their exposure and collection of blood for cytoge- netic evaluations. The increase in the number of cells carry- ing asymmetrical types of aberrations in the irradiated BGD patients is not significant but may represent a small propor- tion of immunocompetent T lymphocytes surviving without undergoing mitotic cell division for up to 50 years after exposure. Although we have not previously detected increased frequencies of asymmetrical aberrations in our long-term follow-up studies of other cohorts of patients who received partial-body radiotherapy (3), long-term survival of lymphocytes with asymmetrical aberrations has been noted in the Hiroshima and Nagasaki A-bomb survivors as well as ankylosing spondylitis patients (15, 25). Alternatively, the increase in unstable aberrations in the irradiated BGD sub- ject might reflect more recent radiation exposures than we were able to identify in the screening interview, although both treatment groups were screened similarly. A primary purpose of our study was to compare the fre- quencies of residual chromosome aberrations in cultured lymphocytes in women who received localized irradiation for benign and malignant gynecological diseases more than two decades ago. We observed that the mean frequencies of lymphocytes bearing stable types of chromosome aberra- tions were quite similar in preparations from the two groups of women, despite the fact that cervical cancer patients had received on average a tenfold higher bone marrow dose than received by women treated for BGD. If mitogen- responsive lymphocytes bearing symmetrical aberrations several decades after exposure are indeed progeny of irradi- ated lymphoid stem cells, then our findings suggest a larger fraction of chromosomally aberrant stem cells survived per unit dose in subjects irradiated for benign disease than in those patients who received high, localized doses to the same region of the body for cervical cancer. Several radiobi- ological factors, such as total dose, dose deposition, dose rate and protraction of dose, could have contributed to cell sterilization or a disproportionate survival of stem cells car- rying chromosome aberrations in these two populations. Regarding the total radiation dose received by the two groups of women, the cervical cancer patients were treated with external-beam radiotherapy to the whole pelvis (total average accumulated dose 40 Gy), plus one or two intra- cavitary radiation insertions delivering an additional 10 Gy to the pelvic sidewall (1). At such high local doses, it is like- ly that most hematopoietic stem cells that were present in the radiation field would have received lethal doses; thus</page><page sequence="6">RADIOTHERAPY AND CHROMOSOME ABERRATIONS 45 most of the dose was "wasted" in terms of causing late effects (1, 8), whereas the estimated mean dose of y radia- tion to marrow in the pelvic bone of BGD subjects was typ- ically 1.5 Gy (range: 0.38-4.08 Gy) (5). For both the cervical cancer and BGD patients, one might speculate that some proportion of the surviving frac- tion of irradiated stem cells of both the lymphoid and myeloid lineages would be expected to carry biologically relevant chromosome rearrangements that could be crucial events in cancer genesis. Our observation of similar residual burdens of cytogenetic damage in cultured lymphocytes of these two groups of women who have similar risks for leukemia in spite of the fact that their mean dose differed by an order of magnitude suggest that persistent stable aberrations in lymphoid progenitors may be a useful surro- gate biomarker of the relative levels of cytogenetic injury sustained by other populations of hematopoietic stem cells. The cytogenetic data are indeed consistent with epidemio- logical observations of a twofold leukemia risk in both of these populations. Moreover, a higher average excess rela- tive risk per gray for acute leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia related to mean bone marrow exposure has been observed in the BGD cohort (1.66/Gy) (5), compared with the cervical cancer patients (0.14/Gy) (8). In our comparisons of data from these two groups of irra- diated women, we attempted to control for as many poten- tial confounding variables as possible. Samples of blood were collected using the same supplier of heparin and vacu- tainer tubes, and samples were shipped overnight under identical shipping conditions. In culturing the lymphocytes for cytogenetic evaluations, we used identical culture tech- niques and reagents and used the same approach for micro- scopic analysis of metaphase aberrations. The same scorers prepared and evaluated slides from both groups of women. Our finding that the two groups of women exhibit similar frequencies of stable aberrations in their cultured lympho- cytes many years after exposure thus provides support for our hypothesis that persistent stable aberrations in lymphoid stem cells correlate more closely with cancer risk than with the actual partial-body radiation dose.
