<plain_text><page sequence="1">354 Book Reviews Of course Dunn is right in insisting that there is a gap between a program of radical critique and the possibilities of its being implemented in practice; but it is disingenuous to limit the field of politics to a rational discussion of what an administration can achieve at any particular historical conjuncture. This is the point at which the important questions arise. Is not the proliferation of new struggles and new demands the necessary condition for an extension of democracy to the whole field of civil society? Does not this extension modify the system of structural constraints characteristic of contemporary industrial societies and open the field for new socialist theoretical efforts that can avoid the danger of totalitarian outcomes? These are central questions for both so- cialist and democratic theories, but one can hardly find in John Dunn's book the beginning of an adequate treatment of them. ERNESTO LACLAU University of Essex Spirit in Ashes: Hegel, Heidegger, and Man-made Mass Death. By Edith Wyschogrod. New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1985. Pp. xvi+247. $22.50. Edith Wyschogrod, a philosopher writing in the phenomenological tradition, maintains that philosophical thinking has failed to confront the meaning of the events epitomized in the names "Auschwitz" and "Hiroshima." Spirit in Ashes attempts to give these events the philosophical attention they deserve. In her first two chapters, she discusses the logic and implications of the "death event" and ''death-world" to which these names point. Modern technological society, she asserts, is the offspring of a science that by its very nature is alienated from the immediacy of the Lebenswelt. The death-world of the extermination camps and of a possible postholocaustic future is not just alienated from the Lebenswelt but is wrenched almost free of it, for its aim is death itself. In the central chapters of the book she discusses Hegel and Heidegger, two previous philosophers who have reflected on death, from the perspective of such faceless annihilation. In her last chapter she sketches out a conception of the self that she contends is appropriate to a contemporary existence dominated by the specter of man-made mass death. Spirit in Ashes can be read in three ways; as history, as textual exegesis and commentary, and as theory. With regard to the first, Wyschogrod notes that her account of the death event "does not purport to be historical in the sense that a given set of facts supports an empirical generalization." The death event, it turns out, is "not a string of facts that together form the basis for historical generalization"; rather, it "constitutes a new grid through which all experi- encing now takes place, a new historical a priori amenable to phenomenological analysis" (pp. 63-64). Still, in asserting that the structure of experience is different from what it was in the past, in suggesting that the death-world is a response to certain features of technological society, and in countless other ways, Wyschogrod makes historical statements. Are these statements true? How adequate are the arguments brought up in their support? In the absence of more persuasive arguments than those Wyschogrod provides, historians will</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 355 want to read this book in the same way that one is inclined to read Foucault: in the mode of ;'as if" temporarily suspending criticism in order to see what insights the perspective generates. As exegesis and commentary, Spirit in Ashes provides a series of summaries of aspects of Hegel and Heidegger that Wyschogrod finds relevant to the death event. These summaries are punctuated by attempts to show how the positions that Hegel and fiIeidegger articulate either help us to understand the death event or else fall short of doing so. Her discussion of Hegel is the less inter- esting. Some of the material that she covers is already rather familiar. Fur- thermore, the optimistic teleology that undergirds Hegel's philosophical project occupies a different universe from Auschwitz. Though Wyschogrod shows that there is nonetheless much in lIegel that relates to her theme, her linkages are sometimes forced. Yet she does give us some good insights; to take only one example, she contrasts in an illuminating way Hegels view that evil requires self-reflection with Hannah Arendt?s discovery that it can assume a banal, unreflective character (pp. 72-76). Wyschogrod's discussion of the later Heidegger seems needlessly uncriticalS for she never really asks how we know it to be true that we are the victims as Heidegger says we arex of Western metaphysics. However, I find persuasive her argument that Heidegger, both early and late, overemphasizes the human being's relation to things and underemphasizes its relationship to other persons . She suggests that this insistence on the primacy of things helps account for the strange fact that in contemplating the alleged devastation of the modern age, the later Heidegger seems rather more perturbed by the hydroelectric plants that stand astride the hitherto unharnessed Rhine than by the death of millions in war and concentration camps. Admittedly, it is by no means a new point to note the primacy that Heideggers existential analytic grants to thingly being and its consequent exclusion of an I-Thou meeting. The arguments on this score are both summed up and carried forward in Michael Theunissen's authoritative study The Other: Studies in the Social OntoZogy of Hasserly Hei- deggerX Sartre, and Buber (trans. Christopher Macann, with an introduction by Fred R. Dallmayr [Cambridge, Mass., 1984], pp. 180-83 and passim). In its guise as theory Spirit in Ashes makes a number of contributions. Most original is Wyschogrod's attempt to show that the ';logic?' of the death event has a formal resemblance to Zeno's paradoxes of finitude and infinity. Totali- tarian discourse, she contends, treats the finite number of persons slated for destruction as if they were an infinite reserve: consider the immense thought- less wastage of human life in the various killing fields. Those exercising power in these circumstances forget that the individual members of a group are not parts that can be subdivided infinitely. They fall victim to a category mistake which their discourse conceals through myths (of class or race) purporting to explain the present state of affairs (pp. 36-39). Wyschogrodss last chapter, in which she seeks to articulate a new concept of the self appropriate to the age of man-made mass deathS is far too brief and schematic. In general, one has the impression that she allowed the relatively easy task of explicating and commenting on Hegel and Heidegger to sidetrack her from grappling fully with the philosophical and historical issues that Spirit in Ashes was intended to confront. The book as a whole will inevitably strike historians as far too speculative; it will strike some philosophers as not spec- ulative enough. It is thus a disappointing treatment of an important subjectS</page><page sequence="3">356 Book Reviews though it does advance some interesting ideas and to that extent is grist for the historian's mill. ALLAN MEGILL University of Iowa Life Histories and Psychobiography: Explorations in Theory and Method. By William McKinley lVunyan. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1984. Pp. xiii+288. $9.95. The Structure of Mind in History: Five Major Figures in Psychohistory. By Philip Pomper. New York: Columbia University Press, 1985. Pp. xvi + 192. $20.00. These two books, both excellent in their own ways, demonstrate the diversity of issues and methods encompassed by the term "psychohistory." Runyan's Life Histories and Psychobiography is rooted in the methodology of behavioral science and the concerns of individual case history as much as in life history. By contrast, Pomper's The Structure of Mind in History is a contribution to the philosophy of history from a psychohistorical perspective. Despite their clarity and balance, Runyan's essays on methodology in Life Histories and Psychobiography will be of less interest to the professional his- torian. Runyan's training is in academic psychology, and many of the topics of the book are more relevant to the clinician or the behavioral science re- searcher. However, Runyan's training enables him to approach the psycho- biography debate with an engaging and informed skepticism. He employs the perspectives and parameters of empirical science to clarify the welter of facts and hypotheses on which assertions in psychobiography are often based. Run- yan is at his best in his chapter "Why Did Van Gogh Cut off fIis Ear? The Problem of Alternative Explanations in Psychobiography," in which he eval- uates the divergent accounts of the artist's self-mutilating behavior. Even as he argues for a methodologically more rigorous approach to life history, he resists an empiricist reductionism that would eliminate the qualitative and speculative dimensions of traditional narrative biographies and more innovative psychobiographies. Unfortunately, Runyan's chapter on "The Psychobiogra- phy Debate" is little more than a methodological introduction to the subject. There is no in-depth discussion of current issues in psychobiography, no treat- ment of more contemporary psychoanalytic models, and no examination of the relation between the study of individual lives and that of groups. Runyan is a perceptive critic of the psychobiographical approach but has little to add to it. In contrast to Runyan's emphasis on life history, Philip Pomper focuses on psychohistory in the context of the nature of historical discourse. Taking his lead from Hayden White's Metahistory (Baltimore, 1973), Pomper examines the relevant works of Freud, Erikson, Marcuse, Brown, and Lifton in terms of five architectonics or "principles for structuring processes of development." In the case of psychohistory particularly, these architectonics are metaphors that reflect what Pomper terms an ''endopsychic anthropomorphism": mental constructs that have an imaginative appeal in so far as they draw on "attitudes,</page></plain_text>
