<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dorothy Cross Kerlin Gallery, Dublin 7 June ? 3 July 90 Dorothy Cross filled the Kerlin Gallery with an array of objects and images which, while individually diverse and fragmented, suggested such an air of overall thematic cohesion that the ex hibition cried out for a more definitive title than the non-commital, neutrally descriptive Recent Sculpture that was all it received. The installation of the show was cleverly conceived and used the particular environment of the Kerlin to advantage. It was dominated by the substantial Lockers, a row of lockers from which a group of fish surged out powerfully across the floor ? each, though, tethered to its source by a steel cord. The piece was typical in its use of found objects, whose meaning and function were ironically recast and subverted, and in its meticulously crafted finish. Also typical was the way Lockers redefined the space that con tained it, turning the gallery into a submarine environment, an effect enhanced by carefully controlled artificial lighting and the subdued natural light that filters into the Kerlin's atrium-like room from above. Lockers presented the viewer with a strong image of energy unleashed. The lockers were just that, previously enclos ed containers which had evidently burst open to release the fish and water in which they swam. There was also, however, a distinct masculinity about the whole tableau, about the aggressive quality of the explosive outward rush, and about the connotations of a row of lockers in them selves. These evoked the stereotypical picture of the locker room, not, admittedly, a universally male preserve but one strongly associated (via sports journalism, television and film, for exam ple) with male athletes and a conventionally masculine concern with physical prowess and competitiveness. The machismo of the locker room, however, was ironically undercut by the context, for the implication was that the concept of exaggerated masculinity that it entails is in fact an inhibiting, restrictive framework, in which the self is, so to speak, imprison ed. And what, through conscious egocentricity, it represses are aspects of the self that contradict the conventional masculine im age, inhibiting a sense of wholeness of the self, exemplified in the ambiguous spectacle of the fish surging free, intimately in tune with their environment, the underwater realm that is the un conscious. Yet ambiguous it is, for, as is underlined elsewhere in the show, it is also possible to interpret the fish, the sharks, as pure animus, a negative force let loose from the Pandora's box of the lockers. Space here has again been turned inside-out, by virtue of the ^b^b v ^^i^W|[|^Hwp|y ffljl|^^^^^BWB|BR|lBRB Dorothy Cross, Lighthouse, 1990, photograph and wire. way the 'inwardness' of an animal, the deep, unquestioning rap port that exists between it and its environment 'psychifies' that temporal and spatial environment, and can symbolise, as here, aspects of the relationship of human conscious to unconscious. Cross consistently employs exterior spaces as interior, psychic ones. The Mirror that leads us into the show, with its external female characteristics, is a doorway into the unconscious ? and perhaps dreamlike ? space that in a real sense contains the en tire exhibition. There were other anthropomorphic portraits in the show, in</page><page sequence="2">eluding Moon Shark, Moon Cage and Lighthouse. To take the last as a representative example: Lighthouse is 'male'. It consists of a framed photograph of a lighthouse, against which a huge wave is breaking and beyond which lies the ocean. Frame and image are enclosed in a a wire 'cage'. This wire framework is distorted into two projections, positioned in such a way that we read them as testicles attached to the phallic lighthouse. The cage is the outward form, the individual but, as with the lockers, the individual is contained, caged ? in an image of masculinity as conventional, perhaps, as the picture frame. This is by no means the end of the story, however, for the ocean is also within the outward frame, and in relation to the overt, con scious, male animus the ocean is the unconscious anima ? as the submarine darkness is to the light of consciousness. Further more, the anima informs the animus: the water literally engulfs, drenches the lighthouse. This reading of the work, which takes its cue from Ebb, Cross's major exhibition at the Douglas Hyde Gallery in 1988, suggests that what is being described here, and in the pieces throughout the show as a whole, relates to a Jungian interpretation of the process of individuation, whereby the com plementary male and female elements, animus and anima, are gradually accomodated within the individual psyche. Where Lockers is stereotypically male, Kitchen Table is stereotypically female, a functional domestic object framing a vessel, which eventually tames the aggressive animus, perhaps to the point of counterproductive repression, as the corroded con tainer and the fossilised shark's teeth, impotently locked away, 41 seem to suggest. In Skate, however, the rounded form of the fish, suggests not merely the female at home in the depths of the unconscious, but wholeness, anchored as it is to another, affirmatively spherical form, the implicity male buoy (boy ? the work is littered with such Lacanian trapdoors of meaning and double meanings), mak ing up a composite picture of an integrated psyche. Cross's work eludes easy categorisation in the way it shifts restlessly between divergent means of expression. Although she is meticulous in terms of craft and clearly enjoys the demands of making things well and precisely, she is also adept at picking up on the meanings of found objects and images, using their presence and, more importantly in a way, their energy to fuel her own projects. In putting things together she also has a tenden cy to take their meanings apart, implicating them in radically dif ferent chains of signification. A certain, almost surgical fastidiousness of method and a tax onomic, quasi-clinical approach to selecting, making and juxtapos ing the various elements that comprise the physical substance of her work give it a specific, slightly unsettling quality, an un mistakable atmosphere of its own. The essence of this atmosphere has to do with an oblique, probing approach to subjects and materials, an approach that usually entails an abrasiveness of finish: you are never quite comfortable with a sculpture of Dorothy Cross, but you are also provoked into curiosity.
