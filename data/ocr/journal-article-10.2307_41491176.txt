Since Formalism and the Marxist objections to it have proved resilient, it may be instructive to isolate the principle themes of the debate in the initial, Soviet confrontation. Among the earliest Marxist critics of Formalism, Trotsky evinced a willingness to import Formalist methods into a totalizing Marxist criti- cism. For Trotsky, it is only when formal analysis becomes an end in itself, "a philosophy of art, a Weltanschauung, that it becomes an utterly false and reaction- ary conception."1 In his view, the emergence of the literary product must be grounded in determinate and specific historical conditions: "Marxism alone can explain why and how a given tendency in art has originated in the period of his- tory."2 In the late 1920's, the view that the form of the art work cannot be under- stood apart from the historically conditioned material available to it was further elaborated by the Bakhtin group which, among other things, opposed Shklovsky's division of poetic construction into device and material: "Everything that the formalists regard as material has an unconditional constitutive significance."3 This 1.

Vološinov's suggestion that the mediation between the literary art work and social life is the semiotic process of language itself more fully anticipates the de- bate's contemporary form (in the West): Idealism and Psychologism alike overlook the fact that understanding itself can come about only within some kind of semiotic material (e.g. inner speech ), that sign bears upon sign , that consciousness itself can arise and be- come a viable fact only in the material embodiment of signs. The understand- ing of a sign is , after all an act of reference between the sign apprehended and other y already known signs; in other words , understanding is a response to a sign with signs . . . and nowhere is there a break in the chain , nowhere does the chain plunge into inner being , non-material in nature and unembodied in signs* VoloSinov's interest in a materialist philosophy of language indicates not only the direction of study most likely to effect a successful combination of the sociological commitment of Marxism and the careful attention to intrinsic values of Formalism, but also the direction in which the underlying conflicts of Cartesian (and Saus- surean) dualism and Marxist monism, idealism and materialism may seek resolu- tion.5 As the early Formalist ideas evolved in the direction of structuralism and semiotics, Marxist critics continued to identify the tendencies toward synchronism, dualism and semantic inadequacy which they saw as the surviving vestiges of the Formalist ideas underlying these disciplines. My interest here shall be to indicate in some detail a contemporary treatment of the issues outlined above and to suggest some of the ways in which non-Marxist criticisms like formalism, structuralism and semiotics have contributed to the elaboration of a materialist philosophy of language which accounts more adequately for the fact that our understanding even of His- tory itself is necessarily within semiotic material. To illustrate this process of confrontation and adaptation, I will examine some of the work of Fredric Jameson, who has devoted a great deal of energy to an publication, 1928. Since the disputed authorship of works signed Bakhtin, VoloŠinov, or Medvedev is not an issue here, I shall, for convenience, simply refer to the names appearing on the title pages of the editions cited.

For Jameson: All the great twentieth-century schools-whether those of pragmatism or phenomenology , existentialismy logical positivism , or structuralism-share a renunciation of content, find their fulfillment in formalism , in the refusal of all presuppositions in the substitution of method for metaphysical systems J This flight from content, which is indeed a flight from meaning, makes formalism, "the basic mode of interpretation of those who refuse interpretation" ("Metacom- mentary," 12). Preliminary to a discussion of the formalism into which such diverse intellectual motives as pragmatism, existentialism, phenomenology, and structuralism resolve and an attempt to define an adequate "interpretation," that is, to identify precisely what is being refused by these movements, it shall be useful to briefly review Jameson's discussion of Russian Formalism. While recognizing the diversity and evolution within the movement, Jameson identifies Shklovsky's notion of ostranenie, the "making strange of objects [to achieve] a renewal of perception," as the necessary formulation of Formalist literary theory.8 Ostranenie isolates the literary system from the automatized realm of everyday life (and language), and provides an a priori purpose for all literary work. This allows Shklovsky to divide the elements of any work into 6. We shall be concerned with a Marxism distinct from the specifically structuralist (or post-structuralist) Marxisms of Louis Althusser or the Tel Quel group on the one hand, and the doctrinaire variety exemplified in a recent Soviet publication, Yuri Barabash, Aesthetics and Poetics (Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1977), on the other. The latter, while recognizing with some clarity the issues underlying the confrontation of dialectical materialism and structuralism, also priviliges the particular literary style of socialist realism, and is therefore impelled to a peremptory value judgment not only on the available critical operations, but also on the objects those operations tend to favor. Now, it is certainly true that art forms elicit specific critical methods and, conversely, that critical methods favor those art forms most accessible to them. But this situation may be recognized by, and incorporated into, the critical act, or it may be simply denounced. The familiar vulgar Marxist polarization of works and critical methods as decadent/realistic (still very much alive in Professor Barabash 's aesthetics) is, it seems to me, part of a moral criticism- that is, one which appeals to evaluative criteria established prior to the critical act and extrinsic to it. The aim of this criticism is to foster the development of "good" literature and discourage that of "bad." It patronizes art by acknowledging art's role in the formation of values, but neglecting its role in their discovery, a view quite different from those I shall be discussing in this essay.

Ostranenie further suggests an intrinsic concept of literary history "as a series of abrupt dis- continuities, of ruptures with the past, where each new literary present is seen as a break with the dominant artistic canons of the generation immediately preceding" (PHL, pp. 52-53). As a "device" becomes familiar, it loses its primary function of slowing the reader's perception; form exhausts itself, and literary history represents the cycle of innovation, automatization, innovation. Jameson contrasts Shklovsky's notion of ostranenie with Brecht's "estrange- ment effect" (Verfremdung). Whereas Shklovsky creates an opposition between "things and human reality," Brecht's opposition is between "the static and the dynamic" (PHL, p. 58). It can be noted here that the two formulations may easily refer to the same phenomenon, but that they are motivated differently. Jameson favors Brecht's approach because it gives art a distinct (and laudatory) social func- tion: that of reminding us that things are historically determined. Shklovsky gives us "a history of works," Brecht "a history of perception" (PHLf p. 59). The move- ment from one to the other is a movement to reconnect the work to causes outside the boundaries of literature. Shklovsky's doctrine "ends up turning diachrony into mere appearance and undermining any genuine historical awareness of the changing forms" (PHL, p. 59). This is the necessary result of seeing literature as a system independent of the con- tent social experience makes available to it. Further, the temporality of the indi- vidual work becomes problematic; questions of narrative and its relation to the totality of the work, the specific ordering of events in a text and the identification of the elements necessary to give us the feeling of a completed whole are not ade- quately dealt with. The implications of this inadequacy are suggested in Jameson's critique of Propp's Morphology of the Folktale? As Shklovsky sought to move from the treatment of the individual work to the elaboration of general laws applicable to the literary system, Propp sought a treatment of the fairy tale that would move away from the isolated content of specific tales to a systematic description of the fairy tale form. Thus Propp establishes a distinction between horizontal and vertical which is a little like the Saussurean categories of the syntagmatic and the associative on the one hand, and the Shklovskian distinction between the basic device (the actual de familiarization) and the motivation on the other. The story line is considered as a series of abstract functions; the form taken by the various functions-the shape and identity of a given character or a landscape, or the nature of the obstacles-is unessential and derives its content from the cul- tural and historical context .

Wagner (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1968).</page><page sequence="5">JAMESON'S CRITICAL NARRATIVE 263 We may here recall Propp's generalized fairy tale narrative: The tale always begins either with injury or lack. The hero must set about to redress the injury or supply the lack; but he is never able to do this without the aid of a donor. The end of the tale is implied by the beginning. We do not ask what will happen-for we know the villain will be defeated, the injury avenged, the necessary object located and pos- sessed. On the contrary, the specific fairy tale narrative is generated by the question of how the hero's ultimate success will be achieved. The answer to the question is determined by the donor. Thus the narrative quality of the fairy tale is dependent upon a detour through character. According to Propp's scheme, after the hero's encounter with the donor, the tale may continue in one of two options: the hero either engages in decisive combat with the villain or he successfully completes a series of tasks. Jameson restates these alternatives as "interpersonal competition or work," and suggests that both reflect "the primary reality of a world of scarcity, a world in which not only can I not fulfill my own basic needs without work, but in which my very existence is a threat to the existence of others as well" ( PHL , pp. 68-69). 10 The connection of the fairy tale structure and the historical fact of scarcity would then be the interpretation refused by the Formalist analysis. What appears to be an explanation of the fairy tale as a complete narrative form, then, reduces it to a set of static oppositions between self and other: "There can be no genuine law of the story or of the folk-tale unless the diachronic se- quence of narrated events, the syntax of narration, is somehow transposed into a synchronic structure" {PHL, p. 69).11 Propp's study of the fairy tale ultimately falls prey to the same extrinsic (historical) and intrinsic (narrative) synchronies as did Shklovsky's о s tranenie. Jameson locates the originality of the Formalist idea in its inversion of the Aristotelian concept of technique which leads outside the work "toward the 'end' or purpose for which it was constructed." The Formalists reversed this model , and saw the aim of all technique simply as the production of the work of art itself Now the meanings of a work , the effect it produces , the world view it embodies (such as Swift's misanthropy , Flaubert's ennui), become themselves technique: raw materials which are there in order to permit this particular work to come into being; and with this inversion of priorities the work itself is turned inside out , seen now from the standpoint of the producer rather than that of the consumer , and a criti- cal revolution is achieved which bears a striking resemblance to what the 10.

For now the referential values of the work (its meaning , the " reality " it presents , reflects , or imitates) are suspended , and for the first time the intrinsic structures of the work , in its autonomy as a construction , become visible to the naked eye. ("Metacommentary," 1 1)12 Analysis of this type resists content by making it an aspect of form, the rationaliz- ing motivation of form. The implication is that if a work is about anything, it is about its own construction. Thus form itself becomes content. Jameson accepts that there is a degree to which all literary works "at the same time they speak the language of reference, also emit a kind of lateral message about their own process of formation," and that this "lateral message" is "the social basis of Formalism as a method, insofar as the work is work solidified, the product the end-result of production" ( PHL , p. 89). Formalism extricates itself from some of the contradictions of Shklovsky's ostranenie and makes its strongest gesture toward a sociology of literature when Jurij Tynjanov replaces the notion of technique with that of dominant and second- ary elements {PHL, p. 92). 13 Tynjanov's model, which sees "artistic perception as a deviation from a norm has the advantage of including the norm within the work of art itself as the older elements relegated to the background; thus the latter no longer spill outside the work and over into what are ultimately social problems, i.e., the dominant tastes, the dominant literary modes of a period" (PHL, p. 92). 14 Still, "even Tynjanov retains Saussure 's basic model of change, in which the essen- tial mechanisms at work are the ultimate abstractions of Identity and Difference" (PHL, p. 96). Although Tynjanov brings history into the literary system by setting literature against the system of everyday life and everyday language, he fails to achieve the unity of identity and difference available in dialectical thought. The process of re-synchronization, the absorption of diachrony into syn- chrony, of temporal development into static association, is clarified by Jameson's discussion of the Saussurean division of synchrony from diachrony: The ontological foundations of the synchronic and the diachronic are quite different from each other. The former lies in the immediate lived experience of the native speaker; the latter rests on a kind of intellectual construction, the result of comparisons between one moment of lived time and another by 12. A more extended discussion of this point appears in PHL, pp. 82-91. 13.

( PHL , p. 6) This sharp ontological distinction underlies the difficulty of containing both synchrony and diachrony within a single system. Thus, just as Shklovsky's syn- chronic literary studies drew the author's life and social context into the literary system, relegating properly historical material to "motivation" and thereby revers- ing the Aristotelian concept of technique, Saussure 's separation of the synchronic and diachronic aspects of linguistics tends to absorb the history of phonetic change into the synchronic web of phonemic identities and differences. Jameson invites us to consider Roman Jakobson's attempt to reintroduce diachrony into Saussure 's model through a homeostatic system of language change: If a rupture of the system 's equilibrium precedes a given mutation, and if there results from this mutation a suppression of the disequilibrium , then we have no difficulty discovering the mutation's function: its task is to reestab- lish the equilibrium. However , when a mutation reestablishes the equilibrium at one point in the system , it may break it at other points and provoke the need for a new mutation. 15 But, as Jameson points out, the initial rupture of the system is itself comprehensi- ble "in terms of historical events" (PHL, p. 21). For example, the set of changes involved in the transition from Anglo-Saxon to Middle English could hardly be completely understood without reference to the Norman Conquest and the po- litically motivated imposition of the victor's language. While the process of lan- guage change may be understood through internal linguistic mutations, the specific phonetic changes that destablize the language system refer to extrinsic causal chains. Just as Propp's fairy tale hid within it the historical fact of scarcity, Saus- sure 's synchronic language may hide within it the host of historical factors which have shaped it. Although the distinction between diachronic and synchronic is antithetical, the opposition of langue and parole, internal to the synchronic system, is dialectical. This form of the opposition of part to whole "will have as its function the un- tangling from one another of various heterogeneous systems within language itself" (PHL, p. 25). Just as Saussure separates the diachronic study of language from the synchronic, he separates the study of parole from that of langue. This separates the articulation of speech (parole) from its comprehension (langue), and allows Saus- sure to study language as a system uncomplicated by the presence of a specified object such as a specific speech act. Primary in the articulation of the langue into a system is Saussure 's notion of the sign: "The linguistic sign unites, not a thing and 15. "Principe de phonologie historique," reprinted in N. S. Trubetskoy, Principe de phonologie (Paris: Klincksieck, 1964), p. 334; quoted in PHL, p. 20.</page><page sequence="8">MARSHALL GROSSMAN 266 a name, but a concept and an acoustic image."16 The connection between concept or signified and acoustic image or signifier is arbitrary; this binary concept of the sign excludes the referent from the language system: The movement from word to thing is "absorbed and interiorized in the sign itself as the movement from the signifier to the signified" (PHL, p. 32). 17 We may also recall here that Saussure 's concept of language is thoroughly diacritical: we perceive not substances, but the series of identities and differences. Thus we cannot achieve a linguistic perception without simultaneous awareness of its opposite. Jameson notes that unlike the "contradiction" of dialectical thought, the binary opposition of Saussure 's linguistics is a "static antithesis" {PHL, p. 36), and he suggests that this structure is, in fact, the internal aspect of the opposition between diachrony and synchrony that is Saussure 's starting point. What Jameson is most interested in resisting here is, I believe, the easy exten- sion of this diacriticallity from a linguistic model to "the functional condition, the condition of possibility, for every sign," and from there to the institutionalized ontological gap for which Derrida has coined the neologism diffêrance .18 Because the implications of this thought threaten to slam shut the door to the prison house of language, it is a discourse Jameson deems not wrong, but fruitless. Jameson concludes his critique of Saussure by assimilating the concept of the paradigmatic and syntagmatic axes of language to that of synchrony and diachrony: the vertical axis of association is essentially atemporal, while the hori- zontal axis of the sentence unfolds temporally. Even on this level, Saussure pri- vileges the synchronic, associative axis whose "priority ... is already implicit in the model" (PHL, p. 38). Since we never perceive the individual units of the syntagma separately, but only as "part of a larger unity, which is the syntagma itself," the syntagma, in the very process of our perception of it "is reabsorbed into associative thought and understood through its resemblance to other syntagmata" (PHL, p. 38). Thus the repudiation of history which is Saussure 's starting point is re-inscribed as the limitation of his results. Although one sees in the general context of his argu- ment how Jameson arrives at this rather elegant conclusion, it may be noted that he has rendered the process more static than it need be.

This trace relates no less to what is called the future than to what is called the past, and it constitutes what is called the present by this very relation to what it is not, to what it absolutely is not; that is, not even to a past or future con- sidered as a modified present."

The utterance is, therefore, a semantic stream which pulls individual words into its continuous flux, depriving them of a consider- able part of their independence of reference and meaning. Every word in an utterance remains semantically "open" up to the moment that the utterance ends. ... A dynamic semantic unit differs from a static one by virtue of the fact that it occurs as a gradually realized context. 19 Working within the general Saussurean conception, Mukařovský finds a dialectical tension between semantic openness and closure- which is essentially a dialectical opposition of syntagmatic and paradigmatic elements- at precisely the place where Jameson finds a synchronization of the diachronic: "Semantic statics and dynamics are two forces mutually opposed but nevertheless intrinsically linked, and together they create the basic dialectic antinomy of every semantic process."20 If we recall the importance of narrative completeness or closure to Jameson's critique of Propp, we may begin to discern a recurrent feature: At the same time that Jameson seeks to open the work to history, he seems to need to close it on itself, to terminate the temporal development of the object of study. The reasons for this will appear more clearly after a consideration of the structuralist doctrine of textuality and the rela- tionship of totalization to history itself. Jameson argues that the slippage from form into content observed in Form- alist practice reappears in structuralist analysis when the concept of binary opposi- tion is generalized beyond phonology and is re-inscribed as an analogy to discourse in general. Every work is then understood as though it were a single sentence or message, and the structuralists come to see its content as Language itself, just as the Formalists came to see the work as the allegory of its own production. What is most troublesome about this is the consequent entrappment of criticism within a single causal series: All that Language as a transcendental signified can do is to understand history as one particular mode of discourse, and it remains gaping with amazement before a succession of forms which history itself understands simply as the life cycle of capitalism, from mercantile to post-industrial stages.

However the notion of "history itself" is severely challenged by this philosophical position. For surely "history" is the language which mediates an individual subject and a collec- tion of lived events that have been rendered as narrative for the purpose of com- municating and preserving them. (We may here refer back to Jameson's ontological distinction of synchrony and diachrony cited above.) As Hay den White suggests, "In any field of study not yet reduced (or elevated) to the status of genuine science, thought remains the captive of the linguistic mode in which it seeks to grasp the outline of objects inhabiting its field of perception."21 Marxist history, aspiring to the status of a genuine science, thus faces the task of somehow stabilizing the rela- tionship between history proper- that is to say narrative- and the sequence of actual events. This is facilitated by the structuralist problematics of language and the subject.22 Jameson places structuralism within a historical context by elaborating the historical preconditions of its appearance. Thus structuralism's dissolution of the subject into relativity reflects a "distorted awareness of the collective character of life, . . . the mass production commercial network into which our individual existences are organized" (PHL, p. 196). But while it is true that modern and 21. Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth Century Europe (Baltimore and London: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1973), preface, p. xi. For White's discussion of Marx see pp. 281-330. White's formal analyses of some major nineteenth-century historians and philosophers of history disclose the constitutive contribution of four linguistic tropes (metaphor, metonomy, synecdoche and irony) to the historical narrative and argue against the possibility of epistemologically confírmable access to a true chronicle of events: "We apprehend the past and the whole spectacle of history-in-general in terms of felt needs and aspirations that are ultimately personal, having to do with the ways we view our own positions in the ongoing social establishment, our hopes and fears for the future, and the images of the kind of humanity we would like to believe we represent. As these felt needs and apprehensions change, we adjust our conceptions of history -in-general accordingly. It is not with history as it is with nature" (p. 283). For an application of White's views to literary history see his "The Problem of Change in Literary History " NLH, 7 (1975), 96-111. 22.

Subsequent references will be incorporated in the text with the abbreviated title, "ISL." Jameson takes an interesting approach to this question by identifying history with Lacan's "the Real," which Jameson sees as emerging from the dialectical interaction of the Imaginary and the Symbolic: "If we can have an idea of it [the Real] , it is objected, then it has already become part of our representations; if not, it is just another Kantian Ding-an-sich, and we can probably all agree that the particular solution will no longer do. Yet the objection presupposes an epistemology for which knowledge is in one way or another an identity with the thing: it is a presupposition peculiarly without force over the Lacanian conception of the decentered sub- ject, which can know union neither with language nor with the Real, which is structurally at a distance from both in its very being. The Lacanian notion of an 'asymptotic* approach to the Real, moreover, maps a situation in which the action of this 'absent cause* can be understood as a term limit, as that which can be both indistinguishable from the Symbolic (or the Imaginary) and also independent of it" (387-88).</page><page sequence="11">JAMESON'S CRITICAL NARRATIVE 269 post-modern art have thematized language and its constraints upon thought, and indeed that our present, conscious concern with auto-referentiality reflects our present social and historical situation, criticism need not confine itself to the conscious or intentional or thematic content of its objects. Deconstructive criti- cism, for example, is less interested in self-conscious auto-referentiality as theme, than in the involuntary hypostases of linguistic forms in earlier discourses (or for that matter in Jameson's use of the term "history" discussed above).23 While the coming to consciousness of what Jameson calls the slippage of form into content is historically conditioned, the phenomena itself is more difficult to place. Gravity was created neither by Newton nor Einstein, yet its reduplication in human thought was transformed by each. Though the "universal laws of gravitation" and "general relativity" were creations of specific historical utility, the phenomena they modelled are not. The historicity of such modelling systems (including the linguistic) attests to the extreme difficulty we encounter when attempting to codify a "real" series of events as history. While our current preoccupation with auto-referentiality is certainly historical, the ontology of the phenomena is more difficult, perhaps impossible, to evaluate, and Jameson's own affirmation of a referent, his insistence on an approach to the "real" should lead to a careful con- sideration of whether or not auto-referentiality is an imputation of our current ideology or a condition of the work itself. It is not obvious that his historical ac- count of modernism is an adequate explanation of structuralism's "discoveries." The epistemological issue may be approached via the structuralist notion of textuality, which Jameson describes as "a methodological hypothesis whereby the objects of study of the human sciences ... are considered to constitute so many texts which we decipher and interprety as distinguished from the older views of those objects as realities or existants or substances which we in one way or another attempt to know. "24 The advantage of this notion is the attention it focuses on the analyst or reader or interpreter. It thereby functions as a corrective to positivism which is less provisional than phenomenological bracketting. Strangely enough, Jameson finds the concept of textuality most troublesome in the one area in which it should be most natural, literary studies. This is because from the point of view of textuality, the literary object is text, a product of the perpetual production of sentences or infinite semiosis, rather than an organic whole marked by formal com- pleteness. Here again we see the tension between open and closed forms which emerged in reference to Propp's fairy tale narrative and the possibility of semantic openness within Saussure 's conception of syntagm and paradigm. The concept of text obscures the boundaries that delimit objects of study, thus complicating the task of a complete or totalized criticism.25 23.

The text is then recovered by viewing the work as the production of five codes operating beneath the apparently smooth surface of a Balzac novella. Not only does Barthes posit a tension between text and form, he also valorizes the text by identifying attachment on the part of the reader to the formal amenities of the lisible text as "something like the aesthetic equivalent of the quasi-theological need for certainty of bourgeois thinking in general" ("IT," 225). Thus we have arrived, by a rather sophisticated route, at something rather like Shklovsky's hierarchy of device and motivation, and, once again, the modern text is praised for its lack of motivation, its courageous refusal to conceal the process of text production, for "laying bare the device." Jameson argues that "code" may refer to either a unified sign system through which a message is conveyed or the multiplicity of different codes contributing to a given communication. If the term is used in the first sense, then the critic ought to "show the unity the sign system or code utilized in the transmission of a given message." If it is used in the second sense, he should "reveal the contradictions and inconsistencies between the multiple codes in such a way as to make those contra- dictions and that multiplicity available to us as a phenomenon for analysis in its own right" ("IT," 216). Barthes is chastized for doing neither of these things. How- ever, the first option would presuppose the treatment of the work as a completed, perhaps univocal, message; whereas the second would either draw the discussion into a-textual causalities in which the same problems would be re-encountered or, truer to the textual concept, generate a metacode under which other codes are hierarchized and organized: in other words the processes of infinite semiosis would be further demonstrated. Thus both formalism and structuralism resist the explicit insertion of literature into a causal series extrinsic to it. It should be emphasized, however, that Jameson avoids the vocabulary of direct causation, which he asso- ciates with vulgar Marxism. Yet the totalized account he seeks to give, while it avoids the reduction of one-to-one cause and effect relationships, defines something of a causal field in which one element (or group of elements) may be seen as enabling another.27 proposé par la pratique sêmiotique donêe, est orienté dans le sens des ruptures historique qui renouvellent la société.

"The infrastructural series (development of social life, evolution of the mode of production in question, and so forth) does not cause the individual work which reflects it to come into being: such a work is the symbolic response of an individual consciousness to his historical circum- stances, and as such, dependent on the vicissitudes of individual life, might just as well have remained unwritten.

For, while refusing the surface phenomena of narrative, structural analysis has been unable to translate into its own terminology "the stubbornly anthropomorphic nature of our present categories of character. At this point, clearly, the problem intersects with the vaster philosophic one of the historical nature of the Subject itself' ("IT," 217). The ramifications of this difficulty ex- tend beyond the problem of characterization in narrative to become the substance of the structuralists' (or post-structuralists') critique of representation, which ac- cording to Jameson, leads them "to denounce the active and in -forming presence of the subject precisely in those texts in which it is repressed; on the one hand, they denounce its forgetfulness of itself, and on the other, they call for its sup- pression" ("IT," 238). 28 Jameson argues that the "attack on the old bourgeois subject can take two forms: that of the attempt to dissolve the subject altogether ... or the other quite different solution which would consist of renewing the primacy of the group and of collective life over the bourgeois optical illusion of individual existence, and returning to a view of the individual subject as a function of the collective structure" ("IT," 239). For Jameson the alienation of the subject, manifest in the failure of con- temporary discourse to find a stable place for it, is not a condition of man, but a condition of our present historical circumstances. The opposition between the bourgeois subject and the dissolution of the subject is resolved by a specifically diachronic mode of thought that reaches toward a third possibility not present at this time : The solution can only lie, it seems to me , in the renewal of Utopian thinking , or creative speculation as to the place of the subject at the other end of historical time , in a social order which has put behind it class organization , commodity production and the market , alienated labor , and the implacable determinism of an historical logic beyond the control of humanity . ("ISL," 393)29 combinatoire is rather one of exclusion than of production: the historical moment blocks off a certain number of formal possibilities which had been available in earlier situations, all the while opening up certain determinate new ones which may or may not then come into being. To put it another way, the combinatoire aims at revealing, not the causes behind a given form, but rather the conditions of possibility of its existence." See also Marxism and Form, pp. 344- 45. 28. See Michel Foucault, The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences (New York: Vintage, 1973), pp. 3-16. It seems to me that this elusiveness of the subject is not a paradox within Foucaulťs argument, but rather what his argument discloses: "A discourse attempting to be both empirical and critical cannot but be both positivist and eschatalogical; man appears within it as a truth both reduced and promised" (Op. cit. p. 320). 29.

Without an enclosing narrative, the semantic openness of history itself makes it impossible to fully evaluate the "meaning" of an individual act. The drawing of boundaries around history is rather like the drawing of boundaries around texts: it fixes mean- ing and offers the object up for interpretation. If the present state of consumer capitalism enables the negation of the subject, it is Utopian thinking that negates the negation: but at the expense of bundling the new collective subject off to the other end of historical time, which, because its infrastructure is differently organ- ized, will offer release from the always-already -given. But this means history, upon which truth is to be grounded, is itself a narra- tive, a text. In reply to this objection, Jameson argues: History is not so much a text , as rather a text-to-be-( re ¡-constructed. Better still , it is an obligation to do so , whose means and techniques are themselves historically irreversible , so that we are not at liberty to construct any histori- cal narrative at all . . . and the refusal of the Marxist paradigm can generally be demonstrated to be at one with the refusal of historical narration itself or at least , its systematic pre-preparation and strategic delimitation. ("ISL," 388) Thus it becomes clear why the Marxist polemic against formalism and structuralism here takes the specific form it does: resistance to synchrony, to binary opposition, to textuality amounts to defense of narrative, of limits, of determinable meaning. But a question remains as to whether or not the issue of historical narration can be disentangled from that of access to a reality beneath the hypostases of the narrative. It seems clear that a subject so de-centered as to refuse all historical narration sim- ply could not live, for it is through a sort of historical narration (though I suspect it is, for most of us, a discontinuous narrative) that we locate ourselves either in the world or in the web of signifiers. It is through our personal historical narratives that we recognize ourselves. Yet history, collective or individual, is itself subject to trans- formations, many of which Jameson points out. Given the necessity of constructing narrative history from a chronical of events never simply given, but always pre- formed, Hayden White's suggestion that "the best grounds for choosing one per- spective on history over another are ultimately aesthetic or moral rather than epistemological" requires serious attention.30 Language is in history ; but, so too, is history in language, and the preference for the Marxian narrative (from among the possible readings of the historical "record") is not easily separated from the con- stitution of the subject who selects it. 30.
