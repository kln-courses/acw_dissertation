<plain_text><page sequence="1">History of Religions the ordination (Upasam.pada), the regular recitation of the disciplinary rules (Pdtimokkha), the judgment by local communities of bhikkhus as to whether its members have adhered to the discipline (Pavdrana), and the receipt by deserving ("pure") bhikkhus of robes following the end of lent (Kathina). The ordination rite permits the Sangha to screen out those unsuitable to be "sons of the Buddha" (e.g., those afflicted by infectious diseases, those deformed, those still in the service of a king, those not human, and so on) and to invest those who are admitted with identities "forged by the Buddha as perceived from within the bhikkhu tradition" (p. 109). The other rituals serve both to determine the "purity" of the members of the order and to display, in the Kathina rite, this purity to the laity. In his conclusion Holt observes that the charisma of the Buddha has been perpetuated historically not only in the disciplined Sangha who maintain "the Dhammakdya of their master" but also in relics that constitute the rupakdya of the Buddha (p. 142). While one might wish for further discussion of the tension between these two forms of Buddhist charisma since it is so central to subsequent Buddhist history, Holt is justified here, I believe, in only raising the issue. For those who pursue the issue, Holt's book is to be recommended as an essential point of departure. CHARLES F. KEYES University of Washington UNRAVELING FOLK SHINTO THROUGH ARCHITECTURAL SYMBOLS Bauform als Zeichen und Symbol: Nichtdomestikales Bauen im Japanischen Volkskult. By NOLD EGENTER. Zurich: Eidgen6ssische Technische Hoch- schule, 1980. Among the fascinating aspects of folk Shinto in Japanese villages today is the great variety of local cultic practices involving the construction of temporary structures or monuments out of reeds or bamboo and their use in festivals associated with the local shrine. Often they are discarded soon after, or even destroyed as part of the festival. In interpreting these temporary cultic structures, ethnographers and scholars of Shinto have usually tried to associate them with cults of local shrine gods or seasonal agricultural festivals. Nold Egenter takes a very different and unusual approach to the inter- pretation of this facet of folk Shinto, with the result that he has managed to put forth a host of new suggestions. His interest is in the material, the construction techniques, the form and the symbolism of the monuments themselves. Thus he presents in this book an architectural-ethnological investigation which seeks to understand them not in terms of their relation to other facets of the Shinto cult but from the point of view of their material and technical development. This viewpoint, Egenter feels, can cast fresh light 89</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews on the development of folk culture in Japan from its earliest stages, freed from impositions of the national cult and other later religious developments. Egenter's investigation is based on fieldwork which he did from 1972 to 1976, concentrating on temporary cultic structures and festivals in the region of Omihachiman near Lake Biwa and including about one hundred sur- rounding villages. He considers this naturally bounded area to have remained an "isolated sphere" in terms of cultural history and thus to have preserved very ancient practices side by side with the imposition of more modern ones. One of Egenter's main theses is that these temporary structures, when studied objectively in terms of their material and techniques of construction, will yield important information about the original layers of Japanese culture and religion. By systematically identifying the original elements-on the grounds of material and technique-a kind of cultural history can be recon- structed in which many of the ideas about gods and cults of fertility can be seen as later accretions. For, Egenter holds, the cults associated with regional or national gods and festivals represent layers of Shinto which have been attached to the autochthonic tradition because of social or political develop- ments. For this reason, he deals with the cultic structures and accompanying rituals not as integrated wholes but as agglomerates or accumulations of different layers of development. In unraveling these layers of accumulation and reaching the earliest autoch- thonic layer, Egenter lays down an important methodological presupposition: the most ancient circumstances are better preserved in the material tradition (Sachtradition) than in the ideal tradition (p. 38), although of course both are transmitted together. That is, the actual materials, technique of construction, and cultic behavior represent a material tradition which tends, at least in an isolated sphere, to be passed on relatively unchanged from the most ancient times. But the people's interpretation of these structures and cultic events tends to rationalize the meaning as they accommodate to the spirit of the times, tying very ancient practices to new layers of regional and national cults. Egenter thus feels it is fruitless to ask the local people about the spiritual motivation of the events, for their interpretations will be tied to later accumulations of tradition. Rather, the spiritual motivations which stand behind the most ancient cult are to be recovered from the forms of the cultic objects themselves and in the structures of order and meaning which are expressed in them. As Egenter follows through on this architectural-ethnological method of investigation, some interesting suggestions are put forward. He finds that the temporary structures are "survivals" of a most ancient cultic marking system which used primitive means of construction. Still today these same primitive materials are used: reeds, bamboo, rice straw, and rape. Further, no tools are used, only the hands, in the most original sense of "handwork." The resulting cultic structures are temporary, characterized by their perishability and inflammability-and indeed, the events of the festival usually lead to the destruction and, often, burning of the monument. From such material and building data, Egenter concludes that these monuments were originally part of a cult marking system involving their annual construction in connection 90</page><page sequence="3">History of Religions with the growth of new materials-a practice still found in some areas of Japan. It is true that around Omihachiman today these monuments are constructed for a festival and then immediately destroyed. This can be explained, he feels, through the conflict that was produced by the introduction of wooden construction from China, which obviously had no role in the annual cultic cycle. The conflict was resolved by subordinating the temporary monument to the wooden shrine and by making it even more temporary, building it and destroying it in the same festival, thus conflating the annual destruction-renewal cultic proceedings. Egenter finds that these monuments can be seen as signs for territorial entities and social groups of ancient times. Thus the monuments can help in reconstructing the settlement history of the villages, starting with only a temporary cultic structure in a reed plain, going through phases of additional family huts and sacred woods, finally reaching the stage of a permanent wooden shrine with the temporary structure built in front of it only during the festival (fig. 68). Egenter draws many conclusions from the form of these cultic structures, which is very abstract and geometric. The form depends strictly on the material and the construction techniques. The basic form is not simple but membered, combining Dionysiac and Apollonian elements in a clear dualistic structure. Divided by the binding rope, the upper part is flexible, empty, unlimited, free; but the bottom part is stable, compacted, limited. These bundles of opposite pairs, Egenter holds, represent the most general ranks of concepts by which ancient man comprehended the world. This dualism of the formed and the not-formed plays a part also in the accompanying ritual and music; it must therefore be the essential "ground-structure" of the symbolism, giving the primal sacral meaning to the monument. It is this "genetic underground" based in the form of the cultic construction which then provides the motivation for the human spirit to compare, analogize, and symbolize, producing what Egenter calls "relative symbolism"-the various types of anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, mythic, cosmic, sexual, temporal, and numerical symbolism. But, he insists, the symbolizing movement is always from the basic structure to the relative symbol, not the other way around. This discovery, he feels, has implications for the study of all symbolic creations and, in fact, for searching for the origin of the religious impulse itself (pp. 11, 66-69). Amidst this wealth of field data, drawings, diagrams, photos, method- ological discussions, and interpretative suggestions, many interesting chal- lenges are found-and also, understandably, quite a few questions arise. For example, Egenter's confidence that he can establish the most ancient or original layer must be called into question. He simply states that he will consider the standing, anchored monument type as the original, with the others derived from it. He insists that a type of monument which is spread over a larger region is always secondary, while the type found only locally is primary. Any connection with cults of gods or spirits he likewise always considers secondary to some primordial spiritual motivation implicit in the material and the form of the monuments themselves. Such unsupported 91</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews methods for asserting primordiality raise some doubts about the reliability of his reconstruction of the accumulated stages of cultural history. Further, Egenter's view of religio-historical research is curious. He is of the opinion that Religionswissenschaft as a discipline proceeds from theolog- ical presuppositions, and thus it seeks only to relate these cultic structures to residences of gods or calls them fetishes or idols (pp. 11, 21). Because he considers the ideas the people themselves have about the meaning of these structures and rituals to be later accumulated layers of interpretation, he discounts the concern of Religionswissenschaft to understand the structures and rituals at least partially in the context of the people's own self- understanding. It is true that Egenter's method of separating the material tradition from the people's interpretation of it can lead to some surprising and challenging results, as witnessed by Egenter's own work, and historians of religions could learn much from this methodology. Yet I wish that, along with the rich and extensive descriptions Egenter provides of the monuments and cultic activities in these villages, he would also have included more details about the villagers' own interpretation of these ancient traditions. In spite of these questions, the book is an important addition to research on folk Shinto and ancient Japanese cultural development. The wealth of material presented here should be valuable to all who are interested in this area. THEODORE M. LUDWIG Valparaiso University LIGHT SHED ON THE CITY OF LIGHT Banaras: City of Light. By DIANA L. ECK. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1982. Pp. 427 + xvi; maps, illustrations, and photographs. This book is a reflection on the Hindu religious tradition from the point of view of Banaras, the most sacred city of Hinduism. Reflecting on the Hindu tradition from this angle of vision is revealing. A striking feature of Hinduism is immediately apparent, namely, what Eck calls the "locative" nature of the tradition. Hindus have affirmed for centuries that the sacred is located and accessible at specific points in the world (especially India, which is equated with the world in the traditional view), special places called tTrthas (literally crossing points, or fording places on a river) where it is possible to cross from this world to other worlds (divine, mythical, sacred worlds), where it is possible to experience sacred power intensely. Hinduism is strongly rooted in the soil of India, in the Hindus' love for their homeland, and of all places within the Indian subcontinent Banaras is probably the most widely and intensely loved. Eck shows very nicely the priority that the sacrality of Banaras (and by extension other sacred places) has for Hindus by narrating the many myths concerning the city's origin and history. In these stories a striking theme 92</page></plain_text>
