<plain_text><page sequence="1">Between Between Fear and Freedom: Essays on the Interpretation of Jeremiah Jeremiah 30-31. By Bob BECKING. Pp. viii + 338. (Oudtestamentische Studien, 51.) Leiden: Brill, 2004. ISBN 90 04 14118 9. €90/$120. THE book offers a translation and structural analysis of Jer. 30:1-31:40 and five exegetical studies of Jer. 30:5-11; 30:12-17; 31:15-22; 31:29-30; 31:31-7 respectively. It is designed to throw new light on the sequence of visions for a future of Jacob (Israel) in its land and the culmination of this sequence in the idea of a new covenant. As the subtitle indicates, the studies (PP■ 272־35ג) are revised versions of earlier essays, published between 1989 and 2003. Becking advocates a shift in methodo logical orientation in Old Testament exegesis. While historical issues, including the question of the literary growth of individual texts and the redaction history of a wider literary complex, are reduced to a question of 'context' and find a very general answer (cf. esp. pp. 242, 275, 300), the emphasis is now put on the literary shape and conceptual coherence of a text. From this starting point, Becking devotes chapter 3 to the macrostructure of Jeremiah 30-1 and the microstructure of its several components (pp. 49-134). The entire sequence of texts is regarded as one unified poetic composition, a 'canto', which consists of ten 'sub-cantos' A-J (plus an introduction, 30:1—3, and an 'envelope', 30:4 and 31:26). Each of these comprises a number of 'canticles' which in turn comprise a number of 'strophes' consisting of a number of 'lines'. The advantage of the suggested system is its unlimited flexibility. The character of the 'lines' is such that even a prose text can be construed as a 5 The Author 2006. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

What is striking about this system is the fact that—despite a cautionary note on p. 50—it is intended to be an analysis of a purposeful compositional structure of the text rather than an attempt to make a given text suitable for a liturgical reading. Furthermore, it seems far from obvious that the programme of 'delimitation criticism', for which Becking refers to M. C. A. Korpel and J. C. de Moor's study of Isaiah 44-55, The Structure of Classical Hebrew Poetry (1998), should provide a functional methodology for explaining the origin of a text in a single act of composition rather than through an extended process of literary development, and the problem of a conceivable adaptation of compositional structures through secondary additions is not considered. The structural analysis of Jeremiah 30-1 leaves room for variations at every level, and Becking does in fact not claim to offer anything but a proposal (p. 73). One may ask, for example, why in Jer. 30:10 (sub-canto A, canticle III, strophe 1) the statement 'and Jacob will return and will enjoy quietness and will be at ease' (wesab ya 'aqob wesaqat wesa 'anan), with its suggestive repetition of sounds, followed by the assertion 'and there will be no-one to frighten him' (we'en mah arid), should be divided up into three lines: wesab ya 'aqob / wesaqat wesa wesa נanan / we'en mah arid (pp. 75, 92) rather than two lines: wesab wesab ya 'aqob wesaqat / wesa \anan we en maharid (W. McKane, Jeremiah,Jeremiah, vol. 2 [1996], p. 755), if not even two lines in accordance with the sound pattern. In dealing with prose, or heightened prose, as poetry, it is even more difficult to reach a plausible delimitation. Why should, for example, 31:1 be read as a 'strophe' of three lines: 'At that time—oracle of Yhwh—will I be the God / of all the families of Israel / and they shall be my people' (pp. 79, 96, 113)? Another controversial point is Becking's use of the notion of 'parallelism'. While all sorts of corresponding expressions or grammatical features between lines, strophes, and canticles are classified as parallelism (e.g. 'hands' and 'face' in 30:6; see pp. 90-132 passim), a parallel in heightened prose such as '1 shall put my law within them and write it on their hearts' in 31:33 is broken up in order to suggest for v. 33 a translation: '1 will lay my law within them and on their heart I shall write it that I shall be a God to them and they shall be to me a people' (meaning that the assertion of mutual loyalty will be inscribed onto the</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 587 heart; pp. 246, 263). No less confusing is the explanation of 'breaking the yoke' and 'bursting the ropes' in 30:8 as two distinctive themes (pp. 150, 164). Becking's major concern, however, is with coherence. Again and again he states that each sub-canto was a coherent unit, and the five case studies are designed to prove this claim. Predictably this emphasis on coherence has the consequence that the more complex a 'sub-canto' is, the simpler will be the thought which, as a common denominator, is seen to provide 'conceptual coherence' to the whole. Thus in conclusion of his investigation of 30:5-11 Becking states 'The conceptual coherence of Jer 30.5-11 can be formulated as follows: Yhwh will bring his oppressed and anguished people to a new situation of salvation by breaking the yoke and the bonds of the oppressor' (p. 164) Although in the preceding paragraphs some more nuanced observations can be found, the tension between v. 10 and v. 11 (cf. Jer. 46:27-8) is nowhere discussed. However, it is one thing to announce that Jacob will live safely in his land 'and no-one shall make him afraid' (v. 10), and quite another to make Yhwh declare, '1 will make an end of all the nations among which I scattered you' (v. 11). The moral issue involved in this latter declaration cannot even be addressed where perceptive precision is suppressed by an insistence on conceptual coherence. A similar problem arises in the discussion of 31:15-22, a text which contains the name of Rachel (in v. 15, covering vv. 15—17) and that of Ephraim (in vv. 18—20). While it seems a serious possibility that the name of Rachel 'just like the name of Jacob in Jer 30-31' stands 'for the actual people of God: Israel', and that her weeping in Ramah 'is a prophetical-poetical rendering of the mourning for the Babylonian exile' (p. 202), it is far less obvious that Judaean exiles of the sixth century should have recognized themselves in a saying about Ephraim (cf. also 2 Kgs. 17:18). In Becking's elaboration on the two 'actants' in this sequence, Yhwh and Ephraim, this problem is not even mentioned (pp. 207-15; contrast McKane, loc. cit., pp. 796-803). His preoccupation is instead with the function of the 'canticle' vv. 18-20 as a connecting bridge within the 'sub-canto' vv. 15-22. Despite all emphasis on coherence, however, it does not become clear whether God is understood to act 'on the basis' of Ephraim's repentance (p. 215) or whether this repentance is precisely not 'a necessary condition for Yhwh's salvation' (p. 211; cf. pp. 251 and 260 for a similar inconsistency with regard to the place of forgiveness in relation to the new covenant).</page><page sequence="4">588 REVIEWS Becking's theological interest in this study adds 'changeability' as a third key term to those of delimitation and coherence. Taking his cue from W. Brueggemann's Theology of the Old Testament Testament (1997), Becking resolves the images of an 'inimical God' and of a 'loving God' into the anthropomorphic concept of 'changeability' (pp. 271-6, 298). Whether or not divine changeability is more fundamental than divine compassion remains an unresolved issue. A second layer of theological reflection is based on B. Lang's The Hebrew God: Portrait of an an Ancient Deity (2002), where the classic divine attributes of wisdom, power, and benevolence (in this order) offer a convenient scheme for an integrated view of the Torah, destruction and restoration (pp. 286—96). Finally, the assumed canto about these religious ideas in Jeremiah 30—1 is assigned to 'an anonymous prophet from his (sc. Jeremiah's) school who lived and preached in the second part of the Babylonian Exile', i.e. some time in the 550s BCE (p. 298). While the text-critical detail and comparative ancient Near Eastern material mustered cannot be reviewed here, it must be stressed that this rewarding study directs attention to many aspects of a fascinating biblical text which requires great sensitivity on the side of its readers. However, this reviewer sees no reason to privilege, with regard to historical criticism, a 'one scribe only' approach over a 'scribal school' approach, and, with regard to literary criticism, a hermeneutics of 'conceptual coherence' over a hermeneutics of a 'multiplicity of voices'. doi:doi: 10.1093/jts/flj097doi: 10.1093/jts/flj097 CHRISTOPH BULTMANN UniversitatUniversitat Erfurt Christoph.Bultmann@uni-erfurt.de Christoph Bultmann</page></plain_text>
