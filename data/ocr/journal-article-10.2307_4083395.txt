Ornithological Monographs, no. 5, American Ornithologists' Union. Pp. 1-156, 33 figs., 15 tables. Paper. $3.75 ($3.00 to A.O.U. members).- Woodpeckers are of special interest to many ornithologists. Their unique structural modifications and the peculiarities of their reproductive biology set them apart from other common groups of small birds. This monograph deals with four species of eastern North America: the Yellow-bellied Sapsucker (Sphyrapicus varius), Flicker (Colaptes auratus), Hairy Woodpecker (Dendrocopos villosus), and Downy Wood- pecker (D. pubescens), which the author studied intensively over a period of 7 years. Her observations on the sapsucker were most numerous (about 50 per cent of the total of 800 hours), with the remaining time distributed between the other three species. Most of the birds studied, except the Flickers, were color-banded. Mrs. Lawrence has compiled an impressive amount of information. Her detailed accounts of the year-to-year activities of marked birds (changes of territories, mates, etc.) strikingly illustrate the variation in behavior that may occur among individuals of a population and point out the value of long-term studies. Perhaps the greatest contributions of this work are those dealing with breeding behavior. The descriptions and illustrations of the "aggressive-social" displays of each species are highly useful and clearly indicate the relationship of aggressive and court- ship behavior. As descriptions of actual pair formation are not often reported, Mrs. Lawrence's observations are important contributions. She makes a strong case that close cooperation between the pair is essential for successful reproduction and presents evidence that not all woodpecker pairs maintain harmony. Kilham (Wilson Bull., 77: 134-145, 1965) likewise suggests that natural selection will favor those pairs most capable of cooperation throughout the long reproductive cycle characteristic of this group. The discussion of the mechanical means of communications, clarifying and expand- ing on the descriptions of other authors, is enlightening. Functions of drumming, displacement-drumming, displacement-tapping, and ritual tapping are discussed. Vocal- izations are described and categorized for each species, and calls described in the text are referred to specific cuts in the collection of sound recordings at Cornell University, a very useful idea. The book contains a wealth of information on breeding biology. Mrs. Lawrence convincingly proposes that light, and perhaps the warmth associated with it, is an important factor influencing location of the cavity entrance. Her conclusion that sex is unimportant in nest site selection appears questionable, judging from her data. The role of each sex in excavation, incubation, and brooding is shown by the use of histo- grams, and rates of feeding the young are illustrated graphically, as well as in tabular form. The author's style of presentation, making frequent use of anthropomorphic phrases, will be appreciated by some readers, whereas others will find it distracting. There are some minor contradictions and inconsistencies, but considering the scope of the work and the quantity of material presented, they are few. In general the illustrations are of mediocre quality and vary greatly in their significance. In summary, this work is an important contribution to the knowledge and under- standing of woodpecker biology. Most topics are well covered and a great deal of significant material is presented.-J.
