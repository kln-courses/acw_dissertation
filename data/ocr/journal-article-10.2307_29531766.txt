<plain_text><page sequence="1">KINSHIP AND GUILT IN MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN JOHN A. DUSSINGER When Mary Shelley, only nineteen at the time, joined the others in the Byron circle at Diodati in writing a "ghost story," the unlikely result was a myth of modern civilization that is almost as prophetic for present day readers as for those superannuated eighteenth-century minds who reacted in disgust to "the wild and hideous tale of Frankenstein."1 The subtitle, "The Modern Prometheus," indicates her intention of invoking the classical myth of human creativity to convey the spirit of the In? dustrial Revolution, which among other things exalted scientific inquiry, technological invention, division of labor, and surplus productivity as ends in themselves. But in contrast to one aspect of the Prometheus myth?the idea of social progress through the harnessing of energy? Mary Shelley's story casts a fatalistic gloom over the whole enterprise of individualistic striving for power and glory, and seems to urge the humbler values of one's moral responsibility to the family.2 Yet the didactic admonishment against overreaching is secondary to her interest in the hero as Prometheus bound, whose disintegration and suffering isolate him from all human relationships. Like most Gothic fic? tion, Frankenstein has loose ends, doubtless unravelings of the authoress's creative unconsciousness. George Levine has pointed out recently, however, that it renders powerfully the landscape of a single mind, with all the characters related functionally to each other. While the general conflict is between Frankenstein's ambition and the restraints of the human community, his intellectual pursuit is specifically a rebellion against the moral obligations between father and son: "The center of evil is parental irresponsibility and selfishness, and the ideal of goodness is the father's bond to his son and the reciprocal bond of son to father. As the aristocracy in France betrayed the people, so Frankenstein betrayed his creation and, at the same time, in cutting himself off from his own [38]</page><page sequence="2">FRANKENSTEIN / 39 family, betrayed his father as well." The purpose of the Monster as Dop pelg?nger is to embody the evil that results from this betrayal.3 Levine's interpretation goes far, I believe, in accounting for the ten? sion and unity of the work in terms of family kinship; but it oddly ignores the mythical allusiveness of the story?the scarifying projection of the modern individual's obsessive labor, repressive guilt, and Narcissistic longing. In this essay I want to explore the dark underworld of Franken stein, where the hero alone has travelled and subsequently destroyed himself. Much of the narrative is explicitly about evil, a dialogue, in fact, between protagonist, who experiences it from within as a daemonic force, and antagonist, who experiences it from without as a social injustice. Neither side wins, of course; but ironically while Frankenstein hardly un? derstands what possessed him to undertake his disastrous course except to blame the devil, the Monster enters the narrative as an enlightened reformer, convinced of man's original goodness. Levine finds the Monster's argument the more persuasive after conceding that "the un? derlying structure of the book implies an irrational and dangerous world, which cannot be comprehended by rational theory and which is strained with enormous energies latent and repressed."4 Obviously unless we can understand these hidden forces the Monster's rational explication of evil as deriving from parental irresponsibility and social injustice will neces? sarily take precedence. But the Monster is a unique creature without history, the incarna? tion of Enlightenment doctrines stemming from Locke, Rousseau, and the philosophies; and his narrative is really a fable to illustrate the mind's radical innocence as a tabula rasa. His naive demand, "Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous," hardly explains why Frankenstein, raised in an apparently ideal family, should have been destined to suffer so much misery. The whole structure of the novel implies that evil is mysteriously inherent in the mind and that no earthly relationship can ar? rest the need of some transcendent purpose in life. I Before turning to Frankenstein's relationship to his family and his longing for redemption from guilt, we should first consider his obsessive drive toward occult knowledge. All three truth-seekers?Walton, Frankenstein, and the Monster, in narrative order?complain of an over? powering instinct to be intellectually active. Of his almost suicidal ex? ploration of the oceans, Walton remarks: "There is something at work in my soul, which I do not understand. I am practically industrious?pains? taking;?a workman to execute with perseverance and labour" (p. 21). Like the Ancient Mariner, Frankenstein warns the novice against self</page><page sequence="3">40 / DUSSINGER consuming ambition: "I ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine has been" (pp. 29-30). In narrative retrospect he attributes his undoing to the mental process itself: "Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature, gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the earliest sensations I can remember" (p. 36). The Monster, perhaps the purest example of the Noble Savage in literature, also admits to the same intellectual compulsion: "Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind, when it has once seized on it, like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling; but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death?a state which I feared yet did not understand" (p. 120). "Curiosity" or the lust for forbidden knowledge is finally a rebellion against God, and Marlowe's tragedy reminds us that the medieval culture repressed Faustian individualism. If the quest for knowledge did not con? form to the authority of the Church, it could be condemned as the sin of pride or as presumption against the natural order of things. Furthermore, since the Judaeo-Christian Genesis account of Original Sin prevailed dur? ing the Middle Ages, it was only in the Renaissance that such writers as Ficino and Bacon could herald Prometheus as symbolic of the human spirit, the discoverer of fire, the founder of the scientific method and technological progress.5 By the eighteenth century the "modern Prometheus" is the spirit of natural philosophy, especially chemistry, whose adherents seemed to promise in the study of the elements and in experiments with electricity the fulfillment of the ancient alchemists' dream?the discovery of the elixir of life.6 Since the early years of the Royal Society the potential of modern science was already anticipated with fear and trembling among Christian moralists and ridiculed almost hysterically. Thus Swift's futuristic em? pirical projectors in the Third Voyage of Gulliver's Travels are madmen dabbling in excrement, hopelessly out of touch with reason and God's order. Frankenstein, however, is no mere projector. On the contrary, his insatiable curiosity originated in the occult sciences, not in conventional eighteenth-century natural philosophy. His interest in Albertus Magnus, Paracelsus, and Cornelius Agrippa (whom his father dismisses summarily as "sad trash") is explicitly against the limits of contemporary mechanics: "The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him, and was ac? quainted with their practical uses. The most learned philosopher knew little more. He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immor? tal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery" (p. 40). His basic im? pulse is to uncover the secrets of Nature, which Newton's laws had seemed to withhold from the instinctively inquisitive mind.</page><page sequence="4">FRANKENSTEIN / 41 The gulf between the subjective perception and the objective truths of Nature could not be wider for the lonely soul of the Enlightenment aspiring to communion with the godhead, hence the pervasive fear of madness and the defensive ridicule of enthusiasm.7 Instead of an anthropomorphic father-figure, there is only a mysterious presence. Michael Buckley summarizes Newton's deity: "God is above all quan? titative measurements; indeed he effects those coordinates which make measurements possible. Containing all things, he identifies with none and is affected by none, while no mass or movement suffers any change or resistance because of his omnipresence. By the same necessity with which he exists, he exists always and everywhere, [quoting the Principia] 'but in a manner not at all human, in a manner not at all corporeal, in a manner totally unknown to us.' " Life, according to Newton, is equivalent to mo? tion. God is brought from the First Cause of physico-theology to a con? stant presence, but a presence ultimately unknowable: "his existence and attributes are manifested in the phenomena of a world in movement; but men perceive and understand not the real substance of anything bodily, let alone the real substance of God... . God is known only by the system he has authored."8 In the era of Locke and Newton, Pope's Essay on Man could ap? plaud God's wisdom for setting boundaries to man's knowledge: "Why has not Man a microscopic eye? / For this plain reason, Man is not a Fly." But later in the century Blake viewed Newton's universe as a machine devoid of imagination: "The bounded is loathed by its posses? sor. The same dull round, even of a universe, would soon become a mill with complicated wheels." By 1815 Shelley's spirit of Alastor can address Nature as the ultimate object of his desires: Mother of this uinfathomable world! Favor my solemn song, for I have loved Thee ever, and thee only; I have watched Thy shadow, and the darkness of thy steps, And my heart ever gazes on the depth Of thy deep mysteries. I have made my bed In charnels and on coffins, where black death Keeps record of the trophies won from thee, Hoping to still these obstinate questionings Of thee and thine, by forcing some lone ghost, Thy messenger, to render up the tale Of what we are. . . . Like Alastor, Frankenstein has "obstinate questionings" about his origins, and he rejects the Newtonian model of Nature as a failure of imagination.9 His "curiosity" implies a painful sense of his separateness from this Nature; and his unconscious quest, therefore, is to regain the</page><page sequence="5">42 / DUSSINGER primordial wholeness lost at birth with the separation from the mother. In Frankenstein's fantasy the mysteries of the created world inhere in the mother as manifest Nature, while the laws of reason are attributed to the father, a parallel to the godhead withdrawn from the Newtonian machine. Furthermore, "curiosity" is the libido opposed to the father's mandate over the family and the Oedipal taboo against union with the mother. As myth, Frankenstein shows the child to be father of the man. Prometheus not only stole fire from Zeus and thus sacrificed himself for mankind: he also created man, or rather the human spirit, with all its destructive intelligence as well as restless striving for perfection.10 II The early chapters of the novel emphasize Frankenstein's blissful childhood and his family's perfect harmony until the mother's death and his subsequent departure for the university. Yet from the beginning of his intellectual awareness and growth there are hints of conflict with his father, particularly over the value of alchemy. Both the manuscripts of Frankenstein from the Abinger collection and the 1818 text reveal this conflict even more plainly than the 1831 text.11 Contrary to the later text ("My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a child's blindness, added to a student's thirst for knowledge" [p. 40]), Mary Shel? ley originally gave the father a stronger role in the family and an active interest in natural philosophy. Instead of reserving the evils of modern chemistry until Frankenstein met Krempe and Waldman at Ingolstadt, Mrs. Shelley had conceived his father as a prototype of the Enlighten? ment, a Ben Franklin (the name possibly suggested "Frankenstein"), who explains to him the principles of galvanism and even experiments with a kite and wire string besides constructing "a small electric machine." In other words, it was the father rather than the university professors who first overthrew his devotion to alchemy. Mrs. Shelley's remark in the Thomas copy of the 1818 text ("you said your family was not sientific [sic]") indicates her design of keeping the source of the father-son conflict more vague.12 From the interesting changes evident between the 1818 text (as well as the Abinger MSS. and the Thomas copy) and the "standard" text, it seems probable that Frankenstein's ambivalent attitude toward his father's influence during the childhood years reflects Mrs. Shelley's in decisiveness about her subject. On the one hand, he protests that the family was instilled with a perfectly liberal spirit: "Our studies were never forced; and by some means we always had an end placed in view, which excited us to ardour in the prosecution of them. It was by this method, and not by emulation, that we were urged to application." On the other</page><page sequence="6">FRANKENSTEIN / 43 hand, he felt constrained to hide his zeal for the alchemists: "I read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me treasures known to few beside myself; and although I often wished to communicate these secret stores of knowledge to my father, yet his in? definite censure of my favourite Agrippa always withheld me." So despite his glossy memory of life within the family ("the voice of command was never heard amongst us; but mutual affection engaged us all to comply with and obey the slightest desire of each other") the fact that he risks divulging his secret studies only to Elizabeth suggests the children's basic fear of the parental authority.13 Moreover, Frankenstein seems to implicate his father in the first dis? aster that strikes the domestic circle: When I had attained the age of seventeen, my parents ["father" below "parents" in the MS] resolved that I should become a student at the university of Ingolstadt. I had hitherto attended the schools of Geneva; but my father thought it necessary, for the completion of my education, that I should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country. My departure was therefore fixed at an early date; but, before the day resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life occurred?an omen, as it were, of my future misery [followed by "if I ohould proooouto my journey" in the MS] (p. 42). In contrast to Clerval, who must first overcome his bourgeois father's op? position to having his son attend the university, Frankenstein would have us believe that he was an unwilling, or at least reluctant, participant in the plans that somehow result in disease and death in the family. As though to tighten the vise of guilt over all concerned, the 1831 text shows the mother actually sacrificing herself when trying to save Elizabeth's life, while the 1818 text allows her merely the "imprudence" of entering the sick chamber too soon after her recovery. But against Frankenstein's traumatic sense of loss at the mother's death and his desire to remain at home, the father again imposes his authority: "My departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events, was now again determined upon. I obtained from my father a respite of some weeks. ["And all that I oould obtained from my father" in the MS] It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose, akin to death, of the house of mourning, and to rush into the thick of life" (pp. 43-44). This moment of the story is clearly slanted against the father for the mother's death and its apparent association with the son's departure. The narrator, it would be possible to say, wants to lessen his guilt involved in his secret rebellion against the enervating domestic order by attributing the decision to leave home to his father.</page><page sequence="7">44 / DUSSINGER The "irreparable evil" of his mother's death and his enforced separa? tion from his native land render him defenseless against the father sur? rogates whom he meets at the university?Krempe, who flatly rejects the imagination of the alchemists in favor of limited, scientific certainty, and Waldman, who praises insidiously the "modern masters" for achieving what the outmoded alchemists had attempted in vain. Images of scientific activity as a compulsive "dabbling in dirt" and an almost obscene "penetrating into the recesses of nature" complement Frankenstein's previous notions of alchemy. Thus in bringing back the youth's former dreams of glory and immortality, Waldman's lecture made him feel "as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy," the same as "the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the mo? ment I turned my reluctant steps from my father's door" (pp. 48 and 45, respectively). While keeping his "workshop of filthy creation" and dab? bling "among the unhallowed damps of the grave" (pp. 54-55), he deteriorates mentally and physically, oblivious to the natural beauty of the summer season in which he labors. Filth, decay, grave worms are the material for his work to create life, the material comprising "that most ir? reparable evil" associated with his mother's death. Just as he felt this evil to be related to his father's intention of sending him to the university, so there is a hint that his unconscious aim is to make amends for the loss of his mother: "I thought, that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time . . . renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption" (p. 54). In the heat of his efforts he remembers his father's peremptory words: "I know that while you are pleased with yourself, [the fear of los? ing authority over the son] you will think of us with affection, and we shall hear regularly from you. You must pardon me if I regard any inter? ruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties ["studies" in the MS] are equally neglected" (p. 55). But he forsakes his duty to communicate with the family because his work requires complete isolation: "I knew well therefore what would be my father's feelings; but I could not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. I wished, as it were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature, should be completed" (p. 55). This sense of postponing not only all "affection" but also any moral questioning of his pursuit implies the fundamental divi? sion within his mind between the instinct to create life autochthonously and the dependence on his father's approbation. Even in narrative retrospect Frankenstein remains equivocal about his great experiment despite its effects on the family: "I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice, or faultiness on my part; but I am</page><page sequence="8">FRANKENSTEIN / 45 now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from blame" (p. 55). His reluctance to accept his father's judgment here parallels his earlier behavior concerning alchemy; and the conflict, I suggest, involves an Oedipal rivalry for possession of the mother. Ill At first glance Frankenstein's interest in finding the elixir of life seems to be derived from his study of the alchemists. Yet he shows no penchant for transmuting base metals into gold and largely ignores the usual paraphernalia of the laboratory. Instead, the narrative focuses on his obsession with the phenomena of death. The secrets of nature which he penetrates are specifically the mysteries of decomposing bodies buried in the earth, which, to borrow from alchemical symbolism, are like all other buried material substances, whether metals, plants, and animals? embryos of the Earth-Mother, capable of transmutation from one state to its opposite (from death to life, from evil to good, from clay to spirit, etc.).14 The magnum opus or transmutation, the chief goal of the alchemists, was never a purely scientific effort but rather a mystical participation in the modalities of existence. The opus culminating in trie Philosopher's Stone usually required four stages, sometimes five, according to the colors of black (nigredd), white (leukosis), yellow (xanthosis), and red (iosis). Although projected onto matter, the operation amounted to an in? itiatory rite corresponding to the suffering, death, and resurrection of a God; and the whole effort is toward the perfecting of the material world, or in Christian terms, toward the salvation or redemption of the anima mundi held captive in base substance. Frankenstein's own deterioration while pursuing the magnum opus in his laboratory supports Mircea Eliade's explanation that the suffering and death?mortificatio, putrefac tio, nigredo?in alchemical symbolism may refer either to the person or to the material substance involved (Eliade, p. 152). The hero thus sacrifices himself as he "tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay" (p. 54). Mrs. Shelley avoided the many ambiguities of alchemical symbolism in writing this myth of birth and death. The materia prima of the "adept," for instance, the ultimately reduced substance of the material world, has some fifty identities, from sulphur, mercury, lead, to mother and moon (Eliade, p. 163). A more arcane symbolism of the primal substance related it to the return to the prenatal state, the regressus ad uterum. In the words of Paracelsus, "he who would enter the Kingdom of God must first enter with his body into his mother and there die" (Eliade, p. 154). In</page><page sequence="9">46 / DUSSINGER an appendix to the Opus Mago-Cabbalisticum et Theosophicum (1735) Georg von Welling repeats the Paracelsian idea that the whole world must "enter into its mother": "For I cannot otherwise reach the Kingdom of Heaven unless I am born a second time. Therefore I desire to return to the mother's womb, that I may be regenerated. . ." (Eliade, p. 155). The incest motif of the regressus ad uterum is also conspicuous in the Rosarium Philosophorum, with the myth of Beya swallowing up Gabricus in her womb in order to absorb him into her own nature. Beneath the alchemist's occult symbolism, it should be clear, is a central cosmological myth of initiatory death in the primordial state of matter as a necessary condition of rebirth, with the figure of the mother as the locus of harmony (Eliade, pp. 155-56). In view of this symbolism, it is possible to relate Frankenstein's at? tempt to achieve the alchemist's magnum opus by means of modern chemistry to his mother's death. His experiment succeeds in a scientific sense; he does activate a giant composition of limbs and arteries. But the result proves immediately horrifying, an unspeakable crime against nature rather than an act of spiritual regeneration, the promise of the alchemists. Something went wrong, but he fails to understand why: "I ap? peared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other unwholesome trade, than an artist [i. e., alchemist] occupied by his favorite employment" (p. 56). The contrast here between the alienated laborer and the inspired alchemist whose opus is an enactment of spirit underscores the life-in-death condition of the modern Prometheus. Frankenstein cannot return to the womb of Nature because his father's science cleaves the self irrevocably from primordial harmony with crea? tion. A commonplace in alchemical writing, as Carl Jung has demonstrated, is the necessity of a certain mental attitude in the "artist" while engaged in his work. An alchemist, Gerhard Dorn, comments in his "Philosophia meditativa": "Out of other things thou wilt never make the One, until thou has first become One thyself." The Rosarium Philosophorum also observes that the work must be carried out "with true and not with fantastic imagination." Another alchemist, Morienus, ad? vises: "This thing for which you have sought so long is not to be acquired or accomplished by force or passion. It is only to be won by patience and humility and by a determined and most perfect love. For God bestows this divine and immaculate science on his faithful servants, namely those on whom he resolved to bestow it from the original nature of things."15 According to Morienus, the necessary attitude of the adept is amor perfectissimus, or total concentration on the work, suffering, and medita? tion. Strangely enough, although, as we have seen, Frankenstein does</page><page sequence="10">FRANKENSTEIN / 47 sacrifice himself entirely to his labor, he nevertheless fails to "make the One." The adept must be spiritually reborn in the process to find the Stone. Far from any mystical redemption, Frankenstein's compulsive work and intense feeling of guilt intensify to the extent of madness. He cannot share the old alchemists' faith in salvation through spiritual effort because he is an offspring of the Enlightenment, which was to free man from primitive superstitions about the afterlife and to secularize labor for earthly improvement. Despite his early split from his father's repressive rationalism, his principal accomplishment is to raise the devil rather than the spirit of redemption. Alchemy had seemd to promise a way out of the gray world of Geneva, the model of scientific and economic efficiency for post-revolutionary Europe. But in such a world, rebirth, transcendence, are mere shibboleths of the Dark Ages. As Norman O. Brown has sug? gested, Luther's famous doctrine of justification by faith alone held remarkable insight for the capitalistic system evolving with the Protestant Reformation. While Western man became increasingly ensnared in an economy of surplus productivity and profit taking, he also lost hope for immanent salvation in renunciation, suffering, work: "as Luther said, the Devil (guilt) is lord of this world."16 Unlike the alchemist, modern man must labor in despair of eventual salvation. Hence, Frankenstein felt himself succumbing to the "Angel of Destruction" when undertaking his abominable task. Psychoanalysis has identified two schemata in the un? conscious for such compulsive activity: "the aim of possession or mastery over objects (Freud) and the principle of economizing in the means (Ferenczi). And the morbidity imputed to these schemata, if interpreted in the context of the whole libido theory, amounts to this: possessive mastery over nature and rigorously economical thinking are partial im? pulses in the human being (the human body) which in modern civilization have become tyrant organizers of the whole of human life."17 In Frankenstein these schemata operate ambiguously under the power of the "Angel of Destruction," the repressive father-figure who both urges the son on to possess knowledge as indifferent object and ob? viates his spiritual hunger for union with Nature. It is this evil force which conditions the irreconcilable conflict between individualistic ambi? tion and social responsibility. Frankenstein explicitly contrasts his Faus tian pursuit to master nature to the economic mode of accumulating: "Wealth was an inferior object; but what glory would attend the dis? covery, if I could banish disease from the human frame, and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death!" (p. 40). Though having ridiculed Clerval's father as "a narrow-minded trader," he comes to see the similarity between his intellectual overreaching and politico economic exploitation: "if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to in</page><page sequence="11">48 / DUSSINGER terfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not been enslaved; Caesar would have spared his country; America would have been discovered more gradually; and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed" (p. 56). This specific allusion to the plunder in the New World, reiterated later when the Monster weeps with Safie over the genocide of the Indians (p. 119), shows not only a remarkable historical consciousness but also a mythical apprehension of the individual's destructive instincts. IV Frankenstein's successful engendering of life is a traumatic rather than triumphant event, and not simply because of the creature's gro? tesque appearance. As the epigraph, from Paradise Lost, to the first edi? tion of the novel reminds us, he has created another Adam and must bear the responsibility of God and father toward this animated thing: "Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay/To mould me man? Did I solicit thee/From darkness to promote me?" Paradoxically, though his original motive was to gain absolute power over another being ("No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs" [p. 54]); he becomes virtually catatonic upon witnessing movement in this assemblage of corrupted flesh. Like Gulliver's horror at recognizing the relationship between Yahoo and human being, Frankenstein perceives suddenly that his kinship to the Monster cannot be denied, and yet that it cannot be acknowledged either. So long as he could work in complete isolation, indifferent to the natural phenomena as well as to his family, he had nothing to threaten his will to power. Without understanding fully the basis for his disintegration, Frankenstein has implied in his narrative the schizoidal condition described by R. D. Laing: The self then seeks by being unembodied to transcend the world and hence to be safe. But a self is liable to develop which feels it is outside all experience and activity. It becomes a vacuum. Everything is there, outside; nothing is here, inside. Moreover, the constant dread of all that is there, of being overwhelmed, is potentiated rather than mitigated by the need to keep the world at bay. Yet the self may at the same time long more than anything for participation in the world. Thus, its greatest longing is felt as its greatest weakness and giving in to this weakness is its greatest dread, since in participation the individual fears that his vacuum will be obliterated, that he will be engulfed or otherwise lose his identity, which has come to be equated with the maintenance of the transcendence of the self even though this is a transcendence in a void.18</page><page sequence="12">FRANKENSTEIN / 49 As soon as Frankenstein "saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open" he ceased to be safe in this vacuum but rather was forced instantly into a relationship that could engulf him. In contrast to the kind of transcendence sought in the magnum opus, where ideally the adept worked to free the pure spirit from drossy matter, Frankenstein's transcendence was actually withdrawal from his family into a void of detached objects and alienated activity. Just as he tries to deny to himself this creature's existence and retreats into delirium and illness, so as he hides his dark secret from everyone his Doppelg?nger carries out the ag? gressions that the moral self represses. Frankenstein's nightmare immediately after the creature's "birth" reveals surrealistically the unconscious transferences of identity in his return to the womb of Nature. Elizabeth appears before him in the bloom of youth and health; but when he kisses her, she suddenly withers and dies in his arms, turning into his mother's corpse, with maggots already visible on the shroud. This dream implies his schizoidal dread of engulf ment, contrary to the alchemist's dream of regressus aduterum. His hor? ror of the creature to whom he has given life is equivalent to his repressed fear of identity in the body, in the mother's body. Hence, even before the creature begins to kill, Frankenstein fears him as the embodiment of evil; and after William's murder, he admits his kinship as Doppelg?nger: "I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me" (p. 77). But why should Frankenstein have repressed desires to destroy his family, especially when he recalls his childhood as an almost perfect idyl? The answer, I believe, lies in the destructively aggressive tendency of the libido or the "Angel of Destruction" involved in his whole quest. Freud has defined the delicate balance between the individual's drives and the self-renunciation necessary to accomplish the ends of society: In consequence of this primary mutual hostility of human be? ings, civilized society is perpetually threatened with dis? integration. The interest of work in common would not hold it together; instinctual passions are stronger than reasonable interests. Civilization has to use its utmost efforts in order to set limits to man's aggressive instincts and to hold the manifestations of them in check by psychical reaction formations. Hence, therefore, the use of methods intended to incite people into identifications and aim-inhibited relationships of love, hence the restriction upon sexual life, and hence too the ideal's commandment to love one's</page><page sequence="13">50 / DUSSINGER neighbour as oneself?a commandment which is really justified by the fact that nothing else runs so strongly counter to the original nature of man.19 Guilt is a predominant reaction-formation in Western culture, to the ex? tent of visiting the crimes of the parents on the children in the myth of Original Sin; the implication, as Freud argues, is that man conspires against his own nature and submits himself to relationships that com? promise personal ambitions. The morbid effect of this arrangement is the pervasive feeling in civilized society that one must suffer for what he is rather than for what he commits. We have already noted a pattern of love/hate ambivalence in Frankenstein's relationship to his father. It began as the typical Oedipal situation?the unconscious desire to kill the father and possess the mother. But his autochthonous creation gives him a unique power over his family and seems to render sexuality trivial if not repugnant. Conse? quently, in the dream fantasy of the novel's world, the tenuous bonds that unite the community snap asunder as one by one "all that was dear to me" fall victim to his repressed hostility. By contrast to the aggressive instincts that civilization denies, the domestic circle of quiescent characters (Caroline, William, Ernest, Justine, the Agatha-Felix-Saphie group, Clerval, Elizabeth, and the father, who begins to wither away after the mother's death) appear to be innocent sufferers of the unnamed Monster. Yet they all feel guilt indirectly for the violence and death. Elizabeth, who already felt responsible for Caroline's illness, identifies with Justine in bearing the blame for William's death. Likewise, the townspeople reveal their collective guilt during Justine's trial by their wil? lingness to believe that Justine could murder the child, and the Catholic confessor merely institutionalizes the community's need of a scapegoat for human depravity. Despite the father's effort to repress the grief and guilt within the family circle, only Clerval shows a healthy freedom from compulsive drives and self-inflicted punishment, thanks to Elizabeth's softening in? fluence during childhood and later at the university to his conversion from the Western work ethic (originating in Homeric epics and medieval romances) to the transcendental poets of the East: "When you read their writings, life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses. . . . How different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!" (p. 69). Clerval is a perfect substitute for Elizabeth, therefore, to nurse Frankenstein back to health, "to love the aspect of nature, and the cheer? ful faces of children," after the Monster comes to life. Levine's point that "Clerval is, surely, Frankenstein without the monster" sums up nicely the function of this Shelleyan spirit who "occupied himself, so to speak, with</page><page sequence="14">FRANKENSTEIN / 51 the moral relations of things" (p. 38). Unlike Mary, who agonized over the frequent births and deaths in their circle, Percy seems to have fulfilled the Godwinian ideal of freedom from guilt.20 As the gap widens between Frankenstein's early endeavor to achieve by the defunct methods of alchemy the primordial harmony on the one hand, and his inability to undo the horrific kinship which his scientific ex? periment has established, on the other, his burden of guilt becomes in? tolerable. Despite the temporary respite enjoyed under Clerval's care, his new awareness of daemonic power displaces his former subordination under the family order. Guilt, Nietzsche propounded in Genealogy of Morals, stems from man's being bred an animal who makes promises: 'The feeling of 'ought,' of personal obligation ... has had ... its origin in the oldest and most original personal relationship that there is, the relationship between buyer and seller, creditor and owner: here it was the individual confronted individual, and that individual matched himself against individual."21 According to this formula, all social relationships, including family kinships, involve a neurotic binding of the future to the past, a system of giving and taking, of paying and owing, that perpetuates the authority of the creditor. Frankenstein's individualistic project ex? ploded this system of dependency which, in Nietzsche's view, means im? posing upon oneself a guilt no amount of punishment can remove. Though cultural anthropology may raise doubts about this theory of civilized man's "sickness," it is germane to the Frankenstein family in their relationship to each other. Frankenstein's reflections on the past as a time of integrated identity in contrast to his present situation show his schizoidal separation from any moral commitment. He remembers that he was born his parents' plaything and their idol, and something better?their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled their duties towards me. With this deep con? sciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity, and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord, that seemed but one train of enjoyment to me (pp. 33-34). The calculative credit/debit relationship stressed ("With this deep con? sciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life") and the parenthetical afterthought ("the active spirit of tenderness" of his parents) designate the optimum social contract that one enters at birth. In contrast to the usual tyranny in the eighteenth-century family</page><page sequence="15">52 / DUSSINGER his experience under patriarchal authority was almost free of conflict whatever. But as the story proves, the "silken cord" is more sinister than any harsh discipline externally imposed. This passage indicates the schizoidal split between the sense of "I" as a unity and as an object observed?"plaything," "idol," "creature," "the being to which they had given life," and in general as property protected by legal authority. The Frankenstein family is a paradigm of the social contract based on economic terms. Blood kinships are secondary to the indebtedness in? curred by promises exchanged for gifts (marriage, social identity, domestic service); though in the real world property is the principal means of organizing the family relationships, in this fantasy world guilt and dependence derive from the intense feeling of moral obligation between parents and children. Thus Caroline Beaufort had entered life with a widower-father, a merchant who went bankrupt and felt dis? graced thereafter. Not surprisingly, he dies prematurely from guilt and remorse, and M. Frankenstein, who had proffered aid in vain, comes upon a death scene worthy of Greuze. In fact, he even has a painting made of Caroline's poignant "agony of despair" to decorate his mantelpiece (p. 78), and implicitly to record the cathartic moment of female abjection which prompted his marriage to her afterwards. Having spent his youth as a bachelor in public office, he now becomes surrogate father and husband to the helpless orphan and retires to concentrate en? tirely on domestic affairs, sheltering Caroline "as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind" (p. 33). As in other romantic fiction, the relationship represents an ideal Oedipal harmony, but it turns nevertheless on unquestioned credit and unpayable debt.22 Yet Caroline takes an active social role as her husband fades into the background, and she tries to assuage her guilt by tending to the needs of the poor: "it was a necessity, a passion,?remembering what she had suf? fered, and how she had been relieved,?for her to act in her turn the guar? dian angel to the afflicted" (p. 34). It was a necessity! Moral sentiments do not come freely, the narrative implies, but depend on one's relationship and on the terms of the exchange. In imitation of her own good fortune, Caroline adopts a Milanese orphan, Elizabeth Lavenza (in the 1818 edition, the daughter of M. Frankenstein's sister), and then of? fers her as a "pretty present" to her son. His debt to his mother is boundless, and his possessive instinct toward Elizabeth, his "more than sister, since till death she was to be mine only" (p. 36), tends to fuse the mother with the mother's gift. The change in the 1831 edition to making Elizabeth an orphan outside the family lines only strengthens the parallel between mother and Fiancee, and of course between father and son. Caroline's deathbed request that Elizabeth substitute her place in the family and eventually marry Victor imposes further obligations that can? not be met.</page><page sequence="16">FRANKENSTEIN / 53 As we have seen, the creation of the Monster comes irrevocably between Frankenstein and his family. Christopher Isherwood's version of the story for television gave an interesting depth to this kinship between creator and created, with its hint of a homosexual attachment in conflict with the hero's promise to his mother and to Elizabeth. The successful autochthonous birth is clearly in conflict with the system of bisexual reproduction that justifies the family hierarchy. If, therefore, Franken? stein is a hero with a touch of divinity, as Walton reports, it is because he has risked everything to discover the libidinal being that threatens the moral self. His obsessive search for the elixir of life had from the begin? ning a Narcissistic destiny?toward death as the only return to the womb of Nature. When the pursuit motif reverses roles after the destruction of the entire family, when the hunted turns hunter, in other words, driven by a spirit of vengeance after his former paranoiac fears, the moral con? sciousness once again asserts control over the daemonic instincts. His final achievement, then, is a destructive authenticity, the radical in? dividuality highly valued in Western civilization, "The life-negating (ascetic) individuality of (Faustian) discontent and guilt."23 But Frankenstein dies as equivocally as he began life, in a vicious circle of wil? ling mastery over the power he unearthed and of renouncing that power in favor of tranquillity. Thus in his last breath he urges Walton contradic? torily to complete his revenge against the Monster in an all-or-nothing struggle and also to give up ambition and to seek domestic happiness (p. 217). Though Walton chooses the latter course while the Monster goes off to die, the ending of the story is necessarily ambiguous. As the lone survivor in this existential landscape of ice and snow, without the least sign of divine intervention, Frankenstein's uniquely created being aug? ments the sense implicit in this story that man himself has been aban? doned by his Maker and left a victim of his uncontrollable nature.
