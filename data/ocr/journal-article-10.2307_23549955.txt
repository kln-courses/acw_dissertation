<plain_text><page sequence="1">MODELS OF "THE BODY" IN THE ETHNOGRAPHIC FIELD: GARÍFUNA AND CANDOMBLÉ CASE STUDIES' Paul Christopher Johnson "The body" and "embodiment" are now firmly entrenched in the working vocabu lary of the study of religion, yet there is little consensus on what such terms mean. This essay reviews the widely varying uses, focusing on main trajectories of the "lived body", the "semiotic body", and the "productive and produced body". Since "the body" must always be set in a particular narrative strategy in any given ethnography, complications arise when the various, sometimes contradictory, uses of "the body" are not kept distinct or are presumed to be one. This essay presents case studies on how varying uses are actually implemented in writing ethnography, and calls for a return to clear specification of how and why "the body" is invoked. Introduction: "The body" animated Two decades after the "turn to practice" in the study of religion, the idea that consciousness is determined by life, rather than the inverse, is now standard (Marx 1970: 47). Consider the recent handbook of keywords, Critical Terms for Religious Studies (Taylor 1998). It comes as no surprise that the essays "Body", "Image", "Relic", and "Terri tory" focus attention on the body and its senses. Those same themes recur, however, even where they might not be expected: "Belief', once regarded as individual and intellectual, is described as "an idea that arises from a specific set of material issues" (Lopez 1998: 28). "Rationality" entails "the rejection of the Cartesian separation of mind and body", is thus "embodied" and, through this materializa tion, historically, socially, and politically situated: "one does not mas ter sorcery, history, or knowledge; rather, it is sorcery, history, and knowledge that master us" (Stoller 1998: 251-252). If such a handbook, along with a spate of edited volumes (Csordas 1994a; Law 1995; Coakley 1997) is any indication, the attention to "the body" has already become status quo in the study of religion, 1 Research for this article was supported by a National Endowment for the Hu manities grant. 1 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2002 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion 14, 170-195</page><page sequence="2">"the body" 171 above all for ethnographers who are faced with living beings to inter pret rather than texts, and who must do so through the mediation of their own senses. Such proliferation has not in itself, however, led to clarity as to what is entailed by "embodiment" and its companion terms, "bodying forth" (Jackson 1983), the "somatic mode of atten tion" (Csordas 1994a), "tactility" (Chidester 2000), "habit memory" (Connerton 1989), and the like. It appears, in fact, that the terms of "embodiment" have been imported into the study of religion in con fusing and even contradictory ways (T. Turner 1994: 44-46; Bynum 1999: 241-246 ). Does it refer to the scholar's physical presence in the field—her situatedness—and the fact that her observations are lim ited by her own senses, needs, and habits? Does it refer to the aug mented attention to ritual practice and physical action in place of texts and meanings? Does it entail the historical constructed-ness of even biology, the very biology that was once taken as explanatory ground zero, such that even gender itself should be read as a complex social text? Or does it refer to the importance of grounding compari son in human universals such as cognitive capacity, with the brain as its control center, or in universal human rights against the body's mistreatment? Is it the attempt to return to pre-symbolic, pre-verbal body itself, in all the richness of its sensual world before primary expe rience is objectified in language, or to analyze how very structured and constrained are even those aspects that appear, but are mis recognized, as individual improvisations? The confusion of possibilities is not surprising, since so many tribu taries could be named for the recent river of discourse. At the least, it is related to the post-structuralist attention to practice recuperated from Marx and Gramsci (Bourdieu 1977: 96; Ortner 1984; Comaroff 1985: 5; Alexander 1990: 23; Bell 1992: 75-76), the constructivist paradigm as it has been applied to gender, the existential phenom enology of Merleau-Ponty, the tension between structure and practi cal agency derived from, among others, the work of Foucault, Geertz, Bourdieu, and Sahlins (Ortner 1984; Alexander 1990; Sewell 1999), and a broader social context of the post-industrial transformation of aesthetics, leisure, and sexuality (B. Turner 1996). We could cite less obvious influences as well: in place of the uncritical invocation of "a religion", the attention to narratives and the specific agents and en acted "events" that construct them (White 1978; Sahlins 1985; Sewell 1996), and the problem of memory and its sensory mnemonics—how the experience of time and space is mediated by material forms and</page><page sequence="3">172 PAUL CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON the body's senses (Connerton 1989; Lipsitz 1990; Young 1993; Stoller 1995; Bloch 1998; Giard 1998). All of this complexity does not prevent us from nodding with approval when a colleague reports that he is "working on Islam and embodiment". Yet without some relative consensus on the meaning of such declarations beyond their discursive familiarity, they cannot advance the theoretical repertoire for a shared study of religion, however well they may serve the par ticular ends of particular projects. From one perspective, "embodiment" is a kind of resistance to theory, an attempt to resist premature reductions in order to allow religious practices and practitioners to disclose themselves (Kapferer 1997: xv-xvi). From another perspective, "embodiment" is a con struct through which scholars seek to reconcile the attention to local practices with the capacity to make theoretical claims. It is an analyti cal lens to uncover the ways in which large-scale social and historical forces are condensed in specific enactments; and, conversely, the ways structures and cultures only exist as a series of specific bodily acts, including speech. At least in this latter sense, the term ought to lend clarity and focus to abstract discussions on "culture", "struc ture", and "religion." It hasn't. The reason is that it serves both as a cipher for agency and a cipher of constraint. Thomas Csordas (1994b: 10-12) has given order to such variety by pointing out that "the body" usually falls into one of two, overlapping lineages: the semiotic or the phenomenological. From the semiotic perspective "the body" emerged into common parlance primarily through the studies of Foucault, who relied upon it as a dense index of institutional forces and discourses—hence the "political economy of the body"—and at the same time as a site of "resistance", however anemic such "resistance" may appear to critics (T. Turner 1994; B. Turner 1996: 231-232). It emerged simultaneously in phenomenol ogy, especially in the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, as a form of unstructured consciousness that grounds and precedes signs or mean ings, "the darkness needed in the theatre to show up the perform ance" (Merleau-Ponty 1962: 100), which allows understanding or intersubjectivity to occur at all. The middle ground between these trajectories, to my view, is one derived from the Marx of The German Ideology and the work of Pierre Bourdieu—neither the body con structed in discourse nor the body of consciousness, but rather the productive and produced body. In what follows, I summarize these uses of "the body" in the study</page><page sequence="4">"the body" 173 of religion, plus an additional four perspectives to illustrate the number of limbs this homunculus has grown. Thereafter, I evaluate its use in two examples from my own fieldwork that illustrate the two major trajectories—the semiotic and the phenomenological—as they are implemented in actual fieldwork narratives. I conclude by com paring the two applications to show that the meaning of "the body" is contingent upon the broader theoretical strategy it serves in any given ethnography. The essay does not aim to bloat further "the body," ample as it already is, so much as to demonstrate implica tions, and complications, for its use in the practice of fieldwork and writing ethnography. 1. Seven senses of "the body" Since everything we do, say, and think happens in a body, it seems reasonable to ask what "embodied" practices could possibly mean. There are, after all, no ¿¿¿embodied acts or experiences, other than fictional representations, from which to distinguish them. Though one might speak of "feeling disembodied", this is still a sensation generated in cells and synapses, and a report made by breath shaped by a wagging tongue. Nor have people become more "embodied" than they were before over the last decade as the term has gained in frequency, though one could plausibly argue precisely the opposite, that the discourse of "embodiment" ascended as the actual physical body's importance to work and leisure declined. Clearly, "embodi ment" is an analytical move, a shift in the gaze of the scholar. It is both a new subject of scholars' attention, and an explicitly situated mode of paying attention. If it is clear that "embodiment" refers not to a new category of phenomena, but rather to new categories of analysis and method, it is far from clear just what such an analytical category or method might include. Here are seven possibilities, concluding with the main trajectories named above: the semiotic, the phenomeno logical, and the mediating term of productive and produced bodies. They obviously overlap enormously in the practice of ethnography, and I artificially separate them only for heuristic purposes. 1.1. The implied but absent body Since ethnography is based on observing bodies (in both senses), they may be said always to be present, if not explicitly then tacitly sub</page><page sequence="5">174 PAUL CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON sumed in abstract categories. Prior to the current proliferation of "the body", this was standard ethnographic style. Consider the example of a well-known ethnographic comparison from the first half of the twentieth century. In 1934, Ruth Benedict published the classic Patterns of Culture, relying to a large degree on ethnographic reports gathered by others. The text elides the first level of ethnography, that of observing practices, as well as the second, that of assembling fieldwork notes into a first-hand ethnographic narrative. It begins rather with third-order summaries. The reader is inducted cursorily into selected aspects of the cultures of the Zuni, the Kwakiutl, and the Dobus. At a fourth level, these are compared with each other to reveal cultural disparities despite a shared biologi cal origin (Benedict 1934: 216): the Zuni are "Apollonian" by virtue of their tendencies toward moderation, sobriety, and the absorption of the individual within social norms; the Kwakiutl and Dobus, by contrast, are "Dionysian", preferring ecstatic, demonstrative modes of action and placing a high value on individual distinction and aggression. Though the elegance of her formulation makes the text good to think with and through, it is the comparative categories that remain memorable, since no social agents acting in real historical time and with physical presence appear here. This is a two-fold ab sence, since the text precludes both individual informants' individual physical presences and the ethnographer's subjective narrative voice. From a contemporary perspective, the problem is that just as any so-called religious act can be seen as a specific instantiation of struc ture, so structure is a series of individual bodily enactments. The implied (but out-of-frame) body remains a common approach for handling the issue, albeit by sweeping it under the rug. 1.2. The body as metaphor The approach most characteristic of the ethnographic study of reli gion has been the analysis of the body as metaphor. Here the body is viewed as an emic category that bestows order on the world. The sick body may be viewed as representative of cosmological disorder (e.g., Sullivan 1989; Lévi-Strauss 1966). Christ is the "head" of the church, and followers are appendages of a single body. The natural world may be represented in anthropomorphic terms, such that an Andean mountain is possessed not only of head and heart, but also of inner passages of circulation and various levels that must be maintained in</page><page sequence="6">"the body" 175 their organic unity through feeding shrines and through cross-level marriages (Bastien 1978: 37-50). The physical body, the social "body", and the land's "body" are cross-referenced in language and ritual action such that they become isomorphic with one another in a single integrated cosmos. In this approach, the body is used by scholars to convey the emic epistemology through which religious actors order the world. In tone and tenor, such an approach often regards this epistemology in a positive light, as cognitively and socially integrative. When religious practitioners view the world not only through the body, but as a body, they make it their own in a way that inspires envy from disen chanted modems. 1.3. The scholar's body The former phenomenological ideal of "bracketing" the ethnogra pher's presuppositions has been reframed as forthrightly declaring them and subjecting them to critique. As such, the question of an observer's situated-ness has become cmcial. The scholar must forego the idea of uncovering objective truth, declaring instead that their record is contingent, subjective, and "embodied"; that it is mediated by their particular, idiosyncratic sensory experiences, and by the motives of how, when, and why they come to see and record. Con sider, as illustrative, E. E. Evans-Pritchard's The Niter, first published in 1940, and Janice Boddy's Wombs and Alien Spirits (1989) as paradig matic bookends. Evans-Pritchard, often chided as the preeminent "disembodied" ethnographic voice, cursorily situated his methodical gaze in the text's introduction (1969: 14-15). After the introduction, however, apart from notes on a few black flies (1969: 67), Evans Pritchard's reflexive voice disappears from the text. Surely both his method and his corporeal state during fieldwork played a role not only in the how, but also in the what he documented, yet these re mained occluded behind the sheer wall of "objectivity". Compare now the relentless self-consciousness at the very outset of Wombs and Alien Spirits: "I am taken up, no longer really here, no longer aware of my foreignness, no longer aware of theirs. A hand reaches down and grabs my arm. Jarred to wakefulness, I stare at a black grinning face ..." (Boddy 1989: 3). The increased situatedness and subjectivity are dual, comprised, on one hand, of the "embodied" voice of the scholar in the text and, on the other, of the specific utterances and</page><page sequence="7">176 PAUL CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON acts of Boddy's informants in place of abstract yet discretely bounded societies like "the Nuer" or "the Hofriyati". This situated, or inter-subjective turn (Jackson 1998: 5-7) encom passes several concerns: the ethnographic Heisenberg Principle, an acknowledgment that what is observed is changed by the observer's presence; the postmodern rejection of unified, objectively determined truth; the postcolonial ethics of "studying the Other", such that no hierarchy is presumed between the observer and the observed (Rabinow 1985; Marcus and Fischer 1986); and the need to incorpo rate the senses beyond merely the visual into fieldwork. Hence Stoller enjoins scholars not only to describe the senses, but to awaken their own: "Stiffened from long sleep in the background of scholarly life, the scholar's body yearns to exercise its muscles ... it aches to restore its sensibilities" (1997: xi). 1.4. The discourse of the body A further use of "the body" in ethnography is that the category itself has taken on meaning. The academic attention to the category of "embodiment" is imbricated with wider social transformations that have aestheticized the body, such that its appearance, whether in style or in print, is what counts (Asad 1993; T. Turner 1994; B. Turner 1996). If the body's surface is now hallowed ground, so is "embodiment" as an object of investigation. Even the focus on the "constructed body" that serves as a condensed icon of social forces may not entail a rejection of transcendence or essence so much as a grasping after it. As Stuart Hall put it, "the body acquired a totemic value in post-Foucauldian work precisely because of its new talis manic status. It is almost the only trace we have left in Foucault's work of a 'transcendental signifier'" (1996: 11). There are hints here of the body viewed not merely as a vehicle of consciousness and action—however constructed and constrained—but also fetishized as an idea and value in itself. This is why virtually every current ethno graphic study of religion intones "the body", quite independently of direct relevance to the argument. Here the risk emerges that "em bodiment" may become no more than a buzz word to decorate analysis rather than carry it further. That is, while a nod to the idea and the discourse of "the body" is already de rigueur, it may be no more than pro forma. Since sensory phenomena are so eminently dif ficult to translate into the text forms that remain the primary format</page><page sequence="8">"the body" 177 of academic production, they may merely decorate a new aesthetics of ethnographic discourse rather than fundamentally alter the process of fieldwork itself. 1.5. The semiotic body The most influential meaning of "embodiment" is derived from the work of Foucault, for whom the body proffered signs that could be read to discern regimens of discipline and regulation: "the body is also directly involved in a political field; power relations have an immediate hold upon it; they invest it, mark it, train it, torture it, force it to carry out tasks, to perform ceremonies, to emit signs" (Foucault 1979: 25). The discipline located in professional and insti tutional forms produces subjected and practiced bodies, more power ful than ever in their utilitarian usefulness, less powerful than ever in their capacity to dissent or resist politically (1979: 138). Foucault's "body" swings in two directions, with medical science as the hinge: to the micro-politics of the control of individuals and to the macro politics of population control (B. Turner 1996: 63). Though, as we will see, Foucault shares with Bourdieu an atten tion to the body as it is constrained, this is not to say that Foucault and Bourdieu can be equated. Key differences in their view of social constraint include Foucault's rejection of Marx and social class as a central term of analysis compared with Bourdieu, and Foucault's extreme relativism compared with Bourdieu's "mediated universal ism" (Harker et al. 1990: 200) derived from Marx. Yet for both, the body is of analytical use because of how well it emits patterns of signs that cut through and extend beyond the unreliability of subjective experience. Both have likewise been critiqued on the basis of an impoverished idea of "resistance". Yet even Foucault acknowledged, in personal practice more than anywhere, the possibility of a "self' choosing to refuse epistemic classification and determination. Episte mes still require carriers, transmitters, and persuasive speakers, each of which implies the possibility of their refusal, negotiation, or char ismatic revision. Many other scholars have likewise viewed the body as a social text, such that the logic of social relations is "written into" the symbolic structure of the body (Douglas 1966: 115; Comaroff 1985: 7; Wafer 1991). What it is that the body indexes, of course, depends on the analyst's interests and categories: gender as it is constructed and re</page><page sequence="9">178 PAUL CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON sisted (e.g. Boddy 1989; Butler 1990, 1993), structural patterns of pollution and order (e.g., Douglas 1966; Hertz 1973), and institu tional disciplinary regimes (Foucault 1973, 1979, 1980). The "em bodied" social indices of the body may be presented as having "natu ral" referents: the father as the "head" of the family, where head is attributed a natural superiority. But they may, in other instances, be considered strictly cultural: food consumption, for example, has a logic independent from any natural references; there is no intrinsic reason that a dog should be less edible or tasty than a pig (Douglas 1966, 1975; Sahlins 1976, 1977; Lévi-Strauss 1980). In such cases the body and its habits construct a system with a purely internal, arbi trary logic. 1.6. The productive and produced body The perspective of the body viewed in its practico-sensuous activity derives from Marx, whose clearest statement on the matter appeared in The German Ideology. His topic is not bodies imagined or abstracted, "but as they really are, i.e. as they operate, produce materially, and hence as they work under definite material limits, presuppositions and conditions independent of their will" (Marx 1970: 46-47). Though Marx foreshadowed the phenomenological objective of un derstanding life-as-lived and the problem of consciousness, he also offered a forceful critique of such formulations. Consciousness is in separable from social relations and production, and must be always triangulated with these (Marx 1970: 50-52). While this, as we will see in a moment, seems consistent with the attempts of contemporary phenomenological ethnographers, Marx gave priority to the latter two points of the triangle: to production and social life. While a kind of primitive consciousness must be present—the consciousness of nature and of other beings (Marx 1970: 51)—to motivate production and social life, a fuller idea of consciousness arrives in his schema only as a fifth "moment". The need for food and water, the produc tion of more complex needs, the (re)production of family life, and then an expanded social life, all of these precede individual con sciousness (Marx 1970: 48-50). In regard to the triangle, if for pheno menologically oriented ethnographers the emphasis is on conscious ness as it precedes production and social life, for Marx the emphasis is the opposite—how experience, the "lived world", is produced. As pertains to the body and embodiment, it is in light of the legacy</page><page sequence="10">"the body" 179 of the German Ideology that I place Bourdieu. For Bourdieu, the indi vidual subject acts and feels only within solidly constructed walls of social constraint, if indeed he may be said to "choose" his acts at all. Indeed, despite all protestations that what he calls "strategies" are not to be confused with structural rules, for Bourdieu, "[t]he principles embodied in this way (learned by habit) are placed beyond the grasp of consciousness, and hence cannot be touched by voluntary, deliber ate transformation, cannot even be made explicit" (1977: 94, paren theses mine). The socially produced body's gestural repertoire is called hexis, taken from Aristotle (Bourdieu 1985:13; Swartz 1997: 108); the principles "embodied", taken as a set, are called habitus— a term most immediately inherited from Mauss (Mauss 1979; Asad 1993: 75-7). Individual consciousness arises secondarily, out of so cially reproduced "embodied" competencies that precede it, though it is always mis-recognized as unique. As is well known, Bourdieu's notion of the body acting within a habitus has been objected to as overly deterministic. Such a critique was levied, to wit, by Jean Comaroff (1985: 5), who characterized Bourdieu's social actors as "doomed to reproduce their world mind lessly" (cf. Csordas 1994a: 12; Swartz 1997: 109-113, 289-90; Burdick 1998: 12-13; ). Nevertheless, Bourdieu can be interpreted as having injected agency into structuralism, since the force of habitus is far from absolute (Bourdieu 1990: 108). The criticism of his overly deterministic model nevertheless remains and is one of the factors that has led to a revived attention to the "lived world". 1.7. The phenomenological body Beginning during the late 1970s, several ethnographers have taken the audacious step of proposing that we can and should "back up" from examining the body as a semiotic system or a site of social production to engage "the body itself': the pre-objective, pre-reflec tive body, the body-in-the-world from which consciousness, percep tion, and objectification begin (Jackson 1983, 1998; Stoller 1992, 1995, 1997; Csordas 1994a, 1994b; Kapferer 1997). Such is not a return to methodological individualism or the idealism critiqued by Marx, so much as a quest for inter-subjectivity. As Michael Jackson expresses the shift, "Being is conceived ... as Being-in-the-world—a domain of inter-est (inter-existence) and intercorporeity that lies between people" Jackson 1998: 3). Yet despite the concern for relational di</page><page sequence="11">180 PAUL CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON mension, it is the individual body's experience, known relationally, that remains the central unit of analysis. In her applied phenomenol ogy, for example, Elaine Scarry investigated the experience of pain itself, a primary experience of bodily certainty only derivatively objectified in language to give an aura of reality, and authority, to cultural abstractions (1985: 6, 14, 62). For the more practical task of ethnography, this entails attending to the body and its sensual practices as perceived to precede and exceed, or at least balance, language. For Jackson, "[ijnasmuch as bodily praxis cannot be reduced to a semiotic, bodily practices are always open to interpretation: they are not in themselves interpreta tions of anything" (1983: 339). Perhaps surprisingly, a similar critique arises from the altogether different lineage of cognitive studies: If the anthropologist is often attempting to give an account of "chunked" and non-sentential knowledge in a linguistic medium (writ ing), and she has no alternative, she must be aware that in so doing she is not reproducing the organisation of the knowledge of the people she studies but is transmuting it into an entirely different logical form ... Perhaps we should make much more use of description of the way things look, sound, feel, smell, taste, and so on—drawing on the realm of bodily experience. (Bloch 1998: 15) These scholars remind us that the body as icon of social or cosmological forces should be kept distinct from actual material bod ies themselves, a real body that moves back us again from Foucault to Marx. Ethnographers oriented to phenomenology call for a move towards inhabited bodies; not the study of bodies as representative of discipline or education or class as the object of investigation, but rather bodily sensory experience before it symbolizes or signifies something else. It is the shared subjectivities of the experience of the body that allows for ethnographic understanding. The goal of field work, from this perspective, is not final explanation, then, so much as mutual comprehension between disparate cultures reached through the researcher's co-presence and sensual participation. But how to overcome the division of the senses from the word? Even the discourse of "embodiment" still usually renders the body as a "text" to read and analyze. Queried Lawrence Sullivan: "How will we come to know, in a discursive, conceptual way, the knowledge of the body? Can we know without remainder, in this discursive way, what the body knows?" (Sullivan 1990: 86). One possibility is an increased phenomenological effort towards sharpening the senses in</page><page sequence="12">"the body" 181 such a way that the ethnographer begins to perceive the salient sen sory categories for the persons being described. Another is the use of the senses as key signifying categories, such that, for example, eth nographers pay attention to the way a successful ritual performance entails not only the "right" acts and words, but the "right" smells, tastes, and sounds. Neither of these steps, however, resolves the prob lem of translation, the fact that what is reproduced ethnography is still writing about senses. 1.8. Summary It is clear that invoking "embodiment" by no means always serves the same purpose. Bourdieu's "body" is an epistemological source by which to read the forces of social reproduction, to unmask the mirage of "individual" charisma, talents, and tastes. Bloch's "body" is in service of cognitive memory. Stoller's "body" refers not only to the corporality of those people being studied, but to the senses of the scholar doing the perceiving. Jackson's is the basis for inter-subjective understanding. If we can divide the views into two main camps, the phenomenological and the semiotic, with Marx and Bourdieu's pro ductive and produced body mediating them, one looming question for ethnographers is this: Do we give priority to the lived body in the immediacy and agency of lived experience (insofar as that is possible), or do we aim to record body as it is signified and structured?. In light of this question, I now turn to critically interrogate field work "events"2 from two sites: Rio de Janeiro and the Afro-Brazilian religion called Candomblé, and the religion of the Garifuna as practiced on the Caribbean coast of Honduras. The aim is to inves tigate how abstract conceptions of the body are actually worked out 2 "Events" have been defined by Sahlins (1985) and Sewell (1996). For Sewell, "events" attend to the "lumpiness" of history, moments when the relative coherence and stability of structures are ruptured by dramatic accelerations of transformation. "Events" are temporal points that dramatically transform structure, and which are recognized as such by social actors. For Sahlins, an "event" is more broadly defined as a phenomenal happening attributed with significance. Signified within a structure of interpretation as meaningful, it becomes an "event". Sahlins leaves the question of the import to social actors open. Flere I follow Sahlins' broad characterization since the fieldwork "events" I describe may or may not be attributed with import by actors. They are "events", in brief, for the simple reason that for my own analytical purposes I interpret and present them as such. Quite possibly, the transformative "events" extended no further than in my own structure of interpretation, hence the nomenclature of "fieldwork events".</page><page sequence="13">1 82 PAUL CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON in the practice of fieldwork. Both are ethnographic narratives of reli gion relying upon "embodiment". As will become clear, however, the nomenclature is misleading, since the two approaches encompassed under one tide are utterly distinct. In each case, I present an ex tremely condensed background on the religion being investigated, and then present an ethnographic narrative, itself a thorough second order distillation from "raw" fieldnotes. Finally, for each fieldwork "event" I present a brief interpretation that is deliberately reduced and oversimplified. The strategy is designed to demonstrate the leaps in ethnographic narratives, even those grounded in "the body", from the perceptions of fieldwork notes—themselves highly circumscribed —to structured narratives, and again to theory. The meaning of "the body", once written into ethnography, depends on the theoretical frame to which it is submitted. The danger is that those frames are, in part, contradictory, and must not be confused. 2. Case study I: Brazilian Candomblé and the move from periphery to center" Candomblé is a Brazilian redaction of West African religions recre ated in the radically new context of a nineteenth-century Catholic slave colony. As a new religion, its variations and antecedent tradi tions were divided into "nations'" loose ethnic identities, at first by region of origin in Africa, later modified into distinct, though similar, liturgical forms into which anyone might be initiated. Locales of practice are called terreiros, and are governed by a strict hierarchy of years of initiation, ruled finally by the priest or priestess, the "mother-" or "father-of-saints" {miîe- or pai-de-santo). At its most basic level, Candomblé involves a relation of exchange with a group of superhuman entities called orixás, which mediate between Olorun, a distant high-god, and human beings. They cannot be said to be either natural or supernatural; they work on the boundaries of the natural world. Most often, practitioners define them as "forces of nature", "energies", or as the "African gods". In the worldview of Candomblé, everything and everyone "eats" and must be "fed", especially the orixás. "We feed the earth and the orixás so that they will not eat us", I have heard it said by the priestess with whom I worked. Candomblé involves a set of religious practices that work to preserve life, prosperity, health, and fecundity against forces of death and consumption. This is the first and most</page><page sequence="14">"the body" 183 basic of a whole series of symbolic oppositions between which rituals of Candomblé move: fed/hungry, life/death, house/street, female domain/male domain, secrecy/openness, protected body/vulnerable body, and so on. "Feeding" the orixás yields axé, transformative power to act in the world, pragmatically identified as physical strength, wealth, fecundity, charisma, beauty, success, and luck. For most of its history, Candomblé was a nationally prohibited religion—in fact, not even classed as "religion" at all, but rather regulated under slave law (during Colonial and Monarchic rule until 1889) or as a sickness threatening public health (under the Republic, from 1889 until the middle of the twentieth century). Since 1940, this began to change dramatically as Brazil was reconfigured as the world's first "racial democracy" under populist regimes, gradually incorporating "exotic" into the national repertoire, until by now Candomblé proffers a religious system widely valued in Brazil's national representations presented both to itself and to the world (Johnson 2002). 2.1. The event During 1995, the priestess with whom I had worked intensively was nominated to receive an award, the Pedro Ernesto medal, for civil service in the city of Rio de Janeiro. She had lent her support to various initiatives to combat poverty among Rio's most disenfran chised, and had run for the office of state congresswoman herself. Through her networks of influence, and due also to the city council's desire symbolically to pay homage to the Afro-Brazilian heritage and culture, it was resolved to bestow the medal on her on a weekday evening in the city council chamber at the heart of Rio's municipal plaza. On the appointed evening, the priestess and thirty of her initiates filed into the council chamber. It was filled with high-backed chairs, microphones, and a raised platform—all the external trappings of bureaucratic institutional force. Her initiatic family, like herself, was dressed in the white garb associated with ritual occasions and adorned with the beaded jewelry marking orixá affiliations. We ar rived bearing assorted plants and the three drums used to summon orixás in possession trance during rituals in the terreiro. Several city council members were present to give short speeches and bestow the award, seated along the dais: one wore a wry smile and appeared</page><page sequence="15">1 84 PAUL CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON bemused, the second wrung her hands and seemed concerned that the priestess brought her entire entourage and intended to transform an institutional civic procedure into a ritual performance; a third paid no attention to our arrival at all and pored over his notes. The priestess took her seat in the largest chair on the raised platform. The plants were placed on either side of her, and the drummers signaled to begin their invocations. The song leader (alabe) began a call and response praise-song to the priestess' lineage, singing an homage to Gantois and Mâe Menininha, the house and priestess of her own childhood initiation and apprenticeship. The drums echoed oif the walls and voices were raised in strident chorus, as for a full forty-five minutes the prepared speeches of council-members were delayed as female initiates shuffled in a dance circle. While no orixás in fact "descended" to take over their bodies in trance, the chamber was itself occupied, even possessed by the Afro-Brazilian gods and their devotees. Finally, the priestess signaled the drummers to cease. At this mo ment, the priestess summoned me, the white, foreign researcher, to stand alongside her, with the cry, "Where's my American son?" Once I was posted at her side, standing not sitting, the speeches began, and the medal was given with all due propriety. She beamed, and gave a speech of her own, acknowledging each of her tutelary orixás to share the grand honor with them. For my part, I felt utterly self-conscious and helpless, and looked at the floor wishing the proc ess would end as soon as possible. After an hour and a half the ceremony concluded, and the white-clad devotees of Candomblé departed with their drums, plants, songs, and medal, and the cham ber was returned to its customary nighttime somnolence. 2.2. From narrative to interpretation What was actually said and sung at the ceremony was less important than the sheer material fact of the room's transformation through the presence of ritual clothing, plants, and especially drums. This latter, in fact, effected the radical transformation of the chamber from civic space, governed by strict hierarchic protocol, solemnity, a temporal order run by the clock, Western institutional aesthetic decorum, and relative quiet, to an Afro-Brazilian place characterized by an Afro Brazilian ritual hierarchic order, a disregard for profane time, a spe cifically Candomblé aesthetic ruled by "whiteness" and an abun</page><page sequence="16">"the body" 185 dance of plant greenery and, above all, a heavy reverberation of drums. The drums presented the most dramatic insistence by the priestess that this space be made her place. They rendered any pos sible intervention by city council members, or acceleration of the award-giving procedures, inaudible and impotent. This was particu larly striking since, historically, drums were always identified as a central symbol of the illegal religion, for practitioners and for authori ties. Drums summoned police invasions of terreiros, and drums were the first ritual objects confiscated and destroyed. It was precisely the need for loud drumming that drove most terreiros to the city limits and beyond, seeking a place of refuge from authorities. Police reports often stressed neighbors' complaints and fears about sonically aggres sive rituals. The historical perception of drums casts them into relief as the signifier par excellence of Candomblé identification vis-à-vis other religious traditions of Brazil, and in relation to the nation-state itself. Their role in the peripheralization of Candomblé from the center of Rio and other cities made the priestess' insistence on their presence all the more dramatic at this civic ceremony. It marked, in the most material and sensory mode possible, the arrival of Candomblé at the civic heart of Brazil, and its completed transforma tion from a secret religion to a national and public one. The shift in the ceremony was marked by my bodily summons to the front to stand alongside the priestess. This occurred at precisely the moment when the transfer was being made from Candomblé ritual to civic ceremony. The color of my skin served to mediate between that of most of the Candomblé initiates and that of most council-members. My social capital, submitted to the priestess' au thority, appeared to present a strategy for leveling the ground be tween her and the award-givers. Through her action, I was construed as being, and constructed to be, simultaneously of the Afro-Brazilian religious world and of the institutional world bestowing the medal. Since in my own "lived-world" as ethnographer I remain only mar ginally a part of either one, I felt doubly displaced, and correspond ingly ill-at-ease. 2.3. The body in the interpretation This narrative privileged the agency of the priestess, the senses of the body, and my own situated, observing body. It was the sound of the drums and the aesthetics of the groups' dress, perceived in the con</page><page sequence="17">186 PAUL CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON text of the stately chamber, which was presented as reflecting and constructing a spatial move from periphery to center. Masterfully orchestrated by the priestess, the civil ceremony was appropriated into her own frames of reference by shifting the material and sensory codes of the room. This spatial shift, articulated and demonstrated by transforming the sensory climate of a government room, bestowing on it a ritual rather than a bureaucratic sound and look, was mir rored in my own spatial movement in the room. From the periphery where I was an inconspicuous observer I was summoned to the front, where my status changed discomfittingly from subject to object of the narrative. The religion's move and my move in space were related. As Candomblé has arrived to occupy a central role in the national consciousness, it has done so in part by absorbing and appropriating ethnographers, as well as other artists, intellectuals, and officials, into its own status construction and identity construction. Oversimplify ing, we might say that this narrative relied more or less upon a phenomenological approach to "embodiment"—the body's subjec tive agency, its perceptual sensorium, and the putative co-presence of actors and interpreter. 3. Case study II: "Garifuna religion and the divided community" The Garifuna, formerly called the Black Carib, are descendants both of Africans and of Carib Indians who shared the island of St. Vincent in the Caribbean. The African presence on St. Vincent derived from Carib raids on Puerto Rico, from survivors of slaver shipwrecks near the island, and from the arrival of fleeing maroons from neighboring Barbados. Even as Africans adopted the Indians' religion and lan guage, a combination of Arawak and Carib, their descendants main tained a conscious ethnic difference, and were called Black Carib by Europeans, as distinguished from the "Red Carib". When the British deported the Black Carib in 1797, 5000 were taken from St. Vincent; half arrived on the Honduran coast. On the isle of St. Vincent, Black Carib religion had maintained West African traits, such as possession dances, but also assimilated elements of Island Carib cosmology and ritual, such as the healing techniques of the buyei shaman, who treated sickness by removing "penetrations" and mediated between the needs of ancestral spirits (gubida) and the living bodies whom they possessed and afflicted with sickness. The Garifuna were also influ</page><page sequence="18">"the body" 187 enced by French Catholic missionaries, from whom they adopted techniques for gaining the benevolence of saints. The legacies of all three histories were conjoined when during the nineteenth century their ritual structures and ethnic identity were crystallized as properly "Garifuna". Beginning in the 1980s, however, Protestant evangelical ism began to gain a strong footing, initiating, on one hand, an in crease in Garifuna language literacy through Bible study and, on the other, a vitriolic attack on traditional religious ceremonies denounced as "diabolical". Settling in Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras, most of the men took jobs in the colonial economy, while women tended the home and children and became the main transmitters of religious knowl edge and practice. Men returned regularly, and they were careful to guard and maintain their own land-sites, language, and ritual tradi tions—most notably around crises of death and the curing of gubida inflicted illnesses—and this fidelity has continued to the present, though not without important changes. The strongest sources of challenge to the "tradition" derive from conversions to evangelical ism and the impact of circulating migrants traveling between the Central America coast and the United States, especially New York City. 3.1. The event On October 30, 2000, in the village of Corozal on the Honduran coast, an adolescent girl in a mud house suddenly erupted with an guished screams and howling sounds. Neighbors rushed to investigate the disturbance and, peering in the windows, found the young woman rolling on the floor and knocking brooms over and a pot from a table to the ground. Family members attempted to console her, finally pinning her physically in one place, patting her cheeks and demanding to know what was the matter. A sister tried to get her to drink water. The young woman continued to roll her head wildly from side to side, remaining unresponsive to questions. As curious onlookers gathered, her father closed the shutters. Out the door came her brother, sent to seek out Carlos, the local shaman, even as her grandmother screamed for him to stay put, since this was no place for a shaman to meddle. An audible verbal argument ensued be tween the father and grandmother, the former defending the sha man's skills while the grandmother insisted that this was "devil's</page><page sequence="19">1 88 PAUL CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON work" (cosa de diablo). The grandmother began to pray loudly to Jesus, in the evangelical style, begging him to save her daughter from these evil spirits. The shaman, Carlos, arrived fifteen minutes later, by which time the girl was quiet, though still (as he later reported) prone on the ground in a trance-like catalepsy. Onlookers began to disperse, debating among themselves the na ture of the problem. One young man defended epilepsy as the best reason, while his friend declared that "she lived for the bottle". After Carlos emerged, he explained that this had happened several times before. He had, through divination, consulted his helping spirits [hiyuruha) and learned that the girl's deceased mother demanded a chugu. The chugn is a costly ritual of assembling food and rum, as well as paying specialists like the shaman, drummers, and singers. A chuga might cost anywhere from 5000 to 8000 lempira (S330 to $530), a sum well out of the range of the family's resources. The shaman soothed the afflicting spirit and, making counter-offers, bargained her down to accepting an abundant "mass"—a shorter and cheaper ritual that includes Catholic recitations in addition to food offerings, but without expensive sacrifices or musicians—in return for releasing the girl from the attacks. But even this much the family did not do. This was because the grandmother and the aunt in the household were evangelicals and viewed both the attacks and the proposed ritual remedy as being "of the devil". It was widely circulated, though, that the girl had been heard yelling that she "wanted to visit the cemetery", a sure sign the attacks were from the ancestors. By wiping the girl's head with rum, blowing smoke on her, and using his maracas to soothe and control the attacking spirit, Carlos calmed the girl and returned to his home. This was, he said, only a temporary resolution, and the family would have to make some seri ous choices if she were to live. 3.2. From narrative to interpretation The hinge of the event was the question of spirits. Even a physical "cause" offered by some did not resolve the larger question of why epilepsy or alcohol might wreak such terrible havoc on the girl. That spiritual forces were involved was not in doubt to most: the question is, were the attacking spirits ultimately from Satan, or were they from a deceased relative insisting on better treatment? Each "theological" outcome would call for a concrete, material response. If the answer</page><page sequence="20">"the body" 189 were the former, the solution would be a visit to Nino, the pastor, who would counsel her to attend church that night and come for ward for special prayers and the "laying on of hands". The faithful, in the name of Jesus, would cast out the demons. If the latter, the resolution would be to arrive at an agreement with Carlos the sha man and borrow money from the extended family to assemble the requested chugu, a ritual that would satisfy the deceased mother with food, drink, song, and dance. In a house united under one or the other religious worlds, action could have been taken to alleviate the situation. But in a house divided, half the family members calling themselves católicos (who embrace the "traditional" ritual techniques), half evangélicos (who reject them), no consensus as to legitimate action could be reached. Perhaps no solution was desired. The girl's twisting body provided a platform for each side to press their claims and accuse the other of betrayal. In everyday life, the household functioned normally, cycling through routine activities of food preparation, television watching, gossip, and work. The grandmother and aunt exited nightly for church meetings whose amplified speakers boomed from the other side of the village. The father and eldest son played dominoes and, when there was money for it, drank rum. The underlying tensions only emerged to be articulated and overtly contested on the occasions of the girl's attacks. Caught in the middle of a family torn between two religious systems, her body was the conflict's symptom, sign, and site; the broader religious conflicts were materialized and "embod ied" in her, such that the normally tacit tensions could be articulated. Moreover, this house is representative of many houses in the same village, and the general social tension that emerges around the yearly festivals, or the on the occasion of the largest ritual, a periodic per formance called the diigii. Since it is focused around activities of danc ing and drinking, to summon and fete the spirits, evangélicos proudly avoid any such gatherings. During a diigii, the ideology in which demands that all extended family members participate, the rituals are often said to "fail" and to have lost their power because the evangeli cal family members refuse to be present. The religious war is there fore also a culture war about what being Garifuna should mean. Such abstract questions are condensed, presented and disputed in the tangible form in the sick girl's body.</page><page sequence="21">190 PAUL CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON 3.3. The Body in the Interpretation This narrative relied upon a quite different use of "embodiment". Here I viewed the girl's sick, possessed body as both a symbolic site and metaphor representing a divided community and the issues of power and contestation. The "raw data" of her possessed body and her experience remained inaccessible except as mediated by discur sive constructions of the illness as either gubida ancestor-initiated ill ness, Satanic affliction, alcohol abuse, or epilepsy. There was no body other than a socially produced and constrained one, a body already conformed to one or another schema of interpretation and repertoire of practical action. Though it was mis-recognized by social actors themselves as ancestral or demonic possession, the deeper issue was the socio-religious conflict within the family and the community. Again oversimplifying, this ethnographic narrative relied upon a semiotic approach to "embodiment"—the body as contained, struc tured, and determined within a restricted discursive and practical repertoire. 4. Comparing bodies I could, of course, have done exactly the opposite. 1 could have interpreted the Candomblé priestess' ceremony as an example of structuring constraint by attending to the civic award as a token legitimating gesture, a superficial embrace of Afro-Brazilians that masked their actual marginalized status. Likewise, I could have inter preted the possessed girl's body as a form of agency, a path for gaining momentary power in her household and community (cf. Lewis 1971; Obeyesekere 1981; Boddy 1989; ). "The body", it would appear, remains ethnographically arbitrary until it is embedded in a structure of interpretation, which is to say, in a theory. "The body" never stands free. My motive for comparing "the body" as exercised in the two ethnographic narratives of specific events is to illustrate the need for further specification in the term's use. Though there is, at least in my view, a real physical body itself that exceeds any representation of it, such a body cannot be written. Hence the urgent need for clear declarations and specifications on what purpose "embodiment" serves in a given ethnography. The danger lies in the possibility that the two main approaches—the phenomenological and the semiotic</page><page sequence="22">"the body" 191 —are in an important respect contradictory. There have been so phisticated attempts to synthesize the approaches (e.g., Csordas 1994a; Kapferer 1997; Jackson 1998) such that both are deemed necessary. Csordas, for example, views the semiotic approach as es sential in order to understand how experience becomes intelligible by inhering in a symbolic or semiotic order, and the phenomenological approach as essential in order to understand how experiences such as charismatic healing rituals are efficacious in experience (Csordas 1994a: 81). Still, it remains unclear whether the two perspectives are reconcilable. The key to their reconcilability in a single project seems to rely on the Marx's and Bourdieu's mediating category of the productive and produced body. But even this demands two additional moves: first, an accentuation of Bourdieu's claim that "embodied" practices al ways entail agency and improvisation, however limited within a given gestural repertoire; and second, an extension of phenomenology to include Marx's triangulation of consciousness with production and social life. But such may be a stretch for a phenomenological perspec tive given Marx's priority on production, and his and Bourdieu's insistence on the camera obscura—on mis-recognition as intrinsic to social actors' subjective experiences of meaning (e.g., Marx 1970: 47; Bourdieu 1977: 5, 21-22, 97, 133, 163, 164, 168, 170-183, 191, 195 196)—not to mention the expressed rejection of the "subjectivism" of phenomenology (Bourdieu 1977: 4, 80-81). In fact, for Bourdieu, "embodiment" is not a phenomenological ground for interpretation so much as its rejection, a term allowing the analyst to bracket—to borrow the phenomenologists' term—subjective experiences. To be sure, phenomenological ethnographers like Jackson attempt to juxta pose both, the "lived truth" that allows for the experience of meaning even within structural constraints (1998: 180-181) and the "objective truth" (1998: 24) of their materially, socially and culturally structured condition. It may be possible to integrate both trajectories into a single model. There is, after all, no reason why the structured world and the lived world should of necessity be mutually exclusive, especially if used in Marx's triangulated fashion. If so, we can look forward to further efforts towards complex, sophisticated syntheses. In the meantime, for those of us less synthetically adept, we should not presume that "the body" is one, or athletic enough to leap tall build ings in a single bound. Heavy and sluggish as it is, we should remain</page><page sequence="23">192 PAUL CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON clear which role it is to play in the strategy of our ethnographies, and to what purpose. Finally, even if our objective as ethnographers is no longer "objective truth", then it is still the larger truth gained when one lived world is set by another in an encompassing interpretive frame—the province of theory—however partial and incomplete. Despite all protestations to the contrary, the body's phenomeno logical lived world in ethnography is merely a first step towards thinking about how that lived world works. New terms hold promise, but also risk. As they name what had previously remained implicit, they are inherently unstable, multi-ref erential, and contested. Such is surely the case here. If it once seemed necessary to unite the positions on "the body" to establish their pur chase within ethnography, now that the term is firmly entrenched in our working vocabulary it may be time again to specialize such ter minology and to maintain a clear view into which ancestral lineage one's ethnographic "body" falls.
