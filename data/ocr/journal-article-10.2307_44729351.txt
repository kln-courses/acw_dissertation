ABSTRACT There exist two different methods to investigate the injury mechanisms and the tolerance levels, either sled tests or real road traffic accidents. Sled tests conducted at the University of Heidelberg and real accident cases examined by the University of Hannover were compared. The impact conditions of the Heidelberg sled tests were frontal collisions, with an impact velocity (Av) of 50 km/h and decelerations of 10 g's to 20 g's. Twenty-nine tests with 3-point- belt protected cadavers in the age range 19 to 65 years were included in the Heidelberg collective. The Hannover sample contained 24 frontal accident cases (30 occupants) with a 1 00% overlap of the car front with the same Av and average car deceleration range similar as the sled tests, the passenger compartment was only minimal intruded. Three-point belt protected drivers and front passengers in the age range of 18 to 71 years were included in the sample. The injury pattern and injury severity were found in the cadavers through autopsy, while for the traffic accident sample clinical findings with detailed description of all injuries were stated. In 6 sled tests no rib fractures were observed and in 10 sled tests thorax AIS 2 (2-3 rib fractures, or one sternum fracture) were found. The most fractures were infractions, which means pains in the real accident situation. In 5 cases each one with 9 to 17 rib fractures were observed. The most cases show a spinal AIS 1 and 2, which means, strains and ligamental lacerations. in the real accident sample all the injury degrees of AIS 0 to AIS 6 were found. The most frequent injuries were abrasions and haematomas (AIS 1) but in some cases fractures of the face, rib and extremities were observed. The results show, that real accidents could be compared with sled tests if accident conditions, i.e. severity and impact direction were taken into account. The mechanisms of the injuries in real cases will be discussed with sled test results. INTRODUCTION Some studies were made to compare sled tests with real accident investigations. Patrick et al. (1978) had selected 128 accidents with 169 occupants at a Barrier Equivalent Velocity (BEV) of 2 to 53 mph in the 11 to 1 o'clock direction and has compared these with labor dummy data; Sierra 1050 and Alderson dummies were used in this study. An overall tolerance level for 50 % injury at the AIS 3 level at 45 mph and an upper shoulder harness load 876 daN, a chest Gadd Severity Index of 560 and a peak resultant chest acceleration of 85 g were found. Kallieris et al. (1 982) had compared sled cadaver data by using a Volvo car pulse in the 50 km/h barrier impact; in the cadavers moderate to severe chest injuries have been observed. The injuries observed were more severe than the occupants injuries in the Patrick et al. field survey. A comparison of the Heidelberg cadaver data (Kallieris et al. 1982) with data of the National Crash Severity Study (NCSS) made by Saul et al. 1983 indicates higher injury levels for the cadavers than NCSS accident based data. According to the limited data it was not possible to explain this discrepancy. Data of the National Accident Sampling System (NASS) compared with cadaver sled tests conducted by the University of Virginia (Crandall et al. 1994) are in agreement regarding observed brain and facial injuries if an air bag was used in frontal collisions. 2920</page><page sequence="2">Cesari et al. (1982) has reconstructed two frontal collisions with cadavers and dummies. The authors found a higher level of chest injuries for the cadavers than for the living occupants, however the used cadavers were essentially older than the real accident occupants. The opinion of the authors is that accident investigations and cadaver sled testing have advantages and disadvantages; while sled tests or accident reconstructions with cadavers have the advantage that impact conditions, velocity and deceleration, mechanical responses and kinematics are well known, on the other hand the reaction and the missing of the organ turgor may have an influence to the injury severity up to a certain impact severity. Real accidents have the advantages of existing reaction, muscle tone and blood pressure, a disadvantage is to exactly define the right impact conditions, the unknown mechanical responses and the kinematics. The sled tests with cadavers and the real accident investigations complement one another. In order to compare cadaver sled tests with real accidents two collectives with defined selection criteria were chosen. BACKGROUND SLED TESTS, UNIVERSITY OF HEIDELBERG - The tests have been performed on a deceleration sled at the Institute of Legal Medicine of the University of Heidelberg. In one part of the tests the pulse was similar to the pulse of a mid-sized car impacting a fixed barrier in 50 km/h, in the most cases the pulse was of trapezoidal shape. A mean deceleration was calculated through the measured velocity and the breaking distance (deformation of a flat steel). In some tests only the seat and the three- point belt were mounted to the sled, while in the most tests, the front part of a mid-sized car was mounted onto the sled. Belted and instrumented cadavers were used for the tests. The most important information for the sled tests: 29 sled tests in driver position Age of the cadaver: 1 9 - 65 years A v: 47 - 56 km/h mean decel.: 10 - 20 g Restraint: 3-point standard belt Sled weight: 600 -J 1 00 kg Impact angle: 1 80° The age distribution of the cadaver and the distribution of the deceleration are shown in figure 1 and 2. ACCIDENT DATA, UNIVERSITY OF HANNOVER - Corresponding to the impact conditions of the sled tests, accident cases were selected of the Hannover accident unit. The collective included 24 accidents with belted drivers and 6 front passengers (all together 30 occupants) with the following specifications. Age of the occupant: 1 8 - 71 years A v: 45 - 55 km/h mean decel.: 10 - 34 g Restraint: 3-point standard belt Car weight: 750 - 1 750 kg Impact angle: 180° ± 30° The accidents were documented for the years 1985 to 1991. The accident documentation was carried out using a statistical spot - check plan (Otte 1994). The accidents documented by the team are compared with the total registrations of accidents by the police in the same region, mirrors in the data structure could be balanced by statistical evaluations. These cases are a random sample and can, therefore, be valuated as representative. Within the framework of accident analysis the collision speed as well as the movement behavior of the vehicles were reconstructed. The speed alteration due to A v of the collisions derived from the mathematical - physical impact analysis on the basis of traces and deformation patterns. In accident analysis the deceleration could not be measured, that could be evaluated only as mean deceleration determined out of the depth of the deformation and the calculated A v. Av2 a = 2 def Normally, the deformation depth is often a parameter with different tolerance, so the calculated mean deceleration in accident studies are not comparable with the sled test situation. For that A v is much more qualified for distinction. The impact severity of the car was determined of the vehicles front when compared to the barrier impact; photographs were taken to permit a visual evaluation of the damage. The age distribution of the occupants and the distribution of the decelerations are shown in figure 1 and 2. 2921</page><page sequence="3">Figure 1 : Age distribution of occupants and cadavers investigated Figure 2: Deceleration distribution of occupants and cadavers investigated ACCIDENT DATA, HEIDELBERG AREA - A second data accident sample with 14 frontal collisions with following specifications was quite in our disposal Age of the occupant: 21-81 years A v: 45 - 55 km/h mean decel.: 14 - 24 g Restraint: 3-point standard belt Car weight: 860 - 1400 kg The impact severity was defined in the same manner as the Hannover sample. MEDICAL FINDINGS SLED TESTS - The injuries were observed according to the autopsy and a detailed investigation of the vertebral column. The injury severity was scaled in accordance to AIS 90. ACCIDENT DATA SAMPLES - The injury pattern and injury severity of the Hannover sample were obtained from the hospital records, the physicians and the patients; they include a detailed description of all injuries which were stated. The injury severity was scaled in accordance to AIS 90. For the second accident sample, Heidelberg area, only a global description of the occupants injured body parts were available. Therefore a direct comparison of the injury severity between the sled tests and this collective is not possible. A global description of the injuries according the body parts will be separately made. RESULTS SITUATION OF SLED TESTS AND CAR ACCIDENTS - Figure 3 and 4 show two examples of the situation of the sled test buck after the impact and a car after the frontal accident. Intrusions were not possible in the sled tests in comparison to the car accident. The impact energy of the sled was absorbed by deformation of a flat steel. Figure 3: Sled test, post test situation. Measured Av: 48 km/h, stopping distance: 65 cm, medium sled deceleration: 14g. Driver: female, 52 years old, body weight: 68 kg, body length: 168 cm, belted with 3-point belt. Injuries: Fracture of the sternum at the level of the 3rd to 4th intercostal space, fracture of the 2nd rib left at the front axillar line - seat belt. Laceration of the ligamentum flavum, Th1/Th2 - frontal flexion of the head - seat belt (MAIS 2). 2922</page><page sequence="4">Figure 4: Real accident- frontal collision. Estimated Av: 55 km/h, deformation depth: 84 cm, estimated deceleration: 14 g. Driver: male, 40 years old, body weight: 88 kg, body length: 178 cm, belted with 3- point belt. Injuries: Contusion at the neck left-seat belt, fracture of the 5th to 7th rib right-steering wheel (MAIS 2). Intrusion: steering column, footwell. MEDICAL FINDINGS SLED TESTS - Superficial injuries (abrasions) on the shoulder and hip were observed, sometimes facial and extremity injuries were found. During the rebound phase occasionally occured an occipital impact against the B-pillar with lacerated wounds of the scalp or skull fractures and brain contusions. The detailed investigation of the vertebral column shows soft tissue injuries, i.e.. strains or lacerations of muscles and ligaments, intervertebral discs, joints and interspinal space, whereas compression fractures of vertebral bodies were seldom found. The injuries of the vertebral column included the cervical spine and the cervico-thoracic transition. The most frequent injuries observed were rib and sternal fractures. At 6 of the 29 investigated cases the thorax skeleton remained uninjured. Three cases showed only sternal fractures, while in 1 9 cases 2 to 17 rib fractures were observed, in 9 cases additionally also sternal fractures were found. The most frequent type of rib and sternal fractures were incomplete fractures at the front of the chest. X-ray radiographs with a conventional device in anterior- posterior direction were not suitable to detect this type of fractures, also by radiologists. The only possibility to detect this type of fracture was the x- ray radiographs of the isolated chest front by a special x-ray device (for material investigation) or the pulpation of the ribs during the autopsy. Only in 2 cases abdominal injuries (liver ruptures) were observed. Sternal fractures and liver ruptures were caused through the local compression of the shoulder belt, while rib fractures were also located additionally outside of the belt path. ACCIDENT DATA - The injuries of front car passengers included more body parts in comparison to the cadaver sled tests. Also in this collective, soft tissue and bony injuries of the thorax were observed. Contusions and abrasions of the face, shoulder, chest and extremities were found, furthermore lacerations of the face and the upper extremities. Skull - brain injuries and distortions of the cervical spine were also observed in some cases. The thoracic skeleton injuries included clavicle, sternal and single to series of rib fractures; additionally, compression and torsion fractures of the upper and lower extremities were observed, in some cases also ligamental ruptures and distortions of the ankle joint were found. In real accidents 58% of the occupants suffered head injuries, 70% thorax, 50% arm and 53% leg injuries. With 23% the neck is an often observed injury region (Figure 5).

Soft part injuries, which include contusions, abrasions and lacerated contused wounds for the real accident sample and only abrasions for the sled tests, are clearly higher in the real accident collective. On the other hand the cadaver tests show a fracture frequency twice as high as for the accident cases. Similar observations were made when two age 2923</page><page sequence="5">groups 'up to 45 years' and older than 45 years' were compared. In the age group older 'than 45 years' 9 cadaver sled tests are included. The mean sled deceleration is generally lower than in the age group 'up to 45 years' which could explain that no cases with fractures and organ injuries were observed. An illustration of the absolute frequency of the cases with rib and sternum fractures for both samples is shown in figure 6; the differences are evident, more cases with rib fractures were observed in the cadavers. Additionally to the rib fractures in eleven cases contusions at the rib area were observed in the real accident sample, furthermore a contusion at the sternum. In one case a clavicle fracture was found.

In agreement is MAIS 2, which means for cadaver testing sternal fractures, 2 - 3 rib fractures or ligamental lacerations of the cervical spine, for the real accident sample MAIS 2 means commotio, skull, cervical vertebral body or extremities fractures. Clear differences exist for MAIS 1; these type of injuries, like contusions, lacerated contused wounds, incised wounds and abrasions, are underrepresented for the cadavers. The cadavers show more cases with MAIS 3 and MAIS 4, e.g. 5 to 17 rib fractures; the highest injury severity of the cadavers was MAIS 4 (flail chest), while in the real accident sample two cases occurred with MAIS 5 and MAIS 6 for brain injuries, but in these cases the accident condition with a more upper deformation of the bonnet and windscreen region implied the injuries of the head. The injury severity of the body parts is listed in table 2. A clearly high frequency of the observed head and leg injuries of the real accident sample is evident in comparison to the cadaver tests. Furthermore the AIS 2 neck injuries were only found in the cadavers. 2924</page><page sequence="6">Figure 7: MAIS distribution for the sled test and the real accident collective Table 2: Injury severity of the different body parts (real accidents / sled tests) AIS 1 AIS 2 AIS 3 AIS 4 AIS 5 AIS 6 head 10/0 6/1 --/1 --/1 1/0 1/0 neck 6/8 --/12 1/1 --/-- --/-- --/-- thorax 11/1 6/10 4/7 --/6 --/-- --/-- arms 13/0 2/0 --/-- --/-- --/-- --/-- abdomen 2/0 - / - - / 1 - / 1 - / - - / - pelvis 2/0 - / - - / - - / - - / - -- / -- legs 9/2 - / - 4/0 1/0 - / - - / - ACCIDENT DATA, HEIDELBERG AREA - The injuries of the body parts of the 14 accident cases included soft tissue injuries (78%), skull-brain injuries (50%), rib fractures (43%), upper and lower extremity fractures (21%). Only in one case a liver and spleen rupture with bleeding to death was observed (Av: 55 km/h, deceleration: 23g, male, 66 years, body weight: 1 1 0 kg). DISCUSSION The study compares 29 sled tests with belted cadavers and 24 accident cases with 30 belted front passengers at the configuration of the frontal collision. While the Av of the sled tests was measured, the Av of the real accidents was estimated from the mathematical-physical impact analysis on the basis of traces and deformation pattern. Photographs of the damaged car (small and middle class cars) of each case were available. While the injuries of the cadavers were found through the autopsy for the accident cases short records containing the injuries were available by hospitals, physicians and reports of patients with possible impact parts of the car. The type and location of injuries observed between the collectives investigated were clearly 2925</page><page sequence="7">different. A higher frequency for head, arm and legs was observed in the real accident sample. The head injuries included skin injuries, skull fractures and brain injuries with an AIS 1 to AIS 6 and were caused through impact against the steering wheel, A-pillar, splinter of glass, windscreen, windscreen- wiper and dashboard. In 6 cases with AIS 2, which means skull fracture and in 2 cases, each AIS 5 and AIS 6, brain injuries were found as a result of a high energetic head impact against inner car front structures. On one hand, a high energetic impact is the result when the 3-point belt with slack was used, on the other hand, if an intrusion of the car front structures occurred. The head of the driver ( male, 24 years, body weight 95 kg, size 175 cm) and front passenger ( male, 27 years, body weight and size unknown) experienced brain injuries of AIS 5 and AIS 6 in a car Toyota Carina; the Av amounted 50 km/h at an impact angle of 160°, the plastic deformation of the car front was 77 cm. A high energetic head impact against the dashboard will be assumed. The most arm injuries were skin injuries of AIS 1 , fractures of the radius were rarely observed as result of reinforcement against the steering wheel during the collision phase. Leg injuries are caused through knee impact against a dashboard (patella, femur) and are a result of the high belt slack. Compression fractures of tibia and fibula or injuries of the foot and ankle joint were caused through reinforce and /or intrusion of the foot room. These injury type is not expected in cadaver sled testing. Patrick et al. (1974) found the same type of head, arm and leg injuries, however the impact severity was lower in most cases and therefore they observed lower injury severities. The following table shows frequencies of damages of the restraint system and of internal front car structures due to mutual effects with a body part by the Hannover collective. Table 3:Frequencies of damages of the real world accident situation friction damage of seat belt: 51 ,6 % dashboard impact of knee: 35,5 % dislocation of steering wheel: 54,8 % footwell intrusion: 77,4 % dashboard intrusion: 38,7 % In the cadaver sample the thoracic injuries were over-represented caused through rib and sternal fractures; furthermore the AIS 2 severity of neck injuries, usually ligament lacerations, is only found through the detailed investigation of the vertebral column. This observation leads to the conclusion that the energy is absorbed over the trunk causing rib and sternal fractures. The cadaver is belted without slack, like the use of a pretensioner, a high energetic head impact against a steering wheel is not possible because of the less head displacement, however, a high head bending angle with more frequent cervical spine injuries of AIS 2 occurred than in the accident sample. The number of rib fractures in cadavers at sled testing depends on the one hand from the age, on the other from the impact severity. This is in accordance with the few cases of rib fractures in the real accident sample; passengers aged 60 to 70 years received serious rib fractures, however, according to the reconstruction they are not caused by the belt, but through the impact against the steering wheel; this is also a result of the high belt slack or/and intrusion. The location of rib and sterpai fractures observed in cadavers were comparable with those of passengers reported by Patrick et al. (1974) in real accidents restrained by retractor and non-retractor 3-point belts, while the location of sternal and rib fractures was not present in the Hannover sample. In the most cadaver tests, the observed rib fractures were no complete fractures, but infractions; possibly caused rib infractions at the chest front underneath the belt path, which the physicians diagnosed as contusions. In the real accident sample 1 1 cases with contusions in the rib area were observed, it is not excluded that in this cases rib infractions were caused. As a comparison of the 2 investigated collectives according to the kind and severity of injury the velocity change (Av) was used as a base. The real accident sample contained small and middle-sized cars with different deformation characteristics of the car front and therefore different pulses to each other and to the sled testing. Furthermore, the seating position and the belt use is in the real accident sample not standardized in each case, during the sled testing the impact is reproducible. In real accident cases usually a secondary rotation of the car after the crash is observed; those relative movements of the front passengers result in the possibility of an impact of body parts against internal frontal structures of the car with corresponding injuries. The kind, the severity and position of the observed injuries in real accidents led to the conclusion that the 3-point belt is normally worn with a high slack, therefore pretensioners are only essential to avoid high head displacements. Table 4 summarizes the parameters influence, the injury pattern and injury severity of the real accidents and cadaver tests. 2926</page><page sequence="8">The study has shown that accident data and the sled tests with cadavers follow up different aims. While the real accident cases informs about the injury risk of human body parts, the sled tests with instrumented cadavers are the only method to determine the correlation between mechanical response and injury severity under standardized impact conditions for the definition of occupant protection criteria. For a direct comparison of accident data with cadaver testing, reconstructions of identical impact situations with the same cars, occupied with cadavers are needed. Seating position and anthropometry of the real accident and the reconstruction have to be comparable. Table 4: Parameters, that influence the injury pattern and severity between real accidents and cadaver tests real accident cases conditions cadaver tests different vehicle model same high tolerances accident conditions(v, g, Av, impulse) small tolerances possible intrusion no intrusion existing rotation of vehicle during collision movement not existing deceleration (brake) impact following acceleration different seat belt geometries same possible slack of belt system none even distribution age of occupants even distribution different seating position same At the second accident collective investigated (Heidelberg area) also head, rib and extremity fractures were observed. The frequency of the skull- brain injuries as well as the frequency of the cases with rib fractures was higher than the Hannover sample; on the other hand, the frequency of the cases with rib fractures was in agreement to that observed in cadaver tests. CONCLUSIONS Traffic accident analyses and sled testing with instrumented cadavers follow up different aims. Traffic accident data supply information about the injury risk by correct use/ misuse of restraint systems. Further influence factors to the injury risk are the deformation characteristics of the car front, the impact angle, the sitting position e.t.c.. Sled cadaver testing contributes to investigate the injury pattern and to determine correlations between mechanical responses and injury severity to define occupant protection criteria under well documented controlled laboratory crash conditions.
