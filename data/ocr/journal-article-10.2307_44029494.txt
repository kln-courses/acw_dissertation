This essay analyzes the Empire State Corporation's textual and visual propaganda, much of which was displaced onto Kong, concluding that both giant ape and skyscraper were dual ciphers of the Depression era's heroic and exploited multiethnic construction workers.

Before arriving at its crest, a long shot shows him scaling its flank as a tiny speck, foreshadow- ing his ultimate demise (Illus. 1). His arrival at the summit with blonde Ann Dar row (Fay Wray) in his grasp announces his temporary mastery of the mammoth structure and ocular possession of the entire city. This is corroborated by a preliminary script: "Holding the girl aloft in one hand, he beats his giant breast with the other. He, Kong of the World Before Man, defies the mightiest city ever erected by the hand of man" (Cooper, Wallace, and Creelman 4). In spite of his fleeting triumph and virile pres- ence, Kong's transgressive love is never consummated (Illus. 2). After placing Ann on an adjacent ledge, Kong is shot by men in fighter planes, causing him to plummet helplessly to his death.

These incidents are among the most memorable, not simply because of the dramatic star power of Kong, but because of his contest and identification with the Empire State Building, which also suffered a fall from grace during the Depression. While diverse scholars have long acknowledged the iconic skyscraper's significance to the film, there has been no sustained effort to interpret Kong specifically in the context of its physical properties or the publicity created for it, nor to explain the fusion of ape and sky- scraper in light of changing views on lofty architecture and construction work from the Machine Age to the darker days of Depression (Gottesman and Geduld; Mayne). The film's story commenced at a time when the viability of the ever-larger skyscrapers that had multiplied in the nation s urban centres was a hotly contested topic, and was</page><page sequence="3">Merrill Schleier 31 2. Kong atop the Empire State Building. Frame enlargement from King Kong, Dirs. Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B.

An anony- mous writer in the New Republic summed up the dominant sentiments during the eco- nomic debacle, while underscoring the implied spatial dynamics in the last scene of King Kong, referring to skyscrapers as "the material embodiment of the late bull market," which "soar boldly above a mesa of roofs, very much as the spire-graph of 1929 equity prices," but now serve as "ironic witnesses of collapsed hopes" ("Bull" 192). Other Depression-era films such as Skyscraper Souls (1932), Baby Face (1933), and Counsellor-at-Law (1934) also render skyscrapers in problematic terms, as sites of charged eroticism and class tension, where rapacious businessmen prey on their sub- ordinates with gusto, and where suicide and murder lurk, occasioned by financial ruin</page><page sequence="4">32 Mosaic 41/2 (June 2008) 3. The Dwight Building and the Empire State Building. Frame enlargement from Skyscraper Souls, Dir. Edgar Selwyn, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, 1932. and betrayal. For example, the establishing shot of Skyscraper Souls consists of a long shot of the tombstone-like Dwight Building and a dwarfed Empire State Building, a dystopian scene of a skyscraper city that served as a reversal of the urban sublime (Illus. 3). Surveying the dual pinnacles from above at the outset of Skyscraper Souls fore- shadowed the "skyscraper suicide" of a professional "fallen woman" who, like Kong, plunges to her death. The appearance of these two lofty edifices underscores the degree to which the film was informed by changing views of the Empire State Building and the debates swirling around speculative, seemingly limitless skyscrapers, here used as a way to warn of the perils of constant upward striving. This view is echoed in Baby Face , in which Lily Powers (Bette Davis) sleeps her way to the top, seen literally in the</page><page sequence="5">Merrill Schleier 33 panning of a Manhattan office building's exterior, only to lose it all before returning to her working-class roots in Erie, Pennsylvania, where she seeks her redemption. These films were made largely for the Depression's disenfranchised audience, mem- bers of which were encouraged to renounce greedy capitalists and materialism in favour of an adherence to their class affiliations and traditional gender positions, as a way to restore stability and normative values. The scholarship on Kong is voluminous. He has been variously interpreted as a nightmarish monster, an image of coded blackness, an exotic other, libidinal energy gone awry, and a symbol of Depression-era anger. As Roger Dadoun points out, Kong is evocative because of his suggestive emptiness, or his capacity to be both a purveyor and producer of so many different identities (107). In order to more fully understand Kong, film historian Cynthia Erb suggests in a recent study an interdisciplinary move- ment outside of Film Studies (22). In response to Erb's appeal, I seek to unpack the manner in which aspects of the Empire State Building's mythic and material properties, including its commanding size, and the Empire State Corporation's publicity campaign, including commemorative books and pamphlets, public events and spectacles, and Lewis Hine's commissioned photographs of construction workers, are displaced onto the giant ape in the film's final scenes. This previously unanalyzed extra-architectural discourse surrounding the Empire State Building will shed new light on the manner in which its ersatz manliness is transferred to Kong as he tries to dominate the city. One must also view Kong's literal and figurative ascension and fall in the context of ideolo- gies concerning masculine success epitomized by the "human flies" who climbed sky- scrapers for fame and fortune during the post- World War I building boom and the multiethnic construction workers who fabricated them, but who subsequently lost their livelihoods and sense of manly purpose during the Depression. My decision to categorize Kong in dialectic terms as both antagonist and ana- logue to the Empire State Building is prompted, in part, by Judith Mayne's pioneer- ing article, in which she identifies the film's structural symmetries (Skull Island and Manhattan), its asymmetrical thematic approach (e.g. savagery versus civilization), while acknowledging the shared "otherness" of the giant ape and New York. Extending Mayne's methodology, I argue that Kong's fusion and duel with skyscrapers, and the Empire State Building specifically, are overdetermined, and the rhetoric surrounding them are an integral part of his identity. Indebted to the work of Jacques Derrida, I evaluate Kong through the lens of the Empire State Building rather than basing his identity solely on the aims of those who "constructed" him. For example, in the film's final sequences, issues of victory and defeat are enacted in the relay of shots that pic- ture a small ascending Kong, a triumphant giant, followed by a plummeting speck,</page><page sequence="6">4. Lewis Hine, Another Connecter Goes Aloft. Published in Men at Work. New York: Macmillan Co., 1932, n.p.</page><page sequence="7">Merrill Schleier 35 which are redolent with ideologies concerning manly work, the effects of "sky- scraperization," and the misfortunes occasioned by the Great Depression. A crucial aspect of the Corporation's parable was the valorization of construc- tion workers' seminal energies, which were supposedly absorbed into the body of the Empire State Building, and later Kong, forging an architectural image of both primeval and rational masculinity. This strategy was offered, in part, as a ploy to pro- mote a positive vision of instrumental, manly labour at a time when so many citizens had lost their jobs and the nation suffered from increased labour strife. Historian Barbara Melosh has pointed to the valorization of manly, working-class labourers in the New Deal murals produced several years after Hine's chronicle of the Empire State Building's workers. She claims that the heroic paintings, which feature Herculean men performing cooperative, manual tasks, were employed as visual propaganda meant to communicate that through these labourers' efforts, both individually and en masse , the nation could be rebuilt and its morale restored. They are similar to Hine's photo- graphs of larger-than-life construction workers, in which he celebrated the melding of human initiative and technological modernity (Illus. 4). The Kong film's to the director star power and co-writer, of skyscrapers Merian prior C. Cooper, to the originated erection of the the idea Empire of yoking State Kong to the star power of skyscrapers prior to the erection of the Empire State Building. In a press release from 1933, Cooper explained that he had been mulling over the story of a giant beast who, because of his intelligence, prefigured man, when a thought occurred to him: "What would happen to this highest representative of prehis- toric animal life in our materialistic, mechanistic civilization? Why not place him at the pinnacle of the tallest building, symbol in steel, stone and aspiration, and pit him against modern man?" (qtd. in Goldner and Turner 38). In another account of the film's genesis, Cooper recalled that he was leaving his office in Manhattan in February of 1930 when he heard the sound of an airplane motor, causing him to instinctively look upward. He saw a plane flying adjacent to what he thought was the highest skyscraper of the time, Cass Gilbert's gold-tipped New York Life Insurance Building (1928). Cooper claimed: "I immediately saw in my mind's eye a giant gorilla on top of the build- ing, and I thought to myself, 'If I can get that gorilla logically on top of the mightiest building in the world and then have him shot down by the most modern of weapons, the airplane, then no matter how giant he was in size, and how fierce, that gorilla was doomed by civilization.'" After visualizing this image, he realized that he had both the film's final scene and its "chariot race," or dramatic, defining moment (qtd. in Haver 77). Soon thereafter, Cooper transferred this essential episode to the Empire State Building. In an undated memo written before February of 1932 to Edgar Wallace, the</page><page sequence="8">36 Mosaic 41/2 (June 2008) first of several screenwriters, he wrote: "Please see if you consider it practical to work out theme that John [Ann's love interest] attempts single handed rescue on top of the Empire State Building if police will let off shooting for a minute. Then he falls, airplane attack or something like that" (qtd. in Erb 44). Cooper's initial title for the film was the "Eighth Wonder," the same appellation given to Empire State Building, which further attests to the growing importance it had in Cooper's conceptualization of Kong's story. Cooper was responding, no doubt, to the most popular conflation of Kong and the Empire State Building - their monumental proportions - which contemporary observers likened to a national trait. The Nation's William Troy dubbed Kong "a verita- ble skyscraper among apes," in 1931, attributing their twin grandiosity to an American preference for overstatement (326). Similar language was applied to the Empire State Building shortly after its completion. A commentator for the World Telegram inquired rhetorically: "Why was this stupendous structure built: was it built to glorify men, to glorify human passion for bigness? Or is it but an inevitable expression of the new age of gigantism?" (qtd. in James 44). Kong had conquered his former domain, Skull Island, by his sheer girth and strength, while the Empire State Building had outdis- tanced all other skyscrapers in both scale and magnitude, referred to as the "Everest on Fifth Avenue" (New York Times). More relevant to Kong, men's bodies were likened to the Empire State Building, such as that of wrestling champion Leo Pinetzki, who was described as "the world's mountain-weight wrestling champion," with an "Empire State Building physique - 283 pounds, six feet nine inches tall, with a 96-inch reach" (Tauranac 22). As a Manhattan resident, Cooper had also witnessed the effects of the post- World War I building boom, which resulted in new super skyscrapers that began to compete with one another in height and girth, prompting debates concerning their gigantism and viability. Newspapers stoked the competition: would the Chrysler or the Empire State be taller, or would the Bank of New York Building really reach 1600? they inquired (Stern, Gilmanton, and Mellins 603). On one side of the dispute were architects such as Harvey Wiley Corbett and Hugh Ferriss who envisioned fictional "paper spires," ever-larger, multipurpose skyscrapers that would serve as antidotes to urban congestion, pollution, and the lack of greenery, light, and air. These ideas were popularized visually by Ferri ss in his architectural renderings, which, beginning in 1921, were published widely, and exhibited in major shows such as the Titan City Exhibition in 1925 and the Machine Age Exposition in 1927. These dramatic images, rendered in velvety black and white, forged a new urban sublime in which dwarfed humans stand in awe before theatrically-illuminated megastructures. In his popular book, The Metropolis of Tomorrowy which summed up his ideas of almost a decade,</page><page sequence="9">Herrill Schleier 37 Ferriss rhapsodized about the skyscraper's potential, while intuiting its ability to wreak havoc, perhaps anticipating the last scene of King Kong : "There is a moment of curiosity even for those who have seen the play before, since in all probability they are about to view some newly arisen steel skeleton, some tower or some street which was not in yesterday s performance. And to one who had not been in the audience before - some visitor of another land or another age - there could not fail to be at least one moment of wonder. What apocalypse is about to be revealed?" (Ferriss 15). Art and architectural commentator Lewis Mumford served as the major detractor of skyscraper cities throughout the twenties and beyond. His articles sported such aggressive titles as "Is the Skyscraper Tolerable?" "Botched Cities," and "The Intolerable City." According to Mumford, a skyscraper existence was crushing; city dwellers laboured in mechanized cubicles, rode in confining subways before returning home to equally stul- tifying quarters, rendering them virtual automatons ("Intolerable" 283-93). Mumford articulated these views at the moment that Cooper was looking for the film's "chariot race" and seems to have influenced his idea that the Empire State Building was repre- sentative of our "materialistic, mechanistic civilization" (qtd. in Goldner and Turner 38) Cooper's their antagonism decision to or place by the Kong sound at the of skyscraper's an airplane, crest but was also not by the only appearance prompted by of their antagonism or by the sound of an airplane, but also by the appearance of numerous construction workers during the building boom, high atop steel scaffolds, who were lauded in the popular press for their courage, athletic skill, and masculine prowess, creating a virtual entertainment spectacle. As a journalist reported in 1931, "A skyscraper under construction is one of the most thrilling sights in the modern city. [. . .] Perhaps you caught sight of the men who worked in and about the naked steel [...]. To begin with, he is a workman with the poise of an acrobat, the skill of a juggler, the strength of a blacksmith, and the team-work of a ball-player" (Davis 194). Here, the displacement of primeval masculinity onto the building is accomplished metonymically by referring to the steel as "naked," while commenting on the strength of both. The theatrics of urban construction was likewise noted by a New York Times columnist who marvelled, "Down in the street the crowd gapes up [. . .]. High up in the red and black steel frame of a rising skyscraper the riveters are putting on the best open-air show in town" (Poole 8). Lewis Hine was hired by the Empire State Corporation to chronicle these daring workers, rendering them as potent and manly, in full control of their muscular bod- ies, which echoed visually a contemporary journalist's description of "brawny men whose hands are rough and gnarled, whose shoulders are leather and muscle" (Littell 46; see Illus. 4). Often photographed from a low vantage point, Hine fashioned images</page><page sequence="10">5. Lewis Hine, Finishing up the Job. Published in Men at Work. New York: Macmillan Co., 1932, n.p.</page><page sequence="11">Merrill Schleier 39 of seemingly monumental humans wielding powerful, steely tools (Illus. 5). Thus, Cooper's melding of Kong and the tall building with both urban spectacle and primeval masculinity was already an inextricable part of skyscraper discourse, con- tinued in the verbal and visual propaganda surrounding the Empire State Building. Many of Hine's photographs pay homage to the heterogeneous workforce that fabricated skyscrapers, infusing the giant ape with traces of working-class immigrant labour. As contractor Alfred Bossom noted in Building to the Skies , the skyscraper builders spoke "every language under the sun except English." Observing tall building construction gave "one a marvelous chance of appreciating at close range what is meant when America is spoken of as a melting pot. The tower of Babel was nothing to it." On one of his own building sites, he observed at least ten different nationalities, including Italians, Irishmen, Frenchmen and "Red Indians" (119). The Mohawks were particularly known for their contributions to bridge and sky- scraper building since their immigration from Canada to New York in the 1880s. During New York's building boom of the 1920s, many Mohawks settled in the North Gowanus neighbourhood of Brooklyn, and participated in the erection of such sky- scrapers as the Chanin Building (1929), the Bank of Manhattan Building (1929), the RCA Building (1931), and most importantly, the Empire State Building. Mohawk sky- scraper builders were viewed as exemplars of primeval masculinity and often described in essentialist, almost bestial terms as peripatetic in nature, with adventure in their blood. When a steel construction job became available, they supposedly communi- cated with each other telepathically, and appeared "wild in the eyes" (Mitchell 21). They were hired because of their so-called intrepid spirits and absolute fearlessness of height; it was reported that they often climbed to the highest point of an emergent building if left unsupervised. Like Kong, who takes off to find his miniature blonde love interest, daringly scaling various skyscrapers in New York before reaching the Empire State Building's summit, the Mohawks were reportedly prompted by inex- orable forces. Hence, Kongs hybrid nature, ascension of the skyscraper, and status as colonized other may have been infused with actual and mythologized depictions of skyscraper workers, notably the Mohawks. The amusement and thrill provided by skyscraper construction workers and steeplejacks atop lofty pinnacles originated after World War I in the development of a new type of urban sport. Working-class labourers scaled skyscrapers, transforming their climbing skills and counter-phobic responses to height for more lucrative rewards. They were nicknamed "human flies" or "spiders" due to the discrepancy in scale between them and the lofty buildings they sought to surmount. Previous scholars such as Morris have explained Kong's climb to the Empire State Building's pinnacle as a representative</page><page sequence="12">40 Mosaic 41/? (June 2008 ) of his desire to recreate the mountainous proportions of his previous domain Skull Island, while Erb has credited Kong for his ability to prompt successive climbers to scale tall buildings. Yet, Kong was not the initiator of these athletic, urban theatrics; his skyscraper scaling was prompted, in part, by the multitude of real human flies who began climbing tall buildings in the 1910s and 1920s for fame and profit. In 1918, a reporter for the Literary Digest attested to the widespread popularity of the pastime: "Atlanta has the climbing fever. Small boys are wearing out their parents, soda foun- tain clerks are discussing the fad with fair and ambitious customers, argumentative citizens are debating the merits of the toe-and-finger grips, while the local labor- union is considering whether or not to admit the 'human spider' into the organiza- tion" (60). Contemporary journalists who covered the exploits of these daring actors articulated prevailing views on a self-fabricated masculinity while exploring the class issues inherent in such dangerous activities. Enacting, even altering, one's masculin- ity in a physical, competitive manner through bodily exertion was prompted, in part, by the athletic craze that swept the nation beginning in the 1870s. Perhaps the most famous performer was Theodore Roosevelt, who began as a bespectacled, debilitated youth, and later advocated the "strenuous life," which included hiking, horseback rid- ing, and mountain climbing (similar to skyscraper scaling in its quest for the ineffa- ble) as a revitalizing agent for the neurasthenic, "feminized" male, believed to be weakened by the vicissitudes of urban life. Prevailing hegemonic notions of mas- culinity thus required men to amplify themselves physically and become more active in an outdoor arena. Hence, these working-class "cowboys of the skies" employed their well-developed bodily attributes and prowess in the service of a new, performa- tive manhood already in place (Poole 641). Early on, Kong was conceptualized as a "giant ape-man" and was fabricated to specifically include the musculature of a pugilist and the gestures of a man by special effects expert Willis O'Brien (RKO n.p.; Dunn). The latter began his career as a sports cartoonist, and had an abiding interest in boxing, which, like skyscraper scaling, was a way for working-class men to gain dis- tinction through physical exertion. A typical article, titled "Adventures of a Steeplejack," chronicled the feats of one such construction worker-turned-fly, Alfred Dow, a veteran who had been climbing since the days of the Spanish American War. Dow and his confederates were depicted as paragons of masculinity, fearless urban pioneers or soldiers, who had miraculously survived flashes of lightening, cannon balls, high winds, and even nervous strain, but who had triumphed. In terms that conjure up manly conquest and Manifest Destiny, Dow was described as having the same "calm, penetrating eyes" found in "seafaring men and North Country trappers" (Crowell 30). Most of those interviewed described</page><page sequence="13">Merrill Schleier 41 their profession as liberating, which ensured them a type of freedom that was unavail- able to most city dwellers. Seemingly oblivious to the risks inherent in his profession, Dow claimed that he felt "sorry for the folks scurrying around like beetles in the street below [. . .] while he was above in the fresh air" (qtd. in Crowell 32). Instead of reduc- ing him to miniscule or insect-like proportions, this fly's lofty vantage point made him feel larger than life. He believed that his job enabled him to overcome the crush- ing effects of the metropolis and achieve a degree of liberation, much like the short- lived victory of Kong, who defied "the mightiest city ever erected by the hand of man" (Cooper, Wallace, and Creelman 4). Dow s claims and Cooper's description of Kong are remarkably similar to those of Michel de Certeau who, in The Practice of Everyday Life , explained his sensations while atop the 1 10th story of the World Trade Center, an experience that transformed him from a walker to a voyeur. Viewing the city from above like a flying Icarus enabled him to "leave behind the mass," the crowds, and the "nervousness of New York traffic," to virtually triumph over modernity itself (92). The dialectics of triumph and defeat inherent in skyscraper climbing, and later explored in King Kongy were corroborated by the numerous articles in the press that reported on the accidents and deaths of human flies. Part of the thrill of watching the feat was unfortunately its potential to result in all too common deadly accidents. Countering those journalists who celebrated human flies, others described the man- ner in which they were exploited economically by wealthy promoters who often secured them to publicize buildings, films, or products, and who were seduced to risk their lives without the benefit of either safety equipment or insurance for transitory fame and inadequate monetary compensation. One third of the stories concerning human flies that appeared in the New York Times from 1912-1939 concerned men who had suffered serious injuries or who had plunged to their deaths. A typical head- line read as follows: "'Human Fly' Falls as a Big Crowd Gasps." The most famous case involving the death of a human fly was directly linked to cinema, the promotion of Harold Lloyd's Safety Last (1923). Harold or "The Boy" climbs the skyscraper as a ploy to advertise his employer's department store, enacting the capitalist success ethos of upward mobility, which ultimately paves the way for the realization of his fully integrated masculinity (Illus. 6). His final achievement at the skyscraper pinnacle at the film's denouement is rewarded with his sweetheart's hand in a symbolic act of consummation. However, the real human fly, Harry Young, who was hired to scale the Martinique Hotel to advertise Safety Last fell to his death on 6 March 1923, which led New York State to outlaw these stunts. A decade later, Kong enacted a similar feat and met a similar fate. In accordance with Harold, Kong's climb represents his desire to achieve mastery</page><page sequence="14">42 Mosaic 41/2 (June 2008) 6. Harold scaling a skyscraper. Frame enlargement from Safety Last, Dir. Hal Roach, PathÃ© Studios, 1923. and union with his unlikely human love interest, which was never to be realized. As colonized other and coded minority construction worker, Kong's temporary rise was doomed to failure. Both before and after his demise, only up-and-coming white male film heroes were allowed to reach skyscraper pinnacles triumphantly. In King Kong, the stalwart, clean-cut Jack Driscoll, like Harold Lloyd before him, Ann's single- handed jungle rescuer, climbs the stairway to the Empire State Building's top for the permissible romantic finale after Kong's dramatic fall from its pinnacle. Kong's Corporation's hybrid anthropomorphism publicity apparatus, and which active characterized power was fuelled the building by the Empire itself as State the Corporation's publicity apparatus, which characterized the building itself as the product of working-class instrumentality, a view echoed by builders Starrett and Eken. The Corporation forged a multifaceted stratagem to pre-empt the idea that skyscrap- ers were monuments to individual capitalist achievement or products of the architects' genius during the Depression's darkest hours; rather, they were "constructed" as the pride of both collective and individual manly exertion, further locating Kong as an analogue of the building. It commenced with the appointment of Alfred E. Smith, a</page><page sequence="15">Merrill Schleier 43 four- term Democratic governor of New York who had recently lost to Hoover, as the Corporation's president in August of 1928. With a thick Irish accent, Smith was viewed as a champion of immigrants and the working-class, and a representative of a new Democratic liberalism, whose practical politics were rooted in the cities. He was hired to head the Corporation by his friend John Raskob, one of the major financiers of the building, and head of the Democratic National Committee. As the building's spokesman, Smith performed at various public relations events, which were reported in the media, and helped fashion the publicity materials. Belle Moskowitz, a social welfare advocate, and the photographer Lewis Hine assisted Smith in this regard. Typical of his rhetoric and Hine's photographs was the valorization of the "thousands of arms" that created the Empire State Building (Empire, Empire n.p.). Class and gender-inflected rhetoric was employed further to describe the Empire State Building as the purview and product of working-class men by the Corporation in discussions of its Fifth Avenue and Thirty-Fourth Street location, previously the site of the elite Astor Mansion (1859) and the Waldorf Astoria Hotel (1893) respec- tively. Architect and writer Rem Koolhaas asserted that the Waldorf, in particular, injected the concept of reincarnation into the Empire State Building, preserving it as a hub of activity while maintaining memories of its former owners' and occupants' affluence (132-51). Yet, I suggest that the Empire State Building's promoters wanted it both ways. They wished to retain the prestige associated with the previous build- ings; at the same time, they utilized both upper-class domiciles as foils to celebrate the triumph of working-class masculine agency over decadence. A Utopian view of employer-worker relations was offered as the keynote to the building's construction, which echoed Smith's political philosophies. Countering the socialists' views of class struggle under capitalism, he believed that rich and poor Americans held common interests. He claimed: "The bricklayer couldn't draw $6 a day if he had to carry the bricks," and "irresponsible and wanton attacks on business" were "a blow to capital and labor alike. The prosperity of the working man" depended "in large part upon the prosperity of the employer" (qtd. in Handin 80). To showcase the idea of equal opportunity regardless of one's ethnicity or class background, Jacob Astor 's story was offered in the Empire State Building's official history as a parable of the self-made man, a "penniless immigrant," whose upward climb was pictured in the soaring building, and metaphorically suggested by the ethnically diverse workers at its summit (Empire, Empire 8). This propaganda served to suggest that anyone could make it to the top, even the workers who had fashioned the building, conflating the idea of spatial ascension with economic success. The Astor Mansion and the Waldorf Astoria were defined largely as cloistered,</page><page sequence="16">7. Empire State's first advertisement, 1 May 1931. Published in Empire State: A History. New York: Empire State Corporation, 11.</page><page sequence="17">Merrill Schleier 45 upper-class feminized spaces, which were indicative of old capitalism, at odds with the naked fiinctionalism of the Empire State Building, which signified modernity. In the Empire State: A History ; upper-class femininity was juxtaposed with practical and working-class masculinity in text and image. The promoters claimed that "women and girls found in the Astor Mansion [. . .] such stuff as dreams are made of," and are "in contrast to keenly thinking business men today," who find prestige and efficiency in the new skyscraper (8-10). A wedding scene shows conspicuously dressed women who occupy a precious interior contrasted with an illustration that features the stripped-down, white skin of the Empire State Building's shaft, its phallic shape (to which skyscrapers have been likened since their inception) both penetrating and dwarfing its effeminate architectural predecessor (Illus. 7). As architectural historians Mark Wigley and Mary McLeod point out, feminine fashion and taste were often employed in binary opposition to modernism's universalizing masculinist regime, to suggest the former's temporality and artifice. As I argue in "Lewis Mumford's Gendered and Classed Modernism," American modernist architectural discourse further associ- ated upper-class femininity with the hysterical, the nervous, and the pathological, which necessitated redemption by the naked functionalist "male" body of such build- ings as the Empire State, which signified health. Kong's escape from Radio City, where he is displayed for profit to an ostentatiously-dressed audience, to the sleek, unadorned monolithic Empire State may be viewed as a quest to regain lost mas- culinity, which had been shackled by adventurism and profiteering. The defeat of feminized space is further invoked in discussions of Samuel Ward McAllister, the "dandy" and social favourite of the Waldorf Astoria and a fixture of the hotel's famed Peacock Alley. The Empire State Building's promoters described those who paraded before the Waldorf's huge gold mirrors, conjuring up scenes of sumptu- ous display and feminine narcissism: "There in the dazzling ballrooms [. . .] were seen the women whom it was an event to see" (Empire, Empire 9). The End of an Era - The Ballroom of the Waldorf Astoria served as its inverse, investing the site with violence and conflict. A construction worker in overalls and dirty work boots faces the cavernous entrance penetrated by a truck, which awaits redemption by the skyscraper (Illus. 8). This unlikely contrast of class and gender signifiers suggests images of rough-hewn Bolsheviks in the Czar's Palace on the eve of the Russian Revolution. The accompa- nying text underlines the bellicose, rapacious incursion of workers and trucks into this former bastion of privilege: "The truck, like a roaring invader, thrust its great bulk into the lobby [...]. It churned across the floor, then turned down 'Peacock Alley,' down that proud corridor lined with gold mirrors and velvet draperies" (8-10). In 1931, when eight million had lost their jobs, and the wealthy were the new villains of the day, the</page><page sequence="18">8. The End of an Era - The Ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria.

Another image of Raskob and Smith wielding the hammers and saws that dealt the first blows to the Waldorf aligns them with the manual labourers in their employ (Illus. 9). Smith followed this act of destruction with an equally significant act of origina- tion, which symbolically infused the Empire State Building with working man's labour. On the occasion of a ceremony dedicated to the laying of the Empire State Buildings cornerstone before a crowd of 5000, half of whom were construction work- ers, the trowel-wielding Smith reported to those gathered that he had formerly been a bricklayer, before he cemented the 4500-pound semi-circular stone in place. Smith acknowledged that his gesture was a public relations opportunity, while he trumpeted his own working-class qualifications to undertake the task: "I declare, and firmly, that I have a right to use this trowel as a member of the union. My dues are paid and I have my card in my office at 200 Madison Avenue" ("Governor" 27). The strategy to couple the Empire State with working-class masculinity and libidinal energy also characteristic of Kong is seen in the frequent use of inseminating metaphors by both its publicists and builders Starrett and Eken. The latter invoked English art and architectural critic John Ruskin, who wrote, "Therefore, when we build [. . .] as we lay stone upon stone, that time is to come when these stones will be sacred, because our hands have touched them, and that men will say as they look upon the labor [...]- 'See,! [sic] this our fathers did for us" (Anonymous II).1 The commemorative brochure of 16 April 1931 echoed Ruskin's sentiments, melding the mental and physical labour imparted to the structure by men. Employing Marxist- inspired jargon, the promoters described these labours as manly work: "Those who conceived it, those who designed it, those that made it by the labor of their minds, the force of their muscle, the sweat of their brows, all built into the very steel and stone of the Empire State a spirit dedicated it to the service and glory of man." Additional praise was accorded these instrumental workers for their "indomitable spirit" and "fearless energy" as they fashioned the steely skeleton high above the city streets (Empire, Commemorating n.p.). Lewis Hines heroic photographs augmented the verbal and visual rhetoric of the publicity materials. Commentators interpreted these images as Hine meant them, underscoring the "virile quality of the workers" (Jenkins 637). With the assistance of the social welfare magazine Survey Graphic , Hine had earlier chronicled "railroad workers, power workers, men in factories with dynamos and great levers and gears," a virtual paean to their instrumental masculinity (qtd. in McCausland 503). This led to</page><page sequence="20">48 Mosaic 41/2 (June 2008) 9. Messr. Raskob and Smith Begin to Demolish the Waldorf. Published in Empire State: A History, New York: Empire State Corporation, 1931. 23. a commission to photograph workers engaged in the construction of the Empire State Building, which highlighted both their collective efforts and each of their particular contributions. Unlike his previous socially-conscious photographs, which served as sharp indictments of corporate exploitation, in the Empire State commission, he resolved to document the positive side of labour at a time, ironically, when the worker "was as underprivileged as the kid in the mill" (qtd. in McCausland 504). Thus, he dedicated his later book Men at Work to all the "men of courage, skill, daring and imagination." "Cities do not build themselves," Hine declared, "unless back of them all are the brains and toil of men" (n.p.). Illustrations and captions identified the spe- cialized jobs of drillers, riveters, and derrick men, among others, evoking an earlier, romanticized version of artisanal labour when men had pride and control over the production process. Hine took issue with the current vogue for photographs of dis- embodied machines, which he viewed as both disempowering and dishonest. Echoing</page><page sequence="21">Merrill Schleier 49 the gender and class-inflected language of the Empire State Building's promoters, art critic Elizabeth McCausland claimed that his workers had "no false aestheticism [. . .] no preciousness or spiritual aloofness," features which described the upper-class denizens of the Waldorf (503). A labourers 1931 article was in more Fortune equivocal magazine concerning that featured the creative, similar images non-alienated of individualized labour of labourers was more equivocal concerning the creative, non-alienated labour of skyscraper building, which was at odds with Hine's visual rhetoric. Hence, the build- ing was simultaneously viewed as a monument to modernity and a dangerous, indomitable giant. A photograph bearing the title The Artisans are Dead appeared below workmen high atop the city, with the assertion that tall buildings engendered a new definition of workmanship. However, the caption below the image contained a telling double entendre, which pointed to the inherent hazards of skyscraper build- ing: "The master- workmen of our time drive steel to steel with hammer strokes of air [. . .]. And their necks are still breakable" ("Skyscraper" 92). Builder Col. W.A. Starrett prefigured Fortune's concerns; he reported in Skyscrapers and the Men Who Build Them , several years prior to his employment by the Empire State Corporation, that intermittency in employment, accidents, and the threat of death rendered this job a "killer" in spite of the "young, virile men with nonchalant manner [sic], who so con- fidently go about their tasks" (94). The view of empowered, manly labour infused into the Empire State Building by Hine and others was at variance with the Corporation's Fordist strategy of efficiency and factory-like discipline, which subjected workers to a rigorous work schedule and uncompromising deadlines, enabling Starrett and Eken to complete the building in a record eighteen months and two million dollars below budget. "So perfect was the planning, so exact the fulfillment of schedule that workmen scarcely had to reach for what they next required," the official history proudly reported. "The moment of depar- ture from the storage place, the length of time allowed for moving through traffic, and the precise moment of arrival at the site of the Empire State, all were calculated, sched- uled and fulfilled with absolute precision," they boasted further (Empire, Empire 32-33). Miniature railways, an overhead monorail, internal hoists, and huge brick hop- pers, among other innovative machines were celebrated for their speed and supplanted the necessity of the human touch. As Shreve, one of the architects, reported, it was "like an assembly line - the assembly of standard parts" (qtd. in P. Starrett 296). This view of factory-like efficiency did not coincide with the independent artisans of Hine's photographs and the Corporations rhetoric. As Terry Smith has pointed out in his book, Making the Modernt in a discussion of the Ford Motor plant, the assembly-line</page><page sequence="22">50 Mosaic 41/2 (June 2008) efficiency model subjected the three-dimensional bodies of men to a flattened, two- dimensional grid. Work was often accelerated to fit a predetermined and highly ration- alized schedule of completion, in which workers became mere adjuncts to the production process (18-55). Builder Paul Starrett claimed proudly that he convinced the Empire State Corporation to hire his company precisely because "the value of the site, the money invested, and the potential revenue from the building" necessitated an accelerated building schedule. "'Our fee is insignificant compared with the amount we will save you by shortening the time of construction,'" he informed the financiers (289). Thus, the Corporation's presentation of an image of Fordist efficiency and inspired, autonomous labour deftly melded previously discordant discourses, fashioning the building as both a paragon of modernity and technological innovation and a product of pre-industrial, working-class masculinity, a dialectic similar to that of the building and Kong. In spite of the Corporation's claims of efficiency, the deaths of construction workers, who often lost their lives because of human error or the negligence of builders, was still a highly charged issue at the time. As Fortune magazine reported in 1931, there was an old adage that it cost a life a floor to build a skyscraper and that a bloodless building was still considered a marvel ("Skyscraper" 92). Perhaps to counter this stereotype, Empire State builders Starrett and Eken celebrated the sophisticated safety measures that were taken to avoid the loss of human life, which included the selection of a safety assistant to supervise all its security agencies and the appointment of additional foremen to correct all hazardous conditions. In spite of these measures, Starrett and Eken claimed defensively that seven people had indeed died on the job. "It is an extremely regrettable fact that this happened, but these lives were lost through accidents which occurred due to the normal hazards of modern buildings and cer- tainly not, as charged, to human indifference and neglect" ("Notes" 73). The Travelers Insurance Company, which insured skyscraper corporations against industrial acci- dents, still found these deaths excessive in 1930, asserting that a maximum of two deaths was all that should be permitted ("Skyscraper" 92). It could even be argued that, in spite of the safety precautions taken, the builders' gruelling thirteen-hour work day, which began at 3:30 a.m., and the relentless job schedule may have resulted in needless tragedies. While it is impossible to assess whose appraisal of the Empire State Building's skyscraper deaths is correct, the self-interested Corporation's or the equally pecuniary-minded actuaries who were reluctant to pay out benefits, skyscraper acci- dents were still a grim reality for construction workers and their families. Thus, if Kong was defeated by the forces of civilization and technology, as writer and director Merian C. Cooper conceived him initially, then the loss of employment and the tragic deaths of the skyscraper's immigrant labour force must be seen as part of his story.</page><page sequence="23">Merrill Schleier 51 10. Kong plunges to his death from atop the Empire State Building. Frame enlargement from King Kong, Dirs. Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, RKO Radio Pictures, 1933. Kong's plunge further served as a potent image during the Depression when sky- scraper suicides were common tabloid headlines and represented the despair occa- sioned by men's lost fortunes, livelihoods, and self-respect, imbuing the tiny falling body with traces of working class demotion (Illus. 10). Writing in the New York Times , an observer noted the spatial discrepancy between the heady optimism that occasioned the Empire State Building and the Depression's dire consequences: "America's tallest skyscraper lifts its 1248 feet of office space [. . .] at a time when America's business is believed to be 'scraping the bottom'" ("Everest" 24). The irony of the Empire State Building's triumphant completion was that over 3500 men were laid off after they had</page><page sequence="24">52 Mosaic 41/2 (June 2008) reached their pinnacle, like Kong. In an imaginary monologue from one skyboy to another, a World-Telegram journalist gave voice to a construction worker's despair at his own unemployment while alluding to the fatality of a comrade: It seems a long time now, that day when the forge fire glowed right in the middle of the eighty-sixth floor and the tower was just a mass of steel girding against a rainy sky. Its dif- ferent now. Everything is warm and cozy up here. Men in spats are standing in line, at $1 per, to look out over the bulwarks. [. . .] I got to thinking to-day [sic] and I tried to pick out the shaft that carpenter went down. I couldn't find it. ("Skyboys" 31) Thus, Kong and the Empire State Building are dialectically related in the film's epic conclusion; both are literal and figurative embodiments of the Depression's mul- tiethnic working-class skyscraper labourers, at once powerful symbols of instrumen- tal masculinity and upward mobility and the victims of modernity's exacting regime, which resulted in their defeat. The gigantic, muscular Kong and the Empire State Building's pre-eminent steeliness bear an uncanny resemblance; indeed, the ape fuses with his nemesis as he crowns its pinnacle, as its tower becomes part of his anatomy. In accordance with the human flies who climbed for fame, economic reward, and to distinguish themselves from their working-class brethren, the speck-like Kong seen in the long shot becomes large for a moment longer, allowing him to achieve temporary mastery over Manhattan. Writer and director Merian C. Cooper and Kong's designer Willis O'Brien were inspired, in part, by New York's open air skyscraper performances by a multiethnic labour force and the Empire State Corporation's multifaceted verbal and visual media campaign to lionize the multitude of brawny arms that forged the building. Democratic Party operative Alfred E. Smith wished to ward off potential crit- icism of capitalism's pre-eminent monument at a time when such a grand individual achievement could be construed as upper-class avarice. Yet, Smith's own working-class roots and public relations gambits and Hine's photographs could not undo the effects of the economic debacle, which the Empire State's labourers knew only too well. Hence, Kong's plunge signifies, in part, the multivalent effects of exploitation and unemploy- ment, loss of manly purpose, and even death during the Great Depression. As in other skyscraper films, greed and exploitation are renounced; normative heterosexuality is restored, while enabling audience members to identify with the human-like ape's plight.</page><page sequence="25">Merrill Schleier 53 NOTES 1/ The source of this quote, "Notes on the Construction of the Empire State," is an unpublished notebook that was found among the papers of Starrett and Eken Builders.
