<plain_text><page sequence="1">Young Man Geertz: A Senior Paper (1949) BY CLIFFORD GEERTZ Volume 67, Number 4 Fall 2009 Clifford Geertz was a noted anthropologist, a long-time fellow at the Institute of Ad- vanced Studies at Princeton, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award, and until his death in 2006, a member of the Antioch Review's National Advisory Board. I. Preface The first day I came to Antioch, I wandered up by the Catholic Church looking for the college; the catalog had flooded my head with image and idea and had said the towers would be visible for fifty miles. My suitcase was heavy, everything I had brought from California was in it, and I was afraid to ask anyone about the location of the college, because I didn't know how wise it was to reveal the fact that one was new. Finally, however, I did ask someone, because it was dreadfully hot and I had begun to fear that I would never find the place, that I had got off at the wrong station, or that there was no college at all and those pamphlets and forms had only been someone's idea of a practi- cal joke. Even when directed, I had difficulty, and I was only about fifty feet away from the main building when I first saw the towers so grandiosely described. I have not read a catalog with an even mind since. Prose, to draw the moral clearly for the unimaginative, should not obstruct the mind, but rather, as Miss Bowen says, "make objects ap- pear brighter than themselves, as in very clear morning light, instead of darkening behind a mesh of words." Too much at Antioch does</page><page sequence="2">Our Seventh Decade 935 obstruct; the mesh of words seems at times almost impenetrable. The senior paper institution, unfortunately, is no exception, as a glance at last year's final Antiochian will show. In some hands it seems like the last step of the humiliation, the final drawing of a curtain of words between the individual and experience. All of us, as Ernest Schachtel has lately said, tend to schematize our experience, to drown our pasts in a sea of symbols, leaving place-names as the result of travel, clichés the sediment of feeling, and mouthings about "the good life," "basic value patterns," and "personal goals" as the precipitates of education. If such a starvation of the self is to be at all avoided and "clear morn- ing light" is to be at all gained, the gap between experience and words must be somehow narrowed; for as Schachtel says, "It is only in those experiences that transcend the conventional memory schemata, that every new insight . . . has its origin." What then: free association? Hardly. I intend no spiritual strip- tease, as I think it would embarrass us both. Besides, new insights are rare, and I cannot hope to run off a whole string of them here for you now, like a magician drawing beads out of his ears. But by scrupu- lously avoiding the usual Antioch terminology, the easy flow of famil- iar words, and by attempting to discuss my experience at the college in a language somewhat less Procrustean than the syllabus suggests, I hope to tell you at least something about me of significance; for if I do not bring you closer to me than the catalog brought me to Antioch, this paper becomes but an exercise in obedience, a final lie. Attitudes are what you are after- what Charles Morris would call "dispositions toward behavior"- and the best way I can think to re- veal them to you, is to present my reflections on some problems now abroad in the world, drawing from time to time on history- personal and cultural- to light them up. I have always been more operationally inclined than genetic, and thus I shall probably emphasize the horizon- tal element of my "personality" more than the vertical: but that is to be expected of young people. At any rate, if I can pick my problems carefully enough, I should be able to bring a good portion of my psy- chological and cultural equipment into play; more, certainly, than if I announced to you that, as the catalog says of Antioch graduates, "I am prepared to live a full life to the limit of my individual potentialities." I should like to take my cue then, so far as method is concerned, from the great French writer André Gide, who during the war was faced with a problem similar to the one I meet here- though at a much more intense and serious level. Gide, an anti-fascist living in occupied</page><page sequence="3">936 The Antioch Review France, adopted the form of the imaginary interview as a method of getting into French newspapers things that could not otherwise have been printed there after June 1940. He invented for himself an inter- rogator (from the book-section of the French paper Le Figaro , where the "interviews" were originally printed), and though the "interviews" that resulted were ostensibly about such things as the revival of French poetry, the rules that might govern a novel, the cast-iron traditions of French verse, and the decay of the subjunctive mood, they turn out on closer reading not to be dealing with their purported subject matter, but with far wider issues. What Gide was actually attempting was a re- examination of the French "soul" at a time of crisis, when a more di- rect approach was impossible. He could do this because (as Malcolm Cowley has said) "almost the whole of French and European culture, past and contemporary, is simultaneously present in his mind," and (as he himself has written) "the principal difficulty of [his] style continu- ally suggests rather than affirms and proceeds by insinuations." I do not, of course, have Gide's censorship difficulties, nor certain- ly his tremendous cultural memory or brilliant prose style. Neverthe- less, by adopting M. Gide's imaginary interview form, I hope not only to reveal what prose style I do have, but also (as I have said) to reveal my personal attitudes toward my culture, my self, and "significant oth- ers," which is what I suppose the syllabus to mean by "values." All that is left then, is a process of scaling down: my interviewer comes not from Le Figaro, but from The Record : Imaginary Interview- 1 Like a good newspaper reporter, he came in without knocking. He sat down in the chair by the window, turning it away from the glass, toward the center of the room, reminding me of Laswell's comment that "leaders" prefer to sit in the light, because, psychologically, it enhances their power over the "group." "You know who I am?" he asked. "Does God know Adam?" I said, trying to cut him down. "It was merely a civil question," he said, obviously hurt. "One must begin with something after all- and even small talk has its uses." "Yes ... I suppose so. I'm sorry I snapped at you. These are diffi- cult days, and I suppose everyone is a little on edge- admit it or not. If it lasts much longer, we shall all be spitting at one another constantly,</page><page sequence="4">Our Seventh Decade 937 and we shall have to have a war, just to relieve the tension." "My, but you sound gloomy. What brought all this on- the Rus- sian A-bomb?" "Well, hardly- things didn't exactly begin with that- though I must admit that the announcement brought the whole thing more sharply into relief again. Since Berlin and that business, there was some relaxation of the strain. I suppose that is how it will go though- a kind of sinusoidal motion, with the tension building up to one crisis peak after another as various problems arise, and then, at the top, ei- ther spilling over into war, or, like a wave, receding to gather strength for the next onrush." "You think there will be another war then?" "I certainly don't know. And I doubt I or anyone else will know with much certainty more than a week before it happens. Each time the tension rises, we shall have to recount the probabilities and cross our fingers until at the end we shall have callouses on our knuckles. It may go on through the century that way, building up and letting down, until we become like rabbits, quick to jump at the slightest noise- our hackles rising each time someone behind the iron curtain rattles an official paper." "And if there is a war- what then?" "I don't know. I can't see beyond a war- beyond its opening day. All my weapons of predictability so carefully built from my knowl- edge over the years are useless there. A war for me is like an opaque wall built across life- mine as well as the culture's. I have no idea what the wall itself would be like, or what (if anything) would be beyond it- except for a grounded suspicion that it would not be par- ticularly good- at least by present standards. When I see the discus- sions of "strategy" for the next war in the popular press (both Mr. David Lawrence's and Mr. Henry Luce's publications are fond of such day-dreaming), or hear about them before congressional committees, it always seems meaningless to me- not only because I am appalled by the stupidity- but because I cannot even imagine what another war would be like, nor another postwar, if there was one. Perhaps we would get through it as we got through the last two, perhaps not- I simply can't picture it." "I know how you feel," he said, after he stopped scribbling me into his notebook. "None of us, including all the armchair (or real) generals who do all the 'planning' really have much idea what the future is to be like. Americans have always crowed how they were</page><page sequence="5">938 The Antioch Review fond of uncertainty and novelty, and now they have as much as they could possibly desire- certainly no future has ever been so unpredict- able as ours is right now. I saw in Life magazine the other week that a physicist is claiming there will be more change in the way people live their lives in the next thirty years than there has been in the last three hundred." "Yes. We are all of us living high-probability lives. The only dif- ference from the American dream is that we are no longer creating the probability or dealing creatively with it (which, no matter what your economics, you must admit, the robber-barons certainly did), but merely suffering it." "Who knows?" he said, "Perhaps that is the best thing we can do. Have you ever read the Forster essay called 'What I Believe'?" "Yes, I have. Forster is a particular favorite of mine." "Well, if you recall, he gives in that essay, what has always seemed to me to be the best attitude to take in a time such as ours, a time Auden calls the 'age of anxiety.' Forster says history shows that man has al- ways insisted on behaving creatively under the shadow of the sword, and that we had better follow that example under the shadow of the airplanes. He says he looks the other way until fate strikes him- and that if men hadn't looked the other way, when force was about, in the past, nothing of any value would survive. He has a wonderful line in that piece which I read so many times during the war it is stuck in my mind forever: 'the people I respect most behave,' he says, 'as if they were immortal and as if society were eternal. Both assumptions are false: both of them must be accepted as true if we are to go on eating and working and loving, and are to keep open a few breathing holes for the human spirit.' I must admit, this seems to strike me right- and it is certainly one way to live in this day." "Yes," I said, "it is one way. Coasting down a rushing river in an uncontrollable boat- say toward a waterfall- we can spend our time, not in deathly fear of the certain fate awaiting us, but playing in the bottom of the boat, making what Cyril Connolly has called 'the un- breakable toys of the mind, the mud-pies that endure.' But it is some- how unsatisfactory to me as a complete attitude, no matter how strong my reverence for art, perhaps because it assumes, almost a priori as it were, that the boat is uncontrollable. If I remember Forster's es- say, there is a more hopeful and positive note in it, which you seem to have overlooked. Not a particularly sanguine one, but at least an alternative of a sort to defeatism, which no matter how subtle it may</page><page sequence="6">Our Seventh Decade 939 be the other doctrine most certainly is." "I don't remember what you mean." "Well, due to an unfortunate grammar school experience concern- ing a terrible poem by Tennyson, I can never memorize anything. But, I have a copy of the essay over in my bookcase in an anthology Som- erset Maugham edited a decade or so ago . . . I'll get it ... I have it here in my 'spiritual sustenance' section with Gide's notebooks, Waiden , Abinger Harvest y and Montaigne's essay ... let me find the page now ... eh, here is what I want- I have it marked with an exclamation point: The Savior of the future [he writes]- if ever he comes- will not preach a new gospel. He will merely utilize my aristocracy (of the sensitive, the considerate and the plucky as he writes earlier); he will make effective the good will and the good temper, which are already existing. In other words he will introduce a new technique. In economics, we are told that if there was a new technique of distribution, there need be no poverty, and people would not starve in one place while crops are dug under in another. A similar change is needed in the sphere of morals and politics. The desire for it is by no means new; it was expressed, for example, in theological terms by Jacopone da Todi over six hundred years ago. "Ordina Questo amore, О tu che mi ami," he said ("О thou who lovest me, set this love in order"). His prayer was not granted and I do not myself believe that it ever will be, but here and not through a change of heart, is our probable route. Not by becoming better, but by ordering and distributing his native goodness, will man shut up force into its box, and so gain time to explore the universe and to set his mark upon it worthily. "And here, on page 356, he considers Christianity as a way out: Such a change, claim the orthodox, can only be made by Christianity and will be made by it in God's good time. Man always has failed and always will fail to organize his own goodness, and it is presumptuous of him to try. This claim leaves me cold, I cannot believe that Christianity will ever cope with the present world-wide mess, and I think that such influence as it retains in modern society is due to its financial back- ing rather than to its spiritual appeal. It was a spiritual force once, but the indwelling spirit will have to be restated if it is to calm the waters again, and probably in a non- Christian form. "I could go on reading this tremendous essay- but that is what I wanted you to remember: the new technique. That, and I am not so ter- ribly hopeful either, is our possible way out, and we must try it at least once more if we are to hold up our heads as liberals and humanists." "Yes, I had forgotten that passage. But, isn't the question begged? Just what technique are we going to use?" "Well, I certainly would not have the temerity to respond to a ques- tion like that. Only those fascinated with a Movement or a Method</page><page sequence="7">940 The Antioch Review (such as I sometimes fear the Antioch Administration is) could answer without uncertainty, or would assume there was one technique. All I'm arguing for is a way of life, in times like these." "What you are saying then is that we should all give up our play- ing with 'mud-pies' and go on a search for techniques to deal with social problems?" "No, at least I don't think I am. I don't think that Forster's first point, about being creative under the shadow of the sword, is neces- sarily incompatible with the second point about trying to deal intelli- gently with the world. If I did, I would probably go along with you on just the first point, because, personally, art has always meant more to me than social science, and the only way I could indulge very happily in science at all would be to feel that it would help preserve and foster the creative aspects in man. After all it is not just politics that are at a sorry stage, but so is art, with most of the people not experiencing it at all in any decent sense. But let me make it clearer before we close and we can go on next time. There are perhaps three main ways to live one's life: a religious, a scientific, and an aesthetic." "That seems a little neat. But just what do mean by such a divi- sion?" "Well," I said, " that is rather a long story. It is already late- per- haps we had better save it until next time." "All right, perhaps we had. I do have enough for this week. May I come again on Tuesday? That is our deadline." "O.K. But make it sometime in the afternoon- I have some work to do in the morning. I have to get at things as soon as I get up, or they get away from me and [the] day gets wasted." Imaginary Interview- 2 He came a little after two, through the rain, and it was apparent that he had been thinking a lot about our conversation of the week before, because he started right off, without his precious "small talk," to con- tinue the train of thought. "You said there were three main ways to live one's life: a reli- gious, a scientific and an aesthetic. I suppose that is a good enough categorization as any, as long as you realize that is just what it is. My feeling is, I suppose like most other people, that life cannot be cut up into various pieces, but must be lived whole."</page><page sequence="8">Our Seventh Decade 941 "True, it must be lived whole, but it can be looked at in different ways, at different times and from different standpoints, so as to enrich it and discover more meanings in it. That is what Santayana means when he says 'life is lyric in its ideal, tragic in its fate, and comic in its existence.' The scientist, the religious person, and the artist all see experience in different aspects- and, as you said, most of us on the common-sense level feel we would like to employ each of their van- tage points so as not to miss anything in living. The big question is, I guess, how far is possible. My feeling is that it is not possible, unless all these standpoints alter a little from what they have traditionally been, so as to be able to include values from the others." "Well, perhaps we had better get off the abstraction ladder. What do you mean by the religious, aesthetic, and scientific ways of life? How are they different?" "True. That is wisest. One way to classify these various philoso- phies of life is as T. V. Smith has somewhere- by noting in individual men what attitudes they take toward what happens in their heads. Put- ting aside more epistemological questions about trees in here and trees out there, questions which I feel at least, more often lead to a headache than they do to anything profitable in terms of living , we can still judge a man's feelings about life in terms of how he regards his ideas. For example, if you are built one way, you may count ideas in your head as having their chief significance by virtue of a superior reality to which they point you. Plato, I guess, is the prime example here- or Bishop Berkeley. The Plato in Socrates, in fact made the best statement of it, for my money, at the end of the famous book six of The Republic. I jotted it down for you: Now, that which imparts truth to the known and the power of knowing to the knower is what I would have you term the idea of the good, and this you will deem to be the cause of science, and of truth in so far as the latter becomes the subject of knowledge; beautiful too, as are both truth and knowledge, you will be right in esteeming this other nature as more beautiful than either; and, as in the previous instance, light and sight may be truly said to be like the sun, and yet not to be the sun, so in this other sphere, science and truth may be deemed to be like the good, but not the good; the good has a place of honor yet higher. "At any rate, this religious way judges thinking in terms of its use in leading to a deity, and in its firm faith that: 'Above the forest of Parakeets / A Parakeet of Parakeets prevails.'" "This I take it," he said, laughing, "you would reject?" "Yes, like Montaigne, I have always found two things to be in</page><page sequence="9">942 The Antioch Review singular accord: supercelestial thoughts and subterranean conduct. The amount of damage done to the human spirit in the name of a higher reality than his is legion, and evil never seems to be done with such vengeance as when done by truly 'other-worldly' characters. There are many things I don't like about traditional, supernatural religion: the way it explains away evil, for example. I agree with William James, I am afraid, that whatever God is, he is certainly no gentleman- and it seems to me that a perception of the dirt and grime of the world is a prerequisite for maturity or for overcoming it. I could go on with this, better men than I have shown up the essential inhumanity of tradi- tional religious supernaturalism and its philosophical apologist, ideal- ism, but that is not what I mainly want to say. I'm not sure, that this transcendental approach to life is the only way of life, rightfully to be called religious. I have always regarded myself both as a religious per- son and a strict naturalist and never thought it a contradiction. I don't go to church, and almost never have, even as a child, but I have con- stantly felt a wonder and reverence both toward myself and the world around me- something of the sort of thing D.H. Lawrence or Spinoza felt, to choose quite different sorts of people. Horatio's speech about there being more things in heaven and earth than we dream of in our philosophies seems to me to the point, and yet the infinite doesn't frighten me into the arms of the church as it did Pascal, but more thrills me with its possibilities as it did Bruno. Perhaps this is a juve- nile approach, or a kind of 'cosmic impiety' that humanists are always being accused of, but I think that life is at its basis both pleasureful and powerful and I think that the perception of this through the afflictions that goad us, torture us, and finally kill us, and what it means for man 'alone and afraid / in a world he never made,' is what is meant by reli- gion. The power of the universe does not seem awful to me as it does to the church, or to Bertrand Russell, but I feel man's power comes because he is a continuous part of the larger power of the universe and as he becomes more human and can understand and grapple with the many things that drive him, he becomes more able to live the kind of life he was born to live. This is not mere power- worship, but that self- love that Erich Fromm has said lies at the basis of man's nature- a self-love that includes a love for others, and is identical with it. The golden rule for this kind of religion is not the semi-calculating one of the scriptures, 'as ye judge others, so shall ye be judged,' but, follow- ing H. S. Sullivan and modern psychiatry, 'as you judge yourself, so shall you judge others.' Love and respect of oneself is identical with</page><page sequence="10">Our Seventh Decade 943 love and respect of others- if one does not respect the human in him- self, he will not respect it in others." "I, of course, agree with you. But the problem the average theo- logian would raise at this point would be, I think, is this 'good-fellow feeling' and fuzzy general warmth toward the world really religion? Santayana, if I remember rightly, said of Whitman that his panthe- ism, unlike that of the Stoics and of Spinoza, was unintellectual, lazy and self-indulgent; for he simply felt jovially that everything real was good enough, and that he was good enough himself. Does your 'reli- gion' really reach to what is vital?" "Certainly it does for me. As a kid I went to Sunday school at the community church. And what do I remember- what seems warm and emotional and important to me now? The stories? The 'sermons'? No and no. What I remember is a pageant I was in where I played the third wise man and carried frankincense, and how awful it smelled (like I had the measles), and how the artificial beard so hurriedly applied by the minister's wife itched like mad so that I wanted to drop the incense and scratch. I remember the large wooden map we made, hours after church, with Christmas-tree lights to show where Jesus had gone. But what I remember most was how frightened and how proud and how excited I was. I felt a bond between myself and the townspeople and the little town where I lived, that is still with me- a secret understand- ing between all of us that we all know what we were and where we were-" "True, but that is a child's approach to religion-" "But all religion should be naïve. That is the use of it. As children we grow up on wonder and a feeling for the immediacy of the world, but grown up we all too often lose touch with things and become emp- ty caricatures of what we might have been. We lose our feeling for the organic relation of ourselves to the world, become alienated and feel that somewhere we have been cheated, have left paradise and can't return. We have abstracted away our experience- it is the function of religion, and, in a different way, art, to keep us from doing that. Just before you came I was reading a new pocket-book I got from the bookstore, called Indians of the Americas, by John Collier, a former commissioner of Indian Affairs. He starts off his first chapter, entitled 'The American Indian and the Long Hope' with this: They had what the world has lost. They have it now. What the world has lost, the world must have again, lest it die. Not many years are left to have or have not, to recapture the lost ingredient. This is not merely a passing reference to World War II</page><page sequence="11">944 The Antioch Review or to the atom bomb- although the reference includes these ways of death too. These deaths will mean the end if they come- racial death, self-inflicted because we have lost the way, and the power to live is dead. What, in our human world, is this power to live? It is the ancient, lost reverence and passion for the human personality, joined with the ancient, lost reverence and passion for the earth and its web of life. This in- divisible reverence and passion is what the American Indians almost universally had; and representative groups of them have it still. They had and have this power for liv- ing which our modern world has lost- as a world- view and self- view, as tradition and institution, as practical philosophy dominating their societies and as an art supreme among all the arts. "This is not to preach another return to the savage- we have things, obviously, that the red man does not, important things like flush toilets and automobiles, but if that is all we have we shall not get far on this earth. Perhaps, our almost unconscious reverence for the primitive life, like that for childhood, is the half-recognition that those people have something we once had and lost, but still want and need badly. Do you follow me?" "I think so." "Maybe I can make clearer what I mean. Here at Antioch about three years ago, I was very much in love- or thought I was. I was in love with the kind of total participation that is possible perhaps only to those who experience such a thing for the first time- involved so blindly that I could not see that its continuance was impossible, that it had the seeds of its own destruction: 'It was begotten by Despair / Upon Impossibility.' When the blow came, as it had to, from the girl, because I could never have seen how awful it all was, it came with desperate suddenness- and I felt suddenly cut off, from love, from life, from everything. For months I went over and over in my mind what had happened, entangled in coils of introspection. I would walk for hours, thinking madly, perhaps because I had relied so much on the intellectual as a child for a way out, and would return, exhausted, no better off, and having seen little outside of the tortured pattern of my own mind. Finally, after many things had happened, I one day saw the world again. I cannot describe the experience- but the feeling one gets just by seeing things at a distance again, of feeling grass, and no- ticing sky is a tremendous one, and, I think, a religious one. The point to this is that it was the beginning of the road back for me, back to the place where I was no longer so alienated from nature and to where I could fall in love again, this time with a richer understanding of what it meant (wasn't it Elizabeth Bowen in The Death of the Heart who said that experience is never really meaningful until it is repeated?), I</page><page sequence="12">Our Seventh Decade 945 recaptured once more that feeling of a bond between what goes on in- side me and what goes on outside, the precious balance in the 'web of life.' Carl Jung has said that man is like a veil suspended precariously between the infinite inner and outer worlds of nature- if so, it is the function of religion to render that veil transparent." "But, if I may play the devil's disciple, once more, what about death?- can your naturalism deal with that?" "I think it is traditional theology that hasn't been able to deal with it. It is quite true that the great lack of many secular philosophies is an avoidance of that problem, and, as man is probably the only animal who realizes he is mortal, attitudes toward death are quite revelatory of all kinds of things. As for me, I suppose I am as afraid of death as anyone- a humanist who feels life worthful must thus feel death a su- preme tragedy- but I feel also that death is a fact of human existence, most likely an ineradicable one, and that it must be faced but cannot be fully understood. It is impossible to discuss death in terms of life, as the supernaturalists have with their anthropomorphic heavens and hells, but yet it cannot be ignored as you point out so many progress- minded 'liberals' have done. "'Liberal hopefulness' regards death as a mere border to an im- proving picture, as Empson says. Perhaps, that is also one of the main functions of religion, to help man symbolize his attitudes toward death as well as life, and to come to terms with it, rather than to explain it away or soften into a kind of non-existence. Greek tragedy is an ex- cellent example of an attempt on the part of a whole people to deal with the problem- to symbolize the meaning of death to the living man- and that is why the plays were not only works of art to the Greeks, but religious rituals. But we are getting off the track. Perhaps we had better stop for today, and take up the next 'way of life,' the scientific, next time." "I will see you then," he said, "on Tuesday?" "On Tuesday," I said. Imaginary Interview- 3 "As I remember it," he said, "we were going on to the second of your 'ways of life,' today. The first one was the religious, and was defined in terms of the attitude men take toward what happens inside their</page><page sequence="13">946 The Antioch Review skulls. Are you going to define the next, that is, the scientific, that way too?" "Yes, I had planned to. That is why I took that approach to start with- because, as Smith did, all three standpoints can be clarified that way. However, it is only one way to do the job, and if it bothers you we could try another method of definition." "No. So far it seems quite clear to me. So then, what is the so- called scientific attitude toward one's personal ideas?" "Mainly, I would say, that they are not so personal as they might seem, but are in fact quite public. Ideas, according to people who take this tack, have their meaning in pointing back to the concrete world out of which they arise and their value is in solving problems and im- proving the environment for man. That is why Dewey's 'experience' includes just about everything- both the natural world and the ideas in our heads- he recognizes no discontinuity between them. Ideas are to be treated as hypotheses to be verified in action, just as the scientist in a limited field uses ideas to direct experimentation for the solution of a specific problem. This is the scientific way of life, whether in the laboratory or out." "That, I take it," he said, "is what we were talking about at the start, a couple weeks ago- only, then you called hypotheses 'tech- niques.'" "Yes, exactly. But maybe a couple examples of the importance of 'technique' and thus of the view of mind as a tool of man would help clarify things. I thought I could take two from current investigations in two widely separated modern fields of inquiry- logic and aesthet- ics-because they would be more clearcut than anything I might drag up out of my own experience. We can come back to that later." "Those should be far enough apart," he said, "to assure a wide spread of your point of view." "Yes, that is one reason I chose them. To take logic first, Ernest Nagel recently wrote an essay called 'Logic Without Ontology,' which was, for me at least, the most clarifying thing yet written on the na- ture and function of logical analysis. Briefly, Nagel, quite adequately I feel, dismisses those theories which hold that the 'laws' of logic are ontological, mentalistic, or empiricist in nature, and claims that they are primarily regulative. Now what does this mean? First, it means that logical principles are prescriptive not descriptive - they are, in short, statements of the minimal conditions for discourse without confusion, for they state at least some of the requirements for a precise language.</page><page sequence="14">Our Seventh Decade 947 Logic is, then, as I set out to indicate, a technique. The various modern approaches to formal logic must be viewed not as accounts of the 'true nature' of an antecedently identifiable relation of 'implication,' but as alternative proposals for specifying usages and performing interfer- ences. If science is to be defined as the 'putting of questions to nature,' it is obvious, that in some crucial way, the answer one gets depends on the structure of the question asked: that is what I mean by tech- nique-and what other people mean, usually, by scientific method. True, it can be over-emphasized, this methodology; it is obvious that the answer does not wholly depend on the structure of the question (as the neo-Kantians would seem to have it), but partially on the actual structure of the external world to which the question is put- that is why some logical systems are 'better,' that is, more adequate, than others, and why experiment is so crucial to scientific method- but it is still quite important. Perhaps you remember one of Wallace Stevens's 'Six Significant Landscapes':" Rationalists, wearing square hats, Think in square rooms, Looking at the floor, Looking at the ceiling. They confine themselves To right-angled triangles. If they tried rhomboids, Cones, waving lines, ellipses- As, for example, the ellipse of the half-moon- Rationalists would wear sombreros. "Well," he said, "it is easy enough to see your point as to logic and natural science, but in art it seems to me you are going to have more trouble." "More trouble, yes- it is more complex. But just as clear when one thinks about it. To start again with a concrete example, have you read Mark Schorer's essay 'Technique as Discovery?'" "No." "Well, again briefly- I don't want to bore you- Schorer claims that when we speak of technique in art we speak, as he puts it, 'of nearly everything,' for technique is the means by which the artist's experience, which is his subject matter, compels him to attend to it; technique is the only means he has of discovering its meaning, and, finally, of evaluating it. A large share of modern aesthetic criticism, Schorer says, and I must say I agree with him, has supported this view</page><page sequence="15">948 The Antioch Review with much excellent evidence, saying that to speak of content as such is not to speak of art at all, but of experience (in the narrow un-Dew- eyian sense); and that it is only when we speak of achieved content, the form, the work of art as work of art, that we speak as critics. This difference between content, or experience, and achieved content, or art, is technique." "But doesn't this give a thin aesthetic? Isn't it true that those writers who are most conscious of technique usually are the least sat- isfying and 'full-blooded'?" "The second question is, I am afraid, more a prejudice (a common one to be sure) than a result of close contact with much art, and at any rate must be answered by actual investigation I can't very well con- duct now; but the first has something to it. It is true that if the 'experi- ence' is not there in the first place, nothing can be mined out with the best techniques in the world- without original content there can be no achieved content- anymore than the laws of logic can operate in a vacuum, but must start and end with 'experience.' But, as in logic, it is also true that certain artistic techniques are sharper tools than others, and will discover more in a given 'experience,' that the writer capable of the most exacting scrutiny of his subject matter will produce works with the most satisfying content. As Auden said once, modern man's trouble is not that he doesn't have experience, but that he doesn't know what to do with it. On all sides, modern art seems, like modern science, preoccupied with technique. For example, one could point to what Joseph Frank has called the 'specialization of modern literature'; that is, the attempt to weave the time dimension into a spatial literary pattern, in such writers as Joyce, Proust (more than any other per- haps), Kafka, and Barnes; or the recognition of the flat picture plane in modern painting, or the reaction against tonality in much of modern music. The point to be made, however, was merely that technique is a crucial element in all fields these days." "It seems to me we are a long way from Dewey- closer, perhaps, to the rationalists who like to sit around and spin theories out of their bellies like so many spiders." "No. As I said, and thought emphasized, technique is regulative and prescriptive. It is a method of really doing something, and is vali- dated only by doing it, either as art or science." "Well, all right; so technique is important- perhaps crucial. Let's get back to you- I don't see too much what this has to do with the way one lives his life. Where do you fit in?"</page><page sequence="16">Our Seventh Decade 949 "I could quite easily be wrong- with Freud an accepted part of our culture these days one is never quite sure how much validity one's attitudes toward his past have- but I have always felt that my child- hood both made it necessary for me and prepared me to live a more experimental life- one in which thinking would have to play a rela- tively large part and tradition a relatively small one- that is, than a more 'normal' childhood would have. My past is marked, more than most I feel, by ambivalence and ambiguity, and I am left not only like the Baron in Nightwood 'the single, the embarrassed,' but with a heritage of conflict and insecurity on the one hand, and flexibility and resourcefulness on the other." "But just what do all these abstractions mean-" "Yes, I know. Patience. They mean that my parents were divorced when I was three years old, that I lived for a while with my mother, then with my grandmother (about six months apiece) and finally, for about fifteen years, with a guardian (about fifty years old when I came to her), completely separated from my parents, who, if I saw them at all, it was but for a few hours, once or twice a year. They mean, I come from a family that has been shattered by divorce for three generations- I not only have a stepmother and a stepfather, but step- grandmothers, step-great-aunts- in short a widespread family set-up, in which loyalties are difficult, if not impossible to trace. For example, Nana (my guardian) violently disliked my mother and my father and constantly depreciated them in my eyes; my mother, in turn, depreci- ated Nana when I was with her (my mother); my grandmother turned me against (or tried to) my grandfather and his wife; my stepmother seems to have been obviously jealous of any affection I got from my father- and so forth, down to aunts and uncles and cousins, all lined up on one side or the other of each of the many broken marriages. But you want concreteness: take, then, my relationship to my mother as a case history. Whenever I was with Nana (which was almost all the time) she would constantly tax me with a lack of 'appreciation' for what she had done for me, the 'sacrifices' she had made. 'When you go to your mother, I'll bet you don't stick up for me- I'll bet you just let her say terrible things about me,' she would say - and I would pro- test heartily, that I did appreciate her and I would stand up for her. But when I went to my mother, for a day's visit, and she did comment on Nana, I did not have the courage to say anything, and would thus feel guilty and confused as to whom I owed loyalty and love. This pattern repeated all throughout my family, and I was never able to cope with</page><page sequence="17">950 The Antioch Review the complex pattern of family loyalty with which I was faced. In my mother's case, it ended with the destruction of any particularly strong feeling between us, as between the usual parent and child. Our let- ters to each other now read like the chatty notes of suburban friends, or, now and then, like vain attempts to reconstruct a not very clearly understood relationship, which, if ever it existed, is now shattered for- ever." "Well, it is somewhat clearer- but did this 'ambiguity' as you call it- did it affect your life with your guardian, too?" "Yes, it was internal as well as external. In Nana's family, one entirely opposite to mine- a well-knit, German-type one, in which the lines of love and respect were clearly drawn and rigidly held, and divorce unheard of- I felt always half in and half out of the pattern. The tight loyalties they had toward each other would make me feel excluded and apart, but their honest attempt to include me made me feel closer to them than to my own family. But no matter how much they assured me I was 'one of them,' I never quite believed it in my heart, because their attitudes toward each other were so primary, so basic, and their attitudes toward me, so much more superficial. Fam- ily for them was too rooted in history and biology to really include an 'outsider,' but I clung to them nevertheless because my own family, if it could be called family, seemed even more shadowy, and my place in it completely undefined. In short, I felt quite marginal, and I suppose, to an extent, I still do." "That sounds painful." "I suppose it does, barely narrated. But it was really not as bad as it sounds. Even marginality is a matter of degree, and I did draw much sustenance from Nana and her family, she did, in a quite real way, care about me. I found a niche of a sort, even though it was not too good. True, I felt a kind of restlessness and insecurity all through grammar school and high school, a wish to get away, perhaps, from the too-complicated world in which I was forced to live into one where I could tell more easily whom I loved and who loved me, but I got along well enough. I lost the quest-for-certainty aim very early and learned to make my way through life as best I could- bracing up the rickety structure of my self as I went along, wherever it seemed most seriously to need it. As I went along, through high school, and here at college, I found many people whom I could, in one way or another, love, and who would love me, and though this stumbling along is at best a harried approach to living and conducive to strain, it is an ex-</page><page sequence="18">Our Seventh Decade 951 perimental one and has its advantages. So far it has worked quite well, and when I look around at some of my contemporaries who have had more usual backgrounds and are, in a sense, still fighting for just the elements of self-hood, I feel almost fortunate." "I don't quite follow you. I see the disadvantages in such a back- ground-but I don't understand just why you value it." "Well, perhaps I value it because I must, for, after all, it is the only past I have or am likely to get. But, I really do think it has benefited me in many ways- particularly, as I said, when I see so many of my friends restrained by traditional attitudes toward 'right and wrong' - toward 'responsibility,' 'family,' and the like, which I don't seem to have had. I had to work them out for myself, and they usually seem to work better than those some of my friends have inherited." "You mean it was easier for you to break with your family -to live your own life?" "Partially, yes. But it is not just the physical break that I mean. If we follow Dewey and say that creative thinking occurs only when neither habit nor fantasy will satisfactorily meet a problem, then we can say, I think, that the lack of definition of my early life led perhaps to a kind of premature maturity- a tendency to think rather than to rely on givens of the culture. After all, one cannot very well rely on traditional responses if one has not much of a tradition. I don't want you to misunderstand me; no one, no matter how much he may think so as a sophomore, escapes his culture- I didn't either. For better or for worse, I am a lower-middle-class American Jew with all that such an 'existence' implies; but I did, I feel, escape some of the more rigid patterns of behavior that cripple some people from their youth. "For example: Though I am a Jew, I was not brought up in a Jew- ish family or neighborhood but in a German one- and an anti-semitic one to boot. When I behaved badly, Nana would say things like 'it's the Jew in you coming out,' and equally distasteful things- or would attack my mother as a 'dirty Jew.' For most of my early life, I con- sequently did not know exactly how to behave toward my Jewish- ness- whether to feel ashamed of it (and, thus, hate myself) or ignore it, or wear it as a badge of distinction and martyrdom. In short, I had to think about what it meant to be a Jew in America. If I had been a gentile, I should, perhaps, have been merely anti-semitic like my 'parents.' Had I been a Jew in a more orthodox environment, I might have developed the uncritical rejection of the gentile world one finds in so many Jewish households (as in some of my relatives). As it was,</page><page sequence="19">952 The Antioch Review I think I got a deeper understanding of both Jews and gentiles than I would have got from merely 'conforming' to either tradition. I don't want to labor this, and perhaps I am being a little smug- I don't mean to be, and I don't regard myself as the only rational and emancipated person in the world, nor even wholly emancipated for I have my deep- seated prejudices, too; the only point I am tiying to make, is that while my rather confused early life certainly lodged in me many conflicts, ambivalences, and personal difficulties, it also left me relatively free to develop along lines that seemed good and profitable to me." "Well, I asked for concreteness and I guess I got it." "But, please don't leave too assured: you perhaps don't know as much about me as you think you do- I want to get Montaigne off the shelf and read you a passage from his essay on the inconsistency of our actions. Here it is . . . that great introspector, 'the wisest French- man who ever lived,' wrote: We are all creatures of patches, and so shapeless and strange in composition that each bit at every moment plays its own game. And there is as much difference between us and ourselves as between us and others. Not only does the wind of accident move me at will, but, besides, I move and disturb myself by the instability of my position; and anyone who observes carefully can hardly find himself twice in the same state. I give my soul now one face, now another, according to the direction in which I turn it. If I speak of myself in different ways, that is because I look at myself in different ways. All contradictions may be found in me by some twist and in some fashion. Bashful, insolent; chaste, lascivious; talkative, taciturn; tough, ignorant; and liberal and mi- serly and prodigal; all this I see in myself to some extent according to how I turn; and whoever studies himself really attentively finds in himself, yes, even in his judgment, this gyration and discord. I have nothing to say about myself absolutely, simply, and solidly, without confusion and without mixture, or in one word. Distinguo is the most universal member of my logic. . . . [Thus] it is not a matter for a calm mind to judge us simply by our outward actions; we must sound the inside and see what springs set us in motion. But since this is a high and hazardous undertaking, I wish fewer people would meddle with it. "So, when you write your article, remember that 'there is as much difference between us and ourselves as between us and others.' And though I, too, would rather be an expert on myself than on Cicero, I am afraid I do not quite qualify." Imaginary Interview- 4 "With all that talk last time," he said, "about technique, and method, you sounded almost like a leader of a 'group-group' or something.</page><page sequence="20">Our Seventh Decade 953 My feeling, particularly after what has gone on around here over the past year or two, has been that one of our big troubles, particularly in the social sciences, is an overconcern with method and technique, a kind of losing sight of the common-sense values of human living. As Kluckhohn said in that book of his, sociology has been called 'the sci- ence with the maximum of methods and the minimum of results' and that though many of us have often failed to see the forest for the trees, one sometimes wonders if sociologists recognize that such a thing as a tree exists." "Well, I don't disagree entirely. Someone else, Lynd I think, has said woe to the science whose methods develop faster than its prob- lems-because after a while its practitioners see no problems but those the methods already have answers for. Social psychology is a case in point; statistics grew so fast that after a while social psychologists seemed to think that all problems not susceptible to statistical han- dling were unreal. Method can certainly be blinding as well as reveal- ing and, further, an overconcern with its development can enable one to lose sight of human values and become but a highly trained hired hand of current power interests. Thus we find an appalling number of social 'engineers,' as they like to call themselves, engaged in working out systems of sophisticated paternalism in industry and theories of political technocracy in government. But, all this notwithstanding, I think there is a danger here of throwing out the baby with the bath. Methods, after all, are neutral; it is the use to which they are put and the interests they serve that determine their value. My feeling is that the social sciences provide both the greatest promise and the greatest threat to our future." "Go on." "Don't worry, I will. True, the manipulation of culture in the inter- est of restricted sections of our society can be as potentially danger- ous as placing the control of atomic energy in the hands of socially irresponsible men, as John Gillen has pointed out, in discussing the work now being done in industrial relations by anthropologists and psychologists. Unless 'applied social science' and, in fact, science in general, is done on a widely socialized basis and with due regard to human goals and objectives, it is not to be indiscriminately applauded. As Gillen says, the knowledge that has been gained about the ways of man in culture must be applied for the elimination of human suffering, and the fulfillment of human potentialities on a scale in which every man has his fair chance to participate: if it isn't, it were better to have</page><page sequence="21">954 The Antioch Review no science of man or culture at all. But this does not mean that such a science should be abandoned: knowledge of how human beings and their cultures operate is as necessary for self-protection from unscru- pulous thinkers as it is for improvement of undesirable conditions. It is theoretically as easy to plan and engineer a slave society as a free so- ciety-unless the prospective slaves know what is going on and how to prevent the fate that is being planned for them." "Well ... all right. But I'm still wary. You've hardly explained away the extreme positiviste among us and I imagine you must admit science has historically, at any rate, seemed pretty a-human, if not inhuman, at times. There seems to be almost an occupational disease that afflicts scientists, at least so it seems to most laymen, that gives them a narrow view of things, an inability to see outside their micro- scopes, a kind of 'trained incapacity' as Veblen would say." "I have been looking for a point at which to make a transition to the third 'way of life'- the aesthetic, and perhaps this is it. I can thus answer your question by indirection." "All right, go ahead." "To define it first along the same lines as we have the other two, we might say that in addition to regarding ideas as 'emblematic,' as the supernaturalists, or 'directive,' as the scientists, you may believe that ideas have significance in and of themselves, not in what they point to above and not in what they lead to below. You may admit that thoughts arise from a natural context and that they point to something other than themselves, and yet that you may hold their nature is in many ways of more consequence than their genesis or their function. Remember Auden writing on the death of Yeats:" You were silly like us: your gift survived it all; The parish of rich women, physical decay, Yourself; mad Ireland hurt you into poetry. Now Ireland has her madness and her weather still, For poetry makes nothing happen: it survives In the valley of its saying where executives Would never want to tamper; it flows south From ranches of isolation and the busy griefs, Raw towns that we believe and die in; it survives A way of happening, a mouth. "Good- but does this really fit with the scientific view?" "Well, it depends, I guess, on how you read the poem. In a sense it doesn't: art is undoubtedly 'useful' if we define useful broadly enough</page><page sequence="22">Our Seventh Decade 955 to include all that makes man less of a human animal and more of a human animal, and does, too, 'make something happen,' if only sanity and maturity. But still there is something to it, because, as you said, the scientific and the pragmatic mind has historically had difficulty dealing with the 'data' of both art and religion- in fact with most of the more complex phenomena of human cultural existence. And one of the main reasons, I think, is because it has refused to meet those phenomena on their own ground and their own right, refused to realize that: 'Things as they are, / Are changed when played upon the Blue Guitar.' "It has not, in short, been willing to see value in 'ideas' them- selves, such as myth, art, and the like- but has persisted in attempting to explain them in terms of something else." "You mean reductionism?" "In a word, yes- if, at the same time you realize that 'reduction' doesn't have to be 'down,' and that trying to deal with art as an excres- cence of God is as much a reduction as trying to explain it in terms of atoms. As Herbert Fiegl has said, that opposed to both the philosophy of 'nothing but' and that of 'something more' is the philosophy of 'what is what.' But to be less abstract: all I'm saying is that an appre- ciation of human purposes, human dreams, and human griefs on their own terms is necessary to anyone who wishes to be alive, and that, in addition to that everyday common existence that is at the basis of all we know or feel, art is one of the best places to find such human values and to get an appreciation of them. To get back to me, art, both the appreciation of it and the creation of it, have been crucial to my well- being all my life, and it is hard for me to over-emphasize their impor- tance for me. I almost always have had, and still do, a burning ambi- tion to be a fiction writer and a poet, beside which all the other desires I have seem meager. Of all the things I have so far accomplished, the things of which I am most proud (outside of my marriage, which is the best thing I ever did or am likely to do) are the poems and stories I have written, and I feel sure that no matter what I do in the future, the highest achievements to me, in personal terms, will still lie along these lines. Art helps me to understand my experience and to suffer it. With all my deep puzzlements and confusion, I have found more solu- tions and understandings in art than anywhere else and I have found more grains of strength there. Art is not escape, though it does have this propping quality, but rather a way of coming to terms with life, of assimilating it and feeling it more deeply and more surely. As Forster</page><page sequence="23">956 The Antioch Review has said, art as an escape is rightly discredited; it is both selfish and foolish to bury one's hand in the flowers, but herbs grow in the garden, too, and share in its magics, and from them is distilled the strength that we badly need today. In 'The Triple Fool,' Donne has said best what art means to the artist and to those who read him as artists:" I am two fools, I know For loving, and for saying so In whining poetry. But where's that wise man, that would not be I If she would not deny? Then as th'earth's inward narrow crooked lanes Do purge sea water's fretful salt away, I thought if I could draw my pains Through rhyme's vexation, I should them allay. Grief brought to numbers cannot be so fierce, For he tames it that fetters it in verse. But when I have done so, Some man his art and voice to show, Doth set and sing my pain; And, by delighting many, frees again Grief, which verse did restrain. To love and grief tribute of verse belongs, But not of such as pleases when 'tis read. Both are increasèd by such songs, For both their triumphs so are published, And I, which was two fools, do so grow three. Who are a little wise, the best fools be. "So art is a kind of stiffening for the business of life?" "Yes- but not only that; in another way, particularly for me, art acts as a corrective for science and abstract thinking, for intellectual- ism. The job of the artist might be said to be to bring symbols closer to experience- the poet tries to reverse the usual abstracting tenden- cies of words and to transcend usual schemes of experience to get at the real feeling of the event- so with the painter (for example: Miro and his wonderful childhood memories in bright colors and curious shapes)- so with the composer (witness Ives and his attempt to get at the real sounds of American culture). I, as many other intellectu- ally inclined (including almost all philosophers and all scientists these days), have a tendency to get too far away from what is really going on. Necessarily, I think, the concepts of modern science and modern philosophy widen the gap between themselves and experience in the</page><page sequence="24">Our Seventh Decade 957 interest of generality and predictive power, but if we are not to get lost in a maze of constructs and ultimately to take them for real, a con- tinual coming back to the colors, sounds, and patterns of the empiri- cal world is necessary. That is why someone like Klee is so good for us- because he pokes fun at what we often take too seriously with his twittering machines and the like and reminds us that if we get intel- lectual enough we can confuse ourselves right out of living. Even such a supposedly intellectual artist as Picasso is really teaching us to see differently, and thus to see better. This is another way to put the func- tion of the artist and to note his value as a corrective to other aspects of living: he teaches us to perceive better- to hear, to see, to feel the world around us in a new and revealing way. With such a constant renewal of vision there is little chance to get lost in abstractions, no matter how far we go along the uneasy roads of theory." "The function of the artist then is to revivify experience- yes?" "Yes. And he fixes such experience through time, so others can get something of it from their differing standpoints. Remember, 'beauty is momentary in the mind- / The fitful tracing of a portal / But in the flesh, it is immortal.'" "That's from 'Peter Quince at the Clavier,' isn't it?" "Yes, and to me, it has always seemed one of the most beautiful poems in the language, and a tremendous answer to those who say modern poetry is not as lovely as traditional- but we are getting off the track. We had better quit for this time. Next time, which as the division is ending will be the last, I want to try to pull all this together by tracing what I hope my future path will be, and why on the basis of my past and beliefs as I have, sketchily, outlined them, it seems a particularly profitable one for me." Imaginary Interview- 5 "I have scattered myself so far out that I don't quite know how to pull myself together," I said, "particularly in one interview. But unless this is going to be an interminable business between us, I had better try." "So far, you've said that one should live a life as an artist, a scien- tist, and a religious person." "No, I haven't. In the first place my 'three ways of life' were mere- ly generative principles, that is, a kind of framework on which to hang what I wanted to get said. Actually they are not necessarily separate</page><page sequence="25">958 The Antioch Review and distinct standpoints, but dissolved into one another, and I could have used many others just as well. As Kenneth Burke has said, what we must do is keep moving around experience so to speak, or keep turning it in the light to catch all the facets, and what you call the vari- ous positions you take in the process makes little difference, for you define them all in terms of each other anyway. Perhaps Arnold was wrong, if we are to see life whole, we can't possibly see it steadily. But that is the second point. I don't insist that this is the only way to live- just the way I feel I must, or wish to. Obviously there are people who, just as profitably, adopt one view of life and push it to the abyss: a process R. P. Blackmur calls the 'expense of greatness.' As he says, perhaps real greatness in a field entails such a sacrifice of breadth: without men like Freud or Mendel or Mondrian, who were willing to push a single view almost to the point of its own (and perhaps, their own) destruction, modern civilization would not have come so far. But while I respect such men and their tremendous achievements, such a way I feel is impossible for me. Partly because of my past, as I told you, partly because of my current attitudes (and partly because I was educated at Antioch College, and not M.I.T.), the prospect of spending the greater part of my life in a single, narrow pursuit, even after the truth, beauty or whatnot, seems repulsive to me. I want to go on as I have thus far, following each of my enthusiasms until the edge wears off, and then finding new ones." "Is such a thing possible?" "No, and besides, it can be carried too far. But I at least want to find a vocation that will allow me some flexibility, both intellectual and physical. I want to be able, at least for the first couple of decades out of school, to move around, both geographically and mentally. I want to get around the world, and I want to have experience in as many fields of endeavor as is possible. And of all the callings that seem promising along such lines, anthropology seems the most." "Well- it seems nebulous enough, anyway." "That is just, I suppose, but it doesn't have to be a nebulous field. At any rate, a field that has such an ill-defined tradition, and that has room for such diverse people as Robert Lynd, indistinguishable from a sociologist, on the one hand, Ernest Beaglehole and Erik Erikson, indistinguishable from psychiatrists on another, F. A. Montague and Harry Shapiro, practically anatomists or physiologists on still another, as well as archeologists like Kidder, paleontologists like Howells, lin- guists like the late Edwin Sapir, ethnographers like Radin, etc., ob vi-</page><page sequence="26">Our Seventh Decade 959 ously has room in it to move around a little. Of course I don't expect to be able to do all these things- but I will at least be able to draw on all such findings in what work I do, and coordinate many various lines of inquiry, as, for example, Cora DuBois did in her Alor studies, or the Henrys in their Pilaga Indian monographs. Speaking of the Henrys, the fact that my wife wants to do much the same sort of work makes it even more attractive. Dealing with non-literate cultures mainly (and to some extent with literate ones), I can find, I think, an outlet for all those aspects I defined above- the religious, the artistic, and the scientific- though the last is perhaps central. But then it was central above, too." "You're going to be another Margaret Mead, I gather?" "I guess I asked for that. But nevertheless, it is unjustified. I don't want to give the impression that I regard the social sciences merely as impressionistic approaches to whatever happens to interest the scien- tist at the moment- quite the contrary. I think the social sciences need a good deal more rigor than they now have, and I don't want you to think that I am incapable or unwilling to follow a line of endeavor to some kind of meaningful conclusion. All I hope for is to be able to do some significant work, which will be somewhat more interesting than spending my life engaged in tinkering with a corner porphyrin on the chlorophyll molecule. Again: not that such work is not important- just that I am, temperamentally and otherwise, rather unsuited for it." "You want to continue then this, well- hectic life?" "Yes, I suppose it is hectic . . . but it is interesting, too. I was, per- haps, born restless- perhaps I learned it- but no matter which, I most certainly have a commitment to uncertainty. I have, like anyone else, I guess, a drive for security, a drive that I imagine will become more important as I age, but I have, too, and at the moment at least it seems more important- an experimental drive- a drive to get out and see what is happening, to become involved ... to become confused and then struggle to dispel confusion. Dewey (I think) has said somewhere that life is like being lost in a forest one has never set foot in before, with no map, no sure compass . . . thus we go along, wandering among the trees, trying to figure out patterns and make tools to help us ... we sight first on one tree, or ridge ahead, and organize our actions to get there . . . and when we get there we sight another tree, another ridge, and begin the process again . . . but we never get out, for as Thurber quoting F. Hopkinson Smith has said, the claw of the old sea-puss gets us all in the end. Some people, high-minded people usually, say</page><page sequence="27">960 The Antioch Review this is a grub philosophy: that we should have stars to steer by, some 'grand and far-off point toward which all creation moves.' They say that people like me are 'materialists,' or 'positiviste' or 'hedonists' or other terrible things; they say we are opportunists because we have no general, absolute principles. But that is wrong- we do. We believe that the wandering in the woods is good, that it is what we were born to do, and that we should do it as best we can: that the process of liv- ing, not the end counts. We know too that there are other people wan- dering in the forest and that they are, most of them, just as confused as we and we are not ashamed of our ignorance and do not try to hide it with high-sounding theories about the ultimate nature of forest. We like to rest now and then, too, and gaze at the scenery, and in fact in moments we often feel we see more of the woods than at any other time- but we cannot stay anywhere permanently, for we have springs in us that will not let us sit still too long ... we are somehow always longing for a change of scene. So we are absolutists in a sense, but our absolutes are men-in-the-street. None of us came into this world of our own free will and most of us won't leave it that way either, but as Jose Villa says, 'have come, am here,' and we must make the best of it. I believe we were born only to live and nothing else- which is a kind of teleology, I guess, but at least a wholly human one- and that every man down at the core of him, even if that core is wholly hidden by the pains and disappointments of living in an uncompleted world, wants to live, and, given half a chance to, will grow the way he should. This is a faith then, one which Thomas Mann has beautifully portrayed in 'Mario and the Magican,' but which has received its most tremendous statement in the hands of a great Greek poet 2400 years ago:" Wonders are many, and none is more wonderful than man; the power that cross- es the white sea, driven by the stormy south- wind, making a path under surges that threaten to engulf him; and the Earth, the eldest of the gods, the immortal, unwearied, doth he wear, turning the soil with the offspring of horses, and the ploughs go to and fro from year to year. And the light hearted race of birds, and the tribes of savage beasts, and the sea- brood of the deep, the snares in the meshes of his woven toils, he leads captive, man excellent in wit. And he masters by his arts the beast whose lair is in the wilds, who roams the hills; he tames the horse of shaggy mane, he puts the yoke upon its neck, he tames the tireless mountain bull. And speech and wind-swift thought, and all the moods that mould a state, hath he taught himself; and how to flee the arrows of the frost, when it is hard lodging under the clear sky, and the arrows of the rushing rain; yea, he hath resource for all; without resource he meets nothing that must come; only against Death shall he call for aid in vain; but from the baffling maladies he hath devised escapes.</page><page sequence="28">Our Seventh Decade 961 II. Notes on Antioch I am going to be brief and to the point, as much as possible, not only because this section of the paper holds less interest for me than did the first, but because most of the criticisms of Antioch have been stated so often that there seems no need for you to hear them once again from me. Perhaps I'm wrong in my feeling that Senior Papers are largely ignored by officers of the college making policy, but, as I have heard, on numerous occasions, the same criticism from faculty members, it probably has some validity. At any rate, a feeling that your comments are doomed to spend the rest of their days in testing-office piles is not conducive to enthusiasm for this part of the paper, and such a feeling is held, I am convinced, by the great majority of graduating students. To start on a positive note, one that drowns out for me any and almost all discordants, I feel that the best thing about Antioch is the community and the people who make it up. As I said in the other part of this paper, I came from a home situation in which close and unvary- ing personal relationships seemed to be lacking and in which I had difficulty finding my place. Here, I have, almost for the first time in my life, felt an organic part of the group, have gotten some idea of who I was and what I was, and felt that I had formed some lasting and warm personal relationships. It is difficult to make clear to someone for whom Antioch is just another culture along the way, what it means to someone for whom it is almost the first, well-defined culture. I have, at any rate, drawn more personal strength from my years at Antioch than from any comparable period of my life, and no mat- ter how many criticisms I may have of various aspects of life here, I consider myself extremely fortunate to have come to a place like this which almost forced me to become more human, rather than a large university where my trend toward academic isolation might have con- tinued unchecked. As it is, I am happier than I have ever been in my life, and for that as well as the possibilities for future happiness, I am deeply indebted to both my friends and teachers here, and in general to the warmth, the flexibility, and the essential humanity of the Antioch community. The practicality of the Antioch ethos has been very good for me, too. Work in Community Government, on co-op jobs, the practical emphasis in classroom work, all have helped bring me and my theo- retically inclined mind more sharply up against the events of living.</page><page sequence="29">962 The Antioch Review This has been all to the good, for if I am anything too much, it is intel- lectual. For someone inclined the other way, it would perhaps be not too good because the theoretical is perhaps a little too lowly valued around here. The same thing is of course true of my first comment: al- though, coming from a disorganized background, I found the Antioch culture a well-organized one in which I felt more secure, I have heard the opposite claimed. Someone coming from a close family set-up in which the in-group was tightly knit might find the emphasis on self- reliance, initiative, and individualism here an anxiety producing busi- ness. But I can speak only for myself; and for me, both the free and yet warm life and the practical emphasis have been positive factors; factors that have, I am sure, changed sharply the course of my life. The next thing, is to be more specific about some of these factors. For example, participating in Community Government has proved, perhaps contrary to most people's experience, a quite rewarding busi- ness for me. True, in high school I had participated widely in student government, but the give-and-take, group-feeling I found here, was wholly lacking there, mainly, I suppose, because both student freedom and student responsibility was largely lacking. I am at present engaged in working out a reorganization plan for Community Government with some students (we have lately formed into a section of the Community Government research group), and I find such an experience an entirely worthwhile one. Not only am I learning how political theory is to be applied to specific situations but I am learning, without the aid of group dynamics, how to work with a group toward a common goal, and how to get such theory actually into practical acceptance and use. In general our recommendations have been along the lines of mak- ing the area boards more responsible, alleviating some of the pressure that now stymies Community Council, setting up an elective Judicial board, and streamlining the duties of the Community Manager. We hope to make a thorough study of these problems and make alterna- tive suggestions and then make recommendations to the community. As yet, it is impossible to see how far all this will get. We have laid out a timetable that includes such things as sending our report through hall presidents, calling meetings of students and faculty to discuss the report (one of these meetings has already been held, with some im- portant constructive criticisms gained), goals discussions, and finally, perhaps, a referendum. However, whether it succeeds or fails it will be one of the many Community Government experiences that have contributed to my personal growth.</page><page sequence="30">Our Seventh Decade 963 As for the Personnel Department, I will be as nice to them as ever I possibly can. Certainly, as poor as my jobs have been, I have learned something from them, if it is only to avoid the business world at all costs. However, I must make some criticisms, for the Personnel De- partment, from my experience, is generally inadequate: 1) There is a lack of counseling and excess of Placement. There is not nearly enough effort on the part of the Personnel Department counselors to act as counselors and help students absorb their job ex- perience and apply it to their own futures. 2) The Personnel Department seems to me at least, over-sensi- tive to criticism. I, and I think most students, realize quite well that whatever is wrong with the PD is largely the fault of factors other than the personnel. I have been continually impressed with the difficult situation under which most of the directors work, but if the Personnel Department is ever to become "better," a closer, more sympathetic hearing of student complaints, criticisms, and suggestions seems nec- essary. All of which leads to the following suggestion. It is virtually the only serious and constructive suggestion I am going to make, to which I feel rather committed. It is not a new idea, and perhaps not an alto- gether good one- but, before this paper gets consigned to the testing office files, I should like it seriously considered once more, for I feel it, or something like it, must be put into effect before the PD and the co-op plan will really work the way they should. It is simply this: I think that the placement functions and the counseling functions of PD should be separated. There should be a staff of people whose main duty it is to counsel and recommend students for jobs. There should be another staff of people whose job it is to get jobs, keep them open, es- tablish good employer-school relationships, see the student on his job etc. I realize this means a marked increase in the PD budget, but I feel that Antioch must either do it, or face the stern fact that it doesn't have resources enough to really make a co-op plan work. But one choice or the other must be made- half-a-loaf is not always better than none. If Antioch steers away, as the last goals discussion indicated it would, from expensive building programs and the like, then it can perhaps get money for the co-op plan. If real counseling could be set up in the PD, and more time could be given to getting good jobs, I think most of the criticisms would no longer apply.</page><page sequence="31">964 The Antioch Review I should go on now to the academic area of Antioch, for which most of my criticism is reserved. In the first place, I can name almost on the fingers of one hand the instructors I thought both adequate and inter- esting since I came, and who seemed to me wholly, or almost wholly excellent teachers. In order to be more specific, I shall name, in some sort of descending order, those teachers I hold in high regard: Mr. Carlson, Mr. Geiger, Mrs. Corey, Mr. Pillard, Heinz Eulau, and Mr. Eng. Mr. Carlson is by far, for my money, the best teacher in the col- lege. What he lacks in slick presentations (and he lacks almost all of it- he sort of thinks out loud in his classes) he more than makes up in penetration. He has a brilliant talent for clarification, and for introduc- ing odd perspectives on traditional subject matter. Mr. Geiger 's charms as a teacher are too well known to be set forth by me. His advantages are almost the rè verse of those of Mr. Carlson, making up for what he lacks (in class only, I think) in pen- etration with a sparkling classroom manner. His courses, particularly those at the first- and second-year levels (he tends to repeat in upper- class courses), are among the best in the school. Mrs. Corey is my advisor, and one of the warmest persons on campus; being able to talk to her from time to time has always seemed like a high value to me. Mr. Pillard thrilled me in his classes the first two years, not only with his own enthusiasm, but with his imaginative handling of the subject matter. Now, people tell me (I haven't had him as an upperclassman), he has taken a turn for the worse and people spend most of their time in his classes discussing what they are going to discuss. As for Heinz and Mr. Eng, both of whom I have this year for the first time, they seem genuinely interested in their work as teachers, and like the early Pillard, seem to be able to present their subject matter in an imagi- native and intelligent way without employing techniques in which it disappears. In some ways, the fact that two of the younger teachers are on my "good" list (and I might add George Dewey, whom I've never had in class, but worked with, to much profit, in CG) is encouraging. If the trend toward young, imaginative teachers continues, things may improve. Instead of listing the poor or mediocre teachers I have had (which would include almost all the rest), I will merely state some general reasons I have felt that with these few exceptions, teaching at Antioch is in the main inadequate: 1) An over-emphasis on teaching the lower-level courses. Because the average Antioch professor (it should be made clear somewhere in</page><page sequence="32">Our Seventh Decade 965 this section that I speak in the main of the non-natural-science areas, where most of my courses have been), seems to hold to the theory that freshman courses are more important than upper-class courses, there is a dearth of high-level, challenging instruction. Every course seems to "start all over from the beginning," and there is a feeling that teach- ing rigorous, demanding, technical upper-class courses in the humani- ties and social-sciences is somehow undemocratic. My feeling is that people in 300 courses should be expected to know the basic material in the field, and I get somewhat exasperated hearing the same elemen- tary material year after year; I think most students in the non-science fields find a definite sag in interest after their first two years and I think this the main reason. What the cure for it is, I do not quite know. An improved prerequisite system might help, but probably background cannot be adequately judged on the basis of previous courses taken. The only real way to meet the problem is for the teachers to have the intellectual integrity to teach 300 courses like 300 courses, 200 courses like 200 courses, and 100 courses like 100 courses, even if a few lazy students call them "slave drivers" outside of class and flunk once in a while. 2) The curious division system makes really intensive study al- most impossible. This is, of course, not the professors' fault, but I feel that most professors I have had spent too much time on mechanics, starting and stopping, etc. In general, they seem to use the time in a highly inefficient manner. 3) Most teachers in the humanities and social-science areas seem to feel that because it is not possible to isolate variables in the subject matter as adequately as in the natural sciences, and because that sub- ject matter is usually not so well defined, that they may say everything or anything that they happen to feel is true, without making any con- sistent attempt to see if their hypotheses are either verified or verifi- able. This is particularly true in literature courses, which are taught here either as history courses or appreciation courses, never at a very responsible critical level. Until people in the so-called "non-scientific" areas realize that their subject matter, too, has its demands, and that every comment about it is not as good as every other comment, and that what they say about it has not only to be non-contradictory, but must be significant and testable in some way, teaching in those areas will not much improve. Humanities and social sciences are attempts to inquire into the nature of the material included under them and to make value judgments therein, not excuses to reflect on the world at</page><page sequence="33">966 The Antioch Review large or initiate pleasant discussions about nothing much whatever. 4) There is at the present time, too much concern with method in Antioch classes. Though I think method crucial, I think it should come after the problem, not before it: that is, I believe in problem-cen- tered teaching, not means-centered. If a professor figures out (or, more likely, merely adopts) a teaching method, and then tries to apply it to class, it will surely fail. First he must analyze the class situation, and then he must devise a method. Heinz does this, and that is why his "innovations" succeed more often, than, say, Mr. Abrams', who does not. I am aware that I have been pretty hard on our poor faculty. They are probably (I have never been to another college) much superior to faculties elsewhere in colleges this size, and I do owe what intellectual advancement I have gained in the last four years to them. But as this paper is probably headed on direct line for the testing office, I wanted to make sure that what I had to say did not slip by unnoticed by you, one of the very few people who will ever read it. I am not as angry as I sound above; I have found Antioch intellectually stimulating and rewarding. If I had not, I would have left long ago. It is merely that I think there is still much room for improvement in almost all areas. I hope that under the new president, some of these improvements will take place.
