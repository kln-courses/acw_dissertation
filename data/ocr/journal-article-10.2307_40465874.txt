<plain_text><page sequence="1">228 Berichte und Kommentare Contemporary Stone Tool Technology A Review Article Anton Ploeg While the title of this study1 might suggest that its subject is the analysis by a group of archaeologists of a stone tool, with special emphasis on the material setting in which it is made and used, and while the authors themselves claim that they are addressing primarily archaeologists (16), the con- tent of their book is in fact far more wide-ranging. To start with, the Pétrequins include under the concept of ecology more than just the natural envi- ronment. Moreover, in several parts of Irian Jaya stone blades resembling axe or adze blades, but often not hafted, are used as wealth and/or ritual objects rather than as manual tools, and the authors discuss these artefacts also. Throughout the book, the authors present a rich profusion of high-quality photographs, drawings, and tables as an integral part of their argument. Justifiably they mention the makers of the drawings as collaborators on the title page. However, the quality of the maps does not match the excellence of the other plates. The book falls into three parts. The first is an introduction in which the authors set out their approach. In this part they also survey the dif- ferences between axes and adzes, their respective uses, the types of hafting and their geographical distribution. The production process of stone arte- facts, from quarrying to hafting, and their use is almost exclusively in the hands of males. They are part of the male world and indicative of the domination of men over women (81). The sec- ond part of the book contains descriptions of a number of sources of stone artefacts, mainly in the Central Highlands, and their manufacture and use. This is by far the longest part of the book. Most of the data presented were collected by the Pétrequins in a series of field trips, in the course of the 1980s. At that time, stone tools were still manufactured at six quarries and at all of them the authors could tap indigenous knowledge about the production process. Their photographs show 1 Pétrequin, Pierre, et Anne-Marie Pétrequin: Ecologie d'un outil. La hache de pierre en Irian Jaya (Indonésie).

New Guineans at work on quarrying, fashioning stones, and manufacturing axe and adze handles. None of the published photographs are posed. The third and final part of the book is an exercise in correlation, in which the authors attempt to relate the characteristics of the various stone artefacts to the cultural and physical environments in which they are used. Introduction The first part provides the context for the descrip- tions in part 2. It is a most promising start to the book. The authors start with a discussion of their theoretical approach. They explain the term "ecology" in the title of their book by stating that they analyse stone tools as if they were "liv- ing organisms in equilibrium with their biotope" (16). They add that this idea corresponds with the views of at least some of the New Guiñean users. However, to use as the central element of an analytical approach a notion that is shared by some of the people under study risks that researchers come to expect that element. Instead, their analytical approach should prompt them to explain and interpret it. Furthermore, I am not sure what the authors mean by "in equilibrium with their biotope." In all likelihood they acknowledge that in the course of time people often change the ways they use their artefacts, or that their demand for them may increase while their supply remains static. Such events may well upset a preexisting equilibrium, if that indeed obtained. Hence I prefer the approach advocated by Kopytoff (1986) who argues that it is fruitful to write "biographies" of artefacts. In the course of an artefact' s existence people may use it in different ways and they have "biographical expectations of things" (Kopytoff 1986: 67) which guide their judgements about how they are to be used in the consecutive phases of their existence. The approach seems useful to me also since the notion can be applied to both animate and inanimate entities, notwithstanding the reference to life in the term "biography." In this first part the authors also provide the geographical setting of their study. They stress that the inhabitants of New Guinea were open to influences from elsewhere (24 f.). This opinion seems to jar against the reasons which they give for the possibility to study by observation stone tool quarrying and stone tool use in Irian Jaya in the 1980s of this century, since they attribute this possibility to the late colonial penetration, the geographic isolation of the Highlands and cultural Anthropos 95.2000</page><page sequence="2">Berichte und Kommentare 229 barriers (13). New Guineans fashion stones for a variety of uses, to start with for use as axes or adzes. There are several types of each of these implements and various haftings. The Pétrequins conclude that axes are primarily used in western parts of New Guinea, influenced from further west, and adzes in the eastern parts, influenced from further east. Their use as axes and adzes imply that the stone blades have a central place in the reproduction of society. This is underscored by the fact that among many groups of New Guineans stone artefacts are part of life cycle and com- pensation payments, so are seen as suitable items to exchange for loss of life. Some use them in curing ceremonies (O'Brien 1969a: 38) and/or in ancestor worship or ancestor veneration. Hence they are also instrumental in social reproduction. By appropriating the manufacture and use of stone artefacts, men have secured themselves a crucial role in reproduction. Some regard the artefacts as detached from the "mother of axe blades," the qualification given to the rock from which they were taken. Some endow some categories of stone artefacts with su- pernatural powers (e.g., 274 f.). Hence, the ways in which people associate their artefacts with human life and life force differ. These differences matter analytically. The Sources of Stone Artefacts, Their Manufacture, and Use In the second part, the Pétrequins discuss a number of quarries, groups of quarries, and riverbeds from which stones were collected. They are located in various regions of New Guinea, both in the Highlands and the Lowlands. Although, at the time of writing, their discussion is not exhaustive, the sites described allow them to make an west-east comparison, from the Moni territories to the Papua New Guinea border, and from northeast to the south, from the Cyclops Mountains to the Asmat. Hence they compare regions, not merely ethnic groups, and this regional comparative approach appears to greatly benefit their analysis. They base their discussion in part on their fieldwork, and in part on examinations of stone artefacts, both in the field and in museums. The artefacts were reportedly from 32 localities. As far as the museum collections are concerned, the procedure seems risky to me: the artefacts were collected at different points of time, possibly several de- cades apart, with maybe different intentions, each resulting in a specific bias: to show the different primary materials, the different types of haftings, the different techniques of producing the blades, or for other reasons. Finally, the localities in which the artefacts were collected may have been inaccurately reported. Central Parts of the Highlands The authors first discuss a group of quarries at Yeleme, north of the habitat of the western Dani, in the forests fringing the Central Highlands (see map). With almost 100 pages, this is the book's longest discussion of a single group of quarries. It sets an admirable standard. The Pétrequins are able observers, with a keen eye for relevant detail and as they know how to put their observations into words, it is both a pleasure and a reward to go through their book. In the anthropological tradition made reputable by "Argonauts of the Western Pacific," they present their account as a travelogue. The Yeleme quarries belong to the Wano, a small group of about 2,000 people, whose first language is related to the Dani languages, but who are polylingual and whose culture is strongly syncretic also in other respects. Either they themselves, or members of other ethnic groups, especially Dani and Moni, have to travel several days through the forest to get to the quarries. They have to camp there for several days and obtain rough stones by heating a rock surface so it explodes. After preliminary fashioning, promising stones are taken back. Dani seem to lay a claim to the blades by stating that the Wano have made them by interring the bones of Sinok, a Dani cultural hero (138; Hayward 1997: 27). Briefly, the authors mention that preliminary results of archaeological dating suggest that the quarries have been worked for almost 3,000 years at least (92). The Yeleme quarries were visited by Harrer in the early 1960s, but his report (1964) is eth- nographically of very little value (cf. O'Brien 1969a: 44 n. 2). The contrary is the case with the discussion of the Pétrequins. The West Dani are the largest ethnic group in Irian Jaya. They are expanding geographically. Anthropological field research among them was initiated by Wirz in 1921 (Wirz 1924; Ploeg 1997), and after a long interval resumed by O'Brien and Ploeg in the early 1960s (O'Brien 1969a; Ploeg 1965, 1969, 1988). After the Indonesian government took over the administration of Irian Jaya, research was "brutally interrupted" (15). However, several missionaries have more recently written theses in anthropology based on their lengthy work among the Dani.

Finally, Bromley has continued publishing and writing papers dealing with primarily Grand Valley ethnography. Dani traditions maintain that they originated in the southeastern part of the Grand Valley (e.g., Bromley 1990). The archaeological research which could assess this claim has so far not been carried out. However, ethnographic research makes clear that the West Dani have in the past migrated westward, away from the Grand Valley. The Pétre- quins provide an excellent précis of what has been written about these migrations. The most suitable avenues to move out of the Grand Valley are the valley of the North Balim, which flows west to east until it bends to the southeast at the entrance of the Grand Valley, and the valley of the Ibele, a northwestern tributary of the Balim, to the south of the North Balim. From the North Balim, Dani have moved into the Toli Valley system and, further west, into that of the Yamo and the Ila. The Toli flows from southeast to northwest, into the Lakeplain. The Yamo first flows parallel to the North Balim, but in the reverse direction, from east to west, and then turns north to the Lakeplain. The three together form the main valley systems in the central parts of the Highlands. Hence, almost all the people living in these parts of the Highlands are now West Dani. In the late 1950s, when Euro- peans started settling in the area, the geographical boundary between the flat, wide Grand Valley and the narrow Y-shaped North Balim was also the linguistic boundary between Grand Valley Dani and West Dani. Whether that boundary was at the time in the process of shifting, or whether Grand Valley Dani culture, in its variety, was somehow geographically bound to the Grand Valley and its immediate surroundings, is not presently known. O'Brien (1969) and van Rhijn (1969) present information about movements of West Dani from the North Balim to the Toli and the Yamo. Larson (1986) has detailed information about their migra- tion further to the west, into the Ila Valley where they deplaced Damai. Part of these migrations are recent: van Rhijn writes that, in 1962, almost Anthropos 95.2000</page><page sequence="4">Berichte und Kommentare 23 1 half the population living in the Mulia Valley had been born in the Balim Valley area (1969:52). Larson gives a similar figure for llaga (1986: 15). Godschalk (pers. comm. 1997) reports a move northwards farther into the lower Toli Valley. However, migrations from the Grand Valley into the North Balim must have been less recent, or at least must have started at an earlier date, but the research to find out about their course has still to be carried out. The habitat of the Bokondini Dani among whom I carried out field research was in the north- east of the West Dani territories. I was told that their ancestors had moved into that area straight from the Grand Valley, from the south and via the Toli Valley from the west. The Wanggulam, among whom I carried out most of my work, had close ties with Dani in Panaga, an easterly tributary of the Toli, visited by Wirz in 1921. Northeast of Bokondini, and north of the Hablifuri, van Arcken met, on his way to the Grand Valley in 1939, people who may well have been West Dani (van Arcken 1941; see also Broekhuijse 1967: 16). They lived at an altitude of about 800 metres, in the lower ranges of what Hyndman and Morren call the mid-altitude fringe (1990: 16). However, most migrations of the Dani have so far been within the Highlands. And, except the Bokondini Dani, most have kept practising their intensive agriculture allowing relatively high population densities. As a result, the boundaries between Dani and others are often also boundaries between dense and sparse settlement. The Pétre- quins comment on this phenomenon with regard to the Yamo area (139, 351), but also the members of the expedition in which Wirz took part in 1921 suddenly came from the forest into a densely settled valley with extensive gardens and land un- der fallow (Lam 1929: 303 f.; Bijlmer 1922: 170). From Bokondini some Dani have moved further north, but most have maintained their residences in the Bokondini area. In this area, also, a sharp drop in population density occurs between Bokondini and the valleys further north (Ploeg 1995). There are no indications that the Dani had to displace earlier inhabitants when moving into the valleys north of Bokondini. The Pétrequins note that the migrations are still continuing (156). West Dani are moving close to Wano territories, with Wano moving away further north, in the direction of the Lakeplain. However, with the replacement of stone artefacts by steel ones and the discontinuation of their use as wealth items and ritual objects, there is less reason to take over the control of the quarries. The authors carry on their biography of the blades by relating how they are transported to the place where they will be further fashioned into proper tools, sharpened, and hafted. Generally the longer blades are retained by the people living closest to the quarries (170 f.). The expansion of the West Dani entails that in the central parts of the Irian Jaya Highlands there is an extensive area inhabited by people with cultures that strongly resemble each other, and speaking mutually in- telligible dialects. The existence of wideranging kinship networks among the West Dani is proba- bly also related to their recent migrations. These networks facilitate the rapid spread of stone blades among the Dani and beyond to the Moni and the Damai in the west and the Yali in the east (169). Moreover, people transport blades along the paths in the uninhabited mountain areas leading to Puncak Jaya and Mount Trikora, south and southwest of the Dani territories. Some exchange and/or trade routes include lengthy detours: while Heider reports that among the Dugum Dani in the eastern half of the Grand Valley stone artefacts are obtained from the Yali, their easterly neighbours (1970: 288), the Pétrequins maintain that the Yali have acquired them from West Dani (160). But most Dani use stone blades also for ex- change and/or ritual purposes. Among West Da- ni they are an important item of life cycle and compensation payments. Such blades are mostly larger than axe blades and they are mostly not sharpened. In the Grand Valley they are used for ritual purposes and in death payments. There, their number seems to be smaller than among many West Dani. Broekhuijse writes (1967: 145) that the bridewealth among the Wiligiman-Dani in the Grand Valley includes about 3-6 ye stones. Larson reports that "stone axe heads" form part of the wedding payments in llaga, but does not state their number (1986: 127 f.); O'Brien (1969b: 220) calculates mean figures ranging from 3.8 to 1.4 for the three wedding payments, while in Bokondini the number of stone blades appears to be much greater, although they live further away from the main quarries. On the basis of seven weddings I arrived at a figure of over 30 (1969: 30 f.). All these figures refer to the 1960s.2 As the Pétrequins note, exchange stones are anthropomorphic. Grand Valley Dani wrap many of them in what looks like female garments (204; Heider 1970: 289 f.; Broekhuijse 1967: 98 f.). Some 2 At that time the number of pigs seems to have been small compared with other Dani groups. Anthropos 95.2000</page><page sequence="5">232 Berichte und Kommentare West Dani divided them into male and female stones, with the male ones having a phallic shape. But they are also used in transactions making up for loss of human life: in bridewealth or death payments and in compensation for a person killed. The stones are accorded differential values both by Grand Valley and by West Dani (Heider 1970: 288; Ploeg 1965: 16, 60). During transactions they are laid out in a row, with the most valuable ones in the centre. In Bokondini these valuable stones were scarce. Once a man had acquired one out of the distribution of a payment, he tended to hold on to it to use it as the, necessary, centrepiece in, for example, the bridewealth for a daughter-in-law or the gift to his wife's father or wife's brother at the wedding of his daughter. I was told that such a precious stone might get lost when its holder died without revealing where it had been hidden. Like Heider (1970: 288), and in all likelihood due to my limited fluency in Lani, the West Dani language, I was unable to find out which features determined the value of the stones.3 The Pétrequins conclude that these types of stones have acquired three main purposes: barter, exchange, and religious purposes. They correlate these functions with the availability of the stones: barter in areas near the quarries, such as the Yamo where the stones are abundant; exchange in areas further away where there are fewer such stones; and still further away, where the stones are again scarcer, they are primarily religious artefacts. These conclusions would please cultural materialists, yet they do not explain for instance the male-female dichotomy, made by the Konda Valley, in the upper Toli (O'Brien 1969a: 408), and Bokondini Dani (Ploeg 1969: 10), but alien to the Mulia Dani (Hayward 1997: 127 n.l). Nor do they explain that the Mulia Dani use a small number of stones - but which ones? - also for exchange and for ritual (Hayward 1997: 112, 140). Among the Wano, the Pétrequins write, a man wears three to four axes in the course of his life. He is wise to own more than one, in case of a breakage, and anyway to use his axe carefully so as to prolong its life (134). The biography of blades differs greatly whether they are used for axes and adzes, for exchange or for ritual purposes. Stones used for axes and adzes tend to remain in the ownership of a single person, who may also be the one who has polished and hafted it. Their life is relatively short. In the Grand Valley the tool may represent a killed warrior and as such is kept in the men's house (p. 162 f.). Exchange stones change hands, often for a long period of time, and they accumulate in this way a history which enhances their value.4 Ritually used stones are stored away (e.g., Broekhuijse 1967: 115; Hayward 1997: 112) and so may also last a long time, as the property of an individual or a group.5 Eastern Highlands The Pétrequins continue their account of sources of stone blades with those in the eastern parts of the Highlands, in between the Grand Valley in the southwest and the Papua New Guinea border in the east. As they note, the area presents a different habitat, with rivers running in narrow valleys and gorges away from a central watershed, in an either northerly or southerly direction (also Bromley 1990:9). Landslides may be a regular occurrence (Michel 1983:45; Zöllner 1977:56; Godschalk 1993: 10). There are no large popula- tion concentrations, as in the Grand Valley and in the North Balim, nor ethnic groups as large as the Grand Valley Dani or the West Dani. Yet population pressure is high (220). The authors mention a number of "fertile pockets" and refer specifically to the intensive cultivation in one of them (263 and 278). They discuss three quarrying sites, from west to east, in the upper Sela Valley (263; Godschalk 1993: xvii-xviii); in Langda (219), in the upper catchment of the Heime and Mumyeme rivers; and in Suntamon, closer to the border with Papua New Guinea (278). They add to the previous discussions in several respects. First, it appears that quarrying at one of the sites is in the hands of specialists, while in Yeleme all men take part. These specialists employ a pecking technique in producing the blades, according to the Pétrequins a more exacting technique than flaking. A second addition to the discussion is the importance of riverbeds as sources of suitables stones. A third 3 In the course of my research I started taking part in the gift transactions of stones. Those I contributed invariably ended up at the end of the row of stones. 4 The Pétrequins mention such a buildup of value for stone blades quarried and exchanged in the Humboldt Bay area (331). 5 In 1991, one of the Yeneri quarries was visited by Hampton, a "life-time explorer" (Hampton 1992. Dr. G.N. Appell drew my attention to these publications). His reports add to the data collected by the Pétrequins since he approached the quarries from the Lakeplain rather than from the mountains. But although his visit postdates those of the Pétrequins, and although he was helped by one Wano man who also features prominently in the Pétrequins' reports, he does not refer to them or their research. Anthropos 95.2000</page><page sequence="6">Berichte und Kommentare 233 are the distribution networks. The areas over which the blades are exchanged or bartered vary greatly. The widest distribution reported occurs with blades from Suntamon. From there, blades reach the south coast and the middle Sepik. While the distribution network centring on Yeleme connects primarily highlanders, in the eastern Highlands there are more trade or exchange links leading away from the Highlands into the Lowlands. This brings the authors to touch briefly on the distribution networks for cowrie shells. They argue that cowries reach the Central Highlands via two routes, both from the south coast, one via the Paniai area in the southwest, and the other via the Muyu in the southeast. The point is intriguing, given the similarities in cultural outlook between the Ekagi-me and the Muyu, notwithstanding the great distance between these ethnic groups (Pospi- sil 1978: 118). Among both, cowries are the most important wealth item, which must hinder their diffusion to other parts of the Highlands. Among West Dani in the Toli and in Bokondini, in the central parts of the Highlands, they are indeed in short supply, and in high demand (Wirz 1932: 69). Lowlands The Pétrequins finish their discussion of stone artefact manufacture and use with two Lowland sites. The one is in the southern foothills where people searched for stones in the bed of the North West River. The discussion of this source is brief, necessarily so since the riverbed was no longer ex- ploited. This is disappointing since it had provided the Asmat carvers with some of their tools, so it would have been invaluable if the authors could have reported on the stone tools which the carvers favoured for their work, supposing this knowledge was still there. Far more substantial is the discussion of the Ormu-Wari quarries in the Cyclops Mountains, west of Jayapura. In this case again, the discussion includes pointed, well-illustrated descriptions of the production process and its social setting, which are a pleasure to read. The inhabitants of this area appear to have been far more intensively subjected to non-New Guiñean influences than the other peoples discussed in the book under review. To start with, there are Austronesian speakers among the inhabitants. Further, Swadling (1996: chap. 11) argues that southeast Asian traders contacted as early as 2,000 years ago in search of bird of paradise plumes. Finally, the area had been directly exposed to colonial influences for almost a centu- ry, much longer than the localities discussed so far. Glass beads and bracelets, still used as wealth items in the 1980s, are 19th-century Dutch prod- ucts. Nevertheless, as Galis writes (1955: 118 f.), the people believed in the 1950s that many or most of these objects are of local origin, just as the stone blades used for exchange are quarried locally. In the 1920s and '30s the imposing pagan cult houses had been either destroyed or been allowed to decay (Galis 1955: chap. 7) and the rituals carried out in and around them had to all appearances been discontinued. However, the quarry had been used up to 1980, especially to obtain blades for mar- riage exchanges, and blocks then collected were still fashioned when the authors carried out their research (308).6 The local societies were stratified. Only some clans had the right to work the quarries, as directed by the clan leaders. Fashioning of the blocks is in part in their hands. They also hold a stock of prized stone blades and make apparently well-considered gifts of such blades, in public, to allies, or persons they would like to be allies (336). That in the Hum- boldt Bay area people use locally derived objects as prized wealth contrasts with what happened in the Bird's Head, another area in Irian Jaya which underwent non-New Guiñean influences. There people elevated imported objects such as vases and pieces of cloth to the status of wealth items. The use of stone blades as wealth items and markers of status in Humboldt Bay is a reminder of similar practices in inland Telefomin (Jorgensen 1990: 156 f.), much less subjected, however, to direct non-New Guiñean influences. Correlations The concluding part of the book consists of a long series of correlations. Modestly, the authors call it a "rapid synthesis" (349) of their Irian Jaya data which, they admit, are not complete in that they do not cover all the sources of blades and which, moreover, concern a political rather than an anthropological unit. They have started using their Irian Jaya data to aid prehistoric research studies elsewhere in the world. P. Pétrequin, C. Jeunesse, et al. (1995) present the results such a project carried out in southeastern France. 6 I am predisposed to find this remarkable since among the West Dani such exchange stones were among the items the people discarded when they en masse converted to Christianity. Anthropos 95.2000</page><page sequence="7">234 Berichte und Kommentare The elements for the synthesis are set out in a two-page table (352 f.) with the features of the artefacts and their setting in the rows and the ways in which they occur in the 15 localities discussed arranged by column. As the authors point out (395), they give most attention to the technical aspects of the production of blades and their use: among them the amount of suitable stone at the quarries, the distance to the quarries from settlements, the techniques used to produce usable blades, and the size and shape of the blades. Such an analytical procedure seems most fruitful with regard to these technical aspects. The authors favour it from their comparative perspective which prompts them to look for determinisms because these are of general applicability. It is much harder to characterise cross-culturally the various mani- festations of the social aspects of blade production and use. For instance, the exceptional qualities of Grand Valley agriculture are not singled out in the system of differentiations which the authors have devised. Intensity of warfare they measure by the amount of time spent on it. The measure seems debatable, moreover the data necessary to apply the measure are scant. Although my own research in Bokondini focused on this aspect of culture, I do not know the amount of time people there spent on fighting. And the significance which people attach to the blades remain underexposed. Notwithstanding their concern to identify gen- eral trends in production and use, the authors make several arresting statements on the social and cul- tural settings which they encountered in Irian Jaya. One is that the technical use of the stone blades remained dominant, since blades used for ritual and exchange were worn ones or those technical- ly or culturally unsuitable as cutting instruments (394). Several comments can be made here: like objects used for exchange, technical tools also can accumulate a history since they may remind of the person who has used and worn it; among the Dani many stones to be used for exchange are deliberately quarried and fashioned into blades, so they represent a considerable labour investment; and the statement seems to contradict an earlier one to the effect that technical reproduction gives way to social reproduction (392), while it is in the latter that the exchange and ritual stones play their part. Another such comment refers to the types of objects which serve as wealth items in the different societies discussed, viz. pigs in the central and western parts of the Highlands, as against plumes and weapons in the eastern ones, a division paralleled by the types of stones used and the types of their hafting. But everywhere, the Pétrequins argue, the wealth items par excellence are shells. The value of such statements is that they serve as pointers for research. The book is studded with such statements which I see as one of its prime qualities. In addition, it is a gold mine of information and it reads well. An English translation would be most desirable.
