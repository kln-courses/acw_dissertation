Walilko, Anita Malhotra, Yonghua Zhu, and Albert I. King Bioengineering Center Wayne State Univ. ABSTRACT Twelve side impact sled tests were performed using a horizontally accelerated sled and a Heidelberg-type seat fixture. In these tests the subject's whole body impacted a sidewall with one of three surface conditions: 1) a flat, rigid side wall, 2) a side wall with a 6" pelvic offset, or 3) a flat, padded side wall. This series of runs provided a good test of how injury criteria perform under a variety of impact surface conditions. In this study thoracic injury criteria based on force, acceleration, compression, and velocity X compression (VC) were evaluated. Maximum compression and VCmax proved to be the best injury indicators in this series. Biomechanical response and injury tolerance are also presented. INTRODUCTION Side impact is a most serious automotive injury problem, second only to frontal impact in terms of injury and fatality in the United States. Each year, about 8,000 automobile occupants are killed and thousands more injured due to side impact. In a recent review of fatality data by Viano et al (1989a), it was found that 31.8% of passenger car fatalities occur in crashes with the principal direction of force lateral to the vehicle. Of those, 2/3 of the fatalities are due to multi-vehicle crashes and the remainder involved the impact of a single vehicle with a fixed object. Multi-vehicle crashes freguently involve the older victim, over the age of 40. When side and frontal impact fatalities are compared, the age of the occupant emerges as an important factor in side impacts. Multi-vehicle side impacts represent about half of the fatalities in the age group over 40. Despite the gravity of the situation, the biomechanics community has not accepted a universal injury criterion for the thorax and the abdomen. More data is reguired to define the response of the torso to side impact in the sense that regional impact data need to be verified by whole-body sled tests. That is, the distribution of load to various regions of the torso can only be determined by a whole-body test in which loads encountered by each region are measured simultaneously. There have been relatively few cadaveric sled tests which include impact forces as part of the measured response and none in which film analysis was used to evaluate compression and the viscous criterion of Viano and Lau (1985) . Eppinger et al (1984) reported on eleven tests which include thorax and pelvic forces run at the University of Heidelberg. The tests we have run under the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) grant are the first sled tests in which shoulder, thoracic, abdominal and pelvic forces are measured and high speed film data is used to analyze the event. METHODS The surrogates used in the lateral impact tests were unembalmed human cadavers donated to the University under the Willed Body Program. The cadavers were used shortly after rigor mortis had passed. The subjects were positioned on a Heidelberg-type seat fixture (illustrated in Marcus et al, 1983) which in turn was mounted to a horizontally accelerated sled. The sled was accelerated up to velocities of 6.7 1678</page><page sequence="2">to 10.5 m/s and then rapidly decelerated so that the cadavers would continue to translate laterally on a teflon seat into the wall of the seat fixture. The cadaver was instrumented with accelerometers and pressure transducers to record the kinetics and kinematics of impact. The impact side wall was instrumented with nine load cells to record impact forces (Fig. 1) . CADAVER PREPARATION AND INSTRUMENT- ATION The cadavers had pretest x-rays taken of all skeletal structures as well as abdominal and chest x-rays in order to determine existing skeletal and soft tissue anomalies. The cadavers were instrumented with accelerometers on the vertex of the skull in the 3-2-2-2 conf- iguration described by Padgaoankar et al (1975). The twelve accelerometer thora- cic array as developed by Robbins et al (1976) and by Eppinger et al (1978) was used to instrument the ribs, sternum, and thoracic vertebrae. The sacrum was instrumented with a triaxial accelerome- ter. Phototargets were mounted at upper and lower sternum, Tl, T5, T12, sacrum, right iliac crest, right fourth rib, right eighth rib, right shoulder joint, left calvicie, and left scapula. This array of targets can be used to measure trunk deformation, rib cage rotation, and the trajectory of the shoulder during impact. The vascular system of the cadaver was repressurized in the thorax and abdomen with four balloon catheters fed through the carotid arteries and jugular veins into the thorax. Arterial pressure was measured with a pressure transducer fed from a carotid artery into the thoracic aorta. Placement was verified by x-ray. The femoral arteries and veins were tied off. Just before testing, a solution of India ink and normal saline was pumped into the vascular system from a pressurized tank. The arterial system was pressurized to 100 mm Hg, and the venous system to 50 mm Hg. The pressure tranducer monitored pre-impact and impact arterial pressure. A tracheotomy was performed to permit access to the lungs, which were aerated five to seven times just before impact and left unpressurized. SLED PREPARATION AND INSTRUMENTA- TION - The sled used was the horizontally accelerated WHAM III. The sled measures 2.0 m wide by 3.66 m long and is accelerated on a 40 m track. The system has a pneumatic propulsion device with a 22 m long acceleration stroke. At the end of this stroke the sled is disengaged from the propulsion mechanism and allowed to strike a hydraulic snubber. Snubber stroke was set at 0.203 m (8"). The sled was instrumented to measure sled acceleration and velocity. NOTE: ALL DIMENSIONS IN mm. Figure 1.

In order to achieve a lateral impact where the subject approaches the impacting wall at a predetermined velocity, the subject was positioned parallel to and approximately 1/2 meter from the wall, with the left side (the struck side) , facing the instrumented side wall. It sat against the two-bar seat back. In all tests the arms were positioned slightly anterior to the mid-axillary line by tieing the arms together at the wrists with duct- tape and letting the arms rest on the lap. The left arm was part of the impact . AUTOPSY - Post-impact x-rays were taken of the abdomen and thorax and all skeletal structures. A detailed autopsy was carried out by a board certified pathologist. The autopsy covered all regions of the body but special attention was focused on thoracic, abdominal and pelvic injuries. Cadavers were handled with the infection control precautions we have developed as an extension of Centers for Disease Control guidelines (Cavanaugh and King, 1990) . DATA PROCESSING - Analog data was filtered at 1000 Hz (SAE class) , digitized at 8000 Hz and uploaded to a Multiflow mainframe for further data processing. FILM ANALYSIS - Two dimensional film analysis was used in SIC 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 10, 11 and 12 by tracking the spine target at the T5 level. This was used to measure half -thorax width before and during impact to obtain thoracic compression of the half width. These data used a rear view camera at approximately 1000 frames per second. In SIC 08 and 09 rear view film was not available, so compression of the thoracic half width was based on tracking upper and lower sternum targets in the front view film (500 fps) . Compression time history data data thus obtained [C(t)] were used to compute maximum compression (Cmax) and multiplied by sled impact velocity (Vmax) to obtain Vmax x Cmax. Def- lection-time histories were filtered and differentiated to obtain V(t) and multiplied by C(t) to obtain VCmax. Front and rear view film for 2-D film analysis of the 9 m/s pelvic offset tests (SIC 01, 02) are not available, but oblique camera views are available for future 3-D analysis. In the padded-wall tests (SIC09- 12), thoracic deflection was tracked by following 25 mm targets attached to hollow metal rods which were attached to the struck face of the padding with a samll metal plate (Fig. 2) . In SIC 11 the rod broke free from the padding, so peak compression was estimated by measuring the deformation of the crushed pad after impact.

The side-wall force data were digitally filtered with a 300 Hz Butterworth filter (BWF) for injury evaluation. The acceleration data were digitally filtered at 180 Hz (SAE) , digitially subsampled at 1600 samples per second and 100 Hz FIR filtered per the procedure outlined by Morgan et al (1986). The side-wall force data were processed the same way for the development of force-time corridors (see Appendix) . The data were normalized using the equal stress-equal velocity scaling procedure outlined by Eppinger (1984) . Lamda , the basic scaling factor used in this method is shown in Table 1 above. FORCES - The force-time histories at each of the four anatomical levels (shoulder, thorax, abdomen, and pelvis) are computed by summing the load cell responses of the two load cells at that level (Fig. 1) . The maximum forces at the four levels vary from test to test and level to level, but, overall, increase with increasing subject mass and subject velocity, in Table 2 are listed the peak accelerations and in Table 3 the peak force responses at the thorax. The force responses include the thoracic beam forces and the sum of shoulder + thoracic, and shoulder + thoracic + abdominal beam forces. The shoulder beam incorporates the upper ribs of a typical test subject; the thoracic beam the middle ribs; and the abdominal beam, the lower ribs. The shoulder plus thoracic beam incorporate the same area as the thoracic force plate of the Heidelberg tests. The addition of all three beams covers an area that appoximates the hard thorax described by Eppinger et al (1982). The average force-time responses for the unpadded tests (+/- one standard deviation) are presented as corridors in the Appendix. Rise times to first peak force were generally 7 to 10 ms, and impact duration 55 to 60 ms in the 9 m/s unpadded wall impacts and 67 to 95 ms in the unpadded 6.7 m/s impacts. The unloading portions of the 6.7 m/s force- time curves are quite extended in some cases because of the slow rebound of the cadaver off of the barrier. Thoracic beam The peak thoracic forces (normalized, 300 Hz BWF) averaged 3.96 kN in the 9 m/s pelvic offset tests, 3.42 kN in the 9 m/s flush wall tests and 2.39 kN in the 6.7 m/s flush wall tests. Peak thoracic force was 4.03 kN in the 8.7 m/s ARSAN padding test (SIC 09) . With 15 psi cardboard honeycomb padding the thoracic forces in 9 m/s tests were reduced to 2.86 kN (SIC 10) and 3.15 kN (SIC 11). With 23 psi cardboard honeyconťb, thoracic beam force was 4.28 kN (SIC 12). Shoulder plus thoracic beam: If the shoulder beam is combined with the thoracic beam the area covered is the 1681</page><page sequence="5">same as the thoracic plate in the Heidelberg sled tests. The peak shoulder plus thoracic forces (normalized, 300 Hz BWF) averaged 7.08 kN in the 9 m/s pelvic offset tests, 8.36 kN in the 9 m/s flush wall tests and 5.66 kN in the 6.7 m/s flush wall tests. These peaks are less than the corresponding peaks in the Heidelberg tests as represented by the International Standards Organization (ISO, 1988) corridors for 8.9 and 6.7 m/s sled tests. This is probably due to the greater difference in velocity between the cadaver and barrier in the Heidelberg tests compared to our tests: approximatley 10.3 m/s for the 8.9 m/s sled velocity and 13 m/s for the 11.2 m/s sled as described by Marcus et al. (1983) . This increased delta V was due to rebounding of the sled into the direction of the cadaver during impact. WSU forces are also probably less because in these tests there is an abdominal beam 9 mm below the thoracic beam. In the Heidelberg tests there was a 90 mm gap below the thoracic force plate, which would result in inertial forces in the abdomen being partially picked up by the thoracic force plate.

With 15 psi cardboard padding these forces were reduced to 5.80 kN (SIC 10) and 5.98 kN (SIC 11). In SIC 12 , with 31 psi padding at the shoulder and 23 psi at the thorax the peak force was 8.79 kN. Thus 15 psi cardboard padding in 8.7-8.9 m/s impacts (SIC 10, 11) reduced peak normalized thoracic + shoulder beam forces (5.89 kN avg.) to almost that of the 6.7 m/s rigid wall tests (5.66 kN avg.) . Hard thorax; When the forces at the shoulder, thorax, and abdominal beams are added together, the impacted area is approximately that of the hard thorax, defined by Eppinger et al (1982) . The hard thorax includes upper abdominal organs that lie within the rib cage, including the liver and spleen. As seen in the normalized data of the Appendix, the responses between tests closely match each other for tests with the same impact parameters. COMPRESSION - The compression is defined here as the compression (in cm) of the struck side half-thorax (measured at the T5 level) divided by one-half of the chest width (in cm) x 100. The half chest width was measured from the T5 level at the spine to the outside surface of the left (struck) arm at that level, since the arm was part of these impacts. These peak compression data are summarized in Table 4, and ranged from 21 to 65%. Vmax x Cmax and VCmax are also listed.

In 1980, severe flail chest was assigned AIS 4, while in the 1985 guide, severe flail chest requiring respiratory support is assigned AIS 5. In three tests (SIC 01, 02, and 09) severe flail chest resulted in MAIS 5. AIS was assigned to rib fractures as follows: 1 rib, AIS 1; 2-3 ribs, AIS 2; &gt;4 ribs, AIS 3; flail (unstable chest wall), AIS 4; severe flail chest, usually requiring respiratory support, AIS 5. A flail chest is an unstable chest wall in which a portion of the rib cage does not rise on inspiration because of loss of structural rib cage integrity. In a cadaveric specimen this is difficult to evaluate, but nine or more rib fractures to a hemithorax was considered flail chest and assigned AIS 4, as per Viano et al (1989b) . In our test series twenty or more rib fractures to a hemithorax was considered severe flail chest requiring respiratory support and assigned AIS 5. The right side and left side of the rib cage were each assigned their own AIS for rib fractures. Generally, more rib fractures occurred on the left (struck) hemi-thorax. The first, second and third highest AIS to the thorax are shown in Table 5. Maximum AIS (MAIS) ranged from 2 to 5, with MAIS 2 occurring in two cardboard padding tests, MAIS 4 in four unpadded flush wall tests, and MAIS 5 in six tests (three pelvic offset, one flush wall without padding, and two flush wall with padding) . More thoracic injury occurred in the 9 m/s pelvic offset tests (MAIS 5 for SIC 01, 02) than in the 9 m/s flush wall tests (MAIS 4 for SIC 04, 06). The subject age was very similar in these tests (range 60-69 years) . The 9 m/s pelvic offset tests resulted in internal organ injury while the 9 m/s flush wall tests did not (see Table 5) . Normalizing AIS for age using AIS - 0 . 025 (Age-45) as suggested by Marcus et al (1983), the WSU 9 m/s pelvic offset tests had an average maximum age-normalized AIS of 4.49, and the 9 m/s flush wall tests 3.51, again showing that the 0.15 m pelvic offset produced more thoracic injury. 1683</page><page sequence="7">Aortic tears occurred in five tests; SIC 02, 03, 08, 09 and 12. SIC 02 sustained a tear of the intima, the innermost layer of the aortic wall (AIS 4) . In the other four tests the tear transected all layers (AIS 5) . In SIC 08 the impact velocity was only 6.7 m/s but the tear occurred at an area of extensive athersclerosis. SIC 09 and 12 were padded wall tests with relatively stiff padding in elderly female subjects. In all tests, the tear occurred at the upper end of the descending thoracic aorta, near the ligamentum arteriosum, the ligamentous attachment between the aorta and the pulmonary artery (Fig. 3). The descending thoracic aorta is firmly anchored in paravertebral fascia. Thus, the inertial forces created by the laterally accelerating heart and great vessels may pull on the firmly entrenched thoracic aorta, causing aortic tears near the aortic arch- thoracic aorta junction. In the unpadded flush wall 8.9 m/s tests performed at Heidelberg the average maximum age-normalized AIS was 3.42 (Marcus et al, 1983), with an actual delta V between subject and wall of 10.5 m/s. In the two WSU 9 m/s flush wall tests, the maximum age normalized AIS averaged 3.51. Perhaps the Heidelberg tests averaged slightly lower AIS with a higher delta V because of the subject's arm position. In the WSU tests the arm was slightly anterior to the mid-axillary line (with wrists tied at the lap) , while at Heidelberg the arm appeared to be at the side (Fig. 1 of Kallieris et al, 1981) . A.

Biomechanical responses considered were: peak force, acceleration, compression, velocity and combinations thereof occurring to the thorax and hard thorax. Injuries considered were: total rib fractures, left side rib fractures, MAIS, and age corrected MAIS. Table 6 summarizes the results of the least squares analysis and Table 7 the Logist analysis. ACCELERATION AND FORCE CRITERIA - Table 8 lists normalized acceleration combinations which were explored as injury criteria. The most promising single acceleration injury predictor in this analysis was the peak upper sternum x-acceleration (r = 0.54 to 0.56), which is in the antero-posterior direction of the thorax. The best force criteria was peak force of the thoracic beam. The peak left rib acceleration had correlation coefficients close to those using the peak thoracic beam forces. TTI , the Thoracic Trauma Index (Morgan et al, 1986), resulted in somewhat less correlation to injury. TTI is defined as 1.4 X AGE + 0 . 5 (RIBY + T12Y)MASS/Mstd In our tables, the Thoracic Trauma Index utilizing the greater of peak left fourth or left eighth rib accelerations is termed "TTI." In Morgan et al (1986), it was proposed that in cadaveric tests, the maximum of either upper rib after normalizing by 1.3 x upper rib - 2.02, or lower rib be used in the formulation of TTI. We have termed this "Modified TTI " in the tables. The combination of two orthogonal accelerations was also studied. The best results occurred with the vector sum of peak upper sternum-x and T12-y accelerations (r=0.57 to 0.62) and upper sternum-x plus Tl-y (r=0.45 to 0.65). The peaks of the two accelerations did not necessarily occur at the same point in time. COMPRESSION AND VELOCITY CRITERTIA- Compression and velocity x compression performed better than force and acceleration as injury criteria according to the linear regression results of Table 6. Compression of the half chest width at the T5 level correlated well rib fractures (r=0.59- 0.68) and with age normalized MAIS (r=0.90). Vmax x Cmax correlated well with injury (r=0 . 54-0 . 84) . VCmax also correlated well with injury (r=0.66- 0.89) . Since these compressions use the half chest width and include that portion of the arm at the impact interface, the results cannot be compared directly with compressions obtained via pendelum impacts to swine and human cadavers. Nevertheless, the results indicate that compression and velocity x compression correlate well with injury under entirely different test conditions than the pendelum tests, and lend support to their use as injury predictors in the side impact environment. Figures 4a-h are Logist plots of thoracic force, TTI, upper sternum-x, Cmax, VmaxCmax and VCmax versus MAIS. These data were used in the Logist analysis of probability MAIS :v 4 as a function of the peak value of the particular biomechanical response. The Logist results are summarized in Table 7. These data show that peak compression and VCmax performed well as injury risk indicators. The best acceleration-based criterion was the square root of the sum of the squares of peak upper sternum-x and Tl-y accelerations. This did not perform as well as compression or velocity x compression. The values of the injury risk functions at 25% probability of MAIS 4 or greater are as follows: TTI, 133.2 g; modified TTI, 132.7 g; upper sternum-x, 27.7 g; vector sum of upper sternum-x + Tl-y, 66.9 g; Cmax, 31%; VmaxCmax, 2.46 m/s; and VCmax 0.72 m/s. Compression performed almost as well as VCmax as an injury predictor in pendelum impacts to the thorax of human cadavers (Viano et al, 1989b) . In the evaluation of thoracic trauma due to blunt frontal impact in swine (Kroell et al, 1986) compression, Vmax x Cmax, and VCmax were related to injury, with VCmax and Vmax x Cmax performing better than compression. 1685</page><page sequence="9">TABLE 6: LEAST SQUARES ANALYSIS OF INJURY CRITERIA IN SIDE IMPACT LEVEL LEVEL BIOMECHANICAL INJURY OF BIOMECHANICAL INJURY OF RESPONSE RESPONSE N r SIGNIF RESPONSE RESPONSE N r SIGNIF.

In SIC 09 a three inch thick, 0.9 lb/ft3 density resilient closed cell foam was used (ARSAN, trademark ARCO Chemical) . The test resulted in two AIS 5 injuries to the thorax: a lacerated aorta and severe flail chest. In SIC 10-12 open cell cardboard honeycomb padding was used. In SIC 10 the padding was 6" thick and rated at 15 psi compressive strength. In SIC 11 the padding was 4" thick, and rated at 15 psi at the thoracic and abdominal beams and 23 psi at shoulder and pelvic beams. MAIS was 2 in both tests. In SIC 12 the padding was 4" thick, and rated at 23 psi at the thorax and abdominal beams, and 31 psi at the shoulder and pelvic beams. MAIS was 5 due to a lacerated aorta. The ARSAN padding may have performed poorly for two reasons: it appeared to be too stiff for human tolerance and it did not dissipate energy well. Above 1.25" of compression, the compressive strength exceeded 20 psi, which may be too high for the lateral chest wall of human subjects in side impact, (ie, in SIC 12 23 psi padding was too stiff) . The ARSAN and many other closed cell foams stiffen and store energy as they are compressed. In resilient padding, much of this energy appears to be released into the subject when the padding rebounds. Also, a stiff pad may prolong impact compared to a rigid wall, thus increasing compression and injury severity (personal communication with Ian Lau of General Motors) . The 15 psi compressive strength cardboard honeycomb was well tolerated by the human thorax and abdomen. In SIC 10, 15 psi padding was used at shoulder, thorax, abdomen and pelvic levels, and the depth (6") was made sufficient to absorb much of the kinetic energy of impact. The padding dissipated energy well (there was little cadaver rebound) and MAIS was 2. In SIC 11, the padding depth was reduced to 4" with the substitution of stiffer padding (23 psi) at stiffer anatomical areas (shoulder and pelvis) , providing more energy dissipation per unit volume. With this configuration, injury was again minimal (MAIS 2). In SIC 12, 4" thick padding of increased stiffness was used to determine if higher compressive strengths would be tolerated by the human thorax, with the aim at reducing the depth of padding to 3" in future runs. 31 psi padding was used at shoulder and pelvis and 23 psi at thorax and abdomen. MAIS was 5 (aortic laceration) . Flail chest also occurred (AIS 4) . The subject was a 54 kg, 68 year old female. Deflection of the padding in the thoracic and abdominal levels was less than two inches , indicating that 23 psi was too stiff for the older subject's thorax.

The thorax tolerated 15 psi padding in two tests (SIC 10,11), but not 23 psi in a third test (SIC 12) . If padding of different stiffnesses were used in door panel design, care would have to be taken so that a stiff shoulder pad would not extend into the thoracic areas, where it appears padding of much less stiffness can be tolerated. Because of anatomical variation in shoulder heights, using a stiffer shoulder padding may not be possible if it would impinge on the thoracic area of taller subjects. The compressive strengths listed for the honeycomb cardboard are those of the manufacturer (International Honeycomb) . Actual compressive strengths in the side impact tests are approximately 20% less because of loading of the edges of the cardboard. CONCLUSIONS 1. The 0.15 m pelvic offset in an unpadded barrier did not reduce thoracic injury. 2. Peak T5 level compression and VCmax at the T5 level performed well as injury predictors . 2 . The square root of the sum of the squares of peak upper sternum-x and Tl-y accelerations performed well as an injury risk function. Other acceleration and force-based injury criteria did not perform as well nor as well as compression and velocity based criteria. 3. In five of twelve tests, tears of the thoracic aorta occurred near the top of the descending thoracic aorta, which may act as a point of restraint as the aortic arch and heart try to pull away while accelerating laterally. 4. Open cell padding appears to be well tolerated at the following strengths in the side impact environment: 12-15 psi at the thorax and 20-30 psi at the shoulder. Padding greater than 20 psi in compressive strength may be too stiff for the thorax of older subjects. 5.
