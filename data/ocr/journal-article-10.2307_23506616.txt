<plain_text><page sequence="1">REFLECTIONS ON THE TEXT AND CONTEXT OF THE DISPUTATION OF BARCELONA MARTIN A. COHEN Hebrew Union College - Jewish Institute of Religion, New York, N. Y. SEVEN centuries have elapsed since Moses ben Nahman and Paul Christian1 battled, like doughty knights, before King James I of Aragon in their verbal joust at Barcelona, and one since serious scholarship has lent the affair a measure of its interest. Jewish his torians have acknowledged its important role in the annals of their past and have grouped it with the so-called Disputation of Paris and the more correctly styled Disputation of Tortosa in a sort of trinity of troubles to dramatize the problems of the Jew in an alien mediaeval world.2 Yet despite the passage of time and the display of scholarly interest, we still do not know the real significance of the debate. Adequate answers have not been proffered for the most basic questions that can be posed about it. Who was responsible for calling the debate? How was its agenda determined? What strategy of attack and and defense did the antagonists employ? Who won the debate? How was the disputation related to the subsequent anti-Jewish legislation which emerged from the royal palace? What was the purpose of the debate? Why did Nahmanides publish his record of the disputation nearly two years after it was held? Was this publication responsible for his emigrating from his native Gerona and seeking the solace of the Holy Land for the remaining days of his life? These questions tantalize us with their possibilities, but frustrate us because they must be answered, and there are too few documents to help. Time has niggardly spared us only fragments of the pertinent events. These include two accounts of the proceedings, Nahmanides' 1 He is most frequently called Pablo Christiani, though his name was probably Pau (Nahmanides called him Pol) Christiâ. See C. Roth, "The Disputation of Bar celona (1263)," Harvard Theological Review XLIII (1950), p. 118. 1 The best studies of the debate are those of F.

COHEN [2] version3 and a Latin protocol explaining the debate from the view point of the Church,4 a handful of royal decrees compromising the position of the Jews of Aragon after the disputation, and an even lesser number of documents resulting from the publication of Nah manides' booklet two years later.5 The paucity of official papers dis appoints the scholar, but not nearly as much as the inadequacy of the two extant accounts of the debate. The Latin protocol merely sum marizes its salient events in the terse, cold language of officialism. It states the questions considered, abstracts some of the discussion, woefully omits what does not suit its purposes, and grudgingly in eludes colorful tidbits whose notoriety overcame its reluctance to record them. By comparison, Nahmanides' account inundates the reader with its torrent of details and the celerity of its motion. It enables the reader to relive the debate, to capture the excitement of the palace where three of its four sessions were held, and to pulsate with foreboding in the atmosphere of the monastery which provided the scene for the second day's meeting.6 The mounting tension, the searing hatreds, the cant and conniving that inevitably accompany such public displays, project vividly through its pages. The only danger which besets the reader of Nahmanides' account is that the dazzling realism of his narrative, contrasted with the pall and laconism 3 Published by J. C.

A second perusal of Nahmanides' booklet will not tarnish the appreciation of its beauty, but will expose these flaws. The reader will recognize, despite Nahmanides' insistence on having written an ac count of all the discussions, that his text gainsays such completeness. It is too brief to be a full record of four days' proceedings, too detailed at times to be a summary, too desultory to reflect a sense of continuity, too discursive to reveal a logical sequence, too partisan to be accepted uncritically. Its unevenness betrays it: it treats the events of the first two days with a fulness of data, but the last two with a frustrât ing, almost an incriminating meagerness of detail. Nahmanides had no stenographer to record the process of the debate; in fact, he was in all probability prohibited from committing any part of the discussions to writing.7 By the time he did so, late in 1264 or early in 1265,8 the usual erosions by time and passion had worked their distortion on his memory.9 What therefore issued from Nahmanides' pen was a candid reproduction of events as he then recalled them, but not necessarily as they had been. By comparison, the Latin protocol was written not as Paul's personal observations, but as the authoritative record of the church men. It bears all the marks of early composition, though it could hardly be expected to have been drastically different if the composition were late.10 It does not suffer from the hiatuses and inconsistencies found in Nahmanides' account, but then again it does not deal with details or yield as much information. In such a predicament, any attempt to compare the accounts for the purpose of determining the superiority of one or the other is gratuitous. Yet scholars have indulged in such superfluities ever since Graetz in his Carlylian fashion exalted Nahmanides' role in the dispu 7 See below, pp. 187 ff. 8 The document dated April 12, 1265, is the earliest reference we have to a written account of the disputation by Nahmanides. See below, pp. 187 ff. 9 Loeb, op. cit., p. 9, admits the inexactness of Nahmanides' text but minimizes it. 10 Loeb, op. cit., p. 7, disbelieves the date of July 20, 1263, under which the Latin protocol was written, because some of the events it mentions occurred later. He infers that the account may not have been written until the fracas over Nah manides' version two years later. Loeb is totally unjustified in both assertions. The date on the document need not have been that of composition. In official registers it is not uncommon to list events by the first date on which they occurred, and the Latin protocol was an official document. The attempt to relate it to the events of 1265 has no evidence to support it.</page><page sequence="4">160 MARTIN A. COHEN [4] tation at Paul's expense," or at least since Father Heinrich Denifle, incensed at Graetz's picture, took up the cudgels on behalf of the Christian protagonist and intemperately branded Nahmanides' ac count as a lie.12 Since Denifle's time scholars, Jewish and Christian, have seemed to prefer the meatier Jewish text, and with either a slap at the Christian text, or a deferent disregard for its contents, have proceeded to rely on Nahmanides for their reconstruction of the proceedings. The acceptance of the Jewish text has generally been accompanied by the invention of a Jewish context to supply necessary details lacking in the account. Nahmanides is therefore pictured as strutting into the theological lists inspired by zeal to defend his faith and people, demanding freedom of speech and insisting upon a fair agenda, and proceeding to discomfit his opponent repeatedly with the superiority of his knowledge and dialectic. So successful is he that many Christians, obviously provoked by the humiliation of their hero, but claiming that the continuation of the debate will only result in dire consequences for the Jews, convince Nahmanides to attempt to stop it prematurely. The king refuses his request, and Nahmanides has no choice but to proceed to victory.13 This picture idealizes, or more correctly, caricatures the scholar who participated in the debate, and what is worse, disregards a multi tude of conflicting details. It is another example of the inevitable result of the attempt to raise partisanship to the level of objectivity. Interestingly, it finds a compensatory obverse in the story of the dis putation recorded in a well-known Spanish encyclopedia, where it is related that the Jewish protagonist lost the debate, converted to Christianity and became a successful missionary among his former coreligionists.14 In any such problem what is required is a disinterested approach to the text, and an interested quest for a realistic context. The effort to reconstruct the reality of the Disputation of Barcelona from the sparse relics in our possession demands a recognition of the inadequacy of both texts and therefore, faute de mieux and no evidence to the contrary withstanding, the utilization of both with caution and without prejudice. With such an approach enough details can be discovered to 11 H. Graetz, Geschichte der Juden, Leipzig (Oskar Leiner), n.d. (190-?), pp. 120 f. 12 Op. cit., p. 229.

The Texts of the Disputation The texts of the disputation point to one inescapable conclusion, that the debate was not an open discussion, but rather a demonstration of Christian intellectual superiority contrived in advance. Its antagonists were carefully chosen, its agenda determined, its direction planned and its conclusion foreseen before the first step was taken to translate the idea of a disputation into a reality. The two antagonists were leaders of their respective faiths. Paul, who had been born a Jew, possibly at Montpellier, and had acquired more than a modicum of the traditional talmudic education under the guidance of Rabbi Eliezer of Tarascon,15 was now a Christian monk. He was a member of the recently established but already potent Dominican order, which prided itself on being the intellectual arm of the Church. The strong shield of knowledge and the blade of keen argument were the weapons with which it so often battled against heresies from within and the conflicting monotheisms of Islam and Judaism from without.16 Paul was an asset to its ranks. His background qualified him to become a missionary among the Jews, and he quickly acquired renown in the communities of Provence for his sermons to his former coreligionists, in which he sought to demonstrate that not only the Bible but the literature of the rabbis as well, assented to the verity of the cardinal principles of the Christian faith.17 Recently, possibly since 1258, when Aragon had renounced her interests in Provence, Brother Paul had concentrated his activities in Catalonia and Aragon. In his projects and peregrinations he could hardly have 15 See E. Renan, "Les rabbins français du commencement du quatorzième siècle," Histoire littéraire de la France XXVII (Paris, 1877), pp. 562-69; H. Gross, Gallia Gallia Judaica (Paris, 1897), pp. 4-6, and S.

COHEN [6] failed to brush against many a learned Jew, and test the soundness of his arguments against rabbinic knowledge deeper than his own. It is likely that on one such occasion or more he had met head on with the foremost scholar among the Jews in Spain, Moses ben Nah man, the maestre or head of the wealthy, intellectual and influential community of Gerona.18 Nahmanides, almost a septuagenarian, basked in the prestige of nearly a half century of achievement, not only as a scholar and creative interpreter of the tradition of Judaism, but also as a diplomat who had tactfully mediated in the controversies between the Maimunists and anti-Maimunists, and, indubitably as well, as a loyal servant of the crown.19 Who brought Paul Christian and Moses Nahmanides together in Barcelona? Some say that Paul started it all, that his conversionist activities had met with disaster, and that in desperation he called for the debate, hoping that with a victory he might reingratiate himself with his Dominican superiors and effect large-scale conversions of the Jews.20 One version of this interesting explanation claims that Paul insisted on battling with Nahmanides, for he was the recognized head of the Jewish community,21 but another states that Nahmanides was chosen by the Jews to be their champion, to the consternation of the former Jew called Christian.22 Both versions concur that Nahmanides agreed to participate in the debate, but neither stops to raise the question as to why a Jew of his stature should be willing to involve himself in such a nefarious enterprise, which boded no good for his people. In reality these explanations are factitious, constructed on no evidence whatever. Neither the Jewish nor the Christian account of the disputation credits Paul with instigating the debate. The only information on its genesis derives from the Christian text, composed by Paul's fellow Dominicans. This protocol clearly states, that the king called for the debate at the urging of the Dominicans (ad instan tiam fratrum predicatorum). Heinrich Graetz, who imagined the 18 See S.

While it is possible that Brother Paul conceived the idea of the disputation, it appears clearly that it was presented to the king as the official recommendation of the Dominican order. Both texts agree on the manner of Nahmanides' involvement. Neither says a word about his election as the representative of the Jews, neither about an invitation from Paul or the Dominicans or the king. On the contrary, both concur in stating that Nahmanides was ordered to represent the Jews at Barcelona. Even before Nahmanides says צוה אותי ארוננו המלך להתוכח עם פראי פול בהיכלו, he alludes to his dilemma in his introductory apologia. Obviously thinking of himself, he cites the case of the talmudic worthies who were compelled to debate with the disciples of Jesus and to answer the inane questions they posed, because these worthies were close to the ruling powers of the Christian society in which they lived. Though overlooked by scholars, this introduction agrees with all other details at our disposal that the Dominicans initiated the debate, selected their own spokesman, and, perhaps with the king's help, the spokesman for the opposition as well.26 The Dominicans' control is even more clearly seen in the détermina tion of the agenda for the disputation. Fortunately the two texts are in essential agreement on the subjects of the debate. The adversaries agreed to discuss first, whether the Messiah had come, as the Christians believed, or not, as the Jews insisted. Then they promised to turn to the question of the nature of the Messiah: was he God or man or both 23 Op. cit., p. 120. Cf.

According to the Dominican account, the disputants would then proceed to consider the question of whether the Messiah suffered and died for the human race. Nahmanides omits this question from his agenda, though his text gives three indications that the topic was broached during the disputation. That he should have suppressed it is understandable, since the mere consideration of this point implied an assent to Christian doctrine that Jesus was the Messiah. Finally the knights of God would conclude with a discussion on whether Judaism or Christianity represented the true faith. At least so says Nahmanides. The Dominicans report that the debaters would decide whether Jewish law and ceremonial were still valid, which is to say the same thing with a Christian bias.27 On the surface the agenda appears to favor the Jews. Nahmanides informs us that he had obtained from the king the right to speak freely in the debate, and it is assumed that he exercised this right in the determination of the questions to be discussed.28 Only the cardinal principles of Christianity were placed on the agenda, and the burden of proof appeared to fall squarely on Paul's shoulders. Even the progression of the questions seemed to favor Nahmanides, for should he succeed in refuting one, the rest would be stripped of their meaning and victory would be his. And if Paul tried to buttress his case with statements from the rabbis, Nahmanides' unquestioned superiority in this area could be expected to foil his every thrust. Nahmanides' position could not have been stronger. With the weight of his knowl edge and the apparent advantage of the agenda, nothing less than a lightning victory should have ensued. Why it did not come about is a question that merits consideration. But logically prior to this question is another one. Why did Paul allow Nahmanides to cozen him into an unfavorable agenda? Certainly he had no need to fear that Nahmanides might retreat from the debate unless the agenda satisfied him. Nahmanides had been commanded to debate. Why then was Nahmanides permitted such freedom and power? The truth is that he was permitted neither. Whatever the purpose of Paul and the Dominicans might have been in calling the debate, they had no intention of compromising their position and they were far too shrewd to fall into a trap. The account of the fixing of the agenda, found in the Latin protocol, provides the beginning of an understanding of what really happened. Cf. Baer, . . . לבקורת, p. 183. 18 Vikuafr, p. 5, lines 14 ff.; Graetz, op. cit., p. 121; Régné, op. cit., Revue des études juives LX (1910), p. 199.</page><page sequence="9">[9] REFLECTIONS ON THE DISPUTATION OF BARCELONA 165 The Christian account informs us that the aim of the disputation was not to impugn the truths of Christianity, "which because of its certainty cannot be subjected to debate" {que propter sui certitudinem non non est in disputatione ponenda). Rather, it was to destroy the errors of the Jews (!), and to undermine the confidence of those who believed that the Jewish spokesmen could confute any and all arguments on behalf of Christianity. When the agenda of the debate is regarded in this light, it becomes obvious that the Dominicans intended, not to defend their faith, but to prove its validity step by step to the Jews, moving with inductive logic from the simple fact of the Messiah's coming to the ineluctable conclusion regarding Judaism's obsolescence and its replacement by Christianity as the one true faith. This should not be at all surprising; the method was a hackneyed one. It was the method of scholastic writing, teaching and discussion, and the Dominicans excelled in all.29 The Dominicans were primarily teachers. Three years before Barcelona, Humbert of Romains, the Master General of the order, could proudly proclaim: "We teach the people, we teach the prelates, we teach the wise and unwise, religious and seculars, clerics and laymen, nobles and peasants, lowly and great."30 He might have broadened his remarks to include Moslems and Jews as well. Since 1259, a Dominican institute for the study of Arabic had been flourishing in Barcelona and graduating competent missionaries; and though the first such college for Hebrew studies was not formally opened until 1310,31 the Dominicans zealously studied Hebrew and rabbinic literature and gloried in the publication in 1278 of the Pugio Fidei of Raymond Martin (Marti), who, like Paul Christian, sought to prove the verity of Christianity from the state ments of the rabbis themselves.32 The Dominicans were thus always prepared to debate with learned men of all persuasions whom they regarded as misinformed, or inadequately informed, and therefore in need of instruction. Paul so regarded his opponent. And since the Dominicans utilized the device of public discussions as part of the curriculum of their conventual schools,33 Paul had every right to consider his activity in Barcelona as a kind of extension course. A careful study of Nahmanides' account supports this contention. 2י See A. Little, "The Mendicant Orders," in The Cambridge Medieval History VI (Cambridge, 1936), pp. 741 ff. 30 Quoted by Mandonnet, "Preachers," p. 360a. 31 Mandonnet, Saint Dominique, I, p. 195. 32 Wagenseil, op. cit., p. 2, again quoting Bosquet, informs us that Raymond of Penyafort had such institutes before 1310 and seems to imply that Raymond Martin and Paul Christian studied in such classes. 33 Mandonnet, "Preachers," pp. 360-61.</page><page sequence="10">166 MARTIN A. COHEN [10] According to Nahmanides, he had agreed to debate only cardinal issues involving the two religions, but as early as the second day of the debate, Nahmanides complained about the discussion of the Messiah, which he contended was not central to Judaism.34 Much more important is the fact that at no time during the debate was Nahmanides per mitted to take the offensive by asking questions or opening discussion on a topic. When he asked permission to be the questioner in one session, the king peremptorily refused him.35 From the beginning to the end of the debate, Brother Paul was at the helm. He confidently posed questions, intrepidly challenged answers, and exuded a self assurance which Nahmanides makes no effort to hide in his account. Paul could well afford this position, because the king supported him in everything he said. He repeatedly interrupted and silenced Nah manides' objections,36 and compelled him to proceed to the discussion of new items before prior questions had been proved to his satisfac tion.37 Despite the imperfection and disorder of Nahmanides' account, it appears that Paul and the king had agreed to drive home a lesson, and not to be deterred by the cogency of their opponent's remarks. We need not doubt that Nahmanides enjoyed freedom of speech. Without it the disputation could have lost its drama and Paul the opportunity of displaying his rabbinic knowledge ingeniously and effectively. But this freedom was bestowed after Paul presented Nahmanides with the agenda of the debate. Nahmanides claims that he agreed to the agenda,38 but if he did, it was because he had no other choice. The Dominicans, it must be remembered, were not reputed to be poor planners. They had conceived the debate. They had prepared their best men for participation. They had induced the king to join them in the elaborate plans and obviously considerable expenditures required for its staging, and to invest in it time and energy which ostensibly could better be used in more pressing pursuits. They could hardly have viewed the affair as an intellectual exercise or a diversion, but even if they had, they would have had to guard against the shame of defeat and the bane of its certain embarrassment.39 Their arrange ment of the debate, their formulation of the agenda, and their control of the discussion, leave no doubt that they wanted to insure the triumph of their protagonist. 34 Vikuah, p. 12, lines 1 ff. 3s Ibid,., p. 17, line 29. 3' Ibid., pp. 9 (lines 27 ff.); 11 (lines 6 ff.); 13 (lines 11 ff.); 17 (line 29); 18 (lines 9. 25). 3' Ibid., p. 18, lines 1 ff. 38 ibid., p. 5, line 23. 3« Roth, op. cit., p. 121, seems to view the disputation as an intellectual exercise.

The Latin account concludes by saying of Nahmanides, י ' Unde putet, quod non audet nec potest suam erroneam credenciam defensure"defensure"defensure" (Wherefore it is clear that he dares not, and cannot, defend his erroneous belief). On the other hand, Nahmanides relates that at the conclusion of the final session, the king, though as firm in his Christianity as ever, could not help but express admiration for the Geronese Jew's mastery by exclaiming, "Never have I seen a man in the wrong plead his case as excellently as you have."40 A week later, Nahmanides goes on to tell us, as he was preparing to return to Gerona, the king dismissed him amicably and regaled him with a purse of three hundred gold pieces (sueldos?), presumably to defray his ex penses.41 These amenities, however, do not becloud the essential fact that Nahmanides left Barcelona as he had entered, vanquished. If we are to appreciate the contents of the debate and the events which followed it, we have no alternative but to credit Brother Paul with a predetermined victory over a hopelessly handicapped opponent. A careful scrutiny of the arguments of the debate, as Nahmanides records them, will substantiate this view. Scholars may delight in turning Paul into a straw man, who entered the lists unprepared and incompetent and spent four days absorbing withering blows from a Jew, but the picture the texts paint is quite different. They reveal that Paul had prepared a powerful offensive, which, with the occasional assist of the judges, could not be stopped, much less turned into a rout. Paul's attack was based upon his often tested contention that the Jewish tradition, particularly the writings of the rabbis, gave evidence that the Messiah or Christ had come, that he possessed a theanthropic nature, and that he had suffered and died for men's sins. Though such claims may have met with disbelief on the part of Jews, they were not chimeras in Paul's mind. He knew rabbinic literature well, and realized that within that literature there were texts to support every point he would make. There were, to be sure, as many texts to contradict him, but with these he was not concerned. After all, had not the rabbis always cited only those texts which sustained their views and ignored all others? Paul foresaw only one obstacle. While rabbinic literature buttressed his claims regarding the Messiah or the Christ, it naturally did not equate the Christ with Jesus. Paul therefore decided upon an extra ordinary stratagem. He determined not to discuss Jesus at all, and to י« Vikuak, p. 21, line 15. 41 Ibid., p. 22, lines 23 ff.</page><page sequence="12">168 MARTIN A. COHEN [12] make his points only about the Messiah in general. If he could prove that according to Jewish texts the Messiah had come and gone, it would follow that the Jewish expectation of the Messiah in the future was vain and that Christianity was therefore superior. In this way Paul would also spare himself the burden of defending the Messianic role of Jesus. Nahmanides immediately sensed the danger in Paul's opening gambit, and on the very first day of the debate, he tried to inveigle his opponent into an identification of Jesus with the Messiah, but Master Giles, the king's justiciary, came to Paul's rescue. "Right now," he warned Nahmanides, "we are not discussing Jesus. The question rather is whether the Messiah has come."42 In the succeeding days of the debate, Nahmanides, at every opportunity, insisted desperately that Jesus was not and could not have been the Messiah whom they were discussing, but his words fell on deaf ears. When he later wrote his recollections of the debate, he put the name of Jesus in Paul's mouth in several instances where it would hardly have been prudent for Paul to mention Jesus,43 and in one case he even makes Paul translate by "Jesus" the word "Messiah" which appears in a biblical verse.44 That Paul avoided the equation of the Messiah with Jesus, except perhaps in his obiter dicta, is evident from the examples he uses, from the entire course of his argument and even from the Christian account of the proceedings. The Latin document mentions the name of Jesus only twice, both conjoined to the word Christ, both in quotations from Nahmanides, and both representing attempts by the sage from Gerona to discredit the reputed Messianic role of Jesus. Nor was Paul's decision to rely on rabbinic literature an unstudied move. He knew that the legal writings of the rabbis, the Halakhah, could not support him, for it did not deal with the questions he was eager to discuss. He had to rely on the homilies, the legends and the traditional tales that constitute the 'Aggadah, and he knew that the 'Aggadah did not carry the same weight as the Halakhah, that there was no obligation to believe it and that in many circles it was not believed. However, he recognized one salient fact that scholars have often overlooked, namely, that the 'Aggadah provided the foundation for much of the theology and theosophy of the Jews of Spain and France in the thirteenth century and that among the scholars who treasured and believed and leaned heavily upon the 'Aggadah was none other than Nahmanides himself.

The Maimunist rationalists declaimed against the naive expressions and tales in the 'Aggadah, cautioned Jews against believing them literally and attempted to allegorize them into respectability.45 Their opponents quickly accused them of breaking away from the traditions of Judaism, and their leaders, men like Solomon of Montpellier and Jonah of Gerona, the latter a first cousin of Nahmanides, continued to hold firmly to a literal belief in all their traditional texts, even those which depicted the Deity with the grossest of anthropomorphisms and anthropopa thisms.46 Nahmanides too entered the fray, not as a headstrong litigant, but as a composed mediator, seeking to avert a painful breach in the house of Israel; but where his sympathies lay was never in doubt.47 He belonged to the camp of the fundamentalists, to those who con demned "anyone expounding the words of our rabbis and their 'Aggadahs not according to Rashi's words."48 And even if he be credited with refusing at times to succumb to their extreme literalness, or even with protesting against their uncritical application of matter and form to God, his works clearly reveal that he was not above doing the same thing. Nahmanides, it might be recalled, was the champion of the cause of Kabbalah in Gerona.49 Early in the thirteenth century this city had bred an intense and intelligent group of mystics, who pursued their esoteric speculations as if in defiance of Maimonidean rational ism. Men like Ezra and Azriel and their renowned pupil, Nahmanides, 45 On this controversy see J.

COHEN [14] joined others in tapping the universe for answers to life with the devices of mysticism, precisely as their opponents were doing with the tools of philosophy. And both groups produced doctrines too dangerous to publicize!50 While the Maimonideans' troubles stemmed from their excessive reliance upon metaphysics, the problem of the mystics lay in their exaggeration and imaginative extensions of the literal meaning of the 'Aggadah to the point where they were actually measuring the physical attributes of their Maker!51 The 'Aggadah was the clay with which all Kabbalists worked. "For them," a leading authority on Jewish mysticism tells us, "the 'Aggadah is not just a dead letter. They live in a world historically continuous with it and they are able, therefore, to enhance it, though in the spirit of mysticism. 'Aggadic productivity has been a constant element of Kabbalistic literature, and only when the former disappears will the latter, too, be doomed to extinction."52 Again and again we find evidence among the friends and foes of the thirteenth century Kabbalah of the indispensable role which the 'Aggadah, accepted literally, played among them. Paul knew and exploited all this. His Dominican order had fol lowed the events of the Maimunist-anti-Maimunist controversy with heightened interest and, according to many Jewish historians, had actually participated in the burning of Maimonides' books in the squares of Paris. Furthermore, they had themselves precipitated a similar controversy in Christendom by denouncing the rationalistic lucubrations of the Averroists. In the very year of the disputation at Barcelona Pope Urban IV reiterated the Church's prohibitions against Aristotle's Physics, Metaphysics and other works.53 The Dominicans and Brother Paul knew very well where Nahmanides stood and what he believed. It is, therefore, astonishing that at the beginning of the second day's debate Nahmanides categorically denied the importance of the 'Aggadah in Judaism. Instead, he stressed the opinion held by the 5° See Meshullara di Piera, שירים, Canto XL, vv. 31 ff., in H. Brody, ידיעות המכון לחקר השירה העברית בירושלים IV (Berlin-Jerusalem, 1938).

It can best be explained as a move of desperation to undermine the foundation of Paul's entire argument, now that the attempt to do so by equating Jesus with the Messiah had failed. Nahmanides had made an effort in this direction on the first day of the debate. When Paul produced the first Midrash to substantiate his first argument, Nah manides announced that he did not believe that 'Aggadah. Paul then pounced on his words and exclaimed to the assembly, "See how he denies the writings of the Jews." At this point Nahmanides did not attempt to explain the difference between Halakhah and 'Aggadah. Instead he retreated and agreed to accept the 'Aggadah "for argument's sake."55 Nahmanides on the first day had apparently not as yet brought himself to an outright denial of the place of the 'Aggadah in Judaism. The denial came on the second day. Like his attempt to link Jesus with the Messiah, this too was doomed to failure, for neither Paul nor the judges were prepared to countenance such an argument.56 The debate began with a lengthy preliminary discussion. It was at this time that Paul and Nahmanides "agreed" on the agenda and each measured the strength of his opponent. Paul announced that he would invoke the rabbis' writings to support his contentions, and Nafimanides tried to discredit this procedure. Paul reciprocated by seeking to prove that neither Nahmanides nor anyone else was an authorized spokesman for the Jewish community. He turned to Gen. 49:10, a favorite verse in Christian polemics, and the rabbis' explanation that it bespoke the endless chain of spiritual leadership that God had promised Israel. But, contended Paul, the chain of ordination had been snapped, and Nahmanides had no right to call himself Maestre or Rav. Needless to say, Nahmanides fought back with his arsenal of stock arguments.57 When such pleasantries had been exchanged, the disputants turned to the agenda. The Messiah has come, claimed Paul, and to prove it he invoked the 'Aggadah. He produced a famous Midrash telling that 54 Vikua.fi, p. 10, lines 10 ff. 55 Ibid., p. 8, lines 19 ff. 56 The Latin protocol places Nahmanides' denial after the record of the dis cussion of the third question on the agenda, but Nahmanides could hardly have waited so long. It appears that the Latin account, which does not even mention the fact the debate lasted for several days and sessions, was more concerned with a logical than a chronological presentation of its proceedings. 5' Vikuafi, pp. 5 ff.</page><page sequence="16">172 MARTIN A. COHEN [16] an Arab had recognized in the miraculous lowing of a Jewish farmer's cow, first that the Temple had been destroyed and then, immediately thereafter, that the Messiah had been born.58 He then turned to the tractate Sanhédrin of the Talmud and noticed there that Elijah believed that the Messiah was already on earth, and that he could be located at the gates of a certain city. According to Rashi, whom the fundamentalists followed obediently, this city was Rome!59 Nahman ides finally conceded that the rabbinic tradition supported Paul's claim that the Messiah had been born, but he tried to save his day by insisting that though he had been born, he had as yet not come. He sought desperately to explain the Messiah's longevity on the analogy of the long-lived antediluvian worthies mentioned in the Bible, but succeeded in convincing no one that the Messiah appeared on earth more than a millennium before but had as yet not revealed himself. The king therefore pressed Nahmanides to reveal the place where the Messiah was keeping himself, and Nahmanides, recognizing that he could not mention Rome or any other locale on earth, retorted with what he calls irony but what may better be described as the reckless taunt of a prisoner sported before his captives, that the Messiah might be found at the gates of Toledo, and that the king might send a courier there to find him out.60 It is not surprising that the king took his remark as a signal to suspend deliberations for that day. In the next session of the debate Nahmanides, who had had time to think matters over, first declared that the Messiah had been living in the Garden of Eden. Little did he realize that even this statement would cost him dearly in a subsequent discussion. Then Nahmanides proceeded to contradict himself and to deny categorically that he believed the Messiah had come, and he strove to no avail to turn the discussion to a consideration of Jesus' qualifications for the Messiah ship.61 Paul's arguments to support his view that the Messiah possessed a theanthropic nature are the most interesting of the debate. In order to confuse his opponent and compromise his position, he decided first cleverly to alternate rabbinic statements alleging the Messiah's divinity with others that illuminated his human qualities, and to follow these with carefully selected passages implying that he was simultaneously human and divine. Was the Messiah divine? Yes, said Paul, turning to Isa. 52:13, 58 Lam.

He shall be exalted and lifted up and shall be very high." The rabbis themselves had identified God's servant with the Messiah and had explained the verse to mean that the Messiah would be exalted above Abraham, lifted up above Isaac, and raised higher than the ministering angels.62 They had applied the verse to Prince Zerubbabel, who was often viewed as the Messiah, and who, of course, had already come. Agreeing with the rabbis and the Christian tradition, Paul asserted that only to the Messiah could the superhuman qualities mentioned by the rabbis be applied.63 Was the Messiah human? Yes, said Paul, and he turned to Dan. 9:24 ff., another favorite passage of the polemicists.64 His intention was not to become involved in a long discussion of the meaning of the seventy weeks mentioned in these verses, but apparently he could not avoid it. According to a Jewish tradition,65 accepted by the Chris tians, the seventy years began with the Babylonian Exile and ended with the destruction of the Second Temple and the appearance (and death) of the Messiah, but Nahmanides had to insist that the verses referred to the human prince Zerubbabel, and that nowhere before the twelfth chapter of Daniel was there any allusion to the time of the coming of the Messiah. It was an unconvincing argument, if for no other reason than the fact that Nahmanides himself had made extensive use of the early chapters in the Book of Daniel in his own messianic calculations, and even availed himself of the passage in the ninth chapter which Paul was discussing.66 Once more, therefore, Paul forced Nahmanides into a self-contradiction where the only alternative was complete acquiescence in a major Christian line of messianic interpretation. A moment later Nahmanides was embarrassed again. The discus sion logically turned to the final chapter of Daniel, to the eleventh and twelfth verses, and to an interpretation of the meaning of the discrepancy of forty-five days in the reckoning found in these two verses. In accordance with a Jewish tradition, Paul explained that these forty-five days were to be interpreted literally67 and he went on 62 Tanhuma, ed. Buber, Toledot, p. 139. Cf.

COHEN [18] to say that they represented the time when the Messiah was con cealed; but Nahmanides, recognizing the implication that the Messiah had come and the strong possibility that Christians would apply these forty-five days to an incident in Jesus' life, insisted on inter preting the word "day" as "year,"68 and produced numerous rabbinical statements to support this exegesis. The king, however, picked a Jew at random, asked him what the word in question "YOM" meant, and he responded that it meant day. This shamed Nahmanides and angered him into declaring that this Jew was not fit to judge in the matter. To be sure he was not, and the king knew it, but this realization in in no way alleviated Nahmanides' chagrin. Paul's intention in turning to Dan. 9:24 ff. was rather to stress the human quality of the Messiah, to show that the prince destined to be cut off (verse 26) was the anointed one (verse 25), who in turn was the "most holy" of the previous verse. The rabbis generally inter preted the words קדש קדשים of v. 24 to mean "the most holy place," or the sanctuary.69 Paul applied them to the Messiah, and not without reason, for it was known even to Christian circles that this was Nahmanides' own interpretation as well.70 Brother Paul had scored another point. He then returned to the divinity of the Messiah, citing the Midrash which pictured the Messiah as having entered the Garden of Eden,71 and implying that only superhuman qualities could have secured him admission. Nahmanides' rebuttal evidences that he did not misunder stand Paul's intention, for he discusses the details of the Midrash in question and then asks whether such things could be said of God himself. Since Nahmanides had previously professed that the Messiah was in the Garden of Eden, he now admitted that this was his abode, but stressed that he was a man. There was to be sure a contradiction implicit in Nahmanides' reply, and Paul was ready for it. If the Messiah lived for centuries in the Garden of Eden, did this not attest to his superhuman nature? If he was a man, was he not subject to death like all other mortals? Brother Paul now claimed he was mortal, and to substantiate his 68 Vikuab, p. 15, lines 26 ff. 6' See Rashi ad loc.

He quoted Maimonides as saying that the Messiah would die, and that his son and after him his grandson would rule in his place. Apparently Nahmanides challenged Paul to produce the book containing this statement, and Paul not unnaturally asked for that book of Maimonides which speaks in some detail of the Messiah and the messianic age, affirming that the Messiah will not perform preternatural miracles and that in most ways there will be no differ ence between the messianic age and the world as we now know it. That book is the Mishneh Torah's Book of Judges, but it does not contain the statement that Paul made. Nahmanides tells us that Paul kept turning the pages of the book in a futile and increasingly embar rassing effort to locate it, and that the Jewish sage discredited him by declaring that the book did not contain the statement, and pointing out that the vision of the Messiah it presented was one more favorable to the Jews than to the Christians.72 If Nahmanides' account describes this discussion fully, there was one thing he forgot to tell his opponent, and that subsequent scholars have forgotten to mention, namely, that Maimonides did say precisely what Paul claimed he did, only in a different book. In his commentary to the famous tenth chapter of the Mishnah Sanhédrin, Maimonides says: והמשיח ימות וימלך אחריו בנו 73.ובן בנו Nahmanides may have suppressed this part of the discussion to avoid further mention of the name of the still controversial Maimon ides. He could, however, not suppress an admission that the rabbinic sages agreed with Paul's view. Thus though Nahmanides had previ ously insisted on the Messiah's superhuman longevity, he recognized that there had been Jews who believed that the Messiah, born of woman and of the seed royal of David, would live no longer than any other human being. Paul now turned to his tour deforce, a demonstration that Jewish literature attested to the simultaneous divinity and humanity of the Messiah. Here he called upon three carefully chosen biblical verses and their rabbinic interpretations, Ps. 110:1, Lev. 26:12 and Gen. 1:2. Ps. 110:1 reads "The Lord saith unto my lord, sit thou at My right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool." Who was the second "lord"? The rabbis recognized the problem and generally solved it by applying it to Abraham and his exaltation above Melchi 2ל Maimonides' Book of Judges, 11:3 f., 12:1 ff. נל Commentary to the Mishnah, Ch.

COHEN [20] zedek.74 Some, however, thought it spoke of the Messiah.75 This was logical, since the mention of Zion in the following verse suggests that the passage speaks of David rather than Abraham.76 The Zohar interpreted the first verse messianically,77 and perhaps the Gerona kabbalists did too, which might explain Paul's predilection for the passage. Nahmanides tried lamely to explain that the second "lord" refers to David, for though David was the author of the Psalm, he wrote it for the Levites to recite, and thus could refer to himself as "my lord" from their point of view. Nahmanides had some logic and rabbinic support on his side, but his rebuttal did not address itself to Paul's argument that the rabbis had seen the Messiah in the verse under consideration, or to his implication that the Messiah so men tioned was a human being who was exalted to a divine place beside that of the divine Father. The second verse further clarifies Paul's purpose. Lev. 26:12 quotes the Lord as saying that he will walk among his people and will be their God. Jewish tradition had long struggled with this verse. Onkelos, with his usual abhorrence of anthropomorphisms, altered it to read that God would place his Manifest Presence (the Shekhinah) in the midst of his people. Rashi, on the other hand, accepted anthropo morphisms and explained that God would walk with his people in the Garden of Eden as one of them, and no one would be afraid of him. Nahmanides, in his commentary to Leviticus, brought God down to earth. While he sought to avoid a crass ascription of matter and form to the Deity, he could not refrain from explaining that God's activity would be known among his people "like a king walking among his people." Nahmanides further insisted that the verse referred to this world and not to the world to come.78 Was Paul's use of the verse accidental? Could he have failed to realize that the Jewish tradition which depicted God as walking among men in human form was essentially the view cherished by Nahmanides? Indeed, Paul could not have picked a better verse to prove that God the Father had manifested himself on earth in a human form which coincided with the Christian idea of God the Son. Paul's next step was the obvious one. Fie took the words in Gen. 1:2, "and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters," and showed from the Midrash that the Jewish sages believed that the spirit of 4ל Lev.

He had found the text he wanted. It supported his view that the Messiah was God the Holy Spirit, and it completed most adequately his demonstration that from the Jewish tradition one could prove that the Messiah, at once human and divine, was inseparable from God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Ghost. Needless to say, Nahmanides does not reveal Paul's purpose in using these verses, and the casual reader may not, on his first reading, see their obvious connection to the trinitarian doctrine. But any doubt that this is what Paul had in mind is dispelled by a perusal of the monumental anti-Jewish work, the Pugio Fidei, written by Raymond Martin (Raymundo Marti), who was a contemporary of Paul Christian, a member of the same Dominican order, and part of the circle of Dominican monks who devoted themselves to a study of rabbinics for missionary purposes. The Pugio Fidei, first published in 1278, but clearly in the process of preparation at the time of the Disputation of Barcelona, reveals the messianic importance for the Dominicans of the biblical verses Paul used and interpretations of these verses which coincide with Paul's. Thus in the case of Ps. 110:1 Raymond explains that the Messiah was asked to sit at the right hand of God the Father (!), not that the Father possesses a right hand, but that this word represents divine bliss (beatitudo) .8° In the case of Lev. 26:12, the Pugio Fidei clearly states that only the Messiah (!), whom God from eternity had foreseen as never sinning, was worthy to draw nigh unto God, even to join and unite with him.81 In the case of Gen. 1:2, the Pugio Fidei unmistakably affirms that the spirit of God is the Spiritus Sanctus.82 These examples and others from the Pugio Fidei, including Paul's understanding of the words קדש קדשים in Dan. 9:24 to mean the יי Gen Rabbah 2:5. u Pugio 10 Pugio Fidei, p. 538: "Dixit Dominus Dominus (sic!) meo, Sede ad dextram meammeam etc. B.

COHEN [22] Messiah,83 not only support the above interpretation of Paul's argu ments, but point out as well that in these arguments he was speaking less as an individual than as a representative of an institution which in all probability was evolving an official approach for debates with Jews. Surprisingly, the Latin account omits Paul's entire argument on the second question of the agenda. Was it because the Dominicans were afraid to record for the reading of other learned Christians anything dealing with the nature of the Christ, a problem which caused the Church much trouble in its early days, which alienated many intellectuals since the beginnings of scholasticism, and which challenged all the ingenuity that the faithful doctors of the Church could muster? At least as early as Anselm's Cur Deus Homo the scholastic thinkers were eager to find a rationalistic explanation for the theanthropic nature of the Christ, and the problem was doubtlessly no less acute in face of the threat of the thirteenth century heretical movements. If this was the reason for the omission of the argument from the Latin protocol, it would tend to substantiate the view that each of the verses Paul Christian used was directly connected with proving the Church's conception of the true nature of the Christ. Reciprocally, as it were, Nahmanides omitted a full discussion of the next item, even to the point of suppressing the question from his version of the agenda, as we have already observed. But at least Nahmanides' record reveals three instances where the theme was discussed, and these agree substantially with the instances mentioned in the Latin version. In Nahmanides' booklet they are placed in an anomalous context in the record of the first and second day's pro ceedings. They include two 'aggadic statements, the first to prove that the Suffering Servant of Isa. 52:13-53:9 was the Messiah who suffered and died for his people,84 and the second, to emphasize the Messiah's willingness to assume the burden of suffering for his people in order to insure that the resurrection of the dead, — doubtlessly meaning for Paul the Messiah's own resurrection —, would take place in his time.85 Nahmanides, as was to be expected, countered by pointing out that 83 Ibid., p. 285. 8יי Vikuah, pp. 13-14.

In another instance, when the passage Isa. 52:13 was under discussion, Paul and the Dominicans even refused to hear the lengthy explanation which Nahmanides was prepared to give for the Suffering Servant.87 This rebuff probably led to Nahmanides' composition of a tract, now printed with his version of the disputation,88 in which he admits that the Servant in rabbinic literature is often the individual Messiah. He then proceeds to demonstrate that such a Messiah could not as yet have come. The debate may have ended before the fourth question was dis cussed.89 Neither account mentions it. The Latin protocol would have us believe that after the fourth session of the debate and before the fourth question could be discussed, Nahmanides took advantage of the king's temporary absence from Barcelona to flee from the city. Such a dramatic ending does not coincide with the facts. A week after the fourth session, Nahmanides tells us, he was in Barcelona to speak on behalf of the Jews in the synagogue where the king and the Domin icans had come to preach conversionist sermons.90 Nahmanides tells us that he remained in the city for this specific purpose. He could hardly have invented the incident at the synagogue, and this would hardly have taken place had he fled. If he had fled and returned, the Dominicans' willingness to let him speak and the king's display of friendship to him as he was about to leave the city could find no explanation. Interestingly, the Latin account says nothing of the meeting in the Barcelona synagogue. It seems clear that its report of Nahmanides' flight was a touch of sensational reporting totally out of keeping with the aridity of the rest of the account, but not with the purpose that the Dominicans had in mind. Whether the debate was inexplicably interrupted before the fourth session must remain a moot question, but it is not an important one. The fourth question did not have to be discussed. After Brother Paul's arguments in the discussion of the first three propositions of the debate, the fourth was no longer a subject for discussion, but a patent con 86 See commentators ad loc. and Neubauer-Driver, op. cit., passim. 8ל Vikuab, p. 9, line 20. 88 In Steinschneider's edition, pp. 23-26.

In the eyes of the judges, the Dominicans and the king, Paul had proved his point and victory was his. That Paul emerged from the debate with honor is made clear by his continued participation in the high councils of the Dominicans, his selection as the preacher of conversionist sermons to the Jews, his appointment to the commission on censorship of Jewish books in Aragon,91 and the esteem in which he was held by King Louis IX in his subsequent visits to the communities of Provence.92 The appearance of the king and the Dominicans in the synagogue of Barcelona eight days after the concluding session of the debate testifies further to their belief that Paul had run off with the victory. Otherwise they would have been less likely to intrude into the worship service of a Sabbath morning and to begin preaching, as did King James, on the Messiahship of Jesus, or expounding, as did the redoubt able Raymond of Penyafort, on the mystery of the Trinity. Incident ally, in so far as can be seen, they employed an approach not dissimilar to the one found in the Zohar and presumably the earlier mystic literature in Spain.93 Nor could we understand the series of decrees against the Jews94 and their sacred literature which began to issue from the royal palace, unless we posit a Christian victory in the debate. Only three weeks after his synagogue appearance, King James issued a decree, ordering his functionaries to welcome the Dominicans who would be coming to preach to the Jews, to aid them in assembling Jewish audiences, by force if necessary, and to protect Jewish converts to Christianity. Two days later the king ordered the seizure and burning of all the writings of Maimonides (!), whose Aristotelian arguments doubtlessly made him as suspect of abetting anti-Christian heresies as much as the pronouncements of the so-called Averroists in the Christian uni versities. The following day James informed his Jewish subjects that he had delegated Paul Christian to preach to them and admonished them to listen to him "meekly and favorably" (mansuete et favora biliter)biliter) and to respond to his queries "with humility and reverence" {humiliter et r ever enter). The same day the king commanded the Jews 91 Denifle, op. cit., pp. 235 f. 99 Rankin, op. cit., p. 161. « See Zohar III, 153b: ובך יתקיים רזא דיונה דעאל בעמקי! דתהוטי ימא הכי תיטול אנת בעמיקו דתהומי אורייתא הה"ד (יונה ב) ותשליכני מצולה בלבב ימים דהו! חכמה חסד נצח לימין דבגינייהו אסר דוד (תחלים קיח) ימין ה' עושה חיל ימין ה' רוממה ימין ה' עושה חיל ותלת משסאלא יתקשרון כחדא דאינון בינה גבורה הוד וני דרג'ן דאסצעיתא כתר תפארת 'סוד דאחידן בימינא ושמאלא. ובנין דחזא לך נביא מתקשר בתלת דרגין דאמצעיתא פתח עלך האי קרא (ישעיה נב) הנה ישכיל עבדי ירום ונשא וגבה מאד ובגין דאנת תהא אחיד בתרין משיחין אמר דוד על ג' ימינין דמשיח בן דוד ימין ה' תלת זמנין לקביל נ' שמאלי[ האחיד בהן משיח בן אפרים . ... 94 Published by Denifle, op. cit., pp. 234 ff.</page><page sequence="25">[25] REFLECTIONS ON THE DISPUTATION OF BARCELONA 181 to erase from their sacred books those passages which the Christians regarded as objectionable. To supervise this project he appointed a committee consisting of three Dominicans, Raymond of Penyafort, Arnold of Segarre and Paul Christian, the very three who figured prominently in the debate! A decree of August 30, 1263, somewhat mitigated the harshness of its predecessors. It instructed public officials not to compel the Jews to attend the Dominicans' sermons outside their ghettos or even within them. James tossed another scrap to the Jews on March 27, 1264, when he ruled that they would not be obligated to take the initiative in censoring their holy writings. But these palliatives did not neutralize the toxin of the previous decrees. On realizing the nature of the debate and studying these decrees, one cannot repress a question that insinuates itself with increasing intensity. Why was the debate necessary? The king did not require it as a prelude for the action he contemplated against the Jews. The power of legislation rested in his hands. The decrees reflected the wishes of the clergy. And if it was popular support the monarch craved, a few inflammatory sermons by the Dominicans would have sufficed to fan the hatred which flickered disturbingly in the popular breast. Cer tainly, the decrees were not conditioned upon King James' or Brother Paul's proving to anyone, least of all the clergy, that the Jews walked in religious darkness or that their writings attested to the coming of the Christ. The debate was indeed a demonstration. But what was it a demon stration of? The Context of the Disputation With this question we leave the analysis of the texts of the debate and the abundance of their evidence to enter into the knotty problem of its context. Here evidence is scarce, but the questions raised are pressing. The context must be reconstructed. The starting point for such a reconstruction is an unusual incident recorded in both texts of the debate. Nahmanides tells us that when all the notables were convened in the palatial hall at the beginning of the fourth day's sessions, he arose and surprised the assembly with an announcement that he did not wish to proceed with the debate. Pressure had been brought to bear upon him by people who were "afraid of the Dominicans, for they cast a pall of fear upon all." These people were not Jews, but Christians from all walks of life — commoners, nobles, ranking clergymen and even one of the major</page><page sequence="26">182 MARTIN A. COHEN [26] participants in the disputation, Brother Peter of Genoa himself. This numerous group had even enlisted the help of Jews to persuade Nahmanides to do his utmost to bring the disputation to a close.95 What was behind this extraordinary event? Was it, as some have claimed, that the Christians were concerned with Nahmanides' out spokenness and feared that its continuation would result in terrible reprisals against the Jews?96 If so, why did not the Jews take the lead in muzzling their spokesman? Why the sudden concern of the Christians, who knew before the debate began that such discussions inevitably led to untoward consequences for the Jews? Why did the Dominicans, who were also Christians and in the best position to gauge the impact and consequences of the debate, not join with the others? And why did the king brush aside Nahmanides' suggestion and order him to continue with the debate? Whatever the reasons might have been, they had nothing to do with a sudden surge of benevolence on the part of some Christians toward the Jews, or, as some may imply, with a fear on the Jews' part that their protagonist was losing the debate. By not ignoring it, the Latin account emphasizes the importance of the incident. Though it calls the entire plot a fabrication of Nah manides, it takes care to record that Brother Peter of Genoa disclaimed any participation in it. The lameness of this explanation, added to Nahmanides' reputation for political sagacity, reveals that the plot was not a figment but a fact. As such it exposed an embarrassing cleavage in the ranks of the Christians. The masses, the nobility, or at least the higher nobility,97 many Churchmen and representatives of the Franciscan order opposed the coalition of the king and the Domin icans, whose nature was becoming more obvious as the disputation progressed. By the end of the third day's proceedings — if not before — it was evident that the anticipated victory of the Christians would result in catapulting the Dominican order into a position of power and prestige guaranteed by the king himself. This recognition was sufficient to instil fear in all strata of the population. All Christians, to be sure, respected the Friars Preachers and their 95 Vikuah, p. 17, lines 19 ff. An interesting side light to Peter of Genoa's role can be seen in his agreement with Nahmanides on the rabbinic interpretation of Gen. 49:10 and then his cautious qualifications of this agreement.

Merriman points out that the kings of Aragon seem to have deliberately increased the prerogatives of the lower nobility as a counter weight to those of the barons or ricos-hombres who constituted the upper nobility. There were nine such barons in the time of James I.</page><page sequence="27">[27] REFLECTIONS ON THE DISPUTATION OF BARCELONA 183 indefatigable toil on behalf of Christianity, or more particularly, the Papacy.98 They were, as Pope Innocent IV described them, "a public horse, always ready to fight against the malice of heretics, to correct the straying of the faithful, to break the wickedness of tyrants, to accept all the burdens of the Church Universal . . . In the short span of their existence the Dominicans had conferred upon them the accolade of "special beloved sons of the Church."100 They had snuffed out the Albigensian heresy, beaten down Averroism in the universities, and with the prepotent weapon of the Inquisition they had intimidated into submission many who dared obstruct the Church's will. This is precisely why many Christians feared them. Bishops, jealous of their all but titular independence, were loath to subordinate them selves to the upstart Romanizers of the church.101 The Franciscans, who vied with the Dominicans for top billing as the defenders of Rome and the faith, had reason to display their understandable, albeit uncharitable, envy of their brethren. Churchmen, nobles and masses alike who saw what the Inquisition under the Dominicans had done to their counterparts in neighboring Provence and Catalonia, cringed at the thought that the Aragonese fueros forbidding it might some day be rescinded and the Inquisition extended to their native land.102 The nobles had even more to dread. Since the beginning of James' reign they had battled with desperate tenacity to prevent the king from diminishing their prerogatives and thus consolidating the power of his central government.103 Their success was phenomenal.

There can be no question about the fact that the church</page><page sequence="28">184 MARTIN A. COHEN [28] the king's Romancero, with its romantic flair, would have us believe that James could "fell the disloyal nobles with a glance,"104 reality was less inclined to favor him. He was constantly struggling against his nobles, gaining victories touted as permanent, which turned out to be short-lived. A mere three years before the Disputation of Barcelona, the relations between the king and nobles were strained to the breaking point, and James was making preparations for what seemed to be the inevitable civil war.105 The war had not yet come in 1263 and was eventually averted, but at the time of the disputation the tautness had not yet left the atmosphere of Aragon.106 It was evident that the king could benefit from the support of the Church and natural for the nobility to view such an alliance with alarm. Of course, the king would have to pay a price to the Dominicans for their support. This price could very well have been the granting to the Preachers complete hegemony in his realm over matters of the spirit, and the right to consider all Jews fair game for conversionist activities.107 If we examine the history of the kingdom of Aragon between the time of the disputation and the death of King James in 1276, the consistency of the above explanation with the facts at our disposal will become evident. From 1263 on King James managed to unify his realm, at least for his lifetime,108 and to exercise a greater measure of control than heretofore over his restive nobility. Though in former years his relations with the Papacy had been strained,109 they were men repeatedly threw their lot in with the nobility.

The nobles continued, however, to press for advantage and forced occasional concessions from the monarch. An interesting side light which seems to illuminate the Dominicans' desire for unity in the country is seen in the likely conspiracy of Raymond of Penyafort with Peter, oldest son of James, to prevent the king from bequeathing to a younger son, also named James, the territories of Valencia and the Balearic Isles. See Balaguer, op. cit., loc. cit. 10י These relations had reached their nadir in 1262 when Pope Urban IV sought</page><page sequence="29">[29] REFLECTIONS ON THE DISPUTATION OF BARCELONA 185 now harmonious by comparison, punctured only by an occasional jostling for supremacy between him and the Dominicans (!).1I0 The Jews, as evidenced by the decrees of August 1263, were seriously hurt and subjected to the Dominicans. But the damage to the Jews was limited to the spiritual realm; economically their favorable position remained essentially unaltered. By law they continued to be slaves of the imperial chamber and subjected as such to the whims of the monarch, who could cancel debts owed to them or otherwise use them as pawns in his political dealings but practically they continued to be James' honored servants, permitted to engage in a wide variety of endeavors and to reap the fruits and honors of their enterprise. In the very year, perhaps at the very time of the disputation, when the king was planning an expedition against the Moors, a Jew, named Jahudano, who can be identified as the bailiff of Zaragoza, Judah de la Caballerfa, came to his aid and provisioned his armies. This Jew, a chronicle tells us, was "the richest and most powerful in this dominion. The king had entrusted him with an important role in all the affairs of State .... He held the position of bailiff (bayle) and treasurer general."112 There were other such Jews after the disputation as before, and through the cloud of Dominican pressure and preaching, which stalwart Jews could withstand, life smiled as beneficently as heretofore upon the seed of Abraham in Aragon."3 Indeed, in 1273, when the Pope honored James with an invitation to the Council of Lyons, the Jews gratefully pre sented their monarch with a substantial purse for his journey. And in vain to prevent the marriage of James' son Peter and the daughter of the ex communicated Manfred of Sicily. See H. Mann, Lives of the Popes XV (London, 1929), pp. 157 f. 110 Thus James counseled his son-in-law, Alfonso the Wise of Castile to "keep the Church in his love." He was jealous, however, to prevent the encroachment of the Church in the economic sphere. He even restricted the endowments of the Church in Valencia. See H. J.

COHEN [30] when the king died three years later, the Jewish community un restrainedly bewailed his passing.114 All these facts suggest that the purpose of the disputation was to dramatize the new alliance between the Dominicans and the king. Such an alliance could not be announced as a political move, but had to be presented in a framework which would appeal to the sentiments that united all strata of the population. In thirteenth century Aragon these sentiments were religious. The people were united by Chris tianity. The king posed as its defender, and the Jews were regarded as its inveterate enemy. By humbling the Jews with their own literature the Dominicans, already renowned as fighters for their faith, could rise in the popular mind as the unparalleled champions of Christianity, and hope to win mass support away from nobles and local bishops. That the Dominicans did not succeed in doing so completely, as seen by the incident at the beginning of the final day's debate, evidences the power and prestige of the nobility and churchmen to which so many con temporary documents attest. Naturally, such demonstration of Dominican superiority could have succeeded only with the participation of the Jews; hence the orders given to Nahmanides. But why did Nahmanides not protest against being used in this way? Why did he not remonstrate with the king against the entire project of the disputation? Why did he not seek to discontinue the debate in its earliest stages, after his initial setbacks and embarrassments, particularly when the judges refused him the right to disprove the central Christian contention that Jesus was the Messiah? The fact is that Nahmanides did not protest, indeed, he acquiesced in the king's wishes and thus, to some extent at least, co-operated with the monarch in the staging of the debate. Such co-operation involved no hypocrisy on Nahmanides' part. Within the limitations of the debate, he was given permission to speak forth rightly and to defend his faith vigorously. It merely called for a loyalty to the king to go through with the spectacle, to accept the humiliation of defeat, thereby helping the king achieve his purpose, and to be rewarded thereafter with the king's largesse. Nahmanides effectively demonstrated his loyalty to the monarch during the course of the debate by his ostensibly naive, but actually diplomatic announcement to the king and the Dominicans, at the beginning of the fourth day's discussions, that forces were marshalling against his alliance and were seeking to interrupt the debate, an announcement that stunned a man like Peter of Genoa into a compromising denial. And King James reciprocated by continuing to befriend Nahmanides after the debate, 114 Amador de 10s Rîos, op. cit., p. 438.</page><page sequence="31">[31] REFLECTIONS ON THE DISPUTATION OF BARCELONA 187 as we have seen and shall have occasion to observe again. Much more important was the monarch's continued protection of the economic interests of the Jews of Aragon after the disputation. Would it be unreasonable to conjecture that Nahmanides recognized that his submission to the king's will and plan would be rewarded with the safeguarding of the physical well-being of the Jews of Aragon? Would it be out of keeping with the stature of the sage of Gerona, as a com munity leader and as an exemplary diplomat, to imagine that he was prepared to suffer unfairly the ephemeral pangs of humiliation in order to safeguard the security of his flock?115 We have no way of determining fully what brought on the Disputa tion of Barcelona, but a reconstruction such as this helps to explain the conflicting details in a coherent manner. Perhaps the future will reveal new data that will permit a more precise reformulation of the context of the debate. Such a reconstruction also helps unravel the imbroglio surrounding the publication of Nahmanides' account, nearly two years after the disputation. The publication came as a complete surprise, especially to the Dominicans, and their reaction was violent. This is under standable, since Nahmanides makes no effort to conceal the intellectual subtleties and subterfuge to which his opponent resorted, or the partial role of the judges in the debate. The Dominicans brought Nahmanides to trial, apparently on the charge of having violated his trust not to publish anything on the disputation, and probably demanded the severest of penalties. King James was prepared to mete out what he considered condign punishment, the banishment of Nahmanides from his realm for two years and the consignment of his tract to the flames.116 Disappointed by what they felt was James' undue leniency to Nah manides, the Dominicans objected to this sentence; whereupon James cancelled it and let it be known that in the future Nahmanides would have to answer to no one in this matter save the king alone.117 Why did Nahmanides compose his tract? Some scholars say he did so to counteract the Dominicans' propaganda and perhaps their 115 It might be added that the humiliation and defeat would not be accepted by the Jews, who did not share Paul's premise that the Messiah could be proved from rabbinic literature. Nahmanides' stature among his own people was thus in no way diminished; of his esteem among Christians as a religious thinker he could not have been at all concerned. 116 Denifle, op. cit., pp. 239 f. (Document dated April 12, 1265, end). Ibid. Here James says to Nahmanides: Quapropter nos la.

COHEN [32] version of the debate.118 If so, why did he wait nearly two years before publishing his account? And how explain the fact that when he did publish it, he acted not on his own initiative but at the behest of Peter of Castellnou, the Bishop of Gerona? Why did the cleric induce Nahmanides to disobey the strict orders presumably given him not to publish his version?119 Apparently, the Bishop of Gerona was unconcerned about the possible embarrassment of the Dominicans. Could he have wanted to contribute to that embarrassment? The bishops of Gerona could boast a history of discreet indiscretions. Twenty years earlier Brother Berenguer of Castellbisbal, bishop of Gerona and confessor to King James I, had offended the king, according to some, by revealing the details of the monarch's extra-marital adventures,120 according to others, by becoming involved in a nobles' plot,121 and was severely punished by having his tongue cut out to prevent any future lapsus linguae.linguae. Was the Bishop of Gerona in 1265 following his predecessor's footsteps? Again the question is difficult to answer, but the answer seems to be no. Both the Bishop of Gerona and Nahmanides emerged unscathed from this incident. There is even some question as to whether James really intended to impose the penalty he had announced for Nah manides, and a further question as to whether it was intended to bait the Dominicans into a protest that would lead to Nahmanides' com plete freedom. Even if the penalty were imposed, it would have cost Nahmanides little. His book, so long unwritten, would have been burned out of circulation but not removed from his mind, and while he would have been banished from Aragon, he could still remain on in the Iberian Peninsula and within a short period of time purchase the annulment of his exile. The only group that was hurt were the Dominicans, who were apparently vying for power with their erstwhile ally, James. This was already patent in James' decree of March 27, 1264, in which he appointed a Franciscan, Peter of Genoa (!), to the previously all 118 Schechter, op. cit., p. 107; Graetz, "Die Disputation des Bonastruc mit fra Pablo in Barcelona," Monatschrift fiir die Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Juden thums,thums, XIV (Breslau, 1865), p. 431. 119 Denifle, op. cit., loc. cit. Girbal, op. cit., p. 13, agrees with Villanueva, op. cit., p. 186, that the Bishop of Gerona wanted to have Nahmanides' report in writing so that it could better be refuted by the Catholics. If so, why did the Dominicans become so angry? 120 P. de Gayangos in the introduction to his edition of the Chronicle of James I of Aragon of Aragon (cf. above, n. 25), p. xxvii. 121 Balaguer, op. cit., pp. 444 f.</page><page sequence="33">[33] REFLECTIONS ON THE DISPUTATION OF BARCELONA 189 Dominican commission on censorship of Jewish books. It was also seen in a bull of Pope Clement IV, written to King James two or three years later, in which he expressed his consternation at the monarch's continuing to bestow public offices upon the Jews, his toleration of what he called their blasphemies against Christianity, and particularly his allowing Nahmanides to go unpunished.122 What happened then we do not know. Nahmanides soon left Spain and went to the Holy Land, where he arrived around 1267 and died shortly thereafter. There is no evidence that as a result of the Pope's message King James exiled Nahmanides from Aragon.123 It would be satisfying to believe that in light of the Pope's letter the venerable sage voluntarily exiled himself to avoid any demands for the punish ment of his people. It would be equally heartening to imagine that he left his beloved Catalonia with the blessing, if not the subvention, of his loyal friend, King James I. The story of the disputation does not end here. A further complication is introduced by the appearance for the first time, in connection with the publication of Nahmanides' account, of a Spanish name for the Ramban. Although every previous document, including the Latin protocol, refers to Nahmanides as Moses, Magister Judeus, or ben Nahman, and though, a decade and a half after the disputation, the PugioPugio Fidei calls him Moyses filius Nachman, the edict of James I dated April 12, 1265, speaks of the trial of Bonastrugus de Porta, Jewish Master of Gerona. Though there have been some scholars who have asserted that this Bonastrugus or Bonastruc de Porta and Nahmanides were two different individuals, and that there were there fore two disputations, the identity of the two, maintained by most scholars, cannot seriously be questioned.124 This, however, has only led to further confusion, for three royal documents exist, one dated May 29, 1264, and the others February 22, 1265, which deal with the reduction of the sentence of a certain 122 Denifle, op. cit., pp. 240 ff. (Document from Clement IV dated either 1266 or July 1267.) 123123 I agree with Kayserling that the words in Nahmanides' letter אני הגבר ראה עניי גליתי מעל שולחני הרחקתי אוהב ורע וכ"ל do not prove that he was exiled from Aragon.

COHEN [34] Astrug de Porta, "who in a controversy had said something insulting about Jesus Christ."125 Astrug, the brother of King James' renowned bailiff (bayle) Benveniste de Porta, had apparently been fined at least one-third of his estate and exiled from the king's domains or part of his domains. On May 29, 1264, he was residing at Villafranca del Panadés, a peaceful and pleasant town thirty-six miles from Barcelona, which was growing in population and in the affection of the king.126 On that day the king lifted Astrug's exile, and restated, or, more likely, limited his fine at one-third of his estate, interpreting most leniently which of his assets were to be considered his estate for the purpose of the penalty.127 The following February 22 James repeated the remission of the exile and decreed that Astrug was to pay twenty five hundred Barcelonese sueldos, this apparently in lieu of the heavier fine of one-third of his estate. On the same day the king granted Astrug safe conduct and announced a severe penalty for anyone interfering. This is just about all we know of Astrug de Porta,128 but it is enough to raise the question as to whether he and Bonastruc are the same person, Nahmanides. Certainly the details regarding Astrug supply the missing information for Nahmanides between the time of the debate and the publication of his account of the proceedings. Scholars have been loath to make the identification. They have been troubled by the difference in the spelling of the name. Yet the name Astrugus (with its variant forms Astruc, Astrug and Astruch) is identical with the name Bonastrugus (with its variant forms Bona struc, Bonastrug and Bonastruch).129 They have also pointed to the 125 The documents are paraphrased by Régné, op. cit., LXI, pp. 10, 18. 126 See Enciclopedia Universal Ilustrada LXVIII (Bilbao-Madrid-Barcelona, 1929?), pp. 1359 f. 127 .. . cum tercia parte uidelicet dictorum bonorum tuorum quam nobis ratione predicta retinemus ita quod solutis primo debitis que debebas die que uerbum illud dixisti et deductis inde primo similiter dotibus et sponsaliciis uxoris tue et uxorum filiarum (sic!) tuorum et etiam filie tue de residuo omnium bonorum predictorum mobilium et immobilium terciam partem habeamus ....

This, too, is easy to explain, because Villafranca del Panadés, a beautiful and peaceful town close to the court and the heart of King James, yet outside the boundaries of Catalonia, would have afforded a logical place for the exile of Nahmanides. The favorable site for his exile, as well as the gradual remission of Nahmanides' entire sentence, would accord well with what we have posited as the relationship between the king and Nahmanides in the disputation. Interestingly, the remis sion of Nahmanides' sentence would coincide with James' apparent struggle with the Dominicans, and would make it possible for Nah manides to return (safely!) to Gerona in time to write and publish his tract. The alternative to an identification of Astrug and Bonastruc is the assumption that around the same time in the realm of King James there were two Jews with nearly identical names who became involved in nearly identical discussions, who uttered nearly identical bias phemies against Jesus,130 and who were both punished by the king with what we would assume to be nearly identical punishments, but cannot know for sure, because when the documents speak of one they are amazingly silent about the other. The assumption of identity is at least simpler. What made the Disputation of Barcelona possible was the fact that rabbinic literature contained conflicting and contradictory views re regarding basic questions of theology. A detractor of Judaism like Paul Christian could thus seize upon an arbitrarily chosen set of such statements, not necessarily reflective of any norm in Judaism, but which could not be denied as valid within the Jewish tradition. The same text of the Talmud and other rabbinic writings could, of course, be invoked to defend against such charges. Paul's advantage, however, was twofold: On the intellectual side it lay in the fact that the con geries of quotations he had selected were often used by Nahmanides with the connotations Paul ascribed to them. On the institutional side, it lay in the fact that the texts and Paul's approach to them and M. Menéndez y Pelayo, Historia de los heterodoxos espanoles I (Madrid, 1956), p. 714, where it is given as Rabi-ben-Astruch de Porta. Loeb, op. cit., p. 6, calls Nahmanides Astrugus da Porta (cf. Roth, op. cit., p. 142). Régné, op. cit., p. 23, mentions an individual named Nastruc.

COHEN served the purpose of, and therefore received the backing of the elements that conceived and executed the plan of the Disputation. The Disputation of Barcelona made a deep impression in the history of the Jews. On the other hand, non-Jewish historians of Spain, even those of Catalonia and Aragon, have considered it of sufficiently little moment to pass over it without mention. Its relevance for Jewish history, however, would be minimal if it merely bore witness, as some seem to think, to a Cadmean intellectual victory by a Jewish scholar over a tyro in rabbinical lore. On the other hand, if the direction in which the text and context of the disputation seem to point be correct, its real significance lies in the sobering and useful realization that Jews in Aragon, as Jews elsewhere in all ages throughout history, have been regarded as an element in the political affairs of a country, and have been handled as such, not necessarily for their own hurt, but always for the benefit of the ruling power. And while their heroes have been men of learning, they have not been recluses, but men of practical wisdom as well, who often at great self-sacrifice have fought for their people whatever battle was asked of them, and fought nobly and well.</page></plain_text>
