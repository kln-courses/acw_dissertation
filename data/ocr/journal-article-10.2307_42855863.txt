I explore both the origins of these epistemologies and their ironical maintenance of a textual or social realism while dispensing with the natural realism of science. I argue that both scientific realism and standpoint epistemologies are in need of a new, recon- figured understanding of realism. Borrowing from the work of Steve Shapin, Niklas Luhmann and Stephan Fuchs, I contend that realism can best be viewed as an associational code which links people together into a scientific community and differentiates science from other forms of life. Without these codes, science becomes something entirely different. Key words', realism, science, standpoint epistemologies. Since the seventeenth century realist epistemology has served as the self- appointed steward of modern science. In this role it has been used to both navigate science around the spectres of relativism and perspectivism and to separate ideas and procedures that were compatible with scientific aims and objectives from those that were filled with the contaminating influences of superstition and self-interest (see Fuchs 1993). In short, realist epistemology has been used as an instrument to divide the 'the chaff of ideology from the wheat of knowledge' (Latour 1993:35). Today, however, such a view of the strategic role of epistemology in safeguarding the ontological boundaries and methodological purity of science has come under increasing attack. This attack has been instigated, at least in part, by a loose confederation of decon- structionists, feminist theorists, science studies practitioners and cultural theorists. These theorists, who are often grouped under the convenient label of postmodernists, question the possibility of ever grounding scientific knowledge in any firm absolutes, such as empirical methodology, Cartesian subjectivity or the perfection of language (Ward 1996).1 They reject the notion that scientific truth can ever transcend the local semantic practices, power dynamics, social hierarchies or cultural forms which shape it. Truth, therefore, is not a result of the unearthing and reporting of the already there, but always and forever a product of rhetoric, power and persuasion. Since all truth is thought of as an intricate amalgamation of text-making activities, rhetoric strategies and power configurations, postmodern theorists</page><page sequence="2">774 STEVEN WARD have given special attention to the localised sites or contingent perspectives where knowledge is crafted (see Rorty 1991). This move towards the local has led to the formation and proliferation of what are often called 'standpoint epistemologies'. Although these epistemologies vary considerably in scope, they generally contend that gender, ethnicity, culture, sexuality or some other group- or site-specific element of fact-production are ultimately responsible for both the form and content of knowledge (see Hartsock 1983; Collins 1985; Harding 1993). From this view, the cause of knowledge, or at least what comes to be classified as knowledge, is not the neutral voice of existing facts speaking through objective human scribes, but the constructive voice of culturally and historically situated knowledge interpreters and discursively constituted subjects. Standpoint epistemologists argue that all knowledge is localised perspective and all interpretations are mediated by and can be reduced to the linguistic or social characteristics of the groups which produce them. This being the case, the epistemological task contained within modern science of discovering a reality free from the contaminating distortions of per- spectivism and self-interest is severely misguided or, in many instances, even politically repressive. Consequently, the objective pursuit of reality and truth should either be abandoned or reconfigured always to begin with an under- standing of the influences of the cultural construction and transmission of knowledge.2 The result of these attacks on science has been the emergence of what are now often called the 'science wars' (or knowledge wars). In one corner, stands a loose coalition of science critics who contend that science is inextricably entwined with society and culture. As such, it is forever caught up within the politics, cultural representations and social hierarchies of time and place. In the other corner are the scientists and other realist supporters. They argue that the success of science is inexplicable without a recognition that scientific objective methodology, when applied correctly, does capture reality (see Leplin 1984). 3 The criticisms of science critics are but the cynical and jealous statements of disenchanted leftists who have now turned their socialist politics on science and rationality, or the meaningless jabber of self-absorbed human- ists (see Gross and Levitt 1994; Sokal 1996). In the first case, the 'painful bolus of postmodernism' (Gross and Levitt 1994:106) is merely part of a 'politically correct' attempt to dilute the basic moral and epistemic found- ations of Western society in order to promote a particular partisan agenda. In the second instance, it is but further evidence of 'an apparent decline in the standards of rigor in certain precincts of the academic humanities' (Sokal 1996:62). This paper is an examination of some of the origins of these so-called science wars between scientists and science critics. More specifically, it is an exploration of the influence of standpoint epistemologies on the objective status of scientific knowledge. My central purpose here is to outline some of the positions of these standpoint epistemologies and examine why their radical</page><page sequence="3">BEING OBJECTIVE ABOUT OBJECTIVITY 775 perspectivism is ultimately self-defeating. I argue that standpoint epistemo- logies fail because they, like most of their modernist counterparts, are caught up within the very 'spell of representation' which they attempt to dethrone (see Pickering 1994). As such, they may be said to adhere to an 'ironical epistemological vigilance' (Ward 1996:134). In this vigilance, modern epi- stemology is considered dead but nevertheless continues to shape the only options available for contemporary approaches to knowledge. In what follows, I first examine modern science's escape from locality and perspective as a central component of its more general demarcation of science from nonscience. Secondly, I explore the linkage between postmodern theory's 'democracy of representation' and the development and proliferation of standpoint epistemologies. Thirdly, I investigate some of the problems which haunt these postmodern inspired epistemologies, particularly their paradoxical dismissal of scientific realism while maintaining a type of textual or social realism. Finally, I examine how an associational realism, as opposed to epistemological or ontological versions of realism, may be an inevitable necessity for all those seeking to construct any type of truth claim about the world. Modern Science's Escape from Perspective Historically, scientific methodology has held the possibility of escaping local perspective and discovering universal truth. Advocates of early modern science and natural philosophy argued that past approaches to knowledge, such as those found in humanism, scholasticism, religion and everyday mythology, distorted and misrepresented the real world. Past knowledge producers had only ' dogmatize (d) on nature . . . either from self-conceit or arrogance and in the professorial style, have inflicted the greatest injury on philosophy and learning' (Bacon 1993:3). These approaches were guilty of exaggerating parochial or local knowledge into the universal. They lacked the ability to sort facts from values or locality from reality -to successfully separate their own experiences and beliefs from the actual nature of things. The 'earthy minds' of pre-scientific knowledge producers ignored any 'truth that would captivate or disturb them' (Locke 1975:715). Past knowledge producers were, therefore, guilty of 'parading . . . similitudes and sympathies of things that have no reality' (Bacon 1961:167). For advocates of early modern science, belief and perspective were factors which inhibited the growth of objective and universal knowledge. Knowledge that was locally produced was more likely to be tainted by the folklore of place, or what Bacon referred to as the 'the idols of the tribe'. This type of knowledge was often based on hearsay and legend. Bacon (1993:9) wrote: all the perceptions both of the senses and the mind bear reference to man and not to the universe, and the human mind resembles those uneven mirrors which impart</page><page sequence="4">776 STEVEN WARD their own properties to different objects, from which rays are emitted and distort and disfigure them. The lay mind mistook the apparitions of society or the tribe for truth. It interwove objects of nature, the subjective fantasies of the individual, and the mythologies of the tribe into one muddled explanatory framework. The know- ledge produced by such a confused epistemology extended only as far as the group and locality which blindly accepted its truthfulness. In addition to being tainted with the perspective and place of the observer, this local knowledge was also often deliberately misleading and politically self-serving. These local claims were often used as a calculated rhetorical strategy that 'distorts and discoloùrs the nature of things' (Bacon 1961:54). Advocates of early modern science argued that by imposing rigid methodo- logical procedures, empirical witnessing and instrumental correction, knowledge-making could be disciplined. This disciplining would, in turn, release knowledge from the social and personal idols which had long con- strained it. The disciplining of knowledge would eventually lead to the pro- duction of accurate, reliable and universal accounts of the world and its objects. Such a move would replace past approaches to knowledge which groped ťin the dark' with the guiding light of method (see Bacon 1961:413). In this approach the acquisition of knowledge was not to be left to haphazard techniques, group opinions or subjective viewpoints, but was to be controlled and corrected by the method, ontological attitude and institution of science and its collection of 'gentlemanly scholars' (see Shapin 1994; Rudwick 1985). Knowledge derived from past epistemological strategies was simply un- acceptable for advocates of early modern science. They asserted that in order for a claim to become truth it must show itself worthy through the process of experimentation. It must prove itself durable by being able to withstand the gaze of attending witnesses, the inquiry of replicating colleagues, and the intense scrutiny of the entire scientific community (see Shapin 1994). The legitimation of a truth claim required ťa corporation of scientific practitioners' rather than just the testimony of an individual patron (Biagioli 1993:357). As with a court trial, those truth claims which proved themselves sturdy and durable in front of the adjudicating scientists would ultimately decide the truth of the matter (see Shapiro 1983). In turn, it was only durable claims that were deserving of transcending the local and provisional to the level of the universal and true. Such a view required that those who produce scientific knowledge be of a special variety of mind or cognitive style. They had to be able to elevate them- selves above mundane reasoning and localised myths - to put away 'the depraved and deeply rooted habits of mind' (Bacon 1993:7). Such a new approach to knowledge seeking required a sustained scepticism - an enduring disbelief of received opinion until convinced by the empirical and logical power of the evidence or experiment. For advocates of the New Science, it</page><page sequence="5">BEING OBJECTIVE ABOUT OBJECTIVITY 777 was imperative to 'lay aside received opinions and notions . . . and refrain the mind for a time from the highest generalizations' (Bacon 1961:115). If this was done, the mind would, like a lens focusing on a distant object, correct its errant interpretations under the weight of experimental evidence. Nature would provide the truth of the matter if observers could only separate themselves from the prejudices of their surroundings. When combined, modern science's approaches to knowledge created an 'aperspectivism' (see Daston 1992:599). In this aperspectivism the agency of the individual observer disappeared to be replaced by objective accounts. This was done 'by letting the world select its own representations' (Fuchs n.d.) free from the contaminations of local knowledge and individual perspectives. Within this formula for knowledge there were no problems with represent- ation, society or other Baconian 'idols' - nature simply talked straight (see Latour 1987:100). Such an aperspectivism meant that scientific knowledge had no exact locality or place (see Shapin 1988) and scientists had no self- interest, perspective or cultural values, or at least must contain these in direct observation. Science's methods and truthfulness were not relegated to the laboratory site which produced it or the individual characteristics of the accumulated scholars who observed it - it transcended the politics of person and place. The truth products of science were, therefore, not the result of the peculiarities of one place (i.e., the idols of the tribe) or the idiosyncrasies of one person (i.e., the idols of the den) but the outcome of the concerted efforts and consensus of many places and people. As a consequence of these epistemic prescriptions, science could not (and cannot) accept the argument that a scientist's position, such as her or his ethnicity, geographical location, sexuality or gender, determines what she or he observes or the content of the knowledge she or he produces. These attri- butes were the material of localised myth and legend, not disciplined scientific investigation. They were attributes that had to be overcome in order to get on with first-hand observations of the real world. Postmodernism and the Democracy of Representation: The Theoretical Origins of Standpoint Epistemologies In the epistemological writings of advocates of early modern science on perspective and locality it is possible to see part of the larger boundary drawn between science and nonscience. In this division those who wished to know the real workings of the world were encouraged to adopt the method and ontological attitude of experimentalism. Those who wanted to engage in speculation and conjecture were sent away to the domain of the arts and humanities (and later, perhaps the social sciences). This boundary, while serving early modern science well, began to face its own sustained scepticism in the late nineteenth century. This scepticism began slowly to reintroduce the</page><page sequence="6">778 STEVEN WARD local and perspectivai in accounts of knowledge and paved the way for the popularisation of standpoint approaches to knowledge in the late twentieth century. The origins of contemporary standpoint epistemologies can be attributed to a number of different, but nevertheless convergent, theoretical sources, as well as to a number of new social movements.4 First among these is the Nietzschean and Foucauldian linkage of knowledge and power. Within this line of thought all knowledge making is seen as thoroughly saturated with politics. In Nietzsche's (1976:46-7) view, truth was to be seen as ťa mobile army of metaphors, metonyms and anthropomorphism . . . which have been enhanced, transposed and embellished poetically and rhetorically.' In another well-known quote, Nietzsche (1955:15) proclaimed that physics, the exemplar of scientific method and success, was 'only an interpretation of the universe and an arrangement of it (to suit us, if I may be so bold!) rather than a clarification'. Likewise, Foucault (1979:62) argued that knowledge seeking always 'permits and assures the exercise of power'. Knowledge making is a form of violence observers commit as they force their discourse and classi- fication schemes on objects and people (see Foucault 1972). From these positions, science and rationality are viewed as political tactics in a power game. Science's appeal to the rhetoric of reason, empiricism and logic is but a self-serving move to establish itself as the sole producer and guardian of knowledge (see Gross 1990). Those individuals or groups who can muster the power necessary to subdue epistemic enemies become the winners of knowledge wars and can establish their knowledge products and style as supreme. A second related source of standpoint epistemologies is found in the philosophical and literary deconstructionism associated with Jacques Derrida (1976) and other literary critics such as Paul deMan (1971) and Stanley Fish (1989). From this perspective, the thing we call reality is always mediated by, or, in stronger terms, actually formed by language and linguistic hierarchies. These linguistic hierarchies are essentially arbitrary. They do not reflect an absolute ordering of the world but a particular political and textual orient- ation. In deconstructionism, representation is and always will be provisional and contingent. Representation and representational hierarchies are deliberate rhetorical manoeuvres used to make an ordering appear more real and reflective of reality than it is capable of being. The end result of this deconstruction is that modern epistemology's division between fact and fiction quickly dissolves. The ontological hierarchies of modernity which neatly divided fact from fiction and the fantastic from the real are revealed to be products of a particular discursive arrangement of things to suit a specific purpose. In the end, we are only left with chains of signs or texts about reality rather than reality itself. Deconstructionism is a way of reading which allows one to view these artificial textual arrangements without correcting them. It is, consequendy, not a modernist 'hermeneutics of</page><page sequence="7">BEING OBJECTIVE ABOUT OBJECTIVITY 779 recovery' seeking further to clear the road to truth because the slipperiness of representation makes such a task futile (see Fish 1989). A third origin of standpoint epistemologies is in the constructivist view of knowledge often found in science and technology studies (STS). STS practi- tioners often advocate the adoption of a social realism to replace the scientific realism of science and modern epistemologa This social realism frequently looks to the specific social practices used by scientists to construct reality. For instance, in STS, scientific knowledge is often revealed to be local craft work performed by scientists as they go about their daily activities. From this view, scientists simply use the resources at their disposal to construct and defend a truth claim. These resources may include rhetoric, experimental hardware, citations from other authors and research objects, such as DNA or microbes (see Latour and Woolgar 1986). When assembled, these resources are used to elevate a claim above its competitors. For example, in one version of STS, actor-network theory, scientists are conceptualised as choreographers of human and nonhuman resources who simply assemble these heterogenous resources into a coherent and strong network. The strength of the network between people and things is ultimately what allows a claim to become true (see Latour 1987; 1988). STS practitioners conclude that nothing extraordinary is occurring in science. Like all other social realms and modes of life, science is doing what it deems necessary to proclaim and defend a state in the world. It is, like all work, a pragmatic and political strategy to transform chaos into order. Here, scientists are understood as neither 'Gods nor charlatans; they are merely experts, like every other expert on the political stage' (Collins and Pinch 1993:145). Finally, another important link to the formation of standpoint epistemo- logies can be found in the development and growth of feminist theory and, in particular, feminist critiques of science. In feminist critiques of science, science and its goal of objectivity are revealed to be a cover for masculinist assumptions posing as human universais. Scientists have ignored how gender politics and enculturation have shaped their own perception and interpret- ation. Scientific objectivity turns out to be but 'a male way of relating to the world' (Fee 1983:13). Objectivity serves as a strategy for dismissing and marginalising those claims which do not adhere to science's masculinist assumptions. It secretly relegates women, minorities and other politically disenfranchised groups to the margins of knowledge production where they are required to listen carefully as the patriarchal authority of scientific expertise makes pronouncements on their lives. The unique contributions to knowledge and truth and lived experiences of women and minorities are ignored in the name of scientific objectivity and value-free inquiry (see Harding 1986; 1991). The diverse theoretical sources described above attempt to deconstruct modern science's division between local and universal knowledge and special</page><page sequence="8">780 STEVEN WARD and ordinary knowledge producers. Standpoint epistemologists replace scientific realism's accent on the objective, the universal and the foundational with an emphasis on the perspective, the local and the contingent. For some, such a move allows for marginalised voices and other silenced perspectives to be raised to the epistemic level (or above) of professional science. In all the above approaches, science comes to be recognised as simply being another perspective employing various rhetorical devices of conviction; although certainly one backed by considerable power and status. Since all knowledge is now understood to be local, advocates of standpoint epistemologies contend that attention should be given both to the culturally situated perspective of the interpreter herself and to the general politics of knowledge production in society-at-large. In the first argument, gender, class and race are seen as forever imposing an 'inescapable limitation' on all thought (see Loughlin 1993:8). Here, the interpreter is seen as always being embedded within the culture, class, race and gender systems of a given society. As a result, her or his knowledge products invariably bear the mark of that social perspective. In addition to examining the context of interpretation, advocates of stand- point epistemologies contend that attention should be focused on the political strategies that are used by powerful groups to discredit or ignore the knowledge contributions of others. In this case, the construction of knowledge is seen as not just the outcome of an individual's social and cultural location in the epistemic landscape but also as the result of an individual's political position within society. The politics of knowledge of the larger society deter- mine which representations stand and which are relegated to the margins. Those within the nexus of societal power are more likely to have their knowledge products disseminated, accepted and raised to the holy level of truth. Those outside this nexus are labelled, 'primitive', 'ignorant' or 'mythical' and cast aside (see Ward 1995). Power produces a political economy of knowledge-production which, like a dual labour market, sorts people into either primary modes of fact production or secondary modes of myth production. It is the power dynamics of a society which ultimately determines who is in and who is out of the truth (see Foucault 1971). Such a view of the relationship between power, perspectivism and truth is applicable not just to the ordinary knowledge of everyday life but to all forms of knowledge, including the sacred claims of science. From this view, most of modern epistemology and science can be critiqued as racist, sexist, homo- phobic or Eurocentric. Science's claim objectively to represent the world as it exists is but a smoke-screen for its masculinist, heteronormal, racist or colonialist views and practices. The banner of scientific objectivity is but an ideological and rhetorical guise for science's will to control and dominate. The cries for scientific objectivity and the separation of fact and value and person and place have been used to mythologise and marginlise the knowledge contributions of women, gays and lesbians, non- Westerners and other dis-</page><page sequence="9">BEING OBJECTIVE ABOUT OBJECTIVITY 781 enfranchised groups. It has also been used to cover over the hermeneutical marks of science, thereby giving the impression that science is somehow above culture and politics. For advocates of standpoint epistemologies, culture is simply too strong and all encompassing to allow for any type of objective account, scientific or otherwise. The Epistemological Ironies of Being Objective About Objectivity A couple of important problems result when critiques of objectivity make the move from the humanities to the sciences. As long as critiques of knowledge are directed at 'cultural artifacts', such as Poe's short stories, Kant's moral philosophy or Lévi-Strauss 's field notes, deconstruction remains relatively unproblematic. As self-defined interpretative fields, philosophy, history and literary criticism have long recognised the importance of situatedness for hermeneutical inquiry and knowledge production. Even the social sciences, which sit at the intersection of humanistic and scientific styles of knowledge, usually accept the idea that society and culture are the prime determinants of knowledge production.5 However, once the deconstruction of objectivity is extended to science, a domain where objectivity has long been held not only as an epistemic virtue and goal but as a necessity, the war between realists and relativists, as well as the division between the humanities and sciences, begin to intensify. The central reason this change in tone and seriousness occurs when postmodern-inspired critiques make the move from the humanities to the sciences involves the epistemic difficulties and ironies of one domain reducing the other to its own realist and objectivist vocabulary. This is particularly problematic if that domain is, like the humanities, lower in the stratification system of knowledge production than the one it is attacking. Epistemo- logically, one of the central ironies created by the postmodern deconstruction of objectivity and the current turn towards standpoint epistemologies in the humanities and social sciences, is the problem created by second-order observations of science. In these observations the social world is often treated as real but the natural one is seen as 'a social construct' (see Collins 1981:217). Scientists construct fictions that can be deconstructed using the various tools of interpretative methodology; however, analysts of science produce facts about the cultural construction of science. Echoing this view, Karin Knorr-Cetina (1994:5) has argued that 'if science, and modern institutions in general, do not run on facts, this is no reason for despair and resignation - it is rather cause to investigate the ways in which these institutions, if they do not run on facts, run on fictions'. In this move, objective accounts of the true motives of science are, to be found in the second-order observations of those who critique science. Such a position, however, denies or ignores the obvious retort that the argument that science is</page><page sequence="10">782 STEVEN WARD constructed and ethnically or culturally situated is also, made from a perspective - one that ironically pretends that its views of objectivity are objective. Like in the Liar's Paradox, if knowledge is perspective and all truths local then so, too, must those very pronouncements be.6 In criticising objectivity wholesale, standpoint epistemologies call into question the ability of their own claims to be objective - that they, too, must appeal to evidence and certain standards of objectivity (see Fuchs n.d.). Standpoint epistemologies, like STS practitioners, present 'data to show how irrelevant data actually are' (Hull 1988:4; see also Laudan 1982). For example, in feminist critiques of science one finds a strong criticism of the gender politics contained within scientific rationality. Feminist critiques of science, however, also draw on rationality to make their claim about the engendered nature of rationality. Science's rationality is disclosed to be cold, objectifying power, but feminist rational reports of this rationality are ironically free from such distortions (see Harding 1992). This paradox is usually read by standpoint epistemologists as either an acquiescence to the hegemonic power of rationality (see Hekman 1990; Nicholson 1990) or as just another ironical 'postmodern predicament' (Lawson 1985). Standpoint epistemologies are also caught in another, somewhat related, paradox. On the one hand, they relish the democracy of representation and its celebration of multiple voices and experiences. They must, on the other hand, also contain those voices and experiences or they may splinter into thousands, if not millions, of 'mini-logues' (see O'Neil 1995). For example, in feminist standpoint epistemologies, the democracy of representation of postmodernism forces advocates to admit that much of American feminist thought has ignored the unique perspectives and experiences of African-American or Latina women. However, it also forces the recognition that the writings of African- American or Latina women may have neglected other social divisions, such as social class, sexual preference or regionally (Hekman 1997). As social categories become stacked on top of other social categories, the ability of feminist theorists to construct a truth claim about the status of women becomes virtually impossible (see Halberg 1989). As the social pie becomes divided ad infinitum , the tireless search for the infinitely reducible voice of the marginal other free from contaminating influences of 'symbolic violence' ultimately ends in radically subjective and forever incommensurable truth claims.7 The responses of standpoint epistemologists to their reflexive predicament involving realism and rationality have been anything but satisfying. Some have tried to reduce everything to a never-ending hermeneutics where all accounts, regardless of their origin, are recognised as symmetrical forms of commentary or even poetry (see Baudrillard 1988; Woolgar and Ashmore 1988; Ashmore 1989). Since meaning is forever unstable, it is unnecessary to play the repre- sentation game anymore. All observers are consequently free to experiment with their own strategies of writing or poetry. Others have held steadfast to the</page><page sequence="11">BEING OBJECTIVE ABOUT OBJECTIVITY 783 superiority of a social or textual realism to science's natural realism. Many in this camp have tried to show either how social or textual realism is more real than natural realism or have bracketed reflexivistic dilemmas and paradoxes in order to get on with the work of reporting the social and cultural determinants of knowledge. In the first option, society and culture are viewed as the truly causal realms. Nature is but a secondary derivation of the human imagination and, consequently, always bears the marks of society and culture. It is society with its class, gender and ethnic division that actually constitute reality. In some cases the inequalities of social hierarchies actually enhances the validity of truth claims for those at the margins of society (see Hartsock 1983). In the second option reflexive recognitions of the contradictions created by the objective dismissal of scientific objectivity is a distraction from doing analyses of science. The paradoxes of being objective about objectivity should be ignored in order to continue the important work of science and cultural studies. Much of the confusion created over the objective status of critiques of objectivity can be attributed to both science's and standpoint epistemologies' treatment of knowledge in an exclusively epistemological framework. Even science critics, who claim modern epistemology to be dead, still play within the parameters established by the modern episteme and its 'constitution of truth' (Latour 1993). Within these parameters, objectivity, realism, truth and reality are either possible or they are not. There can be no middle ground here: statements are either objective and free from the contamination of Baconian idols or forever tainted by perspective and locality. Consequently, both scientific realists and postmodern relativists can be said to display a type of 'ironical epistemological vigilance'. This vigilance leads postmodernists to abandon epistemology theoretically, but in practice reproduce it in the new, antithetical form of standpoint epistemologies (Ward 1996). What is needed is a different, less epistemologically based manner of conceptualising objectivity and realism. Is Realism Inevitable? The Importance of Trusting in Truth In A Social History of Truth (1994), Steve Shapin makes an argument for the historical connectedness of morality and knowledge; a link first systematically established in the early twentieth century by Emile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss (Durkheim and Mauss 1963; Durkheim 1983). Shapin's work, along with others, provides a blueprint for rethinking the epistemological treatment of knowledge much in evidence in the debate between standpoint epistemo- logists and scientific realists. Modern philosophy has long separated the disciplines of epistemology and ethics, thereby giving the impression that knowledge has little to do with morality and vice versa. However, Shapin's work outlines some of the</page><page sequence="12">784 STEVEN WARD conditions constructed in the seventeenth century that enabled knowledge producers to 'trust in truth'. Essentially, these conditions were not based on the epistemological prescriptions of natural philosophers but on the associ- ations and moral commitments formed among scientists. In Shapin's view, truth did not emerge simply because scientists finally developed a methodo- logy which allowed them to get things right, but because they established an encompassing and sustaining community of truth. This community was composed not only of members but the rules, mechanisms and associational codes that allowed for the establishment and extension of truth claims. What Shapin's account reveals, and perhaps it is one of the central lessons from the debate between scientific realists and standpoint epistemologists, is the inevitability of realism. However, this reconstituted realism is not the rosy version traditionally conceived and defended in philosophy, epistemology or scientific realism, nor the version now so maligned by standpoint epistemo- logists and postmodern theorists. Rather, it is best understood as an associational version. This associational version recognises realism as a particular code for organising the scientific enterprise. If the question, 'Is realism inevitable?' is asked within the confines of traditional epistemology, the answer is clearly ťNo'. Realism and relativism are both equally understandable responses to the modern and postmodern conditions of truth. Relativism merely reverses science's causal arrows between reality and representation and replaces the sacred terminology of science (e.g., rationality, objectivity, evidence and universality) with the holy lexicon of the humanities (e.g., perspective, indeterminacy, rhetoric, text and locality) (see Ward 1995). When seventeenth-century scientists and humanists constructed the boundary conventions between nature and culture and the universal and the local, they set loose two epistemic pathways which have now converged and find themselves in conflict (see Latour 1993; Ward 1996). On the one path, scientists began 'naturalising' everything by showing how objects and phenomena are products of a natural ordering of things. On the other path, cultural theorists began 'textualising' everything by showing how objects and phenomenon are products of a cultural ordering of things. Slowly these two paths have converged as each realm began to move into the other's domain, particularly with the expansion of science education and science studies in the 1980s. With this intrusion, the so-called science wars began, at least in their more recent version. Realism and relativism can never be discredited, however, because both are the product of the same epistemic framework - undo one and you undo the other. They are both part of the modern framework which attributes objects to either the orchestrated human realm of culture or the material nonhuman realm of nature (see Latour 1993). Like in all identity formation, the 'other' proves to be crucial for self- definition. If the question of the inevitability of realism is asked in the moral or associational terms outlined by Shapin, however, the answer must be 'Yes'.</page><page sequence="13">BEING OBJECTIVE ABOUT OBJECTIVITY 785 Realism appears to be a necessity for all groups who want to establish and defend a claim about the world, whether they are doing science or critiques of science. This is so because, in this more sociological version, realism is recog- nised as being a 'code of communication' (Luhmann 1989; Fuchs 1996) or, in more traditional terms, part of a 'collective representation' (Durkheim 1965). This code operates under the binary distinctions of true and false, objective and subjective, reality and relativity (see Luhmann 1989:76-83). It cannot help but assign objects to those distinctions if the group is to exist as a scientific community. If the code collapses or science begins to operate under new codes, it becomes something else - maybe something similar to politics, religion or poetry. Durkheim (1983:68) long ago argued that 'the pressure that truth is seen as exercising on the mind is itself a symbol that must be interpreted, even if we refuse to make of truth something absolute and extra-human.' Seen from this Durkheimian perspective, objectivity has nothing to do with reality or accurate or inaccurate representations. It is, instead, a key element in what Fuchs (n.d.) has referred to as the 'social structure of objectivity'. Objectivity is a mechanism which assures the co-ordination of cognitive and practical activi- ties. The distinction between objectivity and subjectivity or universal and local are part of the code that allows for the differentiation of science from other types of activities, such as religion and politics. What is this associational version of realism's role in both science and critiques of science? Firstly, it makes the world intelligible by standardising perception and action. In this regard, realism serves as a type of metalanguage that gives assurance that what one person is talking about is also what the other person is talking about. Like all codes, realism assigns names to objects and allows for the actualisation of meaning. It unites a loose amalgamation of people into a somewhat coherent scientific community. Realism also serves to fill in the gaps of communication making one understandable to the other members of the scientific community. Like Goffmanian interaction rituals in everyday life, realism provides the background of common assumptions which need not be explicitly communicated each time members interact. Secondly, realism generalises trust among members of the group. In this case, without some degree of agreement among people on the existence of truth and reality no one could trust the statements or motives of their colleagues. People could never be sure that a person is being earnest when talking about the world and its objects. Without the trust and moral commit- ment which realism generates, all social interaction and communication would break down under the weight of paranoid suspicion. Consequently, science would, like business arrangements and political alliances between nations, require austere contracts and treaties just to function (Fuchs 1996). This is why deconstructionists do not usually deconstruct deconstructionism and reflexivists do not 'go reflexive' on other people's reflexivity. A sustained and unrelenting scepticism, deconstructionism or reflexivity soon becomes rude. It</page><page sequence="14">786 STEVEN WARD violates the bonds of trust that link together those seeking to establish a knowledge claim.8 Sustained scepticism creates a suspicious spiral that keeps anyone from doing any work or trusting in the truth or anything else. Thirdly, realism serves to economise on social relations by simplifying the arrangements and interactions between members of the community. Since realism establishes the conviction that one's colleagues and acquaintances are believable and trustworthy, interaction between members can proceed more quickly and efficiently. If all claims about reality required thorough examina- tion by all members of the community before being accepted, no work would ever get done. For example, if in science each utterance of every scientist had to be officially scrutinised and sanctioned, no science would ever take place. Since realism steadies communication and extends trust to members of the community, it allows interaction and meaning to occur without undue restrictions. Finally, realism as a code of communication allows for a particular way of sorting and organising the relationship between subject and referent or human and nonhuman actants. In other social realms such as poetry and politics, humans are the only voices in the chorus. Although poetry may make refer- ence to the sky or a stream, it does so with the recognition that all such inspection is a creative part of the human imagination. Scientific realism, however, organises nonhuman actants in a very different way: it incorporates nonhumans as primary players in the construction of truth (see Callón 1986). Scientific realism serves as a particular way of dividing empirical labour, thereby allowing the objects of study to take part in the task of truth. This occurs regardless of whether one is doing objective science or objective critiques of science. The notorious separation of subject and object is perhaps epistemologically indefensible, but associationally it serves as another means for organising the world into a manageable and knowable entity. When combined, the above elements of realism constitute the associational mechanism of the community of science. What separates science from myth, religion and everyday common sense is not at all a matter of epistemological superiority. Nor is it a matter of postmodernism's antithetical argument that all discourse is symmetrical and that science is just another form of life. Rather, science is separated from other realms and communities by the unique codes it uses to organise itself and the world. In fact, these codes and this mechanism constitute the community of science. Those operating under these codes are doing science, those operating under others are doing something else. Of course, it might be possible for science to operate under other codes. It could become poetry-like, as Baudrillard (1988) and others seem to suggest, politics-like, as Foucauldians and feminist critics seem to want, or a hybridisa- tion of nature and culture, as Latour and other actor-network theorists desire. However, this means no more truth, objectivity or science. Doing science allows one to be relativistic about the observation of observation, but not</page><page sequence="15">BEING OBJECTIVE ABOUT OBJECTIVITY 787 about observation itself. While the codes of science certainly may resemble those used in poetry and religion, the use of realism and objectivity serve to differentiate them from those realms. The associational codes of science are different because they constitute a very specific way of accomplishing a particular type of knowledge. Conclusion : The Science Wars Revisited The current debates between scientific realists and standpoint epistemologists have become lost in epistemological platitudes. Both groups remain en- trenched within the vocabularies and political motives of their own unique epistemologies and anti-epistemologies. Each group slings barbs at the other side regarding which is more powerful, nature or society, or who is the holder of the really real realism. Part of the vehemence on both sides may be attributed to viewing realism, objectivity, truth and reality in epistemological terms rather than as associational codes. Such epistemological terms have blocked both scientific realists and standpoint epistemologists from enter- taining other, less contentious versions of realism. When science divided itself from prior forms of knowledge, it generated not just a distinct epistemology but also a discrete social form or associational code. Attacking the epistemo- logical positions of science certainly creates controversy but it does little to alter the associations or codes that make science unique. Such attacks and counterattacks are not very helpful in by-passing the ironies of realism or critiques of realism nor in determining how knowledge operates. Scientists may be able to subdue some of their perceived enemies by flexing their political muscle in academia, but they will never be able successfully to use their realist epistemology to completely silence critics. Nor will standpoint epistemologists be able to use their textual realism to discredit the scientists' realism. This is so because realist epistemology and antirealist standpoint epistemology are essentially flip-sides of the same argument. Arguably, what is needed is a conceptualisation of knowledge where epistemology is 'socialised' (see Fuller 1988; Schmitt 1994). Such a socialised epistemology allows for the existence of reconfigured realism. This reconfigured realism is understood to be both of the world and special. Notes 1. I am using the label 'postmodernist' as a term to capture the general rebellion against modern epistemology in its various forms. 2. There are some variations on this point. One group may be classified as weak textual relativists. They want to use insights from various critiques of science to strengthen the commitment to objectivity. Another group, which might be called strong textual relativists, seeks to use critiques of science as a platform to call for a new conceptualisation of knowledge making (see Fuchs and Ward 1994).</page><page sequence="16">788 STEVEN WARD 3. When realism is used in this paper, I am primarily referring to scientific realism. In brief, scientific realism assumes that scientific theories are the best explanations available for describing the way the world actually works. For a discussion of scientific realism, see Putnam (1975). 4. These sources are somewhat well known, however, it is important to situate them in the overall development of standpoint epistemologies. The genealogy of standpoint epistemologies can be exhaustive. Consequently, here I will focus on only a few of their more common theoretical variants. There are obviously more critiques than are being presented here, such as Queer theory, the critical theory of the Frankfurt School and hermeneutics. 5. This may explain why fields in the social sciences often suffer from a type of disciplinary identity crisis. Disciplines like sociology and anthropology are con- stantly in turmoil as they try to determine whether they are interpretative disciplines modelled after the humanities or fact-finding disciplines modelled after the sciences. It may also explain the vastly different methodological camps which have emerged within these disciplines. 6. Another option would be the development of the social study of science studies which analyses the fictions of science studies from the realist perspective of the social study of science studies. This, of course, illustrates the continual upward or downward spiral the epistemological dance between realism and relativism can take. 7. It appears that standpoint epistemologies allow for all types of variabilities or multiple voices; in fact, they often relish variability, except ironically in the domain they critique. For example, in post-colonialist studies it is often argued that much of travel, journalistic and social science writings contain certain rhetorical tropes associated with colonial domination (see Said 1983; Spurr 1994). These writings pretend to provide the correct means for representing the 'other' while in practice they produce only a Western characterisation and perspective. Yet, these examinations of the 'rhetoric of empire' themselves contain representations, this time representations of other people's represent- ations. 8. Granted this social process of trusting in reality is never free from conflict or competition; however, even these competitions and conflicts are tempered by the rules of realism or they become too great and a new community with new mechanisms is formed.
