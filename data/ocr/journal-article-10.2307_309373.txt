<plain_text><page sequence="1">IVOLGIN AND HOLBEIN: NON-CHRIST RISEN VS. CHRIST NON-RISEN Olga Meerson, Georgetown University The New Testament preaches Christ's message through the mouths of publi- cans (Matthew) and harlots (Mary Magdalene, the Samaritan Woman), thieves (the Wise Thief on the cross) and Christ's ex-persecutors (Paul). In Dostoevsky, the drunken Marmeladov also preaches the Kingdom of God, and Raskolnikov and Sonia, "a murderer and a harlot," are "brought to- gether by reading the Eternal Book" of the Gospel (VI:251-252).1 In one respect, however, Dostoevsky surpasses the Gospels in the inappropriate- ness of the bearers of Good News. He proclaims resurrection through a compulsive liar. The case in question is General Ivolgin in The Idiot. When Prince Myshkin asks General Ivolgin if the latter knew that Myshkin's father died while he was being tried, Ivolgin-apparently to comfort Myshkin2-tells the following story: "O, that was the Private Kolpakov case. Undoubtedly the Prince would have been acquitted." "Is that so? Do you know for sure?" the Prince asked with marked curiosity. "How else!"-exclaimed the General. The court was disbanded. Nothing was decided. The case is impossible! The case, one might say, is even mysterious. Staff-Captain Larionov, the company commander, dies. The Prince is temporarily appointed to carry out duties. Good. Private Kolpakov commits a theft-footwear from a buddy-and drinks it up. Good. The Prince-and note, in the presence of a sergeant-major and a corporal-dresses him down and threatens him with a cat-o-nine-tails. Very good. Kolpakov returns to the barracks, lies down on his bunk, and fifteen minutes later dies. Fine. But the case is unexpected. almost impossi- ble. One way or another, Kolpakov is buried. The Prince reports it, and then Kolpakov is crossed off the rolls. What could seem better? But exactly half a year later, at the brigade inspection, Private Kolpakov appears-as if nothing had happened-in the third company of the second battalion of the Novaia Zemlia (does he mean "New Earth?") infantry regiment of the very same brigade and the very same division!" (VIII:82-83).3 The subsequent reaction of the listeners invites the reader to participate in their genuine amazement: "What!" exclaimed the Prince, beside himself with amazement. "That is not so! That's a mistake!" Nina Aleksandrovna suddenly turned to him, looking at him almost in anguish. "Mon mari se trompe." SEEJ, Vol. 39, No. 2 (1995): p. 200-p. 213 200</page><page sequence="2">Ivolgin and Holbein: Non-Christ Risen vs. Christ Non-Risen 201 "But, my friend, se trompe, that's easy to say, but go solve a similar case yourself! Everyone was stumped. I would be the first to say "qu'on se trompe." But unfortunately, I was a witness and participated in the commission myself. All the confrontations in court showed that it was the very same, absolutely the very same Private Kolpakov, who half a year earlier had been buried with a regular parade and with a drumroll. The case is really rare, almost impossible, [. . .] the case, one might say, is even psychological . . ." (VIII:83). Ivolgin's definition of the "case" as psychological actually aims at shifting our attention from the motivation Dostoevsky may have had for incorporat- ing the Kolpakov story to the psychological motivation that a character like Ivolgin may have had for telling this story. Busy analyzing Ivolgin's psychol- ogy, the reader's conscious mind bypasses the message with which Dostoev- sky bombards his or her subconscious. Two aspects of this phenomenon need to be examined: first, how Ivolgin's psychobabble distracts the reader, and second, what Dostoevsky's message is. Ivolgin's Story as Means of Distraction. Ivolgin develops his story with so much elaboration and enthusiasm that we-the reader, Myshkin, and Nina Aleksandrovna-forget what prompted him to tell it: his desire to tell Myshkin something nice about his father, Myshkin Senior. At best we can rationalize Ivolgin's prattle as a confession of sorts, assuming that by saying "the case, one might say, is even psychological" [cnyxaii, MO)KHO CKa3aTb, Jlaxe nciHxoJIorHtecKH H-] he refers to his own clinical "case." After all, no one else's psychology has a bearing upon the story. If Larionov and Kolpakov ever existed outside of Ivolgin's mind, their deaths, and even Kolpakov's resurrection, would be factual, or counter-factual, but not "psychological." By calling the case psychological without specifying whose case it is (Leie clnyxaii?) Ivolgin tacitly admits that Larionov and Kolpakov, dead, alive, or risen, do not exist outside of this (i.e., his) "psychological case." Thus the "psychological" nature of the case prompts us to pay attention to Ivolgin's psychology. Dostoevsky's Message. The Importance of an Intertextual Precedent. While this story may indeed provoke an interesting interpretation of its psychological motivation-e.g., Ivolgin tells it to suppress his guilt and/or shame, as Deborah Martinsen demonstrates4-I am interested in its logical motivation, which is impeccable. Ivolgin tells the story to exonerate Myshkin's father. The General argues that if the victim's death is annulled- "unlikely" and "mysterious" as this outcome may seem-then the one who originally caused this death should be acquitted. The fact that the case is "unexpected, almost impossible, even psychological," does not affect the validity of Ivolgin's logic: the statement "If A then B" can be valid whether A is true or not. This formally valid logic enhances the readers' appreciation of Ivolgin's prattle but does not preclude them from treating it as such. Few</page><page sequence="3">202 Slavic and East European Journal readers even think about the case of a mistaken identity-that after all, it was not "absolutely the very same Private Kolpakov"-because the General asserts the existence of a realm of truth which adheres to the rules of formal logic, but transcends the limits of everyday human experience. He insists that the case is rare and almost impossible [peAKHIti, IlnoT HeBO3MO)KHbII]- i.e., statistically improbable rather than altogether impossible. By thus para- phrasing the concluding statement of Gogol's "Nose"-"No matter what anybody says, similar events happen in this world, rarely, but they happen,"5-Ivolgin suggests to the reader that there is or at least can be a precedent for applying his syllogism. If a victim's death is ever annulled then those to blame must be acquitted. This logic indeed has been applied in at least one other case, equally "impossible, even mysterious," but nonetheless believed by many more people than have believed in the story of Private Kolpakov. Ivolgin's logic is precisely that of Christ's redemptive sacrifice.6 By annulling death through His Resurrection Christ "clears" those who crucify Him, i.e., all the human race. The Christian message of redemption suggests an important function for Ivolgin's prattle. Christ's absence as the agent of Kolpakov's resurrec- tion and of Myshkin's father's acquittal is conspicuous-for Dostoevsky's purposes, not Ivolgin's. It is because of Christ's absence that Ivolgin's story sounds so absurd and irrelevant. By applying the logic of Christ's redemption to another case Ivolgin fails to convey the validity of this logic. The reason for the General's failure is not his logic but rather the fact that for Dostoevsky, who was consciously and unconsciously drenched in Biblical, liturgical, and other Orthodox teachings, Christ's case was unique. Orthodox doctrine holds that only Christ can provide an application for Ivolgin's logic because only Christ died for the purpose and with the effect of acquitting by His Crucifixion and Resurrection all human race, including, significantly, the immediate agents of His death.7 As Orthodox liturgical hymns assert, since Christ died for people's sins, every person in relation to Him is truly and actually what Ivolgin's Myshkin Senior is in relation to Kolpakov only allegedly: any sinner, living before, after, or during Christ's time on earth, is considered both an agent of His death and in need for His redemption: Thou hadst condemned us sinners with/to the curse of death, oh Life-Giver and Lord; but having suffered in Thy body oh sinless Master, Thou hadst brought to life the mortals who cry to Thee: remember us also in Thy Kingdom.

This feeling amounts to their awareness of being sinners, both against each other and against Him, i.e., of being His co-crucifiers. Significantly, Orthodox Church dedicates the first Sunday of the pre-Lenten period to the parable of the Pharisee and the Publican.9 The Church thereby insists that the very first prerequisite for preparing oneself to the participation in Christ's Crucifixion and Resurrec- tion is one's identification with the Publican, not the Pharisee. Even more pertinent to the subject of Christ's acquittal of His personal enemies are Christ's prayer for His crucifiers, offered on the Cross (Lk. 23:34), and the story of St. Paul's conversion which occurred precisely at the moment when Christ asked him why he persecuted Him (Acts 9:4-6). Those who do not feel responsible for Christ's death cannot feel any need for being redeemed by its annullment. In order to be acquitted, one first needs to be put in a position in relation to Christ analogous to Myshkin Senior's in relation to Kolpakov. Specifying the prerequisite of repentance for salvation, this idea is as important in the Orthodox Church as it is in Dostoevsky's poetics. Thus, instead of Christ's actual redemption Ivolgin presents a hypotheti- cal, artificial case, thereby modeling a situation where Christ's absence becomes conspicuous. While this model is the novelistic goal of the Gen- eral's story, its form is the absurd. The interdependence between this form and the function of modeling Christ's conspicuous absence is known in the Russian tradition under the name of iurodstvo, or "foolery for Christ." Recently Harriet Murav has systematically demonstrated the importance of iurodstvo as both a motif and a technique in Dostoevsky.10 In the chapter on The Idiot Murav states: Prince Myshkin's inexplicable behavior in the Epanchin's drawing room in Part IV becomes explicable as holy foolishness. The prince's numerous violations of decorum, not the least of which was the breaking of the precious Chinese vase, his message of resurrection and divine calling, delivered in an inappropriately rapturous state, and the response he produced in his listeners, some of whom look at him as if he were mad, are all characteristic of the spectacle reportedly staged by the medieval holy fools, and of the response they provoked in their spectators. An essential component of this spectacle was scandal, which is how the narrator describes Myshkin's behavior.11 Murav's characterization of Myshkin's behavior at various points in the novel is perfectly applicable to Ivolgin's story about Kolpakov. Like Myshkin, Ivolgin violates decorum by imposing his story on his listeners; his listeners, notably his wife, look at him as if he were mad; and last but not least, his scandalously absurd story is about resurrection. The differ- ence between Myshkin's holy foolishness and Ivolgin's buffoonery is that the former concerns Myshkin's behavior while the latter actually character- izes the way Ivolgin motivates, constructs and narrates his story. Myshkin's discourse on resurrection and national redemption, as well as his insightful comments about the thoughts, words, and feelings of his interlocutors, are</page><page sequence="5">204 Slavic and East European Journal rendered scandalous by such acts as the breaking of the Chinese vase. In Ivolgin's case, the very fact that his resurrection story pertains to Christ's message is scandalous. This type of iurodstvo or holy foolishness, the pertinence of the absurd to Christ's message, is very important in Dostoevsky's poetics. According to Murav, one of the reasons for which the narrative technique of iurodstvo attracts Dostoevsky is its importance for Christ's message itself, as testified by St. Paul: One of the first self-proclaimed "fools," St. Paul suggests the profound interrelationship between scandal and folly. In his letter to the Corinthians, Paul speaks of the cross as a folly to the nations and a skandalon, a stumbling block or offense, to the Jews. The Russian transla- tion gives iurodstvo for "folly" and soblazn, "temptation," for skandalon. [. . .] The practices of the holy fools, as reported in the hagiography, may be seen as a pale imitation of what is arguably the profoundly dualistic message of the cross, as Paul understands it.12 In the Russian version, the word iurodstvo is used in the following verses in Paul:13 For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish, foolishness [IopoxCTBo]14 but unto us which are saved, it is the power of God (1 Cor. 1:18) . .. For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness [IopOACTBOM / 6yAiCTBOM] of preaching to save them that believe (1 Cor. 1:21). What Murav calls profoundly dualistic may also be regarded as superficially dialogic. Two verses later, in the other passage to which Murav refers by citing the word "co6na3H" [skandalon in Greek], Paul talks about the message of the cross "polyphonically," assuming the points of view of the nations (the Gentiles) and of the Jews for polemical and apologetic purposes-much as Dostoevsky sometimes uses polyphonic discourse. Paul does present his own point of view, but only after the views of those "not called": We preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock [co6JIa3H /skandalon in Greek], and unto the Greeks foolishness [6e3yMHe]; but unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. Because the foolishness [HeMyxpoe / 6yee] of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men (1 Cor. 1:23-25). By contemplating the message of the cross "polyphonically," from the non- Christian perspectives of the Greeks and the Jews, Paul defamiliarizes15 the Christian vision of this message and thereby emotionally implicates the reader in it.16 Ivolgin also defamiliarizes this message-the message of the annulment of sins through Christ's annulment of death-by assuming the non- Christian view of resurrection, a hypothetical resurrection where Christ is absent but the logic of redemption remains intact. Paul preaches Christ's uniqueness: if He were not He, then both the Greeks and the Jews would have been right. Ivolgin also demonstrates Christ's uniqueness by showing</page><page sequence="6">Ivolgin and Holbein: Non-Christ Risen vs. Christ Non-Risen 205 how absurd resurrection and redemption seem without Christ. If Christ resurrected Kolpakov from the dead, the private's "case" would remain as impossible, but it would seem both less absurd and less intriguing. But Ivolgin does not claim Christ's intervention. He (and Dostoevsky) leaves it to us to recall the Gospel message where the logic of Kolpakov's "case" is indeed applicable. Thus Ivolgin's "Gospel" is apophatic insofar as Christ's absence in it is conspicuous. Besides the shockingly Christian logic of Ivolgin's argument for Myshkin's father's innocence, Ivolgin's story actually shares some narrative features of the Holy Scripture. Ivolgin calls himself a witness [cBaIeTenb] of Kolpakov's resurrection, "an affair impossible, one might say even mysterious." The General says: "I myself was a witness." The word "witness" reminds one of the apostles as the witnesses of Christ's resurrection, as depicted in Luke: "Thus it is written and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead on the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. And ye are witnesses to these things" [abI Ke CBIIeTeJn ceMy] (Luke 24:46-48). This passage sums up Ivolgin's logic: the apostles, the eyewitnesses of Christ's annulment of death, are commanded by Him to preach His Resurrection by first addressing the dwellers ofJerusalem. This means that the first reapers of the fruits of Christ's Resurrection would be the ones who had caused His death-just as Myshkin senior benefits from Kolpakov's resurrection which exonerates him from causing Kolpakov's death. Ivolgin says thrice that "the affair is almost impossible" and once agrees with his wife that it looks as if "on se trompe"-thereby recalling Paul's discourse on the message of the cross which I analyzed above. Paul main- tains that the Greeks and the Jews do have a reason to be tempted to say "qu'on se trompe," but that they are nonetheless wrong. Like Paul, Ivolgin suggests that if an event concerning resurrection and redemption seems impossible, this impression may enhance the uniqueness of this event, rather than undermining its validity. By using Paul's logic and rhetoric in Ivolgin's discourse Dostoevsky indirectly likens Ivolgin to the apostle. The writer has chosen Ivolgin, an obviously inadequate witness of resurrection, as deliberately as Christ had chosen St. Paul, the self-described "prema- turely born miscreant" (1 Cor. 15:8). In the first Chapter of Genesis, God approves His creation seven times, saying that "it was good" [OH xopom / 1KO ao6po in Gen. 1:4; aTO xopomo / SIKO xo6po/ao6pa in Gen. 1:8, 10, 12, 18, 21, and 25], and to culminate the approvals, in Gen. 1:31, "that it was very good" [xopomo BecbMa / ao6pa 3eno].17 Unlike God who creates the world, Ivolgin creates only fables;18 but like God, he creates out of nothing, and in steps. After each step in creating his story, he says "it is good" (xopomo) or a version thereof. Although Ivolgin approves the events concerning Kolpakov's death only</page><page sequence="7">206 Slavic and East European Journal (and the first of these approved events is Larionov's death), the General compensates for the quantitative deficiency with superlative forms of "good": "good" [xopomo] (twice)-"very good" [oIeHb xopomo]-"fine/ most beautiful" [rnpeKpacHo]-and finally, "what could be better?" [tiero 6bi Iysqme?]. Ivolgin uses superlatives three times out of five, while the narrator of Creation uses it only once in seven times, the last time: xopomo BecbMa / ao6pa seno, in Gen. 1:31. The approval of Kolpakov's death in Biblical terms may at first seem blasphemous because it sounds ironic or automatic: "xopomo," in this context, may be translated as "OK." Neither the irony nor the automaticity, however, annul the Gospel connotations of this "approval" of death, which, in the Gospels, is aimed at revealing God's purposes. After all, in English the Friday of the Crucifixion is called Good Friday. One is also reminded of Christ's "approval" of Lazarus' death at Lazarus' resurrection-a passage central to the questions of faith in Crime and Punishment, which Dostoevsky wrote immediately before The Idiot. Although He will weep at Lazarus' grave (Jn. 11:35), Jesus' first "approval" of Lazarus' ordeal seems similar to Ivolgin's loud approvals of Kolpakov's death: "This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby" (Jn. 11:4). If Christ were not able to raise Lazarus, this would have been a lie, for after these words Lazarus dies. Christ Himself tells that to His disciples in Jn. 11:14. The fact that Jesus actually loves Lazarus and raises him from the dead makes Ivolgin's approv- als of Kolpakov's death seem more acceptable. Like Jesus, Ivolgin praises the events leading to death because he foresees the eventual resurrection. Both the Christian message and Ivolgin's story stress the apparent im- probability of the resurrection in question and the necessary effort of faith in order to accept the message of resurrection. Ivolgin, however, claims to wish that he could join those who say "on se trompe," although he is merely aiming to emphasize the veracity of his story, or rather more pre- cisely, the fact that this veracity overpowers his reluctance to contradict his wife-whereas the Gospels emphasize that the witnesses of the highly "unlikely" event of Resurrection were extremely privileged and considered themselves to be so. Unlike the apostles, Ivolgin considers his mission of witnessing Kolpa- kov's resurrection to be a hard burden, rather than a privilege. He says "unfortunately, I was an eyewitness" [K HecxiacTbio]. The apostles pro- claimed the news of Christ's Resurrection which many were looking forward to-"unlikely and mysterious" as it was. It is evident from Ivolgin's reluc- tance to testify, however, that no person looks forward to Kolpakov's resur- rection. He rises so unexpectedly that Ivolgin seems to disapprove of his resurrection: "Kolpakov is crossed off the rolls. What could seem better? But[.. .]" In the light of the logical parallels between Ivolgin's story and the mes-</page><page sequence="8">Ivolgin and Holbein: Non-Christ Risen vs. Christ Non-Risen 207 sage of Christ's Resurrection, both Ivolgin's apparent disapproval of the Private's resurrection and other differences between the two discourses on resurrection should be considered functionally important and accounted for. Besides Ivolgin's proclaimed "reluctance" to testify about resurrection, these differences are the following: (1) The Gospels tell the story of Christ's Resurrection as an event of tremendous universal significance, whereas Ivolgin's story seems totally inconsequential. Even its immediate motivation (why Ivolgin tells it to Prince Myshkin junior) is not apparent at first. (2) Ivolgin's story is told in a comically marked dramatic (or "histori- cal") present tense-as if it were a somewhat scandalous anecdote. The Gospels-although equally "scandalous," as the above quoted point from Paul indicates-are associated with the past tense which presupposes that the events had significant implications for all the times to follow. Ironi- cally, the ontological aspect is played down in Ivolgin's ahistorical tense treatment, while this aspect is emphasized in the Gospels where the past is used to create a sense of tremendous historical implications of the events which interfere in history rather than constituting an organic part of it. (3) Christ Himself, both as agent and object of resurrection, is absent in Ivolgin's story. His absence may be considered conspicuous because it leaves a marked gap in the motivation of the plot: it remains awkwardly unclear why and how Kolpakov rises. He appears as a "resurrectus ex machina" of sorts. These features suggest that compared to the Gospels, Ivolgin's story treats the logic of the Gospel message of redemption with deliberate me- chanicity, intentionally depriving it of the elements of passion and compas- sion. It is as if God's mercy resulting in expiation were a matter of what Thomas Aquinas calls "effect," rather than what he says St. John of Damas- cus called "affect." As Julia Kristeva notes in relation to the notion of mercy in Dostoevsky, As to mercy itself, [Aquinas] does not fail to mention the very anthropomorphic, and there- fore psychological opinion of John Damascene, who said, "mercy is a sort of sorrow." Aquinas dissociates himself from that opinion; he deems, "Above all is mercy to be attributed to God, nevertheless in its effect, not in the affect of feeling." "To feel sad about another's misery is no attribute of God, but to drive it out is supremely his, and by misery we mean any sort of defect." By remedying the defect with perfection in mind, mercy would be a donation.19 Insofar as these categories are applicable to Dostoevsky's poetics of mercy, Ivolgin's story tells of the divine rather than the human aspect of Christ's redemptive sacrifice. Ironically, the General's irresponsible prattle lacks the human rather than the divine aspect of the Christian message. The effect is present, while the affect-passion and compassion-is missing. Ivolgin's "Gospel" is less human than Christ's redemptive message be-</page><page sequence="9">208 Slavic and East European Journal cause, as Nicholas Berdiaev said, "the human being is inhuman. God is human. "20 The emotional, "human" elements absent in Ivolgin's gospel are, how- ever, markedly present in another discourse on Christ in The Idiot-the one involving a copy of Hans Holbein's "Dead Christ" (1521). In his de- scription of the painting Ippolit emphasizes the presence of the human and the absence of the divine in the features of Holbein's Christ: This picture depicts Christ immediately after His deposition from the cross. Painters, it seems to me, have taken after the fad [o6bIKHOBeHHO nOBaJ4JIH4cb] of depicting Christ, both on the cross and off it, still retaining a trace of uncommon beauty in [His] countenance; they seek to preserve His beauty even at the moments of the most horrible torments. In the picture [I saw at] Rogozhin's, however, there is not a single word about beauty [o KpacoTe H cIoBa HeT: Ippolit's expression, if only metaphorically, emphasizes the verbal representation of beauty]; this is only the corpse of a man who endured infinite suffering even before the cross: the wounds, the tortures, being hit by the guards, being hit by people, when he carried on himself the cross and fell under its weight-and finally the torture on the cross, which went on for six hours (accord- ing to my calculation). Of course, this is the face of a man who has just been taken off the cross; it has preserved many lively, warm features; nothing has been calcified yet, so that the face of the dead man appears as if he still felt suffering [. . .] But the face has not been spared at all. There is nothing but nature in it, and indeed, the corpse of any man after such torments would look like this, no matter who he is [KTO 6bI OH HHI 6bIn] (VIII: 338-339). Ippolit then says that this intense depiction of Nature's devastating effects may provoke one to doubt the possibility of any.effects of Grace; that Holbein's depiction of Christ's purely human suffering tempts the viewer to deny His divinity and omnipotence (idem). In the conversation between Myshkin and Rogozhin at Rogozhin's, as in Ippolit's description of the "Dead Christ" painting, Dostoevsky uses Holbein's iconography to morally implicate the reader in the tempting experience of such purely human emotions as anguish, compassion and passionate doubts about the possibility of Christ's resurrection-the emo- tions and temptations of which Christ Himself partook.21 (The Orthodox Church defines God's voluntary partaking of human suffering and limita- tions as God's emptying Himself of divinity, the divine kenosis [6oxecT- BeHHoe HCTouRaHHie]). Myshkin says that looking at this Holbein "some may lose their faith," to which Rogozhin replies: "Mine is indeed fading away" [u TO, nporlaJaeT] (VIII: 181-182). As we have seen, in his confes- sion Ippolit attempts to account for this effect (VIII: 338-339). His com- passion for Holbein's Christ and his passionate disbelief in the possibility of this Christ's resurrection serve as the tragic counterpart of Ivolgin's comic lack of compassion for Kolpakov and his noisy yet passionless assertion of belief in the private's resurrection. In Holbein's Christ, pres- ent and discussed in Dostoevsky's text, the elements of resurrection and redemption are absent so conspicuously that both Ippolit and Myshkin mention their absence. Kristeva, at least implicitly, addresses the kenotic</page><page sequence="10">Ivolgin and Holbein: Non-Christ Risen vs. Christ Non-Risen 209 aspect of this absence: through the Holbein motif, Dostoevsky tries to implicate the reader in Christ's death as the ultimate sign of His human- ness.22 What is only implicit in Kristeva's analysis becomes explicit if one juxtaposes Holbein's Christ to Ivolgin's resurrection story which lacks the kenotic aspect. Other scholars have been intrigued by the grotesque and potentially blas- phemous effect of Holbein's "Dead Christ" in The Idiot, rather than by its representation of Christ's kenosis. Thus Robin F. Miller says that "the Holbein painting of the Dead Christ sows an evil seed" in Ippolit, and that Myshkin is immune to this seed only because he "can maintain his belief in the possible resurrection of beauty even in the face of such a painting" (emphasis mine, O.M.).23 Tatiana Goerner states that "[t]he Holbein carica- tures the image of Christ, for it depicts the mere surface truth of his death." 24 Both of these interpretations of the Holbein correspond to Robert L. Jack- son's view of the grotesque in Dostoevsky. According to Jackson, Dostoev- sky parodies the Christian revelation by depriving it of its metaphysical dimension. Discussing Dostoevsky's "Gambler" and "Bobok," Jackson maintains that Dostoevsky aims to discredit such a non-metaphysical world by carrying ad absurdum its "obsessive," "shallow realism, or what might be called an aesthetics of the void.'"25 While Jackson's observation is perfectly applicable to the caricaturing (though not the kenotic) aspect of the Holbein, this observation must be modified for Ivolgin's Kolpakov story. The General's story carries ad absur- dum not the human world deprived of its metaphysical dimension but rather the metaphysical world deprived of its human dimension. In the Holbein, the most horrible and absurd thing is the absence of the miracle of Christ's resurrection as God, while in the Kolpakov story the most absurd and horrible thing is the absence of any human and kenotic element. This function of the Kolpakov story is seen especially clearly when one contrasts its mechanicity to the emphasis on Christ's humanity and kenosis in the Holbein. Thus with respect to the Gospels as their common source, Ivolgin's story and the discussion of Holbein's "Dead Christ" in The Idiot present a comple- mentary distribution.26 The Gospel elements that each lacks are present in the other. Ivolgin's story lacks passion, compassion, and kenosis (the "af- fect"),27 while Holbein's Christ lacks resurrection and redemption (the "ef- fect"). What did Dostoevsky want to achieve with this complementary distri- bution? Apparently he wanted to provoke his reader to actively associate these two passages that need each other to complete the Christian message, which is both human and divine. This active association of the passages with each other would in turn make the reader complete the message of Christ's redemptive Resurrection. This activity implicates the reader both emotion- ally and morally, in the effort of faith and in the absurdity of forceful separa-</page><page sequence="11">210 Slavic and East European Journal tion between the metaphysical and the human-Dostoevsky's favorite way of affecting the reader's perception of both his novels and life. As Miller states, "Dostoevsky's reader is an implicated reader."28 Or, to put it in an- other scholar's terms, Dostoevsky often engages "not in communication but in manipulation."29 In Dostoevsky's aesthetics, "literature guides its readers by making them respond and by integrating their responses into the continu- ing literary experience."30 In the case of Ivolgin and Holbein, this experience results from correlating the messages of the two sources. Although the Holbein in The Idiot makes it especially clear that Ivolgin fails to testify to the reader about Christ, it makes it equally clear where Ivolgin succeeds: he provokes the reader to miss Christ, as both the Man of Sorrows and the only non-grotesque Resurrected and Resurrector. In fact, in The Idiot Dostoevsky uses both the Holbein and Myshkin's figure to apophatically demonstrate that Christ's divine nature is crucial for the success of Redemption. Although nearly perfect, Myshkin, unlike Christ, is only human, and therefore he fails in his redemptive mission-to the great sorrow of those who like The Idiot and to the triumphant arrogance of those who are annoyed by it. Apparently, Dostoevsky's ultimate goal was to make his reader miss Christ's kenosis in the Ivolgin passage and His divinity in both the Holbein and the figure of Myshkin. On Lazarus Saturday the Orthodox Church sings: "Before Thy Passion, Thou hadst raised Lazarus from the dead to affirm the general resurrection. Therefore like the youths bearing the signs of victory, we cry to Thee, the Conqueror of death: Hosanna in the highest; blessed is He who cometh in the name of the Lord."31 Kolpakov, like Lazarus, makes us think of Christ's ability to raise everybody from the dead, even before the passion, when Christ's own Resurrection seems to be "unlikely, almost impossible"--"one might say, even mysterious." NOTES 1 I cite Dostoevsky from the Academy edition in thirty volumes, designating the volume by the Roman numeral and the page by the Arabic. 2 On Ivolgin's benevolent motivation, cf. Robin Feuer Miller, Dostoevsky and The Idiot, Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press (1981), 174, also 175, 183 220 (on the benevolence of Ivolgin's other lies). 3 I am indebted to my colleague Deborah Martinsen for this translation and for the psycho- logical interpretation of Ivolgin's prattle. Cf. Martinsen, "Shame and Identity .. ." and "Something about Vranyo and Something More about General Ivolgin." 4 Cf. the reference above. 5 "KTO xITO HH rOBOpIH, a nogo6HbIe npocucmecTBHsI 6bIBaIT Ha CBeTe, pexjKo, Ho 6bIBaIOT" (Gogol', 77). 6 The emphasis on Christ's Redemption has been shared by all Christians since St. Paul. Orthodox liturgics abound with hymns dedicated to it. The most famous of these is the</page><page sequence="12">Ivolgin and Holbein: Non-Christ Risen vs. Christ Non-Risen 211 first prayer of the priest in St. John Chrysostom's Liturgy of Preparation: "Thou hast redeemed us from the curse of the Law by Thy precious blood" (HcKynHHJI HbI ec OT KJIITBbI 3aKOHHbIlI IeCTHOIO TBoeIo KpoBIIO), where "the curse of the Law" means that the Mosaic Law condemns (curses) anyone guilty of a prophet's and a righteous man's death. This "jump" from the abolition of death to acquittal for sins also emerges in many Orthodox hymns besides Chrysostom's prayer, notably in the Resurrectional Octoechos cycle. Orthodox Christians, therefore, identify with those who are responsible for Christ's death, and who need His Resurrection to be acquitted of this responsibility (the "curse"). 7 This function of Christ's redemption is especially relevant for the Christian discussion of the Jewish question, initiated by St. Paul in Chapter 11 of his Epistle to the Romans: "Because of [the Jews'] transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles" (Rom. 11:11). Among Orthodox theologians, Serge Bulgakov specifically maintains that Israel's guilt for Christ's Crucifixion provides the opportunity for the Jewish nation to benefit from His redemption, and to transmit this benefit to the rest of humanity: "The unique tragedy of Israel constitutes the path of salvation that is necessary both for [this nation] itself [. ..] and for the Gentiles" (Bulg., 108). What this Orthodox theologian holds to be true for the redemption of the Jews is true for the rest of humanity by extrapolation: both Salvation and the guilt for Christ's Crucifixion spread to all humankind through the Jews, Christ's immedi- ate neighbors, relatives, disciples, and crucifiers. Unless one partakes of the Jewish guilt for Christ's Crucifixion, one cannot partake of the benefits of His redemption. 8 The Resurrectional Octoechos cycle (including the fourth Sunday after Pascha), Sunday Liturgy Beatitude verses in tone 3, verse 4, cf.

With the exception of several non- canonical translations of various fragments, there has been only one Russian version of the Bible, the so-called Synodal version, known to Dostoevsky as it is known to today's reader. 14 Unless indicated, the word is the same in Russian and in Church Slavonic. Where they differ, the Church Slavonic always follows the Russian, as in IoPOAcTBo / 6yiHcTBO. 15 Of course, in Paul's time this vision was not as widely familiar as today, but it was familiar to those newly Christian Corinthians whom Paul addressed in his epistle. They needed a defamiliarization of this Christian message of the cross to better articulate their testimony to "the Greeks and the Jews." 16 I use the word "implicate" in the same sense as Robin Feuer Miller does in her The Brothers Karamazov: Worlds of the Novel. The term encompasses a wide range of effects with one common function: they all deprive the reader of any opportunity of detaching him/herself from the events and characters' interactions and mistakes depicted in the book. Sometimes the reader is involved emotionally or intellectually; at other times dialogically, but most often the reader is incriminated morally. The meaning of the word "implicate" depends on its application: in what the reader is implicated. 17 Although for the purposes of Ivolgin's style Russian is more important than Church Slavonic, I find it necessary to cite the Church Slavonic version for the sake of comparison. 18 For the discussion of Ivolgin's other lies, cf. Martinsen, and Miller (1981) 174, 175, 183, 220. 19 Julia Kristeva, Black Sun: Depression and Melancholia, translated by Leon S.

(on the non-metaphysical underworld in "Bobok"), 297 (on "obses- sive realism"). 26 Obviously, Ivolgin tells other lies, and The Idiot contains other passages about painting and aesthetics. On the former, cf., for example, Martinsen and Miller (1981) 174, 175, 183, 220; and on the latter, Goerner; also, Miller (1981) 267 n.12, and R. L. Jackson's Dostoevsky's Quest for Form: A Study of his Philosophy of Art. Both the Holbein and Ivolgin's Kolpakov story, however, stand out, for they create a complementary unity as regards Christ's redemption. 27 Although cf. Miller, idem. Miller believes that Ivolgin exonerates Myshkin's father to cheer Myshkin up while welcoming him as a guest, and in general, that in Ivolgin's stories, "the notes of truth ring out through the blur of lies" (ibid, 174). 28 Miller's emphasis.
