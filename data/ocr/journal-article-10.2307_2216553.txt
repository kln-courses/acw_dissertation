<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY VOL. 1. No. 4 JULY 1951 NICOLA1 HARTMANN'S ONTOLOGY Nicolai Hartmann, born 1882 in Riga, died on the ninth of October 1950 in Gottingen. Most of the following paper was written in the months pre- ceding his death. It therefore refers to him as to one still with us. In fact, it seems difficult to the writer to think of him otherwise.1 I THE SAFEST DOCTRINE The shock administered to German intellectual life by the First World War and its consequences, defeat, revolution, and the destruction of middle class property by inflation, proved a great stimulant. The twenties abounded in intellectual ventures resulting in a re-orientation of German philosophical thought. During this period the three philosophers still dominant in Germany to-day, Karl Jaspers, Martin Heidegger, and Nicolai Hartmann, defined their positions and constructed the doctrines which they are still in the 1Abbreviations: ARW Der Aufbau der realen Welt.

This triumvirate is far from presenting a unified front. But in spite of the disparity of their points of view their theories share certain characteristics accruing to them from a common experience. All three owe their initial impulse to a creative disturbance, the awareness of a fatal threat to our civilization. All three are animated by the conviction that the philosopher cannot be indifferent to the approaching cataclysm: if something is foul in the general state of things, he must discover the damage and help to remedy it by enlightening his contemporaries. They effect a revolution from academic Positivism, the philosophy regnant in the preceding era. In combating this adversary, the otherwise conflicting post-war or post-revolutionary philosophies march shoulder to shoulder. The German variety of pre-war academic Positivism was characterized by a pre-occupation with the problems of method. As methodology, phil- osophy tended to become an ancilla scientiarum. Metaphysics was supplanted by epistemology, and the approach to the problem of knowledge was largely determined by Kant's transcendental idealism interpreted along neo-Kantian lines. The revolt against Positivism was to restore to philosophy its vital significance, and it could do so only by rescuing from oblivion two funda- mental data: Man himself, long neglected in favour of an epistemological robot, the 'subject of knowledge', and Reality or Being, eclipsed in neo- Kantian thought by a substitute, the mental construct called 'object of science '. The three champions of this revolt divided among themselves the task at hand: Jaspers, interested in man as an individual, developed an existentialist philosophy which owed both its initial impulse and its basic concepts to Kierkegaard. Hartmann, stirred into philosophic productivity by the problem of Being, inaugurated a novel Ontology. Heidegger finally, trying to rediscover Being in the core of the Kierkegaardian individual, conceived his existentialist ontology. By assigning to Hartmann a place in the agitated intellectual life of his time we must avoid lending his work an interest which he himself holds in scorn. There is a good deal of drama, and even melodrama, in the exist- entialist writings. There is no drama whatsoever in Hartmann. The temper of his writings is cold, sober, analytic. They are void of both lyric and preaching. Any ascendency he has over the emotions of his readers is due to the breadth of his vision, the clean and far-flung lines of his distinctions and the sweeping vistas he opens. Though critical of Positivism and sharply opposed to its neo-Kantian version, he retains a goodly portion of the Posi- tivist heritage. He shares the Positivist's distaste for a philosophy that panders to the yearning after Weltanschauung. In Positivist style he likes to speak of his ' workshop ', and his philosophical ethos is that of the' worker '. He maps out a field of investigation and then starts his patient spadework, dividing and subdividing, painstakingly scrutinizing, one by one, the con- cepts he deals with, indefatigably refining upon his distinctions, and yet, through all his laborious plodding, never losing sight of the grand lineament which unites the logical minutiae into a comprehensive pattern. One may disagree with his principles, but it is hard not to admire his craftsmanship.</page><page sequence="3">NICOLAI HARTMANN S ONTOLOGY 291 There is in German philosophical literature a superfluity of first volumes never followed by second ones. Hartmann, too, is a man of ambitious projects. But he carries them out. The book in which he was first quite himself, the Metaphysik der Erkenntnis (1921), furnished the blueprint of a vast literary edifice which it then took him three decades to rear. This structure shows no marks of the catastrophic events which filled the period of its growth. In 1950 Hartmann can quote from his writings of the early twenties as expressing his present views, or he may republish these early works with only trifling alterations. The connoisseur will discover hesitations and changes of opinion on certain issues (and some of these changes are recognised as corrections of former errors by the author himself); a careful reader may also trace a slow shift of emphasis in the direction of greater affirmativeness. The r61e assigned to irrational elements of reality, limiting our knowledge, is more obtrusive in his earlier books. But these slight sinuosities only serve to throw into prominence the severe rectilinear design of his thought. Consistency is its prime virtue. Work can only be done within a context surpassing the individual worker and determining his effort as a contribution to a collective achievement. The wider context within which Hartmann wishes to place himself is the progress of philosophical knowledge in history. Here we notice another element of Positivism in his thought. The nineteenth century idea of progress finds little favour with contemporary German philosophers, and in regard to historical progress as a whole Hartmann is just as critical as the majority of his fellow-countrymen. But he believes in progress in philosophy-a progress, in his opinion, of a curiously covert sort. Hartmann is modern, Positivist, and decidedly post-Kantian in his rejection of the metaphysical systems of the past. These systems, he holds, are hybrid products. They are, he admits, specimens of genuine philosophy. They deal with real problems and provide real knowledge. But at the same time they minister to man's longing for salvation-a religious want which, to Hartmann's mind, is quite alien from the philosophical purpose. Under the pressure of the religious demand for finality the builders of systems claim to know more than can be known, with the result that instead of enduring philo- sophical knowledge they achieve only a short-lived Weltanschauung-a compound of truth and fancy, honest thinking and wishful thinking. It is incumbent on the disillusioned analyst, the modern philosopher, to purge philosophical tradition of its foreign ingredients. Thus he may detect the progress of insight hidden behind that disheartening spectacle which current books on the history of philosophy unfold: an aimless procession of compet- ing systems. Heeding the lesson of the past, we should resist the temptation of 'the system '. Its charms, harmony, balance, comprehensiveness, are inimical to truth. 'Problem thinking versus system thinking' is the motto of Hartmann's thought, formulated by him in the first programmatic account of his philosophical enterprise.2 Elements of system, Hartmann admits, 2Deutsche Systematische Philosophie nach ihren Gestaltern, ed. Hermann Schwarz, vol. I (Berlin 1931). Nicolai Hartmann, pp. 281-340, esp. 250-257,</page><page sequence="4">292 HELMUT KUHN are found in every philosophical enterprise, including his own. They are legitimate to the extent that they reflect the sytematic character of reality. Not the system as such, but the system as a construct must be avoided.3 Under the influence of Hegel and more recently of Dilthey, German philosophical thought has developed a keen sensitiveness to the organic unity of every philosophy regarded as the creation of both an individual mind and a particular moment of history. Hartmann sets little store by this historicist approach to history. With his idea of a covert progress of philosophical knowledge he feels free to choose, from among the elements of systems, whatever suits his purposes, and to discard the rest. So he is of all schools and of no one in particular. As an ontologist he is Aristotelian, though he has no use for teleology as an ontological principle. He is a Kantian who claims for himself the stupendous task of re-writing for our time a critique of pure reason (ARW III). But Kant's Coperican revolution he considers a misunderstanding. Anti-idealist though he is, he believes he carries on the work of the German idealists, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, by his own philosophy of the mind. Critical eclecticism seems a fitting name for Hartmann's attitude towards his predecessors. The principle of selection is afforded by a secular counterpart to the philosophia perennis, the con- ception of a perpetual, though generally unrecognised, Ontology growing through the centuries. Hartmann enjoys himself in the role of the tough- minded thinker pouring scorn on the tender-minded votaries of edifying philosophical creeds. Yet he propounds his own views with a subdued pathos, and occasionally intimations of a sense of mission slip from his pen. The foundation of philosophy is, according to him, the study of Being as Being, ' ontology '. Instead of this unfamiliar name he also uses the more resounding one of metaphysics. The very title of his first important book, Metaphysics of Knowledge, was intended as a challenge to those of his confreres who still fought shy of this obsolescent branch of study. More specifically it was the gauntlet thrown down to neo-Kantianism in whose stronghold, Marburg, Hartmann started his career. In the words of Christian Wolff, whom he regards as one of his forerunners, he might have written: Nos ontologiam a contemtu, quo laborat, vindicamus, sterili tractatione in foecundam conversa.4 But still, in 1948, after the general climate of opinion has changed in favour of ontology, he finds himself the contemporary of 'a generation that has lost the original sense of the problem of Being ' (GO X). He feels that he did what others were merely talking about. While they indulged in grandi- loquent rhetoric on an ontological movement and the advent of a new metaphysics, he quietly set to constructing his theory of 'Being as such '. In doing so he seemed at variance with the tendency of his time, though actually, at a deeper layer, he was in accord with its secret yearnings. Emerg- ing from a catastrophe and anticipating further disasters people felt : 'We live in a crumbling world. Nothing stable or safe is left us .' Hartmann 3ARW VIII-IX. This, incidentally, is one of the issues on which a shift of emphasis is to be noted: The anti-systematic bias of the early writings gradually disappears. 4Philosophia prima, sive Ontologia, editio nova (Frankfurt and Leipzig, 1736) p. 1,</page><page sequence="5">NICOLAI HARTMANN S ONTOLOGY 293 furnished the antithesis: he directed attention toward 'something safe', (/3ff/atv T), Being as such, upon which to found the 'safest doctrine' (pflatoTaT71) So0a).5 II BEING-ONE AND MANY What is this 'Being qua Being ', to be explored by a new philosophia prima ? What sort of argument can establish a concept of Being ? And what is the point in waxing eloquent on a theme which, as some may feel, is productive only of tautologies ? There is no definition of Being, and Hartmann does not try to provide one. But there are two marks of Being tacitly assumed rather than explicitly stated by him. In the first place, Being is 'being-by-itself' (Ansichsein). Though stated affirmatively this characteristic is actually a negative one. Being as such is independent Being-independent of its being thought, imagined, known, attended to or ignored; independent, more generally speaking, of man, his intellectual equipment, his faculties, hopes, fears, his love or hate. Being is what it is, and Hartmann strives to cleanse it from all anthropomorphisms. There is no 'meaning' of Being-Being makes no 'sense'. More precisely there is no sense in looking for anything like meaning in the field of ontology. For 'meaning' (Sinn) exists only within the ambit of human existence, and so the query itself is tainted by an unavowed anthropomorphism (GO 44-46). On this point Hartmann goes beyond what is involved in the notion of Ansich ' (per se). Reality might very well exist per se and yet conform to a pattern disclosing itself to man as ' meaningful '. There might be an innate mutual aptness and correspondence, a connaturalitas, in the relationship between man and Being as a whole. But Hartmann does not even seriously consider this possibility. Here is his unrecognised a piori, the parti pris of the post-Nietzschean philosopher and Positivist. Man, he feels, is confronted by an estranged reality, and Existentialists who expatiate on this alienation are mistaken not in regard to the facts but by the attitude they take towards them. They bemoan a simple datum as though it were the symptom of an extraordinary state of disgrace. Man's nobility, we are told, with an over- tone of manly resignation, consists in coming to terms with a world not designed for him (NW 69-70). We may expect that a concept of Being, completely divorced from man and human aspirations towards meaning, is condemned to vacuity. Being, thus negatively defined, seems undistinguishable from Nothing. Would it be correct to say that Being is Nothing ? Hartmann is far from accepting this Hegelian equation. His concept of Being grows concrete owing to a second mark which includes two inter-related features: Being is one, and it is structured. 'The methodical unity involved in the idea of the new philosophia prima consists in raising, in all fields of inquiry, the question: SCf. Aristotle, Metaphysics, 1008 a 16.</page><page sequence="6">294 HELMUT KUHN what is that which in regard to its being is here primary and fundamental ? This mode of interrogation, together with the resulting type of investigation, achieves the unity of its object-regardless of its being parcelled out among diverse regions and in spite of this. The unity of the object of a quest conducted in this manner is Being as such. The diversification, on the other hand, of this object into forms and modes of appearance provides the mani- fold of principles and categories of Being. Hence in the process of exposition ontology develops directly without any hiatus into a doctrine of categories' (GO 33). The interpretation of this momentous passage may be prefaced by a linguistic remark designed to remove an ambiguity. 'Being as such' in the above quotation stands for Seindes als solches, 'principles of Being ' for Seinsprinzipien. That is to say, one and the same English word, Being, in this case as throughout in this paper, renders two different forms of the German auxiliary verb: first, the substantive participle Seiendes which, more accurately translated, would read 'that which is', and second the infinitive Sein. Now Hartmann does distinguish between the two terms: Sein is to Seiendes, he explains, as 'truth is to the true, actuality to the actual, reality to the real' (GO 40). But this distinction, fundamental in Heidegger's ontology, is, on the whole, irrelevant to Hartmann's philosophical purpose. So I have deliberately neglected it in order to avoid the cumbersome reiteration of 'that which is ' as an equivalent of Seiendes. Being, Hartmann affirms, is one and many, a unity and a manifold. This manifold is not derived from the unity but it is 'given'. No special effort is needed to arrive at variety-it is the prima facie aspect of reality and the starting-point for every kind of inquiry. And the philosopher's approach to this variety of data is no different from that of man trying to orientate himself in life or of that of the scientist bringing a refined method of research to bear upon a small sector of reality. They all take note of 'that which is'. The philosopher, however, carries his attention to Being further than the ordinary man or the scientist does. He presses on toward a synoptic view of Being as such and in its entirety. Thus his range of vision is wider than that of the scientist. But he cannot ignore with impunity the scientist's findings. Like the scientist he is involved in an endless quest, and losing contact with the progress of science is, for the philosopher as Hartmann sees him, tantamount to losing contact with reality. The old metaphysics, from which Hartmann is anxious to distinguish his own undertaking, is 'metaphysics from above'. Starting from first principles it uses deduction as its chief method for arriving at the multiplicity of things. Hartmann, trying to rebuild metaphysics 'from below', rejects this method along with its fallacious basis : the belief that the principles of human thought are identical with the principles of Being. Swayed by this belief, Aristotle uses the law of contradiction as a criterion by which Being (ovria) is identified, and Wolff, carrying rationalism to its utmost con- clusions, erects his entire ontology on this principle. But the underlying identification is unjustified, Hartmann holds. On the same ground he</page><page sequence="7">NICOLAI HARTMANN S ONTOLOGY 295 takes issue with the neo-Kantians who substitute for the Being of meta- physics the object progressively constructed by science, while retaining both the old identification and much of the old deductive method-the two things belonging naturally together. We need not here raise the question whether or not Hartmann's account of Aristotle's method is an oversimplification. More relevant is the remark that Hartmann owes his alternative method to Phenomenology-a move- ment which took its inception with the publication of Edmund Husserl's Logische Untersuchungen (1900-1901) and became predominant in German thought during the twenties. Few publications appearing in the period failed to show the marks of Husserl's influence. Hartmann is among those indebted to this master of sensitive and patient philosophical analysis. With his motto ' Back to things themselves ' (Zuriick zu den Sachen) Husserl saved German philosophy from the atrophy it suffered under the dominance of neo-Kantian epistemology, and Hartmann's ontology is to be reckoned among the fruits of the new phenomenological open-mindedness. Hartmann's writings abound with references to Phenomenology, most of them critical and negative in spirit. In publishing his Metaphysik der Erkenntnis he inserts a chapter dealing at length with Phenomenology and marking the boundary that separates his ontological approach from the one inaugurated by Husserl (ME 106-124). In thus emphasising the disparity of views rather than their partial harmony, Hartmann is prompted by the basic concern of his philosophising. He wishes to throw into bold relief the status of Being as existing in and by itself, independent of acts of apprehen- sion and transcending the sphere of merely mental existence. Phenomen- ology, however, such as it is found in Husserl's later writings, beginning with the Ideen zu einer reinen Phdnomenologie und phainomenologischen Phil. osophie (1913) is a 'transcendental phenomenology ': it develops into a method of reflecting on mental acts in which objects are not only ' intended' (intentionale Akte) but 'constituted'. This use made of the scholastic concept of intentio, endangering the Ansich of Being, seems to Hartmann a surrender to idealist prejudices. Hence his severe strictures. It is never- theless true that his own philosophical attitude is largely shaped by pheno. menological influence. Instead of constructing abstract tables of the cate- gories, one must, he urges, discern them by 'lending an attentive ear' to reality (ablauschen is the German word, NW 11). His ethics is conceived as an attempt to cleanse man's vision, too long obstructed by metaphysical partiality, for a better discernment of the realm of values in its as yet un- discovered plenitude (E 14). The emphasis on unbiased receptivity is a phenomenological heritage. We return to the passage quoted above. Being as such reveals itself to the straightforward scrutiny of the objects of experience, provided that the searching glance is directed toward that which is ' primary and fundamental '. Experience not only offers a diversity but an orderly diversity-a structure. This structure is diversified in that it reveals traits of a more or less funda- mental character, Ontology differs from other branches of knowledge by</page><page sequence="8">296 HELMUT KUHN focusing on traits which are fundamental in all regions of experience. The criteria used by Hartmann to distinguish fundamental traits from traits not fundamental or less so are the familiar ones established by Plato and employed through centuries of philosophical tradition: universality and indispensability. First, that which is universal to a high degree is eminently fundamental, and Being, universal to the highest degree, is, by the same token, more fundamental than anything else. This superlative fundamental- ity is shared by the characteristics (' principles and categories') which are inseparable from Being, such as oneness and diversity, harmony and antag- onism, substratum and relation, and others (enumerated NW 51-52). In the second place, that is fundamental which is indispensable with reference to something else. In this sense the things less fundamental are 'based upon' the fundamental ones which afford the conditio sine qua non. Which of the two interrelated elements is the more fundamental one, A or B ? Suppose A be deleted, could there still be B ? If the deletion of A involves that of B, the converse not being true, then A is more fundamental than B. So number is more fundamental than body, for by deleting numerability I must needs delete bodily existence too, whereas with all bodies destroyed there still remain numerable entities, e.g. ideas. As our illustration shows, the knowledge of the order of the 'more or less fundamental' is neither the result of cumulative experiences nor can it be called in question by future experiences. It is attained by the intuitive awareness of 'an essential feature with no regard to its being materialised in an actual case' (ME 50). It is, however, not the 'essential feature' nor a category as such that should be called a priori. This predicate belongs in epistemology. 'Cognitions alone can be a priori, not forms of being ' (NW 71). Ontology as conceived by Hartmann proceeds by apperceptions a priori, and the claim to a priori insight, coupled with the repudiation of deduction, is again typical of Phenomenology. The Kantian view, limiting the a priori to those elements of knowledge which spring from the cognitive spontaneity of the mind, is rejected by Hartmann as the 7rptTov ,E8os of idealist epistemology (ME 154-156). Multiplicity, then, is a primary datum for ontology. In the passage before us Hartmann speaks of the diversification of its object into 'forms and modes of appearance' (Erscheinungsweisen). Appearance, in this context, must not be understood to signify the phenomenon as distinguished from the noumenon or thing in itself (Ding an sich). This dichotomy is counted by Hartmann among the antiquated paraphernalia of a 'dogmatic metaphysics ' which first projects universals as ' essences ' into a supernatural realm, and then endows them with a power adequate to their lofty station. 'L'ontologie sera la description du phenomgne d'etre tel qu'il se manifeste', Jean-Paul Sartre writes (L'Etre et le Neant, Paris 1943, p. 14), and Hartmann might appropriate this typically phenomenological assertion. For him too Erscheinung is simply Being as it manifests itself. Far from raising uni- versals to a rank of superior reality, he blames the old ontology for placing an exaggerated trust in them - It is true, principles (that which is 'primary</page><page sequence="9">NICOLAI HARTMANN'S ONTOLOGY 297 and fundamental ') are known by their universality. But while all principles are universal, not all universals are principles. There is also a 'peripheral universality' (NW 9) which must be guarded against in ontology. The decision as to whether a true principle is grasped can only be reached by an impartial inspection of reality. Being, as our passage affirms, is one and many. But it is the many that carries the palm in Hartmann's thought. His philosophy is an unavowed pluralism. Occasionally the aversion to unity (that unity which, in Hart- mann's mind, goes with the 'constructed system ') declares itself openly. 'The ontological primacy of unity is at bottom a rationalist prejudice ', he writes (GO 59). Yet Being, as distinguished from being things, (Sein as distinguished from Seiendes) must be one. How else could we speak of it or inquire into its nature ? Curiously departing from his general mode of speech and thought, Hartmann refers to this unity as 'achieved' (zusam- mengeschlossen) by a unifying ' manner of interrogation ' or 'type of investi- gation '. This sounds as though the unity of Being were to be conceived along neo-Kantian lines as established by synthesising acts of the mind rather than as existing per se-a most revealing departure. Is it not true that Hartmann with all his stupendous labours attains to a negative ontology only ? The one predicate ascribed by him to Being is its being independent of human thought. Otherwise he deals with Being not as such but as broken up into modes and categories. The question as to how these modes and categories relate to, or spring from, Being, i.e. the ontological problem proper, is not even raised. This is why the array of subtly distinguished forms, types, strata, modes, with which Hartmann confronts the reader leaves us with the impression of an ingenious catalogue rather than a vision of reality. The ontological problem, Hartmann holds, is latent in philosophical thought throughout. Philosophies in which this problem, unrecognised as such, is solved only by implication he calls 'unfounded', reserving the title of 'founded' systems to a thought animated by the awareness of the onto- logical problem (NW 4-5). In the last analysis his own thought has only a doubtful claim to the title of a 'founded philosophy'. Hartmann has little patience with contemporary existentialist nihilism-with Heidegger, Sartre, Camus, and the rest of them. In fact no greater contrast to the aloofness of his own analysis can be imagined than the display of existentialist passion. Yet the obvious disparity conceals a deep-seated affinity. On a more careful inspection Hartmann's Being, void as it is of meaning and even of unity, bears a resemblance to the existentialist's Nothingness. But, unlike the existentialists, Hartmann is not moved to despair by his vision, nor is he disturbed by anxiety about the lack of foundations upon which to base life and thought. His belief in science-and science for him, includes the science of Being, philosophy-is unshaken. It is the scientific quest, an infinite process, which, according to him 'gathers into unity' (schliesst zur Einheit zusammen) an otherwise scattered and elusive Being.</page><page sequence="10">298 HELMUT KUHN III KNOWLEDGE--A SECONDARY FACTOR Being as Being is independent of our knowledge of Being. This conviction permeates all strata of Hartmann's thought. It is arrived at and justified through a theory of knowledge. Significantly the long series of Hartmann's writings begins with a book on The Principles of a Metaphysics of Knowledge. The title is meant to have a paradoxical ring. At the time of its publication, the predominance of epistemology, established by the neo-Kantians, was challenged by an aspiration toward metaphysics. Hartmann adopts the cause of the rising movement without surrendering the concern for a clarifica- tion of the problem of knowledge. He remains faithful to the neo-Kantian tradition in regarding this concern as bound up with the ' scientific ' character of philosophy. So he comes to assign to his theory of knowledge a paradoxical task. In the idealist view (the view maintained in the neo-Kantian schools) Being is constituted by acts of knowledge. Hence the theory of knowledge rightly assumes the rank of a prima philosophia. This does not hold for Hartmann. He begins with a theory of knowledge, only to show that this theory does not belong at the beginning. His epistemology is calculated to depose epistemology from its usurped rank in favour of ontology. To oppose to idealist epistemology a realist one would be tantamount to replacing one metaphysical partiality with another. Hartmann, in the initial phase of his inquiry, wishes to operate on neutral ground, free from commitment to a standpoint, 'this side ' of the cleavage between Idealism and Realism. (ME 8, cf. ' Diesseits von Idealismus und Realismus. Ein Beitrag zur Scheidung des Geschichtlichen und tbergeschichtlichen in der Kantischen Philosophie ', Kant-Studien, v. XXIX, and separately, Berlin 1924). An impartial phenomenological survey of the fundamental data is to pave the way for a constructive theory. To conduct this survey the analyst must give up the rationalist prejudice along with the idealist one. Evidently the two belong together. If the rational order of Being derives from the creativity of the mind, the mind may be credited with the power of understanding both itself and its product. Hartmann, on the contrary, impresses upon us the preponderance of the irrational in all fields of experi- ence. Wrapped in darkness all around, we can only pick out certain infini- tesimally small segments of reality as with a search-light. By the ' irrational ' we are to understand both the non-logical (i.e. that which lacks 'ideal structure ' though it can be known as e.g. sensory qualities) and the unknow- able (which may have an ideal structure as e.g. the irrational in mathematics). The method answering to the all-pervasive irrationality in the object is dubbed 'aporetic'. It consists in a readiness to follow up all relevant observations and to draw conclusions from them regardless of contradictions which may arise between two or several results. Rather than trying to harmonise them by flimsily constructed theories, we should acknowledge the aporia and in default of a genuine solution abide by it. 'Aristotle's art of discussing problems without desiring to solve them by all means, that</page><page sequence="11">NICOLAI HARTMANN S ONTOLOGY 299 great art of aporetic which once reigned supreme in all fields of philosophy- we have nowadays completely forgotten it. We must learn it again from the bottom' (ME 8). In bringing to bear these general considerations on the problem of know- ledge Hartmann arrives at the startling result that 'reason too is to itself an irrational object. It is a finite sector of reality, suspended between two infinite irrationalities : the particular, the natural object of reason, on the one hand, and the principles, object of philosophical reflection, on the other' (ME 305). This is Kantianism turned upside down. Principles as such, Hartmann asserts, are no more rational than the particular to which they apply, and the 'conditions of Being' (Seinsbedingungen) are more irrational than the Being which depends upon them (ME 304). Evidently Hartmann's negative concept of Being-an Ansich divorced from meaning -involves an equally truncated concept of reason. Ontology must proceed in the dark light of a ratio irrationalis-one wonders with what hope of success. For this analysis of the cognitive process Hartmann adopts the conven- tional pattern of positivist epistemology. He sees the subject of knowledge confronted with the object and reflects on the relation obtaining between the two poles. In comprehending an object the subject (the knower) reaches, as it were, beyond his own sphere into the sphere of objectivity. Viewing the same process from the side of the object, we find the sphere of objectivity reaching into, or impinging upon, the subject. This bilateral relationship is, of course, irreversible. The object may be said to 'affect ' the subject, but the subject, in the act of obtaining knowledge of the object, does not ' affect' or in any way change the object. The whole point in the cognitive process consists in obtaining knowledge of the object such as it is by itself, independently of its being known. In every case the object is only a small sector of reality which, from the point of view of cognition, consists of two complementary elements: the ' objective ' and the 'transobjective '. The tiny ' court of objects ', sur- rounded by an infinite field of transobjective Being, is not confined by static boundaries (ME 204-205). The subject, engaged in the process of knowledge, is continuously extending these boundaries, transforming transobjective Being into an objiciendum, the objiciendum into an objectum. The process is an endless one, and there will always remain an infinite expanse of trans- objective Being. The transcendence of Being, however, does not consist in this its extensive inexhaustibility. It is rather an 'intensive' character- istic, and in order to detect it we need not have recourse to Being as trans- objective. It is just as manifest, or even more so, in that portion of Being which, in a sense, has been drawn into the sphere of the subject-in the object proper. The object as known by someone has become appropriated by the subject-it is now 'immanent ' in the sphere of the subject. But this appropriation deserves the name of knowledge only if, at the same time, the object is left intact, preserved in its being per se. Its transcendence must be spared.</page><page sequence="12">300 HELMUT KUHN But how can the object be immanent as well as transcendent ? This puzzle prompts the analyst to distinguish between the object-as-known, the representation or image of the object on the one hand, and the trans. cendent object on the other. The process of knowledge consists in the endeavour to assimilate the representation to its object. Only a knowledge that discloses truth about the object is knowledge proper, and truth, ascrib- able not to the transcendent object but only to its representation, consists precisely in the accord between representation and transcendent object (ME 56-57). This analysis of the process of knowledge is undoubtedly correct as far as it goes. But it fails to tackle the real problem, viz., the question as to how the transcendent object as transcendent can serve as a norm for our Vorstellungen, seeing that the latter, as 'immanent', belong to the totally different sphere of psychic acts. Hartmann, reminded of this difficulty, would probably reply that this is one of the marks of the above-mentioned irrationality of reason. At any rate, he feels entitled to construct upon his findings a theory which, passing beyond the initial neutrality, maintains a ' critical realism '. In affirming the transcendence of the object of knowledge as an existent per se we are not, Hartmann holds, setting up a theorem. We are simply expressing an Urphdnomen which is basic to every theory (ME 135). A theory of knowledge will have to interpret this natural 'affirmation of reality' (Realitdtsthese) but it can neither explain it away nor ignore it. In fact its ability to come to terms with this fundamental fact may be con- sidered the crucial test of its validity. In the ' naive view of the world ' this belief in reality is a priori, unquestioned and unshakable. Nor is there a breaking away from this conviction in the 'scientific view of the world' which is considered by Hartmann as the product of a gradual refinement of the ' naive ' or ' natural ' way of looking at things. A break and a reversal of the natural direction of thought takes place only in idealism : belief in reality is not dislodged (it is ineradicable) but robbed of its philosophical significance by a theory which gives the lie to common sense. Not so Hart- mann's philosophy, conceived as it is by its author as a science like other sciences. This philosophy accepts the Realitdtsthese of science by raising it to a higher level of consciousness. The realism arrived at in this manner appears to Hartmann a via media between two extremes: naive realism and idealism. Naive realism is right in believing that the representation or image (Erkenntnisbild) points towards reality. It is wrong in holding that the 'image' is congruous to the real thing of which it is the image. Con- versely the 'speculative' or idealist interpretation is wrong in subverting the ' affirmation of reality' (Realitdtsthese), right in being critical of the adequacy of the 'image '. Such is Hartmann's appraisal of his own point of view. The reader may have a different impression. The alleged mean will appear to him an extreme. For on closer scrutiny the dividing line as drawn by Hartmann between naive realism and his own 'critical' point of view disappears. There is</page><page sequence="13">NICOLAI HARTMANN'S ONTOLOGY 301 no realism so naive as not to admit varying degrees of inadequacy in the relationship between mental image and real thing. Hartmann's realism is actually a naive realism. Using a more characteristic expression we may describe it as 'massive' in contradistinction to the ' differentiated' realism as found, for example, in Aristotle. The fact that Aristotle himself was unacquainted with the specifically modern problem of' subjective idealism ' need not prevent us from asking him the question which underlies that prob- lem : do the things perceived and known by us exist independently of our perceiving and knowing them ? The Aristotelian answer must begin with a distinguo: they do potentially, they do not actually. The mind is the 'locus of forms' : only as perceived and thought do things attain to their full actuality. This answer is metaphysically meaningful because mind, in Aristotle's view, is not a 'subject ' related to an object as one pole to the other-mind is itself pure actuality, the summit of the hierarchical structure of reality. That knowledge itself must be regarded as part and parcel of reality as a whole-this is a truth to which Hartmann eagerly assents, and to this extent he is in agreement with traditional metaphysics. Accord- ing to him too the cognitive relationship between subject and object must be interpreted as an 'ontic' relationship intimately bound up with other structural features of reality. But in Hartmann's chart of reality, this particular occurrence, knowledge, does not occupy a place of supreme eminence or even of distinction. He goes far beyond Aristotelian realism in asserting : 'Ontologically knowledge is of secondary rank (ein onto- logisch sekunddres Gebilde). It is just one among many ontic relations (Seinsrelationen) and within that context it is secondary and dependent. For knowledge depends upon the being of object and subject; their being does not depend upon knowledge ' (ME 205-206). Mind and knowledge relegated to the periphery of the ontological field- this is another corollary of Hartmann's negative concept of Being. IV ONLY THE REAL IS POSSIBLE We remember once more a quotation commented on before (GO 33, cf. ?II above): Being reveals itself as both one and many. Since the multi- plicity of phenomena is indicative of a multiplicity of principles, 'ontology develops directly without any hiatus into a doctrine of categories'. The term ' category ' is used by Hartmann neither in the Aristotelian sense (types of predication) nor in the Kantian sense (Stammbegriffe des reinen Verstandes). Category, for him, is simply principle, and again principles are primarily principles of Being. Principles of knowledge are taken to be merely a special case of ontological principles. Being, as Hartmann sees it, branches out into a variety of basic traits, and it is these traits which confer upon an otherwise shapeless Being a certain physiognomy. Categorial analysis is a portrayal of the ' physiognomic structure ' of Being. A distinction is to be noted between 'modes of Being' and ' categories</page><page sequence="14">302 HELMUT KUHN of Being ', and accordingly between 'modal analysis' and ' categorial analysis'. But Hartmann's terminology is not strict on this point. Occas- ionally ' category' is used as the name of the class, of which ' mode ' and 'category' (in the narrower sense) are the species. The meaning of the distinction is nevertheless clear. The modes or 'types of modality '-Hart- mann thinks of the Kantian triad 'reality, possibility, necessity '-' are the most general and fundamental of the categories of both Being and the knowledge of Being' (MW VI). They furnish, so to speak, the colouring of Being, while the categories (in the narrower sense) are the determinants of its structure. They are 'constitutive principles' of Being. A further division follows. Among the 'categories '-from now on the word will be used in the narrower sense only-we distinguish: (a) 'fundamental cate- gories', which permeate all types of Being, as, e.g., unity and multiplicity, harmony and disharmony, substratum and relation (cf. the list, NW 249- 250); (b) categories defining 'types of Being' (Seinsweisen) of which there are two primary ones, ideal Being and real Being6, and the two derivative or secondary types, the logical sphere and the sphere of knowledge (MW 277); (c) categories diversifying a type of Being into a variety of strata. So real Being is a stratified whole, each layer being defined by a dominant category, spatio-material reality by the category of physical Being, or emotions, thoughts and the like by the category of psychical Being. And ideal Being is similarly stratified. This rough and by no means exhaustive classification of categories reveals the blueprint which underlies Hartmann's literary work. His major books form a clear logical sequence which partly coincides with their chrono- logical order. The foundation is laid in 1921 with Grundziiue einer Meta- physik der Erkenntnis: the analysis of knowledge shows that knowledge is secondary as compared with Being, and the programme of an ontology is enunciated. After an interval of thirteen years the ontology actually follows, divided into three volumes: (I) Zur Grundlegung der Ontologie (1934) deals with the problem of Being and its categorial diversification in general; (II) M6glichkeit und Wirklichkeit (1937), analyses the 'modes' of 'Being'; (III) Der Aufbau der Realen Welt. Grundriss der allgemeinen Kategorienlehre (1939) treats the categories and the corresponding types or spheres of Being, with special emphasis on the most important of these spheres, the Realsphdre. In Neue Wege der Ontologie (1942) the author, surveying the results of his ontological studies, succeeds in giving a total view of his philosophy within a short compass7. Finally there are the works dealing with special layers of reality: Ethik (1925) is devoted to man as a moral agent, and at the same time to the 'ideal being' of values; Das Problem des geistigen Seins (1932) to man as the subject of cultural activities 6Reality has been classified as a ' mode ' first, and reappears now as a type of Being. This difficulty is also in the German text, but it is covered up there by the untranslatable differentiation of terms: Wirklichkeit and wirklich denote the mode or modality, Realitit and real the type of Being. 7An English edition of this book (translated by Reinhard C, Kuhn) is about to be published by Henry Regnery, Chicago.</page><page sequence="15">NICOLAI HARTMANN S ONTOLOGY 303 such as they are studied by the Geisteswissenschaften; while Philosophie der Natur, Abriss der speziellen Kategorienlehre (1950), singles out for analysis the two bottom layers of reality, matter and organic life. 'The fundamental decisions in metaphysics at all times have been reached in the field of modality ' (MW VII), Hartmann writes. In fact, the spirit of his 'critical ontology' shows itself nowhere more clearly than in the way he treats the triune problem 'reality-possibility-necessity '. The concept of reality, Hartmann thinks, must be purged of its teleological admixtures. We must get rid of the idea of reality as the realization of a predelineated EcSos. What is left is sheer being as the 'being-there' (Dasein) of a thing occupying a place in the spatial-temporal world. For critical ontology, reality is, as it were, the mundane materialisation of that negatively defined Being in the sense of the pure per se (Ansich) with which we have become familiar. Everything else follows from that premise. There is first the concept of possibility. It is, to put it briefly, the Megarian con- cept as formulated in Diodorus's well-known KVPLEiVWV Xoyos. In the history of logic, Hartmann thinks, there is noticeable an undercurrent through which the Megarian view has held its own against the dominion of the Aristotelian schema of thought with its twin concepts of potency and actuality. Abelard, Hobbes, Friedrich Krause, and some others are quoted as witnesses (MW 188). ' Only that is possible which is real', and everything else is impossible (MW 14). This is the central thesis of Hartmann's doctrine of modality. At first blush this thesis seems to rob 'possibility' of every significance. But such is not Hartmann's intention. He merely wishes to relegate it to a plane of secondary importance-and necessity is to suffer the same sub- ordination. Accordingly a 'fundamental law of modality ' (modales Grund- gesetz) is enunciated as follows: 'Impossibility, possibility, and necessity are relative to reality and irreality. For this reason reality and irreality are the fundamental modes' (Fundamentalmodi, MW 71). In other words, both possibility and necessity, along with their negative counterparts, are 'derivative '-they are no 'pure modes' but limiting instances, something between modes and constitutive categories (MW 67). The 'relative' char- acter of possibility is readily grasped. Nothing is possible by itself-some- thing is called possible only with reference to other data or within a certain context. Given A and B, c is possible. Various frames of reference may serve as a basis upon which 'possibility' can be founded. Hartmann dis- tinguishes two main types of referential data, and accordingly, two types of possibility: essential possibility (Wesensmoglichkeit) and real possibility (Realmoiglichkeit, MW 52). The former may be instanced by triangular objects as rendered possible by triangularity. It makes perfectly good sense to say, things triangular are possible only because there is such a thing as the mathematical form of triangularity. But we inflate this meaning beyond recognition if we endow essential possibility with a ghostlike existence forming a halo of the merely possible around the nucleus of reality. This is what Leibniz does when he speaks of a plurality of 'possible worlds'. Essences, or essential forms, are ideal entities arrived at through a study of</page><page sequence="16">304 HELMUT KUHN reality. It is true that they form a peculiar sphere of Being. But the sphere of ideal Being is a 'secondary sphere', dependent upon reality (ARW 188- 189). A metaphysics which looks upon reality as a materialisation of one among many ideal possibilities reverses this relationship of dependence, Hartmann alleges, by ignoring the primacy of reality. Evidently a thing possible, in the sense of essential possibility, may very well be impossible in reality. The conditions required to produce it in the spatio-temporal process may not be present. What then is 'really possible ' i.e. possible in the sense of Realmrglichkeit ? Hartmann answers : 'That only is really possible in the strict sense whose conditions down to the last are fulfilled. As long as only one is lacking the thing is not possible but rather impossible. And the requirement of a fulfilment of all conditions means nothing less than the actual happening of the thing, its reality' (MW 50). We are back at the Megarian paradox: That which is really possible is not possible but real. In accepting this view Hartmann is at considerable pains to explain possibility in the sense implied by the concept of probability in modern physics; or that related possibility which forms the basis of all planning and deliberation. His attempt to interpret this 'partial possibility' (not all conditions but only some of them are taken into account) as a ' cognitive possibility' (Erkenntnism6glichkeit) combining with the temporal structure of reality can hardly be deemed successful. We have noted before that Hartmann's negative ontology fails to ask the basic questions. The problem as to how Being as one is related to the orderly multiplicity of existent things remains in the dark. Nor is any light shed on the temporality of Being as real Being. So it is not surprising that possibility also, intimately related as it is to these two questions, becomes a source of perplexity. The 'bareness ' of Hartmann's concept of Being refuses to unfold into the mean- ingful and rich structure of the world we know. We need not show in detail how 'necessity ', subjected to a parallel analysis, collapses in the same way in which 'possibility' does. Because of the relative character of necessity, the idea of 'real necessity' (Realnot- wendigkeit), applied to the whole of reality, obliterates itself (MW 91). Reality, the primary affirmative mode of Being, is neither possible nor impossible, neither necessary nor a product of chance-it is simply there. Acquiescence in its factuality is, according to Hartmann, the basis of all ontological inquiry. V THE STRATIFIED WORLD We proceed from the modes of Being to the categories-an advance, at the same time, from the one towards the many, from the universal and abstract toward the concrete and particular. 'In dealing with categories we are not concerned with the "being-there " (Dasein) of Being but rather with its being " such-and-such (Sosein). That is to say, we are no longer</page><page sequence="17">NICOLAI HARTMANN'S ONTOLOGY 305 considering modes of Being-for these are modifications of " being-there " -but shape, structure, and content' (ARW 15). The counterpart to the categories are 'types ' or 'spheres' of Being. Of the four spheres as dis- tinguished by Hartmann (cognitive, logical, ideal, real) the sphere of reality (Realitdt, not Wirklichkeit as in the preceding discussion) alone is 'funda- mental'. So the theory of categories, as worked out in the third volume of Hartmann's Ontology, centres in the idea of reality or the real world. Again this real world is viewed as a stratified whole so that the categories of boldest relief are those which determine the various strata or tiers of reality. They are responsible for the 'horizontal structure' of the world while its uniformity and 'vertical' cohesion is safeguarded by the 'funda- mental categories ' (cf. above p. 302). In a famous passage of the Republic, Plato illustrates the hierarchical order of reality by a vertical line divided into four sections (VI 509). With his idea of a stratified world Hartmann joins the long procession of those who, following the Platonic model, have in sundry ways developed the idea of Scales of Being. But though he retains the number four for his grand divisions, his total schema resembles the Aristotelian order rather than the Platonic ladder of perfection. Three main dividing lines give rise to four layers. The first bisection is roughly identical with the Cartesian dichotomy : cogitatio in the widest possible sense of the word, including feelings, emotions, sense-perceptions, in short, the entire inward life, forms one stratum, clearly marked off against extensio, the realm of bodily or external reality. Cogitatio is subdivided into spiritual life and psychic life, the former being characterised by the objective structures which it produces: religions, philosophies, works of art. A parallel subdivision of corporeal reality likewise results in two distinct strata: the world of animate things, and inanimate nature. Counting from the top downwards, we thus obtain four layers: spirit, psyche, organic bodies, inanimate bodies. Within each of these, further subdivisions of less significance can be made (ARW 195-200; NW 33-41). This pyramidal order of tiers or ranks of Being should not be confused with a classification of complex real structures such as man, table, tree, nation, and the like. Each one of these real beings participates in various layers, and its complexity presupposes their differentiation. Hartmann considers this feature to be the distinctive mark of his hierarchical order as compared to that of Aristotle (ARW 193, NW 53). Actually there is nothing more Aristotelian in his thinking than the idea of a sequence of telescoping forms. The recurrent metaphors such as scale, hierarchy, tier, and the like involve the distinction of 'higher' and 'lower '. The higher layer 'rests upon' the next lower one, the latter forming the indispensable though not the sufficient condition for its existence. No psychic life without organic bodies, no life without inanimate matter. There is throughout a unilateral dependence of the higher forms of Being upon the lower ones. This one- sided, irreversible dependence denotes, from the point of view of the real structures, an internal relation rather than an external one. Hartmann speaks of a 'law of recurrence ': the lower categories recur in the higher</page><page sequence="18">306 HELMUT KUHN ones as their elements (ARW 480). The laws of mechanics, for example, located as they are in the bottom layer, return or rather persist in the higher sphere of organic life. The lower forms are 'informed anew' (iiberformt) by the higher forms, and these possibly by the next higher forms-a situation familiar to every student of Aristotle. Not all structural features of the bottom layer, however, recur in the higher layers. Some features do permeate the entire ontological pyramid from the basis to the summit. These are time, process, and causality (NW 64). Others ' break off '. A characteristic example is space, which does not recur on the level of psychical and spiritual life. There is, Hartmann admits, only one case of pure tberformung, i.e. of the engrafting of a new and higher form upon the lower categorial structures, with the latter retained without any diminution : the superimposition of organic life upon inorganic matter (NW 64-65). But the fact that some, or rather most, of the structural traits dominant at the bottom level fail to recur higher up does not infringe the general rule of dependence. Structurally, spiritual life may be independent of material and organic reality. Existentially (in regard to its Dasein), it does depend upon the material substratum. 'We know spiritual life only as a "supported reality ", bound up with the consciousness of living individ- uals' (NW 66). Maintaining this law of dependence Hartmann does not profess materialism. Materialist metaphysics affirms the total structural dependence of the higher strata, thus reducing mental reality to a merely derivative existence. In spite of their existential dependence, the higher strata, in Hartmann's view, are no superstructure in the Marxist sense but enjoy a limited autonomy. The dependence of the spiritual upon the material does, however, preclude the existence of a deity, though this inference is not explicitly drawn. The law of dependence is counterbalanced in Hartmann's scheme by the 'principle of novelty '. Each one of the higher levels shows, compared with the lower one, novel features, i.e. structural peculiarities in no wise predetermined by categories located further down-an idea which may be regarded as a static version of Lloyd Morgan's principle of 'emergent evol- ution '. The counterpart to this emergence of novel traits is the 'breaking off ' of some categories prevalent in the lower spheres. Their disappearance higher up gives room for the effectiveness of new categories. So the non- material character of both psychical and spiritual life (or the 'breaking off ' of the categorial determinants of material reality) is a negative condition rendering possible the peculiar categorial structure of those higher types of reality. By thus establishing an equilibrium of polar elements-dependency of higher forms checked by their limited autonomy-Hartmann preserves his neutrality in the battle between materialists and spiritualists. The materialist errs by his failure critically to limit the scope of the principle of dependence. The spiritualist again exaggerates the autonomy of the higher sphere to the point of reversing the true order of dependence. The former has a narrow idea of experience, the latter is scornful of it and leans toward a deductive procedure. Both misconceive, and actually destroy the order</page><page sequence="19">NICOLAI HARTMANN S ONTOLOGY 307 of strata : one stratum is allowed to absorb the others. They develop into monisms, and their irreconcilability results from this their fundamental likeness. This is not to say that Hartmann avoids a metaphysical decision by taking refuge in pluralism. Rather his policy of balance applies also to the alternative of monism versus pluralism. Reality is one, despite the multiplicity of its layers. As layers they belong in one encompassing order. The ubiquity of the fundamental categories provides the bond of unity. Not monism as such but only false monisms are opposed by Hartmann. They arise whenever a set of ' regional' categories invades the other regions or strata and usurps dominance where actually it is an alien. Such en- croachments result in unbalanced views-in pseudo-monisms such as physi. calism, biologism, psychologism, sociologism, and the like. The oneness of reality must be recognised. But at the same time the philosopher, Hartmann insists, must be on his guard against its enticements. As history testifies, it tempts him again and again into rearing speculative edifices which achieve unity by oversimplification. In obviating this tendency Hartmann emphasizes the peculiar character distinguishing every ontological stratum from all others. The stratum is not only a region within unified Being but a coherent structure integrated by the two following 'laws of coherence ': ' (1) The categories of each stratum form a structural whole. They determine the real structure of their stratum jointly rather than singly. (2) The categories of each stratum imply each other so that where one occurs the others are necessarily interwoven with it' (NW 85). The recurrence of categories mentioned before strengthens the unity of Being. But the law of recurrence is qualified by the 'law of modification ' according to which every recurrent category is modified in conformity with the 'style' of the level at which it appears. Unity, for example, is found everywhere but it is not the same everywhere. The unity of the number one in mathe- matics differs from the unity of a material object, the unity of the latter from that of a process or an organic body, and again the body is one in a different sense from that in which a mental act or a concept is one (ARW 501). It is difficult to be neutral, and in the face of fundamental issues it is impossible. This truism is borne out by Hartmann's philosophy. Much though he desires to reduce the metaphysical ingredient of his doctrine to the lowest possible minimum, he too is compelled to take sides. We need not trouble ourselves with defining precisely where the real battle-front runs. In a general way this is clear enough. The representatives of the Platonic-Aristotelian tradition, of the philosophia perennis, of idealist, personalist, and theistic metaphysics apparently stand on one side, and they are opposed by a motley host of Atomists, Nominalists, Materialists, and Positivists. In this ytyavro/jaXta TEPt 7rsP ovlias Hartmann joins hands with the second party, and he does so by adopting Max Scheler's thesis of the 'weakness of the spirit '. Hartmann is reverently anxious not to curtail the prerogatives of the</page><page sequence="20">308 HELMUT KUHN mind and the dignity of man. This persistent endeavour endows his teaching with a high-minded nobility. It is true, he ranges himself with tough-minded rather than with tender-minded thinkers, and he likes to display an attitude of studied masculinity. But he is never coarse. The dignity of man is bound up with his freedom, and to assign freedom its proper place is a matter of serious concern to Hartmann. Its possibility, in his mind, links up with the idea of the limited autonomy of each stratum of Being viewed in its relation to the supporting stratum below it. Taken in the broad ' categorial ' sense, freedom is not peculiar to man but denotes a relationship obtaining between two ranks of Being at various levels-the relationship known to us under the name of the principle of novelty. The fact that at the level of biological reality determinants not presaged on the level of physical reality enter into play is just as astounding as the latitude granted to the human agent in the relationship to his own body. These two facts belong together; they illustrate, Hartmann holds, one and the same structural characteristic of reality. According to him most treatments of the problem of freedom in the sense of liberum arbitrium go wrong by isolating its human aspect. 'Categorial freedom is a prerequisite of moral freedom ', Hartmann affirms (NW 97). By thus treating freedom as a problem of the ' order of ranks ' he succeeds in establishing another balance. His solution is offered as a via media between determinism and indeterminism (ARW 557-559). Once more a decision seems to be circumvented, neutrality saved. But is it really ? The freedom permitted by Hartmann's laws of categorial stratification throws little or no light on that freedom of choice of which we have an immediate experience and which is involved in all terms descriptive of human actions. Only a certain type of actions, those by which we assert our freedom from instinctive urges, provides fitting illustrations. Hart- mann's concept of freedom is a merely negative one. It is 'freedom from . . ., not ' freedom for ... .'. Analogously to the strata of Being, we might expect to find a supreme sphere, a realm of freedom, dominated by categories of the highest order and forming the pinnacle of the ontological pyramid. But this expectation is disappointed. Scaling the grades of Hartmann's structure of Being to the top, we do not finally arrive at a supreme fulfilment, life eternal, the freedom not to sin-far from it. We arrive at a void, and this void, Hartmann tells us, cannot be filled. According to his own avowal he does not show that freedom exists. He proves only its negative possibility: there is nothing in the structure of Being which prevents freedom from being. And he also shows that it is morally required. Human insight, according to Hartmann's appraisal, does not take us any further (E 799). Freedom, for him, is a problematic possibility rather than a reality. With this negative idea of freedom in mind we are in a better position to understand the thesis of the 'weakness of the spirit' as a metaphysical principle. The strength of the categories, Hartmann holds, is inversely related to their height: the higher, the weaker; the lower, the stronger (ARW 528-529, NW 74). Near the top we find wealth of structural forms</page><page sequence="21">NICOLAI HARTMANN S ONTOLOGY 309 and superior differentiation, near the bottom, strength. How in these circumstances a world could arise seems a riddle. Hartmann does not undertake to suggest a solution, and we may wonder what precisely he means by strength. Hartmann mentions three marks of strength: (a) being fundamental (in the sense of an existential conditio sine qua non), (b) existential independence. (c) determinative power (ARW 529). We need not enlarge on (a) and (b). These are marks admittedly characterising the lower stratum in relation to the higher one. But they do not constitute ' strength'. The stone is indispensable to the builder and it is independent of him, but we do not therefore call it ' stronger '. There remains (c), ' deter- minative power', as the one real criterion of strength. Which of the two has greater 'determinative power' (Bestimmungskraft) relative to the building: the builder or the stone ? 'The builder', Aristotle answers, ' and this is why the builder is the stronger of the two '. 'The stone', Hartmann answers, 'because the builder is unable to change the nature of the stone'. Hartmann's answer may seem unreasonable and in fact it is at variance with his own hierarchical scheme-that piece of metaphysical inheritance which he has appropriated. But the answer is in harmony with the deeper trend in his thought. In the last analysis he must reject the likeness of the builder and his material as not fitting the case. The building has a purpose, it is a meaningful whole, constructed in accordance with a rational plan. All this is not true of reality as Hartmann sees it. This is why he casts his vote with Aristotle's opponents-with the opponents of the metaphysical tradition-by ascribing the greater strength to what is lower in ontological rank. The principle of strength, illogical though it is, reveals a trait of Hartmann's Weltanschauung. In support of his view he recalls facts which are as familiar to everyone as their interpretation is doubtful : the smallness of man as compared to his mundane environment, the brevity of his history, the frailty of his body, the precariousness of his life (ARW 524-525). The idea of a spiritual God is clearly inadmissible for Hartmann. But his point of view involves a tacit denial of even graver import. There is one hall-mark of divinity acknowledged by all religious creeds, from primitive tribal forms of worship to the great spiritual religions, and recognised by Hartmann himself (PGS 244) : divinity is power. Hartmann's philosophy, through its principle of strength, excludes religion. The only view of religion with which it might be reconciled would be a modernised Epicurean con- cept : the idea of a non-interfering God living in I do not know what inter- stices of Being, perfect and inefficacious. VI PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE In Plato's cosmology, and similarly in that of Aristotle, one particular feature of the macrocosm, the inclination of the ecliptic in relation to the equatorial circle, is given a singular importance. The reason is obvious. This feature is responsible for the alternations of the seasons and, therewith,</page><page sequence="22">310 HELMUT KUHN for the possibility of life on earth. At the same time, Plato views this devia- tion from the rotational symmetry of the heavens as a cosmic counterpart to the duality of ontological principles. The equatorial circle describes the motion of the Same, the ecliptic that of the Different. In this manner the cosmological approach, guided by a concrete vision of the world in its physical aspect, combines with an ontological approach, operating within a totally different frame of reference. This combination is fraught with difficulties. It seems speculative in the derogative sense of the term, and Plato, well aware of its vulnerability, offered his philosophy of nature under the form of a myth, as a 'likely account '. It is noteworthy that modern attempts at a philosophy of nature belong under one of two types of theory, according to whether the first approach or the second one is favoured. Scientists writing for philosophically interested readers generally prefer the cosmo- logical approach. Sir Arthur Eddington, Sir James Jeans, Louis de Broglie, C. A. von Weizsicker may serve as examples. Nicolai Hartmann, on the other hand, with the majority of professional philosophers, uses an abstract scheme of reference. Although he happens to be an amateur astronomer, the vision of our solar system forming a relatively small part of a galaxy among galaxies does not loom large in his disquisitions on nature. He some- times calls the stratified reality 'world ', but this is a misleading term. Actually the hierarchical scheme built up by him might be described as an ontological table rather than as a conceptual portrait of the world. The philosophy of nature is for him a study of the special categories determining the two bottom layers of quadruple reality, inanimate matter and organic life. Hartmann's Philosophie der Natur, of all the works of this apostate from neo-Kantianism, is the most Kantian one. Down to the table of contents it reflects the structure of the Critique of Pure Reason. It begins with an analysis of space and time styled 'dimensional categories', the counterpart to Kant's 'transcendental aesthetics '. Part two, entitled ' Cosmological Categories', roughly corresponds to Kant's 'transcendental analytics'. The main theme here as well as there is the principle of causality. Finally, part three, on ' Organological Categories ', though not an exact parallel to ' trans- cendental dialectic', is analogous to that portion of the Critique in so far as it deals with a trans-physical idea-the one to which the second part of Kant's Critique of Judgement is devoted. This parallelism is more than a superficial similarity. Both in spirit and letter the treatment of space and time shows the dominant influence of the first Critique. For Hartmann, just as for Kant, space and time are 'conditions' rendering possible the existence of things spatial and temporal. Kant calls space and time 'forms of intuition ' (Formen der Anschauung), not meaning to say that we intuit space and time but rather that they furnish the a priori determinants under- lying our 'intuitions ', i.e. our (inner and outer) perceptions. Hartmann adopts this terminology. Speaking of Anschauungsraum he means space qua conditions rendering possible the perception of spatial objects, and the same holds of Anschauungszeit.</page><page sequence="23">NTCOLAI HARTMANN S ONTOLOGY 311 This conformity does not, of course, involve the acceptance of Kant's transcendental point of view. Faithful to the principles of his ontology, Hartmann considers space and time primarily categories of reality. As such they are not, strictly speaking, to be reckoned among the 'special categories' of 'nature', i.e. the two bottom strata of reality. Similar therein to the 'fundamental categories', they extend through several layers. Space, Hartmann holds, 'breaks off' at the level of psychical life, whereas time is ubiquitous. Not even spiritual life is exempt from temporal- ity. As we fit the 'dimensional categories' into the context of the hier- archical order of reality, the' law of modification ' (cf. p. 307 above) is brought to bear upon them. Space, or more precisely spatiality, is one and the same. But its structure varies with the ontological level. The spatiality of the molecule differs from that of the organism. And the same remark applies to temporality. This principle enables Hartmann to shed the physi- calism which mars Kant's transcendental aesthetics, though the emancipation is far from complete. This part of Hartmann's work disappoints by not fully exploiting the possibilities of his own theory. It is a well-known fact-and one of great philosophical significance-that, if I have an idea, this happens not only at a certain time but also somewhere, say, in my study. Hartmann, whose honesty as a thinker never fails him, takes cognisance of facts of this type, but he is at a loss to make sense of them. His formulae of a 'mediated spatiality' and a 'spatiality of the non-spatial' (PN 112- 113) only betray his perplexity. 'The cognitive relationship is not ontologically basic. It does not cleave Being into the world of the subject and that of the object' (ARW 172). This may be fundamentally true. Cartesian philosophy with its dualist point of departure seems in fact to manoeuvre philosophy into an impasse. In addition, the truth at which Hartmann aims has its well-defined place in traditional metaphysics. But it can be safely maintained only by virtue of a metaphysical conception of reason which Hartmann lacks (cf. p. 299 above). So he exaggerates the truth into a falsehood. The problem of subjectivity-of the Fiirsich, in Hegelian parlance-, suppressed rather than resolved by its reduction to a problem of hierarchical order, returns with a vengeance. In the theory of space and time it forces upon the analyst an awkward duplication. He must distinguish between Realzeit and Anschauungs- zeit (PN 55-61), and make a like distinction in regard to space. This is the same duplication which, Hartmann asserts, categories generally suffer at the level of consciousness. Through that peculiar reality, mind, a bi- furcation arises : categories of knowledge get separated from, and related to, categories of reality. This universal duplication in its turn is 'onto- logically nothing but a special case of categorial recurrence' (PN 58, cf. p. 305 above). Consciousness is 'nothing but ' an instance of the stratified order of reality-with this extraordinary statement Cartesianism is over- looked rather than overcome. The Ansich of negatively defined Being absorbs the Fiirsich, destroying that balance which, as Hartmann well knows, is fundamental to metaphysical truth.</page><page sequence="24">312 HELMUT KUHN The emphasis, in the analysis of' dimensional categories ', is on Realraum and Realzeit, and within this limited area physical space and physical time take precedence. However, the hegemony exercised by physics is less tyrannical than in Kant, and this widening of the horizon is due not only to the multiformity of reality as viewed by Hartmann but also to the attitude he takes toward contemporary physics. He does not ascribe to it that metaphysical finality with which the Newtonian physics of his time was endowed by Kant. Physics, looked at as a method, is a metrical or mathe- matical science. But the structure of real processes is not to be exhausted by quantitative terms. So mathematical physics deals with reality qua measurable, not with reality as such (PN 24). Basing himself on this prin- ciple, Hartmann maintains an attitude of critical aloofness towards the theory of relativity. He does not arrogate to himself the right of pronouncing on the recondite problems at issue in theoretical physics. But he points out the logical difficulties involved in the idea of the relativity of space-time combined with the thesis of the velocity of light as an absolutum (PN 245- 247), and he thus arrives at the following verdict: in as much as the theory of relativity bears upon mathematical relationships of measurement in space and time, it is correct. If the categorial conclusions drawn from it concerning space and time are taken literally, it is wrong. Its mistake consists in not heeding the boundary separating these two interpretations (PN 249). In Part two of his Philosophy of Nature Hartmann establishes a set of categories rather different from the one in Kant's transcendental analytics (PN 252); but, as in this section of the Critique, attention is focused on one particular category, causality. Causality, according to Hartmann, is the 'linear determinative form of the real process (eine lineare Determinations- form im Realprozess) owing to which the temporally later [event] is deter- mined by the earlier [event] ', a determination which first introduces orderly sequence into the temporal flux (PN 319). How closely this definition follows the model set by Kant need hardly be pointed out. Everything said in connection with the analysis of space and time applies mutatis mutandis to the treatment of causality. Here too the resulting theory is characterized by a refined and mitigated physicalism. Likewise the attitude taken in regard to the problems of quantum physics and the indeterminacy principle corresponds to his treatment of the theory of relativity in Part one. Causal- ity, he holds, determines the real process throughout. Our inability, in the realm of microphysics, to define the causal nexus by laws and to make exact predictions leaves intact the principle of causality as such. ' The substitution of statistical laws for the laws of classical physics only transfers the real laws of nature into a greater depth, the hidden " interior of nature ". There they are no longer accessible to the methods of direct experience through observation and experiment' (PN 409). Hence the illusion arises as though the laws of nature themselves were obliterated-an unwarranted inference exploited by a 'rash relativism ' (ibid.). The analysis of organic nature, filling Part three of Hartmann's treatise,</page><page sequence="25">NICOLAI HARTMANN S ONTOLOGY 313 maintains a balance between physicalism and vitalism. A limited value is conceded to teleological interpretation, though the ideas of end or purpose (Zweck) appear ultimately incapable of doing justice to biological facts. However, no other concept is suggested in their place. 'Our intellect does not command decisive categories of the organic ', he concludes. This realm, intermediate as it is between physical reality and psychic life, is 'relatively inaccessible ' (PN 30). Finally a genetic approach to the otherwise unassail- able problem is sought through the theory of evolution. Hartmann tries to achieve a reconciliation of the Darwinian principle of selection and the tele- ological principle. 'The higher formal and functional type is the more pur- poseful one in the rivalry of the struggle for existence ', he asserts (PN 652). This thesis, plausible enough by itself, seems to contradict the principle according to which strength decreases with categorial height. VII PHILOSOPHY OF MIND Hartmann's chief books on ontology (GO, MW, ARW) are conceived as a sequence, with the Philosophy of Nature adding a fourth part to the magnum opus. But it is the concluding part only in a biographical sense. Further volumes, which Hartmann did not live to write, would have to develop the 'special doctrine of the categories' for the two upper stages of the ontological ascent, psychical life and spiritual life. This lacuna is to some extent filled by two books published during the long interval between the programmatic Metaphysics of Knowledge (1921) and appearance of the three volumes on ontology in 19348. The first of these two works, his Ethics, is the best-known and most influential of Hartmann's publications and the only one of which an English translation has appeared. In the Preface to the Ethics Hartmann acknowledges his indebtedness to Aristotle, Kant, Nietzsche, and Scheler. Of these four, Aristotle is of least significance to the author. He provides him with materials rather than with principles. By rejecting the concept of a summum bonum Hartmann places himself outside the Platonic-Aristotelian tradition. He likewise emancipates himself from the Christian tradition in ethics-hence the significance attributed to Nietzsche, the man who said 'God is dead', and who proclaimed the need for a fresh vision of values. The real axis, however, around which Hartmann's ethical thought turns, is marked by the names of Kant and Scheler. In Hartmann's appraisal, Kant secured once and for all the a priori basis of moral life. He accepts the Kantain criticism of eudaemonism without ever seriously asking whether the critic fully under- stood the idea of eVSa Ltovia or beatitude which he attacked. While thus basing himself on Kant, he yet conceives his ethics as a countermove to Kantian ethics. This anti-Kantian opposition was started by Max Scheler in his book Der Formalismus in der Ethik und die materiale Wertethik. Neuer 8A work on aesthetics which was ready for publication when Hartmann died may still appear,</page><page sequence="26">314 HELMUT KUHN Versuch der Grundlegung eines ethischen Personalismus (Halle a.d. S., 1913- 1916, 3rd ed. 1927). Scheler accused Kant's ' formalism ' of being responsible for the atrophy suffered by ethical thought in Germany and he undertook to supplant formal ethics by a material ethics based on the intuition of values as ideal entities. This is exactly what Hartmann tries to achieve again. In some respects Scheler's rambling and ill-constructed treatise compares unfavourably with Hartmann's ponderous but clean structure. However, the constructive ideas of Hartmann's ethics are all anticipated by Scheler. Even the ethos of Hartmann's work echoes the triumphant note struck by his forerunner. Hartmann, generally dry and sober, grows enthusiastic over the act of liberation which he performs. 'The tragedy of man ', he writes, 'is that of a starving person, seated at a table laden with food, but failing to stretch out his hand because he does not see what is before him' (E 11). Hartmann sets himself the task of opening the starving man's eyes. By unfolding for his vision the domain of values, comparable in profusion and majesty to the star-spangled sky, the phil- osopher desires to awaken the ' demiurge ' in man to his gigantic duty of self-creation (E 5). Thus the Nietzschean pathos of ecstatic humanism combines with Scheler's phenomenological aspiration towards the disclosure of fresh horizons. And the two interlocking motifs are counterbalanced by an insistence on the moral a priori derived from Kant but divorced from the Kantian idea of form. Two elements considered mutually exclusive by Kant, ' a priori ' and 'material' are to be fused in the new 'material' ethics (E 109). Values, according to Hartmann, are ideal entities. As such they form a special class within ideal Being which in turn is distinguished from reality as another independent though secondary type of Being in general (cf. p. 302 above). These ideal entities are interrelated so as to form a whole realm of structures. Participating in the universal character of Being they are what they are per se, in complete independence of their being discovered, respected, conformed to, or ignored. They are not to be confused with 'goods', i.e. with objects in which they become embodied. Their being consists in their being valid, i.e. in the peculiar demand they make upon man once they are known by him. Values are intuited. This intuition of values (Wertschau) is not a specifically cognitive act. It involves the emotion- al life of man and can also be described as a ' sentiment of values ' (Wert- gefiihl), the immediacy of grasp being the characteristic trait of the act. The organ of awareness of the ' firmament of values ' (E 544) is the ' heart ', in Pascal's sense of this term, rather than the intellect. Intuiting a value is not tantamount to acting in accordance with it. But it is inchoate action just as, conversely, action is vision grown active. We read : 'The whole responsibility for the legitimacy and objectivity of the standard of valuation rests upon the a priori intuition proper, that is, in the last analysis, on the sentiment of values' (E 127). This seems like throwing the door wide open to whim and fancy. At various times various people feel all kinds of things. And what is the use of ethics, we may ask,</page><page sequence="27">NICOLAI HARTMANN'S ONTOLOGY 315 if, instead of guiding our judgements, it refers us to our own feeling as the sole arbiter ? Hartmann's reply is twofold. Values, grasped by intuition are a priori, he affirms. The intuition or feeling by means of which we apprehend values is not derived from other data. No genetic analysis can explain it. It discloses to us qualities in no way anticipated in experiences of a different type. To these negative marks of the a priori a positive one is added. The values are, in the Kantian sense, the ' condition of the possibility ' of man's moral life. 'It is not the person that constitutes values but conversely values constitute the person. The autonomy of the person, for instance, presupposes values' (E 134). Likewise, values are the 'condition of the possibility' of a conscience (E 136). Furthermore, values make an un- conditional demand upon the one who perceives them. The 'thou shalt ' does not supervene as a command issuing from the authority of a human or superhuman person. It is of the essence of values to be authoritative. To be precise, not all values carry the absolute demand. The realm of values stretches beyond the sphere of ethics. 'The higher values, moral in the narrower sense, are exclusively values of persons and acts' (Person- und Aktwerte, E 142), and they alone are characterised by the absoluteness of their claim. These arguments, as Hartmann well knows, do not touch the real diffi- culty. The values perceived by me may well be a priori in relation to my personal life, and demand my absolute subjection to them. But what guarantees their being 'objective ' in the sense of 'valid at every time for every one' ? What criterion do I have for testing my intuitions and pro- tecting myself against moral error ? My personal life may be warped. Then its premises will be equally faulty, and knowing them as the a priori of my actions will be of no avail to me. It may even cause me to stiffen in my wickedness. Hartmann is hard put to it to ward off arguments like these which bring home to him the danger of moral subjectivism. He may point out that ' every authentic value judgement is accompanied by the conviction that every other person must judge likewise and have the same sentiments of value ' (E 155). But what legitimates this conviction which, as everyone knows, frequently deceives us ? Hartmann may remind us of values such as honesty, and faithfulness which are necessarily reciprocal and thereby transsubjective; or again he may show that the a priori character of moral values extends beyond the individual life to the life of communities. All this, however, does not truly solve our problem. For communities may be in conflict with each other, not only in point of fact but also in point of value judgement. So the real answer to the problem of moral subjectivism or relativism must lie elsewhere. Hartmann seeks this answer precisely where Scheler hoped to find it. Values are thought of as forming a realm of ideal entities, interrelated with each other and differentiated by their relative height. There is a hierarchical order of strata or tiers of values paralleling the stratification of reality and dominated by corresponding laws. This order is independent of times and</page><page sequence="28">316 HELMUT KUHN customs, deeds and misdeeds, of human insight and the vagaries of changing opinion. To obtain a total vision of this realm is beyond us. But careful phenomenological analysis may both catch glimpses of the whole and illum- inate parts of it. Evolution or historical variations are not excluded but rather explained by this absolute order. Human vision, comparable to a search-light, moves across the dark vault of the unknown 'firmament of values' (Sternhimmel von Werten, E 544), picking out a small court of light. What seems a succession of divergent or conflicting moralities is actually the shift of the field of awareness in relation to the immovable order. The illuminated spot which our personal gifts and our historical situation select for us we generally mistake for the entire firmament of values. From this narrow- mindedness the idea of the objective order of values promises to free us. A grandiose idea, worthy of Max Scheler's genius. But is it amenable to development into a veritable doctrine ? Neither Scheler's nor Hartmann's treatment of the subject sets this sceptical query at rest. Scheler tries to support his idea by setting up five criteria of the relative height of values: durability, capability for being shared, fundamentality, depth of satisfaction, relatedness to the higher faculties. By means of these criteria, Hartmann thinks, we can set the moral values above the values of vitality. But they are too coarse to reveal the finer stratification within the moral sphere (E 284). This may be so. But Hartmann's own attempt at discovering a hierarchy of moral values is equally unsuccessful. 'The result is but slight ', he concedes (E 546). This failure is aggravated by the admitted importance of the problem. Values generally present themselves under the form of an alternative, one value competing with another. 'What shall we do ? ' is the basic question to which, Hartmann assures us, ethics must provide an answer (E 2). Every moral decision raises the question of the hierarchy of values, and every decision is an answer to it. Put to the test of this crucial question, the grand idea of a timeless order of values proves worthless. The theorist abandons us to our feelings. The sentiment of value, we are told, involves a sentiment of preference and thus discovers something about the order of values along with the particular value. The superior rank of a value, though discerned by an act of preference, does not, as Hartmann, following Scheler, emphasizes, consist in its being preferred. The acts of preference belong in the medium of historical relativity and changing moralities, whereas the order which defines the rank of values is unchanging (E 285). One may be in doubt as to whether the timeless order of values as pro- claimed by Scheler and Hartmann actually exists. But there is little doubt that on their own showing it must be unknowable. Hartmann's very reserved suggestions as to its structure, together with his analysis of values and virtues throughout, do not give us the impression that a vast dome, over- arching our poor time-bound structures, reveals itself, be it only by glimpses and intimations. On the contrary, a very limited moral vision is dogmatically asserted. On page 546 of the Ethics, for example, the following scale of values is sketched: neighbourly love above justice, Fernstenliebe above</page><page sequence="29">NICOLAI HARTMANN S ONTOLOGY 317 neighbourly love, personal love above Fernstenliebe. Fernstenliebe, Hart- mann's favorite virtue, a neo-logistic pun, invented by Nietzsche, on the word Ndchstenliebe, means an aspiration toward a future perfection of human nature. We divine something like a sentimentalized version of Nietzschean morality, so ephemeral that even now, only a quarter of a century after the first publication of the Ethics, it impresses the reader as the relic of a by-gone era. Hartmann does not share Nietzsche's anti-Christian animosity. He acknowledges the superiority of the Christian morality of love over the pagan morality of justice. But his acquaintance with Christianity, its actual teaching and the treasures of moral insight enshrined in Christian literature, is slight indeed. His ontology, with its denial of transcendence and divinity, blinds him to the one great reality dominating the moral thought of Western civilization. 'The individual', he writes in explaining Christian ethics, 'has not to care for his neighbour's salvation but in the first place only for his own . . . This is the point where the Christian must necessarily be both an egoist and a eudaemonist because of the otherworldliness of his religious metaphysics' (E 84-85). Has Hartmann ever heard of the great debate about 'pure love' ? Has he ever come in contact with an authentically Christian ethics? The richest source of moral instruction does not flow for him. The individual as a moral agent must be put in touch with an order transcending him. This is the problem of Hartmann's ethics as of every ethics. But in spite of a prodigious effort Hartmann's attempt at a solution fails. The intuitionist doctrine of values does not furnish the desired clue. The artificial separation of values from reality, an implication of Hartmann's negative concept of Being, proves fatal. No ingenuity can make these ideal entities strike root in the alien soil of reality. So the individual, unable to reach up to the height where values sparkle, relapses into the unenlightened subjectivity of his own feelings. But in systematic thought-and Hart- mann, after all, is a systematic thinker par excellence-every defect requires to be counterbalanced by a corresponding excess. The individual, left home- less, as it were, in ethics, must be given a habitat elsewhere. Unhappily free in his relation to intuited values, he will submit to some other power with an abandon detrimental to his freedom. Historical life is that other habitat or power to which man is handed over by Hartmann, and a fresh approach is taken in Das Problem des geistigen Seins. As the title suggests, this work is chiefly devoted to a study of the topmost rank of four-divided reality, the life of the 'spirit'. Under the influence of Hegel, 'spirit' (Geist) is viewed chiefly as embodied in the 'objective spirit' in history. The products of the human mind, forms of communal life, religions, sciences, philosophies, arts, mechanical inventions, in short, all the works of so-called culture, form a moving pattern. This pattern follows its own laws in relative independence of the psychical life of the individuals involved. The formative power, animating this total process, is called Geist-a dangerous word because it insinuates Hegelian metaphysics with its characteristic deification of history.</page><page sequence="30">318 HELMUT KUHN Hartmann is not blind to this danger. He blames Hegel for his prejudice in favour of the Gemeingeist (PGS 338) and strives hard to maintain the autonomy of the individual. In fact, the whole first part of his tripartite work on Geistiges Sein (PGS) deals with the human person (Der personale Geist, 45-174). But in his subsequent analysis he, or rather his idea of individuality, is overwhelmed by the spirit of Hegelianism. Since the individual has no moral lodestar to direct him (the heaven of values is too remote) he inadvertently finds himself bowing to the authority of the Zeit- geist. 'The factor which, in the long run, always prevails is the actually effective tendency of the living Gemeingeist', he writes (PGS 279), and the ' Realpolitiker in the grand style ' is for him the one who divines the 'wave of the future' (PGS 333). Reading these sentences we are filled with un- easiness. We remember the Platonic notion of the true statesman, the navi- gator who knows the goal of the journey, and we are not convinced that the goal always lies where the wind of Zeitgeist blows. For Hartmann, the great leader is the one who keeps close to reality in its growth towards the future. But this is a truth only for the looker-on, not for living and acting man, ignorant as he is of the future and in need of non-temporal standards. The theory of the 'objective spirit', in Hartmann and in the Hegelian tradition generally, lays itself open to the charge of' metaphysical opportun- ism'. This kind of opportunism, unlike the attitude generally denoted by this word, is by no means contemptible. It can be, and in most cases is, a high-minded view. It consists in replacing the question, 'what is good ? ' with the question, 'what is timely ? ' Time is the unavowed Absolute, and the historical Katpos its manifestation. Apart from their explicit mutual relations there is a hidden correspondence of a subtler kind between Hart- mann's ontology and his Hegelian theory of 'objektiver Geist'. Being, negatively defined and therefore 'empty', awaits a 'filling ', and this is added to it by a recourse to time deified under the name of Zeitgeist. Being is meaningless. Man, a free creator, is called upon to give it meaning by action in history. For the form of the accomplishment of meaning (Sinner- fiillung) which befits man must be 'once again a new and a different one '9 -a pathetic requirement. The profundity of the problem stirred up rather than posed by his philosophy is not fathomed by Hartmann. With the single-mindedness of a passionate builder he is pre-occupied with erecting a pyramid of Being that rests on nothing except the heroic will to defeat Nothingness. Like many a great thinker he teaches a lesson not included in his doctrine. Trying to achieve the impossible, he constructs a theory of Being without faith in Being.
