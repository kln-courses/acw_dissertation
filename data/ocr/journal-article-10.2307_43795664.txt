<plain_text><page sequence="1">Thomas A. Nelson The Disney Look, another of those uppercase shibboleths which critics love and artists loathe, did not come into full being like one of those deities wrought out of Zeus's skull. It developed gradually over several decades, influenced to a great extent by a creative impulse for experimentation and exploration.1 What emerges in the animation features of the 1950's is a style, perhaps even an attitude, which one associates with a Disney Look. That look has been harshly characterized as reflective of a Disney Version of experience, a Disney Imperative relentlessly seeking to convert fantasy into artificial forms of reality.2 Richard Schickel, in his desire to penetrate the promotional hucksterism of the Disney mythmakers, sees that version as one traditional to Mid-America, success-oriented to an exaggerated degree, mawkishly sentimental to the point of reductionism. From this vantage point, the apotheosis of the Disney Look in the 1960's represents both an acquiescence to audience expectation and a falsification of past and present reality through an assembly-line uniformity in content and style. For Schickel, and a growing multitude who share his perspective, Disney never grows up and, in effect, expresses and influences the formation of a juvenile American mass consciousness. My intention is not merely to praise or to damn, nor to create out of the Disney success a springboard for socio-psychological speculations. Schickel has accomplished that, and while he has not done it definitively, he has done it intelligently. It may be too convenient to make of Disney's films and biography an emblematic microcosm for either the good or the bad in American popular culture. It represents something of a critical fait accompli to discuss Disney's primary creative endeavor- the making of elaborate animations- as occupying in importance as significant a place in the formation of our cultural character as the concept of Manifest Destiny and the invention of that Adamsian dread, the dynamo. Disney, the man and the artist, in non-monolithic ways reflects such historical givens, but hardly can he be given credit or damned for their many achievements or misfirings. Indeed, my ambitions in this essay are more modest- I only hope to describe, to analyze, to speculate about, and to chart the shifts and developments which occur in the relationship between the depiction of the dark forces and an evolving Disney Look in representative animated features from Snow White (1938) to Robin Hood (1973). 94</page><page sequence="2">Darkness in Disney/ 9b Considering the background provided by categories of understanding such as the Disney Version and the Disney Imperative, it would follow that a defi- nition of the dark elements in these features should be self-evident. That is, as with the steady emergence of a Disney animation naturalism and a consistent treatment of a variety of sources- fairy tales, Mickey cartoons, live-action renditions of quasi-historical children's classics, the television World of Disney with its melange of stolid, optimistic Americana- the dark forces take on a corresponding look and feel as we move into the 1970's. We will discover that in those years the outlines of darkness in Disney assume an increasingly less inchoate and more rounded look. Such a development does not move in a straight line nor does it necessarily result in a style lacking artistic value. That, however, the animated product after 1950 begins to assume a recognizable look cannot be denied. Disney's first animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, provided an opportunity for both economic and artistic expansion. If, as Christopher Finch believes, Disney sought a structure "that would give him a chance to evolve more complex plot ideas and greater naturalism,"3 the choice of the fairy tale in general and the Snow White story in particular produces immediate reactions from anyone interested in the Disney treatment of dark characters and dark forces. Fairy tales have been characterized in several ways, as everything from light entertainment to archetypal touchstones, but one factor common to them all involves their division of the world's moral ambiguities into tidy dialectical halves. While the positive agents within the fairy tale strive for transcendence, for a point of ultimate union and enlightenment, the dark forces create a hellish counter-motion, one driving downward into darkness and pandemonium. The goal of the first symbolizes wish-fulfillment, a paradisiac freedom from both psychic and natural obstacles, while the latter glories in the creation of an alternative world of bondage and subjugation. In addition, most fairy tales dwell on what Joseph Campbell calls the "monstrous, irrational and unnatural," and a primitive symbolism which reveals a human proclivity for ordering life's mysteries into repetitive and imaginative fictional categories. Such character and symbol patterns function within an overall structure which remains constant, while allowing for expansions and inventive alterations of particulars without losing a universal human applicability.4 The Wicked Queen in Disney's Snow White not only represents one such amplification, but one of his most terrifying embodiments of a fairy-tale evil; early outline notes of the film, for instance, characterize her as a "mix- ture of Lady Macbeth and the Big Bad Wolf,"5 indicating an intention to darken her character beyond the suggestions found in Grimm. In that version, for example, the Wicked Queen never transforms herself through black magic into a witchlike old crone, but instead disguises herself on three dif- ferent occasions as an old pedlar selling fancy lace stays, an old woman dispensing attractive combs, and a farmer's wife selling apples. The only witchcraft she practices involves the creation of poisonous snares (comb and apple) for the innocent, consumer-minded Snow White. Disney, in con- trast, attaches greater supernatural authority to his Wicked Queen and there- by suggests her association with a darkness within both nature and human nature. Her metamorphosis into the witch stands as one of Disney's most inventive renderings of evil and indirectly alludes to the horrors spawned</page><page sequence="3">967 Darkness in Disney in the Karloffian film laboratories of the 1930's. Another dark element greatly embellished from the source can be found in Snow White's nightmare retreat into the dark forest. Even though that journey ends happily with her discovery that the shadowy specters of the forest were merely psychic tre- mors, nevertheless Disney chooses to interiorize darkness and to pass on the unsettling notion that evil resides as much within as it does without. What we and Snow White perceive, of course, is the forest's benevolence, but not without a cognizance that appearances, even in a world of cuddly animals and comically loving dwarfs, cannot always be trusted. Such a mes- sage resides in the original tale's portrayal of evil. The Wicked Queen's ob- sessive narcissism and desire to cannibalize Snow White's greater beauty and goodness find later parallels in Snow White's urge to beautify herself with the silken lace stays and poisonous comb given her by the disguised Queen. Disney, in contrast, paints Snow White as lacking even the slightest frailty, and therefore concentrates on a single temptation (the apple) and eliminates any touch of moral vagary in her character. As a result, the insipid sweetness of Disney's Snow White demands that the darkness of the Wicked Queen be intensified and enlarged. If the Wicked Queen embodies an ominous, even gothic, darkness existing in the nature of things, the forest which provides Snow White with refuge represents a Disney vision of a goodness and beneficence residing in nature. Surely it is no accident that those creatures who first frighten Snow White in her nightmare flight through the woods are the very ones who eventually rush to her rescue and assist in the destruction of the Wicked Queen. Amidst thunder and lightning, they pursue her to the rocky cliff where we witness an aroused nature destroying the darkness within itself. In the original story, no such thing happens- there, the brothers Grimm imitate their name as the Queen's death results from an avenging goodness forcibly placing on her feet, with tongs no less, a pair of red-hot dancing slippers. Another important aspect of the Disney treatment of the dark element in Snow White finds expression through the film's animation style. Frequently, this film has been cited as an early indication of Disney's commitment to a full animated naturalism and, in the overall portrayal of Snow White, the forest life, and Prince Charming that style has met with considerable objec- tion. Yet, the scenes involving the Wicked Queen, especially those of her transformation, her trip to the dwarf's cottage, and her death, are animated in an inventively expressionistic manner. The realism of Snow White's world, of course, has come to be associated with the familiar Disney Look, while the dramatic expressionism so strikingly employed not only in Snow White , but soon after in Pinocchio (1940) and Fantasia (1940), will all but dis- appear from later features. An interesting aesthetic equation retrospectively emerges from such a development: (1) that Disney, at the time of Snow White , employed realistic animation to enhance an idealization of goodness and the bounties of nature, while he found an expressionism in style appro- priate to the treatment of a fairy-tale darkness; and, (2) that idealized world, in later years, comes to be identified by the audience as a Disney "reality," while the more disturbing expressionism used for those episodes portraying darkness and evil represents an "unreality," nothing more than stylized aberrations.6 Such animated blendings, however, complement the dialectical conflicts common to fairy tales like Snow White and lend a visual richness</page><page sequence="4">Darkness in Disney /97 to the film. Unfortunately, these conflicting styles may have represented to Disney more than appropriate artistic choices, but a personal preference. In later films, he will not permit the dark forces to occupy the kind of dramatic and stylistic autonomy found in Snow White , Pinocchio , and Fan- tasia ; indeed, the Disney Look, with the greater realism afforded by the multiplane camera, will dictate a steady devaluation and reduction of dra- matic and visual stature in the treatment of darkness. Such a development had not been effected by the time of Pinocchio ( 1 940). In fact, in adapting this children's classic by Collodi, Disney found a fairy-tale depiction of a dramatic opposition between good and evil, although in this case the major villain assumes complete human form in the figure of Stromboli. Christopher Finch believes Stromboli to be Disney's greatest villain, one "sub- ject to eruptions of sheer evil" and suggestive of a "force in nature."7 What Finch describes in Disney's Stromboli is a completely unsentimental and exaggerated approach to evil. In such pure form, as with the motiveless ma- lignity of Shakespeare's lago, evil takes on an allegorical character and, in Pinocchio, Stromboli's urge to subjugate, whip, cage, and tyrannize stands in opposition to the sentimentalized Gepetto. Both symbolize fathers and cre- ators, one fostering life and growth, the other a dehumanizing control. Only the benevolent presence of the Blue Fairy saves the story and the film from a severely dark course. The sinister villainy of Stromboli finds relief through the more caricatured treatment of the street thugs in the film- namely, Honest John the fox, Gideon the cat, and Lampwick, a pool-hall juvenile delinquent. Honest John and Gideon take on the outline of a familiar comic team, one playing the dunce to the other's cunning malice, while Lampwick's character resembles the kind of attractive loutishness popularized by the Dead End Kids. Even Monstro the Whale does not prove to be as terrifying as Stromboli and his whip, although those scenes inside the giant whale are some of the finest moments in Disney. The anxiety generated by Monstro's menacing enormity is greatly relieved by his Bunyanesque sneezes. All these episodes with villains and forces of danger bring welcome adventure and visual excitement to the film, while, for the younger audience, providing a lull from the film's many terrors. Perhaps the darkest element in Pinocchio emerges from its controlling idea: that the marionette's dream of becoming a boy, and his subsequent journey toward that goal, are threatened by a world of horrors and nightmares which would deny him his boyhood. Stromboli, for instance, treats Pinocchio not as a boy, but as a thing belonging on the end of a string or in a woodpile. Epi- sodes showing horrifying metamorphoses abound in the film. Pinocchio's nose grows to grotesque proportions as he lies to the Blue Fairy, surely a re- flection of a very real and dreaded childhood trauma resulting from the diffi- cult process of conforming to adult rules of behavior. The entire film, in fact, subjects the audience to a host of related fears and anxieties- of a child's fear of losing love, of being treated as a thing, a puppet, one capable of being dis- mantled and thrown away, of being transformed into something mechanical or bestial. This frightening parade peaks in the nightmare atmosphere of Pleasure Island, where Pinocchio and Lampwick realize not humanization and freedom, but bestiality and bondage. Lampwick's gradual transformation into asininity and the scene of the cart carrying off the donkey-boys are part of a truly impressive dark sequence.</page><page sequence="5">98/Darkness in Disney What distinguishes Pinocchio from other Disney features is a carefully wrought animation which fluctuates between the poles of realism and styliza- tion, and a complex rendering of its subject matter. This film, I think, draws forth deeper audience responses than earlier or later Disney features. The alle- gorical quality of Pinocchio's quest, the uncompromising depiction of Stromboli and the perils of Pleasure Island, the realism of Monstro, one Disney animal not cast in the cuddly mode, and the severity of the film's moral posi- tion (one which asserts that if a boy does not go to school and obey responsi- ble adults, he will emerge as something less than human) strike with a force uncommon to a Disney film. Ways, of course, are found to soften the impact of these dark shadings: Jimmy Cricket, the cheerful companion and conscience to Pinocchio; Figaro, the cat, a carry over from earlier Disney cartoons; the sentimental Gepetto; and the omnipresent Blue Fairy assure us that we will come out of the nightmare and witness the joyous resurrection and transfor- mation of Pinocchio into official boyhood. The Disney sparkle may win out on the screen, but long after the film's conclusion we continue to recall images of darkness. Bambi (1942) represents a considerable departure from the style and con- tent of Pinocchio .8 Felix Salten's famous story, one which harshly and forth- rightly indicts man's violations of the sanctity of wildlife and the forest, demands the kind of naturalistic treatment which Disney was intent upon developing in the early 1940's. Yet, such an ambition was not without its pit- falls, as Christopher Finch points out: We are not surprised, for instance, when Pinocchio is seduced from the straight and narrow by a fox and a cat, for they are clearly caricatures of human types and the story unfolds in a fantastic dimension which we recognize as a meta- phor for reality rather than as a naturalistic portrayal. Even the animals and birds in Snow White do not disturb us by their intelligent behavior. Within the framework of the fairy tale it seems quite acceptable, and only relatively small demands are made on them- they are not even asked to speak. Prior to Bambi, Disney's use of humanized animals had always been within the limits of es- tablished idioms. Bambi, however, is something quite different. This film aims for a kind of naturalism which falls outside the borders of fantasy and fairy tale- yet it pre- sents an owl on friendly terms with baby rabbits who, in the real forest, would be his victims, and we are asked to believe in deer that speak the language and share the emotions of the humans who are supposed to be their enemies. It is very difficult to reconcile these contradictions.^ For years critics have lamented Disney's making cartoons look as much like real life as possible, and some have contended that the multiplane camera with its ability to create the perfect illusion of depth dictated to Disney his commercial and artistic future.10 Similarly, the choice of Bambi was as logi- cal as it was reductive and initiated a new part for the role of darkness in the Disney Look. "Man," to quote Bambi's mother, is the villain of this film. And man, para- doxically, never achieves humanization, in that we never actually see a human character, only visual (fire) and auditory (gunfire) indications of his destruc- tive opposition to the beauty and tranquility of nature. Balancing this depic- tion of man and civilization, there is the humanization of animals and ennobling of nature. A significant shift in Disney's handling of the dark forces takes place in Bambi : no longer does a darkness emanate from mysterious forces in na- ture, but instead assumes the completely externalized form traditional to the romantic answer to the civilization-nature question; in that scenario, one at</page><page sequence="6">Darkness in Disney /99 least as old as Montaigne's speculations about the cannibals, evil comes not from within but without, from the myriad forms and practices of a corrupting society which stands in opposition to the pristine innocence of an uncompli- cated nature. Curiously, however, the film's anthropomorphism creates the eerie feeling that the dark "man" forces, inhumanly disembodied, seek to de- stroy the "human" animal world. The Disney Look, in its idealization of na- ture, its cute and majestically animated creatures, inadvertently suggests a strange mixture of attitudes, although in Bambi dictated perhaps by the source's social didacticism and a concomitant reminder to the reader that animals are living creatures and therefore sacred. In order to accomplish the book's pur- poses, Disney moves toward a greater externalization in his handling of the dichotomy of good and evil, reducing in the process a visual and moral rich- ness found in earlier features. Fire, in truth, may be the visualized villain in this film; that campfire seen at a distance and associated with man comes to occupy an enormously threat- ening presence on the screen. Yet, as Leonard Maltin suggests, the stylized animation used for the raging fire, one reminiscent of an episode in the "Rite of Spring" in Fantasia, "goes against the grain of the film, and clashes with the meticulously drawn forest and the animals that the flames pursue."1 1 Perhaps the Disney animators, aware that the film lacked real menace, resorted to a style which had worked before without realizing that Bambi was a har- binger of future directions for the portrayal of darkness rather than a compila- tion of established idioms. The stepmother and Lucifer the cat in Cinderella (1950) continue the Disney tendency toward increasing externalization in the treatment of evil. Rather than embellishing the villainy of the principal antagonist, as was the case in Snow White, Disney chooses to soften the Perrault original. There, the stepmother's evil resembles that of the Wicked Queen's in Grimm : an intense and irrational hatred of her stepdaughter's beauty and goodness, coupled with sadistic pleasure in the subjugation of "Cinder-slut." Such fairy-tale villains, of course, symbolize the false parent, while the fairy godmother provides a counter-vision of a maternal and protective goodness in nature. On the other hand, Perrault's tale contains considerably less darkness and grimness than others in his collection. The Cinderella story did provide Disney with both a well-known children's classic and a source easily adaptable to a preference for a charming uniformity in style over the clashing hues of Snow White and Pinocchio. The stepmother, in herself, appears to be a substantial villain in Disney's Cinderella. Her glowing, slanted eyes and mocking smile, animated with a fuller realism than either the Wicked Queen or Stromboli, make her a chilling presence. An early scene, for instance, shows her inhabiting a world of dark- ness, her fierce eyes peering at Cinderella from an inner sanctum. Yet, her villainy is constantly undercut by several methods, principally through the figure of her feline surrogate, Lucifer. A marvelous Disney creation, Lucifer parallels in the animal world of the film the wicked stepmother's thoroughly humanized evil and contributes to the softening of her impact. Lucifer is pet- ulant, loutish, and vicious enough, except throughout we realize his domesticity makes him a comic-villainous foil for the film's enlarged household animal ac- tion. In truth, the action developing the conflict between Lucifer and the mice almost steals the show. Lucifer's overweight and bumbling evil sufficiently</page><page sequence="7">1 00/ Darkness in Disney caricaturizes him so that we view his villainy as belonging to an overstuffed house pet spoiled by too much milk and easy, upperclass living. Lucifer's animal cunning, therefore, has been corrupted by a human vanity and sloth familiar to manners comedy. Naturally, we cheer for the proletariat mice and the fairy-tale aspirations of Cinderella, representing as they do that special society known as Disney democracy. In addition to the entertaining and caricatured animal subplot, the two ugly stepsisters provide just enough slapstick humor to further relax the evil step- mother's controlling influence. After all, she has no evil potions or freakish goon-squad to call upon; in fact, she cannot even manage to keep a key safe from the local mice. Her power cannot withstand the sparkle and magic of the fairy godmother, even though the latter, a long way from the celestial im- manence suggested by the Blue Fairy in Pinocchio, embodies a less than com- petent domesticity like that found in Lucifer's villainy. The fairy godmother's jovial and absent-minded good nature comes off as a bit too sticky, that extra helping of the cute and charming which irritates rather than entertains. Along with the softer and less dramatic clash of light and dark, Cinderella displays in its animation a love for both a naturalism and a pleasant idealiza- tion. Disney offers us an attractive surface world on which our eyes are invited to skate, but without the excitement provided by a danger of falling into the visual depths common to earlier features. Cinderella abounds in inventive devices and clever bits of business, yet nothing startles or challenges our reac- tions. The villains are neither foreboding or compelling, the positive characters resemble idealized mannequins, the backgrounds lack mystery and, as the human characters become more like mechanisms, the animals assume higher degrees of anthropomorphism. Yet, despite these developments, Cinderella remains an entertaining and charming trifle. For Walt Disney, Alice in Wonderland (1951) neither entertained nor charmed. It is well known that Disney came to dislike this film so much that he withdrew it from distribution for over twenty years. He felt it had no heart; others objected to its episodic plot and uneven mixture of surrealistic and Disney Look imagery. Today, Alice does not seem all that irredeemable. The pleasantly attractive look of Cinderella continues into Alice, especially in the characterization of Alice and the framing episodes at the beginning and end- ing. In the wonderland sequences, however, surrealistic animation clashes with Disney naturalism. Arthur Knight, for one, objected to Alice for its liter- alism and the fact that it was a cartoon that did not look like a cartoon.12 Yet, cartoon vignettes exist in the film, such as the M ad- Hatter 's tea party and the Walrus and the Carpenter episode. An element missing from Alice, one which may be responsible for its unpopularity with Disney and early critics, is a sustained and fully embodied force of darkness. No evil queen or wicked stepmother pursues Alice through the twisted corridors of wonder- land; instead, as she moves from one adventure to another, Alice encounters confusion more than she does danger. Only the Queen of Hearts is a traditional villain and, especially for a young audience, her madly frenetic and unpredict- able form of "jabberwocky" is startling and unsettling. Yet, her part is small and represents only another of the many confusions common to wonderland. To fully appreciate Disney's Alice in Wonderland and the function of its dark forces, an audience first must understand the Lewis Carroll fiction and the conventions of nonsense literature. Wonderland, in this genre, represents</page><page sequence="8">Darkness in Disney /101 a nightmare world of ¡Mogie- a bad dream which assumes its own mad logic. To evaluate this upside-down world with the definitions provided by the fa- miliar world above ground would be an exercise in futility. One reason for the unsettling quality of Disney's Alice comes from his audience's unfamiliarity with the conventions of nonsense literature. The fairy tale world created by Disney animators, the one charmingly depicted in the beginning and ending of Alice, represents a recognizable and comfortable reality for the audience. In that world, experience divides into exclusive categories of good and evil, a clash of light and dark held together between the bookends of "once upon a time" and "they lived happily ever after." Nonsense literature, on the other hand, suggests that our rational and familiar world, the one held together by a predictable order of rules and conventions, disguises from us the fact that our world is a fiction. Carroll makes his Alice episodic, as Disney does, for to do otherwise would suggest that experience exhibits a logical coherence. Alice fails to comprehend the meaning of her encounters in wonderland, since to do so would vitiate Carroll's intentions. What this suggests, I imagine, is that Disney picked the wrong story, both for his own purposes and his audience's expectations. In his earlier films, Disney clearly identified his dark elements, embodied them fully, and placed them in ready-made conventions and categories which he and his audience understood. Stromboli may suggest a form of pure evil, but that evil finds definition within a human form and exists within a narrative order which bal- ances his villainy against a supernatural benevolence. Wonderland, in contrast, lacks such balance and tidy categorization- its boundaries are closed and com- plete unto itself, making it a mad world. Disney rightly viewed Carroll's work as a classic, but wrongly as a children's classic. Disney's last fairy-tale adaptation, Sleeping Beauty (1959), would seem to muddy any theories about a "development" in the treatment of evil and darkness in the Disney Look. Maleficent, the evil witch, and her bevy of animalized grotesqueries, provide an extremely dark and menacing pres- ence. Although the force of her evil lessens through the bunglings of her caricaturized goons, Maleficent would seem to recall the Wicked Queen of Snow White , especially during that episode when she transforms herself into a huge, fire-breathing dragon. Whatever intensity Maleficent's cadaverous darkness creates finds some relief in the comic protection afforded Sleeping Beauty by the three good fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Meriwether. This domes- ticated supernatural trinity merely duplicates thrice the fairy godmother from Cinderella. Sleeping Beauty, moreover, lacks the elaborate subplot business supplied by the animals in Cinderella , which should intensify the terror of Maleficent's dark powers. Yet, strangely, Sleeping Beauty turns out to be much less frightening than Snow White , Pinocchio , or Alice in Wonderland. And the possible reasons for this may provide an interesting insight into the role of darkness in the Disney Look. The style of Sleeping Beauty , with its elaborate and detailed backgrounds, the realistic and idealized drawings of Sleeping Beauty and Prince Charming, and the wide-screen panorama, creates what Christopher Finch rightly sees as a "terrible disparity between form and content."13 The film's ornate and static pictorial animation produces a densely rococo imagery which distances and alienates the audience from its content. Sleeping Beauty , in many ways, represents a complete exercise in style, the culmination of Disney's interest in</page><page sequence="9">1 02/ Darkness in Disney extending both the naturalistic and stylized properties of his art. When, moreover, the film mixes in the charming style developed in Cinderella , as in the cottage scenes with Beauty and her three protectresses, the audience might experience even more emotional confusion, both in terms of empathy for the plight of goodness and antipathy toward the forces of antagonism. Of course, even with the earlier features, the audience knew it was watching a movie- an animated one at that- as we now do even when watching the documentary realism of a Costra-Gavras, yet that empathetic suspension of a disbelief, especially in children, still takes place during the crucible of a Pinocchio's journey toward a shared dream. Not so, however, with Sleeping Beauty , which may be an indication that for Disney his darker treatments of evil were always a matter of style and technique, never of vision. A more significant indication of changes in the Disney handling of dark- ness and villainy can be found in those features which have come to represent the Disney Look from the 1950's into the 1970's, namely Peter Pan (1953), Lady and the Tramp (1955), 101 Dalmatians (1961), The Jungle Book (1967), The Aristocats (1970), and Robin Hood (1973). In these films, dark- ness has been eliminated and the villains, even interesting ones like Cruella de Vil in 101 and Sir Hiss in Robin Hood , have assumed complete human or animal caricaturization. The animation increasingly takes on an idealized literalism as Disney begins to adapt stories which are placed in a recognizable period and locale. The Disney Look becomes more uniform and familiar, as in the London of Peter Pan and 101 , the New England town of Lady and the Tramp , the Paris of The Aristocats, environments uncomplicated by the dark, antagonistic ambience found in Snow White and Pinocchio. Never-Never Land and the Isle of the Lost Boys does not clash that much with the storybook realism of London. No frightening wonderland challenges the Disney Look. Even the villainy of important antagonists, such as Cruella and the butler in The Aristocats , have not only been caricaturized, but socialized. No longer do the Disney films explore the suggestions of darkness within nature or human nature- now, Cruella, with her chic clothes, her cigarette holder, and her serpentine limousine, asserts a complete social objectification of evil. The Disney Look may still provide some marvelous entertainment and, on occa- sion some welcome social satire, but it no longer arrests either the light or dark sides of the imagination. NOTES 1 Two invaluable sources which trace these developments, and many others, are Leonard Maltin's The Disney Films (New York, 1973) and Christopher Finch's The Art of Walt Disney (New York, 1973). 2 See Richard Schickel, The Disney Version (New York, 1968), and Wesley Marx, "The Disney Imperative," Nation , July 28, 1969, 76-78, who defines his capitalized iconograph in the following manner: "It is the compulsion to create artificial environ- ments in place of natural environments. Fantasy thus becomes reality, i.e., Lion Country Safari in Orange County, Calif., and residential marinas atop life-giving estuaries" (76). 3 Finch, p. 165. 4 See Joseph Campbell, "The Question of Meaning," in Grimm's Fairy Tales, revised by James Stern (New York, 1944), p. 857. 5 Reprinted in Finch, p. 169.</page><page sequence="10">Darkness in Disney /1 03 6 See Maltin, who makes an important distinction in answering those who dislike the post-multiplane camera realism in Disney: "What these critics miss is the fact that Disney never favored realism in his cartoons at all; rather, it was an idealization of real life, which was made possible by this technical advance" (13). 7 Finch, p. 214. 8 Fantasia (1940) is not included in this discussion, although it contains some startling images of darkness and evil. However, because it lacks a sustained story, and therefore a developed conflict between good and evil, I see Fantasia as occupying a special place in the Disney film canon. As an experiment in style and technique, on the other hand, Fantasia looks forward to Sleeping Beauty (1959). 9 Finch, pp. 269-270. ^ See, for instance, Arthur Knight, "Up from Disney," Theatre Arts (August 1951), 32, and Schickel, pp. 171-227. 11 Maltin, p. 56. 12 "Up from Disney," p. 32. 13 Finch, p. 300.</page></plain_text>
