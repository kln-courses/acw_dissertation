Professor of Old Testament Exegesis Faculty of Theology - K.U.Leuven Sint-Michielsstraat 6 B-3000 Leuven hans.ausloos@theo.kuleuven.be In memory of Prof. Dr. C.H.W. Brekelmans (1922-2004), my 'Doktorgroßvater' Summary Within current scholarly research, the enigma of a so-called encompassing Deu- teronomistic redaction or composition of the Tetrateuch occupies a prominent position. In dealing with J.W. Colenso's theory on a Deuteronomistic reworking of Genesis-Numbers, this contribution aims at disclosing one of the fundaments of this tendency. The first part of this article will present Colenso's general view on the origins and composition of the Pentateuch and the book of Joshua. The second part offers for the first time an exhaustive inventory of all passages within Genesis-Numbers that the bishop of Natal considered to be Deuteronomistic. In addition, we will cri- tically analyse his arguments for Deuteronomistic reworking.

The year 2003 saw the 150th anniversary celebration of John William Colenso's consecration as missionary bishop of Natal (South Africa)1. For the occasion, which was not without the aim of reversing the bishop's excommunication in 1866, a collection of essays was publi- shed, dealing with several aspects of Colenso's career as bishop, edu- cator and, not least, biblical scholar2. For, from the moment of his arrival in South Africa, it was the first part of the Christian Bible, and specifically the so-called Hexateuch (Genesis to Joshua), which played an active part of his life and even made it change course3. 1 1853 was a pivotal year in Colenso's life. In that year he gave up his career as mathe- matics tutor at Cambridge and vicar at Norfolk (England) to accept the offer of the new bishopric of Natal, which, together with that of Grahamstown, was originally part of the see of Capetown. After a short stay in his diocese at the beginning of 1854, Colenso arrived in Natal on 20 May 1855. He was 41 years old and was accompanied by his wife, Sarah Frances Bunyon, and their daughter, Frances Ellen. Although Colenso would return several times to England, he remained in South-Africa for the rest of his life (cf. in this respect J.W. COLENSO, Ten Weeks in Natal , Cambridge, 1855).

Decades before the theme of an encompassing 'Deuteronomistic' redaction had even become a concept in Old Testament scholarly research, Colenso's special attention to the similarities between parts in Genesis-Numbers and the book of Deuteronomy was a constant element of his activity as biblical exegete. To put it more strongly, Colenso is in fact the first Old Testament scholar to deal with such a surrounding 'Deuteronomistic' redaction of the Tetrateuch. Moreover, his exegetical theory on the lite- rary origins of the Pentateuch makes him - together with the Catholic scholar Alexander Geddes, some decades earlier - one of the most important 19th century British Old Testament scholars4. In order to situate Colenso's interest in the Deuteronomist, the first part of this contribution will concisely summarise Colenso's view on the origins and composition of the Pentateuch and the book of Joshua in general. In this we have to take account that his insights underwent change several times, due to the long time-span of eighteen years in which his seven-volume work on the first six books of the Old Testa- ment were published5.

COLENSO AND THE ORIGINS OF THE PENTATEUCH Making reference to the original intention of the Anglican Church to be "a free, Protestant, nation", Colenso considers it to be his task, "as in the days of the Reformation, to protest against all perversion of the Truth, and all suppression of it, for the sake of Peace, or by mere Autho- rity"7. As can be read passim in Colenso's work, this quest for truth is his sole guide, even when it brings him into conflict with his ecclesias- tical hierarchy in England or South Africa. Upon familiarising himself with the Zulu language during the first years of his stay amidst the Zulu population in Natal, which resulted in the publication of some very important works on their language8, Colenso aimed at making a Zulu translation of the Old and New Testa- ments. During his translation activity, in which he was assisted by "a simple minded, but intelligent native, - one with the docility of a child, but the reasoning powers of mature age"9, he encountered many histo- rical inconsistencies and contradictions within the Old Testament to which he had never paid attention. Stimulated by the critical remarks of his Zulu assistants, not only with regard to some impossibilities in the text, but also concerning its immorality10, Colenso began his precarious (for his time) search for truth in the first volume of The Pentateuch n. Here he pointed out the lack of historical accuracy within the books of Exodus and Numbers. While in 19th century England doubts as to the historicity of the Genesis narratives on creation, the fall and deluge were often circumvented by recourse to allegorical teaching, the Anglican church did not raise any serious questions, either with regard to the Mosaic authorship or the historicity of the stories in the book of Exodus dealing with Israel's slavery in Egypt and their departure12. Thus Colenso's considerations on the number of Israelites participating in the Exodus and the repetition of the sacrificial charge to the three priests Aaron, Eleazar and Ithamar 7 COLENSO, The Pentateuch , Vol. 1 (n. 3), pp. xxxiii-xxxiv. 8 In 1859 Colenso published a grammar of Zulu language, followed by a Zulu-English dictionary in 1861. 9 COLENSO, The Pentateuch , Vol. 1 (n. 3), p. vii. 10 Cf. Le ROUX, A Story of Two Ways (n. 1), pp. 94-95. 11 Colenso busied himself with the final text of the Pentateuch, thus not paying much attention to text-critical matters (cf. COLENSO, The PentateucĶ Vol. 2 (n. 3), p. 163; compare, however, with The PentateucĶ Vol. 7, Appendix (n. 3), p. 151: "The LXX shows the original form of this passage [Gen 47,4b - H.A.]). 12 COLENSO, The PentateucĶ Vol. 1 (n. 3), pp. xxi-xxii.</page><page sequence="5">376 HANS AUSLOOS in the desert are worth mentioning13. It must be stated that Colenso was not the first to claim that Moses was not the author of the whole Pen- tateuch, or to raise awareness as to the non-historicity of what is recounted in it14. Nevertheless, his extreme stress on the unhistorical character of Genesis-Deuteronomy provided a real impetus to the deve- lopment of the classical documentary hypothesis, in which Herman Hupfeld's Grundschrift (E1) was no longer accepted as the oldest part of Genesis-Numbers15. At a point when Karl Heinrich Graf and Willem Hendrik Kosters - the pioneers of criticising the antiquity of the Grund- schrift by dating some legal and narrative parts of it as post-exilic - still accept a Grundschrift 16, Colenso is arguing that especially those texts in 13 COLENSO, The Pentateuch , Vol. 1 (n. 3), esp. pp. 102-106; 122-130. Defending himself against several reviewers of the first volume of The Pentateuch , Colenso admitted that his objections against the accuracy of the Pentateuch were not at all innovative: "The very point, indeed, of my argument in part I was this, - that these difficulties were not new , though many of them were new to me, when I first began to engage in these investigations, as, Ī believe, notwithstanding the assertions of not a few of my critics, they were new to very many of my readers, lay and clerical, when first laid before them" (The Pentateuch , Vol. 2 (n. 3), p. vii). 14 See already the contestation of Mosaic authorship by T. Hobbes, R. Simon, H.B. Witter and J. Astruc during 17th and 18th century. Following their trail, the old documentary hypo- thesis (J.G. Eichhorn and K.D. Ilgen), as well as the fragmentary hypothesis (A. Geddes and J.S. Vater) and 19th century supplementary hypotheses (W.M.L. De Wette, J. J. Stähelin and A. Knobel) considered the Pentateuch as the result of a complicated process of composition. Their insights into the literary origins of Genesis-Numbers, together with their doubts as to the historical reliability of these books, however, were often rejected or at least silenced by official church doctrine. Consequently, for Colenso, these doubts about the historicity of the Pentateuch were new. Cf. COLENSO, The Pentateuch , Vol. 1 (n. 3), p. xiv: "And, though these views are, comparatively speaking, new to me, - and will be new, as I believe, to most of my English readers, even to many of the Clergy, of whom, probably, few have examined the Pen- tateuch closely since they took Orders, while parts of it some of them may never really have studied at all, - yet I am by this time well aware that most of the points here considered have been already brought forward, though not exactly in the present form, by various continental writers, with whom the critical and scientific study of the Scriptures has made more progress than it has yet done in England". Ibid., pp. vi -vii: "Engrossed with parochial and other work in England, I did what, probably, many other clergyman have done under similar circum- stances, - I contented myself with silencing, by means of the specious explanations, which are given in most commentaries, the ordinary objections against the historical character of the early portions of the Old Testament, and settled down into a willing acquiescence in the general truth of the narrative, whatever difficulties might still hang about particular parts of it. In short, the doctrinal and devotional portions of the Bible were what were needed most in parochial duty. And, if a passage of the Old Testament formed at any time the subject of a sermon, it was easy to draw from it practical lessons of daily life, without examining closely into the historical truth of the narrative."

COLENSO AND THE DEUTERONOMIST 377 Genesis-Numbers, which most expressively put themselves forward as authentic and claim to be the most accurate, are in reality the most unhistorical, even though one would normally expect to discover the most accurate and faithful information in the oldest documents17. None- theless, still accepting the majority opinions as to the date and the cha- racter of the Grundschrift , Colenso will refuse to draw the inferences from his demonstration of the unhistorical character of most of the Grundschrift. It will be Abraham Kuenen who, explicitly referring to the bishop of Natal, will consider the entire Grundschrift to be one of the youngest parts of the Pentateuch, and this because, "with one single exception the twenty chapters of his [= Colenso's] book are devoted to an absolutely pulverising criticism of the data of the 'Grundschrift'"18. Thus, as a result, the historicity of Pentateuchal narratives had already begun to crumble by the first volume of Colenso's The Penta- teuch and, providing thereby the catalyst towards historical-critical research, offered a stimulus to searching for the origin of Genesis- Numbers in the second volume onwards. After having pointed to some elements which indicate that the final redaction of the Pentateuch and the book of Joshua must be later than the time of Moses, Colenso ela- borates his theory on the composition of the Pentateuch based on the book of Genesis. He is undoubtedly a proponent of the classical 19th century supplementary hypothesis, considering it to be very unli- 17 With one exception, the twenty chapters of Colenso's first part of The Pentateuch consist of a (pulverising) detailed criticism of the historical reliability of passages from the Grundschrift. 18 See the introduction to the English translation of his Historisch-critisch onderzoek naar het ontstaan en de verzameling van de boeken des Ouden Verbonds , Deel 1 : De thora en de historische boeken des Ouden Verbonds , Amsterdam, 21884: An Historico- Critical Inquiry into the Origin and Composition of the Hexateuch , Translated from the Dutch, with the Assistance of the Author by P.H.

En wat betreft de in Duitschland heerschende beschouwing - wanneer het zieh laat aantoonen, dat Ewald, Bunsen, Bleek en Knobel, één voor één, door den Engeischen bisschop in de noodzakelijkheid worden gebracht om hunne theorieën te herzien, dan heeft men waarlijk geen reden om zijne methode verouderd en zijne bedenkingen afgesleten te noemen".

HOUTMAN, Colenso as Seen by Kuenen , and as Known from Colenso's Letters to Kuenen , in DRAPER, The Eye of the Storm (n. 2), pp. 76-103, esp. pp. 87-92.</page><page sequence="7">378 HANS AUSLOOS kely that two separate narratives, each complete in itself, should have been framed independently of each other, along very similar lines dealing with precisely the same topics in the exact same order, such topics being partly mythical, legendary and fictitious, but in any case certainly not matters of real traditional history. Therefore, Colenso finds it far more likely that later writers would supplement an older narrative, if they did not altogether rewrite it in their own style. As such, he is of the opinion that the basic document has been composed by the Elohist. It had presumably been supplemented by the 'Jehovisť, who enlarged, amended and illustrated the work of the older writer19. Colenso is thus not really developing a new theory on the origins of the Pentateuch, but he builds upon foundations that had already been laid20. Colenso's main argument in distinguishing between Elohist and 'Jehovisť consists in referring to the divine names DTiVk and mrn ('Jehovah'). He tentatively identifies the author of the Elohistic basic narrative, in which God is exclusively called □"TI1?**, with the prophet Samuel21. Moreover, Colenso holds that Samuel was equally the one introducing the tetragram as a new name for the God of Israel which, incidentally, did not exist before Samuel's time. Colenso's argument in favour of this hypothesis is twofold. Firstly, within the book of Judges, there is no single name which is compounded with mm22, while there are several names composed with the divine name Within the books of Samuel, on the contrary, names compounded with mm are used fre- quently23. Secondly, Colenso refers to the fact that king David in his 'earlier' Psalms24, which he would have composed before he had become king25, made little or no use of the tetragram, while in his later 19 COLENSO, The Pentateuch , Vol. 2 (n. 3), pp. 175-185. Colenso has probably been influenced by Friedrich Bleek's Einleitung in die Heilige Schrift, Berlin, 1860-1862. It is, moreover, thanks to Bleek's son, Wilhelm, who was curator of the library in Cape Town, that Colenso was able to obtain several European exegetical works. 20 In volumes 5 and 6, however, the bishop will eo his own wav. 21 COLENSO, The Pentateuch , Vol. 2 (n. 3), pp. 223-229; 358. Colenso states that three out of the four names which seem to be compounded with mrr - /oash (6,11), /otham (9,5,) Micah = Michaia/i (17,1) and Jonathan (18,30) - cannot in fact be considered as such. With regard to the name Jonathan, Colenso argues that it only occurs in pericopes which have been written in the later days of Samuel (COLENSO, The Pen- tateuch i, Vol. 2 (n. 3), pp. 330-343, esp. pp. 333-334). 23 COLENSO, The Pentateuch , Vol. 2 (n. 3), pp. 344-352. 24 Cf. COLENSO, The Pentateuch , Vol. 2 (n. 3), p. 270: "(...) supposing that these Psalms were really written by David, whether he wrote them on the occasions mentioned in the titles, or not, and even if they were not written by David at all, but by some other person of that ager 25 COLENSO, The Pentateuch , Vol. 2 (n. 3), pp. 267-272.</page><page sequence="8">J.W. COLENSO AND THE DEUTERONOMIST 379 Psalms he uses it freely26. On the basis of these considerations, Colenso concludes that the 'Jehovisť was writing in a period when the divine name míT was commonly used and persons' names were compounded with it on a regular basis. In Colenso's view, this could not have hap- pened earlier than in the latter part of David's life. Moreover, the 'Jeho- visť could hardly have lived a long time after Samuel and his introduction of the name H VP, since, although he freely uses the divine name mn' the prophet only compounds two names - /oshua and /ochebed - with the tetragram27. Thus, according to Colenso, all por- tions in Genesis-Numbers and Joshua which do not stem from the Elohist and with the exception of some Deuteronomistic interpolations - he considers the book of Deuteronomy to be written in the time of king Josiah, probably by the prophet Jeremiah - were composed by one or more 'Jehovistic' writers who wrote in the latter days of David and in the early part of Solomon's reign28. After having analysed Gen 1-11 in Part 4 of The Pentateuch29, a slightly refined hypothesis on the origins of Genesis-Joshua is given in the fifth part. Dealing almost exclusively with the book of Genesis in 1865, Colenso follows H. Hupfeld's distinction within Elohistic mate- rial. Thus, besides an 'ihvhisť, he distinguishes between a main Elohist and a younger, second Elohist30. On three points, however, Colenso disagrees with Hupfeld. First, while the latter regards the younger Elo- histic and the 'ihvhistic' sections as an original, complete, independent and continuous work, Colenso was convinced that the Elohistic basic narrative had been supplemented by a second Elohist (E2), in a similar way that J had supplemented E or E2, or D had supplemented the EJ narrative31. Second, within the 'Jehovistic' portions of the Pentateuch, Colenso distinguishes Jl9 J2, J3 and J4, while Hupfeld accepts one single Jehovist32. Third, E2 is not considered to be a different author from the 26 COLENSO, The Pentateuch , Vol. 2 (n. 3), pp. 273-329. 27 COLENSO, The Pentateuch , Vol. 2 (n. 3), pp. 244-352. For the name Mońah in Gen 22,2, cf. ibid ., pp. 240-247. 28 COLENSO, The Pentateuch , Vol. 2 (n. 3), pp. 358-359. 29 Pages 14-90 mainly consists of a demonstration of the composite character of Gen 1- 11. In the following pages (91-284), Colenso gives a section by section analysis of Gen 1-11, in which it is his main purpose to demonstrate that these chapters may not be read literally. 30 Cf. H. HUPFELD, Die Quellen der Genesis und die Art ihrer Zusammensetzung von neuem untersucht , Berlin, 1853. 31 COLENSO, The Pentateuch , Vol. 5 (n. 3), p. 180. 32 COLENSO, The PentateucĶ Vol. 5 (n. 3), pp. 48-52; 187-195. The distinction between J,, J2, J3 and J4 is mainly based on the fact whether the divine names mrr and have been</page><page sequence="9">380 HANS AUSLOOS 'Jehovisť, but, by identifying him with Jj, he represents J at an earlier stage of his literary activity33. Besides J and E, Colenso deals with what he calls the Later Editor , which according to him, can be identified with the Deuteronomist. The Deuteronomist not only enlarged the EJ Tetra- teuch with the addition of the book of Deuteronomy; he also edited, revised and retouched the existing Tetrateuch34. Colenso's attempt to connect the different authors of the Pentateuch to specific figures as he did in the second volume by linking E to Samuel and D to Jeremiah, is further developed in the fifth volume by relating J to Nathan and J2 to Gad35. Although he does not maintain that those persons themselves were actually the authors of Genesis- Numbers, he is convinced that the respective portions of the Pentateuch must have been written by "some great and good men - as great and good as these - leading men of the respective ages", since "no other writers of history out of those ages are named in the Bible"36. Colenso's hypothesis on the origins of the Pentateuch as presented in his fifth part can be summarised as follows: Eļ 1100-1060 (in the days of) Samuel J Jļ (= E2) 1060-1010 Nathan (in the latter part of Saul's reign) J2 1035 in the second decade of David's reign (Gad) J3 in the latter part of David's reign J4 in the beginning of Solomon's reign D 641-624 Jeremiah Between the publication of the fifth and the sixth part of The Penta- teuch , Colenso's opinion on the origins of the Pentateuch changed significantly. This was undoubtedly caused by his investigations of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Joshua, which are comprised of much legal and cultic material. The starting point of his analysis of these books is Lev 26. Because this chapter, and, in extensu Lev 18-20, share used more freely or not. For example, in J3 and J4, the tetragrammaton is used almost exclu- sively as the name for God, whereas J2 has 7 times míT and 67 times or bx. 33 COLENSO, The Pentateuch , Vol. 5 (n. 3), pp. 58-68. 34 COLENSO, The Pentateuch , Vol. 5 (n. 3), pp. 52-57. 35 See COLENSO, The Pentateuch , Vol. 5 (n. 3), p. 180. Compare, however, with p. 195: "It is possible, of course, that (...) J', J2, J3, J4, may have been written my more than one hand in the slightly-different ages to which we assign them, - as this would sufficiently account for the similarity of style which exists between them. But there are no distinct indications of this. And the interval of 40 years, assigned as the duration of David's reign (...) would allow of the same writer (Nathan, suppose) having written the first of these sets of passages under Saul at the age of 20, and the last under Solomon at the age of 70". 36 COLENSO, The Pentateuch (n. 3), Vol. 5, p. 180.</page><page sequence="10">J.W. COLENSO AND THE DEUTERONOMIST 381 a lot of expressions and vocabulary with the prophetic book Ezekiel37, which are not found elsewhere in the Old Testament, Colenso concludes that these chapters must apparently have been written by Ezekiel during the first years of king Jehoiachin's captivity38. Ezekiel's work was taken up during the Babylonian Exile by various Priestly writers, who supplemented Genesis-Joshua with typical Priestly mate- rial. These elements are labelled as the Later or Levitical Legislation (L.L.). Colenso detects the extent of L.L. within Genesis-Joshua by investi- gating the book of Deuteronomy again. He argues that the original form of this book consisted of chapters 5-26; 28. Chapters 1-4; 27; 29-30 were added later by the same hand, while chapters 31-34 also contain Deuteronomistic material, but mixed with passages of very different age and authorship39. For Colenso, it is evident that the Deuteronomist was familiar with several parts of the story of the Exodus narrative, since he repeatedly makes allusion to itē Because Deuteronomy does not mention other parts, such as the accounts of the construction of the Ark and the Tabernacle in Exod 25,1-31,17 and 35-40, these episodes could not have formed part of what Colenso calls the Original Story (O.S.) - i.e. the EJ story - but must have been written at a later stage than Deuteronomy, and thus during or after the Exile, together with all the material in the rest of the Pentateuch, which assumes the existence of these cultic objects40. Having identified the L.L. passages in the Pentateuch, Colenso sets out to reconstruct the above-mentioned O.S. in Exodus, Numbers, Deu- teronomy and Joshua. Within the O.S., he still discerns an Elohistic basic narrative - its conclusion can be found in Exod 6,2-541 - which was then supplemented by several Jehovistic writers. When the O.S. was completed, most likely in King Solomon's early years, the work 37 According to Colenso, a careful analysis reveals that almost every peculiar expression in Lev 26 has its counterpart or even its exact parallel in the book of Ezekiel, while many of these do not occur elsewhere in the Old Testament. Compare e.g. Lev 26,6 with Ezek 34,28; 39,26. 38 COLENSO, The Pentateuch (n. 3), Vol. 6, pp. 3-23. 39 COLENSO, The Pentateuch (n. 3), Vol. 6, pp. 24-33. 40 COLENSO, The Pentateuch (n. 3), Vol. 6, pp. 43-44. 41 According to Colenso, in the Elohistic document the foundation was laid for the story of the Exodus, but it was never completed by the Elohist, possibly due to his sickness or death, or perhaps because he had written what he conceived to be the most important and difficult portion of the narrative, and, having brought it to the critical moment of the reve- lation of the divine name mn' left it now to be filled and continued by younger hands (COLENSO, The Pentateuch , Vol. 6 (n. 3), pp. 616-617).</page><page sequence="11">382 HANS AUSLOOS remained untouched, and perhaps lay deposited beside the ark in the temple until Jeremiah, Le . the Deuteronomist, who as a priest of the temple would very probably have had free access to this manuscript, retouched and enlarged it in his own prophetical style, and ultimately inserted his own work - Deuteronomy - into it. Finally, as already men- tioned, the work was enlarged with the L.L. by Ezekiel and the Priestly writers who followed in his footsteps. Four years before his death, in the seventh and last volume of The Pentateuch , Colenso investigates the authorship of the books of Judges, Samuel and Kings. He also concisely analyses several other Old Testa- ment books, such as Chronicles, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles and the book of Psalms. On the question of the origin and composition of the Pentateuch, the appendices of the seventh volume are of major importance. In Appendix 152, Colenso surveys his approach to the origins of Genesis-Numbers42. Here he explicitly aims at defending his opinion that the narrative parts of the Elohist in Gen 1,1-Exod 6,5 are the oldest, while the legislative elements - L.L. - have to be considered as the youngest portions of the Pentateuch. Thus, although Colenso played an important role with regard to the dating of the so-called Priestly material - we already indicated that Kuenen admitted explicitly that it was Colenso who had put him on the right track - he is unable to follow Kuenen regarding the unity of laws and narratives of what he calls P. On the contrary, Colenso retains his faith in the theory of a Grundschrift . In sum, Colenso's final view on the origin of the Pentateuch, in which he still favoured a supplementary hypothesis, can be outlined as follows. The basic Elohistic narrative (E), which can be traced back to Gen 1,1-Exod 6,5, was developed in Saul's time, and was most probably written by, or at least on the authority of, Samuel (1100-1060 B.C.). The Second Elohist (£) and the Jahwist (J) - who may perhaps have been the same writer at different stages of literary activity - supplemented the basic E-narrative. They/he wrote at intervals during David's time, including the last years of Saul and the first years of Solomon (1060- 1010 B.C.). While the materials of the Second Elohist before Exod 6,5 are merely fragmentary, after Exod 6,5 it forms a continuous narrative, from the prediction of the divine name to the foretelling of David's conquests in Balaam's oracles. Similarly, the Jahwist in Genesis-Exodus 42 The Pentateuch , Vol. 7, pp. 129-139.</page><page sequence="12">J.W. COLENSO AND THE DEUTERONOMIST 383 is fragmentary. After Balaam's prophecy in Numbers, however, the Jah- wistic narrative forms a continuous story, coming to an end in 1 Kings 9,25. This E£J narrative was later supplemented by some fragmentary and unconnected Deuteronomistic insertions (D). Finally, this corpus was supplemented by L.L., similarly consisting of mere fragmentary pas- sages, which did not by themselves form a continuous, independent narrative, nor show any sign of having originally belonged to such a narrative. The similarities between L.L. and E may be explained by the fact that L.L., throughout the Pentateuch, employed some archaisms in order to give these insertions an appearance of antiquity. For the same reason, the author(s) of L.L. may have affected the phraseology of E, the most ancient portion of the Pentateuch. Up until now, only scant attention was paid to the Deuteronomist in Colenso's hypothesis of the origins and composition of Genesis- Numbers. Nevertheless, decades before the tendency of 'pan-Deutero- nomism' arose, Colenso is - as far as I know - the first scholar to deal with such an extensive and encompassing Deuteronomistic reworking of the Tetrateuch. In the next section of this contribution, we will inves- tigate his approach to the so-called Deuteronomistic elements within his theory of the origins and composition of Genesis-Numbers. II. Colenso and the Deuteronomist Colenso was not the first scholar to point out so-called Deuterono- mistic language within Genesis-Numbers. The 'Deuteronomistic quest' finds its origins some decades earlier, within the critical work of Frie- drich Bleek43. In fact, Bleek was the first scholar to put forward some more or less typical 'Deuteronomic' elements in the Tetrateuch. Some years later, Johann Stähelin, who was a proponent of the new developed supplementary hypothesis, identified the Jehovist, who had supple- mented the Elohistic basic narrative, with the author of Deuteronomy, thus trying to give an explanation for some loose 'Deuteronomic' inser- tions in the Tetrateuch. The first time that the 'Deuteronomisť comes to the fore in Colen- so's theory on the origins of the Pentateuch (leaving out the D portions 43 Einige aphoristische Beiträge zu den Untersuchungen über den Pentateuch, in G.H.

Within his hypothesis on the Elohistic basic narrative, its Mehovistic' supplements and the book of Deuteronomy, Colenso vaguely points to "some interpolations", of which small ones occur in the book of Genesis and larger ones in the books of Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers. In his view, all of them were caused by the Deuteronomist, who revised Genesis-Numbers and added to it almost the entire book of Deutero- nomy, his own creation. In this respect, the D-elements within Genesis- Numbers in the first volumes of The Pentateuch should in fact be termed 'Deuteronomic' instead of 'Deuteronomistic', although Colenso himself always uses this terminology45. Moreover, on the basis of the similarities between the decalogues in Exodus and Deuteronomy, Colenso stresses that the Deuteronomist was dependent on the text of Exodus, and derived his ideas and most of his expressions from it. According to Colenso, the Deuteronomist did not have as strong a sense of the sacredness as did the earlier document. This is clear from the liberty he took with respect to its contents, by altering several of its expressions and, in particular, by modifying the commandment on the Sabbath in a remarkable way46. Now, in order to identify the Deuteronomisťs hand in the Tetrateuch, Colenso considers it to be necessary to find out what precisely charac- terises Deuteronomy's style and theology. This task is fulfilled in the third volume of The Pentateuch , which deals almost exclusively with a section-by-section investigation of the book of Deuteronomy. With the exception of its last chapter47 as well as Deut 31,14*.15*48 and 44 COLENSO, The Pentateuch (n. 3), Vol. 2, pp. 358-362. 45 For a discussion of the terminology 'Deuteronomic' versus 'Deuteronomistic', cf.

Brekelmans (Bibliotheca Ephemeridum Theologicarum Lovanien- sium, 133), Leuven, 1997, pp. 341-366, esp. pp. 351-352. 46 Colenso's attempt to demonstrate that it is impossible the Pentateuch was written by one single author can be found once more in his emphasis that the language of Deutero- nomy differs so remarkably from that of the other books of the Pentateuch (COLENSO, The PentateucĶ Vol. 3, (n. 3), p. 399). 47 Deut 34,1.8 are the only instances in Deuteronomy where Moab is called 3K1Q rQ"IĪ7E, instead of 3K1Q IHK in the rest of the book. Cf. COLENSO, The PentateucĶ Vol. 3 (n. 3), p. 401. 48 Because (lînra) VnK is not used in the book of Deuteronomy with the exception of Deut 31,14.15, these verses are regarded as a fragment of the older document. The Deuteronomist never refers to the tabernacle, perhaps because he did not have it in mind daily, as he had the Ark, which he names in Deut 10,1.2.3.5.8; 31,9.25.26. Cf.

COLENSO AND THE DEUTERONOMIST 385 32,48-5249, Deuteronomy is considered to have been written by one single author, who, because of differences in style and tone, must have been very different from the Elohist or the 'Jehovisť who wrote in a dif- ferent period and were responsible for the main portions of the other books of the Pentateuch. Because of the close resemblances between the language of the Deuteronomist and that of Jeremiah, Colenso ten- tatively concludes that the two writers are identical. This means that the book of Deuteronomy is part of Jeremiah's work during the first five years of his prophetic activity50. Within the history of research into the book of Deuteronomy, Colenso is one of the first scholars to list so-called typical Deutero- nomic terminology and phraeseology51. He enumerates expressions and statements, which are repeated frequently by the Deuteronomist, but which occur only rarely, and many of them not at all, in the other books of the Pentateuch52. Vice versa Colenso itemises expressions which are commonly used in the Tetrateuch, but which are never employed in the book of Deuteronomy53. 49 COLENSO, The Pentateuch , Vol. 3 (n. 3), pp. 391-392. For Colenso, Deut 32,48-52 - with the exception of 3NTO 1HN3 "IU7K (v. 49) - is not to be ascribed to the Deuteronomist. On the contrary, because of its terminology (v. 48: HTH DVH Cm73; v. 49: mnN; pN; v. 50: ^DKm ■pOtf *?N), which also occurs in several portions of Genesis-Numbers, but nowhere in the rest of Deuteronomy, it is considered to be part of the older narrative, referring to the death of Moses and corresponding to Num 20,22-29, where Aaron's death is described in similar terms. It has only been retained in this place by the Deuteronomist (ibid., pp. 397-399; 402; 568). 50 COLENSO, The Pentateuch , Vol. 3 (n. 3), pp. 617-618: "(...) the man who could conceive, and carry out so effectively, the idea of adding another book to the existing Tetrateuch, must have been, indeed, a remarkable person. A writer of such originality, power, and eloquence, - of such earnest piety, such ardent patriotism, such tender human affections, - must have surely filled a very prominent position in the age in which he lived. As we have said, he can hardly have disappeared so completely from the stage of Jewish history, in an age when his- torical records were diligently kept, without leaving behind any other trace of his existence and activity than this book of Deuteronomy. That Jeremiah lived in this very age we know, and that he began to prophesy 4in the thirteenth year of king Josia,' Jer.i.2, four or five years before this book was found in the Temple; and we have also seen, as our investigations have advanced, not a few very striking indications of a close resemblance between the language of Jeremiah and that of the Deuteronomist".

Here too the bishop only refers to the issue in passing54. It is not till the fifth volume that Colenso will significantly develop his suggestion of a Deuteronomic 'redaction' of Genesis-Numbers. Although the verses that Colenso assigns to the Deuteronomist increase substantially from volume five of The Penta- teuch onwards, he only deals explicitly with the Deuteronomisťs aims in a few pages of his fifth volume, against the background of his ana- lysis of the Genesis narrative55. He considers it to be strange that the Deuteronomist, who had conceived the idea of adding the whole book of Deuteronomy to the existing EJ Tetrateuch would not also have revised and retouched the older narrative. This is precisely why Colenso argues that several traces of the Deuteronomisťs hand can be found in the first four books of the Pentateuch, similar to the way he attempted to demonstrate that a large portion of the book of Joshua consists of Deuteronomic material56. Because Colenso supports a supplementary hypothesis, in which the basic E narrative was supplemented by J and which never existed as an independent source, he considers the Deute- ronomist as the editor of the existing Tetrateuch, rather than its com- piler51, contrary to classical source criticism. According to the 54 "There are several (...) expressions, which occur freely in all parts of Deuteronomy, but are found also in certain well-defined portions of the other books [of the Pentateuch]; that is to say, they do not appear in all parts of these books, as they do in Deuteronomy, but only in those particular sections, limited in extent, which betray also, when carefully examined, other close affinities with the style of the Deuteronomist. We can scarcely doubt that such passages are interpolations by his hand. And, indeed, it would be strange if there were no such insertions. The writer, who could conceive the grand idea of adding the whole book of Deuteronomy to the existing roll of the Tetrateuch, would be almost certain, we may well believe, to have first revised the work of the older writers which had come into his hands, and to have inserted passages, here and there, if he saw any reason for so doing, in the ori- ginal document. The wonder, we repeat, would be, if he did not do this." (COLENSO, The Pen- tateuch , Vol. 3 (n. 3), pp. 413-414). 55 COLENSO, The Pentateuch, Vol. 5 (n. 3), pp. 52-57. 56 COLENSO, The PentateucĶ Vol. 5 (n. 3), pp. 3-11. 57 Cf. also COLENSO, The Pentateuch , Vol. 7 (n. 3), p. 135: "The insertions of the Deute- ronomist in Genesis-Joshua, which are fragmentary and unconnected, were undoubtedly written to supplement a continuous story already existing". With this position, Colenso is reacting particularly to E. Boehmer and H. Hupfeld, although they substantially agree with regard to the passages which belong to E, E2 or J. Boehmer, for example, considers the Later Editor to be responsible for the combination of the original independent narratives A (= E), B (= E2) and C (= J). Although Boehmer situates this compiler in the days of Josiah (similar to Colenso), he does not identify him with the</page><page sequence="16">J.W. COLENSO AND THE DEUTERONOMIST 387 documentary hypothesis, RD inserted Deuteronom(ist)ic vocabulary and theology while combining the JE-source with the already existing D- document. In Colenso's view, however, the Deuteronomist did not com- bined two distinct documents, but rather edited the EJ Tetrateuch with several interpolations and enlarged it with its own creation, i.e. the book of Deuteronomy. These Deuteronomic additions, which are written in the style of Deuteronomy itself, are, according to Colenso, the most spi- rited and refreshing passages of the whole Pentateuch. For the most part, these passages "seem to have been inserted for the very purpose of quickening the history with a deeper spiritual meaning, and stirring more effectually the reader's heart with words of religious life and ear- nestness"58. Colenso also suggests that the Deuteronomist may have revised the Tetrateuch as it came into his hands, before he started writing the book of Deuteronomy itself59. Colenso analyses Gen 14 as belonging neither to E, J nor D, but instead considers it the work of a separate writer (J2) because of its pecularities of style, whose hand cannot be traced to any other part of the Pentateuch. Against this background, he goes on to argue that there are some slight points of contact between J2 and D60. In this respect, the bishop already anticipates in some way the view of i.a. A. Kuenen and H. Holzinger, who, although seeing some points of contact between JE and D in several JE pericopes, did not draw the conclusion of a Deute- ronomistic origin to these texts, but, on the contrary, saw it as pointing to a close relationship between JE and D61. In the seventh volume of The Pentateuch , in which Colenso attributes even more verses to D in comparison with his former volumes, he Deuteronomist, "for the character of Deuteronomy, which has not without reason been styled as in a certain sense evangelical, is quite distinct from the spirit of the Compiler, which (...) is on the whole altogether dry and unrefreshing."

Colenso also argues that Jeremiah, in writing his D-passages in the book of Exodus, was dependent on Nahum and borrowed several phrases from this book63. In what follows, I will first offer an exhaustive survey of all (parts of) verses within Genesis-Numbers that are attributed to the Deuterono- mist in the different volumes of Colenso's magnum opus. Second, I will make some remarks with regard to the criteria and arguments he uses to ascribe (parts of) verses or whole passages to the Deuteronomist. 1. Survey of Deuteronomistic elements in Genesis-Numbers Whereas the theoretical background Colenso offers with regard to the Deuteronomist can hardly be called expansive, the number of passages he attributes to D is astonishing. In the following table, I enumerate all verses of Genesis-Numbers, which, in the several volumes of The Pen- tateuch, are considered to be Deuteronomistic additions.

It also has certain pecularities of style of its own, which seem to mark it as the work of a fourth writer, the Second Jehovist, whose hand cannot be traced in any other part of the Pentateuch. Although Gen 14 contains no distinct traces of either E, J or D, it exhibits a few points of slight resemblance to each of them. These points of contact between J2 and D are: rinnen HU717 (v. 2): cf.

Colenso's argumentation for Deuteronomistic elements in Genesis-Numbers An overview of the above table immediately reveals that the majority of pericopes or verses attributed by Colenso to D fits in perfectly with today's growing tendency of pan-Deuteronomism. It is, however, amazing that most contemporary scholars do not refer to Colenso's work or his arguments. Unlike recent research, Colenso also attributes almost the whole episode of Balaam and his donkey in Num 22-24 to D, although, as he admits, the frequent use of the divine name or crrftK - except for Num 22,22-35 where mrn is used - would at first sight point to E102. The similarities of several expressions to the books of Jeremiah, Deuteronomy, Joshua-Kings and other D-passages in the Tetrateuch lead him, however, to assign the Balaam-episode to the Deu- teronomist. It is not only passages in Genesis, Exodus and Numbers that Colenso considers to be composed by D, but, in the fifth volume of The Penta- teuch , he believes Lev 26 to be an insertion of the Deuteronomist as well103. The bishop deals with this chapter against the background of his analysis of Num 14,40-45104, where, similar to Lev 26,17, the expression 'OD1? can be found. Within the complex of Genesis-Deutero- nomy, and with the exception of Lev 26 and Num 14, this formula only occurs in Deut 1,42; 28,7.25. Thus it is that Colenso considers it to be a special property of the Deuteronomist. In the sixth volume, however, Colenso changes his opinion with regard to Lev 26. The similarities between Deuteronomy and Lev 26, which were understood as stem- ming from Ezekiel - as indicated above - are now explained in a diffe- rent way. The presence of D expressions in Lev 26 is to be expected, partly from the fact that its author knew the language of the Deutero- nomist and occasionally imitated it, and partly because he lived in the same period and moved in the same prophetic circle105. Colenso's argumentation in assigning (parts of) pericopes in Genesis- Numbers to D consists mainly of an enumeration of words and expres- sions that often or exclusively occur in Deuteronomy or in the Deuteronomistic portions of Joshua-Kings and in the book of Jeremiah. 102 COLENSO, The Pentateuch.

COLENSO AND THE DEUTERONOMIST 393 Since it is impossible to describe his arguments for every single per- icope or (part of a) verse, it will suffice here to give a few examples that are characteristic of his argumentation. As a preliminary remark, it has to be emphasised that Colenso is, generally speaking, not referring to the Hebrew text of the Old Testa- ment, but rather makes use of an English translation. This undoubtedly influences his argumentation. For example, according to Colenso, the theme of 'giants' (CTKET) or "03) is almost exclusively Deutero- nomic. As a consequence, Gen 6,4 must be D too. In order to prove this, Colenso refers to the use of the term in Deut 2,11.20.20; 3,11.13; Josh 12,4; 13,12; 17,15; 18,16 and Gen 15,20, all of which thus Deute- ronomic passages. The *72 are mentioned in Deut 1,28; 11,10.11.21; 9,2; Josh 11,21.22; 14,12.15; 15,13.14, thus all Deutero- nomic passages too, and elsewhere in the Old Testament only in Num 13,22.28.33 and Judg 1,20. However, Gen 6,4 neither uses the term nor the expression "03. The fact that term "1131 in Gen 6,4; 10,8.9.9 can be found in Deut 10,17; Josh 1,14; 6,2; 8,3; 10,2.7 - according to Colenso all D-passages - is enough for him to consider this term as typically Deuteronomistic and to conclude that the use of the term in Genesis points to the Deu- teronomist. Since the prophetic formula mrP "131 rnn (Gen 15,1.4) is used nowhere else in the Pentateuch, Colenso argues that this expression probably does not belong to J. On the contrary, it seems to be frequently applied by "Jeremiah, - the contemporary, at all events, of the Deute- ronomist - and often in places, where it must have been used by the prophet himself'. As a result, Colenso would suggest a Deuteronomistic origin to the formula106. Similarly, with regard to Num 21,28-29, Colenso points to the close similarity with Jer 47,45-46 and concludes that the Deuteronomist interpolated the narrative about Sihon and Og in the EJ narrative107. The use of circular arguments is typical of all scholarly literature arguing for an extensive Deuteronomistic activity within the Tetrateuch and accentuating the similarities of vocabulary between D-passages in Genesis-Numbers and the so-called Deuteronomistic literature108. Examples in Colenso's work are legion. Here too I will confine myself 106 The Pentateuch , Vol. 5, CA (n. 3), p. 57. According to Colenso, its use in the introduc- tory formulae in Hos 1,1; Joel 1,1; Jonah 1,1; Micah 1,1; Zeph 1,1 has been inserted perhaps by the editor or compiler of these prophecies. 107 The Pentateuch , Vol. 6 (n. 3), p. 318; Vol. 7, Appendix (n. 3), p. 168. 108 AUSLOOS, Deuteronomi(sti)sche elementen (n. 6), p. 59.</page><page sequence="23">394 HANS AUSLOOS to just a few examples. The comparison of the descendants of Israel with tratf?n in Gen 15,5 is not only considered Deuteronomistic because a similar expression occurs in Deut 1,10; 7,13; 10,22; 13,17; 28,62-63; 3,5, but also because it occurs in Gen 22,17; 26,4 and Exod 32,13, all so-called D-passages. However, in order to claim the D- character of Gen 22,17; 26,4 and Exod 32,13, Colenso refers to Gen 15,5 as a typical Deuteronomistic verse. Another example is even more astounding. The Deuteronomistic origin of the character of the mes- senger of YHWH (mrn ļN^ū) in Gen 24,7 is substantiated by its occur- rence in the so-called Deuteronomistic passages Gen 48,16; Exod 23,20.23; 32,34; 33,2, without even making reference to a pericope in Deuteronomy - where the mrn does not play a role at all! - or in Joshua-Kings. In proving the Deuteronomistic origin of e.g. Exod 23,20, Colenso then simply refers to Gen 24,7! I have elsewhere indicated the danger of using mere vocabulary or so-called stereotypical expressions as a criterion for determining texts as Deuteronomistic109, since not just the meaning of a word or expres- sion within its context, but also a meticulous comparison with its so-called typically Deuteronomistic use in Deuteronom(ist)ic literature is essential. Some years ago, I demonstrated the weakness of such a 'sta- tistic' criterion, investigating the formula which characterises the pro- mised land as UDII 3*711 H3T 1HK110. Just because of its relatively frequent attestation in the book of Deuteronomy, Colenso considers it to be a typical characteristic of the Deuteronomist. In this respect, however, he does not pay attention to the various usages of the formula in the Old Testament literature. Another example of the deficiency of this still oft- used strategy can be found in Colenso's argument on the expression mxin Vm "11 in Gen 18, 18111. Outside Deut 4,38; 7,1; 9,1.14; 11,23; 26,5; Josh 23, 9(D); Num 14,12, this formula occurs nowhere else in the Old Testament and thus, for Colenso, it must be of Deuteronomistic origin. However, a meticulous analysis of its use in Gen 18,18 necessi- tates nuancing this conclusion. (1) In Deut 4,38; 9,1; 11,23, the expres- sion □"'DStf'l Ū^IDI (plural!) refers to the indigenous population of Canaan in relation to Israel, contrary to Gen 18,18, where the descen- dants of Abraham are meant. (2) Although Deut 9,14 refers to the Israe- lites, the people is not characterised as /TU, but ITI, which, moreover, 109 Cf. AUSLOOS, Les extrêmes se touchent... (n. 46), pp. 359-360. 110 H.

In addition, similar to Deut 4,38; 9,1; 11,23, Israel is compared with the indigenous peoples. (3) Deut 7,1 ... D^ļ) does not use the adjective Vil}. Moreover, it refers explicitly to the foreign population by enumerating the indigenous Canaanite population. (4) Although Deut 26,5 (VflDl 3"l*l DIEP) does refer to the Israelites, the formula is quite different. (5) Num 14,12 is the only verse in which the formula is identical with Gen 18,18 711 } ^Dl). However, it equally compares Israel to the native population. With regard to Num 14,12, it has to be noticed that Colenso originally did not characterise this verse as Deuteronomic. Only in the seventh volume of The Pentateuch , Num 14,12b is consi- dered D, and this not because of the formula Vf! Dl "HDl, but rather because of its resemblance to Exod 32, 10(D) and Deut 9,14, where the verb nttW is used ("I will make of you a great nation"). In sum, Colenso's emphasis on vocabulary as the main argument for considering verses as Deuteronomistic is very often precarious. Never- theless, a comparison with analyses of more recent scholars aiming at discovering (post-) Deuteronomistic pecularities within Genesis- Numbers, or even within the rest of the Old (and New!) Testament, makes it apparent that Colenso's way of (defective) argumentation has not yet disappeared. 3. The Deuteronomist as editor It has already been noticed that, for Colenso, the D-passages in Genesis-Numbers stem from a Deuteronomistic editor, who edited and supplemented the existing Tetrateuch. Although Colenso does not explicitly deal with the peculiarities of this compiler, several of his cha- racteristics and techniques become clear from his analysis of the Deu- teronomistic passages, especially in the appendix of the seventh volume of The Pentateuch. The editorial activity of D can be summarized in five categories. However, the reader should be aware that with regard to the first (a) and the second (b) category, the Deuteronomisťs methodology seems to be very ambiguous. (a) On the one hand, D was concerned about the lack of internal consistency in the existing EJ story. For example, Gen 11,28-30 has been inserted by D to explain why Terach took with him his grandson Lot (v. 31) and not his son Haran112. Furthermore, in several instances, Colenso's Deuteronomist seems to be a very scrupulous editor. His use 112 The Pentateuch , Vol. 7, Appendix (n. 3), pp. 145-146; ii.</page><page sequence="25">396 HANS AUSLOOS of the literary technique of Wiederaufnahme in Gen 13,1-5, after his interpolation of Gen 12,9-20, thus recapitulating in Gen 13,1-5 the state of affairs from Gen 12,8 is illustrative of this modus operandi 113. In Exod 10,1-2, D harmonises the E J text with the rest of the so-called Plague narrative in Exod 7-11, since until Exod 10, each plague in the older story was introduced by a divine command114. Moreover, D's activity seems not to be restricted to some loose inser- tions in the text. On the contrary, he is making explicit reference to other D-passages on several points. For example, D's interpolation of □n-QN 7T3 rrn im -punan 3inn "uVü in Gen 26,1 makes reference to his previous, similar interpolation in Gen 12,10. (b) On the other hand, the Deuteronomist often seems to destroy a harmonious and logical text by loose interpolations, which, moreover, are often put in the wrong place. Here too we confine ourselves to offe- ring a few examples. In Exod 3,4a, the tetragram "suggests interpola- tion", while v. 4b reads With regard to Exod 4,15b (IFTD D171 11U7Í7H "IU7N nK DDflK TTTim), it is said that this "expansion by D", "inter- rupts the context"115. And Num 25,4 (D) - YaHWeH commands that "all the chiefs of the people must be impaled" - is considered "superfluous and contradicts vS' where "Moses summons Israel's judges to kill only the guilty Israelites"116. (c) As to the content, Colenso is convinced that the Deuteronomist showed compassion with widows, orphans and strangers, as is clear from his insertions in Exod 22,2 1-22117. Then, in his additions to Exod 33,1-6.12-23, D seems to react against the anthropomorphic presenta- tion of EJ, "YHWH descended in the cloud and stood there with Moses" (Exod 34, 5)118. Similarly, in Exod 33,lb.2-6.12-23, D "wishes to correct the anthropomorphic statement of the older writer in XXXIV.5a, that 'Jahveh came-down in the cloud and stood there with Moses'"119. Also on theological grounds, D fulminates in Gen 34 against intermarriage, which, according to EJ, becomes legitimate on condition of the circum- cision of the foreign partner120. 113 The Pentateuch , Vol. 7, Appendix (n. 3), p. 147. 114 The Pentateuch , Vol. 7, Appendix (n. 3), p. 155 (making reference to Wellhausen). 115 The Pentateuch , Vol. 7, Appendix (n. 3), p. 154. 116 The Pentateuch , Vol. 7, Appendix (n. 3), p. 154. 117 The Pentateuch , Vol. 7, Appendix (n. 3), p. 160. 118 The Pentateuch , Vol. 7, Appendix (n. 3), p. 160. 119 The Pentateuch , Vol. 7, Appendix (n. 3), p. 160. 120 The Pentateuch , Vol. 7, Appendix (n. 3), p. 150.</page><page sequence="26">J.W. COLENSO AND THE DEUTERONOMIST 397 (d) According to bishop Colenso, a strong antiquarian interest is peculiar to D as well. Whereas, for example, in the fourth volume of The Pentateuch , the entire pericope on the sons of God and the daughters of humans (Gen 6,1-8) is characterised 'Jehovistic'121, in the next volumes, Gen 6,4 is considered to be a later interpolation by the Deu- teronomist, because it is a typical exponent of D's antiquarian research into the early history of the inhabitants of Canaan, which is present in the book of Deuteronomy too (cf. Deut 2,10-12.20-21.23)122. Similarly, this antiquarian tendency can be found, among others, in Num 13,22b123. (e) Finally, in several instances, D introduces explanatory notes within the basic narrative he is editing. In this respect, geographical names are often supplemented by the names that had become common use in the time in which the Deuteronomistic editor was working. For example the explanatory notes in Gen 14,2.3.7.8.17 are attributed by Colenso to the D-editor. At a time when the exact meaning of old place names and their precise location were almost forgotten, a later hand inserted their latter-day equivalents. Because many of these ancient names are mentioned by the Deuteronomist in Deut 2-3, Colenso conjectures that these explanatory notes in Gen 14 and the rest of the Tetrateuch are from his hand as well. Postscript Against the background of the still ongoing quest for one or more Deuteronomistic or post-Deuteronomistic redaction (s) or Fortschrei- bungen within the process of the composition of the Pentateuch (and the rest of the Bible), the present article has aimed at focusing on one of the founders of this scientific concern, even if he has almost been neglected during the last century. Of course, his arguments in favour of the Deu- teronomisťs activity are not entirely solid and his theory on the origins and the composition of the Pentateuch is no longer workable. However, although "his work died with him"124, Colenso's name will for always be linked to the enigma of a Deuteronomistic redaction of the Pentateuch. 121 The Pentateuch , Vol. 4 (n. 3), pp. 29-30; 48. 122 The Pentateuch , Vol. 5 (n. 3), pp. 54 ; 183; CA (n. 3), pp. 2; 17-20; The Pentateuch , Vol. 6 (n. 3), Appendix (n. 3), p. 2; The PentateucĶ Vol. 7, Appendix (n. 3), p. ii. 123 The PentateucĶ Vol. 7, Appendix (n. 3), p. 164. 124 Le ROUX, A Story of Two Ways (n. 1), p. 106.</page></plain_text>
