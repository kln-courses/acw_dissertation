<plain_text><page sequence="1">W. von Sodkn, Herrscher im alten Orient (- Verständliche Wissen- schaft , TIV). Berlin-Göttingen-Heidelberg 1954. Springer- Verlag. In- 16°, 152 pp., 42 fig. This attractive and well-illustrated little book aims at portraying the personalities of rulers in ancient Mesopotamia, from Urukagina to Nabonidus. The task is difficult because Mesopotamian annals and li- terary texts reflect personality inadequately. Indeed, epistolary tablets such as the Mari letters may depict character better than other sources. The age of Mari and of Hammurapi is so well documented with letters and other texts that Professor von Soden is especially successful in por- traying Shamshi-Adad I, Zimrilim and Hammurapl. The author has fulfilled the aim of this book as well as anyone could. Moreover, he has accomplished a worthwhile service of another sort: The book is an excellent popular sketch of Mesopotamian cultural history that can not only initiate the layman, but also serve the student of As- syriology as a « refresher course » on Mesopotamian civilization and history. The following are notes on details : 1 . The spelling « Hammurabi » with b (p. 45 etc.) should be given up. The name has a p, as shown by the alphabetic spelling 'mrpi for Hammurapi of Ugarit. The name ends in consonantal aleph, and is to be normalized fammu-rapi' - 2. To call the West Semitic dynasties of Mesopotamia (such as Babylon I, Mari, etc.) « kanaanäisch » (pp. 45, 67) is to strip the term « Canaanite » of any precise meaning. For example, a West Semitic name like Yašmah- Adad cannot be Canaanite in the sense that Hebrew is Canaanite. He- brew (and for that matter Ugaritic and Aramaic) reflect Barth's Taw, whereby « yišmah » with i is called for. « Yašmah » goes with Arabic against Hebrew, Ugaritic and Aramaic. Accordingly, if the so-called Amorite names diverge from Bast Semitic (= Akkadian) and go with Arabic, with Aramaic, with Ugaritic, with Hebrew, or with any combina- tion of these West Semitic languages, it is more exact to call the linguistic origin of such names not Canaanite but West Semitic. - 3. P. 66: There is probably no connection between Subartu and Syria. If Ugaritic tbr refers to the Subareans, while šryn designates Syria/Antilebanon, the two terms would have to be separated on phonetic grounds. - 4. P. 68: It is quite likely that « Chanigalbat » should be changed to Hali- galbat. In the Nuzu tablets, the name is written ha-NI-gal-bat and</page><page sequence="2">Recensiones 181 ha-ŠI-gal-bat. The two spellings can be equated only if we read NI as li, and ŠI as lïè Cf. Orientalia 21 1952, 378. - 5. P. 73 (fig. 15): Tukulti- Ninurta I (1235-1198) is shown kneeling before the symbol of the god Nusku. The worship of symbols instead of anthropomorphic idols precisely at the traditional date of Moses, is not without interest. The ban against idols in the Decalogue may be the logical conclusion of a wide-spread trend (1). - 6. P. 108: The Hebrew account of Rabshakeh is of special interest to the Assyriologist because it gives a remarkable insight into Assyrian military intelligence such as the Assyrian annals never do. Rabshakeh is fluent not only in the lingua franca (Aramaic) but also in Judean Hebrew. He knows about the internal problems of the Judean nation and tries to make the most of the rift between the capital and the provincial cities. He is trained in the art of psycholo- gical warfare (2). One item is particularly suggestive: Successful mi- litary policy requires timing the attack at the enemy's weakest moment. The weakest moment for Judah was the eve of the 49th year of the Ju- bilee Cycle, for during that year and the following one (3), agricultural activity was outlawed on religious grounds. Isaiah (37:30) put his full weight behind the institution in spite of Sennacherib's invasion of 701. The historic authenticity of the institution in preexilic antiquity is re- flected by the existence of distinctive words for edible vegetation that grows of its own (i) during a sabbatical year ("¡'"B) such as the 49th of the Jubilee cycle (2 Kings 19:29; Is. 37:30), and (ii) during the following year (P'nD in 2 Kings 19:29; var. D'nr in Is. 37:30). It might con- ceivably be a coincidence that Sennacherib struck at Judah at precisely the best moment in half a century; but the high order of military intel- ligence reflected in Rabshakeh's speech makes it more likely that the timing was calculated. - 7. P. 115: There is a reason why the animals are so much better than the human figure on Assyrian reliefs. The human figure was a stereotyped theme inherited from the remote past; whereas the dying lioness or the sow followed by her shoats through the reeds were innovations where the artist was free to express his ori- ginality based on personal observation. Hopewell, N. J. Cyrus H. Gordon. (x) Actually, certain cults may be aniconic among polytheistic idol- aters. For instance, Re was not represented by an idol in his Old King- dom temples; and in Mesopotamia, Anu idols are conspicuous by their absence. (3) See my Introduction to Old Testament Times , Ventnor, 1953, pp. 229-230. (3) The Book of Jubilees is probably right in taking 49 as the total number of years in the Jubilee cycle. The 50th or Jubilee Year would then be identical with the first year of the new cycle. It is interesting to note that 1952 was celebrated as a sabbatical year in Israel. If we add 701 (the date of Sennacherib's invasion) to 1952, the total is 2653: a multiple of 7 (7 x 379 = 2653). If the modern tradition has come down authentically from antiquity, it confirms the date of Sennacherib's invasion.</page></plain_text>
