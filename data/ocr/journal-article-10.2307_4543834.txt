<plain_text><page sequence="1">27 II.-THE NATURE OF WILLING. By G. DAWES HICKS. "C FROM its first dawn to its highest actual achievement, we find," says William James, " that the cognitive faculty, where it appears to exist at all, appears but as one element in an organic mental whole, and as a minister to higher mental powers-the powers of will. Such a thing as its emanlcipation and absolution from these organic relations receives no faintest colour of plausibility from any fact we can discern." And again, " The willing department of our nature dominates both the conceiving department and the feeling department, or, in plainer English, perception and thinking are only there for behaviouir's sake." The account which Bergson lhas to offer of the nature of intellectual apprehensioni is very similar. Our ilntellect, he argues, has beein cast in the mould of action. " In order to act, we begin by proposing an end; we make a plan, then we go oni to the detail of the mechanisnm which will bring it to pass." These two writers reach, however, very different conclusions respecting, the character of the knowledcge obtained by the intellect as thus conceived. Just because, in his view, the function of intellect is not theoretical insight but action, just because intelligence, in its natural state, aims at a practically useful enld, Bergson holds it to be disqualified as an instrument for the acquisition of philosophical truth. The living reality escapes its ken. From mobility itself the intellect turns aside, since it has nothing to gain in dealing with it. It starts always from immobility, as though this were the ultimate reality, and, when it tries to form an idea of movement, it does so by constructing movement out of immobilities put together. Fashioned for the needs of action, intelligence looks upon reality as though it were carvable at will, and makes us</page><page sequence="2">28 G. DAWES HICKS. consider every actual form of things, even the form of natural things, in an artificial manner. And thus in the field of speculation it leads to deadlocks and gratuitously creates insoluble problems. According to James, on the other hand, it is only to the extent in which the intellect seeks to lay aside its essentially practical character that it becomes smitten with incapacity and degenerates into a merle log,ical machine inadequate to grasp the rich and varied content of real being. So far from pointing to a defect, its subordination to practice constitutes rather precisely its strength as an instrunment for the pursuit of truth. Truth in our ideas and beliefs means that " ideas (whiclh themiselves are but parts of our experience) become true just in so far as they help us to get into satis- factory relations with other parts of our experience." Experience, in short, is never ours simply as it comes to us. What is merely " given " is conistantly transformed by our deeds. " The conceiving faculty functions exclusively for the sake of ends that do not exist at all in the world of impressions we receive by way of our senses, btit are set by our emotional and practical subjectivity altogether. It is a transformer of the world of our impressions into a totally different world-the world of our conception; and the transformation is effected in the interests of our volitional nature, and for no other purpose whatsoever." Maan does not imerely find, he always co-operates in creating his world, and, since the given order lends itself to his remodelling, since it shows itself plastic to his practical purposes, the circumstance that thought exists for the sake of doing in no way detracts from the efficiency of thought as a means of knowledge. The real world is the world which is thus in the process of making, partly through human agency, and our power of volitional response to the nature of things is ipsofacto a reliable and trustworthy organ of communication with them. What, then, verinfes a belief according, to James falsifies that belief according, to Bergson. That two contradictory estimates of the worth of conceptual</page><page sequence="3">THE NATURE OF WILLING. 29 knowledge should be arrived at from what are virtually the same premisses, that the assumed essentially practical character of intellectual apprehension should be represented as vitiating it in the one case and qualifying it in the other for interpreting the nature of reality, a reality which in both cases is held to be fluent and changing rather than fixed and static, is in itself an interesting fact and may suggest various reflexions. At any rate, it affords, perhaps, sufficient justification for going back upon those premisses and inquiring, inlto the grounds on which they rest. It appears to me that much of what has recently been written with the object of showing the intimate conilexion of truth and practice leaves upon the reader the impression of "hanging in the air" for want of a pre- liminary analysis of what is involved in volition and of what actually takes place in voluntary activity. Instead of that, we meet only with vague, ambiguous, and slippery phrases such as " personal striving," " the self as a force," " the volitional theory of causation," " the thinking activity, as guided by purpose and will," and the like,* from which we can do no more than con- jecture the kind of conception that lies at the basis of what. is being urged. I wish, then, in this paper to call attention, to certain fundamental considerations in the psychology of volition that have important bearing upon the positions, to, which I have referred, of James and Bergson. The inquiry I propose to undertake is beset throughout with difficulties. At the beginning we are confronted with the extremely uncertain and wavering connotation of the term * In this connexion, it may perhaps be permissible to register a protest against the debasing of the philosophical currency by the coinage of misleading and really meaningless epithets like " intellectualism " and " voluntarism." An intellectualist, says Mr. Russell, " is any one who is- not a pragmatist," and that, I suppose, is what it comes to. A study which almost more than any other requires for its profitable pursuit an exact and a precise terminology is in danger of being flooded with a number of loose and barbarous names, that exemplify the violation of every canon, which ought to be observed in forming a scientific nomenclature.</page><page sequence="4">30 G. DAWES HICKS. "volition" or "voluntary activity." Even so ju(licious and careful a psychologist as Hdffdingy feels himself constrained to use this term in three quite distinct and different senses. He recognises as one type of willing that rationally controlled action in which there is selection of an end, and awareness on the part of the subject of his own activity as a means-a usage which undoubtedly comes nearest to the ordinary common-sense interpretation. But he also proposes to recoanise, as a simpler and more general type of willing, any exercise of activity that has for its antecedenit some mode of feeling or of presentation. Not only so. He insists upon likewise denoting by the term " will " an excessively simple and general funlction of the mental life as a whole-a function hard to describe, but corre- spondingr apparently to the diffused activity which is assumed to be the accompaniment of every change that is brought about in the mental life. Such change, the argument runs, always involves a certain reaction on the part of the subject. The nature of this reaction HOfding does not attempt to define more closely. But he is inclined to connect with it what is undoubtedly a very important feature of the life of mind, namely, the holding together of the different elements that are presented, at one and the same moment, in a single whole. The reaction, he seems to say, is of the nature of an act of synthesis, or conmbination. Now, from this instance, I think it would be fair to draw the general conclusion that to extend the denotation of the term " will" is likely to introduce confusion, and to obscure the real issue that has got to be faced. Willing, in the ordinary sense of the term, is obviously an exceedingly complex mental process, involving elements which by no possibility can be regarded as among the elementary facts of mind. It may quite well be the case that amongst these factors there is one that is specific and unique and requir- ing, separate recognition, but to that factor, if it exists at all, it would be inappropriate and misleading to apply the title " willing."</page><page sequence="5">THE NATURE OF WILLING. 31 With respect to the wider term " conation" mllost psycholo- gists will, I imagine, agree that the deviating and uncertain significance it bears in cturrent psychological literature is unfortunate and distracting. Mr. Bradley, for instance, would restrict the use of the term to states of mind of a comparatively advanced and developed type. The essential features of conation are, he contends, "the aspect of a ' not-myself ' and of a 'myself ' hindered by this, together with an idea of a change containing the removal of the hindrance, an idea with which the ' myself' feels itself one." And, he insists, all these aspects must be experienced together and must be felt as one whole. In other words, Mr. Bradley is of opinion that an idea of an end is essential to conation. He explains, it is true, that he does not mean that an " idea" must necessarily be a definite image existing separate, or at least separable, from the object. It would, accordinig to his view, suffice that a perceived existence should be qualified in a way incomnpatible with itself, whilst yet it cannot simply accept this new qualification and so cease to exist as at first perceived.* No one, of course, would deny the important difference between a state of minid where the idea of a "to be" is preseilt and another state of mind where no such idea is to be found. What, however, is questionable is the advisability of fixing upon this difference as though it constituted a break in the development of mind when, as a matter of fact, the vital thing psychologically is to lay stress upon the continuity of the former state with the latter. Mr. Bradley requests those who think that this differ- ence is not essential to conation to furnish the name of that state to which it really is essential. I should reply that he has himself shown us how to meet such a demand. So far as I can discover, he employs the term " desire " as virtually synonymous with " conation" according to the above definition of it, and I can see no advantage in retaining the two names for the same * Mind, N.S., X, 1901, p. 437 sNq.</page><page sequence="6">32 G. DAWES HICKS. thing. Now, we want the term "conation " as a collective heading for the group of mental processes roughly classified as impulses, appetites, wants, inclinations, wishes, desires, and volitions, and its consistent employment in this broad sense would be distinctly helpful in psychological work. At the same time, I fully admit the assignment to " conation " of so extensive a denotation has its dangers. It is apt to suggest a special view of the nature of the processes which are thus grouped together. When, for example, conationl is defined as " the theoretical active element of consciousness, showing itself in tendencies, impulses, desires) and acts of volition,"* it is difficult to colnceive how the phrase " theoretical active element" could be explained without pre-supposing a highly debateable interpretation of the factor which is taken to differentiate conative from other mental states. Whether there is any one distinguishing characteristic of all states that would thus be described as conative, and, if so, what it is, is, no doubt, a question of a particularly hard and unyielding kind. But, certainly, it would be harder still to find a sense of the term " active " in which it could be fairly said to indicate that feature. If conation gives " a suggestion of activity and nothing but activity,"t then its inappropriateness for supplying the want I have mentioned must be conceded. But I do not know why it should be supposed necessarily to carry that suggestion. Surely, it is possible to recognise that certaill phases of mind stand genetically in close relation to one another, and hence are legitimately grouped together as conative, without assuming that there must needs be an unique conation-element which by analysis can be detected in all of them, and which forms the bond of union between them. I am not, at present, arguing against the assumption; I think it not improbable that in the varied mental conditions referred to, there may be a commnon * Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology, Vol. 1, p. 206. t Croom Robertson, Elements of Psychology, p. 220.</page><page sequence="7">THE NATURE OF WILLING. 33 element, although to single it out for accurate description is certainly more than psychologists are yet in a position to do. I am pleading here, however, for keepingc the term conation free from any implicationi that would prevent its employmiient by those who are not pledged to a particular theory.* I. A curious circumnstanice is noticeable with respect to inuch recent argument bearing on the relation between knowledge and practice. Many of those who are at present insisting most strenuously upon the primacy, in the life of conscious- ness, of volition, and who regard the other functions of mind as dependent upon it, seem to be pre-supposing a conception of the Will which was originally framed from the point of view of a complete disparateness between the cognitive and conative aspects of mind. The Cartesian tradition has lingered stub- bornly and persistently even in quarters where one would least expect to find it. Descartes, it need hardly be said, rested a considerable superstructure upon the distinction between ittellectus and voluntas. But it is only in the writings of Malebranche that a serious attempt is made to work out a theory of the Will according, to Cartesian principles. Proceeding on the lines laid down by Descartes, Malebranche describes matter as a simple substance, having for its essence extension, and mind as another simple substance, lhaving for its essence thought. Matter, or extendedness, evinces, so he conceives, two properties or capacities. On the one hand, it is capable of assumjing this or that figure, and on the other hand it is capable of being moved. Correspondingly, mind evinces two faculties or capacities. On the one hand, it is capable of receivinig this or that idea, and, on the other halnd, it is capable of being iinfluenced by inclinations or desires. A sort of parallelism, * In this paper I shall use the term in the wide selnse I have indicated. c</page><page sequence="8">8) 4 G. DAWES HICKS. that is to say, subsists between (a) Figure and Understanding (Understanding being conceived as the sumn of the mind's ideas), and (b) Motion and Will. As regards the first, just as the facility of matter for being shaped and figured is entirely passive, so also is the understanding, or the faculty of receiving, ideas and modifications, entirely passive. To say that the mind apprelhends an object and to say that the mind receives the idea which represents that object are two ways of saying the same thing. As regards the second, just as motion is niot the essenlce of matter but a property extraneously added to it, "so will is not the essence of mind but a contingent and secondary factor. There might have been matter without motion, and there mig,ht also have been mind without will. In that case, the differentiating principle both of the outer and of the inner world would have been wanting. There would have been no distinction among corporeal things, aind there would have been no diversity amonig miental beings. For motion is the principiurm individuationis of matter, whilst what alone gives a persoilal, subjective tinge or colouring to the faculty of understanding is volition or will. Yet this last con- sideration serves in no way to bridge the gulf between what is essential or fundainental and what is accidental or subsidiary. The contrast, as thus drawn, between understanding and will would seem then to be sufficiently radical and thoroughgoinc. Malebranche has, however, another doctrine in reserve by the aid of which he is enabled, in some imieasure, to bring the antithetical factors into conjunction. It is, he contenids, characteristic of understanding that there is involved in it, throughouit its various modes of expression, the idea of being- in-general, of being without limit or restriction. At the root of the perceptive experience of every particular object lies the idea of infinite being, often, it is true, vaguely apprehended, although in it and by it alone all particular existences are perceived. Similarly, and just as the ulnderstanding may be said to have one supreme object, being-in-general, so the will</page><page sequence="9">THE NATURE OF WILLING. 35 may be said to be the tendency of the soul towards one supreme end, good-in-general. On the side of the under- standing it is by the help of feeling or sentience that the mind recognises particular existences; on the side of practice, it is through the specific pleasures which are connected with the apprehension of partictular existences that there spring up movemrients or impulses towards particular goods. But will in general, the active faculty of mind, is the striving or effort of the soul towards goodness as such, or infiniite perfection, anid this movement, never ceasing,, necessarily keeps the mind in a continual state of agitation or unrest. Further, Malebranche retains the famniliar doctrine of Descartes, that the will is the faculty of judgment, as distinct fromii mere apprehension; it is the will which selects, chooses, decides, in respect to the material presented to it by the understanding, and henlce arises the possibility of error. But Malebranche sees, wvith much greater clearness than Descartes, that he is confronted with the perplexing problem of accounting, for the way in which this indeterminate tendency towards the good-in-general comes to be specialised. He does, however, no more than cut the knot by declaring the sole necessity to be that the understandinig should be supplied with ideas and conceptions; to choose a particular good, or to determline a particular notion we must know it.* In dealing with a highly controversial subject, there is an advantage in having the view, which stands in marked anti- thesis to the position one is trying to develop, definitely set forth in its most extreme form and the imlplications it involves unambiguously stated. I make no excuse, therefore, for the above brief account of an interpretation of volition which is fundamentally opposed to the interpretation I shall attempt here to justify. The latter will, I hope, become the clearer through the contrast it offers to the former. * Recherche de la Verite, i, 1 and 2; iii, Part i, 1 and 2; iii, Part ii, 8; iv, 1 and 2. c 2</page><page sequence="10">tO 6 G. DAWES HICKS. I had better lay down at once the nmain principle upon which I propose to proceed, and to which, in contradistinctioni to that lying at the basis of the theory I have summarised, all the relevant psyclhological facts seem to me to point. It may perhaps be expressed in some such terms as the following. There is in the inner life no unique, simple unanalysable com- ponent that caii fairly be indicated by a perfectly general phrase such as "I will." There is no process of willing-in-general. Whenever I will, I will something-something specific, concrete, particular. No one can in truth merely will, no one can will without willing a this or that. Willing as simply bare activity is a notion- of ouir abstractingy thought, one of the false and mischievous abstractions into which, by a strange fatality, those who protest most vehemently against the abstract procedure of formal logic are peculiarly liable to fall. Although, theni, we may legitimately enough employ the term "will " as we employ other general terms, to signify, namely, the features that are exemplified in concrete acts of willing, we are not entitled to speak of " the will " as though it were a permanent entity to be met with even at moments when there is no actual volition. Locke's remarks in this referenice still retain their force. " If," he wrote, " it be reason- able to suppose and talk of faculties as distinct beings that can act (as we do, when we say the will orders, and the will is free), it is fit that we should make a speaking faculty, and a walking faculty, and a dancing faculty, by which these actions are produced, which are but modes of motion; as well as we make the will and unlderstanding to be faculties, by which the actions of choosing and perceiving are produced, which are btit several modes of thinking. And we may as well properly say that it is the siniging faculty sings, and the dancing faculty dances, as that the will chooses, or that the understanding conceives; or, as is usual, that the will directs the understanding, or the under- standing obeys or obeys not the will: it being altogether as proper and intelligible to say that the power of speaking directs</page><page sequence="11">THE NATURtE OF WILLING. 37 the power of siniging, or the power of singing obeys or disobeys the power of speaking."* In short, as Aristotle expressed it (-De Ant. 433, b. 27), there can be no volition without definlite content; OpECKTLKOP 8 OVK avev jaVTacias. I must be allowed merely to assert this principle at present, and to refer to the rest of this paper for its justification. II. I pass now to the task of showing grounds for holding to be true a proposition which is constantly ignored in dis- cussions concerning the natuire of volition. Such phrases as "the will exciting the muscles to contract," "the will causing the movements of the body," are of frequent occurrence, and, metaphorical though they may be, they ofteni carry with them implications of a thoroughly crude and mischievous kind. The proposition I wish to emphasise may be expressed briefly thus:-Whatever be the relation between Dody and mind, the mechanism of bodily imovement is not worked by the conscious subject after the fashion in which an individual agent nmay set in motion or stop a machine, the parts of which lie before him at his disposal. There is nothing, so far as can be discovered, in the relation between the conscious subject and what are called his bodily miiovements comparable to the relation betweeni an operator and the movemiients of the parts of the mnechanical contrivance he may be directinig. The considerations to be advanced in support of this contention are not peculiar to the practical side of conscious experience. Mechanical and physiological ehanges, for the most part of an extremely complicated character, go along with all psychical changes, whether the latter be what are usually described as cognitive, or affective, or conative. But of these mnechanical and physiological changes there is no inimediate awareness on the part of the experiencing subject. They do * Essay, Book ii, chap. xxi, 17.</page><page sequence="12">38 G. DAWES HICKS. not form part of what in and through their instrumentality is cognised, or felt, or willed. Take, for example, the perception of lioht or colour. On the occasion of the perception of (say) a blue object, anl elaborate series of events has run its course in the apparatus that subserves the function of visual apprehenision. Ether waves have impinged upon the eye, come to a point withini the crystalline lens, produiced chemical changes in the cones of the retina, in virtue of which ani influence of some sort has been conveyed along the appropriate nerves and has set up a process (which is the in'mediate precursor of a mental state) in the occipital lobes of the cortex. Btut of all this the experiencing subject has no direct awareness. In and througlh the mental state which ensues he is conscious neither of the brain and its changes, nor of the optic nerve and the disturbance passinc along it, nor of the retina and its imare; he is conscious of an externial object, having, the mark or characteristic of blueness. And it is scarcely a hazardous conjecture that cognition of the object would be imuperilled were cognition of the complex details just mentioned to supervene. The situation is strictly similar with respect to the execution or the carrying out of voluntary actions. The conscious subject has no direct awareness of the position, size, or mode of contrac- tion of the muscles none either of the existence, function, or condition of the motor nerves; none of the way in which the motor nerves are connected with the muscles. Even the physiologist is at a loss to explain what precisely it is which the nerve-fibres are the means of transnmitting, whilst as to the relation between the mental state aild the innervating current he is completely in the dark. "However inanifest it inay appear to us," says Lotze, in what has always seemed to ine one of the greatest chapters of the fediciqische Psychologie, " that in nonie of our bodily activities are we consciously so thoroughly at home as in regard to our owni</page><page sequence="13">THE NATURE OF WILLING. -9 movements, however readily we may believe that we are self- acting, even down to the smallest details of such movements, yet in all this we are the victims of illusion, which it needs, but a little reflexion to dispel. Reflexion shows us tlhat, whilst we can will, we are not ourselves able to carry into effect; that, on the contrary, an arrangement of nature, wholly independent of our will, has, according to mechanical necessity. conjoined with our volitional and other nmental states certain changes of our body, in whichl must ensue, without our co- operation, movemernts of the lirnbs in specific amounlts and directions. We, for our part, have nothing, further to do than to produce in ourselves those psychical states which serve as. points of departure for the physical processes, and, according to laws aiid through means that entirely escape our con- sciousness, the physical processes unfold themselves in harmony with our ends."* If one has regard to the extensive network of intricate adjustmients that intervene between a resolution anid its extelrnial realisation, if one remembers that the niumber of differeint movements possible for each single limb, by means of a thousand minute modifications of combina- tion and direction, is indefinitely large, and for the whole body well-niglh incalculable, the importance of what I am urgring becomes manifest. In so ordinary a performance as liftinig the arm, or risinig fromi a chair, there has been involved a process of what perhaps may be called miiechaniical selection, of suich delicacy that, had each item to be devised by the conscious subject, it is probable that the latter would never attain to the experienice of carrying a resolve into effect at all. The conscious subject would, in other words, be foiled and baffled by the comiiplexity of a problem which is solved with extraordinary promiptitude by the miechianism of nature. So far, therefore, from being comparable to an operator, to wihom the various details of his apparatus are familiar, thle * Jfedicinische Psychologie, p. 288.</page><page sequence="14">40 G. DAWES HICKS. position of the coniscious subject might, so Lotze remarks, more appropriately be likened to that of a subordinate labourer, who to the working of the machine, the inner structure of which he has neither seen nor comprehends, contributes merely the external appliances necessary to set it going, or supplies the raw material, according to rules, the reason for which he has never understood, that now this and now that desired resuilt may be attained. Seeing, then, that for the realisatioli of a resolve or a purpose the conscious subject is at the nmercy of an extra- ordinarily intricate conjunction of factors lying beyond tlle range of his inner life, seeing that the mnechanism by means of which volition finds expression in tlhe external world is conm- pletely hidden from him, the conclusion seems forced upon us that what specifically characterises volition as a fact of mind must be, to a large extent, at least, independent of the execution whicb is normally its consequent. The scope of willing, tbe content of the inner state which we call an act of will, would doubtless be enormously affected if execution habitually happened in a way other than that in which, as a matter of fact, it does happen, but the peculiar characteristic of willing as a state of mind might still be the same as it is now. A further conclusioni, I think, also follows. If, looked at from the standpoint of the individual conscious subject, the relationl between willing and the mechanisnm of carrying, out what is willed be thus contingent and arbitrary, it is exceedingly improbable that in the primitive stages of conation there couldl have been in any way pre-figured or foreshadowed in a specific conative act the results which would ensue frorn that act. There could scarcely have been in any way ante- cedenitly represented in the rudimientary consciousness the bodily movements or the objective change or the experience in the form of motor and other presentations, which would supervene upon a state of im)pulse or striving. Anything, therefore, of the nature of an idea of end or purpose must,</page><page sequence="15">THE NATURE OF WILLING. 41 in that case, be absent from the early phases of the life of consciousness; and without giving to the idea of " end" what I cannot but regard as an illegitimate, and in the long run unintelligible, extension, I do lnot see how a con- trary contention can be sustained. Even in the mature mental life what is absolutely new and novel cannot be willed; the conscious subject can only deliberately will an act with the nature of which he is to some extent acquainted. It is no doubt true that almost all acts of will issue in consequences, some of which are unforeseen, and it may be altogether novel. Yet what is actually willed in such cases is something of which the subject has acquired previous knowledge. A mani with suiicidal intent m-ay, for example, will to do that which will bring, about his death, and of death he certainly has had no personal experience. But he is familiar with the actual details that make uip the content of his act of will (e.g., swallowing a dose, or pointing a pistol), and, were he not, the act of will would be for him inmpossible. The consequences of such an act are dcoubtless novel; that, however, which is directly willed is not. And, on this account alone, one is entitled, I think, to insist that willing, or volition, in any appropriate sense of the word, is a derivative or secondary mental product, and not an original or primary mode of psychical activity. The conclusion just reached may be supported on more specific and definite grounds. Psychologists would, I imagine, agree that the conditions inivolved in the early stages of voluntary activity are very largely movemenits of the body, or rather the experiences which are connected with movements of the body. Those experiences are of mrore than one kind. On the one hand, there are sense experiences connected with the initiation and execution of bodily movement, and, on the other hand, the executed movement itself becomes matter of apprehension, a fact of which the subject, in and through presentations of different kinds, becomies aware. Now, not until the experielnces which precede and accompany the</page><page sequence="16">42 G. DAW ES HICKS. execution of movement have been already connected witlh presentations-themiiselves far from sinmple-which have as their content executed movements, could there be formed in consciousness the total state, awareness of movement as execuited by the individual agent. Only through experience. so far as I can see, could the individual come to discriminate between occurrences that simnply happen and occulrrenlces that take place as conisequences of a representation of his own. Only through experienice could there possibly be formled in conisciousness the representation of that which would yield satisfaction to the subject. Only through experience could such a representation have becomiie welded together in con- sciousness with the specific bodily movements that secure its realisation. Both the control and the voluintary execution of movement depend, therefore, upon the establishment of emiipirical connexionis between certain phases of the inner life and certain modes of the bodily organism. It would appear, theni, that the enmergence of even the most elem:ientary kinds of consciously regulated action was preceded by a stage in which the distinctive peculiarity of purposive conduct would be wholly absent from the process of executinIg inovements. Before there could have been established any normal or ordinary correlation of the state (say) of desiring and the way of realising what is desired there must have preceded a long series of executed movements, inore or less chaotic and inchoate in character, and only gradtually would there have come about lines of definite connexion between states of the inner life and modes of bodily niovenment. Herein lies, I believe, the truth conicerning what irn Bain's analysis of volition is designated " spontaneous activity." The name is not, in.deed, happily chosen. What appears to be meant is that the bodily organism, or, more specially, the conijoined muscular and motor system, is to be regarded as the seat of activities not entirely dependent for their discharge on stimulation from without. Bain cites as instances the activity</page><page sequence="17">THE NATURE OF WILLING. 43 displayed by the inivoluintary muscles in the maintenance of respiration, the circulation of blood, etc., the initial movements of infancy, and the activity of young animals in general, the activity of excitement; the occurrence of temperanients of great activity with comparatively low senisibility. And he accounts for what he calls " spontaneity " by regarding it as the response of the oraanic system to nutritioni, as an effusion of energy of which the food is the conditiori. It is, I take it, iore than doubtful whether all or any of these activities can be said to be so independent of external stimuli as Bain supposed. According to the more recent theory of " tropism" no movements of animals are exclusively determiined by internal conditions, and the characteristic reactions of living org,anisrns to the influences of the envirouinrent, suclh as changes of temperature, light, colour, the t6uch of a solid object, imiay be described in terms of certain purely physical and chemical processes. The turning of a plaint to the light, the flying of a moth into the flame, or the running away of a centipede fromii it, are reactions typical of the responsiveniess of organic matter gyenerally, anid do not necessarily indicate the presence of mental factors. The question as to the exact nature of the physical or chemical conditions that are taken to determine organic reactions, we can here pass over. Througlh whatsoever causes, the whole organism in the case of most rudimenitary forms of life is excessively mobile, and the slightest change in the environment tends to result in bodily activity. And in the higher animals, the junctioni between the sensory and motor miiechanism is so close and intimate that hardly any stimulation of the one fails to find a response of some sort in the other. In truth, even the most elementary act, of sense-perception is niever in its real concrete character a mere act of cognitive apprehension, but a change, also, in the state of feeling and, as apparently resulting fronm both these circumstances, a certain muode of experienice that is the correlative of bodily movemenit. The total fact is, tlherefore, a very complex one, and the</page><page sequence="18">44 G. DAWES HICKS. complexity is certainly partially due to the depenidence of the process of senise-perception upon physiological conditionis. In insistinlg that voluntary action, in the strict sense, is dependent uipon a complicated bodily meelanism and pre- supposes genetically a long prior stage of mental development, I may appear to be runnincg counter to the view, for which Professor Ward has always contended, that the nmovements we call reflex or automatic were oriiginally accomipanied by con- sciousness. Anld as that view is sometiines stated it would, n10 doubt, be irreconicilable with what I have been urging. For instance, when it is said that "we are conmpelled by a sound method to regard sensori-motor actions as degraded or mechanical forms of voluntary actions, instead of regarding, voluntary actions as gradually differentiated ouit of somethinig physical," a fair rejoinder seems to be that these alternatives are not exhaustive. Sensori-motor actions may be occasioned by circumstances that have no counterpart in the inner life and be, indeed, necessary conditions for the appearance ot voluntary actions, without the latter having been differentiated out of them. Or, it may be that sensori-iinotor actions were originally accompainied by psychical factors, anid that the subsequent disappearance of the psychical accompaniments is capable of explanation sonmewhat after the analogy of that whiclh occurs in the case of our acquired dexterities. The quite general considerationi that the movements in question are exhibited only in the life of an animated organism,- only, that is to say, in a structure such as experience fairly entitles us to assert is capable of serving as thte basis for some phase of conscious being,-lends unquestion- able support to this last supposition. But the anialogy may be pressed much too far if it is taken to imply that volition, or something resembling it, was once, either in the experience of the individual or of his ancestors, the antecedent of actions which have gradually become automatic. Professor Ward himself takes it to be obvious that " the</page><page sequence="19">THE NATURE OF WILLING. 45 simplest definitely puiposive movement must have been pre- ceded by some mlovement simpler still " because " any distinct miiovement purposely made presupposes the ideal presentationi before the actual realisation of the movement." And since "such ideal presentation, being a re-presentation, equally pre- supposes a previous actual movemrlent of which it is the so- called mental residuum," he concludes that there is but one way left, namely, " to regard those movements which are immediately expressive of pleasure or pain as primordial, and to regard the so-called voluntary movements as elaborated out of these."* The considerations uipon which Dr. Ward here lays stress are, it seems to me, fundamenital, anid they point, surely, to the conclusion that the consciousness which may have accompanied the antecedents of the actions we call automiatic or reflex mnust, in any case, have been so crude and rudimentary as to preclude anything, of the natuire to which the epithet "voluntary" could fairly be applied. Moreover, as Lotze pointed out, the apparently purposive character of reflexes may easily be exaggerated. No doubt the movement of a decapi- tated frog that brings its foot to the place on the skin which is touched possesses a certain "purposiveness," but it is not purposiveness of the kind which one would attribute to the mental life. The undamnaged animal would rather have sought safety in flight, and have tried thus to escape from the danger indicated by the stimulation. So far as the other modes of corporeal movement, whichb together with the variety called reflex, inay be said to form the natural basis necessary for the development of rationally regulated action, are concerned, the presence of psychical factors, can scarcely be disputed, but still they yield no evidence of having had as their antecedents ideal representations of the changes to which they give rise. For instance, in imitative movements, and in movements expressive of emotions, what * Encyclope3dia Britanwica, XIth Ed., vol. xxii, p. 553.</page><page sequence="20">46 G. DAWES HICKS. happens is not, so far as can be detected, the outcome of any contemplated end or purpose, nor does it lie, to any considerable extent, within the power of the conscious subject to control such movements. Th-. conscious subject can give no reason why laughing should be conjoined with pleasure and crying with pain rather than the reverse, nor can he without difficulty restrain involuntary yawns and sighs. Here, agcain, the general principle is exemplified that every change in conscious experience, particularly cbange in sense experience, has as concomitants, On1 the one hand, a phase of feeling, and oni the other hanid, bodily inovement, and this general principle throws, in itself, a good deal of light upon the mrlovements referred to. Finally, habitual actions-aptly described by Hartley as "secondarily automatic "-illustrate once miore how delicately balanced an instrument stands at the disposal of the suNbject when lhe reaches the stag,e of deliberately choosingy and resolving. In the huiman aaent, the series of movements nmaking up the complete action in these cases usually at one time followed fromn a series of distinct volitions, but they have come to supervene so readily and immediately upon some psychical state that the iildividual refers them in no definite way to himself as the agent. By the constant establishment of links of connexion between presenitations or representations, feelings and a train of bodily movemenits, it has become possible for a single presentation or representation to fulfil the function of a liberator of tlhe activities requisite for the execution of the movements in question. As Jamiies puts it, the subject is aware of nothing between the idea and the execution. He pictures the act and it is done, and that is the whole story which introspection has to tell us. And Jaines points out that this, instead of being a curiosity of our mental life, is in truth the normal process. Habitual actions exhibit, that is to say, in complicated fashion, what takes place throughout the development of the facility, on the part of the individual, of reguilating and controllin, his movements. To this consideration I slhall return later.</page><page sequence="21">TILE NATURE OF WILLING. 47 III. The term " will," I have been insisting, indicates no separate or unique faculty or power of mind to which the varied manifestations of voluntary activity are to be assigned. It stands rather for a process of a highly complex and complicated character,-a process the nature and colnditions of which it is impossible to determine without taking into account the multiplicity of simpler mental factors that enter into and are involved in it. These simpler factors have all had their history, and it is only, it seems to me, from the genetic point of view that the psychologist can hope to deal successfully with the problems that here confront him. I have referred in the preceding section to certain modes of activity that imiay reasonably be regarded as having prepared the way for the appearance of volition in the strict sense, but I have referred to them mainly in objective fashion, as they present themselves, namiely, to an external observer. I wish now to look at willing, as it occurs in the mature mental life, and to look at it rather from the inner than from the outer side,-from the standpoint, that is to say, of the experiencing subject. I slhall try to distinguish the components which analysis seems to show are essential to an act of will, and in the absence of any of which we should be entitled to say we have not got will in the legitimate sense of that word. In an extremely interesting and methodical article Mr. Shand has endeavoured to differentiate a plurality of types of will,* and maintains that a study of these types is an indispensable basis to a scientific theory of volition. In addition to the miore ordinarily recognised types, will, he finds, may be negative, or imperative, or hypothetical, or disjunctive, and the more these typical forms are studied, the more, he thinks, will the difficulty be appreciated of embracing them in any one suprenme type. * Jind, N.S., vi, 1897, p. 289 sqq.</page><page sequence="22">48 G. DAWES HICKS. I do not know whether Mr. Shand wishes to suggest that each of these types is in the end " irreducible and ultimate," or that they will not conform to any general account of the will which may be given. It is true that in a previous article,* he had contended that will itself has a unique quality which cannot be analysed into others, or constituted out of them, that it is as much a specific differentiation of conation as the various class- sensations are specific differentiations of a common sensibility. And I suppose, by similarity of reasoning, it might be urged that each of the different types just mentioned is a specific differentia- tion of will, having, a distinctive quality incapable of further analysis or description. In this sense, however, it might be said, it seems to me, not only that every kind of mental process, but that each particular miental process, is unique ancl ultimate. For, as an actual fact of mind, every mental process is a unified whole, wllich cannot be reconstituted by combina- tion of its elements. But uniqueness of this sort militates in no way against the possibility of psychological analysis, nor does it necessarily point to a simple component, ultinmate and specific in character, the like of which is to be met in no other state of the mental life. So far as I can see, the mnain differ- ence between the various types of will singled out by Mr. Shand lies in the diversity of what is willed in the several cases, and no more interferes with the attempt to determine the charac- teristic features of willing than the varying contents of (say) visual apprehension interfere with the attempt to determine the characteristic features of that process. What, I think, does render the undertaking, in question difficult is the fact that willing is a continually altering, a continually developing. state or attitude of the conscious subject, which in the course of mental history passes through a great variety of stages, beginning with the relatively indeterminate and indefinite and advancing to what is relatively determinate and definite. One * Mind, N.S., iv, 1895, p. 450 sqq.</page><page sequence="23">THE NATURE OF AW,ILLING. 49 can but select a particular stage and qualify what one has to say about the factors that result from the analysis by reference to the less and the miiore advanced stages one takes to be involved in the history of the whole process. I proceed, then, to note the principal constituents whichl psychological analysis enables us, I believe, to detect in an act of will. (a) In the first place, there is involved distinct recog- niition on the part of the suibject willinig of himself. Only in so far as the coniscious subject is capable of being aware of self, not miierely as the abstract centre of ieference for all that forms part of his experience, but as a concrete individual personality, are we justified in speaking of hiiim as a voluntary agent. The fact of willing can onily be formulated by means of the expression " I will." I do not mean that the momentary consciousness of himself as the agent in respect to the action to be performed is an essenltial ingredient in every act that is to be called voluntary. But as Kant said of the " I think " in referelnce to presentations, so we can say of the " I will "-it must, in so far as I am acting voluntarily, " alle meine Bestirn- mungen begleiten k6nnen." Consciousness of self has by no means the same contents in all stages of its development. In its crudest form, it is largely made uip of what it niever entirely loses-the mass of Tague presentations arid feelings coninected with the vital processes of the body. But at the stage with which we are now coincerned, it carries with it reflective separa- tion of self fronm the relatively independent not-self, and the possibility of assimilating (or " identifying," as is usually said&gt; a specific line of coniduct with the idea of self. This phrase "idea of self " is, it is true, woefully ambiguous, and it is easy to raise difficulties as to what exactly is to be understood by the so-called "identification with self." Such difficulties will be insurmountable so long as two fundamental considerations are ignored. On the one hand, we are not justified in speaking of desires, motives, impulses, etc., as though they were isolated enitities, standing over against the subject as so maniy matters D</page><page sequence="24">00 G. DAWES HICKS. of experience. They are, in truth, themselves ways through which the self-consciousness of the individual develops, and since the self can never, in truth, be severed from-l these, its miodes of expression, the union between the two cannot be of the nature of mere mechanical juxtaposition. On the other hand, in self-consciousness there is always involved a division of the total self. When I contemplate myself, the I and wmiyself are never identical.* The former, which is an element in all our experience, is never an object of experience, and we mlay proceed in an endless series of attempts to inspect, as an object, the act of relating the end in view with the idea of the self. We may make of this a problem if we please, but we have no grounid for discerning in the said act any unique or distinctive quality, or for giving to it alone the name of volition. The outcome of such act of relating is, as Professor Stout says, definite enough. "When I judge that in so far as in me lies I shall realise a certain end, the endeavour to realise that eind becomes ipso facto an integral part of the idea of miiyself. Failure to realise it is regarded as my failure, my defeat." t (b) In the second place, there is to be detected in the fact of Willing, and as a necessary component, the presence of representations or ideas, together with the recognition of the immediate momentary reality with which these representations or ideas stand in contrast. As Mr. Bradley is wont to state it, we have an existing niot-self, together with the idea of its change. The not-self comes before me, first of all, as a perceived object, which is independently, which is other than the experiencing self. So miuch is common to the theoretical anid practical attitudes of m-lind. But in the latter attitude there is adcled a further feature. The perceived not-self appears * Compare Mr. Bradley's distinction between the felt self which is so far never an object, and the felt self, so far as it becomes an object (e.g., Mfind, N.S., xii, 1903, p. 161). t 2 find, N.S., v, 1896, p. 358.</page><page sequence="25">THE NATURE OF WILLING. 51 not only as aii other, but as an opposite. I am aware of myself as something contrary to the object, and as struggling to change it. I am aware of myself as one with the idea or representation in a sense in which I am not one with the object which opposes it, and accordingly in and through this idea or representation I am conscious of myself as in collision with that object, and the latter has thus become alien to me in a manner in which it was ilot alien in the mere act of perceiving. In view of Professor Alexander's recent article,* it is worth while perhaps to press this point. Whereas in the purely cocgnitive attitude the existent object serves or may serve to expand and enrich the self, in the conative attitude it tends rather to thwart and hinder the self. And in view of the claimn to regard volition as a primordial attitude of mind, iu is worth while insisting upon the consideration that unless the primnitive subject is to be supposed already capable of appre- ciating the difference between ideas or representations of its own and the reality of what is imimediately apprehended, the claim in question calls for unqualified rejection. (c) In the third place, it is to be noted that the ideas or representations just referred to involve as part of their content change or alteration of that which is the immiiediately appre- heended reality,-a change or alteration to be brought about by the subject himself. Or, ag,ain using Mr. Bradley's terminology, I am aware of the not-self as something to be changed, and in willinog, therefore, I must represent to myself in idea the change which I conceive myself capable of realising. In other words, in however vague and ill-definecd a form, I possess the notion of an end, the idea of a " to be," of that towards which the change or alteration I am contemplating is to be directed. I conceive of the change or alteration as a way by which the representations I form of a possible state of things will attain the fullness, the vividness, the completeness of real existence. * British Journal of Psychology, iv, p. 239. D 2</page><page sequence="26">52 9G. DAWES HICKS. (d) In the fourth place, there is involved in the state of willing, and as an indispensable concomitant, the element of affective tone or feeling. It is to be noted that the elemenlt of feeling makes its appearance here in more forms than one. On the one hand, associated with the apprehension of the actually present existing not-self, wnich is hindering or impeding the self, will be a feeling more or less unpleasant or painful in character. On the other hand, the representation of the end is the representation of that which would yield satisfaction to the self, and since the representation of what is pleasurable has always a pleasurable tone, there will be in the state we are considering a foretaste, so to speak, in a weaker form, of the pleasure of realisation. The presence together of these two incompatible modes of feeling-tone partly accounts, I take it, for that experience of tension or uneasiness that characterises the process in the preliminary part of its course. (e) In the fifth place, we may distinguish in the total state what meanwhile I will describe by the vague term, con- sciousness or experience of activity exercised by the subject, the element which raises the whole state to that which it is customary to denote as one of active tendency. For the present, I simply note the presence of this factor, and the fact that in the mature mind it manifests itself in a great variety of degrees. It can scarcely be questioned that our ordinary consciousness of activity is the result of repeated experiences, and' that it has acquired a definiteness and appearance of simplicity which may conceal from us its true character. So far, I have been enumerating factors which are common to will and other conative complexes, especially the state of desiring. The total state of desiring contains not only the representation of an end, but likewise what may be described as the adoption of that end by the desiring subject as capable of satisfying him. But in willing there is further involved a decision that the realisation of such end is possible</page><page sequence="27">THE NATURE OF WILLING. 53 on the part of the subject. The subject is in the position of giving practical effect to his state of mind. What Aristotle called deliberation (3o6Xevo-ts') and choice (7poatpeov-) are clearly to be found in bot:h states of mind, and have in fact been implied in the factors already specified. It is true Aristotle confined /3OVxeVlS~ to a consideration of means. "Having," he says, " sonme particular end iu view, we consider by what means this end can be attained." But obviously a critical comparison and weighing of circumstances is as familiar in regard to ends as in regard to means, although no doubt it is prorninently exempli- fied wheni the problemn is as to the possibility of bringing into connexion with self-consciousness the impulses and ideas on the occasion of which action is mechanically brought about. And 7rpoadpeolv is virtually synonymlous with what has been (lescribed as the identification of an idea with the self. (f) In willing there is doubtless to be found ani element which is not present in desire. There is unquestionably a distinction, and an important distinction, between the bare representation of a certain series of changes as capable of being produced by the activity of the conscious subject and the determination to realise these changes. I believe, however, it is an error to make use of an apparently simple but in truth highly ambiguous term, such as resolution, to indicate the grouind of that distinction. Lotze, for example, tries to constitute an absolute difference between what is indicated by the phrase " I will" and all other states of the mental life. " We have to do with an act of will," he says, " only when the impulses tending to action being clearly apprehended, the decision whether they shall be followed out or not remains over, anid is left, not to the constraining force of these irripelling motives, but to the mind that is independent of them."* The will, he urges, does nothing but will; all possible content of volition is supplied through the involuntary train * iicrocosmos, Book II, ch. 5, s. 5.</page><page sequence="28">54 G. DAWES HICKS. of thoughts and feelings. It seems to me unpsychological thus to transform a perfectly intelligible distinction in the processes of the inner life into a breach of continuity and to postulate the separate existence of a unique inexplicable power coming up peq saltum from the depths of our being. That there is involved in will an ultimate fact-a fact which does not come before us after the manner of an occurrence in the inner life-seems to nme certainly true. But this f(act is not peculiar to willing. It is no other thanl the fact of self-con- sciousness, which, when a certain stage of development is reached, is involved nlo less in kniowing and in feeling than in volition, and which, in the words of Kant, enables a man to distinguish himself from all else in his experience. What, however, we are here concerned with is not that general fact, but a specific difference such as ought to be discover- able by psychological analysis. Professor Stout has, I think, correctly described this element as a certain kind of judgment or belief. " A v olition is a desire qualified and defined by the judgment that, so far as in us lies, we shall bring about the attainment of the desired end. Mere loniging may be defined in the floating idea of an end. Mere desire is defined in this idea tog,ether with the problematic judgrtlent that we may or may not attempt to realise it. A volition, on the other hand, is a desire defined in the judgment that we are going to realise an end, if possible."* Professor Stout guards himself against being takeni to mean that a volition is merely a judgment. According to his viLew it is the cognitive side of our nature which gives determinate character to the conative, and that conation which finds its cognitive definition in the judgment, "I shall attemipt to attain this or that," is a volition. But, whilst he does not discern any peculiar or inexplicable factor in a volition as distinguished from a desire, Professor Stout holds neverthe- * Mind, N.S., v, 1896, p. 356.</page><page sequence="29">THE NATURE OF WILLING. 55 less that a unique and unanalysable element is characteristic of conative complexes as distinguished from merely cogni- tive complexes. I need only recall his well-known contention that in every conative complex the element from whichl the whole derives its distinctively conative character is that which may be called "felt tendency."* This element, it is maintained, is immediately experienced in the same sense as pleasure or paini while they are beingO felt, and it does not admnit of further analysis. There are, it seems to me, difficulties inT Dr. Stout's view which here I can onily briefly inidicate. For one thing, I do not uniderstand why this particular ingredient in the complex shouild be spoken of as though it alonie were immediately experienced, when obviously, according to the theory, the wlhole complex is immediately experienced. Again, although it is adinitted that the element of " felt tendency" niever actuially appears in isolation at the level of conscious experience with which we are familiar, yet it does seem to be implied that as we descend the scale of mental existence, we should approximate towards such an isolation. And I cainnot but regard this supposition as contrary to what we hive every reason for sayingf has been the course of psychical evolution, -namely, that isolation, or differenitiation, of one kind of mental process from another is an outcome of the development of consciousness and not a characteristic of coIn- sciousness at the beginning. But the chief difficulty evinces itself when this theory is taken in conjunction with Dr. Stout's general view of the nature of the inner life. Conation anld cogni- tion, he has been in the habit of teachinig us. are but different aspects of oine and the same process. " Cognition gives the process its determinate character: without conation there would be nio process at all to lhave a character." In other words, all mental processes as processes are conative, and, accordingly, " felt tendency'" should be a distinctive characteristic of ever?y * B1ritish Journal of Psycholoqq, ii, 1906, p. 1 sqq.</page><page sequence="30">56 G. DAWES hIICKS. mental state. How, then, is it possible to fix upon it as furnishina a means of differentiating certain attitudes of mind fronm others ? This leads me to the factor in volition which was described in the analysis offered above as consciousness of activity exerted by the subject. Mental activity exists, Dr. Stout has argued, in being felt. "The stream of consciousness feels its owni current." I raise not now any question as to the legitimacy of the conception of mental process feeling itself. I press only the consideration that such immediate experience of mental process, even though it be admitted, will not enable us to account for the activity we are aware of in the attitude of willing. For cx hypothesi all mental processes are active-the process of perceiving, for example, no less than the process of desiring or resolving and there is so far, therefore, no reasoni why the stream of consciousness should feel its own currenit mlore pronouncedly in the one case than in the other. And, as has been more than once pointed out, D)r. Stout offers no explanation of the circumstance that we ever are conscious of ourselves as passive. In the two experiences which we describe as the " consciousniess of effort " and the " consciousness of ease," the content or object of which there is consciousness is different, but consciousness surely may be as active in the one case as in the other. In listening, to a symiiphony or ii reflecting upon a philosophical problem there may be little consciousness of effort, yet the mind may be intensely active, whilst in attending to a trivial conversation when one is fatig,ued the consciousness of effort may be great whilst the activity of the mind is at a mninimum. Strain or effort, as experienced, is no less a content or object of consciousness thain a red colour, as experienced, is a content or object of conscious- ness, and whoever recognises the distinction between the red colour and the act of apprehending it is bound in consistency likewise to recognise the distinction between the strain or effort and the act of apprehending, it. There can be little doubt that</page><page sequence="31">THE NATURE 01' WILLING. 57 sense-presentations are involved in both experiences,-visual presentations in the one, kin-esthetic presentations in the other,*-and he who questions the legitimnacy of describing the red colour as a mental fact is equally entitled to question the legitimacy of describing the effort or strain as a mental fact. I do not, indeed, suppose that the awareness of strain or effort, as it comes forward in the mature mental life, can be resolved ilnto the awareness of miuscular and inotor factors alone. Just as the per- ceptioni of an external object implies mlich else than the directly apprehended sense-qualities, so the experience of strain or effort implies, in addition to the actual sense-data of the moment, a mulltiplicity of other ingredients the preselnce of which can only be rencdered explicable by having regard to the way in which mental life develops. The awareniess, on our part, of strain or effort evinces itself as, fromn a psychological point of view, the result of a long repetition of experiences, and the appearance of simiplicity which that awareness comes to exhibit ought not to be allowed to disguise from us its psychologically complicated character. If looked at in the light of the conditions that give rise to the consciousness of self, it is not difficult to uniderstanid how such strain or effort comes to wear the aspect of self- activity, comes to appear as the putting forth of power or energy on the part of the self. The experiences that ensue from movemenits of the body and its limbs are comparatively regular and uniform in character as contrasted with the in- definite variety of presentations that come about in consequence of such nmovement, and thus provide one basis at least for the gradual recog,nition by the subject of a distinction between his own inner life and what is other than, or extraneous to, that life. So again, and for a similar reason, the intra-organic muscular presentations come to form part of the trains of feelings, ideas and impulses, constitutinc the content of our * See, for example, the interesting experime-its of which Dewey gives an account in his article on "The Psychology of Effort," Phil. R., vi, 1897, p. 43 sqq.</page><page sequence="32">58 G. DAWES HICKS. awareness of self, and, as the invariable precursors of bodily movement, they naturally tend to awaken memory-imnages of suchi movement,-a circurnstance of primary importance in this particular reference. Consider, for example, the familiar experience that is ours on the occasion (say) of lifting a heavy weight. Presentations of tension or strain come to us, thein, fromni all parts of the body, not merely froin the muscles that are directly concerned. But we apprehend them as onie complex mass, and this complex mass seems to have a single anld independent existence of its own aind to be the cause of the bodily movement instead of being, as it actually is, the concomitant and consequent of such movement. No one, I imag,ine, would argue that, in this case, the experienced tension or strain is identical with the mental activity inivolved in being aware of it. But is there any more reason for supposing that the effort or strain experienced in an act of will, because it likewise appears to be self-activity, is veritably identical witlh the mental activity of willincg ? I venture to imiainitaini that such an identification is without justification and leads to a wholly false conceptioin of the nature of the activity properly described as mental. I revert now to the power possessed by a self-conscious subject of controlling or recrulating his actions. We can, to an extent however that is limited, control our bodily movements, and, in like manner, our trains of thoug,ht and feeling. In neither case is it easy to determine how the result, which is familiar enough, is brought about. One thing, at aniy rate, has already been made sufficiently obvious. Whether we are carrying out or controlling bodily movements, we are, as experiencing subjects, in total ignorance of the iiechanism by which the actual movement is effected. Bodily m-lovements come about as natural facts according to strictly nlatural laws,. and we becomle aware of them as we become aware of all other natural facts,-through means, namiiely, of groups of presenta- tions anid feelings. These gcroups connect themselves with</page><page sequence="33">THE NATURE OF WILLING. 59 presentations and re-presenitations which are not presentations and re-presentations of bodily movements. The kind of con- niexion which is involved in the execution of a movemenit is, therefore, that of correspondence or correlation, and the correspondence or correlation has limits the conditions of which lie beyond the cognisance of the individual coniscious subject. The nature of the enmpirical connexions in question can probably best be discovered by observation of the manner in which movements are acquired by learning, a matter concerning which much careful experimental research has lately been reported. Take, for instance, the simple experiment of inclosinga an animal, a cat or a dog, in a box, fitted with a door closed by an easy device, anld noticinog the methods by which the animal attempts to release itself. At first, its movements will be altogether indefinite and misdirected. The animal will bite here, there, and everywhere, indiscriminately, scratch at each crevice and projectingc part at random, until in the end by some one of the movements it happens to succeed in openingo the door. If, now, the experiment be repeated, a similar series of randomn movements will be gonle through, until again the successful movement is by chance performed. With frequent repetition, the time required will gradually (lecrease, and finally the necessary movement will be executecl at olnce without the preliminary of the random trials. Or, take the case of the acquisition of skill in certain human accomplishments, such as learning to ride a bicycle. The human subject brings to the task a mind already inured to voluntary actions, but in his first attenmpts at orientation on wheels he will probably go to work very much after the manner of the animal in the box. He will begin with a number of haphazard moveements that will eind unisatisfactorily, until he hits by chance upon the movenient he has been informed will prevent the machine from falling. And the likelihood is that when at length he does get accustomeld to the right adjustmenits, he will have nlo clear idea of how he came to make them. " They came to me," will be his account of</page><page sequence="34">60 G. DAWES HICKS. the matter, "all at once." Ordinarily he will have to repeat the requisite moveinents a large number of times accidentally before lie recognises exactly how to do them again, or is able to succeed at the first trial, whilst ultirmatelv the machine will becoime to him almiost as part of his body, and be worked by him in a like habitual way. Or, take the interestinc investigation undertaken by Bair of the conditionis involved in gettin, voluntary control of the mnuscle behind the ear, the so-called retrahens, the contraction of which causes the ear to move.* .Most people have no control over this muscle, and twelve of those experimented upon had nio idea of the nmovemiient and could not produce it. The muscle, however, is adequately supplied with both motor and sensory nerves and there is no reason to doubt that control over it is acquired in a manner similar to that in which control is acquired over any other muscle. The attempt was first made to teach those experi- mented upon the use of the muscle by artificially contracting it through means of an electric current. But although a definite kimesthetic presentation of the movement was given again and again by the artificial contraction, the movement could not be reproduced when the current was withdrawn. Not until the subjects succeeded in associating the movement with that of other muscles, such as those of the brow and jaw, over which control was already acquired, did the movemient take place voluntarily. Then, by keeping attention fixed on tlhe required movement, and neglectinog the others, it was possible to single it out of the group and get independent control over it. After such isolation, at first both ears nmoved, and one muscle could not be contracted alone. But by a sirmiilar process of attending to the one and neglecting the other, the facility was finally acquired of moving either ear alone at will. I need not multiply illustrations. The conclusion they * " The Development of Voluntary Control," by J. H.

Bodily movements are, at first, evren miiore vague and chaotic in character thani the vague ancd indefined presentations and re-presentations which precede them. But in their own way, they follow a line of advance closely resembling that followed in presentations and re-presentations. The latter come by degrees to exhibit a richer variety of conteilt, a larger number of elemnents are (listinguished in and through wlhat appears to be one mental act, and a single re-presentation may come to serve as a sign of, or as a substitute for, a train of connected images and nmeimiories. So, in like manner, movemnents become gradually more specific and precise, fall into regular groups and series, and these are readily associated with the one prominent re-presentation or idea that is in connexion with thein. We exercise voluintary con-trol over such movements by dwelling, on the one proiminenit re-presentation or idea, and more or less on the trains of revived motor presentations that have come to be associate(d with it. Mir. Bradley protests that there is no room at this point to intrude wit,h a faculty of Apperception or Attentioni, andl, if the emphasis be on "faculty," I agree. But it is prinmarily anid essentially attention, not as a faculty but as the process of retaining the content of an idea or re-presenta- tion for a longer time than would otherwise be the case in consciousness and of increasing, by completer discrimination, the clearness and distinctniess of its apprehension, that, froml all the instanices referred to, one would conclude to lie at the root of the voluntary control to which we attain over our bodily movements, as also over our trains of thought.* Attention would, therefore, appear to be the central fact on the side of our practical no less than on the side of our intellectual life. * Bair, for example, emphasises in the strongest mannler the fuLnda- mental importance of attention in acquiring control over the movemient he was investigating. Cf. miy article on " The Nature and Developmenit of Attention " in British Jo?tr;i?al of Psychology, vol. vi, p. 1.</page><page sequence="36">62 G. DAW-TTS HICKS. Voluntary control over our movements is acquired in that way, but the execution of the movements which we thus control is another matter. I have been contending, that such execu- tion depenids upon a correlation of nmental and bodily processes of which the subject has no knowledge and with which he cannot interfere. If that contention be sound, it compels us, I think, to reject the definition of will as " the self-realisation of an idea." Mr. Bradley urges that "the idea iimust itself alter the existence to its own nature, or, in other words, the idea mnust itself carry itself out into the chaniged existence."* If by "idea" be meant, as I gather evidently is mneant, the content apprehended, then the consi(lerations we have lhad before us seem sufficienit to warrant the contrary assertion that the idea neither alters the existence to its own niature nor in any way itself carries itself out. In other words, it is not itself an existing agency by which any change in the realm of existing fact could be accomiplished. Mr. Bradley, it is true, recognises that the idea is Inot the whole complex cause which goes before anid issues in the effect; but, he insists, it eniters inlto the causal sequence so as to make the (lifference by which the effect is pro(luced. I raise niot nlow any question as to the propriety of this mode of expression; it is sufficient, for niy purpose, to submit that in any case what enters into the causal series is not the idea or conitent willed but can only be the process or act of willing, It is, I conceive, the process or act which is the mnental occurrence, and of the mental process or act as such we nave, so far as I can discover, no more direct knowledge than we have of the bodily processes. Undoubtedly between the muental process of willing and the bodily processes involved in the execution of movement there subsists a relation peculiarly close and intimate, whatever precise kind of relation it may be. It was largely in view of this consideration that I was * ffind, N.S., xi, 1902, p. 441.</page><page sequence="37">THE NATURE OF WILLING. 63 led, in a former paper,* to maintain that there must be an internal qualitative difference between mental acts or processes, ,other than the difference which consists merely in the fact that one mental act is directed upon one entity and another nmental act upon a different entity. If the latter be conceived as the only difference, I am at a loss to understand how a correlation between specific acts of mind and specific bodily processes can be rendered in any measure intelligible. Our inquiry terminates on the threshold of a large meta- physical problem. Whilst contending that the idea is, in part, the cauise of the result in which its content is realised, Mr. Bradley allows, as I have said, that it is not the sole cause. There still remains, in his view, to be explained how it is that this idea, in distinction from that otlher idea, is able to realise its own special existence. In order to account for the passing, in any given case, of a particular idea to its own particular realisation, there is necessary, he thinks, somne machinery of a certain definite kind. The machinery consists, so he argues, on the one hand, in a variety of special " dispositions," and, on the other hand, in the presence of some suggested idea, which idea serves, at the same time, to start some one special disposition. The passage in volition from idea to fact is made by a bridge. And the bridge is a disposition the latter elenment of which has, through experience, become qualified in idea by its starting point. Dispositions may, he tells us, be merely physical as at first, or may later become so, and they may be physical wholly or merely in some part of their subordinate detail. But, to serve in volition proper as a means of transition, a disposition must, in all cases, possess a psychical aspect. Psychologically, a disposition is a standing tendency-the tendency for one of two connected elements, physical or psychical, to appear in coilsequence of the other being given.t I have no desire to quarrel with the notion of special dispositions-a notion which, * Cf. Proceedings, vol. x, 1910, 1). 2 7 7. t Bfind, N.S., xiii, 1904, p. 22 sqq.</page><page sequence="38">64 G. DAWV7ES HICKS. in onie form or another, is widely current in ma-odern psycho- logical theory. But in endeavouriring to solve the perplexing problemi that here confronts us by calling in the lnotionl of special dispositions, we are doino little muore than giving a name to a highly complicated set of coinditions, concerning the nature of which we have little or no definite knowledge. And I suspect that too often the notion does but serve the familiar device of providing a tertium, qtid between two modes of being that seem otherwise to resist the attempt to think of them as initelligibly coninected. One thing certainly can be saicl to stand out clearly from the line of reflexion I have been following. We need radically to change our ordinary concep- tion of the body and its operationis if we are to understand the way in which it serves the function of an organ of mind. Dr. Bosanquet puts the matter not a bit too strongly whenl he says that "finite consciousness and the finite self come late, on the top of immense stores of unconscious mechanismi and adaptation, which are, to all appearance, its precondition."* I can safely leave those wlho have followed the course of tlhe argmment to draw fronii it the mnoral with respect to the issue I alluided to in introducing the suibject. I will add only somle observationis of quite general import. In the first place, if the analysis of will yields the factors which I have tried to slhow it does yield, it is obviouis that to speak of the will as involved iin thinking, or of thought as involved in willing, is to emplov psychologically inaccurate modes of expression. What is really meant is that both willing, and thinking are exceedingoly complex states of mind which possess many features in comIlmont besides features which are specific to each. In the secondl place, mental activity cannot legitimately be identified withl conation. Even if we were warranted in saying that every * The Principle of Individuality and Value, p. 219. Perhaps I may mention that the first part of my paper was written before reading Dr. Bosanquet's book. I am gratified to find how largely it is in accord with Dr. Bosanquet;s powerful chapter on Body and Mind.</page><page sequence="39">THE NATURE OF WILLIN\G. 65 mental act must of necessity containi the element of impulse or striving, yet it is assuiredly not impulse or striving which constitutes the essential characteristic of the activity of consciousness as contrasted with the consciouisness of activity. Mental activity consists not in the bare fact that, in each of its phases, the mnind is directed upon an object, but consists rather in what is intrinsically the nature of a state of mind as the awareness of something. The aw6areiness is the activity, and the awareness is active becauise there is impliedl in it always the fuinetion of discriminating and comparing-a function which is fundamental in a nmental act whether it be an act of thouight or of volition. In the third place, it is manifestly the case that when the consciousniess of self has been reached and an individual subject has become capable of thinking and willing in the strict sense, the notions and coneeptions he will first mlake use of are of the kind which inay be called, fairly enough, practical. The relation between the individual aind the changes in his environmlent which ensuie in consequence of his owni volitions are so constant that naturally such relation must largely influence his reflective consideration of things. The primitive suibject's modes of thouight, in other words, will be anthropomorphic in character. He will frame, for instance, his idea of the causal connexion of things after the model supplied by the initiation of bodily movement through means of mnuscular effort. But the psychological analysis of volition enables us to be oni our guard against any sweeping, generalisa- tion from this fact. For, it shows, oni the one hand, that conduct, in order to be practical, must be based uipon experience of real fact, and caninot, therefore, wholly misrepresent it, and, on the other hand, that there is niothing in the nature of volition which can permanently stand in the way of a rationial and philosophical interpretation of the universe of reality.</page></plain_text>
