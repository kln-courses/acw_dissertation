<plain_text><page sequence="1">Molecular Biology Made Simple and Fun David P. Clark and Lonnie D. Russell. Cache River Press, Vienna, Illinois. 470 p. 1997. [ISBN 0-9627422-9-5] This book was written with the intention of presenting the basics of molecular ge- netics in a way that would make the sub- ject more interesting to students and non- scientists. The format and style include less technical vocabulary and more con- versational phrasing, with humorous quips and figures added to lighten the tone. The authors, both Ph.D. scientists, were in- spired to provide a text with broad appeal, providing a resource to inform the layper- son about a topic that is rapidly becoming an important part of our daily lives. Their objective is well-founded, since molecular biology and biotechnology are becoming increasingly important in human and vet- erinary medicine, forensic science, agri- cultural and environmental science, con- servation biology, and the study of evolution and systematics. The applica- tion of this technology also invokes novel ethical and moral questions, which will best be addressed or resolved through dis- cussion among informed citizenry. The book presents many topics, but does so with relatively few words. In targeting a broad audience, the authors reach a mid- dle ground by providing sufficient infor- mation to inform the reader, but not so much to be daunting. The level of detail could be a bit overwhelming to a nonsci- entist or even to a biologist unfamiliar with current fundamental topics of cell and molecular biology. Conversely, a biol- ogy student interested in gaining expertise in molecular biology would be exasperat- ed by the lack of depth in the explanation of those topics. For those readers seeking further sources of information on particu- lar subjects, the authors included suggest- ed readings at the end of each chapter. The information presented is accurate, current, and represents the cutting-edge of modern biology, but if the reader is seeking a thor- ough reference book, there are others that better serve this purpose. The reader will find keywords highlighted in the text and Volume 18 (1), 1998 Natural Areas Journal 91</page><page sequence="2">definitions of those words or terms in the margins of nearly every page. These go a long way in helping the reader overcome a major roadblock to mastering molecular biology: learning and understanding the vocabulary. A key feature of the book is the emphasis on presenting information through comic diagrams, rather than in extensive and descriptive text. Nearly all the figures in- clude corny puns or anthropomorphic rep- resentations of microbes or biological molecules, which tend to palliate the diffi- cult reading material. There is a striking absence of figures with actual data or full- color photographs and micrographs, since most of the figures are drawings printed in black and pink. The use of oversimplified diagrams and drawings is intended to high- light particular concepts, but in general they are less demonstrative than the full- color renditions found in other texts. How- ever, the illustrations are effective in light of the objectives of the book; these images will strike a chord with many readers by matching a humorous image with a con- fusing term or biochemical reaction. The authors follow a modular format, striv- ing to make each chapter a self-contained unit. This leads to some redundancy, but for the most part easier reading. The orga- nization of topics proceeds logically from a general foundation in cell biology, mi- crobiology, and genetics, to more detailed procaryotic and eucaryotic genetics. The initial chapters discuss the processes of DNA replication, inheritance, gene expres- sion, and protein synthesis. These provide a basis for later chapters that expand on current tools and techniques used in mo- lecular biology, commercial products of biotechnology, and current issues at the forefront of biology and medicine. Two chapters are dedicated to discussion of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and to determination and analysis of DNA se- quence. These techniques represent im- portant tools in modern forensics, system- atics, and the study of evolution, each of which is also covered in a chapter. Several of the later chapters present some of the genetic components of human medicine that have been elucidated by molecular techniques. Readers should find a number of the topics discussed stimulating and relevant, no matter what their field of in- terest. Reviewed by: Lawrence B.
