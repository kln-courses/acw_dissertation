I. On the 5th of March, 1883, Mr. Foote, Mr. Eamsey, and Mr. Kemp -were jointly indicted for blasphemous libel, before Mr. Justice North, at the Central Criminal Court. Mr. Foote, in his defence as reported in the Times, referred to the works of Mr. John Stuart Mill, Mr. James Mill, Shelley, Byron, Professor Huxley, Mr. Leslie Stephens, Mr. Matthew Arnold, Viscount Am- berley, and Mr. Herbert Spencer, and to " The Evolution of Christianity." Now, as I am the author of the latter work, I may reasonably claim the privilege of saying a few words as to the relationslnp of these judicial proceedings to legitimate freedom of expression, in disclosing the results of scientific research or of theo¬ logical criticism, however destructive of the venerable traditions which flourished in pre-Colensic and pre- Darwinian ages, with a vitality unsuggestive of impend¬ ing dissolution. Mr. Foote apparently referred to these works with the view of justifying the publication of the illustrated</page><page sequence="4">4 Christmas number of the Freethinker; but Mr. Justice North said, " I consider this publication totally different from any of the works you have brought before me, in every way." I have never seen the illustrated or any other number of the Freethinker, but, judged through Mr. Foote's own admissions in his defence, I think the actively aggres¬ sive tendencies of that publication establish a marked distinction between its contents and the works of men, who publish their sceptical conclusions in absolute unconsciousness of any desire to evoke religious hostility. I do not, however, therefore question the sincerity of Mr. Foote. As there is a fanaticism of faith, so also there may be a fanaticism of unbelief; and we cannot deny honesty of purpose to a man who displayed abilities in his defence, which might certainly be employed much more to his individual advantage than in editing or publishing the Freethinker. In thus disavowing all sympathy with actively aggressive scepticism, I do not the less disapprove of all prosecutions for blasphemy, as survivals of mediaeval intolerance, far more prejudicial to all which is best in the teaching of Christianity than that confidence in the final triumph of truth, which fears not the expression of any form of religious or irreligious opinion. I regret that a British jury, controlled by our legal heritage from generations which conscientiously burnt heretics, should have felt the obligation to record a conviction on that ill-omened charge of blasphemy, inseparably asso¬ ciated with the trial and condemnation of Socrates and of Jesus. I deplore the severity of the sentence pronounced by a British Judge, in the doubtlessly conscientious</page><page sequence="5">5 interpretation of his judicial duties. And I hail with satisfaction the announcement contained in the Times of the 12th of May, that liberal divines, eminent professors, distinguished physicians, and enlightened journalists, have united with others in signing a memorial to the Home Secretary, praying for the remission of the sentence passed on Messrs. Foote, Bamsey, and Kemp for blasphemous libel. Assuming that the motives of the Prosecution are traceable to that honest zeal for religion, which formerly sent Jews and heretics to the stake for the honour and glory of God, are the results of these trials for blasphemy favourable to the pious design of self-appointed defenders of Divinity? On the 24th of April last, Mr. Foote and Mr. Bamsey were brought forth from prison, to be indicted before the Lord Chief Justice on a second charge of blasphemous libel, based on the contents of other numbers of the Freethinker. The jury having disagreed, the prisoners were liable to be again tried, but the lamentable conditions of privation under which they had been obliged to prepare their defence, gave to the prosecution an aspect of religious persecution, which happily resulted in the termination of proceedings ; and Mr. Foote, rendered famous by his very able defence, has been sent back to prison, whence he shall again come forth as a hero and a martyr in the eyes of his admiring followers. Let us consider the embarrassing position of her Majesty's Judges when called on to preside at trials for blasphemy, a quarter of a century after the hearing of any similar case—an interval during which the progress of criticism and the revelations of science have revolu-</page><page sequence="6">6 tionised the faith, not only of educated laymen, but of eminent divines, whose candid disclosure of the results of laborious research has changed living dogmas into dead superstitions. Men of the mature age of our Judges were doubtless taught in their youth, that " the Bible is the infallible record of the mind and will of God, conveyed by direct inspiration to holy men of old, who spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. The Bible, like its Author, is pure unchangeable truth —truth without any admixture of error." But all this was surrendered under the decision (February 8th, 1864) of her Majesty's Privy Council (including the Archbishop of Canterbury), in the case of the Bishop of Salisbury v. Be v. Bowland Williams, one of the Essayists and Be viewers, that it is not an ecclesiastical offence, even for the clergy, " to dispute the dates and authorship of the several Books of the Old and New Testaments, to deny the reality of any of the facts contained in the Holy Scriptures, to reject parts of Scripture upon their own opinion that the narrative is inherently incredible, to disregard precepts in Holy Writ because they think them evidently wrong," so long as they keep clear of contradicting any doctrine laid down in the Articles or formularies of the Church of England. In other words, the infallibility of Scripture is surrendered in favour of the infallibility of the so- called creed of Athanasius, now viewed with repugnance by many clergymen of the Church of England. The eminent Barristers who attain to the dignity of the Bench are, as a rule, men who have been too deeply absorbed in the arduous duties of their profession to ha\e found many moments of leisure for revising the</page><page sequence="7">7 faith of their youth, in the light of that scientific theo¬ logy which flourishes in the days of their maturity. Let us, therefore, put ourselves in the place of a British Judge, conscientiously convinced of the infallibility of the Bible and of the wisdom of interpreting the law of blasphemy through the dicta of Blaekstone, called upon to j&gt;reside at the trial of a man accused of profane scoffing at the following words of Scripture :—" For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one " *— a passage which has been accepted for centuries by English Bible readers as a divine confirmation of the truth of the Trinitarian dogma. The culprit, however, submits to the Court a copy of the Revised Version of the New Testament, in which the eminent scholars who accomplished that great work have struck out the passage as a mediaeval corruption of the text. But what answer can be given to this still more serious charge against the accused He has sjtoken in an even more disrespectful manner of the following most important passage in Scripture, supposed to record the very words of the second Person in the Trinity after His resurrection:—" And He said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe ; in My name shall they cast out devils ; they shall speak with new tongues ; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover." f The prisoner, how- * 1 John v. 7. t Mark xvi. 15-18.</page><page sequence="8">8 ever, again refers to the Revised Version, in which an ominous blank separates the last twelve verses of the Gospel according to St. Mark from the preceding pas¬ sage, and the Revisers insert the following note in the margin :—" The two oldest Greek manuscripts, and some other authorities, omit from verse 9 to the end. Some other authorities have a different ending to the Gospel." An intelligent juryman now volunteers the remark— " Our infallible New Testament is not the Revised, but the Authorized Version, approved by our Church and Bishops." But the irrepressible culprit forthwith pro¬ duces volume I. of the " New Testament Commentary," edited by Dr. Ellicott, Lord Bishop of Gloucester, which contains the following note on the last twelve verses of Mark's Gospel:—" The history of the verses that follow are in every way remarkable. They are not found in two of the oldest manuscripts—the Sinaitic and the Vatican—are marked as doubtful in many others, and are wanting in some versions." The learned commen¬ tators suggest, as the most probable solution of the dis¬ crepancy, " That the Gospel, having been originally com¬ pleted by the writer, was in some way, by accident or design, mutilated, that as such it was reproduced faith¬ fully by some transcribers, while others thought it better to give it a completion of some kind, by condensing what they found in the other Gospels "—an apologetic hypothesis not very reassuring for believers in an infalli¬ ble New Testament, when they consider that it is on the alleged inspiration of this haphazard completion of the Gospel according to St. Mark that Christianity consigns unbaptised babes to eternal fire.</page><page sequence="9">9 There remains, however, the startling charge against the prisoner, that he has profanely scoffed at sacred Scripture, through the calumnious misstatement that it sustains the actual existence of the mythical Phoenix, and even assigns to it the fabulous longevity of five hun¬ dred years Now, as both Judge and Jury are absolutely certain that this must be a malicious aspersion of that Holy Bible, the familiar contents of which they recall through the Sunday-school lessons of their ingenuous youth, the case apparently assumes a very serious aspect for the accused. But the undaunted sceptic declares that his statement refers to the Bible of the fifth cen¬ tury, as contained in the Codex Alexandrinus, an ancient manuscript now in the British Museum, whieh sustains the fable of the Phoenix on the inspired authority of the first Epistle of Clement, then forming part of the infal¬ lible Bible of some Christians. Is it neeessary that I should proceed any further with this typical prosecution, in order to convince all candid and impartial inquirers that charges of blas¬ phemy, under the dicta of Blackstone and other legal luminaries of pre-Colensie ages, are absolutely irrecon¬ cilable with the theological conditions of our generation —conditions so perplexing to even the most eminent divines of the Angliean Church, that they must view with disfavour the intolerant zeal of amateur " defenders of the Faith," who would conduet the delicate task of Biblical criticism within the walls of a Poliee-Court or the precincts of the Old Bailey, and stake the truths of Christianity on the skill of a lawyer, the charge of a Judge, and the verdict of a jury On the 25th of April last, Lord Coleridge, in his a 5</page><page sequence="10">io charge to the Jury on the trial of Mr. Foote and Mr. Ramsey, vindicated the intelligence of our age through a comprehensive interpretation of the present law of blasphemous libel, which finally disposes of the legal fallacy, that Christianity is the common law of a com¬ munity, whose most eminent Judges may profess the Hebrew faith. " The law visits not the honest errors, but the malice of mankind." "If the decencies of controversy are observed, even the fundamentals of religion may be attacked, without the writer being guilty of blasphemy." These are the combined dicta of Mr. Starkie and Lord Coleridge, which briefly define the spirit in which the present law of blasphemous libel should be administered in harmony with the changed conditions involved in the liberal legislation of half a century, until public opinion in this country shall be ripe for the repeal or modifi¬ cation of statutes which now perpetuate the honest but misguided intolerance of our ancestors, legislating in the " dim religious light " of pre-scientific ages. II. Passing from the consideration of the recent trials for blasphemy to the Parliamentary debate on the Affirma- mation Bill, the standpoint of the candid and impartial inquirer into the tendencies and results of that embittered discussion is the standpoint of Mr. Gladstone, as defined in his speech delivered in the House of Commons on the 26th of April last, through which he heroically sought to separate a question involving the great principle of</page><page sequence="11">11 religious freedom from the misguiding influence of envenomed hostility to the claims of an individual. A century hence that speech will be recognized as the most enduring monument of the intellectual and moral great¬ ness of Mr. Gladstone; but it was spoken above the heads of the majority of the present House of Commons, who, seeing in Mr. Bradlaugh the all-powerful magician, through whose presence among them the British Con¬ stitution and the Christian religion are doomed to perish, could not approach the subject in a judicial spirit of impartial inquiry into the expediency of abolishing one of the surviving relics of religious intolerance—that appalling scourge of humanity which, having ceased, in its decrepitude, to demand the blood of its victims, still uplifts its hydra-head to warn off, with obloquy and menace, even the noblest friend of liberty, who may employ all the resources of human eloquence in advocating, that yet one more fetter may be struck off from the intellec¬ tual freedom of mankind. The negative results of the debate have now placed an Affirmation Bill without the immediate range of prac¬ tical politics; but the important expressions of opinion elicited by the discussion inevitably raises the question —What is the present attitude of the Conservative party towards the principle of religious freedom Turning to the speech of Lord Randolph Churchill, delivered in the House of Commons on the 30th of April last, he informs his auditors that "much of the Prime Minister's speech was far above his feeble compre¬ hension." The admirable candour of this admission becomes obvious as we carefully study the contents of the three columns in the Times of the 1st of May last, which,</page><page sequence="12">mmmmmmmmmmmmm 12 no doubt, faithfully record the views of the noble member for Woodstock on the subject of the Affirmation Bill. " One feature of Mr. Gladstone's speech struck him very much—the right honourable gentleman did not dwell upon the rights of Northampton or of Mr. Bradlaugh." No, for in this omission lies the comprehensive states¬ manship which sought to disentangle the principle of religious freedom from the elements of political strife, conjured by the name of the junior member for North¬ ampton. In discussing the theological aspect of the question, Lord Randolph Churchill states that "the God of the Christians and the God of the Jews were one and the same. The difference of opinion arose as to the nature and. form, but there was no difference as to the essence or the attributes." Does not this dogmatic formula, to which the speaker gives the name of " abstract theology," suggest that the House of Commons has been suddenly transformed into the Council of Nicaea, which, more than fifteen centuries ago, held a tumultous debate, and determined, by a majority of votes, the substance of Divinity The noble lord proceeds to enunciate a fresh novelty in " abstract theology " by affirming that " Judaism was only separated from Arianism by a degree, or rather, he should say, that Arianism was an improvement and an advance on Judaism." The absence of tumultuous uproar at the utterance of these words at once dispels the illusion that the speaker is addressing the Council of NicsBa; for that episcopal assembly met to consider the relative merits of Arian and Athanasian theosophy, which differed only in this, that the one maintained that</page><page sequence="13">13 the second Person in the Trinity was of the same, whilst the other affirmed that He was only of like substance with the Father; and although the majority of the Council condemned the thesis of Arius, they would not therefore have heard with less horror and dismay that an Arian is only an improved kind of Jew, whereas a faithful follower of Moses necessarily denies the pos¬ session of any substance whatsoever to a Being whom he regards as a merely phantasmal Divinity. Further¬ more, as the devout Jew of the fourth century heard the vindictive anathemas and witnessed the appalling cruelties which both Arians and Athanasians inflicted on each other whilst quarrelling in the name of Chris¬ tianity over the substance of their God, could he have experienced any preferential community of faith with the Arian because his shibboleth * differed but by one letter in the alphabet from, thatf of his Athanasian antagonist Lord Randolph Churchill thus continues his dis¬ course: "An impartial student of the life and times of Athanasius would have no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that, as far as it was possible and lawful X to pry into the causes which regulate the progress of religious thought, it was owing to accident as much, as anything else that the whole of Europe at the present moment was not Arian. The acceptance of the settle¬ ment of that great religious schism depended entirely upon the caprices of a despotic emperor, the intrigues of * Homoiousia (of similar substance). t Homoousia (of the same substance). J It might be interesting to theological students to know what law, human or divme, limits thoir inquiries into the causes which regulate the progress of religious thought.</page><page sequence="14">mmmmmmmm 14 " an Oriental court, and upon the hairbreadth escapes of an adventurous bishop. He had only stated that, as an argument, that it was not wonderful that in the nine¬ teenth century the State should have been extremely tolerant, when Jewish emancipation was under discussion, of all forms of Arianis7n." * With what amazement must not educated Jews now learn, for the first time, from the lips of the noble member for Woodstock that the fact of their religion being " a form of Arianism" exercised an important influence on the motives of the liberal- minded statesmen who incurred the obloquy of Christian zealots by advocating the justiee of their claims to freedom! The argument from fortuitous creeds may be ex¬ tended indefinitely. Thus, had not Charles Martel defeated the Saracens on then invasion of France in the eighth century, Europe would have been overrun by the victorious armies of the Arabian Prophet, and Englishmen would now be found worshipping, not in domed cathedrals, but in minareted mosques. When, therefore, Lord Randolph Churchill assures the House of Commons that his present faith in the Nicene Creed was contingent, fifteen centuries ago, on the caprice of a despot and the intrigues of a court, is he not uncon¬ sciously advocating the unconditional toleration of every form and shade of religious opinion on the grounds of their possibly fortuitous origin Lord Randolph Churchill, again turning aside from * Is it not a curious coincidence that, as stated in Mr. Gladstone's speech, one of Lord Eandolph Churchill's Arian friends was burnt in England, in 1614, through that spirit of religious intolerance now advocated in a milder form That unhappy Arian was obviously the liiadlaugh ol hit, generation.</page><page sequence="15">15 the one and only true political motive for the enfran¬ chisement of the Jews, namely, national recognition of the great principle of religious freedom, sees in the prospective restoration of the entire Semitic race as devout Trinitarians to the land of Palestine a reason why Christians admitted " people with such a future to equal privileges with themselves." But, as he himself periodically prays that a beneficent God may "have mercy upon all Jews, Turks, infidels, and heretics, and take from them all ignorance, hardness of heart, and contempt of Thy word,- and so fetch them home, blessed Lord, to Thy flock, that they may be saved among the remnant of the true Israelites, and be made one fold under one Shepherd, Jesus Christ our Lord," should not Lord Randolph Churchill, in harmony with his own reasoning, invite even a despised Atheist within the Christian atmosphere of the House of Commons, in the full assurance of faith that he also may yet become a " true Israelite " Continuing to discuss the Semitic aspect of the question, the noble member for Woodstock "ventured to say that if any member of that House advocated the claims of Mr. Bradlaugh by comparing them with the claims of the Jews, he inflicted upon that ancient people a fouler insult and a crueler wrong than was ever devised by mediaeval fanaticism." Modern Jews would, therefore, prefer confiscation, torture, and even death to the suggestion of any analogy between then claims and those of the junior member for Northampton! In thus expressing his doubtlessly conscientious con¬ victions, are the views of the noble lord sustained by the advantages of consistency? A negative response</page><page sequence="16">16 is the inevitable result of collating the following cita¬ tions :— " The moral sanctions which controlled both Jews and Chris¬ tians were in many respects similar. There was nothing in the Jewish creed or character which could in the slightest de¬ gree detract from any pledge which they might give, or unfit them for public confidence, or deprive them of general respect." " If the profession of Chris¬ tianity were the surest guarantee for the faithful discharge of private and social duties, much more must it be the best or the only known guarantee for those high and important functions on which the character and happi¬ ness of our people depended." Which of these conflicting statements records the veritable views of Lord Randolph Churchill According to the first, the creed of Judaism, which absolutely denies the truth of Christianity, is reconcilable with the conscientious fulfilment of social and political obligations; but according to the second, the illustrious Judge, whose loss has been so recently deplored by his Sovereign and by the nation, was deficient in the " only known guarantee " for the fulfilment of his judical functions, because he neither professed nor believed the Christian religion. Well might all Jews, on hearing or reading the speech of the noble member for Woodstock, emphati¬ cally exclaim, " Save us from our friends " Is Lord Randolph Churchill more happy and con¬ sistent when he discusses other aspects of the question He considers that Mr. Bradlaugh represents " only himself," and yet his admission into the House of Commons might cause the people to despair of im¬ mortality, and even adopt, as their Bible, " The Fruits of Philosophy." He is convinced that great statesmen opposed the affirmation of the Society of Friends because they were fearful of imperilling Christian morality, and</page><page sequence="17">17 yet those modern Essenes comply with the precepts of the Founder of Christianity by declining the utterance of an oath. And he reveals to the House of Commons, that " the peculiarity of the English Constitution was, that it was founded upon and incorporated with the Christian morality. It was a characteristic which was possessed by no other nation, however free, or however great; and did it not occur to them, that the extraordi¬ nary prosperity and duration and apparent future of our Empire was not, perhaps, unconnected with this famous characteristic " If any of the ambassadors of the Great Powers were present at this debate, with what amaze¬ ment must they have listened to language which thus depicts the British nation posing sanctimoniously as the lineal descendants of the Pharisee, who thanked God that he was so much more virtuous than his neighbours If national longevity is a proof of national righteousness, should not the palm of virtue be assigned rather to the celestial " Chinee," than to the saintly Briton? And if we now begin to boast of our " aj)parent future," may we not be providing materials for the Papuan Gibbon of the thirtieth century, who shall write, with retrospective melancholy, the history of the Decline and Fall of the British Empire I need not follow the noble member for Woodstock into that interpretation of British statutes which would revive the religious intolerance of past generations, for his legal inaccuracies have been fully and ably exposed by the Solicitor-General. But when, in his zeal to establish that Christianity is the common law of the land, he states that " he knew it was denied by Lord Coleridge the other day—but Lord Coleridge was obtain-</page><page sequence="18">18 ing an unfortunate celebrity for allowing his political opinions to be incidently set forth from the judicial Bench; and though Lord Coleridge might be a distin¬ guished Judge, no one had ever claimed for him that he was a great lawyer"—it becomes the duty of all men, who respect the judicial institutions of this country, to protest, with unqualified reprobation, against this most indecorous conversion of Parliamentary privileges into the media of contumelious reflections on a Judge, to whom posterity will assign a foremost place among the Lord Chief Justices of England, rendered illustrious by the moral and intellectual power which impartially determines the rights of individuals, in absolute freedom from the prejudice evoked by their political or religious opinions. In opening his speech, Lord Randolph Churchill referred to the possible apparition of some mediaeval theologian; but, as I listen to his comments on Lord Coleridge, the shadowy form which I, in imagination, see, is that of Lord Beaconsfield appearing for one brief moment in the arena of his former defeats and triumphs, to cast a sad, reproachful, warning glance on him who thus forgets the highest traditions of the House of Commons. And, as that form fades from mental vision, I see it majestically draped in the mantle, which falls not, therefore, on the expectant shoulders of any present member of the House of Commons. Perhaps it may assist us, in forming an impartial judgment of Lord Randolph Churchill's speech on the Affirmation Bill, to briefly refer to his treatment of some other subject in the House of Commons. On the 11th of May last, he said: "It was stated—and the statement</page><page sequence="19">19 could be substantiated—that Omar Lufti, the present Minister of War, who was Governor of Alexandria at the time of the massacres of the 11th of June, was the agent of the Khedive in getting up that massacre. Arabi Pasha said that he would preserve order ; but to bring him into collision with foreign Powers, and to show that he was unable to preserve order, Omar Lufti was employed as an agent of the palace to concoct these massacres!" The note of admiration is mine, for, through personal knowledge of Egypt and its inhabi¬ tants, I recognise in this statement a monstrously improbable charge against the Khedive, the truth or falsehood of which could be best tested, not by Parlia¬ mentary discussion, but by submitting the alleged proofs to the consideration of Lord Granville. In the same speech, referring to the importance of having Ahmed Khandeel's counsel present at his trial in Egypt, Lord Randolph Churchill said : " He was certain the Prime Minister would not lend himself to a foul intrigue of the lowest and most despicable kind on the part of Egyp¬ tians, compared with whom Arabi Pasha was purity itself, for the sacrifice of an innocent man, because he might damage their present position. He asked the Prime Minister to put aside the ordinary traditions of the Foreign Office, which were unfavourable to this man; to look at the matter broadly, and to allow this poor man to have justice done to him, for by so doing he would strengthen the position of the British Government in India." If I understand this language aright, Lord Randolph Churchill solicits the intervention of the Prime Minister to prevent the complicity of the Foreign Office "in a foul intrigue of the lowest and most despic-</page><page sequence="20">20 able kind," involving injustice to a "poor man," to whom the "ordinary traditions " of that great Department of the State are unfavourable ; and the guiding motive which summons Mr. Gladstone to action is not, after all, the simple wish to save the poor victim of official " tra¬ ditions," but the Machiavelian design of enhancing our prestige in India I can, however, myself relieve the apprehensions of Lord Randolph Churchill respecting the traditional ten¬ dencies of the Foreign Office. I was in continuous communication with that Department from 1867 to 1873, both personally and by letter, on a subject connected with Egyptian affairs, and during that period I failed to discover the slightest trace of any esoteric traditions stored in the cerebral convolutions of the permanent staff, which would prevent their doing full justice to the claims of even the meanest Fellah, who now guides the ancient plough of the Pharaohs through the modern alluvia of the Nile. There is, however, a tradition of the Foreign Office, which Lord Randolph Churchill's speech on Egyptian affairs recalls ; it is this—Never wilfully insult a defence¬ less foreign Prince or Power. Now, what is the practical question involved in my review of the speech of Lord Randolph Churchill on the subject of the Affirmation Bill Simply this—Are we merely listening to the personal convictions of the noble member for Woodstock, or do the responsible Chiefs of the Conservative party endorse this policy of reversion to the religious intolerance of past generations Let us seek for an answer in the speeches of eminent members of the Opposition.</page><page sequence="21">21 That distinguished Barrister, Mr. Edward Clarke, the Solicitor-General designate of a Conservative administra¬ tion, exclaims, " They had all heard with admiration the speech of the noble lord, the member for Woodstock. All would acknowledge, after reading that speech, that the Conservative party had fought the fight well. He had only one fault to find with the eloquent peroration of that speech, and that was, that it was not sufficiently hopeful of the future of the Tory party." What are the closing words of Lord Randolph Churchill? "You proudly claim the task of carrying the cause of religious liberty to its furthest imaginable limits. Be it ours, I reply; nor is it less noble, to endeavour to restrain your aspira¬ tion within the bounds of reason and of policy." What is the meaning of these words The Liberal party are the true friends of religious liberty in its most compre¬ hensive sense; the Conservatives are its opponents, unless within the bounds which limit their intelligence and their policy; but all this is practically of no conse¬ quence, because it is an equally noble task to rend or to rivet the fetters of Religious Freedom! Encouraged by the speech of the noble member for Woodstock, Mr. Edward Clarke proceeds to give still further extension to a policy of religious intolerance. "He feared that already the system of education adopted in 1871 had done considerable mischief to the cause of religion. When we blurred and rendered indistinct the hues which defined religious dogma, we went a great way towards weakening the hold of religion on the people; "—but, in that case, was not the Reformation a great national blunder And should we not disavow the perilous apostacy of our Protestant ancestors from</page><page sequence="22">22 the "defined dogmas" of their generation, by seeking restoration to community of faith with the Roman Catholic Church In his loyal allegiance to the orthodox lessons of his youth, Mr. Edward Clarke may be unconscious that many divines of the Anglican Church now languish in spiritual depression under our ancestral heritage of ecclesiastical dogmas and mysteries, and would rejoice could they but see the day of that great Archbishop of Canterbury who, gifted with the genius of a Beaconsfield or a Gladstone, will educate the Church of some future epoch into the final renunciation of all doctrines foreign to the simplicity of the School of Galilee. Turning to the speech of Sir Hardinge Gifford, as re¬ ported in the Times of the 24th of April last, in so far as it gives expression to any general views apart from the individual case of the junior member for Northampton, he apparently holds that, because " Christianity is part of the common law of this kingdom"—which may, how¬ ever, be administered by the lineal descendants of the Sanhedrin who crucified its Founder as an impostor— persons entrusted with any office must pledge themselves to the due performance of the duties of that office, under the solemn and religious sanction of an appeal to a superior Power, who may be, however, a very inferior god, worshipped through the rites of a debased religion, as the only reliable means of testing whether the can¬ didate is possessed of a conscience. In other words, the ferocious cannibal who feasts on the flesh of human victims, but consecrates his banquets by an appeal to a higher Power, however Satanic, through the magic of a talismanic fetich, however barbarous, is more</page><page sequence="23">23 worthy of confiding trust than the enlightened philo¬ sopher who, as the result of scientific research, has lost the faith of his youth in the personality of Divinity. Sir Hardinge Gifford exclaims, with the fervour of conscientious conviction, " This Bill enabled any person, if he preferred it, to make a ' solemn declaration.' What was meant by ' solemn' Did it mean an appeal to a higher Power? ('No.') Then, if not, what was there solemn about it " There is, therefore, nothing solemn in the most impressive scenes of the great Drama of Humanity unless ushered in by a " chorus " of adjura¬ tion ; and when Jesus of Nazareth condemned oaths in the Sermon of the Mount, He deprived that great dis¬ course of the most important element of solemnity "It is true," says Sir Hardinge Gifford, "that you cannot inquire into a man's religion; that is a question between man and his Creator. But the question is, Are you not entitled to ask whether a man has any religious belief at all " I answer, that if it is the duty of the State to restore the Inquisition in the nineteenth century through the interrogation of suspected Atheists or Agnostics, under prospective penalties, not of physical, but of moral torture, and these misguided men are, as affirmed by eminent Conservatives, destitute of even the vestige of a conscience, will they not unscrupulously conceal their unprofitable scepticism and, if elected as members of Parliament, record their claims to orthodox respectability, through an apparently solemn but virtually sacrilegious appeal to some higher Power What, there¬ fore, is the value of a modern Inquisition for excluding conscienceless members from the sacred precincts of St. Stephen's</page><page sequence="24">24 To the speech of Sir Stafford Northcote on the Affirmation Bill, as recorded in the Times of the 4th of May, we all necessarily listen with the respect which the eminent leader of the Conservative party in the House of Commons invariably wins from political friends and opponents. I do not, however, propose to follow the right honourable Baronet into the details of his dis¬ course, for I see that the central figure, around which his ideas are grouped, is that of the junior member for Northampton, and that his attention is absorbed by a " remarkable letter " from some venerable professor in a Mahomedan college in India, who is not, however, himself a votary of the creed of Islam. This gentleman proposes to warn Parliament and the nation against the " serious danger " incurred in their Indian Empire through the " undoubted spreading of Atheism," caused '' by the increased circulation of the works of the Brad- laughites;" and he adds these words of portentous warning, to which Sir Stafford Northcote wishes " to call the particular attention of the House : " " Hitherto the knowledge that the opinions of Mr. Bradlaugh are not those of the people and Parliament of England has undoubtedly acted as a check upon the spread of these pernicious doctrines; but what reasonable man can doubt the terrible effect that will be produced by the news that the House of Commons has now ranged itself on the side of Mr. Bradlaugh " " The House," says Sir Stafford Northeote, " seems surprised at this." Sur¬ prised I should think so ; for if this modern Jeremiah of Hindostan believes in the truths of Christianity, has he so completely lost all faith in their efficacy as to foresee the impending epoch of then- perversion or de-</page><page sequence="25">25 struction in the day which shall witness the entrance of Mr. Bradlaugh into the House of Commons? And if he considers "that among no class of people is the name of God held in greater veneration than among Mahomedans," is he prepared to exclaim, "Behold, a greater than Mahomed is here " * The learned professor entertains admirably liberal sentiments towards devout believers in the Moslem faith. But it may not have occurred to Sir Stafford Northcote, that this comprehensive view of religions, as equally con¬ ducive to piety, provided their votaries reverence the Deity, is damnable heresy, according to the formularies of his Church; f and that those ancestors, for whom he expresses so much admiration in the eloquent peroration of his speech, would have probably consigned to the stake any man guilty of suggesting the possible salvation of a disciple of Mahomed. But the most important part of Sir Stafford North- cote's speech is that in which he briefly defines the Con¬ servative idea of religious liberty. "We have been told," says the right honourable Baronet, "that we should have no religious tests for political purposes. Yes, but that does not mean freedom from religion." In other words, the highest intellects of our age, now occupied with problems, the solution of which will inevitably exercise a most destructive effect on ancestral theologies, * In conversation with a Christian missionary in the scenes of his labours among a Mahomedan population, he informed me that, as he had never succeeded in converting an adult Mussulman, he had directed his attention to establishing schools for children. Would it not, therefore, bo interesting to learn how many converts to Atheism have been secured by Mr. Bradlaugh in India t Article XVIII.</page><page sequence="26">26 * are permitted to attain affirmative, but not negative con¬ clusions—a fallacious conception of freedom, which may be at once exposed by depicting a State governed under conditions of civil liberty so illusory, that its citizens possess freedom of action, but not of inaction—the right of construction, but not of demolition—the privilege of building, but not of omitting to build, so that he, who is destitute of bricks and mortar, must erect " some sort " of structure, or incur social and political obliquy. I therefore inevitably infer, from the speech of Sir Staf¬ ford Northcote, that the Conservative party, controlled by reverence for ancestors who would have consigned a contemporary Darwin to the stake, are the avowed opponents of religious liberty, unless within restrictions virtually irreconcilable with the existence of intellectual freedom. With some exceptions, the Conservative speakers in the affirmation debate lost sight of the good old Eng¬ lish tradition of " fair play," whilst pouring vitriolic streams of vituperation on the devoted head of the junior member for Northampton, who, as stated in his speech at the Bar of the House, was within hearing of all this injurious obloquy, powerless to utter one word in his own defence—conditions of mental suffering which give to the moderation of his speech characteristics of moral and intellectual power, of which their possessor may well feel proud. To my knowledge, I have never seen Mr. Bradlaugh, or read any of his works ; but when he exclaims, " The grave will protect the learned Judge, who tried the case, from the obloquy heaped upon all the Judges who have had the misfortune to do me justice," it seems to me</page><page sequence="27">27 that these are the accents of an honest man. And when he magnanimously declares that neither Mr. Gladstone, nor any member of the Government, or of the Liberal party, had ever granted him any countenance or assist¬ ance in his elections, I find in this pariah of the House of Commons clearer traces of a conscience than are always discoverable in the language, and even in the conduct, of avowedly pious Christians. In fact, if an inhabitant of some other world who had studied our language, our laws, and our religion, during a brief visit to our planet, had been present during all these pro¬ ceedings in the House of Commons, he would probably have exclaimed, with a gesture of amazement towards the Opposition, "Are these the friends, and this" (turn¬ ing towards Mr. Bradlaugh) "the enemy, of Him who preached the Sermon on the Mount " It may not now, perhaps, be found irrelevant to ask and answer the simple question, What is an Atheist The word implies, through its derivation, disbelief in the existence of a God ; but it has been freely applied by pious people, from time immemorial, to those who differed from them in then conceptions of Divinity; and, in this sense, Socrates and Paul were Atheists in the eyes of theological opponents. The modern ideal of an Atheist is, however, a man who has become the enemy of God by denying His existence, with the startling result of forthwith losing all sense of moral obligation. Has any one ever seen this peculiar type of sceptic, who thus simultaneously loses both his creed and his conscience Does his guilt consist in wilfully denying what he really believes In that case, he is not an Atheist, but an impostor. Is he honestly convinced of the non-existence</page><page sequence="28">28 of God Then pious believers should compassionate his spiritual blindness. And if he affirms a negation absolutely unsusceptible of proof, why should men who believe that they possess the evidences of Christianity attach any importance to his teaching " But," exclaims some Conservative member of the House of Commons, " what of the horrors of the French Revolution " I regret I cannot write the history of that great social and political upheaval in half a dozen lines, for then I might disclose, by a brief digression, how small a place was filled by Atheism among the causes which gave to the opening scenes the characteristics of a national tragedy. But I may briefly say, that when men assume the garb of Atheism with the design of appropriating their neighbour's goods, we may rest assured that it is the criminal, not the sceptic, with whom we have to deal—a question of police, not of theology —for none but honest men surrender their ancestral creeds as the result of independent convictions. Again, if we condemn freethought on account of the excesses of the French Revolution, shall we also denounce religion because appalling crimes have been committed in its name Absorbed in terror of a phantasmal Atheism, the Conservative members of the House of Commons have, therefore, apparently spoken in absolute unconsciousness of the enlightened scepticism of their generation. It is now nearly a quarter of a century since Bishop Colenso heroically incurred insult and obloquy, as a "heretic" and "blasphemer," for honestly giving to the world the destructive results of his exhaustive criticism of the</page><page sequence="29">29 Pentateuch. His example was followed by other eminent divines, whose admirable works have assisted laymen in investigating the mysteries of their ancestral faith. In the preface to the third part of his work, Bishop Colenso writes :—" But it is said ' the same spirit of inquiry will be carried into the New Testament.' I answer, undoubtedly it will, and must be; and if there is any part of the Church's teaching depending on the New Testament which will not bear the test of truth, we shall, of course, as servants of the God of truth, be bound to reject that also "—a courageous utterance, which no doubt encouraged a tendency to theological research which, in my case, has, so far, resulted in the conclusions published in " The Evolution of Chris¬ tianity," and in my " Introduction to the Book of Enoch." Eminent divines are still the champions of indepen¬ dent research in theology. Thus, in discussing the diffi¬ culties which surround the Gospel according to St. John, the learned author of the introduction to that evangelist, in Bishop Ellicott's "Commentary," says, "To the author of no English work, published during the present gene¬ ration, will the seekers of truth have more cause to be thankful than to the anonymous author of ' Supernatural Religion,' who has led to inquiry on this subject; " and yet this work has been named in connection with the recent prosecutions for blasphemy! To Mr. Goschen belongs the credit of calling the attention of the House of Commons to the fact that eminent divines of the Church of England would have recorded their votes in favour of the Affirmation Bill.</page><page sequence="30">30 Among those who are acquainted with the results of modern criticism many retain an apologetic faith in the inspiration of Scripture, but to others they carry absolute conviction that we possess no divine revelation in the ancient literature of Judaism or in the primitive records of Christianity. If this scepticism had been attained thirty years ago, we might have turned from the Bible to Paley, to construct a Natural Religion on the basis of providential design in creation. But, in the interval, the Revelations of Science have caused theological con¬ ceptions of personal Divinity to fade in the presence of universal Evolution through the unbroken sequence of natural laws, as potential in the development of solar systems as in the variation of an animal or a plant. Unless, therefore, the Liberal party monopolise the in¬ telligence of the age, there are assuredly men within the Conservative ranks who yield to none in loyalty to the Throne, who admire the House of Lords, and respect the Church of a Stanley or a Tait, and yet, who are so hazy respecting the anthropomorphism of theology that they shrink from muttering an incantation to " some unknown God." The question, therefore, remains for solution, Does the Conservative party desire to exclude these men from the House of Commons Let us, however, hoiDe that the Conservative party will reconsider, in a more liberal and comprehensive spirit, the great question of Religious Liberty. I feel satisfied that if Lord Beaconsfield had been born even ten years later in this century, and were now living, he would advocate the policy of judging all religious questions, not through the prejudices of our ancestors,</page><page sequence="31">K 31 but through the intelligence of our age, and commend the wisdom of granting to all men that fulness of intel¬ lectual freedom which develops the highest forms of civilisation, and fosters the noblest aspirations of mankind. i PRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED, LONDOV AND BEcCLES.</page><page sequence="32"></page></plain_text>
