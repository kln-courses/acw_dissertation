<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pathways, Roadways, and Highways: Networks of Communication and Exchange in Wadi Araba Andrew M. Smith II hen asked what the Romans had done of any benefit for their new subjects, an early-second century CE merchant in the remote port of Aila (Aqaba) on the Red Sea might have responded, "they built the highway, Trajan s via nova/" When the Romans annexed Arabia in 106 CE, they proceeded to develop an infrastructure that would facilitate communication and exchange between the regions various communities and, most importantly, between the numerous military units, the face of the new administration that Rome had dispatched throughout the province. The Romans built roads, a task at which they were exceedingly efficient. But even before the Roman annexation of Arabia and the development of a new highway (the via nova Traiana that connected Syria to the Red Sea), the peoples of pre-Roman Arabia were not lacking in networks of communication and exchange under their Nabataean monarchs.1 Roadways and pathways crisscrossed the landscape and unified the Nabataean kingdom. Today, most of these have disappeared, except in remote areas and ill-preserved sections, which complicates any assessment of where and when the various networks of communication and exchange developed and how they were maintained. Such assessments, nevertheless, are critical to how we view the social history of the region. Especially in a region such as this, social relations among groups who practiced varying forms of economic subsistence were structured and maintained around established networks of communication and exchange. For this reason, the debate about the nature of human traffic in Wadi Araba continues. One side makes the w Satellite view of Wadi Araba showing Dead Sea in the north and the Gulf of Aqaba in the south, image courtesy of NASA. argument that as an expansive, elongated, desert landform that straddles the southern portion of both modern Israel and Jordan, Wadi Araba should be viewed as a barrier to cultural interaction. Yet the Wadi Araba can also be viewed as a natural north-south corridor, an avenue facilitating travel and transport of all sorts. Which perspective to choose? The main question concerns the interconnections between settlements in the north and those in the south and to a far lesser extent, those between settlements east and west. It has been argued, for instance, that while numerous east?west cross^routes existed throughout the valley, no north-south routes were ever sustained for long periods (e.g., Rothenberg 1971: 211-23). Such arguments, however, do not examine fully the broad range of settlement activity in the valley (inclusive of bedouin populations) in relation to the types of routes that were developed and maintained in specific ecological contexts.

Note the long shadows the steep mountains to the east cast across the valley. Image courtesy of NASA. activity in the classical periods?because this corresponds to the hinterland of Roman Aqaba (Aila)?can inform this argument and demonstrate that north-south routes did indeed exist. Assessment includes focusing, in terms of ecological context, on placement and alignment of pathways, roadways and highways that connected major and minor settlements to one another on both sides of the valley; elaborating on interconnections between various types of settlements; and showing how ecological factors determined both the nature of settlement activity and the types and placement of communication and exchange networks in the valley. Indeed, far from being a barrier to cultural interaction, the Araba facilitated communication and exchange. Wadi Araba is the section of the Jordan Rift valley that stretches from the Gulf of Aqaba for approximately 165 kilometers north to the southern Ghor of the Dead Sea. To the east and west of Wadi Araba, the land rises steeply to high plateaus with eastern altitudes averaging eight hundred meters above sea level. The loftiest peaks are in the southeast, which are of bold relief and rise up to fifteen hundred meters above sea level. The width of the valley ranges from eight to thirty kilometers. Wadi Araba is a typical desert environment. The climate is arid (Evenari et al. 1982: 59-75). Rain occurs infrequently and only during the winter months. Throughout the valley, the average annual rainfall is less than thirty to fifty millimeters. Mean temperatures range from a daily minimum of 10?C (50?F) in the winter to 40?C (104?F) in the summer. Also, water resources are scarce. A few perennial springs dot the eastern and western fringes of the valley, but groundwater is usually attained through wells excavated at varying depths (see below). Flora and fauna adapted to desert conditions flourish in Wadi Araba, though endangered species struggle to survive, except where reserves have been established for their protection. The desert environment appears also to have shaped the valley's human ecology (Horowitz 2001: 616-26). Pastoralism, for example, is the primary economic base in most areas, as opposed to farming. As the archaeological evidence suggests, this would seem to have been the case from the Neolithic period onward (Smith et al. 1997: 45-71).

Landforms A closer look at ecological context, highlighting a few predominant geophysical variations of the landscape, gives us a clearer picture of settlement activity and the types and placement of communication and exchange networks in the valley. In the south, alluvial fans are the predominate landforms (Ginat et al. 1998: 151-60; Cooke and Warren 1973: 173-87). These are fan-shaped washes of alluvium (soil, stone, and other sediments) that radiate along the mountain range where the tributary valleys empty into the expansive Araba depression. On the ground, they appear as large boulder fields, primarily across their mid-sections. For the most part, these fan complexes deter human traffic, particularly north south movement across active drainages. Less effort may be expended crossing these fans along their lower reaches, where the detritus is finer and comprised of fewer boulders, or along the base of the escarpment, where one may avoid the boulder fields and negotiate only the crossing of the mouths of the various wadis. These wadis are essentially valleys that are dry through most of the year except during heavy rains. When flooding occurs, the subsequent discharge of sediments into the Araba is the mechanism by which alluvial fans develop. One of the largest of the alluvial fans in the southeast Araba is that of Wadi Muhtadi, which stretches deep into Wadi Araba. Fans with more gradual slopes over greater distances, such as that of Wadi el-Yutm, appear as alluvial plains. These seem not to impede human traffic, except when one is trying to travel through active drainage flows and so through less compacted alluvial debris. Large sabkhas, or mudflats, also characterize the southern and central Araba. These vast areas are flat, very saline, and consist of sand or silt lying just above the water table. Lack of sufficient drainage facilitates their development, because trapped water evaporates in the upper subsurface, leaving behind deposits of salts and other minerals, thereby creating a hard impermeable surface. Dafiya (or Evrona), Taba, and Qa'a es-Sayidiyeen are the principal sabkhas in the Araba. Except when these are flooded, which is only for brief periods during the winter, the sabkhas facilitate traffic of all sorts because their hard and relatively smooth surfaces make them easy to traverse. Settlement activity, however, is largely restricted to the perimeter of these sabhkas, where the soils are less saline and potable water is available, whether taken from wells or natural springs. The prominent oasis of Yotvata, for instance, lies at the northwest edge of the Taba sabhka (Abed 2002: 83 97). The sabhka of Qa'a es-Sayidiyeen, however, is exceptional. Because of its setting nearer to the watershed of the valley, which results in increased drainage, its alluvial soils tend to be less saline and more fertile for crop production. Between Qa'a es-Sayidiyeen and the Taba sabhkay other unique landforms include sand dunes and sand fields (Saqqa and Atallah 2004: 63-87). The notion that these are impassable is a popular one, though inaccurate. The sand dunes themselves may be snaked around with little difficulty, either on foot or with pack animals. Only wheeled transport would prove problematic, especially through sand fields. In order to facilitate travel or transport through sandy areas, roads would be required. And in just such areas roads have been discovered. To the north of Qa'a es-Sayidiyeen, the valley fans out and its topography is interspersed with sand fields, gravel plains (hammadas), and boulder fields. Sand fields impede movement of all sorts, especially wheeled transport, except in areas where pathways or roadways have been developed. Likewise, boulder fields, which in the north lack the steep gradient of those in the south, are no less difficult to cross. Occasional paths may be cut through the boulder fields, by clearing a swath and depositing the debris on either side of the path or roadway. This practice, in fact, may have been more common than now appears. Often such clearings deceptively appear as drainage channels and may be overlooked easily. The gravel plains in the north, in contrast to the sand and boulder fields, are great facilitators of travel and transport, because they provide natural surfaces that substitute for any developed, paved road system. Thus, the south and central sectors of Wadi Araba exhibit a variety of landforms, each of which must be negotiated differently in the development of any network of 182 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 68:4 (2005)</page><page sequence="4">SHMllE^5ay|B?jBM ? - ,.4.. , ,;^ .... ? ::; / / ; ? *. ; :.: *'. , - .TSstS?S^Xj/%V"' ""' -&lt; .' -t"-..-; * /"'-o?-:;?XXffi:- -" ^ S|(i|BgllW Sand dune field looking northwest (south of Gharandal). Photograph by the author. communication and exchange. Seemingly, in relation to human traffic, these landforms provoke natural responses, as people are apt to follow paths of least resistance. In other words, why cross a boulder field when one may, with far less effort and without making a significant detour, bypass it? Natural Resources In addition to landforms, the presence of natural resources is another ecological factor that affects both the nature of settlement activity and human traffic in the valley. Due to the arid environment, water is the most important. Springs exist at Evrona, Yotvata, Gharandal, et Tayyiba, and Rahel. In other areas, the ground water is sufficiently high to allow for the excavation of shallow wells for access, such as along the shoreline of the Gulf of Aqaba, along the edges of the sabhkas, and in the beds of many of the wadis that empty into the valley (Horowitz 2001: 103). Deeper wells also tap the groundwater, such as at Be'er Menuha and Bir Madhkur. Also, systems of wells, or qannats, are attested in the areas of Yotvata and Evrona, though these may be Islamic in date (Lightfoot 1997: 432-51). Wadi Araba is also rich in mineral resources. The exploitation of its copper reserves has been studied extensively (see most recently Levy et al. 2002). In the early Roman period, limestone was also mined for building purposes in the area of Jebel Khureij (Smith et al. 1997: 52). For ceramic and glass production, the area to the east of Aqaba is rich in feldspar, and traces of glass sand, a type of sand suitable for glass production because of its high silica content, have been found from the area of Wadi es-Siq down to Aqaba (Ibrahim 1993: 65; Saqqa and Atallah 2004: 83-84). Occurrences of gold are also attested in the hills to the northwest of Eilat and in the Araba southwest of Petra, Roadway or linear clearing along alluvial fan (east of al-Risha). Photograph by the author. though exploitation of these reserves seems to date to the early Islamic periods (Gilat et al. 1993; Amar 1997). Additional resources in Wadi Araba include its flora and fauna (Hart 1885: 250-64; Zohary 1944; Zohary and Orshan 1956: 15-37). Tamarisks, acacias, and a variety of desert shrubs provided fuel for domestic or industrial use, such as that needed to sustain copper smelting (Engel 1992). These also provided fodder for area wildlife, which included gazelles, ibex, foxes, and various other species. Furthermore, because the vegetation is abundant and water accessible, herds of camel, sheep, and goat, which support the human population, flourish in the valley. To sum up, Wadi Araba abounds in natural resources. In fact, no part of the valley is without some exploitable resource. Since people are drawn naturally to resources, it follows that there was human activity, in one form or another, in most every part of the valley. Indeed, networks of communication and exchange provided an integrative framework for settlement activity in Wadi Araba. For human settlement of any type in Wadi Araba, the primary requirements are food and water. The natural NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 68:4 (2005) 183</page><page sequence="5">mmmr A herd of camels grazing on fodder southwest of Bir Madhkur. Photograph by the author. environment favors an economy based on pastoralism. Bedouin today, perhaps no less than in antiquity, herd sheep, goats, and camels in every sector of the valley, as already noted. They also hunt wildlife, an activity vividly depicted in the ancient rock art from various sectors of the valley. Where water is more plentiful, settlement activity intensifies. Oases, the most prominent being Aqaba (Aila) in the south, Yotvata, and Gharandal, are known for permanent settlement, where a variety of crops are grown including dates. Agriculture, that which involves irrigation especially, is an important marker of extended and organized settlement activity. In the central Araba, from Qa'a es-Sayidiyeen northward, agriculture is viable primarily because of the increased rainfall and human willingness and effort to exploit the surface runoff. Seemingly, this was the case during the Nabataean and Roman periods, as my own work at Bir Madhkur suggests. Indeed, some of the grain produced in the central Araba in the Roman period was probably transported to Aila in the south, which seems never to have had a self-sustaining agricultural regime. Nevertheless, while the inhabitants of Roman Aila would have imported grain, the city was not without food. Fish, caught in abundance, were a primary export and their remains have been found at numerous sites in the valley and at Petra (Parker 1998: 390 91; 2000: 379-80). Two points must be emphasized. First, while food and water are requirements for settlement, the former existed more or less in abundance throughout the valley whether in the form of livestock or agricultural produce while the latter, because it is more limited in supply, seems to have dictated permanency of settlement in any given area. Second, settlement activity in Wadi Araba, whatever the mode of economic subsistence, seems to have been governed by the availability of resources, and many of the pathways and roadways, as well as serving as avenues of communication, seem connected to the exploitation of these resources and their distribution. Until recently, a lack of archaeological surveys for most of Wadi Araba has made it difficult to assess its settlement history, especially in the classical period, and by extension, the region's road system, which would have connected these settlements has also been difficult to reconstruct. Indeed, since the pioneering explorations of Nelson Glueck (1935) and Fritz Frank (1935), knowledge of only a few key sites has shaped our understanding of settlement patterns in the valley. Most of these sites are set near water resources or along known routes. They are, in fact, substantive and prominent features of the landscape, which has expedited their discovery and repeated documentation. Yotvata, Gharandal, and Bir Madhkur, each with major Roman Project map of some of the'sites documented during the 2003 season of the Bir Madhkur Project. Note the land route west of Khirbet Umm Quhntera, which appears as a light linear band crossing the hammada plain.

In discussions of how such sites interrelate, we tend to speak in terms of trade routes and trade patterns. As well, since most of these sites seem defensive in nature, we tend to emphasize their military aspects (e.g., Alt 1935), downplaying how these sites functioned in civilian capacities, as centers, for instance, of local administration. Unfortunately, few of these sites have been surveyed with the goal of documenting and analyzing archaeological remains in their territories, each in a different ecological context. Thus, the less obtrusive sites such as campsites, animal pens, stone rings, or cairns, knowledge of which would enhance our understanding of human activity in the Araba, remain poorly represented. Even the more substantive remains of agricultural exploitation in the central Araba have not been studied in any detail. The example that follows sheds light on how such studies will radically expand and alter our understanding of the valley. Bir Madhkur: A Case Study As a case study to examine the settlement history of Wadi Araba in terms of the social and economic relationships between the various groups active in the valley, indigenous and otherwise, I initiated the Bir Madhkur Project.2 Bir Madhkur is a principal way station and military outpost in the foothills of Wadi Araba roughly one hundred kilometers north of Aqaba and eleven kilometers northwest of Petra along the Petra-Gaza trade route. The site was occupied between the Nabataean and Byzantine periods. The features of the site, which include a Roman fort, a domestic settlement, and perhaps a bath, in addition to the types of sites in the vicinity of Bir Madhkur, which range from farmhouses to campsites, suggest a non-indigenous presence, integrated with the regional environment and mixed with indigenous peoples. In November 2003, I focused on documenting agricultural activity outside and around the site. I visited areas where the remains of terraces, field walls, and water channels were Rock art depiction of a hunting scene from a Roman period campsite north of Gharandal.

Preliminary reconnaissance to assess agricultural activity in the area shows a significant pastoral presence as well, with archaeological sites ranging from encampments and corrals to stone circles, isolated graves, and cemeteries. Most of these sites are difficult to date, but analogous evidence has been documented in the valley further south by the Southeast Araba Archaeological Survey under the aegis of the Roman Aqaba Project (Smith et al. 1997). One encampment in Wadi Museimir, for example, dates to the Roman period and incorporates numerous stones with graffiti and pictograms inscribed on them?the latter provide a vivid depiction of some of the activities of the rural population and the exploitation of regional fauna. Close proximity of many of these sites to administrative centers such as Bir Madhkur, Gharandal, or Yotvata, or to rural areas of intensive agricultural production may indicate symbiotic economic and social relations, perhaps associated with resource acquisition and distribution. I also began to study the pathways and roadways that linked all these sites in the region of Bir Madhkur into a single broad network. One of my goals remains to elucidate the regional patterns of communication and trade. For example, I aim to elaborate upon the routes that linked Bir Madhkur to Petra, Gaza, and Aqaba, as well as the local networks that linked Bir Madhkur to the less obtrusive pastoral sites just discussed. This study so far has revealed a significant number of pathways that criss-crossed the valley in every direction, including north south routes. In some areas, only a single path traversed the landscape. Camel tracks, for example, are numerous. In other areas, multiple paths aligned to indicate prominent routes. Along one such route, for example, I discovered a caravanserai, NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 68:4 (2005) 185</page><page sequence="7">which local bedouin identify as Khirbet Umm-Quhntera, with evidence of occupation from the Nabataean to Late Roman period. Occasionally, the routes narrow to well delineated roads. One such ancient route leads northwest from Bir Madhkur, which complements roads leading west and southwest of the site. The primary difficulty in assessing this evidence is a general inability to provide dates for the development or use of pathways or roadways. Some may be modern, some are ancient. The best we can achieve is the discovery of sites that may be associated with these various routes to suggest periods of use. Khirbet Umm Quhntera is one example, and various other structures have been identified as support facilities or road stations. Ultimately, the project revealed a complex network of pathways and roadways in this sector of the valley that projected in every direction from Bir Madhkur and integrated the settlement with the rural landscape. Assessing the connection between roadways and pathways at Bir Madhkur and elsewhere made it clearer that most routes evolve as organic features of the landscape dictated by the physical ecology and related to the requirements of their users. Paved roads, for instance, seem only to be necessary (though perhaps not exclusively so) in sand districts and their use somewhat limited to wheeled transport (perhaps of supply or trade goods). The Southeast Araba Archaeological Survey discovered one such paved road in the sand districts south and northwest of Gharandal. Along gravel plains and in sabhkas, however, the surface is a natural pavement that requires little effort to make passable. In rocky plains, roads often appear as broad linear swathes cleared of stones. Indeed, this diversity in road types, even along vast stretches of a single roadway, makes their overall assessment difficult. Furthermore, the numerous cross-paths created by donkeys and camels, the preferred modes of transportation in this region, especially among pastoralists, reveal how entire districts may be considered interconnected as a single avenue of communication and exchange. As this one case study clearly shows, with respect to the debate regarding route alignments in Wadi Araba, connections between ^jjj^^^yi^HI^^^HKil^^Vs^ ...**,* -. y* Satellite view of Wadi Araba showing major sites and landforms. Image courtesy of NASA. settlements in the north of the valley with those in the south are indeed evident. The Historical and Archaeological Periods Looking at historical and archaeological sources, while taking into account the valley's ecology, allows theoretical reconstruction of communication networks, especially those for trade and transport. For routes north of Aqaba, a single Roman highway, the via nova Traiana, descended the eastern mountain range through Wadi el-Yutm, as the ancient Peutinger Table arguably depicts. Though no traces of the via nova have been found near Aqaba, its development in the early second century is well documented (Graf 1995). According to inscribed milestones from along its route, the via nova extended "from the limits of Syria to the Red Sea" (a finibus Syriae usque ad mare rubrum). Interestingly, for the portion of the Peutinger Table depicting routes in the southern Araba, an error seems apparent. The road from Aqaba (identified as Haila) is not shown as immediately ascending Wadi el-Yutm en route to Praesidio (abbreviated Psidio), which may be identified with the Roman fort of Khirbet al-Kh?lde, and then to Hauarra, or modern Humeima (Bowersock 1973: 173). Instead, the enigmatic Ad Dianam intervenes, depicted in the Peutinger Table with the vignette of a temple. What this means is not clear. The map as it exists today is a thirteenth-century copy, so perhaps the copyist erred in this section by not drawing a direct connection from Haila to Praesidio (Aharoni 1954: 16) Alternately, perhaps there are no errors and the route Haila Ad Dianam-Praesidio actually denotes an ancient roadway, but not necessarily the via nova Traiana. One possibility would be the track from Khirbet al-Kh?lde to the road station of Rujm Maqrah Hadid in Wadi Araba through Wadi Muhtadi. From Rujm Maqrah Hadid the route would have forked and continued either south to Aqaba or north to Yotvata. Interestingly, the distance between Rujm Maqrah Hadid and Aqaba corresponds closely to sixteen Roman miles or twenty-four kilometers, just as noted in the Peutinger Table.3 Meanwhile, in all likelihood, 186 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 68:4 (2005)</page><page sequence="8">the via nova itself stretched from Khirbet al-Kh?lde to Aqaba through Wadi el-Yutm, as the various towers and road stations along the route would seem to confirm (Graf 1995). Immediately north of Aqaba, the route through Wadi Araba may have followed the line of the via nova before bifurcating and continuing along the edge of the Dafiya sabkha toward the spring and well of Evrona and then to Horvat Dafit. This route would have Camel track in the Araba southwest of Bir Madhkur (view northwest). Such tracks criss-cross the hammada plains and remain prominent land routes. Photograph by the author. Road in Wadi Araba leading norhwest of Bir Madhkur. This is a viable candidate for the well-known land route between Petra and Gaza. Photograph by the author. continued northward following the lower edge of the alluvial fan of Wadi Muhtadi and passing Rujm Maqrah Hadid, where it may have met the east-west land route depicted in the Peutinger Table as mentioned above. Upon reaching the Taba sabkha, one route continued north to Yotvata, the base of a Roman garrison, while another probably crossed the valley in a northeasterly direction toward the Nabataean settlement of Rujm Taba, then to the oasis of Gharandal, the site of another Roman garrison (Avner, Davies, and Magness 2004:405-12; Smith et al. 1997: 59-60). Sections of a north-south road have been recorded in the sand district south and north of Gharandal, the latter aligned in the direction of Khirbet es-Sayidiyeen (Smith et al. 1997: 59-60). In the western Araba about fifteen kilometers north of Yotvata, three groups of sandstone milestones, all of the late-third and early-fourth century CE, have been found at roughly 1.5 kilometer intervals distance from one another (Avner and Roll 1997: 135). These may indicate another cross-route that would have connected Yotvata with Gharandal. Alternately, the road may have continued north and joined with other recorded roads (Avner 1997: 133-34; Aharoni 1963: 30-42). North of Qa'a es-Sayidiyeen, one leaves the sand districts and enters the hammada plains where the gravel surface substitutes for pavement. Multiple routes then proceeded northward, which appear in aerial photographs as at least fourteen light linear bands crossing the dark hammada plains. One such route passed the road station of Khirbet Umm Quhntera. Finally, in addition to this north-south traffic, east-west roads or routes abounded. Wherever a major wadi debouched into the Araba, through which one might either enter or exit the valley, cross routes potentially existed, either established as roads or paths. The latter were more frequented by pastoralists, who, in their seasonal migrations between the valley and the plateau, sought out water resources and vegetation as fodder for their herds. Interestingly, towers near the entrance to many wadi systems (at Wadi el-Yutm and Wadi Muhtadi, for example) may have monitored such transient movement in and out or across the valley. At other major wadi systems, whether those that were easily navigable between the Araba and the eastern and western plateaus or those ^Mm^ _ft*r.- -J* giftig _ *-*.. .

These major sites also supported transient activity of a different sort. Traders, whose business it was to cross the valley en route from one emporium to the next, would have utilized the facilities at these sites and at other road stations, where they would also have registered their goods and paid the necessary duties. In the south, the city of Aila was a nexus of various trade routes, and in the north, the most popular ancient route connected Petra with Gaza, presumably through Bir Madhkur. In fact, I have identified a new, potential section of this prominent route northwest of Bir Madhkur. Archaeological evidence from sites along its path, including new evidence from Bir Madhkur and its environs, suggest that the Petra-Gaza road grew in significance under the Nabataeans, who first equipped it with road stations. Use of this route seems to have continued throughout the Roman period (Cohen 1982). Summary The settlement history of Wadi Araba and its networks of communication and exchange may be more complex than at first assumed. There were, in fact, extensive connections between a range of settlement types in the Araba, both large and small, via a variety of types of routes. Many are not the commonly paved constructions of the Romans, but informal pathways or roadways, perhaps of Nabataean origin or earlier, that often supported more local and regional traffic. Indeed, between prominent settlements where resources are abundant or exploitable (especially water) and pastoral sites in the countryside ran an array of pathways and roadways that interconnected them all. Most of the analogous evidence discussed for these routes is of the Nabataean and Roman periods, with a handful Byzantine. More intensive survey and excavation should refine our data and enhance our understanding of the settlement history of Wadi Road in sand district of Wadi Araba northwest Gharandal (view northwest).

It suffices now to regard the Araba neither as a divide preventing social contact nor a barrier to cultural interaction. Rather, via a network of land routes, the peoples of Wadi Araba and of the regions bordering the valley, indigenous or otherwise, were clearly interconnected. Notes 1. I delivered an early draft of this paper in Atlanta, Georgia at the conference entitled, "Crossing the Rift: Resources, Routes, Settlement Patterns and Interaction in the Wadi Arabah," a pre-session of the 2003 Annual Meeting of the American Schools of Oriental Research. This research is an extension of my web-based project (http://waarp.tripod.com) on Wadi Araba developed in 1996, which provides a forum for synthesizing current knowledge of the Araba's physical and cultural landscape. My goal remains to examine Wadi Araba as a whole integrating the archaeological landscapes of the Negev and southern Jordan, not bounded by its current position as a divide between nations. Since its conception in 1996, the Wadi Araba Archaeological Research Project also supports fieldwork to fill gaps in our knowledge of the antiquities of the valley, which includes the Bir Madhkur Project and the Central Araba Archaeological Survey. I thank Elise A. Friedland for discussing this material with me at length and for reading early drafts of this paper. I finalized the manuscript while in residence at the American Center of Oriental Research in Amman, Jordan, as an affiliated scholar, and while at the W. F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research in Jerusalem, as an Educational and Cultural Affairs Fellow (2004-2005). 2. Smith (2005). Though my focus here is on the classical periods, one may, I suspect, conjecture that, under comparable socio-political circumstances, similar situations existed in other periods as well, given the relationships as I have described them between the region's physical ecology and the types of routes and their placement. 3.1 thank Dr. Fawwaz al-Khraysheh, Director-General of the Department of Antiquities of Jordan for his support and approval of this project and its long-term goals. I want also to thank Dr. Pierre M. Bikai, Director of the American Center of Oriental Research (ACOR) for years of constant support and encouragement for my work in Wadi Araba. The field season in 2003 was funded through an Explorers Club (Washington Society) Field Research Grant. 4. This suggestion clearly raises a new line of inquiry regarding the correspondence between routes and road stations in the region with those depicted in the Peutinger Table, a study that I am currently pursuing. 188 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 68:4 (2005)</page><page sequence="10">References Abed, A.
