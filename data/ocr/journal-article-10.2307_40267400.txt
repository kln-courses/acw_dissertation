Ontos Verlag, Frankfurt a. M., 2006, cloth, 551 pp, EUR 129.00, ISBN 3-938793-09-0 Sven Ove Hansson Published online: 22 October 2008 © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008 In 1936 Alonzo Church, Emil Post and Alan Turing, independently and almost simultaneously, proposed a precise mathematical definition of the intuitive notion of computability. Several generalized methods for computation, among them Turing machines, turned out to be equivalent, and it was postulated that they correspond exactly to what a computing agent acting mechanically is able to compute (or rather: would be able to compute in unlimited finite time if provided with unlimited memory). This postulate is now called "Church's Thesis" or the "Church-Turing thesis". Its philosophical impact can hardly be underestimated. It has given us new perspectives on the philosophy of mathematics, the philosophy of mind, and computer science. It also has thoroughgoing implications for the philosophy of the natural sciences, in particular physics. Olszewski, Wolenski, and Janusz have collected an impressive set of papers that cover a wide array of topics related to Church's thesis. The quality is mostly high, and controversial issues are treated fairly, with contributions representing different views on the controversy. Unfortunately, the value of this collection is depreciated by the editors' decision to publish the papers in alphabetical order of author names. There is no means for readers to orient themselves in the book: It contains no introductory essay that briefly summarizes the contributions or groups them according to topic. Only five of the 22 essays carry an abstract. The titles of the papers give some guidance, but some of them have uninformative titles such as "Turing's thesis" and "Thesis and variations". The book does not even have a subject index (only a name index). There is no easy way for the reader to locate the essays that treat a topic in which she is particularly interested. A reader who wants to read the whole book finds herself in essentially the same situation as a PhD student who receives a pile of 22 S. O.

Hansson copies of journal articles from her professor, with no direction on which papers to read first or which to read together. This lack of organization and guidance is particularly disconcerting when contributions refer to each other. About halfway into Copeland's chapter the reader will realize that the rest of this chapter is largely a reply to Hodges' s paper in the same volume, which she should therefore have read before Copeland. Hodges' s paper ends with a short rejoinder to Copeland. The obvious order of this interesting debate would have been Hodges 1-Copeland-Hodges 2. Instead, due to alphabetical contingencies, it is Copeland- two unrelated papers - Hodges 1 and Hodges 2. In this review I will try to guide readers of the book by presenting its contents in a systematic order. Needless to say, this is a service to readers that should have been done by the editors, either in an introductory essay or by ordering the contributions thematically, or preferably by both means. A certain duplication of introductory material is unavoidable in an anthology that covers controversial issues that different authors may wish to introduce in different ways. However, the book contains a hidden gem in the form of the first sixteen pages of Carol E. Cleland's essay ("The Church-Turing Thesis. A Last Vestige of a Failed Mathematical Program"). This is an excellent introductory text, summarizing in an easily accessible way the background in the history of mathematics and mathematical logic that one needs in order to understand the controversies surrounding Church's Thesis. This text should have been separated from the second part of her contribution (and preferably supplemented with an equally pedagogical text on the thesis itself) and used as an introduction. Several of the essays have their main focus on the history of the thesis. Wilfried Sieg ("Step by Recursive Step: Church's Analysis of Effective Calculability") contributes a scholarly account of the development of Church's ideas, making use of letters and manuscripts from the formative years. This essay is an excellent background for Adam Olszewski's in-depth investigation of what Church meant by the thesis. ("Church's Thesis as Formulated by Church - An Interpretation") David Turner's essay ("Church's Thesis and Functional Programming") is devoted to Church's and Kleene's lambda calculus and its relation to programming. As Turner rightly notes, the lambda calculus, in terms of which Church first developed his thesis, "has influenced almost every aspect of the development of programming and programming languages" (p. 539). Piergiordio Odifreddi has contributed an essay on Kreisel's view on the thesis ("Kreisel's Church") and Oron Shagrir one on Gôdel's view on the thesis and on the notion of computability ("Gôdel on Turing on Computability"). The historical coverage would have been even better if the book had contained papers focused on the views of Church's two co-discoverers of the thesis, Turing and Post. (Copeland discusses some aspects of Turing's views at some length, but his focus is not historical.) Basic conceptual and definitional issues are treated in several excellent essays. Roman Murawski and Jan Wolenski ("The Status of Church's Thesis") discuss the status of the thesis: Is it an empirical hypothesis, a natural law, an axiom, a theorem, a definition, or an explication? Leon Horsten ("Formalizing Church's Thesis") investigates whether the thesis can be formally expressed in an intuitionistic â Springer</page><page sequence="3">Book Review 423 framework or in epistemic mathematics (roughly, Peano arithmetic extended with an S4 modal operator representing reflexive provability). Charles McCarty ("Thesis and Variations") discusses modal aspects of the thesis: what does it mean that a function is computable! In doing this, he also provides an acute formulation of the trivialization problem in the definition of computation. "For the calculator on my desk, and for any triple &lt;m,n,p&gt; of natural numbers, there is some possible world or other in which the calculator, perhaps supplied with extra working memory and input-output ability, would take represented m and n as inputs and output a standard representative of p. By reasoning in this fashion, one can conclude that all functions are computable by any input-output device, anything to which inputs and outputs are assigned - and that is anything whatsoever" (pp. 284-285). In the second part of the essay mentioned above, Carol E. Cleland discusses the idealization underlying Turing machines. Turing, in her view, embraced a "highly anthropomorphic view of computation" (p. 141). Human beings performing calculations with pencil and paper may not be a good model of the capacities of physical devices that compute. We know that physical constructions are known to accomplish many things that unaided human beings cannot achieve. Whether physical processes can hypercompute, i.e. compute Turing uncomputable functions "ultimately depends upon the causal (versus formal) structure of the world" (p. 144). Andreas Blass and Yuri Gurevich ("Algorithms: A Quest for Absolute Definitions") discuss the notion of an algorithm, Stanislaw Krajewski ("Remarks on Church's Thesis and Gôdel's Theorem") explores the relationship between Church's thesis and Gôdel's theorems, and Douglas S. Bridges ("Church's Thesis and Bishop's Constructivism") relates the thesis to mathematical constructivism. One of the major contested issues concerning Church's thesis is its provability or refutability. The standard view is that being a formal explication of an informal concept, it cannot be proved or disproved in the mathematical sense. However, contrary views have been heard, claiming either that the thesis can be proved or that it can be disproved. The most well-known defector from the received view is Elliott Mendelson who claimed in 1990 that the thesis is susceptible to rigorous mathematical proof. ("Second Thoughts about Church's Thesis and Mathematical Proofs", Journal of Philosophy 87:225-233.) Readers interested in the provability issue are well advised to begin by reading Stuart Shapiro's essay ("Computability, Proof, and Open-Texture"). Shapiro puts the purported provability of Church's thesis in the right context by comparing it to other mathematical postulates that identify an intuitive, pre-theoretical notion with a notion that is more precisely defined. Some examples of such notions are those of a continuous function, the area under a curve, and a knot (in topology). He might also have mentioned the concept of a set and that of a proof. The explication of a vague, pre-theoretical idea in terms of a more precise concept cannot be proved or refuted. However, some such explications have become generally accepted, and are now considered by mathematicians as the natural sharpening of the informal concept. Shapiro claims that this development has taken place for Church's thesis. Elliott Mendelson contributes a short text ("On the Impossibility of Proving the 'Hard-Half of Church's Thesis") in which he challenges the view that there is a £} Springer</page><page sequence="4">424 S. O. Hansson barrier between informal and formal mathematical notions that cannot be bridged by rigorous proofs. Janet Folina ("Church's Thesis and the Variety of Mathematical Justifications") discusses how the distinction between different concepts of mathematical proof (or mathematical justification) affect discussions of Church's thesis. She also provides a critical discussion of Mendelson's proof of the thesis. Selmer Bringsjord and Konstantine Arkoudas ("On the Provability, Veracity, and AI-Relevance of the Church-Turing Thesis") begin their contribution by jointly criticizing Mendelson's proof. After that the two authors take turns at presenting arguments for and against the thesis. It is difficult to distinguish the parts of the paper that represent Bringsjord's views, Arkoudas's views, respectively the joint views of both authors. This paper should have been split into chapters satisfying the standard editorial requirement that the author name(s) at the head of a chapter correctly report the authorship of the chapter as a whole. According to the physical interpretation of Church's thesis, a function is effectively computable by a physical system if and only if it is Turing machine computable. The term hypercomputation is standardly used for a physical computation that transcends the limitations of Church's thesis. Hypercomputation is currently a fashionable subject, and the number of proposed methods and mechanisms for hypercomputation is rapidly increasing. Readers interested in the physical Church-Turing thesis are advised to begin by reading Hartmut Fitz's unusually insightful overview of the topic ("Church's Thesis and Physical Computation"). His focus is on the fundamental conceptual issues of computation. He begins by paying close attention to the notion of implementation, and asks "exactly what it means for a physical system to implement a computation" (p. 181). This is a crucial issue that has not been sufficiently considered in previous literature. Possibly the most valuable feature of this essay is its discussion of the threatening trivialization of the notion of physical computation. If any represen- tation of inputs and outputs is allowed, then any predictable physical input-output system with sufficient variability can be trivially interpreted as computing any mathematical function. Therefore, computation cannot be an intrinsic property of physical systems. Instead, it must be interpreted as depending on our system of representation. It follows that the physical Church-Turing thesis "is a claim about the limits to our methodology of ascribing computational content to physical systems, and no longer a claim about the limits of computation simpliciter" (p. 206). Then "the scope of physical computation will be delimited by those input-output relations between measurable quantities which are observationally accessible and experimentally determinable" (p. 208). Based on this, Fitz questions whether the physical Church-Turing thesis is an empirical statement at all. In his view it is not a statement about objective properties of natural phenomena but "merely a mode of description for their behavior and therefore essentially dependent on and constrained by human epistemic procedures" (pp. 210-211). B. Jack Copeland ("Turing's Thesis") discusses various types of hypercompu- tation. He claims that both Church and Turing referred to computation by human computers, not by machines. Andrew Hodges ("Did Church and Turing Have a Thesis about Machines?") argues to the contrary that both Church and Turing alluded to computation by a physical device (machine). The central issue in this £) Springer</page><page sequence="5">Book Review 425 debate is whether the physical Church-Turing thesis has an historical precedent. However, historical precedence should not be confused with philosophical pre- eminence. Jerzy Mycka ("Analog Computation and Church's Thesis") provides a valuable overview of analog computation and is relation to the physical Church-Turing thesis. Another paper on physical computation, by Karl Svozil ("Physics and Metaphysics Look at Computation"), pays particular attention to computation by quantum-mechanical means. The aspects of Church's thesis that relate to philosophy of mind and artificial intelligence are less extensively covered in the book. Several contributions, including those by Copeland and by Bringsjord and Arkoudas, deal with issues of this nature, but the only chapter that focuses undividedly on them is that by Darren Abramson ("Church's Thesis and Philosophy of Mind"). The central issue in Abramson's chapter is whether humans hypercompute. The contributions to this anthology clearly show that computability and its limits is a rich subject that ramifies into a number of foundational issues both in mathematics and the empirical sciences. Some authors wish to exclude issues of physical computation from this discussion, claiming that Church's thesis solely concerns what a human being can do in a precisely defined, step-by-step procedure, and has nothing to do with physical machinery. However, the terminological issue ("What does 'Church's thesis' really mean?") can only be a side issue. Human computation and physical computation are intricately connected in at least two ways: As humans we are subject to the same fundamental limitations (often expressed as natural laws) that restrict what a physical device can do. And a physical device can only be used for calculation if it is humanly possible to make the inputs and interpret the outputs. In the philosophy of computation, age-old questions of the relation between us humans, the universe, and our (mathematical) thought constructions reappear in new and more revealing guise. £) Springer</page></plain_text>
