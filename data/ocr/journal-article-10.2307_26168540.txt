To this end, I address a body of litera- ture broadly termed ‘posthumanist’ because it offers powerful tools to identify and critique dualist  constructions of nature and culture that work to uphold Eurocentric knowledge and the colonial  present.1 Geographers have taken up posthumanist approaches in various ways, producing a sig- nificant body of work that contests dualist ontologies in Anglo/European political philosophy by  showing how a multiplicity of beings cast as human and nonhuman – people, plants, animals, ener- gies, technological objects – participate in the coproduction of socio-political collectives.2 In so  doing, geographers also point to the epistemological, political, and ethical limitations of on-going  Corresponding author: Juanita Sundberg, Department of Geography, University of British Columbia, 1984 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2,  Canada.

As Ruth Panelli suggests, posthumanist  geographies are tightly bound in and by Eurocentric scholarship and, Annette Watson and Orville  H. Huntington argue, tend to ‘glorify “modern” science and technology,’ thereby privileging ‘only  certain human–nonhuman assemblages.’4 In what follows, I build from my discomfort to elaborate  a critique of geographical-posthumanist engagements. Taking direction from Indigenous and deco- lonial theorizing, I begin the paper by identifying two Eurocentric performances common in post- humanist geographies and analyzing their implications. In so doing, I critically reflect on my own  recent use of posthumanist theories while also addressing other recently published texts. I then  conclude with some thoughts about ways to decolonize geo-graphs. I offer this critique to share  ideas that may resonate with others, so together we may work through ontological questions that  are integral to political goals held in common. Before turning to my argument, I define several terms used throughout. I use the term ‘posthu- manism’ to signal a diverse body of work rooted in Anglo-European political philosophy that  refuses to treat the human as 1) an ontological given, the privileged if not the only actor of conse- quence and, 2) disembodied and autonomous, separate from the world of nature and animality.5 I  use ‘Eurocentrism’ when referring to a contingent conceptual apparatus that frames Europe as the  primary architect of world history and bearer of universal values, reason, and theory.6 The term  Anglo-European includes English-speaking white supremacist settler societies as bearers of these  Eurocentric imaginaries.7 Because of my location as citizen of one white supremacist settler soci- ety (the United States of America) and resident of another (Canada), I primarily address relations  between Anglo-Eurocentrism and Indigenous theorizing; however, I hope the thoughts offered here  will be of relevance to other geopolitical contexts. Following Shaw, Herman and Dobbs, I use the word ‘Indigenous’ to refer to groups with ances- tral ties/claims to particular lands prior to colonization by outside powers and ‘whose nations  remain submerged within the states created by those powers.’8 In referring to Eurocentric and  Indigenous epistemes throughout, I recognize the risk of positing a sharp division between them.  This is not my goal; I join Watson and Huntington in recognizing on-going epistemic interactions  across time and space while acknowledging the existence and particularities of Indigenous episte- mologies.9 I maintain an analytical separation between posthumanist theory and Indigenous epis- temes even as there may be overlapping themes and goals. By ‘decolonizing,’ I mean exposing the ontological violence authorized by Eurocentric episte- mologies both in scholarship and everyday life.10 As an inhabitant of a white supremacist settler  society, I have a profound obligation and responsibility to confront the widespread implications of  colonialism in my scholarship and to ask what (geographical) thought has to become to face the  political, philosophical, and ethical challenges of decolonizing.11 This is especially the case in rela- tion to thinking about the land and how human societies interact with those cast as nonhuman.12 Decolonizing also involves fostering ‘multiepistemic literacy,’ a term proposed by Sami scholar  Rauna Kuokkanen to indicate learning and dialogue between epistemic worlds.13 Dialogue  ‘between a diversity of epistemic/ethical/political approaches,’ or epistemic worlds, works to enact  a ‘pluriversal world’:14 a world in which many worlds fit, a vision put forward by the Zapatista  movement in Mexico.15 The Zapatistas (Zapatista Army of National Liberation) emerged on the  world scene in 1994, and have put forward a significant body of knowledge rooted in the political  analysis, ontologies, and everyday experiences of various Maya communities in Chiapas, Mexico.  </page> <page sequence="3"> Sundberg 35 This work, collected and disseminated in a variety of ways, has had a tremendous influence on  global organizing against neoliberalism and solidarity practice as well as political theory.16 In my  conclusion, I take up learnings offered by the Zapatistas as steps on a path to decolonizing. My goal  is to foster geographical engagements open to conversing with and walking alongside other epis- temic worlds. Posthumanist performances I have embraced posthumanism because it helps me address the methodological challenge of  accounting for nonhumans as political actors in (geo)political processes. As I noted in a recent  paper, this (by no means cohesive) body of work advances relational ontological approaches,  which treat ‘the human and nonhuman as mutually constituted in and through social relations.’17  For instance, Haraway’s Companion Species Manifesto calls for and enacts storytelling that empha- sizes ‘co-habitation, co-evolution, and embodied cross-species sociality’ between humans and  domesticated animals such as dogs.18 I, like many geographers interested in confronting the disci- pline’s on-going struggles with epistemologies of segmentation, have been drawn to posthumanist  theories.19 Moreover, Indigenous scholars increasingly challenge Anglo-European geography to  evaluate and transform our disciplinary habits, especially in relation to ontologies of the human  and nonhuman.20 Despite my enthusiasm, I am concerned that posthumanist theory remains within the orbit of  Eurocentered epistemologies and ontologies. Indeed, the literature continuously refers to a founda- tional ontological split between nature and culture as if it is universal. Jay Johnson and Brian  Murton refer to this split as a meta-narrative rooted in Enlightenment thinking and globalized  through colonial discursive practices.21 While Anglo-European thought does not comprise a coher- ent body of work, and dualist constructions are continuously examined and challenged, my point  is that this literature repeatedly references such dualisms as if they are universal foundations of  thought, which only serves to perpetuate their presumed universality. Even as I have grappled with these ideas, I initially did not question the implications of consult- ing scholarship rooted in Eurocentric thinking in order to address methodological challenges stem- ming from Eurocentric meta-narratives and dualist ontologies. Why did I not seek out scholarship  rooted in non-dualistic epistemic traditions? Indigenous authors in the Americas, for instance, out- line complex knowledge systems wherein animals, plants, and spirits are understood as beings who  participate in the everyday practices that bring worlds into being.22 These epistemic traditions are  not organized in and through dualist ontologies of nature/culture. Does it not seem obvious to con- sult such work in order to think through methodological difficulties that stem from trying to under- stand and depict co-production from within a body of thought that tends to purification and  segmentation? This paper is part of my process of addressing these questions, becoming accountable for my  epistemological and ontological habits, and advocating institutional change as steps towards decol- onizing geography. As a first step, I identify two performances enacted in posthumanist theories  that work to constitute posthumanist geographies as Eurocentric: silence about location and silence  about Indigenous epistemes. Although I treat these performances separately for heuristic purposes,  they are interconnected and mutually constituting. The notion of performance allows me to high- light how worlds are brought into being through enactments of everyday discursive practices regu- lated by social norms.23 As David Turnbull suggests, ‘Knowledge is performative. In the act of  producing knowledge, we create space.’24 We also fashion ourselves as subjects. What kind of  spaces are posthumanist geographies creating? And, what kinds of subjects? </page> <page sequence="4"> 36 cultural geographies 21(1) Performance #1 Posthumanist thought tends to be silent about its ‘loci of enunciation,’ a term offered by Walter  Mignolo to address the ‘geohistorical and bio-graphic’ location of authors as well as bodies of  thought.25 Locating the self is a tactic common to feminist methodologies to acknowledge that  knowledge comes from somewhere and is, therefore, bound up in power relations. In Indigenous  methodologies, situating self in relation to community affiliation and place accounts for the impor- tance of place in knowledge production and avoids essentialist conceptions of a pan-Indigenous  epistemology.26 However, this practice is uncommon in posthumanist theorizing. For example, in What is  Posthumanism? Cary Wolfe analyzes various strands of posthumanist thinking in relation to  ‘the fundamental anthropological dogma’ of Enlightenment humanism, which holds that the  figure of the human is achieved by transcending materiality and especially animality (empha- sis in original).27 Wolfe’s analysis, however, enacts its own universalizing performances in  that he does not explicitly identify the loci of enunciation of such dogmas. Indeed, Wolfe is  silent about the fact that Enlightenment humanist dogmas represent a particular, indeed pro- vincial, body of thought on the question of the human. Thus, he does not mention that such  dogmas originated in European societies involved in colonization, were globalized in and  through colonial practices, and are currently given life in white supremacist settler societies.28  Along these lines, Wolfe makes no mention of past and present knowledge systems founded in  non-dualist thinking. Consequently, Wolfe universalizes Enlightenment humanist dogmas and  participates in on-going colonial practices that eliminate or erase other ontological frame- works in other knowledge systems. With few exceptions, posthumanist geographies repeat this performance.29 For example, in  a recently published paper specifically engaging posthumanist methodologies, I situate my  efforts to address nonhumans as political actors in the United States-Mexico borderlands in  relation to a contained and self-referential circle of Anglo-Eurocentered thinkers, although I  did not make a statement to that effect nor explain why this was so.30 Nor do I mention that  the ‘more-than-human’ methodologies currently elaborated in posthumanist geographies are  but one approach in a world of inclusive or non-dualist frameworks, such as those articu- lated by Indigenous scholars.31 Neither the reviewers nor the editor called me on my  Anglo-Eurocentrism. To give another example, I turn to Bruce Braun and Sarah Whatmore’s edited volume Political  Matter.32 In the introduction, the authors pose the book’s central question: ‘What if we took the  stuff of politics seriously’? Who constitutes this ‘we’ is never located. Instead, the coordinates of  this particular ‘we’ are to be found in relation to the geopolitical location of the sources cited and  examples given, which are all Anglo-European. Further along, Braun and Whatmore highlight  what they term the ‘stubborn attachment of many scholars – liberal and radical alike – to a human- ism that finds ever new ways of positing the nonhuman “out there”.’33 The authors do not qualify  who these scholars may be. Consequently, this stubborn attachment is called into being as a univer- sal phenomenon. In sum, silence about location is a significant performance that enacts Eurocentric theory as  universal, the only body of knowledge that matters. In the following section, I discuss another  dimension of this silence, and that is the overwhelming silence about Indigenous scholarship,  which articulates non-dualist frameworks. However, as I illustrate, this silence tends to be comple- mented by very particular and circumscribed references to Indigeneity. Taken together, these  maneuvers perpetuate colonial violences. </page> <page sequence="5"> Sundberg 37 Performance #2 Johnson and Murton, Panelli and others have commented on geography’s lack of engagement with  Indigenous ontologies as well as research by Indigenous scholars, including in geographies of  nature.34 Kuokkanen frames the absence of engagement with Indigenous epistemes as a form of  sanctioned ‘epistemic ignorance’ that enables ‘the ongoing exclusion of other than dominant  Western epistemic and intellectual traditions.’35 As noted above, my own recently published work further sanctioned this ignorance. For another  example, I again turn to Braun and Whatmore’s introduction in Political Matter. According to the  authors, the book aims to sketch out ‘a more fully materialist theory of politics’ by bringing sci- ence, technology, and society studies together with political theory.36 Never mentioned are the  many Indigenous epistemes that take the material world very seriously in constituting political  ontologies.37 Instead, Braun and Whatmore’s approach is sketched out solely in relation to Anglo- Eurocentered thinkers. The habitual exclusion of Indigenous scholarship, however, is accompanied by very particular  references to Indigeneity. This move is enacted in Braun and Whatmore’s introductory comments  about the ways in which (unnamed) political theorists populate the polis solely with human beings.  In political theory, the authors state, ‘The idea that “things” might condition political life is seen to  return us to a primitive state, attributing magical qualities to inanimate objects.’38 While critical of  political theory, this statement does not specify who constitutes ‘us,’ nor do Braun and Whatmore  provide any discussion to contextualize which political theorists they are referencing or what, pre- cisely, they mean to say by mentioning the primitive. I suggest the primitive’s appearance in this  sentence calls forth but also upholds Eurocentric and colonial imaginaries that constitute European  Selves as civilized in relation to primitive Others through binaries such as political theory/primi- tive religion and rational/magical.39 Even so, in the sentence that follows, Braun and Whatmore  state: ‘Despite this, we believe that modern political theory provides many openings to imagine the  matter of politics differently.’40 The question of how theoretical work underpinned by dualist, colo- nial imaginaries is going to constitute different political imaginings – and for who – is not addressed. The enactment of a rational Self in relation to the magical, primitive Other is evident in Jane  Bennett’s chapter as well. Bennett’s goal is to ‘highlight the active role of nonhuman materials in  public life,’ to ‘give voice to a thing power,’ or the vitality and capacity of things to produce effects  that exceed human intentionality.41 Her tale of plastic gloves, dead rats, and oak pollen seeks to  demonstrate the intimate connections between people and material objects so as to foster different  ethical and political relations. The chapter’s final section, entitled ‘The Naive Ambition of Vital  Materialism,’ calls upon ‘modern, secular, well-educated humans’ to allow for ‘moments of meth- odological naivete.’42 By this, Bennett means humans ought to postpone the tendency to interpret  thing power solely in relation to human agency so as to linger, to ‘cultivate the ability to discern  nonhuman vitality, to become perceptually open to it.’43 Further on, however, Bennett expresses an  anxiety that fostering vital materialism via the ‘capacity for naiveté’ risks – and here she cites  W.J.T. Mitchell – ‘the taint of superstition, animism, vitalism, anthropomorphism, and other pre- modern attitudes.’44 Even as Bennett advocates attention to the power of things, she worries that  taking such things seriously risks tainting the rationality of secular humans with the stain of ‘pre- modern’ magic. In order to avoid this risk, while still attending to materialism, Bennett engages  what she terms a ‘rich archive in Euro-American political theory.’ In calling forth imaginaries of modern, well-educated Selves and naive, superstitious Others,  Bennett enacts colonial gestures of superiority that cast others outside the sphere of intellect and  knowledge production. This is also to say that Bennett’s text calls forth the non-modern Other as  </page> <page sequence="6"> 38 cultural geographies 21(1) capable of giving ‘things’ their due as co-producers of daily life, but incapable of producing  knowledge relevant to theorizing materialism. Ultimately, Bennett’s chapter is underpinned by and  enacts an anxious Eurocentric and humanist framing of the human as modern, rational, autono- mous, and nature transcendent; carefully kept outside the category of the human are those classi- fied as superstitious animists. To summarize, the performances identified here – silence (about location as well as existing  Indigenous or ‘non-western’ scholarship) coupled with very particular ways of summoning  Indigeneity – are power-laden. Such performances are governed by and ultimately uphold what  Bruno Latour calls the modern constitution (with ‘Modernity’ implicitly and sometimes explicitly  marked as a Eurocentric myth). Central to the modern constitution are two Great Divides, the  Internal and the External.45 To paraphrase, Latour argues that the modern practice of separating  nature from culture is foundational to dividing ‘us’ from ‘them,’ moderns from primitives: ‘We’  moderns set ourselves apart from ‘them’ because ‘we’ see ourselves as capable of distinguishing  between nature and culture, science and society while ‘they’ remain mired in nature.46 In the texts  analyzed here, divisions between us and them are called forth in relation to a nature/culture binary  in terms of capacity to produce legitimate, modern (as opposed to magical and pre-modern) knowl- edge about the political significance and vitality of nonhumans. As a consequence of such practices, Anglo-European scholarship is the only tradition truly alive  in posthumanist theorizing. Here, I use the word alive in the sense put forward by Dipesh  Chakrabarty in Provincializing Europe.47 Chakrabarty argues that western scholarship treats think- ers who are long dead (e.g. John Locke, Karl Marx, Max Weber) as intellectual contemporaries  without historicizing them or placing their conceptual frameworks in their European (and colonial)  intellectual contexts. In contrast, scholars from other intellectual traditions – he refers to Sanskrit,  Persian, or Arabic – are treated as truly dead, material for either historical or ethnographic research  only. As a consequence, Chakrabarty contends, epistemologies or ontologies embedded in other  worlds are not alive to us as resources for critical thought today.48 Ultimately, the exclusive focus on Anglo-European thinkers in posthumanist theorizing enacts  the world as universe, meaning the ontological assumption of a singular reality or nature, about  which different cultures offer distinct interpretations. For Blaser, the notion of universe equates  ontology with culture and supports the anthropological claim that different perspectives on the  world may be understood through and reduced to Eurocentric categories.49 As Latour delineates,  the modern constitution frames the true nature of reality as discernable by and through western  science; from this perspective, ‘culture is negotiable whereas the environment is not.’50 Following  Blaser, I suggest that the assumption of a universe is inherently colonial, in that it ‘sustains itself  through performances that tend to suppress and or contain the enactment of other possible worlds.’51  Radical alterity is contained and reduced to sameness. Scholars identified with the modernity/coloniality framework offer the concept of the pluriverse  as a strategy for moving away from the universalizing and colonizing notion of the universe.52 For  Blaser, the pluriverse entails imagining the performative enactment of multiple, distinct ontologies  or worlds, which ‘bring themselves into being and sustain themselves even as they interact, inter- fere, and mingle with each other’ under asymmetrical circumstances.53 As outlined in the next  section, enacting the pluriverse is a crucial goal of decolonizing geographical engagements. Decolonizing posthumanist geographies In this section, I compliment the critique outlined above by proposing three steps towards decolo- nizing geographical engagements with posthumanism. My goal is to offer bodies of thought and  </page> <page sequence="7"> Sundberg 39 practice that support the broader political and intellectual projects of posthumanist scholarship,  which I interpret to mean advancing methodological approaches that demonstrate the ways in  which sociality is co-produced by a multiplicity of entities. To this end, I primarily build on con- ceptualizations of walking the world into being offered by the Zapatistas. An ‘insurgent political  imagination,’ Zapatismo has been a significant source of inspiration, learning, and transformation  for me as well as others.54 I begin with a brief outline of walking, followed by a more precise dis- cussion of how the Zapatista movement theorizes walking as an important practice in building the  pluriverse, a world in which many worlds fit. In building on ideas of walking worlds into being,  my intention is not to enact a linear or prescriptive imaginary; paths meander, intersect, circle  around, fade away, and begin again. Finally, in what follows, I use the term ‘we’ as an invocation  and invitation to the reader – who, given the demographics of the discipline, is most likely white – to  walk, ask, listen, and converse. Walking is identified as an important practice in the performative coproduction of knowledge  and space.55 ‘We make our world in the process of moving through and knowing it.’56 Indeed, as  research in Indigenous American communities illustrates, trails, paths, and tracks mark and bring  into being important cognitive connections and social interactions.57 Moreover, as David Turnbull  points out, trail walking is intertwined with storytelling, narratives that call forth and enact connec- tions between people, place, and practices in time and space.58 I posit walking as key to decolonizing in order to highlight the importance of taking steps –  moving, engaging, reflecting – to enact decolonizing practices, understanding that decolonization  is something to be aspired to and enacted rather than a state of being that may be claimed.59 In  addition, attention to walking – the embodied and emplaced movements involved in producing  worlds – may help to foster recognition of the multiplicity of knowledge systems. As we humans  move, work, play, and narrate with a multiplicity of beings in place, we enact historically contin- gent and radically distinct worlds/ontologies.60 The Zapatista movement advances a performative notion of walking in relation to social trans- formation. For instance, at the 1996 Encounter for Humanity and Against Neoliberalism in Chiapas,  Subcomandante Marcos’ welcome address stated: ‘We brought forth the war in the year zero and  we began to walk this path that has brought us to your hearts and today brings you to ours.’61 Here,  Marcos is suggesting that the Zapatista movement is enacted through walking; the journey is the  destination, and the world is brought into being through everyday praxis. Walking also is embodied  in the principle of ‘preguntando caminamos’ or ‘asking we walk,’ which suggests that the move- ment is enacted through a dialogic politics of walking and talking, doing and reflecting.62 In other  words, the path to social change must be walked and talked. Building on this concept, I suggest a first step to decolonizing posthumanist engagements in  geography: locating our body-knowledge in relation to the existing paths we know and walk.  Gayatri Spivak uses the term homework to describe the activity involved in identifying the coordi- nates of one’s location.63 For Spivak, homework entails a self-reflexive analysis of one’s own  epistemological and ontological assumptions; in other words, examining how these have been  naturalized in and through geopolitical and institutional power relations/practices. Doing home- work is a key practice in unlearning that which one has learned; unlearning privilege, especially  the privilege of sanctioned ignorance that allows the perpetuation of silence about on-going colo- nial violence. For non-Indigenous inhabitants of white supremacist settler societies like the US and Canada,  homework may involve learning about ‘the colonizer who lurks within.’64 In the discipline of  geography, this process entails analyzing the coloniality of power, knowledge and being, meaning  ‘long-standing patterns of power that emerged as a result of colonialism, but that define culture,  </page> <page sequence="8"> 40 cultural geographies 21(1) labor, intersubjective relations, and knowledge production beyond the strict limits of colonial  administrations.’65 Coloniality is enacted in the discipline of geography in multiple ways, such as  knowledge production that has contributed to the surveillance and dispossession of Indigenous  peoples.66 As a case in point, I note Cole Harris’ critical reflections on the ways in which settler  assumptions informed a paper he published in 1985, entitled ‘Industry and the Good Life around  Idaho Peak.’ In a 1996 republication of the paper, Harris writes: ‘my proposition that no Native  people had ever lived near Idaho Peak is absurd, and grows out of the common assumption, with  which I grew up, that a mining rush had been superimposed on wilderness.’67 The concept of wil- derness has and continues to play a significant role in the erasure of Indigenous epistemologies.68  While geographers have contributed to historicizing and locating the wilderness concept, few have  initiated sustained engagements with Indigenous (and other non-western) epistemologies, ontolo- gies, and methodologies.69 As a consequence, Anglo-Eurocentric concepts retain their place as the  only ones that matter in posthumanist thought. In short, homework starts from where we are but the goal is to move beyond identity politics to  take responsibility for the epistemological and ontological worlds we enact through the paths we  walk and talk. Along these lines, doing homework may create the conditions for transformation by  allowing ourselves to ‘go out of our minds,’ Johannes Fabian’s term for ‘leaving one’s comfortable  psychological, political, and discursive place’ to engage others.70 Building on the idea of leaving  one’s comfort zone, I turn to step two. Step two builds on the concept of walking with, put forth by the Zapatistas in the 2005 Sixth  Declaration of the Selva Lacandona as an invitation to others to walk with the Zapatistas.71 The  concept has (at least) two meanings. In one sense, walking with means ‘reciprocal respect for the  autonomy and independence of organizations’ involved in the struggle; in other words, respect for  the multiplicity of life worlds.72 Step two, then, involves learning to learn about multiplicity.  Kuokkanen emphasizes the difference between learning to know the other and learning as an  engagement with the other (that also may entail learning from the other). For Kuokkanen, the ‘will  to know implies an enclosure, a hegemonic monologue, and the colonial logic of domination.’73  Hence, Kuokkanen cautions against the multiculturalist approach to learning, as in appreciating the  other’s difference; ultimately, this framework serves to uphold the universality of Eurocentric  knowledge. Instead, Kuokkanen calls for learning as ‘participatory reciprocity,’ which frames  knowledge as a social activity and entails learning to perceive and receive Indigenous epistemes as  part of the geopolitical present.74 For geographers intent on enacting the political and intellectual objectives of posthumanist  theorizing, walking with entails serious engagement with Indigenous epistemologies, ontologies,  and methodologies. Doing so in a humble manner that treats Indigenous people as political  subjects – rather than objects of research – entails following Indigenous protocols, principles, and  methodologies.75 While the specifics may vary, Indigenous protocols and methodologies pose  challenges to western research practices and institutional expectations in multiple ways, especially  the importance placed on co-developing research agendas designed to ‘recognise the struggles of  Indigenous peoples to preserve and further their knowledges and the affirmation of their rights to  sovereignty over political, economic and cultural resources.’76 Watson and Huntington offer an inspiring example of walking with.77 In an innovative, co- authored paper, Watson (a non-Indigenous academic geographer) and Huntington (an Athabascan  hunter and gatherer) describe Koyukon hunting practices to demonstrate how Indigenous intellec- tual traditions may ‘productively contribute to discussions of the ethical and political implications  of posthumanism.’78 The paper treats Koyukon knowledge as ‘equal to that of Western science’  without subsuming its spiritual and ethical dimensions.79 The authors accomplish these goals by  </page> <page sequence="9"> Sundberg 41 co-narrating their movements and conversations through the physical and epistemic spaces shared  during a moose hunt. In engagements such as this, walking and learning are crucial to developing  the ‘multiepistemic literacy’ so crucial to pursuing the stated political goals of posthumanist  thought.80 The principle of walking with also redefines solidarity: in the Sixth Declaration, walking with  the Zapatistas is framed as engaging in activism wherever one is living in support of a common  struggle against neoliberalism and for democracy, liberty, and justice. Hence, step three entails  walking with in the sense of political engagement. I think of walking with as a form of solidarity  built on reciprocity and mutuality, walking and listening, talking and doing. Walking with entails  engagement with Indigenous communities and individuals as intellectual and political subjects,  colleagues in the practices of producing worlds. How one engages will take a variety of forms and  will be different for everyone. Engagement may involve a commitment to including Indigenous scholarship on knowledge  systems, political theory, and sociality in research and teaching practices.81 Taking this work seri- ously is a vital step in enacting the world as pluriversal and fostering different ways of thinking  about and interacting with those cast as nonhuman. This mode of engagement is particularly impor- tant for those of us committed to posthumanist political objectives, such as forging methodologies  to study how socio-political collectives come into being in ways that address the many beings  involved in such co-productions. Engagement also may involve direct collaboration with Indigenous groups as allies in pursuit  of political goals shared in common. Such collaborations, for instance, may work towards decolo- nizing the university by featuring Indigenous conceptions of human-animal relations, as have  Watson and Huntington, while also transforming knowledge production practices by writing in a  style that represents multiple locations and experiences. Decolonizing also is the aim of (non- Aboriginal academics) Kate Lloyd, Sarah Wright and Sandie Suchet-Pearson’s collaboration with  four generations of Yolngu women from northern Australia. Inspired by the relational ontology  enacted by Yolngu, the authors include Bawaka Country as co-author; at Bawaka, the authors  write, ‘non-humans – landscapes, seascapes, animals, winds, sun, moon, tides and spirits such as  Bayini, a spirit woman of Bawaka – constantly shape and influence our research collaboration.’82  While research collaborations such as theirs are co-organized to co-produce knowledge useful to  fostering Indigenous self-determination, walking with may entail stepping away from research  projects if and when the researcher’s goals do not line up with community interests, capacity, or  political goals.83 Finally, walking with also may entail taking direct action. For instance, in Canada, the Idle No  More movement calls upon all people ‘to join in a revolution which honors and fulfills Indigenous  sovereignty which protects the land and water.’84 The movement began as a grassroots effort by  First Nations ‘to educate First Nations people on the multitude of legislation put forward by the  Harper government that they feel is a direct attack on the rights of First Nations.’85 In a series of  actions across the country, First Nations have called upon non-Indigenous allies to stand with them  in solidarity.86 Putting our bodies on the line, when invited, enacts the world as pluriverse by standing  for Indigenous ways of being in the world. In sum, locating the self, learning to learn, and walking with are steps towards enacting ways of  being in the world that advance posthumanist politics as well as broader goals of decolonizing the  discipline of geography. Steps such as these entail recognizing the asymmetrical histories that  sanction ignorance and erasure as well as adopting protocols for fostering dialogue and solidarity.  For instance, Lloyd, Wright and Suchet-Pearson describe how enacting Indigenous research proto- cols led to centering Indigenous ontologies in all aspects of the collaborative project, which, in  </page> <page sequence="10"> 42 cultural geographies 21(1) turn, entailed radically reframing academic practices by calling forth academic subjects as rela- tional and accountable rather than individuals and enact research as a ‘more-than-human event.’87 Concluding comments This paper stems from my worries about the tendency in posthumanist theorizing to treat Anglo- European theory as the only body of work relevant to ontological questions about nature and cul- ture. As outlined here, I am concerned about the ways in which posthumanist texts enact  universalizing claims and, as a consequence, reproduce colonial ways of knowing and being by  further subordinating other ontologies. Inspired by Indigenous and decolonial theorizing, I put  forward steps for decolonizing geographical engagements with posthumanist thinking. To chip  away at the veneer of universality enacted in posthumanist knowledge performances, I suggest  locating theoretical approaches in biographic, historical, and geopolitical terms and marking as  provincial what is otherwise naturalized as universal. In addition, I explore various dimensions of  walking with as strategies to transform the spaces and subjects fashioned in and through knowledge  production practices by fostering ‘multiepistemic literacy’ and political engagement. Ultimately, decolonizing posthumanist geographies implies making political choices about the  worlds we wish to enact, choices for some ways of living together over others. Although decoloniz- ing demands political choices, it is not an individual act; as both posthumanist and Indigenous  theorizing suggest, we take steps and chart new paths in relation to and alongside a multiplicity of  beings at all times. The exciting and challenging task ahead involves walking and talking the world  into being as pluriversal. A world in which the multiplicity of living beings and objects are  addressed as peers in constituting knowledges and worlds.

As noted below, I use the term posthumanism to signal a diverse body of work by authors who may or  may not identify with the label. On the relationship between dualist constructions of nature and culture  and colonialism, see Val Plumwood, Feminism &amp; the Mastery of Nature (New York: Routledge, 1993).  On the colonial present, see B. Willems-Braun, ‘Buried Epistemologies: The Politics of Nature in (Post) colonial British Columbia’, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 87, 1997, pp. 3–31.  2.

Wolfe, What is Posthuman- ism? (Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 2010); B. Braun, ‘Modalities of Posthumanism’,  Environment and Planning A, 36, 2004, pp. 1352−5; N. Castree and C. Nash, ‘Posthuman Geographies’,  Social &amp; Cultural Geography, 7(4), 2006, pp. 501−4. My own approach is primarily influenced by K.  Anderson, Race and the Crisis of Humanism (New York: Routledge, 2007); K. Barad, ‘Posthumanist  Performativity: Toward an Understanding of How Matter Comes to Matter’, Signs: Journal of Women  in Culture and Society, 28(3), 2003, pp. 801−31; D.

I agree with Lawrence Berg that the term ‘white supremacist’ is more accurate to describe ‘present con- ditions in white settler societies like Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the USA as well as former  European imperial powers like Germany, the UK, and Spain’, L. Berg, ‘Geographies of Identity I: Geog- raphy – (Neo)liberalism – White Supremacy’, Progress in Human Geography, 36, 2012, pp. 508−17. In  making this argument, Berg is drawing on bell hooks as well as The Companion to African-American  Philosophy. Broadly speaking, the term implies a social system in which whites have overwhelming  control over power and resources.  8. W.S. Shaw, R.D.K. Herman and G.R.

Kuokkanen, Reshaping the University, p. 57. Kuokkanen draws on Foucault in her understanding of  episteme to mean ‘a lens through which we perceive the world; we use it to structure the statements that  count as knowledge in a particular period.’  14.

The same may be said about Isabelle Stengers’ contribution, which is based on the premise that ‘we  may have to face the eventual demands of beings that were comfortably put away as creatures of human  imagination,’ such as goddesses, dijinns, and spirits. In calling forth a ‘we’ who do not believe in god- desses, the chapter implicitly alludes to a ‘them’ who do; I.

The movement was sparked by legislation put forward by the Harper government that will unilaterally –  without consultation and consent – alter sections of the Indian Act and disregard treaties signed with First  Nations. In addition, Omnibus Bill C-45 will affect the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and the  Navigable Water Protection Act and, therefore, will potentially affect all inhabitants of the nation-state.  87.
