<plain_text><page sequence="1">GRETA L. LAFLEUR University of Hawai 'i at Manoa Precipitous Sensations Herman Mann's The Female Review (1797), Botanical Sexuality, and the Challenge of Queer Historiography In 1800, printers in both New York and London released a "re published" edition of The Unsex'd Females, a political tract by Richard Pol whele, a London curate. Published anonymously in 1798, Polwhele's ex tremely popular poem was a vitriolic attack on Jacobin gender politics, reserving the largest part of its ire for one of the most notable "unsex'd females" of the decade, Mary Wollstonecraft. Historians and literary crit ics of Jacobin and anti-Jacobin politics alike have explored at great length the relationship between The Unsex'd Females and the essay to which it, in large part, responds: Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792). Often overlooked, however, is that both the form and the content of Polwhele's poetic diatribe also parodically address another con troversial and quite popular piece of literature from the 1790s: Erasmus Darwin's Loves of the Plants (1789), an epic poem based on Linnaean tax onomy that described the sex lives of plants in pornographic detail. To Polwhele, Wollstonecraft's radical feminist politics and Darwin's lavishly copulating flora both reflected the same social ill: the violation of "NATURE'S law" (7) of feminine modesty. Though Wollstonecraft's work became culturally associated with sexual lasciviousness due to popu lar knowledge of her many romantic affairs, Polwhele's anxiety about the sexual implications of the rise of popular interest in botany was derived from the science itself. Because of the 1735 publication of Carl Linnaeus's Systema Naturae, which introduced a "sexual system" of taxonomy that identified plants by the presence or absence of their reproductive organs, botany emerged as a sexual science, and cultural practices of plant ex change, dissection, and illustration exploded among the middle class and the wealthy.1 If we keep this in mind, Polwhele's critique of radical femi {93</page><page sequence="2">94 I EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 48, NUMBER 1 nism takes new shape when we consider his complaint that female mod esty was imperiled by Wollstonecraft's call for women's education. The American edition of The Unsex'd Females is permeated with assertions of his haughty disapproval of women practicing botanical science in the name of education. Describing a botany class, he writes that young female students With bliss botanic as their bosoms heave, Still pluck forbidden fruit, with mother Eve, For puberty in sighing florets pant, Or point the prostitution of a plant; Dissect its organ of unhallow'd lust, And fondly gaze the titillating dust. (10-11) This series oflusty images—heaving bosoms, "forbidden fruit," "pant[ing]," "prostitution," and the plant's "organ of unhallow'd lust"—render Pol whele's tract perhaps more pornographic than even Loves of the Plants, the poem it satirizes. In the American edition, Polwhele footnotes this passage, explaining that "botany has lately become a fashionable amusement with the ladies. But how the study of the sexual system of plants can accord with female modesty, I am not able to comprehend." In a somewhat voyeuristic validation of this claim, he also notes that, "I have, several times, seen boys and girls botanizing together" (nio). Polwhele's disgust at coeducational "botanizing" clearly demonstrates that the implicit sexuality of botanical taxonomy also spurred an explicit cultural awareness of botany as not only a science of sex but also an outlet for human sexual practice.2 This essay takes the transatlantic interest in popular botany as a point of departure in its examination of alternative sites for the study of Ameri can sexuality before the rise of formal sexology.3 Focusing on the American interest in the "sexual system" of popular botany in the wake of the Revo lutionary War, I turn to a lesser known "unsex'd female" of the 1790s, con sidering the historical problem posed by Deborah Sampson, the real-life, cross-dressing, "lesbian-like" protagonist of Herman Mann's 7he Female Review; or, Memoirs of an American Young Lady (1797). Mann's relatively obscure novel describes both the military and the romantic exploits of his unconventional hero(ine), at times going into explicit yet extremely con fusing detail concerning the nature of Sampson's relationships to her "sis ter sex."4 The Female Review is permeated by representations of relation</page><page sequence="3">Precipitous Sensations {95 ships that clearly appear queer—and thus require apology, explanation, or defense—to Mann, as well as to the readers who he understands to be his audience, and importantly, these moments are almost entirely described within a botanical idiom. In The Female Review, Mann's depictions of Deborah Sampson clearly belie his suspicion that there is something funda mentally different about his protagonist, and Mann charts this difference in naturalist terms, describing her as "singular," "rare," and "miraculous," yet always still "natural" (225). My reading of Mann's The Female Review brings the natural imagery of the narration back into critical focus, especially in light of its historical context, as a vocabulary with which Mann was highly familiar, and as a trope within writing that resonates with developments in popular botany and sexual science at the end of the eighteenth century.5 Because of the fact that botany relies on a specialized form of the cate gorization of knowledge—Linnaean taxonomy, widely considered the "sexual system" of taxonomy—popular botany expanded the possibilities for knowledge of biological difference within human sexual behavior. Most historians of science understand Linnaeus's taxonomy to have effected a widespread shift in cultural perceptions of the meaning of gender, but over look the changes that the popularization of Linnaean taxonomy wrought within American cultural understandings of sexual behavior. In the after math of the publication of Loves of the Plants, sexual behavior newly ap peared as an object of scientific inquiry, and different forms of sexual be havior were understood to bear a fundamental or essential relationship to the nature or character of the plant. But what of a case like Sampson's, in which her observable sexual dif ferences were read as sexual characteristics, but characteristics for which there was not yet a vocabulary or taxonomy? Sampson's aberrant gender and sexual behaviors must also be considered alongside the "second side of the taxonomic project: the search for new specimens" (Hallock 698). The constant possibility of the new specimen allowed for the belief in a form of knowledge that was actually a nonknowledge, in which scientists both an ticipated and actively sought out "specimens" or forms of life with which they were unfamiliar. This rage for the undiscovered should be understood as an epistemological form that merits a place in our understanding of the history of sexuality in the early national period. More simply put, botani cal taxonomy—a science of sexuality that recognized difference or new ness in objects as a moment of the possibility of knowledge to come—</page><page sequence="4">96) EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 48, NUMBER 1 allows us to rethink the problem of whether or not Deborah Sampson's contemporaries understood her sexual difference in modern sexual terms. We should conceive of this question in terms of whether Sampson's culture recognized her sexual difference as a possible object for scientific inquiry. Because Mann's reliance on a heavily botanical idiom in his representation of Sampson posits her as something of a "new specimen," in whom the potential for knowledge of her sexual difference is conceived to be pos sible, but of whom no nomenclature yet exists, in this essay I insist that we include the history of opacity as a fungible site of inquiry for the study of early sexuality. A PHENOMENON, WHICH BEFORE APPEARED A NATURAL OBJECT Set in Middleboro, Massachusetts, toward the end of the Revolutionary War, The Female Review narrates the story of a real-life historical figure, Deborah Sampson, who on May 20,1782, dressed herself in men's clothes and enlisted in the Continental Army. She sustained her active enlistment until October 25,1783, when she was discovered to be female bodied and was subsequently discharged. The novel proceeds in the form of what we might now call a fairly conventional bildungsroman: born poor and hired out to local families as an indentured servant, Sampson is depicted as a self-educated, natural genius coming of age during the rise of anticolo nial sentiment in rural Massachusetts. About two-thirds of the novel de scribes Sampson's youth, and specifically, the steps that she took to secure her education. While Mann does include details of Sampson's path to self education that fall into a more traditional style of learning—including borrowing schoolbooks belonging to the children of the families for whom she worked—Mann, himself a self-taught naturalist of sorts, spends a great deal of time describing how Sampson educates herself through her time outside, observing the physical laws of the flora, fauna, and cosmos. The remainder of the novel describes Sampson's decision to join the Continen tal Army, including details of various injuries, battles, and scouting trips she endures before falling ill and being discovered to be a woman. The novel concludes with Deborah being discharged from the army, and travel ing to her uncle's farm, dressed as her brother Ephraim, where she con tinues to live as a man through the book's conclusion.</page><page sequence="5">Precipitous Sensations {97 The publication and reception history of The Female Review are framed by repeated acts of recovery. Both Sampson's story and the novel itself sus tained multiple revisions as they were published, forgotten, recovered, and republished between 1784, when a short, article-length account of Samp son's military discharge appeared in the New York Gazette, and 1916, when William Abbatt published the most recent edition of Mann's The Female Review in Tarrytown, New York. Herman Mann was responsible for the early editions of the novel that remain available to scholars; he authored the 1797 first edition, wrote an oratory version of Sampson's story that she delivered repeatedly during a lecture tour in 1802, published another short version of Sampson's story in an 1820 edition of the Dedham Village Reg ister, and authored a 429-page, first-person manuscript in 1829 that never made it into publication. After Mann's death in 1833, the novel remained out of print until 1866, when John Adams Vinton republished it in the wake of the recent Civil War. Brief biographies of Sampson also appeared in Elizabeth Eilet's 1848 The Women of the American Revolution, an Octo ber 1863 issue of the periodical Beadle's Dime Tales, and a 1975 Scholastic Biography Series text (aimed at North American second graders) entitled The Secret Soldier. Mann's novel was republished for the last time in 1916, when William Abbatt reprinted Vinton's edition, with his introduction. This publication history, while certainly somewhat unusual for a novel that could only boast of about two hundred subscribers at the time of its publi cation, also importantly participated in the process by which Sampson be came an object of knowledge based on sexual difference in her own time. Despite the status that it claims as an autobiography or "memoir"—the subtitle of Mann's text is "Memoirs of an American Young Lady"—schol ars of eighteenth-century literature now identify The Female Review as par ticipating in a contemporary trend in popular fiction that Daniel Cohen and Diane Dugaw have called the "cross-dressing narrative" and the "war rior woman" tale, respectively, a genre of popular literature that regularly titillated its readers with allusions to same-sex sexual behavior.6 From Martinette of Charles Brockden Brown's novel Ormond (1799) to Pulchera of the anonymously authored, wildly popular Constantius and Pulchera; or, Virtue Rewarded (1794), a wealth of American fiction published during the last decade of the eighteenth century features female characters who disguise themselves or even live as men. While Dugaw and Cohen have written book-length studies on the print evolution and transnational cul</page><page sequence="6">98} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 48, NUMBER 1 tural origins of these figures, relatively little scholarship exists that focuses on the fascinating genealogy of women in martial attire in popular fiction; recent work by literary scholars of the early national period such as Susan Lanser and Katherine Binhammer have effectively sketched out the rela tionship between these "warrior women" and British radical feminism's "unsex'd females" so scorned by anti-Jacobins such as Richard Polwhele.7 By the mid-eighteenth century, however, a handful of popular autobio graphical narratives describing the lives of female soldiers had appeared in print in England, the most familiar of which would probably have been The Female Soldier; or, The Surprising Life and Adventures of Hannah Snell (1750). By the early nineteenth century, many of these ballads and cross dressing narratives had appeared in print in the United States, and it is likely that Herman Mann, Charles Brockden Brown, Tabitha Tenney, and many more American writers were familiar with this genre of folk imagery. Like most warrior woman narratives, The Female Review begins by de scribing Sampson's family history, early life, and upbringing. Unlike some of the more popular examples of this genre (such as The Female Soldier, for example), however, Mann's narrator's introduction to Sampson's child hood and disposition is rife with biological imagery and metaphor, a nar rative texture that sets The Female Review apart from contemporary rep resentations of cross-dressing female soldiers. In describing Sampson's efforts to educate herself, for example, Mann notes that because the family to whom she was indentured "appeared more eager in the amassing of for tune than of scientific acquisition, [Sampson] was obliged to check the bud" (33) of her intellect and was not offered the opportunity to go to school. Mann further warns of the dangers of a lack of education, musing that "the most fertile genius, like that of soil, which for want of proper cul tivation is overrun with noxious weeds, becomes corrupted by neglect and vicious habit: and the inherent beauties that might have eclipsed a more than ordinary show, lie dormant" (29). Furthermore, he refers to intellect as a gift that, unfortunately, nature bestows "unequally ... on the human species" (26; emphasis added). This use of "species," the "bud" of Sampson's intellect, and the "fertile . . . soil" of intelligence that can suffer from the "noxious weeds" of lacking "proper cultivation" clearly illustrates the natu ralist, and often specifically botanical, metaphor through which the nar ration of Sampson's childhood proceeds. And while the narration is gen erally infused with this botanical metaphoric, this narratological trend is</page><page sequence="7">Precipitous Sensations {99 far more pronounced during episodes of The Female Review that describe Sampson's sexual difference, or depict her romantic exploits with women. Though numerous editors of this text over the last two hundred years have remarked on what one nineteenth-century editor, John Adams Vin ton, calls its "prolix and verbose" writing (9), of primary concern to this essay are the ways in which Mann's narrative style is, quite literally, flowery. The saving grace that serves to render many of the extremely confusing or syntactically vexed passages of Mann's The Female Review more legible is its constant return to the vocabulary of the natural sciences. Metaphors that invoke the natural world are something of a ubiquity in fiction, in the eighteenth century as they are today, to the point that this type of language tends to become unremarkable or invisible, a fact of the narratological en virons. If we shift our focus from Mann's explanation of Sampson's reasons for living as a man and engaging in romances with women to the botanical vocabulary that he frequently deploys in depicting these unconventional behaviors, Mann's botanical taxonomy for Sampson's gender difference and sexual variance comes into stark focus. Botanical taxonomy was something of a recent development at the time Mann penned The Female Review, and although Linnaeus's system of bi nomial nomenclature had achieved a certain primacy by the end of the eighteenth century, more than fifty-two other systems of botanical taxon omy had been invented, debated, and rejected by 1799.8 Linneaus's Systema Naturae stood out among competing taxonomical systems because it or ganized the classification of plants along one fundamental axis: Linnaeus anthropomorphically categorizes plants according to their sex, and the kinds of "marriages" —singular, polygamous, and incestuous—that plants engage in with the flora around them.9 Botany thus occupied a designa tion within the popular imagination as a science of sexuality, and played a crucial role in shaping popular perceptions of sexual diversity in the last half of the eighteenth century in both western Europe as well as in the North American colonies. According to Thomas Hallock, botany became a major cultural idiom defining public discussions of sex in the later half of the eighteenth century; he argues that "from the mid-eighteenth century through the 1790s, plant study intersected with issues of sexual propriety," a statement with which Richard Polwhele would have certainly agreed.10 The readings that follow offer a vehicle through which we might ap proach Mann's representation of Sampson's sexuality in The Female Re</page><page sequence="8">100 } EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 48, NUMBER 1 view from a different direction. Mann consistently describes—and often excuses or apologizes for—Sampson's "singular" and explicitly different sexual behaviors within a botanical idiom. The introduction to Sampson's childhood that occupies the first four chapters of the book is replete with naturalist imagery that couches the reader's understanding of Sampson in botanical terms. Mann himself was something of an amateur botanist, student of early astronomy, and natural science enthusiast overall, and references to these scientific discourses permeate The Female Review. In describing Sampson's efforts at self-education, Mann writes with "pecu liar pleasure I here find occasion to speak of Miss Sampson's taste for the study of Nature, or Natural Philosophy" (39). Not only should we read this as evidence of a contemporaneous cultural vocabulary through which Sampson's early life might be described, but we must also note that Mann's narrator sketches a causal relationship between Sampson's early botani cal interests and the "singular" personality and "passions" that later distin guish her adult character. As Mann's narrator explains, Sampson's taste for the cultivation of plants and vegetable productions in general, appears to have been somewhat conspicuous in her early years. And she has intimated an idea of this kind, which, from its justness, and the delicate effects it has on many of the softer passions, induces me to notice it. It has been a source of astonishment and mortification to her that so many of her own as well as of the other sex, can dwell with rap ture on a romantic scene of love, a piece of painting or sculpture, and, perhaps, upon things of more trivial importance; and yet can walk in the stately and venerable grove, can gaze upon the beautifully varie gated landscape, can look with indifference upon the rose and tulip, or can tread on a bank of violets and primroses, without appearing to be affected with any peculiar sensations and emotions. This certainly proceeds from a wrong bias of the mind in its fixing on its first ob jects of pursuit. And parents cannot be too careful in the prevention of such errors, when they are forming the minds of their offspring for the courses which are to affect the passions, and give sway to the behavior during life. (42-43) The cultivation of plants and other verdure thus directs the cultivation of Sampson's "softer passions," understood in the eighteenth century to be love, compassion, sympathy, tenderness, and so on. Importantly, in a de</page><page sequence="9">Precipitous Sensations {101 cade widely studied for its muscular propagation of the ideology of repub lican womanhood—a central tenet of which pertains to the importance of proper parenting in the process of raising good male citizens—these "softer passions" are also the feelings associated with republican mother hood, and contemporaries such as Benjamin Rush advocated publicly at the turn of the century for the proper "cultivation" of new Americans. In this passage, however, Sampson's instincts for cultivation are directed toward unexpected objects: her "peculiar sensations and emotions" come from gazing at plants, which the narrator lauds as proper objects to stimu late these feelings. Here, the narrator draws an analogy between Sampson's experience of nature and cultural understandings of the experience of romance, under standing the development of "passions" or other romantic feelings to be the result of encounters with art or the artistic. This would have been an extremely familiar conversation for contemporary readers of The Female Review, especially for female readers who were well versed in both novel reading and the cultural anxieties that reading too many novels provoked.11 That "so many of [Sampson's] own as well as of the other sex, can dwell with rapture on a romantic scene of love, a piece of painting or sculpture, and perhaps, upon things of more trivial importance; and yet can walk in the stately and venerable grove .. . without appearing to be affected with any peculiar sensations or emotions," speaks to the fact that what is at issue here is an ethics of the relative appropriateness or inappropriateness of that which induces or provokes passionate feeling. Importantly, the narrator implies in this passage that what readers might consider the "natural" ori gins of romantic feelings are not, in fact, natural, and that deriving "sensa tions or emotions" from "romantic scene [s] of love" can result in a "wrong bias of the mind." In elevating the natural world as the proper object by which to stimulate "sensations and emotions," Mann renaturalizes nature and the natural world as central terms in human romantic and sensual life. Furthermore, Mann's narrator focuses on the "peculiar sensations and emotions" that might proceed "from a wrong bias of the mind in its fixing on its first objects of pursuit." These "peculiar sensations and emotions," in this passage, are continuous with "the passions" that are discussed in the last sentence; all of these sensations, emotions, and passions are described by Mann's narrator to be the result of observing various scenes, whether it be "romantic scene[s] of love" or "a bank of violets and primroses." What</page><page sequence="10">102 } EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 48, NUMBER 1 the narrator wants his readers to understand in this passage is that sensa tions, emotions, and passions that are derived from looking on the natural world—the grove, the landscape, or the rose, tulip, violet, or primrose — are also natural or organic feelings, and furthermore, that these feelings should be sanctioned and privileged as such. On the other hand, "peculiar sensations and emotions" that are derived from what we understand to be romance—"romantic scene [s] of love, a piece of painting or sculpture," or, in all likelihood, novels—are necessarily questionable because the source from which they are derived is itself suspect, a point on which William Hill Brown in 1789 and a host of historians of the novel in the twenty-first century would all concur.12 Thus, we should consider how an understand ing of the double-edge of these "peculiar sensations"—appropriate when derived from nature, and inappropriate when derived from the culture of "romance"—might contribute to our understanding of eighteenth-century sexuality. Because this passage both identifies the natural world as the only appropriate erotic stimulant and distinguishes Sampson's "peculiar sensa tions" from those of her peers (based on the objects that induce these sen sations), we can understand this moment as one in which Mann differen tiates between two types of sexuality. This distinction that Mann draws between Sampson's "sensations" and those of her peers resonates with important recent work in early Ameri can sexuality studies. As Jordan Stein argues in his 2009 article on the rep resentation of taste and hunger in Mary Rowlandson's captivity narrative, "expanding the repertoire of sexuality to include the cultivation of sen sations makes it possible to connect sexuality with other phenomena . . . to which sexuality is generally considered to be unrelated" (469). Stein's argument carries special import for scholars who focus on historical peri ods in which the epistemology of sex appears radically different from that which we assume it to be today. Focusing on The Sovereignty and Goodness of God, one of the foundations of Stein's argument is that in seventeenth century America, sexuality might "ha[ve] nothing to do with sex or bodies, but instead... reference... a certain kind of interiority, a deinstrumentali zation of sensation from bodily drive," that, in Stein's reading of Rowland son, becomes "legible in her hunger" (476). Sensation, then, becomes an important term in the history of sexuality because it can be understood as bearing a relationship to pleasure above and beyond the pleasure that ap</page><page sequence="11">Precipitous Sensations {103 pears as a by-product of the fulfillment of need, describing a form of sub jective experience that sutures embodiment to interiority.13 In The Female Review, Sampson's experience of "sensations" also tends to chart moments in which Sampson finds herself physiologically or other wise internally changed by her historio-political reality, a feeling that results in her decision to dress as a man and join the military. The narrator details, for example, that early local conflicts of the Revolutionary War, "both be fore and after the first engagement at Lexington, are well known to have af fected the minds, even of both sexes, throughout the Colonies, with sensa tions and emotions different from whatever they had before experienced" (55); these "sensations and emotions" provide the inducement to act on her burgeoning patriotism. This patriotism, in turn, "filled her mind with sensations, to which she had hitherto been unaccustomed—with a kind of enthusiasm, which strengthened and increased with the progression of the war" (60). In The Female Review, what Mann catachrestically glosses as Sampson's patriotism takes the form of interior sensation, but a set of sensations that cannot be fully described or exhausted by nationalist fer vor or mere patriotic sentiment. Describing the midnight scene in which Sampson dons her military uniform and leaves the family to whom she was indentured, readers are once again presented with the image of Samp son, overwhelmed by not only patriotic sensations but beyond that by feel ings specifically related to the physical process of donning her masculine, martial persona: "But there was none, but the INVISIBLE, who could take cognizance of the effusions of passion on assuming her new garb; but espe cially, on reflecting upon the use, for which it was assigned" (122; emphasis original). Readers understand Sampson's "effusions of passion" as first a response to her "assuming her new garb," and then also—but not exclu sively—as a response to the patriotic "use" of what the narrator very can didly describes as a nice-looking set of men's clothes. Sampson's experi ence of a seemingly overwhelming effusion of patriotic sensation, then, is inextricably linked to her decision to cross-dress, an act that was widely associated within contemporary popular culture with sexual lasciviousness or promiscuity more generally. Whether or not transvestitism constituted a sexual act in the eighteenth century is not at issue here; rather, the fact that Sampson's cross-dressing is explained as her response to her subjective ex perience of new sensations represents this act of cross-dressing as an ex</page><page sequence="12">104\ EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 48, NUMBER 1 pression of inferiority. Mann's discussion of sensation should thus be read as an example of one vocabulary through which early American culture imagined human sexual difference. To return to Mann's indictment of those readers who "can look with indifference upon the rose and tulip, or can tread on a bank of violets and primroses, without appearing to be affected with any peculiar sensations and emotions," this passage also serves to differentiate Sampson from her peers —the narrator implies that Sampson's "peculiar sensations" come not from traditional romance, but from beholding the natural world—and al though it valorizes this difference in perception as better than deriving the same sensations from romance, it nonetheless distinguishes Sampson as unique. This representation of Sampson's distinct sensual register, which, following Stein, I understand as a means of discussing what we now con sider sexuality, is furthermore explained in terms of its unmediated rela tionship to the natural world, and specifically, to the botanical. This passage does important work in The Female Review to explain Sampson's difference as one fundamentally defined by sensation, and moreover, sensation that derives from the cultivation and experience of the botanical world. Given the relationship between the rise of botany as a form of popular knowledge in the second half of the eighteenth century and botany's unique status as a science of sexuality, we must read this description of Sampson's in ternal difference—an observation that the narrator announces incessantly throughout the text—as one that even the narrator of The Female Review understands to be, in some way, about sex.14 ANIMAL LOVE, ON HER PART, WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION The internal sexual differences attributed to Sampson throughout The Female Review appear much more subtly, at least to present-day readers, than the far more overt narratological references to Sampson's romantic affairs with women. Indeed, the text tarries on moments where Sampson both courts and is courted by women whom she encounters in her travels with the Continental Army.15 Cross-dressing and "woman warrior" tales often feature scenes in which the cross-dressed protagonists accidentally or intentionally find themselves the object of romantic attentions from other women. Scholars generally understand these scenes as intended to both titillate and amuse, although in the case of Deborah Sampson, Mann</page><page sequence="13">Precipitous Sensations {105 also made explicit efforts to emphasize her normative womanhood in the name of her campaign to receive an invalid's pension for her service to the Continental Army. Like Mann's descriptions of Sampson's internal sexual difference, her liaisons with women—and with one woman in particular, who is referred to as "the Baltimore lady" throughout the novel—are in fused with botanic imagery. During the last decade of the eighteenth cen tury, however, popular botany was put to a slightly revised use, as not only an epistemological structure for understanding internal sexual difference, but also as a new means of understanding variety in social and sexual orga nization. As historians of science such as Londa Schiebinger and Frederike Teute have noted, the deployment of the metaphorics of popular botany became even more prevalent in contemporary descriptions of nonnorma tive social organization, a discursive shift largely due to the transatlantic circulation of Erasmus Darwin's extremely popular, two-part paean to Lin naean botanical taxonomy, The Botanic Garden (1791). The second half of Darwin's text, Loves of the Plants, uses poetic epic to describe the sexual passion and romantic organization of plant relationships, relying on a deeply anthropomorphic vocabulary for social relations to describe their various "marriages," "beds," "houses," "brotherhoods," and "unions." Fredrike Teute offers a clear and fairly concise overview of Darwin's ex tremely complicated system of organization in Loves of the Plants, writing, The first classes contained both sexes and were arranged according to the number of males in the blossom; XII had twenty males; XIII, "Poly andria," had "Many Males." The next classes depended on the "Powers," that is, the different heights, of the stamens. The ways in which males adhered in "their union" to the females determined succeeding classes: 'One Brotherhood,' 'Two Brotherhoods,' 'Many Brotherhoods,' 'Con federate Males,' and 'Feminine Males.' Two classes of plants had flowers containing only one sex, 'One House' and 'Two Houses'; in 'Polygamy,' there was a mixture of single-sex and both-sex flowers. Finally, in 'Clan destine Marriages,' flowers were not discernible in the plants. (324-25) Entirely anthropomorphic—the plants feel love, jealousy (or, at times, "unjealousy"), are married or polygamous, are male or female, brothers or sisters—Loves of the Plants endowed the science of botany with a quietly pornographic aesthetic that participated in wider, transatlantic conversa tions concerning new possibilities for human sociosexual organization.</page><page sequence="14">106] EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 48, NUMBER 1 Loves of the Plants was read alongside Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Woman in political groups and young, mixed-sex intellectual circles in New York in the last years of the eighteenth century; both texts, as Richard Polwhele highlighted in his The Unsex'd Females a few years later, reflected and propagated radically new notions about both the social and internal significance of gendered behavior and sexual propriety.16 What interests me about Linnaean botanical taxonomy and its subse quent deployment within late eighteenth-century debates over sexual poli tics is not, however, the way that this taxonomy contributed to the cultural belief in gender as a biological form of interior experience. Historians of science have put much work into demonstrating the degree to which the botanical science of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries relied on "the implicit use of gender to structure [its] taxonomy" (Schie binger 22), and the history of gender as a category of biological truth dif ferentiating human "kinds" has received much attention by scholars such as Thomas Laqueur and Ian Hacking. Though Schiebinger does note that under Linnaeus's taxonomy "not only were . . . plants sexed . . . they be came husbands and wives" (22), historical studies of botany have not yet adequately attended to the ways that Linnaeus's anthropomorphic sys tem of taxonomy also imagined plants to participate in forms of sexual behavior, organization, and expression that look startlingly like present day definitions of sexuality. Through the romantic drama of Loves of the Plants, Linnaeus's taxonomy was "anthropomorphized ... into an allegory of human sexual relations" (Moore 65), and in Darwin's epic, the spectrum of these sexual relations extends from the extremely conventional to the heterogeneous and frankly aberrant.17 This constitutes a crucial historical and cultural context through which to theorize how eighteenth-century readers would have encountered the moments in The Female Review in which Mann represents same-sex romance and sex acts between Sampson and her female lover. In the narrative itself, episodes depicting same-sex sex acts are over blown, dramatic, and often almost unreadable to nineteenth-century through present-day readers, and on some level, the overwrought con struction of these passages should not be surprising: Herman Mann had to perform some extremely complicated negotiations on behalf of his real life, and still very much alive, subject in order to portray her as not only a legitimate veteran of the Revolutionary War but also as a subject available</page><page sequence="15">Precipitous Sensations {107 for sympathy rather than derision or even prosecution. Mann did not pub lish The Female Review as solely a fictional enterprise; the text also bears a very explicit objective, as it was published while Sampson was campaign ing to receive an invalid pension from the US government after being wounded in the war. The fact of her cross-dressing did not appear unam bivalently brave or endearing to her culture, as it does to many readers who encounter this text today: Sampson's campaign for an invalid pension had to be levied in terms that legitimized her actions despite the fact that she was a woman, not because of it. Women who lived in military camps were widely considered socially suspect, although Sampson was not the first sol dier to be found female during the war; many women followed the army and lived in their camps, and married women not infrequently traveled to war with their husbands.18 While the presence of women in army camps was fairly common, any woman found living in an army camp was widely considered to be morally lax, or simply assumed to be a sex worker.19 Yet on being discovered to have a female's body, Sampson was not lambasted, tried for fraud, publicly humiliated, or prosecuted. Karen Weyler com pellingly argues that this was a result of the way that Sampson carefully shaped the dissemination of her story, approaching public literary figures such as Herman Mann and prominent newspaper editor Philip Freneau for publicity and support for her case.20 The records, rumors, and reports on which The Female Review is based, however, still contain multiple ac counts of intimate liaisons between Robert Shurtliff—Sampson's male per sona—and young women that are intimated to be of an erotic nature. In depicting Sampson as a hero rather than a prostitute, or even, as Philip Freneau putatively referred to her, an "eccentric," Mann had his work cut out for him. Mann effectively defends Sampson as a soldier worthy of not only his writerly attentions but also an invalid pension by returning to the same bo tanical idiom that characterizes his other descriptions of the cross-dressing soldier. In describing her liaisons with women, Mann slightly amends his former narratological approach, relying on a naturalist exceptionalism to normalize her aberrant behaviors. Related to, yet distinct from, the dis course surrounding the fascination with "wonders" of nature that histo rians of science such as Lorraine Daston, Katharine Park, Pamela Smith, and Paula Findlen have described as characterizing naturalist inquiries be tween the late twelfth through the late eighteenth centuries, Mann's nar</page><page sequence="16">108} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 48, NUMBER 1 ration of Sampson's behaviors still apologizes and justifies more than it celebrates. This justification, however, does rely upon the idea that nature sometimes begets life forms that appear supernatural or unnatural—Mann uses the example of a woman giving birth to octuplets—but these distinc tions are often earned by organisms or behaviors that are illegible to extant taxonomies or classifications. A generous reader might attribute Mann's incomprehensible prose to the fact that in these passages, Mann was trying to describe a wonder or exception in nature for which he had no reliable vocabulary. In Revolution and the Word, Cathy Davidson similarly remarks on the overblown, ridiculous writing that characterizes the narration of the con temporary and anonymously authored, female picaresque novel Constan tius and Pulchera (270-71). Even as Davidson asks the very important question about whether eighteenth-century readers could have under stood it, she also reminds current-day critics of the fact that Constantius and Pulchera was enormously popular, overblown prose or not. What I want to caution us against, then, is reading popularity as an indication of contemporary readers' comprehension of Mann's writing, especially as the passages in The Female Review that represent what seem to be moments of same-sex sex acts or desire are often rendered in prose that leave them some of the most difficult to understand. This might be because Mann was simply a bad writer; it might also be because Mann lacked a vocabu lary, or even a coherent epistemological matrix, for representing what Martha Vicinus and Judith M. Bennett term "lesbian-like" behavior. In deed, Mann's narrator often seems unable to explain, apologize for, or even describe the relationship that exists between Sampson and her lover (the text refers to her as "the Baltimore lady"), and at times, Mann specifically refuses to try. Sampson and the Baltimore lady's parting scene concludes as follows; Thus parted two lovers, more singular, if not more constant, than per haps, ever distinguished Columbia's soil. THIS event, as it is unnatural, may be disputed. It is also rare, that the same passion should ever have brought a woman to bed with seven children at a birth: And I think eight would rather be miraculous than natural. But it is said, that though perhaps the colouring is a little exag gerated, that this is a fact that will admit of incontestible [sic] evidence.</page><page sequence="17">Precipitous Sensations {109 Nor need females think themselves piqued to acknowledge it; as no one denies, she was not an agreeable object when masqueraded; why, by the by, I am sorry to say, is too often mistaken by that sex. THUS, we have a remarkable instance of the origin of that species of love, which renders the enjoyment of life satisfactory, and consummates the bliss of immortality. The passion entertained by the sexes towards each other is, doubtless, from this source; and will always be laudable, when managed with prudence. But I appeal to the lady's own bosom, if, after discovering her sister; her passion had not subsided into a calm, and have drooped, like the rose, or lilly [sic], on its dislocated stalk. (226-27; emphasis original) For the first time in the text, Mann's narrator identifies this liaison in so cially recognizable terms: he calls them "lovers," and continues to situate their relationship within the same naturalist discourse as I have been de scribing in my other readings of the novel. While "singular" or exceptional, the lovers grow from "Columbia's soil," and the "unnatural" qualities that Mann's narrator attributes to their passion seems to describe the social perception, rather than the reality, of the relationship. Analogizing it to a woman who gives birth to octuplets, a rare event to be sure, Mann's narra tor explains that the singularity of the event—their passion, or the instance of octuplets—would "be rather miraculous than natural." But the effect of the first full paragraph here is that Mann's narrator is defending the un usual, the unlikely, and the seemingly unnatural as, in fact, part of nature. He supports this claim by gesturing to scientific approaches to understand ing nature: "this is a fact that will admit of incontestible evidence." This evidentiary claim for the status of the rare or seemingly unnatural as existing within nature takes on a specifically sexual charge, as Mann's narrator admits that "it is also rare, that the same passion should ever have brought a woman to bed with seven children at a birth." I want to empha size the use of "the same passion," here, because that which a passion that could beget ocuplets is similar to, is the passion between Sampson and the Baltimore lady, described in the previous paragraph. Reproductive "pas sion" is sexual passion, but that "same passion" as Mann's narrator under stands them to share is also the passion that begets a rare and perhaps unnatural number of offspring. The narrator, however, quickly recodes this rare occurrence, not as unnatural, but as "miraculous." Changing the</page><page sequence="18">110 } EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 48, NUMBER 1 emotional valence of the "singular" nature of the attachment between the young Continental soldier and her lover amounts to renaturalizing behav iors and sex acts that would ordinarily be rejected from the category of the natural. In this passage, furthermore, exceptions within nature—miracles, octuplets, and "passion" between people of the same sex—are clearly de limited as anomalous, yet Mann's narrator still claims them as instances within nature itself. The paragraph that follows supports this argument, as Mann's narra tor offers a short aside to his female readership, as he is frequently wont to do throughout the text. He once again characterizes Sampson and her Baltimore lover as "a remarkable instance of the origin of that species of love" —anachronistically calling to mind the most famous of Charles Dar win's writings for our time—which even more obviously relies on a sci entific or botanical idiom for its explication. Their love is a "species," and furthermore, a "remarkable" one, that offers the narrator a glimpse into what he considers the "origin" of heterosexual love, and, we assume, mar riage. The move to argue that "the passion entertained by the sexes towards each other is, doubtless, from this source" is a fascinating one, especially as in so arguing, the narrator effectively posits that this "remarkable" or "miraculous" love can be considered an archetype for marriage or mari tal happiness. Significantly, however, Mann identifies marital "passion" as "from this source," derived from rather than identical to Sampson and her lover's affection, further differentiating between different classes of love. Mann's narrator seems to sense the almost incredible nature of this claim, too, as he succeeds it with a short appeal to his female readers, asking them to imagine themselves in the place of the Baltimore lady. In an "appeal to the lady's own bosom" he asks her if, "after discovering her sister" — discovering her presumably male lover to have a woman's body—"her pas sion had not subsided into a calm, and have drooped, like the rose, or lilly, on its dislocated stalk." This is a difficult passage to parse, but I read this reference to a different form of women "botanizing together" as yet another instance of Mann's disjointed prose, and interpret it as Mann demanding sympathy of his female readers. This "appeal" asks them to consider whether, upon finding their lover to be a "sister," their passion for someone who "no one denies... was an agreeable object when masqueraded" would have actually sub sided or not. The narrator preemptively excuses the fact that ladies might</page><page sequence="19">Precipitous Sensations {in maintain an attraction to a handsome figure that they find, afterward, to be a woman, "nor need females think themselves piqued to acknowledge it." Later in the text, Mann's narrator actually exhorts his female readership to admit their own attraction to his cross-dressing protagonist, admonishing, "REMEMBER, females, I am your advocate; and, like you, would pay my devoirs to the goddess of love. Admit that you conceived an attachment for a female soldier. What is the harm? She acted in the department of that sex, whose embraces you naturally seek" (248). An understanding of the narrator's naturalizing impulse helps us read the aforementioned "appeal" to the lady reader, in order that she might excuse the Baltimore lady's ostensibly sexual transgressions with another woman, because the lady reader can imagine herself falling into the same confusing trap. This reader should understand why Sampson's Baltimore lover's "passion had not subsided into a calm, and have drooped, like the rose, or lilly, on its dislocated stalk." This obviously phallic image offers a fascinating botanical and metaphoric illustration of Mann's narrator's understanding of the possibility for sexual love between a woman and a mannish woman, or a woman living as a man. The "rose, or lilly" are both images traditionally gendered as female, although here these flowers are depicted more holistically, with an evocation of their "stalk" as well, ex panding the metaphor to suggest that some women bear "stalks" along side their "blossoms." The fact that the "dislocated stalk" is appended to the feminine image of these flowers lends a texture of phallic failure to the relationship between Sampson and her Baltimore lover, which is charac teristic of pejorative depictions of tribades and "female husbands" in the literary culture of the eighteenth century more generally.21 This passage that depicts Sampson parting with her lover for the last time participates in the botanically infused sexual discourse that this essay describes: it de ploys the natural science of botany as a means of discussing sexual differ ence, and exposes sexuality as a category of taxonomic knowledge. Despite this, however, in the narration of Sampson's romantic interactions with her paramour in Baltimore, Mann also illustrates that no taxonomy yet exists that adequately characterizes the "species" of love between them. This is undoubtedly in part because of the vastly different cultural terms for describing aberrant sex that characterize presexology understandings of human sexuality. But I would also insist that we keep Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's injunction from her introduction to Epistemology of the Closet</page><page sequence="20">112 } EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 48, NUMBER 1 in mind: a lack of knowledge of or vocabulary for sexual formations that challenge the prerogative of the state can be as indicative of a willful igno rance as it might be of a simple silence. Martha Vicinus, following Sedg wick, reminds us of this fact in her polemical "Lesbian History: All Theory and No Facts or All Facts and No Theory" (1994), writing, "As Eve Kosof sky Sedgwick has said in regard to male homosexuality, ignorance is not an empty box waiting to be filled by knowledge. Ignorance now and in prior times can be willed" (58). Ignorance and opacity or nonknowledge can be understood as cotermi nous; for my purposes, however, it is more important to understand the historical conditions under which both ignorance and opacity were able to thrive as categories of a particular kind of knowledge about sexuality. In Mann's inability to taxonomize Sampson's participation in her various romantic friendships or sexual relationships, I also think that we can see some of this willful ignorance; for example, when musing about the details of the nature of Sampson's relationship to other women, Mann refuses to speculate, demurring, "but to mention the intercourse of our Heroine with her sex, would, like others more dangerous, require an apology I know not how to make. It must be supposed, she acted more from necessity, than a voluntary impulse of passion; and no doubt, succeeded beyond her ex pectations, or desires. Harmless thing! A useful veteran in war!—An in offensive companion in love!" (247). Describing Sampson's romances as stemming from "necessity" rather than a "voluntary impulse of passion" also tangentially reverberates with the renaturalizing narrative strategies that I have already identified as operating within The Female Review; this statement renders her romances a biological inevitability, like breathing or reproduction. In this deferral, however, we can also observe how this nar rative renaturalization itself participates in creating and sustaining epis temologies of both ignorance and opacity surrounding aberrant forms of presexology sexuality. conclusion: we are in the dark Alfred Young, whose 2004 biography of Deborah Sampson, Masquer ade, constitutes the most recent scholarly effort to shed light on her sexual proclivities, unequivocally denies her lesbianism at the end of the book.22 Regarding several episodes that suggest Sampson's sexual dalliances with</page><page sequence="21">Precipitous Sensations {113 women in her town of Middleboro, Massachusetts, however, Young de murs, remarking simply that "we are in the dark" as to their significance or veracity (81). A central tension of this essay is whether or not we are, in fact, in the dark. I am interested in this reticence, expressed by Young alongside many other critics and historians of The Female Review or Sampson's life more generally, emphatically and repeatedly to highlight all that we do not or cannot know about Deborah Sampson, alongside historicist readings of her behavior that serve to naturalize or make quotidian precisely those facts of her life that would later ensure its historical staying power. His torians and literary critics alike seem to take great pains to contextualize, to historicize, and to situate Sampson as an unsurprising product of her time—not unlike Mann's narration of Sampson's life itself. The attitude with which contemporary critics portray her, however, remains inconsis tent with the rather difficult to access, yet growing archive of materials on Sampson's life and Mann's representation thereof. It is unusual, as many scholars of early American literatures would surely concur, to find such a relatively extensive body of scholarship surrounding the life of a poor, for merly indentured soldier who fought for less than three years during the later portion of the Revolutionary War. The many disavowals of Sampson's singularity are belied by the many attentions that have been aimed in her direction over the past two centuries. I am arguing that this idea, expressed almost universally though in variegated terms by everyone from her first biographer, Herman Mann, to her most recent, Alfred Young, that "we are in the dark" about Sampson's life or motivations, is actually a representational trend that has appended itself to historical knowledge about sexuality. For what is not being spoken when we identify ourselves as "in the dark" is precisely what we are in the dark about; we know much, much more about Deborah Sampson than we do about other poor, enlisted men who fought during the Revolutionary War. What we don't know about Deborah Sampson is what relationship, if any, that we, as twenty-first century scholars of the social formation that we call sexuality, can draw between Sampson's seductively recognizable gender presentation and sexual proclivities and those that exist today. There is another side to what, at times, feels like a critical commitment to not knowing—the act of knowing, of course, being as historical a con struction as anything else—or to simply making the decision to identify</page><page sequence="22">114 } EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 48, NUMBER 1 Deborah Sampson as a lesbian or transgendered person avant la lettre. The slim body of critical work that focuses in any way on Mann's The Female Review, or on Deborah Sampson more generally, contains endless denials of her lesbianism, despite the existence of as many stories, "authenticated" or otherwise, requiring these denials. This critical push-and-pull—or, per haps more appropriately, call and response—is important, because it em phasizes the ontological chasm between what appear to be identical objects of knowledge. A further epistemological and ethical quandary is posed when we ask whether these objects of knowledge—same-sex sex acts in the eighteenth century and same-sex sex acts today, for example—differ in some fundamental way due to historically distinct modes of perceiving them, or whether they differ only insofar as separate vocabularies exist to describe them. One of the many fascinating things about Deborah Samp son's story is precisely how much The Female Review resembles, at times, the present-day genre of lesbian historical romance, such as books like Isabel Miller's Patience and Sarah or the BBC series Tipping the Velvet (set in the Victorian era); despite the two centuries separating these texts' pub lication dates, they read like literary kin.23 Similarly, it is difficult to read Mann's novel without feeling drawn to the kind of reading that Jay Prosser offers of the later, but still resonant protagonist of Radclyffe Hall's The Well of Loneliness: Prosser identifies Stephen Gordon as experiencing a kind of gender inversion before transsexuality existed as a category of gender experience. At the same time as I recognize, or perhaps misrecognize, re verberations of present-day lesbian cultural representations in The Female Review, I am also well aware of the extreme paucity—a practical nonexis tence—of records suggesting that anything like modern sexual identity was available in the late eighteenth century. As a scholar of what I increas ingly think of as sexual opacity, my analysis of these exciting but frustrating episodes of historical sex might best be described as precipitous, the edge of two impulses: the first being the Jamesonian exhortation to "always his toricize" and reject the idea that modern sexual formations could be rep resented without the language of modern sexuality; and the second being to submit to the seduction of identification, to see usable history in these moments, and to respond to the call of what many scholars would consider the anachronistic abyss. Despite the paralysis that the tension between these two impulses cre ates, I want to return to precipitousness as a way of conceptualizing pre</page><page sequence="23">Precipitous Sensations {115 sexology sexuality that can incorporate both of these relationships to history. The implicit sexual politics of botanical taxonomy and their de ployment as a mode of representing unfamiliar sex acts and behaviors at the end of the eighteenth century provides a model that can mobilize both of these disparate historiographie approaches into a history of aberrant presexology sexuality. The cultural conditions that allowed for scientific inquiry into sexuality—initiated by popular botany—simultaneously cre ated a form of knowledge about sexuality marked by illegibility or opacity; scientific inquiry exposes what we do not know as frequently as it pro duces new knowledge. Popular botany does offer present-day scholars a new means of conceptualizing how residents of early national America might have come to describe and understand Deborah Sampson; however, popular botany obscured as much as it illuminated, and contributed to the construction of new forms of epistemological opacity as well as to the fetishization of unfamiliarity, a proximate sexuality in its own right that I address elsewhere in my work. Rather than trying to illuminate or eradi cate moments when the historical record surrounding sexual and gender aberrance leave us without answers, we must amend our historiographical approach to presexology sexuality and consider opacity not as a veil hiding any "truth" of sexual behavior or experience, but as a cultural institution or practice in its own right, bearing its own "characteristic climates and tex tures" (Love 746).24 Epistemological precipitousness offers us a means of thinking about how to think about what we may or may not be "in the dark" about in our research pertaining to Sampson's life and times. Another means of ex pressing the aforementioned representative trope of opacity, or being on the verge of or to the side of knowledge, is to insist that we carve out a place in the history of sexuality for precipitousness—in individuals, in knowledge, in narrative, and in contemporary cultural vocabularies for as sessing difference. I am not suggesting that we understand this incipience or precipitousness as teleological; in fact, I am advocating for precisely the opposite, that we understand precipitousness as a nondynamic state of knowledge, action, or difference bearing no future. Sampson, herself, retrospectively described her decision to enlist in the Continental Army in terms of precipitousness: "I swerved from the accustomed flowry paths of female delicacy, to walk upon the heroic precipice of feminine perdition!" (Gannett 24). The precipitousness with which Sampson characterizes her</page><page sequence="24">116} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 48, NUMBER 1 experience is defined by loss or lack—the perdition of femininity—rather than by a positive or identifiable change of state; while Sampson describes the "precipice" of "feminine perdition" as "heroic," the precise nature of feminine perdition itself remains opaque. In other words, unfamiliarity and opacity, within both the historical record and the experience of our late eighteenth-century subjects of inquiry, are both familiar and genera tive experiences. The epistemological precipitousness that I am describing here is not situated within an emergence argument—or, rather, it is not situated within a narrative about any specific emergence. Precipitousness describes a temporally bound response to a lack of knowledge; it exists as a place holder, an aesthetics of unknowing that will likely not last very long. It is nonteleological precisely because epistemological precipitousness is about running up against the limits of what is currently known. When Alfred Young writes that "we are in the dark" regarding Sampson's behaviors that rendered her a sexual suspect in her community, we do not believe that, as her biographer, Young thinks that we will always be in the dark. There will be additions to the archive, a more extensive biography or study will ap pear, conditions of knowledge will change, and what we once thought that we could not know about Deborah Sampson will, at some point, become known; but what will become known is never a given, and it can never be understood apart from the present moment of the culture in which it is produced. This is what I mean by an epistemological precipitousness characterizing representations of Sampson, with a specific view to her gen der presentation and sexual activities; accounting for this precipitousness might be of further use as a historiographical tool for the study of pre sexology sexuality. The status of the unknown or unfamiliar at the end of the eighteenth century should not, then, remain understated or over looked; this essay complicates the claim among historians of presexology sexuality that we cannot classify genders and sexual behaviors using mod ern vocabularies for sexuality that would not have been familiar to our eighteenth-century subjects of inquiry. Understanding precipitousness as a category of both eighteenth-century and current understandings of sexu ality allows us to identify characterizations of difference or human varia tion drawn along the lines of sexuality or gender presentation, without having to argue that residents of eighteenth-century America, or scholars</page><page sequence="25">Precipitous Sensations {117 of eighteenth-century American culture, understood those differences in identical terms. NOTES 1 In a 1792 review of Darwin's The Botanic Garden that appeared in the New York based Loudon's Register, an anonymous writer identifies Linnaeus as "the author of the sexual system of botany." In Ireland, Walker's third edition of Elements of Geography describes his use of "the Linnaean system, which is founded on the sexuality of plants" (125). Darwin himself explicitly refers to Linnaean taxonomy as the "Sexual System of Botany" in the preface to the 1795 third edition of The Botanic Garden as well. This organization of Linnaeus's "sexual system" (as well as Darwin's Loves of the Plants) relied on an analogical logic to understand plant sexual variation that was built on extant understandings of human anatomy and dominant discourse surrounding sexual practices. This analogical epistemology was, in fact, older than either Linnaeus or Darwin; in Grew's Anatomy of Plants, for example, the author writes of a plant in which "the blade (or stamen) does not unaptly resemble a small penis, with the sheath upon it, as its praeputium" (170). 2 I am using the term sexuality to indicate the way by which plants' sexual organs were assumed to perform a truth-telling function about the nature of the organ ism itself. The popular deployment of Linnaean taxonomical principles asserted that the characteristic essence of the plant—that which determined its place in relation to other plants—is determined by its sexual organs and role in patterns of sexual reproduction. This cultural understanding of sexual behavior as reflect ing some sort of truth of a stable inner character lends a Foucauldian strain to scientific discussions about sexual behaviors that appeared during the 1790s. 3 My use of "presexology" rather than "premodern" highlights two conceptual foundations within my thinking; first, that "modernity" is a slippery and unstable periodizing signifier (and one that, by many accounts, can have three possible historical locations: c. 1600, c. 1800, and c. 1900-1918) that is not particularly useful for the study of early sexuality, and second, that cultural understandings of the relationship between sex and human inferiority markedly changed with the rise of formal sexology, initiated at least in part by the antivice campaigns and population control initiatives that started in Boston and Paris in 1815-20 and 1835, respectively. 4 Mann's prose is famously convoluted. Readers and editors of The Female Review from John Adams Vinton in 1866 through Jonathan Ned Katz in 2009 consis tently comment on how difficult it is to read Mann's novel. 5 Mann, himself, was something of a philosophe of the natural world, and of as tronomy in particular. The first quarter of The Female Review tarries on Samp son's experiences growing up in rural Massachusetts, and of the way that this</page><page sequence="26">JlS} EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 48, NUMBER 1 world guided her process of self-education. This writing reflects Mann's fairly widely disseminated ideas on education and the natural sciences, which readers can find in his The Material Creation: Being a Compendious System of Universal Geography and Popular Astronomy (1818) or in his The Columbian Primer (1802), both of which he initially published himself. On Mann's engagement with late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century popular science and educational theo ries, see Hiltner's discussion of Mann's later writing in "'She Bled in Secret.'" 6 Dugaw identifies the beginnings of the "warrior woman" as a motif in popu lar song and balladry, originating as a Restoration-era hero on broadsides and in chapbooks alongside other popular folk heroes such as Robin Hood (15-16). Both Dugaw and Cohen trace the imagery of the "warrior woman" to popular ballads and putatively (auto)biographical narratives that circulated in England and western Europe more generally from the second half of the seventeenth century through the mid-i8oos. Other examples of this genre to appear in the late eighteenth century included The History of the Female Shipwright (1773) and The Life and Surprising Adventures of Mary Anne Talbot in the Name of JOHN TAYLOR (1809). Davidson notes the existence of an even more extensive "fad for female adventures starring women in their plots and almost always in their titles—The Female Fishers, The Female Marine, The Female Robinson Crusoe, The Female Spy. A Domestic Tale, The Female Wandered, The Female Spy; or, The Child of the Brigade—even The Female Land Pirate" (279). Cohen describes the pub lication history and evolution of what he calls the "cross-dressing narratives" of Lucy Brewer and Louisa Baker (ostensibly the same character or person), a popular and questionably fictional text that appeared in at least twenty-one editions between 1815 and 1818. Cohen's anthology also includes The Surprising Adventures of Almira Paul (1822), thus establishing the genealogy of the "war rior woman" figure as extending from the late seventeenth century through the early nineteenth. Gustafson supplements the extent research on the history of the warrior woman figure, reminding readers that not only was Mann partici pating in a tradition drawn from popular balladry but he was also engaging in a Revolution-era conversation over the changing performances of republican womanhood. Referring to Charles Brockden Brown and John Daly Burk (whose 1798 play, Female Patriotism, offered a dramatic retelling of the story of Joan of Arc), Gustafson argues that representations of Sampson's life pose serious ques tions about how emergent nationalisms shaped possibilities for new forms of womanhood as the eighteenth century came to a close, in turn highlighting the mutable and performative nature of womanhood more generally. 7 See Lanser, "Tory Lesbians," and "Mapping Sapphic Modernity"; and Bin hammer. 8 See Schiebinger. Schiebinger writes that the fad for taxonomical systems—"system madness"—by the end of the eighteenth century was "truly epidemical'" (14). 9 Technically, Linnaeus's taxonomic system was later replaced by the binomial</page><page sequence="27">Precipitous Sensations {119 taxonomic system (developed by Gaspard and Johann Bauhin two centuries after Linnaeus), in which all life forms have a two-word name to describe them (e.g., homo sapien, although this was actually a Linnaean binomial). Linnaeuss system was nonetheless the inspiration for the later binomial system, and he is widely considered the inventor of popular scientific taxonomy. 10 Hallock attributes this to Linnaeus, arguing that the taxonomy developed by Carolus Linnaeus, to which Collinson and the self-taught Bartram converted in the 1740s, used pistils and stamens for clas sification, and commentary on Linnaeus's system ran the gamut from moral censure to liberated delight. William Smellie blasted the 'alluring seductions' of botany in the 1760 Encyclopedia Britannica, whereas Erasmus Darwin (Charles's grandfather) set Linnaeus to verse in a botanic paean to sexual free dom, The Loves of the Plants (1789). (698) Hallock also asserts that even the garden itself became a means of sexualized sociality, as plant exchange and experimentation became a culturally institution alized form of eroticism between men in the 1790s on the United States' Eastern Seaboard. Moore makes a similar case for the role of gardens in the sexualizing of Mary Delany's (1700-88) friendships with other women. 11 Critics of the eighteenth-century novel such as Davidson frequently note the pervasive cultural concern with the dangers of excessive reading. Think, for ex ample, of Brown's The Power of Sympathy (1789), in which Mrs. Holmes famously warns against the dangers of "immoderate reading," identifying too much read ing as a means by which a distasteful asociality might be cultivated. Asocial ity, importantly, was a means by which eighteenth-century writers and ministers discussed masturbation, and there is a wealth of scholarship on the history of the novel that links concerns about excessive novel reading to concerns about other materials that induce solitude, thoughtfulness, and masturbation. 12 Significantly, novels and other "romantic scene [s] of love" were understood to be dangerous precisely because they induced lewdness or other forms of what we, today, might identify as sexual feelings, although I want to be careful to avoid reifying "sex" as a stable or transhistorical category. Although lewdness or lust fulness in the eighteenth century would have certainly borne a sexual quality, lewdness or lustfulness was often more about appetite and social sanction than it was exclusively about sex acts or sexual desire. 13 For my purposes, Stein's most important point is that the "history of interiority is also a history of sexuality, insofar as 'sexuality' names a broad range of tools by which interiority can be recognized" (473). Presexology-era histories of plea sure, sensation, or feeling, then, constitute inquiries as proper to the history of early sexuality as more traditional sites of sexual research, e.g., eighteenth century family planning, bestiality, adultery, etc. Stein's thesis is Foucauldian, with a qualification: he argues that</page><page sequence="28">120 } EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE: VOLUME 48, NUMBER 1 "sexuality" simply designates the criteria by which modern persons recog nize subjective truth in psychosexual behaviors, relationships, or identities. Although sexuality is not usually or precisely equivalent to subjective interi ority, sexuality and related subjective truth-telling mechanisms (such as "sex" or "desire," indexed by the body but deinstrumentalized from reproductive function) are the most common technologies by which inferiority comes to be recognized and valued in the modern world. ... [I]n early America, it would seem that "sexuality" can name subjective truth-telling practices that are not, as they tend to be in the modern world, found exclusively among the genitals. (473) 14 This understanding of "sex" comprehends both what we think of as sexuality— sexual desire, "deinstrumentalized," as Stein would have it, from reproductive function—but also what we think of as gender, the way that biological sex is per formed in a social sense. 15 Mann's defense of Sampson's normative marriage and family life appears in his appendix to The Female Review (also see Gustafson 393023). 16 The Friendly Club of New York City, founded by Dr. Elihu Hubbard Smith and active in the 1790s, was an all-male intellectual club that considered "science ... a crucial collaborative medium for intellectual and social exchange" (Teute 321), and was one of many similar organizations that flourished for both men and women at the turn of the century. These intellectual circles tended to find in scientific learning and practice the opportunity for exploring new forms of heterosexual sociality, and Wollstonecraft was often read alongside Erasmus Darwin because both texts suggested new possibilities for sociosexual organiza tion, in forms ranging from new conventions of marriage to eschewing marriage altogether, from women's education to women's full participation in political life. 17 Moore understands Darwin's poetically eroticized flowers as part of "a long tra dition that viewed flowers as strongly suggestive of human eroticism. The later eighteenth-century English reception of Linnaeus capitalized on this history of sexual connotation for flowers. The notion of plants as possessors of a sexual life comparable to that of humans was extensively, even obsessively, imagined in The Loves of the Plants" (65). 18 Famously, another Massachusetts resident, Ann Bailey, had enlisted in the Con tinental Army in 1777, several years before Sampson, under the name of Samuel Gay. Bailey was exposed, arrested, and prosecuted (Weyler 183). Revolutionary era war records from Elizabeth, NJ, also indicate the presence of yet another sol dier found to be a woman, who was later strip-searched and marched out of the camp (Weyler 184; Hiltner, "Like a Bewildered Star" 9-10). 19 Hiltner argues that the widespread social belief that women in army camps were prostitutes constituted, at least in part, Sampson's decision to enlist as Shurtliff ("Like a Bewildered Star" 9-10). 20 While Freneau was initially hesitant to adopt her cause, privately calling Samp</page><page sequence="29">Precipitous Sensations {121 son an "eccentric," he later wrote the following poem of support, which appeared in the Dec. 4,1797, edition of The Time Piece "bearing the enigmatic inscription, 'A Soldier Should be Made of Sterner Stuff!" (Weyler 187): Ye Congress-men, and men of weight, Who fill the public chairs, Who many a favour have conferr'd, On men unknown to Mars— And ye, that on that lofty bench Decide by vote our great affairs, Ah, turn a calm attentive ear To HER, who never did fear— —Relieve this gallent Wench. 21 For a list of specific examples of eighteenth-century literary representations of tribades, see Comment. 22 Young's statement that "we are in the dark" refers specifically to Sampson's re lationship—rumored to be sexual—with a local free black domestic worker in her hometown. 23 Tipping the Velvet is a BBC historical drama (2002) based on a historical novel of the same name (by Sarah Waters, 1998) that follows its protagonist as she falls in love with a cross-dressing woman in the Victorian era in England. Patience and Sarah (published under the title A Place for Us in 1969) is a historical novel by Isabel Miller published in 1971, based on the real-life story of two women who built a life together in Connecticut in 1816. Both were, and continue to be, enor mously popular pieces of culture in many communities of queer women. 24 As Love writes on Ernesto Javier Martinez's article on queer modernism in her recent introduction to a set of articles in PMLA, "opacity, for Martinez, is not an absolute quality or the negation of knowledge; it has its characteristic cli mates and textures and is part of the experience of living with (if uncomfortably or partially) social identities" (746). She suggests that the writers whose essays she introduces "may suggest a new scene for queer modernism: not the episte mology of the closet but an encounter with the illegible. Queer lives and queer feelings scribbled over but still just visible—you can half make them out in the dark" (747). WORKS CITED Anonymous. "Love of the Plants."
