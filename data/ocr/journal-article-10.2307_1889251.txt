<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS 751 is provided by two letters written by Reuben M. Potter in 1844 giving the details of his secret mission to Vera Cruz to carry money for the Texan prisoners at Perote. It is real cloak-and-dagger in the best traditions. Dr. Connor and his assistants deserve the highest commendation for an onerous task well done. There is but one criticism, and the reviewer realizes that even it is hardly just. Because of the diversity of the letters and the multiplicity of correspondents, there are names of hundreds of persons con- cerning whom the reader might want to know more, but in the absence of annotation they remain unidentified. Admittedly, however, the task of sup- plying identifying notes would have required more extended research than was possible with the available resources. An adequate index, it should be stated, has been provided. Texas Western College REX W. STRICKLAND Presidential Ballots, 1836-1892. By W. Dean Burnham. (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1955. xx + 956 pp. Tables, appendix, and index. $10.00.) People who teach political or party history like to generalize about the vote in presidential elections. They speak of the New England vote, the Midwest vote, or the Southern vote almost as if an anthropomorphic New England, Midwest, or South east a clearly defined. ballot. Until recently, it was almost necessary to generalize in this 'way because no systematic compilations of election figures were readily available. It was only twenty years ago that Edgar E. Robinson published his pioneering compilation of detailed figures for the presidential elections, 1896-1932. Later, Robinson added a supple- mentary volume for 1936-1944. Now W. Dean Burnham has performed a similar service for earlier elections. Burnham has compiled statistics for the fifteen presidential elections from 1836 to 1892. He follows Robinson closely in organization and method. This makes it possible to use the works of the two men as a continuous statis- tical series from the 1830's to the 1940's. Of the two, Burnham had the more difficult task, Election machinery was not so well established in the earlier years and reliable figures by county were much harder to find. Moreover, during Burnham's period, the number of counties increased enormously .and it was no mean job to trace changes in county organization (he requires 3 pages and 152 lines to describe county changes in Texas alone). Finally, Burnham had to cope with the Reconstruction era and its irregular voting and conflicting returns. Burnham introduces the statistics with brief interpretative essays as Robin- son did. The heart of the book, almost two thirds of the total pages, is a master table of the popular vote in each state by counties. Other subsidiary tables present selected information summarized from the master table.</page><page sequence="2">752 THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY HISTORICAL REVIEW Finally, there is an appendix that gives the source of returns, changes in county structure, and information about special cases where figures are miss- ing, incomplete, or conflicting. After examining Burnham's figures, those who have been generalizing will undoubtedly be more cautious. What emerges from these pages is a con- stantly shifting, incredibly diverse picture that defies easy analysis. Some- times Burnham arrives at nation-wide totals that differ from usually ac- cepted totals. The figures will be raw material for many studies of regional and economic voting patterns. This work is so obviously the product of careful labor that minor criticisms are made reluctantly. First, it is a pity that Burnham did not begin with the earliest year for which any popular returns exist, even though the figures are spotty and uncertain. It would have been particularly interesting to have county returns, such as they are, for 1828 and 1832. Second, Burnham's emphasis is on major parties only. It is impossible to identify the vote cast for minor candidates and minor parties. Third, the addition of election maps would have made the statistics easier to interpret. Finally, for some reason this valuable source book has been published in an offset process with a cheap binding. The work ought to be in more durable form, for students of political history will want to keep it at their elbows for repeated reference. Colorado College WILLIAM R. HOCHMAN</page></plain_text>
