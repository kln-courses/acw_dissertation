LOUIS</page><page sequence="2">CYCLADIC AND MYCENAEAN FIGURINES A CYCLADIC FIGURINE Small statuettes made of local marble and now known as the Cycladic figurines are the characteristic products of the people of the Cyclades1 of the Early Bronze Age. They stand at the beginning almost2 of the Greek achievement and at the head of a long list of works of art which later came to include the masterpieces of Phidias, of Praxiteles and of others. An out- standing example of this group of figurines was obtained by the Museum in 1954 (Figures 1 and 2).3 It belongs to the variety known as anthropo- morphic and is distinguished from the other known examples by its size. The Museum figurine, Accession No. 34:54, is 39 cm. in height, but since its feet are broken off, originally it must have measured at least 45 cm. The average height of such figurines is c. 25 cm.; the largest figurine of this type known to me, from the island of Amorgos now in the National Museum at Athens, measures five feet in height; but that is a unique and unparalleled example. The greatest width across the shoulders of our example amounts to 14 cm., while the maximum thickness of the stone used in its modelling is only 3.9 cm. It is made of coarse-grained island marble, exhibiting today brown and black stains, and it is in an excellent state of preservation. Besides the feet, only small chips are missing from the left knee area, the left arm and the right shoulder and arm. A clean break around the right knee and a break about the middle of the neck are noticeable in the figure. The latter caused the marble around it to splinter, but fortunately all the fragments were preserved and were reset in their original position by Mr. Joseph Ternbach of New York, who put the statuette together so admirably. The figurine represents a woman in a typical and well-known stance: standing with hands folded in front of the chest, the left over the right. Anatomical details have been eliminated and the minimum of elements left; but they give a clear, well organized and distinct if not powerful picture of the human form; not of a human form, but of the human form, universal and impersonal. The figurine indeed lacks massiveness, but its contour line is sharp and clear as is usual in figures which have been conceived frontally. 1 The Cyclades are a group of islands of the Aegean arranged almost in a circle, hence the name, along the eastern coast of the Peloponnesus and Attica and at a comparatively short distance from them to the east. 2 Older still are female figurines made of stone and clay by the inhabitants of the Mainland of Greece and Crete in the New Stone Age. A few centuries at most separate the Stone Age from the Cycladic figurines. There are those who believe that the Cycladic evolved from the Neolithic statuettes, but there are so many differences between the two that I believe them to have developed independently of each other. On this subject cf. especially Weinberg, S., "Neolithic Figurines and Aegean Interrelations," A.J.A. 55 (1951), pp. 121-133 and Mylonas, G., Olynthus /, pp. 58-62. Cycladic figurines were found in Cretan tombs; there can be no doubt that these were imported from the islands. The notion that they were kept as heir- looms and treasured accordingly is not substantiated by the established facts. 3 To the Director of the Museum, Mr. Perry T; Rathbone, I am grateful for assigning to me the publication of these figurines. I am under deep obligation to Dr. Thomas T. Hoopes, Curator of the Museum, and to Miss Catherine Filsinger, his assistant, for placing at my disposal the records of the Museum and for their help in the study of the figurines. Volume XL 1955 Numbers Î¹ and 2 [ 2 ]</page><page sequence="3">Bulletin of the City Art Museum of St. Louis For it is evident that the female form represented is frontal and sym- metrical and exhibits a flatness typical of the Cycladic figurines. It is interesting to note that the sides are more or less rounded (Figure 2), that they do not present a sharp transition from the rear to the front plane, as is commonly the case in the older examples of the group. Only the tran- sition over the shoulders is rather sharp and their joints with the upper arms viewed from the rear give the impression of sharp-edged wings. The head, as usual, is flat and exhibits an upturned face terminated by a straight line on the top and above the low forehead and by a well-rounded chin below. It is dominated by a prominent nose, a trihedron c. 4.7 cm. long, projecting at its base around the nostrils c. .4 cm. from the surface. No other features of the face are indicated by modelling or scratching, but these may have been originally rendered in color which has disappeared in the intervening centuries. Tsountas, who was the first to discover Cycladic figurines in scientifically conducted excavations,4 found traces of color in a number of specimens and at least one of them, at the time of the discovery, still preserved a black dot representing the eye. The neck is long, 4 cm. in height, elliptical in section, flat in the back, slightly convex in front. The shoulders are broad, giving unusual width for a female form to the upper section of the torso, which rather sharply narrows to a small abdominal section and buttocks. In its upper part are placed, widely apart, the breasts indicating clearly the sex of the figurine. The arms and hands, across the chest and below the breasts, are slender, but slightly rounded and their contour is indicated by incised lines. The left hand is hidden below the right arm, while the right hand is worked so as to fit the contour of the rounded left side. The abdominal section is slightly convex and is terminated by the usual two incised lines in the form of F. The legs grow smoothly from the waist and are differentiated by a well-defined incision, both in front and in the rear. Their surface is slightly convex and presents a distinct sloping to the rounded side. A slight bend in the knee area is noticeable. It is regrettable that the feet are gone, but from the many other known examples they can be conceived with the metatarsal and toe areas rendered vertically and giving the impression of a figure standing on its toes. This, as well as the lack of suspension holes, proves that the figurines were intended to be laid flat on their backs and in that position they have been found in excavations. The rear side is entirely flat, and as a matter of fact the entire figurine exhibits a flatness characteristic of its type and class. It is reasonable to believe that the kind of material employed for the making of the figurine was responsible for this flatness, for the shape of the head, even for the feet raised on toes. Most of the Cycladic figurines appear to have been made 4 Ephemeris Jrchaeologike, 1898-1899, pp. 193-199. For the Amorgos example see Tsountas and Manatt, The Mycenaean Age, fig. 132. [3 1</page><page sequence="4">Bulletin of the City Art Museum of St. Louis from flat slabs with very small thickness, which would not allow rounding, depth or horizontal extension, but which would not require too much work and cutting away, a result hard to achieve in days when stone tools were still employed. It is generally agreed that the marble worker of that remote period depended on abrasion as his chief means of modelling with incision by harder stone as an accessory.5 An examination of the surface of our figurine will bear out this conclusion: there can be no doubt that by means of abrasion most of the modelling and the finishing of the surface was accomplished. Incised lines were made by harder stone; the deep incisions of the legs were made by both abrasion and the use of harder stone. In detail our specimen resembles the group of Cycladic figurines of the anthropomorphic variety.6 The circumstances of its discovery are unknown to us, but all the figurines found in the course of scientific excavations come from graves and formed part of the funereal furniture placed in them at the time of burial. We may therefore, with a good measure of confidence, con- clude that our example also was made to be placed in a grave. Archaeolo- gists agree on the period during which such figurines were produced: they were made and placed in graves in the Cyclades during the Early Bronze Age, which in terms of years can be figured to have lasted from c. 27001900 B. C. To those centuries our figurine must belong. Since we do not know the nature of the other objects found with it, which might have allowed us to date it more closely, it is impossible to narrow down the chronological limits indicated. My own personal belief, based on the data uncovered by the Washington University expedition at the site of Aghios Kosmas in 195 1, is that figurines of this type belong to the second half of the Bronze Age in the Cyclades. I would therefore place our statuette in the period beginning around 2400 B. C. and ending about 1900 B. C. The Cycladic figurines were used for the dead. Most of the anthro- pomorphic examples are female and, in form as well as in detail, are similar to our figurine. There are two specimens, however, that vary in an inter- esting and instructive way. One of them represents a woman carrying a child on her head, while the other a woman holding a child on her lap. Male figures are very rare. The most remarkable of these are a seated harp player and a standing flute player in the National Museum at Athens.7 Unfortunately, these musicians were not found in an excavation but were 5 cf. Casson, Stanley, The Technique of Early Greek Sculpture, pp. 15 ff. Wet sand and emery dust apparently were used for the rubbing process, while chips of emery, of obsidian and other hard stone seem to have been employed for incisions and cuts. 6 The other variety is the amorphous. In that we can scarcely recognize the human form. Often examples of the amorphous variety resemble fiddles and so they are called fiddle-shaped figurines. 7 Nos. 3908 and 3910. For good illustrations of these musicians cf. Casson, op. Â«7., figures 6 and 7. The same holds true for the representations of musicians in other museums, if those figurines could be proved to be genuine.

This problem centers around the meaning and the function of the figurines. For a long time scholars believed that the Cycladic female figurines were made in imitation of representations of some Oriental, Semitic Goddess of Fertility and that they represented such a Goddess. [ S I</page><page sequence="6">Bulletin of the City Art Museum of St. Louis This belief has now been abandoned because none of these Cycladic figurines â¢is represented with hands pressing its breasts, a feature characteristic of the Oriental Goddess of Fertility.8 Tsountas, long since, proved that they do not represent Astarte, but did not advance any other explanation for their existence. Sir Arthur Evans9 assumed them to be representations of slaves and wives upon whom depended the comfort of the deceased in the lower world. This suggestion was further exploited by D. G. Hogarth,10 who maintained that "the feminine funerary figurines of the Aegean area were intended to be human and to serve this or that sexual appetite of the dead," that "they were agents of magic, but not in any other sense cult- objects." Most recently our greatest authority on Greek religion, Professor Martin P. Nilsson, of the University of Lund, accepting this view of Evans and Hogarth, has declared that there is "no doubt concerning the interpre- tation of these figures; they are gifts to the dead designed to serve him in another world," and compared them to the Egyptian custom of placing figurines in the graves. "It is a means," he added, "of providing the dead with all his needs, including servants, concubines, and musicians, on the principle that the image does the same service as the original.11 I do not agree with this interpretation of Evans, Hogarth, Nilsson and their followers. We may first point out with Charles Picard, that with very, very few exceptions the Cycladic figurines found in graves are female; if they were representations of concubines the graves in which they were found must have belonged to men. Why then are not male figurines found in the graves of women? We must remember that in the Early Bronze Age women had a high status in the social order, since even the supreme deity of the people was female and that women must have been equally anxious to secure comfort in the lower world. We must further note that such figurines were found only in some graves, while most of them contained a variety of objects but no figurines. This custom provides us with a decisive fact which will be fully explained in our discussion of the Mycenaean figurines - a fact that proves untenable the view of Evans, Hogarth and Nilsson. The nudity of the figurines has perhaps contributed to the im- pression of their presence for sexual ends. However, nudity may be attribu- ted to the inability of the artist to represent a draped form and to his reduction of that form to the minimum of detail. This is not unusual in primitive art. Furthermore, Tsountas found color on the surface of a number of figurines. It is possible to assume that by means of color drapery was indicated, as is the case in the later Mycenaean figurines, color which 8 Picard, Ch., "Oushabti Ã©gÃ©ens," Rev. des Ã©tudes anciennes, 32 (1930) p. 97 ff., Nilsson, M.P., The Minoan-Mycenaean Religion and its Survival in Greek Religion, second ed. p. 293. 9 Cretan Pictographs, pp. 130-13 1. 10 Essays in Aegean Archaeology Presented to Sir Arthur Evans, p. 55 ff. 11 Nilsson, op. cit., pp. 293-294. 16]</page><page sequence="7">Bulletin of the City Art Museum of St. Louis has disappeared in the course of centuries. Certainly the nudity has nothing to do with the real function of the figurines. Picard believes that the Cycladic figurines represent a chthonic Mother Goddess. The position of the hands across the chest, however, seems to indicate a respectful, alert attitude incompatible with the character of the Mother Goddess. I believe Cycladic figurines, like some of the Mycenaean, represent divine figures, maybe nurses, and not slaves or concubines. To avoid duplication I shall give below, and in the section dealing with Mycenaean figurines, the reasons for such a belief. Meanwhile, once more we must draw attention to the direct and simple way in which the artists of the Cycladic figurines modelled the human form, to their ability for selection and elimination, for organization and synthesis, to qualities that contribute so much to the effect of these products of one of the oldest known sculpture-workshops of the Hellenic world. MYCENAEAN FIGURINES In the Mainland ot Greece and in Late Mycenaean times, around 1300 B. C, figurines of clay make their appearance and become very char- acteristic of the artistic activity of the last two centuries of the Mycenaean period and culture. The majority of these figurines are female; a good number of them, however, represent animals and some even chariots. In 1954 two female figurines and one representing a horned quadruped were obtained by the Museum. All belong to well known and very common types.12 Figurine No. 116:51 (Figure 3a) excellently preserved, is made of light buff clay, well levigated and fired, and covered with a smooth, well-polished slip of the same color. It stands 11.5 cm. in height and its maximum width across the top of the wing-like projections of the shoulders amounts to 6 cm. The figurine belongs to the well-known Î¨ type and as usual stands on a cylindrical lower part, 4.9 cm. in height, terminating in a circular concave base about 2.8 cm. in diameter. The torso is flat and in the form of a sickle, with breasts indicated by small pointed convexes. The head is flat on top and pinched in front to form a prominent beak-like nose on either side of which the eyes have been indicated by two large round dots. Thus the face gives to the figurine a weird, bird-like appearance. The head is covered by a Stephane or wreath from the rear edge of which emerges a 12 The clay Mycenaean figurines were first distinguished in types by Tsountas, Ephemeris Archaeologike, 1888, pp. 168-169 and then by Biegen, C.W., Zygouries, pp. 203-205 and Prosymna, pp. 355-360; and by Wace, A.J.B., Chamber Tombs at Mycenae, pp. 215-217; and lately by Furutnark, Î., The Chronology of Mycenaean Pottery, pp. 86-89. [ 7 ]</page><page sequence="8">Bulletin of the City Art Museum of St. Louis rectangular, thin and narrow plastic band that is continued to the back of the neck. It may represent a braid or even, as Demangel, Holland and Harland have suggested, a serpent. The front and the rear of the figurine are covered with a linear decoration painted in the characteristic brilliant brown-black Mycenaean color. The Stephane is covered with solid color projected over the edge of the nose. A band is placed around the neck from which are suspended parallel, wavy, stripes covering the entire torso and its wing-like projections, terminating at the waist and at a belt-like stripe going around the figurine. From that are suspended vertical parallel bands - one in front, one on each side and one in the rear - reaching to the edge of the foot. There can be little doubt that at least the wavy stripes covering the torso stand for a garment that is supposed to have covered the figurine. Figurine No. 1 17.51 (Figure 3b) is also made of light buff clay covered with a smooth coat of well polished slip of the same color. It belongs to a type different than that to which our first figurine belongs, to type Î¦, and measures 11.8 cm. in height and 4.1 cm. in maximum width across the breasts. It also exhibits a cylindrical lower part terminating in a conical, concave base; however the cylindrical part is shorter, measuring only 4.2 cm. in height. The torso is oval, disc shaped, exhibiting, as it is usual in this type, no indication of hands, but prominent breasts which establish the sex of the figurine. The neck is hardly differentiated from the face, which again was produced by pinching in the clay before firing. Thus the beak-like nose is prominent, giving a bird like appearance to the face. The head on top is triangular and flat and from its rear end issues and is con- tinued to the waist a narrow and thin plastic band decorated vertically by parallel dots. The decoration is similar to that of our first figurine and is painted in the same brilliant brown-black color. However, around the neck of the second figurine is painted a necklace, with its beads clearly indicated. Only a chip from the left side of the foot is missing. Figurine No. 115.51 (Figure 3c) is a typical Mycenaean representation of a horned, four-legged animal. It is made of buff-yellowish clay, covered with a slip of the same color and is decorated by stripes painted in brilliant brown-black color. Its maximum length is 1 1 cm. and its maximum height 8.2 cm. It stands solidly on its four rounded legs that open outwardly and exhibits an elongated cylindrical body and a long-muzzled head crowned by long horns, connected over the forehead in a sweeping curve. The painted decoration consists of broad, almost parallel stripes placed hori- zontally and vertically in an unrealistic but pleasantly naive manner. It will not be necessary to point out the charm which these figurines emanate. The conscious, but firm stylization which they, exhibit, the sub- stitution of the cylindrical stand for the lower part of the body, the sim- plicity of the contours, the bird-like features of the face, the elimination of hands or their transformation into wing-like projections, the elongated [ 8 ]</page><page sequence="9">Bulletin of the City Art Museum of St. Louis shape of the body of the animal that contrasts with its straight, unbending legs and the sweeping curve of its horns, all these characteristics impart a naive but sincere feeling that pleasantly impresses the spectator and relates to him a sense of satisfaction, a child-like satisfaction mixed with intellec- tual delight. These qualities will place the humble products under dis- cussion among the more pleasing creations of the Mycenaean potter. They are indeed favorites with the field archaeologist, who considers them as the harbingers of better finds to come and bringers of good luck. Archaeologists are in agreement as to the general date of these figurines. They were made and used during the last two centuries of the Mycenaean era, from about 1300 B. C. to about 1100 B. C. They also agree that they are the characteristic products of the Mainland of Greece and that they appear completely developed around 1300 B. C. But they disagree as to the meaning and function of these figurines. A good number of them, belonging to both types illustrated by our examples, as well as figures of animals, were found in Mycenaean houses and in sanctuaries. Schliemann alone found over two hundred of them in the citadels of Mycenae and Tiryns13 and among the sanctuaries we can mention Delphi, where the French excavators brought to light an impres- sive number in the Marmaria district.14 There can be little doubt that the female figurines found in shrines were either votive offerings or repre- sentations of a divinity. The figurines of type Î¨, our figure 3a, certainly are representations of a divinity and their type can be traced back to the Minoan Goddess with raised arms, in the well-known gesture of bene- diction.15 This conclusion is strengthened by the discovery of such figurines in the well-attested shrine of Asine.16 Figurines of type Î¦, our figure 3b, could be considered as votaries, while the animal forms as votive offerings. However, figurines of the same types are also found in Mycenaean graves, not in all the graves but in a good number. We cannot know whether our examples were found in a house or in a shrine or in a grave. In all probability they were found in a grave. The meaning and function of the Mycenaean figurines found in graves have been the subject of a long controversy. The late Axel W. Persson, applying Evans' and Hogarth's interpretation of the Cycladic figurines to the Mycenaean, maintained that the latter were gifts to the dead, substitutes of wives, concubines and slaves and compared them to the Ushebtis of the Egyptians.17 Nilsson, 13 Schliemann, H., Mycenae, pl. XIX and p. 71. He identified the female statuettes as Hera. 14 Demangel, R., Fouilles de Delphes, 11:3 Le Sanctuaire d'AthÃªna Pronaia, pp. 5-36. cf.

[9 Î¹</page><page sequence="10">Bulletin of the City Art Museum of St. Louis supporting Persson, has taught that "the same interpretation will hold good here as for the Gycladic idols; they are gifts to the dead." Empha- sizing one of Tsountas' observations, Nilsson has added further that "it is very characteristic that these idols are found most abundantly in the poorer graves. Anyone who was unable to procure jewelry and costly things, thought to make up for the want by these cheap figures which, however, it was imagined would procure a luxurious afterlife for the man who had not known but work and necessity in this life."18 If we accept this view, for both the Mycenaean and the Cycladic figurines it will be hard to account for their discovery in only a few graves. Man, in the past as today, was anxious to secure the best for himself and to insure a comfortable life either in this or in the next world if he believes in the existence of a next world. If a few, inexpensive figurines were capable of insuring happiness and comfort in the lower world, human beings, both men and women, rich and poor, would naturally have included them among the objects to be placed in their graves. As a result they would be found in all and not in a comparatively few sepulchres. That rich people did not object to such an inclusion is proved by the fact that in some rich graves figurines were found. Certainly a belief other than that stated by Persson and Nilsson must have prompted their deposition in a grave, and upon that belief their interpretation must depend. That it was not a belief similar to that which prompted the action of the Egyptians and the placing of the Ushebtis in graves we believe can easily be proved. If we maintain that the Mycenaean and the Cycladic figurines correspond to the Ushebtis of the Egyptians, then we must prove that the Aegean and the Egyptian ideas of what happens when death puts an end to life on this earth must of necessity be the same or parallel. Our know- ledge of the ideas of the people of the Cyclades in the Early Bronze Age and of their conception of the lower world is too vague and incomplete to allow us to make a comparison that will be valid. But our knowledge of the Mycenaean burial customs and of their conceptions of what happens after death is quite extensive if not complete and we believe adequate for our purpose.19 All available evidence to date seems to prove that these ideas and conceptions were diametrically different; that the Mycenaeans did not believe that after death life continued in another world, be it the lower or Hades or Elysium, in the same or similar way as on earth with the same or similar needs that had to be provided for as the Egyptians believed. Like the Homeric heroes, the Mycenaeans seem to have believed that once flesh had dissolved the "spirit" descended into the "World of Shadows", where it stayed without clear self-consciousness, neither feeling nor desiring anything. All its associations with the world of the living were then ended 18 Nilsson, M., op. cit., pp. 307-308. 19 cf. Mylonas, G., "Homeric and Mycenaean Burial Customs," A.J.A. 52 (1948) pp. 56-81. [ Î¯Î¿]</page><page sequence="11">Bulletin of the City Art Museum of St. Louis and there was no coming back to that world in which the "spirit" had no longer either influence or interest. For people with such conceptions, slaves, concubines, and wives to serve them in the hereafter were of no value. And then what about the women ? Were the women of the poorer classes, who in life must have suffered more than men, to be denied the comforts of afterlife, since no male figurines have yet been found in graves of women ? Furthermore, if figurines of the Î¨ type found in sanctuaries represent a divinity, we have to explain why the same type was used for the repre- sentation of a Goddess on the one hand and a slave or a concubine on the other. We may now observe that Biegen has pointed out that in the cemetery of Prosymna such figurines were found in graves of children.20 His obser- vations were verified by us at Eleusis. In that site the Washington Uni- versity expedition brought to light at least four intact child burials of the Late Mycenaean period. In each of them female figurines of the Î¨ and Î¦ types formed part of the furnishings and they were found in the original position in which they were laid some three thousand years ago. Similarly, figurines were found in the child burials uncovered by Dr. John Papa- demetriou and the Greek Archaeological Society in Attica and Nauplia. It seems then that these figurines formed characteristic gifts of child burials. It will be rather strange to maintain that representations of con- cubines were placed in the graves of children. We could even reject the suggestion that they may have represented the mother of the deceased, because of the variety of the types and because of the impossibility of placing in a grave the form of a living being. We may also remark that the available observations of excavators are inadequate to prove either that figurines were found with the remains of adults or that they have been found only in graves of children. Future excavations should determine the point. But for the time being it is safe to accept the conclusion that such figurines have been found in child burials and that they form a characteristic type of gift placed in graves of children. Professor Biegen suggested that some of these figurines were toys; and some, like the representations of chariots, may well have been toys. But the female figurines must have served another purpose. We believe that the evidence available seems to indicate that these figurines found in graves have a divine character. Those of the Î¨ type (Figure 3a) represent a Goddess. Her upraised arms, stylized to look almost like upraised wings, will indicate that she is the Goddess of benediction and blessing. Figurines of type Î¦, (Figure 3b) most probably are representations of divine nurses to whose care the children were entrusted until they reached the realm of 20 PrÃ²symna, p. 253. The figurines published by Professor David M. Robinson, J.J.J. (54 (1950) , p. 1 ff., seem to have come from child burials, if we could judge from the pottery which is reported to have been found with them. The examples found by Wace and Persson in Mycenae and Asine do not provide definite evidence. [ Â» ]</page><page sequence="12">Bulletin of the City Art Museum of St. Louis Hades. This interpretation of figurines of type Î¦ is strengthened by two interesting figurines found in graves some sixty years apart and now in the National Museum at Athens. The first, found by Tsountas at Mycenae in 1893, 1S rnade up of two figurines, of type Î¦, joined at the side like Siamese twins.21 Over their common shoulder a child is seated. The second, und in the spring of 1954 ky Dr. Papademetriou, is composed of similar figures joined at the side with a child between them. There can be no doubt that these female figures were supposed to take care of the child held by them. And the interpretation receives additional support from other figurines representing a woman holding a baby in her arm, the so- called kourotrophoi. The figures of animals placed in graves were perhaps intended, as Biegen suggested, to insure a good supply of milk. Granted that figurines of type Î¨ represent a Goddess and figurines of type Î¦ a divine nurse, the question could be advanced: why were they placed in graves of children? I think that the available to date evidence proves that the funereal gear placed in Mycenaean graves was to serve the deceased in his trip to the "World of Shadows" and not in that world. For otherwise it will remain unexplained why this gear was scattered, broken and even stolen after the flesh of the deceased had dissolved and the body was transformed into a bundle of bones. It seems that it was further believed that the trip lasted until the flesh had dissolved, that then the spirit was believed to have reached the "Realm of Shadows". The trip was long and perhaps hazardous, but the grown-up could negotiate it without difficulty. The case was different for small children. They were carefully tended by their parents while living. All of a sudden that bond was broken by death and the small children were left to themselves to face the long and un- certain trip. It was natural for their parents and friends to feel that these small children, pathetically left to themselves so abruptly to face the unknown, were in need of assistance and to develop the belief that the figurines would provide that assistance. The children were placed under the protection of the Goddess of benediction and blessing, figurines of type Î¨, and in the care of divine nurses, figurines of type Î¦, who were to attend to their needs during the long trip and see them safely to the lower world. After that was reached the figurines were of no further use and so we find them often swept aside and no longer with the remains of the children at whose side they were placed originally. This interpretation of the figurines will also explain why they are found in some graves only, and why they are mostly found in the poorer graves; because they were placed only in graves of children, which form but a percentage of the total number of tombs found, and because as a rule children's graves do not contain as rich and elaborate funereal gear as the graves of the adults. 21 Athens, No. 3230. The example found by Dr. Papademetriou has not been catalogued as yet nor an accession number has been given to it. [ 12]</page><page sequence="13">Figure 3a Figure 3b Figure 3c Professor Nilsson's suggestion that the Cycladic idols, as he calls them, served the same purpose as that served by the Mycenaean figurines is a sound one. I would therefore suggest that the Cycladic female figurines also represent divine nurses, and this interpretation seems to be strength- ened by the two specimens representing women holding a child. Unfor- tunately we cannot know whether the Cycladic figurines, or any of them, were found in graves of children. This is left to be determined by future excavations of Cycladic graves and should form one of the objectives of future investigations. We may incidentally mention how prevalent is the tradition of divine nurses taking care of Olympian Gods and heroes in historic times, a tradition which may go back to the Mycenaean female figurines. Could we advance our probe a step further and try to determine whether or not there exists a relation between the Cycladic and Mycenaean figurines as artistic forms? In other words, could we maintain that the latter evolved from the former? It is certain that the Mycenaean figurines appear sud- denly in a developed form that must have evolved from earlier prototypes. But as Nilsson has pointed out, the two groups of figurines are separated by a gap of many years, even of centuries. As long as that gap remains unbreached, and this is the situation today, we shall be unable to prove or to maintain that the Mycenaean figurines evolved from the Cycladic. We may, however, point out that figurines of type Î¦, at least their torsos, could have developed from those of the anthropomorphic Cycladic figurines. The atrophied arms and hands of the latter could have been eliminated completely to form our type Î¦. And then such atrophied hands are to be [ 13 ]</page><page sequence="14">Bulletin of the City Art Museum of St. Louis seen in some of the kourotrophoi and in Mycenaean figurines represented with hands across the lower part of the chest, type Î. However, definite conclusions on the matter are impossible at present. Our discussion, we believe, has brought forth definite suggestions as to the meaning and function of the Mycenaean and Cycladic figurines. Mycenaean figurines of type Î¨, our figure 3a, when found in shrines rep- resent cult idols of the Goddess. Figurines of type Î¦, our figure 3b, when found in shrines represent votaries, while animal forms are votive offerings . When found in children's graves, figurines of type Î¨, our figure 3 a, again represent the Goddess of blessing or benediction, under whose protection a child was placed; figurines of type Î¦, our figure 3b, are representations of divine nurses in whose care the child was left while those representing bovine figures are there to insure the milk supply in the course of the trip to the lower world. The Cycladic figurines also may be conceived as repre- sentations of divine nurses or beings in whose care the deceased was left. The meaning and function of the figurines, both Cycladic and Mycena- ean, in the collection of the Museum can thus be suggested. Whether or not we accept the suggested interpretation, however, these figurines from the third and second millennia B. C, respectively, are still significant works of the minor artists of the prehistoric world, that stand at the beginning of the so-called Greek achievement, and are capable of imparting a good deal of satisfaction and inspiration to a modern thoughtful observer.
