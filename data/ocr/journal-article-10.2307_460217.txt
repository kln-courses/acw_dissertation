<plain_text><page sequence="1">MONTAIGNE ON THE DIGNITY OF MAN By Abraham C. Keller THE QUESTION of the dignity of man and his place in the universe was much discussed in the Renaissance. With an infiated idea of their departure from medieval tradition,1 the thinkers of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries tried hard to arrive at a new, "humanistic," evalua? tion of man. We know now, of course, that their departure was not as sharp as they thought and that certain traditional arguments persisted in one form or another. Herschel Baker, in his study, The Dignity of Man, published in 1947, showed the persistence of some themes and the intro? duction of others, especially in the Neoplatonic and Protestant thinkers. It is the purpose of this article to examine the way in which the question was handled by Montaigne, who was up to date in his readings on the subject and who had the advantage of coming at the end of the Conti- nental Renaissance; to determine the extent of his departure from tradi? tion, the paths which he followed in his thinking, and the degree of independence which he exercised. Since man is the central subject of the Essais, Montaigne's opinions are likely to be well thought out and care- fully formulated. The material presented here can hardly be new; it is the sweep and originality of Montaigne's views that need to be pointed out.2 What impression we get of Montaigne's ideas on the dignity of man depends on what essays or parts of essays we read. Yet it is safe to say that on the whole?difficult though that is to specify?Montaigne be? lieved in man's worth. There is an unmistakably positive message in the essays, and certainly by the time we have finished reading Book iii we can hardly fail to get the impression that, in spite of serious and sub- stantial weaknesses and Montaigne's frequent denigration, the human being is worth while. No one is likely to feel he is in the presence of a tale full of sound and fury signifying nothing. Not only did Montaigne con? sider the human being capable of lofty achievement and elevated stature, as his interest in the character and accomplishments of great men shows, but he even considered more "average" men like himself capable of fine things. There is no soul, he wrote, "si chetifve et brutale en laquelle on 1 Rabelais' Bk. n, Ch. viii is fairly typical.

Simone, "La Coscienza della Rinascita negli Umanisti," Rinascita, ii (1939), 838-871. 1 References to Montaigne's essays are to the Bibliothique de la PUiade edition (Paris, 1950).

He started, like many serious writers, with a desire to discover how ordinary human beings can be made into heroes on the model of the world's great?which explains his love of history and the special place which he assigned to Plutarch in his educational system. But gradually Montaigne lost hope and even interest in the idea of making men into giants. He found it more real and more appealing to make his giants into men and ended by finding the worth of the human person exemplified much more in the run-of-the-mill citizen whose modest feats are solidly grounded in human strength and weakness, than in the hero whose world- shaking deeds are inspired by miraculous bursts and divine flashes, which are no true measure of the worth or power of men.8 Traditionally, before Montaigne's time, it was customary for those who reasoned on the dignity of man (and believed in it) to support their affirmative conclusions with one or more of three standard arguments. In the first place, it was widely argued that man, unlike other creatures, has an immortal soul which places him in a privileged relationship to God and gives him bright promise for the future, and that therein lies the secret of his worth. This was at the bottom of the Biblical, or Chris? tian, view of man, and though it seldom appears in this nude form in Renaissance thinkers, it does appear clearly as one of the supports for man's dignity. According to this view, the key to man's worth is his closeness to God. "He will end," as Reinhold Niebuhr explains it, "by seeking absorption in a divine reality which is at once all and nothing. To understand himself truly means to begin with a faith that he is understood from beyond himself, that he is known and loved of God and must find himself in terms of obedience to the divine will."4 Even when, as in Pico della Mirandola, something other than divinity is made the source of man's greatness, his closeness to God is adduced as both a spur to the fullest human realization and a goal of human en- deavor.6 * See the opening sentences of Bk. n, Ch. xxix of the Essays, with this important addi" tion made by Montaigne at the end of his career: "Sauf l'ordre, la moderation et la constance, j'estime que toutes choses sont faisables par un homme bien manque" et deffail- lant en gros." 4 The Nature and Destiny of Man, 2 vols. (New York and London, 1941-42), i, 15. ? "Let us, lest we speak more of other things than of ourselves, take care that, while we scratinize the heights, we do not live too basely, in a manner unworthy of beings to whom has been given the divine power of inquiring into things divine. We ought, then, to consider assiduously that our mind, with its divine privileges, cannot have a mortal origin nor can</page><page sequence="3">Abraham C. Keller 45 The second traditional argument purporting to establish man's dignity rested on his power of reason. By his intellect, in this view, man can attain to heights of knowledge and understanding unequalled by other creatures, and in that power of knowledge his dignity principally resides. Generally regarded as the "classical view" because it was typical of much of ancient philosophy, this idea naturally occupied a large place in Ren? aissance speculation on man. Knowledge might be entirely this-worldly and therefore eventually, by the time of Bacon and Descartes, scientific, as it had been with the Epicureans in earlier times; or it might, as in Vives and others, become an evidence of divinity, the unifying force between God and man.8 The third great argument for the dignity of man?man's freedom? was singled out by Pico in his famous Oration on the Dignity of Man, and has come to be regarded as most characteristic of Renaissance thinking. "We have made thee neither of heaven nor of earth," Pico quotes God as saying to man, "neither mortal nor immortal, so that with freedom of choice and with honor, as though the maker and molder of thyself, thou mayest fashion thyself in whatever shape thou shalt prefer. Thou shalt have the power to degenerate into the lower forms of life, which are brutish. Thou shalt have the power, out of thy soul's judgment, to be reborn into the higher forms, which are divine."7 Stemming in large part, no doubt, from the Christian conception, this emphasis on man's freedom of choice undoubtedly took on a new importance in the Ren? aissance because of the emphasis on strong individuals and assumed large proportions in such nontheological thinkers as Pomponazzi and Machiavelli. It must be stressed that these three ennobling qualities in man? divinity, intellect, and free will?were seldom separated in any rigid manner or presented singly. The old Epicurean insistence on intellect alone as man's saving grace was exceptional. The Christian combination of divinity and free will and the juxtaposition, like Pomponazzi's, of find happiness otherwise than in the possession of things divine, and that the more it elevates and inflames itself with the contemplation of the Divine by renouncing earthly preoccupations while yet a traveller on this pilgrimage here below, the more it will approach felicity. The best precept, then, which this discussion can give us, seems to be that, if we wish to be happy, we ought to imitate the most happy and blessed of all beings, God, by establishing in ourselves unity, truth, and goodness" (DeEnte et Uno, trans. V. M. Hamm, Milwaukee, 1943, Ch. X, p. 33). ? See Vives* Fabula de homine, in Opera Omnia, rv (trans. Nancy Lenkeith in The Renais? sance Philosophy of Man, ed. Cassirer et al.).

Forbes, in Cassirer et al., p. 225.</page><page sequence="4">46 Montaigne on the Dignity of Man free will and intellect8 are much more typical. Very commonly, of course, man's godlike quality is the proof of his worth, and that godlike quality is established by either the power of his mind or by his free will, or by both.9 Generally speaking, no one of man's three great gifts was felt to be adequate. Free will especially would be virtually inconceivable as man's dignifying quality if unsupported by reason or closeness to God, for it would fail to carry with it that guarantee of proper use which alone gives the doctrine of free will its enormous power and appeal. II Where, now, did Montaigne stand with regard to these arguments traditionally used to support the idea of the dignity of man? Divinity, or anything having to do with the immortal soul, as proof of man's dignity never appealed to him. Though he respected this belief when he saw it in others and sometimes even expressed the wish that he might be so spiritually inclined, his temperament prevented him from ever, in his long career, making much of it in his construction of a system of values.10 It is true that here and there Montaigne appears to associate man's dignity, or "honor," with divinity, as when he says, early in the Apologie: "Considerons donq pour cette heure l'homme seul, sans secours estranger, arme* seulement de ses armes, et despourveu de la grace et cognoissance divine, qui est tout son honneur, sa force et le fondement de son estre" (ii, xii, 494, A). However, far from bearing fruit in Mon? taigne's later writings, this identification of man's worth with divine grace and knowledge is hardly visible even in the Apologie, except as a hypothesis of the briefest duration. Free will as a ground for believing in the dignity of man may be as quickly disposed of. The large role of fortune in our lives and the dominion of the emotions over our actions would seem to leave little room for the operation of free will, and the latter does, in fact, assume no great importance in the Essais, though it is occasionally mentioned.11 ? Ibid., p. 304. 9 An excellent demonstration of the intermingling of these 3 themes in the Middle Ages appears in the course of Garin's article, "La 'Dignitas Hominis' e la letteratura patristica," Rinascita, i (1938), 102-146. 10 "Cette seule fin d'une autre vie heureusement immortelle, merite loyalement que nous abandonnons les commoditez et douceurs de cette vie nostre. Et qui peut embraser son ame de Pardeur de cette vive foy et esperance, reellement et constamment, il se bastit en la solitude une vie voluptueuse et delicate au dela de toute autre forme de vie ... Les gens plus sages peuvent se forger un repos tout spirituel, ayant Pame forte et vigoureuse. Moy qui Pay commune, il faut que j'ayde a me soutenir par les commoditez corporelles ..." (i, xxxix, 283, C). 11 Montaigne seems to accept Catholic theology in the matter of free will (see n, xxix, 794, A), but it never became an integral part of his thinking.</page><page sequence="5">Abraham C. Keller 47 The question of reason is less simple. Here, at least two periods may be distinguished in Montaigne's thinking, which are at the same time the first two periods in his thinking on human dignity in general. In his early period, which has to be taken to include the years before he began to write essays as well as the first few years of his writing career, Mon? taigne appears to have considered reason central to man's stature. Up to about 1575, such regard as he had for man's worth was due to the power of the mind, which included man's control over his passions through the medium of his understanding of duty, virtue, pain, and the like. The early essays in the Stoic manner are evidence of this point of view,12 but even more convincing is Montaigne's interest in and apparent agreement with Raymond Sebond, whom he probably read as early as 1560 or thereabouts and who set great store by man's reasoning power. From the vantage point of the last essays, this position seems foreign to Montaigne and his temperament.13 It is as though he had intellectually decided to adopt it (under the infiuence of Seneca and Lucretius), with? out reference to its particular suitability to him. However the case may be, it was a position to which he early became committed and from which he had to use some violence to liberate himself. The change in Montaigne's views with regard to the power of intellect coincides with the transformation of his attitude toward the dignity of man?which is what we should expect, reason having been so closely associated with the dignity of man. It was in his second period, about 1575 (or earlier) to 1578, dominated by the Apologie de Raimond Sebond, that Montaigne administered his famous beating to man's power of reason, or intellect, as well as to his ideas of dignity altogether. We have been justly cautioned by many Montaigne students not to regard his attack on reason as an end in itself, but rather as part of a larger aim in the period of the Apologie, which was to destroy man's presumption.14 In order to accomplish this negative task, he had to take up, one by one, the various claims which had been made for man's dignity, and reason, being one of the foremost, naturally took rough treatment at Montaigne's hands. It seems certain that his extravagant attacks on reason in the Apologie are designed to hammer home his point of man's weakness, not to deny the uses of human intelligence. In the sense of a force with which 11 Bk. ii, Chs. i and ii are fair examples. 18 D. M. Frame points out, with good evidence, that by the time he translated Sebond (1569), Montaigne already had serious reservations about this author ("Did Montaigne Betray Sebond?" R.R.t xxxvni (1947), 297-329). 14 He speaks of "froisser et fouler aux pieds Porgueil et humaine fiert6; leur faire sentir i'inanite', la vanite* et deneantise de Phomme; leur arracher des points les chetives armes de leur raison; leur faire baisser la teste et mordre la terre soubs Pauthorite" et reverance de la majeste* divine" (n, xii, 493, A). His many references to "cette miserable et chetive creature" are too well known to require repetition.</page><page sequence="6">48 Montaigne on the Dignity of Man to organize one's life, reason never lost its value or importance for Montaigne. As Jacob Zeitlin said, "to maintain that human intelligence is imperfect and that our very best knowledge is based on uncertain foundations is quite a different thing from repudiating and denouncing the operations of the mind."15 Indeed, even in this period of the Apologie Montaigne considered reason?in the sense of judgment, not learning? a key to man's distinctive worth. Reason, he said, should at all times serve as a regulator of our natural impulses: "Puisqu'il a pleu a Dieu nous douer de quelque capacite de discours, affin que, comme les bestes, nous ne fussions pas servilement assujectis aux loix communes, ains que nous nous appliquassions par jugement et liberte volontaire, nous devons bien prester un peu a la simple authorite de nature, mais non pas nous laisser tyranniquement emporter a elle, la seule raison doit avoir la conduite de nos inclinations" (n, viii, 424, A). It is man's exalted idea of his stature, and not intellect per se, that Montaigne attacked at this time, especially in the Apologie. Now, having in this middle period run man down, or at least annihi- lated the principal grounds on which his high opinion of himself was based, Montaigne began, in the late 1570's but especially in the essays of Book in and the many additions to earlier essays, to expound a philosophy expressing the highest possible opinion of man. It is doubtful whether he would have written after 1586 what he wrote earlier: that, of ancient opinions on man, he favored those which abased him (n, xvii, 715, A).16 The essays of Book iii usher in a new "follow Nature" period? not the Stoic "follow Nature" idea, with its arbitrary conceptions of what nature is, but the fluid idea of following one's own inclinations and developing one's own potentialities in the most independent manner. This is the period in which Montaigne's values have become so inter- nalized that man is free of practically all arbitrary notions of virtue, glory, conscience, and nature. Montaigne's aim is to free man from all these restraints so that he may the more completely express and be himself. His belief in individuality, as that belief appears in Book iii and in the posthumous additions to the earlier books (e.g., in ii, xvi), is virtually without parallel in his time. Even as early as the late 1570's, in "De l'institution des enfants," for example, the whole emphasis on the fullest development of each individual appears unmistakably. And there is no doubt, in his praise of individuality, about his underlying faith in man and his possibilities. Indeed, Montaigne could hardly exhort ? Trans. The Essays of Michel de Montaigne, 3 vols. (New York, 1934-36), n, 503. M Bk. n, Ch. xi (probably written about 1578) is illustrative of Montaigne's transition period. He still expresses his old, Stoic, view of virtue, but his preference is clearly for the conception typical of his later years.

Montaigne's new philosophy, in its judgment of man, bears some re? semblance to his early views, with their basic idea of worth in man and his possibility of greatness. But the resemblance is all superficial. In his early period he was borrowing ideas and phrases; in his late period he has worked out an independent philosophy, which?no matter how much it might resemble others-?was truly his own. III The finest fruits of what Montaigne himself regarded as his new philos? ophy17 appeared after 1586, in the essays of Book iii and the extensive additions to all the essays. His total estimate of man had undergone a profound change, and the belief in man which we find in the writings after 1586 is like nothing that we find before. Out of the most negative writings before 1580, as if by an inner logic, there emerged a most sweep? ing formulation of man's worth. It is as though his recognition of man's weaknesses freed him to discern his merits. I do not mean that these periods in his thinking are rigid or that his late views came like a bolt out of the blue. On the contrary, for all their newness, there was a con? tinuity, almost an inevitability, about his new views of man. It is the easiest thing in the world to prove that in the Apologie Montaigne degraded man, but what is more important is, first of all, that in accomplishing that negative task he enunciated a principle which was pregnant with possibilities for his future thinking on human dignity, a principle whose constructive impact Montaigne realized but to which his students have never attached its full significance. In the second place, the continuity of his thought on man and the constructive outcome were both assured by the persistence of one important idea. This idea Mon? taigne carried over from the essays of his middle period, in which he questioned the dignity of man, into those of his final period, in which he was able to assert it on new and more positive grounds. These two fac? tors?(1) the principle which Montaigne enunciated even as he was doing his negative work in the Apologie, and (2) the idea which assured contin? uity in his thinking?we shall now examine. My first point concerns Montaigne's rejection of the idea of hierarchy. The importance of the Apologie in Montaigne's thought lies not so much in the fact that he cut down man's stature, or in his denial of the dignity of man, as in his rejection of the very grounds on which the discussion of dignity had been carried on. The term "dignity of man" seems almost 17 In a late passage, devoid of his frequent modesty, Montaigne speaks of "cette nouvelle lecon, que le prix et hauteur de la vraye vertu est en la facilitG, utilite* et plaisir de son exercice ..." (i, xxvi, 196, C).</page><page sequence="8">50 Montaigne on the Dignity of Man always to have implied an idea of comparison or rank?in antiquity, in the Middle Ages, and in the Renaissance. Man's worth was discussed in relation to God, or the cosmos, or lower animals, and man's place in the universe was of prime importance. The favorite form which these discussions took, of course, was a comparison to lower animals, and the favorite conclusion of Renaissance thinkers, influenced by Christian and Platonic ideas, was that man occupied a place between God and the beasts. The construction of a complete hierarchy, including angels and the rest, was one of the main concerns of the Neoplatonists, but the as? sumption of hierarchy runs through all the thinkers before Montaigne who have any positive conclusions about the wrorth and potentialities of man. Thinkers differing in other respects as sharply as Ficino and Pomponazzi had in common an acceptance of a hierarchical order in the universe. Though, as P. O. Kristeller has said, there are signs in these writers,18 and in Pico, of a breakdown of the hierarchical idea, that idea still informs their thinking. By contrast, Montaigne, with his denial of hierarchy, appears to have taken a bold and unusual step, re- jecting the old way of thinking not only in the cosmological but in the moral realm. Differences between creature and creature, between nation and nation, differences in physique, in function, in mores?all these he readily granted; but as for superiority, that he was loth to admit. Montaigne protested against comparisons and fanciful notions of what man or men are capable of. He was not interested in man's place in relation to other creatures, but only in the particular endowments of each. To say, for example, that some animals are armed for combat by "nature" whereas man's weapons are "unnatural" shows, in Montaigne's view, a narrow conception of nature: "Pourquoy ne dirons nous qu'il est aussi naturel de nous armer de bois et de fer?" (n, xii, 504, A). The idea of man's being "above" or "below" other creatures is one which Montaigne steadfastly refuses to discuss. After speaking of arms, and speech, he summarizes: "J'ay dit tout cecy pour maintenir cette ressem- blance qu'il y a aux choses humaines, et pour nous ramener et joindre au nombre. Nous ne sommes ny au dessus, ny au dessoubs du reste: tout ce qui est sous le Ciel, dit le sage, court une loy et fortune pareille . . . II y a quelque difference, il y a des ordres et des degrez; mais c'est soubs le visage d'une mesme nature ... II faut contraindre l'homme et le renger dans les barrieres de cette police" (n, xii, 506, A). And in another passage, written at about the same time (1575 or earlier), Montaigne says: "Ce defaut qui empesche la communication d'entre elles [les 18 "Fidno and Pomponazzi on the Place of Man in the Universe," JHI, v (1944), 220- 242.</page><page sequence="9">Abraham C. Keller 51 bestesj et nous, pourquoy n'est il aussi bien a nous qu'a elles? C'est a deviner, a qui est la faute ... II nous faut remarquer la parite* qui est entre nous" (n, xii, 498-499, A). The contention,in the late essays, and in late additions to earlier essays, is that each species and each individual must have its own standards and that comparisons are meaningless. The worth of an individual con- sists not in riding high, but fittingly. In his most mature period Mon? taigne wrote: "Le pris de l'ame ne consiste pas a aller haut, mais ordon- neement. Sa grandeur ne s'exerce pas en la grandeur, c'est en la medio- crite" (iii, ii, 905, B,C). And again: "La grandeur de l'ame n'est pas tant tirer a mont et tirer avant comme sgavoir se ranger et circonscrire. Elle tient pour grand tout ce qui est assez, et montre sa hauteur a aimer mieux les choses moyennes que les eminentes. II n'est rien si beau et legitime que de faire bien l'homme et deuement, ny science si ardue que de bien et naturellement sgavoir vivre cette vie; et de nos maladies la plus sauvage c'est mespriser nostre estre" (iii, xiii, 1250, C,B) For Montaigne, as for many modern artists and psychologists, the measure of worth is self-expression, and just as it is futile to say that a country where men bury their fathers is superior to one where they eat them, it is meaningless to say that men are superior to animals, or that one man operates on a more "lofty" plane than another, or that man is "lofty" at all. Montaigne denies the interest and validity of the whole discussion. The point is that nations, creatures, and individuals are dif? ferent from one another. In a late addition to Chapter xvi of Book n, one of a group of his mature essays written just before publication of the first edition in 1580, Montaigne wrote: "Toute la gloire que je pretends de ma vie, c'est de l'avoir vescue tranquille: tranquille non selon Metro- dorus, ou Arcesilas, ou Aristippus, mais selon moy. Puis que la philo- sophie n'a sgeu trouver aucune voye pour la tranquillite, qui fust bonne en commun, que chacun la cherche en son particulier" (ii, xvi, 702, C). If men can break through the various barriers enough to give scope to their abilities and interests, they are fulfilling their proper function in the universe. If this view does not sound like dignity in the older sense, in which standards were determined by men of great mind or great spirit, it nevertheless presents a much broader conception of human worth than Montaigne could find in the Neoplatonic or Protestant writers of the Renaissance. IV But, denying the validity of the question of dignity does not neces- sarily lead to a positive view. It was Montaigne's good fortune?and this is my second point?that his denial was accompanied by a positive idea</page><page sequence="10">52 Montaigne on the Dignity of Man which demanded that, after the denial, he must work out some real state? ment of human worth. This positive idea was Montaigne's optimism, which was of the most traditional stamp and which embraced the an? cient principle of order in the universe, a principle often associated with the dignity of man. But optimism, unlike divinity, free will, and reason, Montaigne accepted, and accepted from the beginning to the end of his writing career. Regarding the cosmic point of view, Montaigne was at all times a thoroughgoing optimist, believing that all things are the best possible in the largest sense (not, of course, that they are necessarily good from any human point of view).19 He was a solid believer in the plenitude of nature and the great chain of being?not a vertical chain of being with links from low to high as in Ficino, but rather a horizontal chain with links stretching across all creation. When he speaks of species of men different from us, or when, yielding to the common parlance of philos? ophy, he refers to creatures between men and beasts, he soon makes it clear that he is being descriptive only and that no judgment of worth is implied, since nature embraces all these forms equally (iii, xii, pp. 586-587, A, B). "Nature," he tells us in a passage written before 1580, "a embrasse universellement toutes ses creatures; et n'en est aucune qu'elle n'ait bien plainement fourny de tous moyens necessaires a la conservation de son estre" (n, xii, 502, A, and 586-587, A, B). He has no sympathy with the view that for man's sake all other things were created.20 There is no question of one being superior to another, or of any being miraculous. They are merely different, and in large measure the key to man's worth, as well as to the worth of other creatures, is to be found in variety itself. If no one creature, no one man, and no one human quality can be called perfect, yet each plays a part in a larger order. Having in the late 1570's swept away all the false grounds on which men based their ideas of high station, Montaigne was left with the broad assumption that mankind and individual men must have their definite function in this well-ordered universe. Thanks to his large optimism, the apparent negativism of the Apologie, instead of becoming any sort of nihilism with regard to man, led inevitably to a search for a definition 19 For his attack on anthropocentric religion and on the idea of an anthropomorphic God, see the sections of the Apologie at pp. 585, 596, et passim. 20 Villey thought that Montaigne was refuting Pliny particularly (Hist. NaL, vn, opening sentences) when he said in this same passage: "la licence de leurs opinions les esleve tantost au dessus des nues, et puis les ravale aux antipodes." The statement is general enough so that Montaigne could have had neither Pliny nor any other particular writer in mind. (Cf. Porteau's ed. of the Apologie, Paris, 1937,1. 794 n.) As for creatures "above" men, Mon? taigne's ridicule appears in n, xii, 596-598, A, B.</page><page sequence="11">Abraham C. Keiler 53 of his worth. Montaigne's final judgment of man's dignity came, then, on the one hand, from his refusal to discuss the dignity of man in the old terms of rank and hierarchy, and on the other hand from his acceptance of the most traditional kind of optimism. His unwillingness to discuss man in terms other than man's appeared at the end of the Apologie, where he spoke of the futility of a man's trying to rise above humanity, "car de faire la poignee plus grande que le poing, la brassee plusgrande que le bras, et d'esperer enjamber plus que de l'estandue de nos jambes cela est impossible et monstrueux" (n, xii, 682, A). But before 1580, man's limitations, as depicted in this statement, were presented with a tone of dejection, and with the pious remark that only God can raise man up. It remained for the essays of Book iii to turn man's natural limitations into a great source of strength, to find good in evil, strength in weakness, and unity in diversity. "Nostre vie est composee, comme l'armonie du monde, de choses contraires, aussi de divers tons, douz et aspres, aigus et plats, mols et graves. Le musicien qui n'en aymeroit que les uns, que voudroit il dire? II faut qu'il s'en scache servir en commun et les mesler. Et nous aussi les biens et les maux qui sont consubstantiels a nostre vie. Nostre estre ne peut sans ce meslange, et y est l'une bande non moins necessaire que l'autre" (iii, xiii, 1224, B). This positive con? clusion was a function of Montaigne's enduring optimism, which carried him through the crisis of denial to a new stage of arfirmation?and this, it seems to me, gives his optimism a more vital role in his thought than most readers have hitherto recognized. In the end, Montaigne's trust in Nature is complete. He tells us that we can make no mistake in following Nature (iii, xii, 1189, 1196, B), provided only?and this is his most serious message?that the individual succeeds in learning his inclinations and powers. "II n'est personne, s'il s'escoute, qui ne descouvre en soy une forme sienne, une forme maistresse, qui luicte contre l'institution, et contre la tempeste des passions qui luy sont contraires" (iii, ii, 907, B).21 Though it is difficult to pin down the various uses of the word "nature" in the essays,22 two significant meanings seem clearly distinguishable?nature in the large and each person's own nature. The trick is to bring about a harmony between the two, as the following quotation from Cicero indicates: "Sie est faciendum ut J1 See also iii, x, 1131, B. A counterpart in his social-political views is the idea that each nation has a form of government which specially suits its background. This may be de- termined on the basis of past experience: "Fexcellente et meilleure police est a chacune nation celle soubs laquelle elle s'est maintenug" (ni, ix, 1071, B). Reforms and improve- ments must be worked out within that framework.

(We must so act as not to conflict with the laws of universal nature; but, these being safeguarded, let us follow our own nature [iii, ix, 1108, C]). Montaigne's overriding ideal of the individual expressing himself and not allowing himself to be dominated from the outside appears in the following pregnant statement about his idol, Socrates. After saying that Socrates achieved his stature by his natural disposition rather than by leaps ("non par saillies mais par complexion"), Montaigne adds, or corrects, as follows: "Ou, pour mieux dire, il ne monta rien, mais ravala plustost et ramena a son point originel et na- turel, et lui soubmit la vigueur, les aspretez et les difficultez" (iii, xii, 1163, B). This, incidentally, and not intellectualizing or accumulating erudition, is the true function of reason. From this standpoint reason can be regarded as the medium through which Nature is able to show herself.23 Montaigne himself made almost extravagant claims, in Book iii, to being humble and without distinction, as if to prove that a man's worth is all inside, and independent of outward glory. Worldly success, the outcome of events, whether based on good fortune or on real ability, proves nothing of a man's worth; on the contrary, it diverts attention from his true substance and ought to be disregarded. (See iii, viii, 1046, B.) In the same vein, Montaigne deplored the study of man which most of us engage in at the expense of our own affairs "et Michel" (iii, ix, 1065, C) He insisted that moral philosophy can as well be applied to a common and private life as to one of richer stuff, for "chaque homme porte la forme entiere de l'humaine condition" (iii, ii, 900, B). And he loudly proclaimed, in a final addition to this statement, that his value as an author must rest, not on any special literary quality, but on the fact that he communicated to us his own universal being ("mon estre uni- versel") as Michel de Montaigne. From this standpoint Montaigne showed a greater regard for man than perhaps any other thinker in the Renaissance. Indeed, if, as it used to be said, humanism meant making man the measure of things, Montaigne was perhaps the most properly humanistic of the humanists, for he made man the measure, not so much of things in general, as of man himself.
