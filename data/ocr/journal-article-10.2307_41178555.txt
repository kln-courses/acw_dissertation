<plain_text><page sequence="1">A CONCEALED TOTALITY: Science and Poetry in The Essays of Stephen Jay Gould John E. Becker Ctephen Jay Gould's happy mix of literary exuberance and di- dactic science poses an obvious question: Is this poetry? Can it be? Can the writings of a scientist be poetic and stand up to the critical rationality of the scientific community? Or, do scientific habits of mind permit sufficient play of language and imagination to produce poetry? The definitive answer to such questions is the career of the poet-scientist himself. But asking the question is worthwhile if the attempt to answer it clarifies some interesting issues: the relationship of poetry to informa- tion, the assumed opposition between objectivity and emotion, the apparently profound conflict between science and the poet's impulse to remake the universe in the human image. Writers like Gould, Loren Eiseley, and Lewis Thomas have taken us so far beyond popularization that we are, I think forced to ask these questions. Moreover, if they really are writ- ing poetry perhaps we may hope that there will someday be a poetic corpus which will allow us all to take to heart the shifting visions of the universe that science keeps showing us, a poetry, that is, to rival the cosmic visions of the Bible, Dante, and Milton.

Becker Remote on heaven's hill, that has endured As April's green endures .... (Stevens, IV) The question is about poetry, not rhetoric. Gould's rhetoric is obvious enough, and it takes little literary sophistication to detect the pleasure he takes in it. His May 1987 column, for instance. Though the title is "Empire of the Apes," the open- ing scene is Venice, and the words are from Julian and Maddalo, a poem by Shelley that few encounter, I suspect, even in ad- vanced studies of Romantic literature. The question for the ha- bitual reader of Gould, however, is probably not, what's going on here? but rather, how will he do it this time? get from Shel- ley's Venice to the "Empire of the Apes"? He does it in two great leaps. Leap one, poetic generalization: Most wretched men Are cradled into poetry by wrong, They learn in suffering what they teach in song. Leap two is a maneuver Gould uses so often it could justifiably be called by his name - a kind of Gould shift: While I would not equate the wrong of heartache with the wrong of simple error, I can appreciate the salutary side of any honest intellectual fruit - for nothing illuminates a good argu- ment quite as well as the primary mistake that it corrects. ("Em- pire" 20) Gould lands on his feet, poised to attack an old and basic error: If we survived because we were fittest, how come apes sur- vived, too? Gould illustrates his answer with a simple and much-used metaphor: evolution is a bush, not a ladder. As the argument concludes, he deepens the tone and expands the the- matic scope dramatically: Man may be only a small twig on a bush that was once far more bushy than it is today; still humans have developed the most extraordinary new quality in all the history of multicellular life since the Cambrian explosion. We have in- vented consciousness with all its sequelae from Hamlet to Hiro- shima. (25) As if this were not enough for peroration, he rounds out his essay with another large leap, to the prophet Micah:</page><page sequence="3">Science and Poetry in the Essays of Stephen J. Gould 561 But thou, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel. (Micah 5:2) The text recalls the Messianic expectations of both testaments, but Gould, typically, uses it to teach humility rather than glory to come: rulers, he says, must "learn humility and respect from our common origins as fragile twigs on the bush of life." Gould takes an almost Euphuistic joy in the balance and an- tithesis of his sentences, and he makes no effort to conceal the components of his structure. The opening gambit comes out of left field; his transition calls attention to itself by a certain insouciant implausibility; the argument weaves in entertaining anecdotes as it shuttles back and forth between detail and the- ory. Gould's metaphors, the bush and the ladder, are illustra- tive and mnemonic rather than unique and personal. His literary citations are like Renaissance commonplaces, asserting "What oft was Thought, but ne'er so well Expresst" (Pope 1. 298). They are not always familiar, however, and he likes to give them his own interpretative twist. Still they implicitly af- firm the value of a textual tradition which, because it is both stable and interpretable, allows him to bestow some sense of cultural continuity on the shifting visions of the universe that science keeps flashing before our overtaxed imaginations. But if Gould strives for literary effect, he warns us off from calling him a poet. "I am a tradesman, not a polymath ..." (Darwin 14). His writing is "popular nature writing." He char- acterizes himself in Ontogeny and Phytogeny as "a very effective sponge (and a fair arranger of disparate information) . . . not much of a creator" (viii). He describes his work in quite utilita- rian terms as the "transmission of news about science to the public" (Panda 288), "the communication of science to a gen- eral audience" (Flamingo 16). His priorities are not those of im- aginative literature: "I never lie to you," he says first, and only after that: "I strive mightily not to bore you" (Flamingo 167). 1 In "Empire of the Apes," after recounting his discovery of snail fossils where no one else had been able to see them, Gould goes on to contrast his style with the genre in which he writes: The traditions of nature writing demand that this personal narra- tive now continue at some length, with overwritten paeans to the</page><page sequence="4">562 SOUNDINGS John E. Becker wonder of this discovery, set in glowing clichés about the stark and fragile . . . beauty of the countryside. But I desist. First of all, it isn't my style; it also doesn't match anything that actually happens in the field .... My favorite kind of excitement is quiet satisfaction. (24-25) Though Gould obviously glories in the flamboyance of his in- troductions, neither wonder, it would appear, nor over-writing will we find in the scientific body of his essays. No matter how exuberant his exordia, the rhetoric of discovery will remain subdued. Yet Gould does not programmatically reject wonder: "Won- der and knowledge are both to be cherished" (Darwin 27). In face of D'Arcy Thompson's ideas of Growth and Form, "I plead only ignorance and wonder" (Panda 41). He is expansive about the song of the whale: No scientific fact that I have learned in the last decade struck me with more force than Roger S. Payne's report that the length of some songs may extend for more than half an hour. I have never been able to memorize the five-minute first Kyrie of the B-minor Mass (and not for want of trying); how could a whale sing for thirty minutes and then repeat itself accurately? (Panda 302-03) But Gould can be too careful in the face of his emotional impulses. Marine life has been copious in its variety, ingenious in its adap- tation, and (if I may be permitted an anthropocentric comment) wondrous in its beauty. (Darwin 133) Does scientific accuracy really require such apologetic asides as this? Or this, in The Panda's Thumb, when - having explained that upright posture rather than the expansion of our brain is the real evolutionary surprise - he concludes his essay: Culture-bound creature than I am, the dream I will have in an hour or so when I'm supine astounds me ever so much more than the stroll I will now perform perpendicular to the floor. (132) It is a light-hearted apology, but an apology nevertheless. One passage, from The Flamingo 's Smile, is decisive, I think, in revealing the inhibitory effect on Gould's style of his scientific scrupulosity. On a visit to Africa, after speaking of the fascina- tion of being in the actual place where Australopithecus africanus roamed, Gould concedes that "our world does contain sacred</page><page sequence="5">Science and Poetry in the Essays of Stephen J. Gould 563 objects and places," and he follows up on this uncharacteristic affirmation with one of his most personal reflections: Last night, I watched the sun set over the South African sa- vanna - the original location and habitat of our australopithecine ancestors. The air became chill; sounds of the night began, the incessant repetition of toad and insect, laced with an occasional and startling mammalian growl; the Southern Cross appeared in the sky, with Jupiter, Mars, and Saturn ranged in a line above the arms of Scorpio. I sensed the awe, fear, and mystery of the night. / am tempted to say (describing emotions, not making any infer- ences about realities, higher or lower) that I felt close to the origin of reli- gion as a historical phenomenon of the human psyche. I also felt kinship in that moment with our most distant human past - for an Austra- lopithecus africanus may once have stood, nearly three million years ago, on the same spot in similar circumstances, juggling (for all I know) that same mixture of awe and fear. (185-86, ital- ics mine) Consider the italicized sentence. It is an obvious example of preteritio, the old rhetorical pose: I won't say what I'm saying. The parenthesis goes on to deny the value of any insight suf- fused with emotion. Finally, and in a most revealing way, Gould deals with that dangerous and anarchic word religion. He can't just say it. He has to pin it to earth with a most unpoetic, ball-and-chain qualifier, religion as a historical phenomenon of the human psyche. Shackled by this dragging intellectuality, Gould's awe, fear, and sense of mystery barely get through. Shelley may be right that "Most wretched men/Are cradled into poetry by wrong," but many others have been cradled into poetry by awe in the presence of a natural world so wondrous it evokes the sacred. But that poetry-engendering experience, as we see here, may be virtually smothered by rational defenses that are too strong.2 Those rational defenses, however, may seem inevitable. Any scientist navigating the sea of personal emotion by reason must be on guard against the Scylla and Charybdis of anthropomor- phism and anthropocentrism. But if this is true and good for scientists as scientists, what of scientists as poets? How can a poet, whose role is to make the world into a human home, avoid these two sources of scientific error? Do scientific imper- atives necessarily frustrate poetic ones and so confine Gould's writing within the narrow boundaries of exposition, embel- lished by a purely illustrative rhetoric.</page><page sequence="6">564 SOUNDINGS John E. Becker Anthropomorphism and Anthropocentrism Gould's caution before the deep, emotion-laden structures of his own cultural imagination is no mystery. The stories he tells are replete with the struggles of scientists whose minds were clouded and whose problems were intensified by pre-scientific cultural commitments deeply rooted in emotion. These are: (a) an anthropomorphic habit of interpreting nature and (b) an anthropocentric way of setting it into a universal system. Gould concedes that "the human order must veil all our in- teractions with the universe, . ." (Panda 120). Some form of anthropomorphism is inevitable and in some cases necessary: "My fraternity does not shun anthropomorphic language," he points out in a review of Adam's Task; "How else can we treat creatures with the same body parts, and some of the same emo- tional expressions as ourselves?" ("Animals" 21). Sometimes he lets himself be amused by our anthropomorphic drive: As I read through the nineteenth- and twentieth-century litera- ture on ichneumons, nothing amused me more than the tension between an intellectual knowledge that wasps should not be de- scribed in human terms and a literary or emotional inability to avoid the familiar categories of epic and narrative, pain and de- struction, victim and vanquisher. We seem to be caught in the mythic structures of our own cultural sagas, quite unable, even in our basic descriptions, to use any other language than the metaphors of battle and conquest. (Hen 's Teeth 35) He even allows himself to dwell - -with delicious anthropomor- phism - on the fate of the male anglerfish: "What male could resist the fantasy of life as a penis with a heart, deeply and per- manently embedded within a caring and providing female?" (Hen's Teeth 31). But Gould sees the dark side of anthropomorphism, and its potentially evil consequences, for instance, when scientists use words like rape to describe the hard-wired behavior of animals in order to suggest a genetic explanation of human outrages: [Sociobiologists] attach human names to what other creatures do and speak of slavery in ants, rape in mallard ducks, and adultery in mountain bluebirds. Since these 'traits' now exist among 'lower' animals, they can be derived from humans as natural, ge- netic, and adaptive. But they never did exist outside a human context. (Hen's Teeth 243-44)</page><page sequence="7">Science and Poetry in the Essays of Stephen J. Gould 565 If anthropomorphism distorts at the level of detail, anthro- pocentrism distorts the whole by creating a universe intrinsi- cally ordered toward man by a divine creator. Gould discusses two contemporary anthropocentric explanations of the world: the anthropic principle of Freeman Dyson, and Teilhard de Chardin's Phenomenon of Man. Gould dismisses as moth-eaten the anthropic argument: that the universe is intrinsically driven toward the evolution of mind because the slightest changes in its dimensions would make the evolution of mind impossible. (Flamingo 395) Any complex historical outcome . . . represents a summation of improbabilities and becomes thereby absurdly unlikely. Some- thing has to happen, even if any particular Something' must stun us by its improbability. He concedes that the principle is a "possible interpretation of the evidence" (401), but "I, for one, will seek my hope else- where. I would also be surprised, but not in the slightest dis- pleased, if, mirabile dictu, Wallace and Dyson were right after all" (401). The more important point for Gould is that the principle does not prove.3 He is surprisingly sympathetic in his discussion of Teilhard de Chardin, the Jesuit anthropologist-theologian who saw in evolution a movement into the spiritual, from the biosphere into the noosphere (Flamingo 245). He respects Chardin's work as a paleo-anthropologist and concedes that the question whether the universe centers on man, as Chardin puts it, is ulti- mately a metaphysical question, beyond science. Still, Gould says, these large anthropocentric systems don't work. The fos- sil record shows no "trend toward increasing braininess in the history of life" (Hen's Teeth 250). Yet again, he veers away from complete rejection: We live in an essential and unresolvable tension between our unity with nature and our dangerous uniqueness. Systems that attempt to place and make sense of us by focusing exclusively either on the uniqueness or the unity are doomed to failure. But we must not stop asking and questing because the answers are complex and ambiguous. We can do no better than follow Lin- naeus's advice, embodied in his description of Homo sapiens within his system. He described other species by the numbers of their fingers and toes, their size and color. For us, in place of anatomy, he simply wrote the Socratic injunction: Know thyself. (250)</page><page sequence="8">566 SOUNDINGS John E. Becker Gould, though he personally rejects theism, acknowledges that science cannot exclude it.4 Theism, however, is less worrisome to him than teleology. Roughly three millennia ago the emergent idea of a teleologi- cal universe was an intellectual leap forward. It displaced the mythic universe where no natural laws kept squabbling gods and goddesses from turning people into beasts and trees. Tel- eology implied a more orderly universe where the various crea- tures had their own proper reality "according to their kind." But science had to win out over that teleological vision to do its work, and today teleology is scorned as hubris. Gould prefers that we acknowledge we don't know why everything is the way it is. We are better off, he thinks, confronting the open pos- sibilities of a shifting world of improvised creatures. In other words, human beings fit the way all other creatures fit: enough to survive, but otherwise, not quite. Actually noth- ing quite fits. When creatures fit, it's only "sort of and for a time. Consequently, when we find pattern, we must not think of it as "designed for us or towards us" {Flamingo 15). In other words, "Nature contains no moral messages framed in human terms ..." (Hen's Teeth 42). Darwinism compels us to seek meaning elsewhere - and isn't that what art, music, literature, ethical theory, personal struggle, and Koestlerian humanism are all about? Why make demands of nature and try to restrict her ways when the answers (even if they are personal and not absolute) lie within ourselves? {Panda 83) Our desire to find a meaning already out there inscribed on nature is merely a gut reaction (Hen's Teeth 342) - emotions, in other words - reflecting that cultural bias against which every scientist, and presumably every scientifically informed layman, must be always on guard. "Always be suspicious of conclusions that reinforce uncritical hope and follow comforting traditions of Western thought," Gould warns (Flamingo 401). And so, whether because he doesn't consider himself suffi- ciently creative to be a poet or because he is suspicious of the biases that emerge under the license of poetry, Gould does not give himself much room for poetic expression. The poiesis he most often describes is the scientific reflection that takes place in the field, the laboratory, wherever the scientist pursues knowledge. How can it be poetry, then, that Gould writes -</page><page sequence="9">Science and Poetry in the Essays of Stephen J. Gould 567 that act of creative immersion in language from which new in- sights emerge, whatever the shape and solidity of the insights one brings to it? Shouldn't we rather be content, as Gould seems to be, to call Gould's style a highly effective explanatory rhetoric? Perhaps, but not before we ask whether poetry might not have a wider definition than we habitually give it, and more cru- cial functions. A Rhetorical Poetry of Information Recent critics have insisted that all literature, insofar as it takes account of its audience, is rhetorical, that is, it promotes an ideology. Walter Ong points out that Western culture, at least until the romantic age, was always a "rhetorical culture" {Interfaces 214, Rhetoric 1), that is, a culture which subsumed po- etry under rhetoric. But Ong is less concerned that language may be used to distort or control perception or to persuade and move an audience to action. He is more interested in the remembering and informing function of rhetoric, a function that was perhaps more important in earlier periods when knowledge was scarce. During the oral and manuscript stage of Western culture, in- formation was "in desperately short supply," and artists were valuable for what they could remember. They remembered by reciting (Rhetoric 277), their own and their audiences' memories aided by the sometimes flamboyant, but usually well-worn de- vices of rhetoric. The anxiety of an oral culture to keep alive the fund of inherited knowledge did not instantly disappear with the spread of writing. It was almost as hard to look things up in a manuscript, as it was, before writing, to go find a poet to sing you the epic that contained the knowledge you needed. Before print, the art of remembering remained one of the most admired and crucial skills of learned men,5 and the rhetorical art of making information memorable remained an essential function of poets. In a noetic economy of scarcity the worst that could happen was that the world should forget the deposit of inherited knowledge. Poetry and rhetoric both shared the overriding aim of preserving knowledge by embedding it in powerful emotions.</page><page sequence="10">568 SOUNDINGS John E. Becker This is an aspect of earlier literature we tend to pass over, and one we need to retrieve if we are to understand the poetic appropriateness of scientific information. Poetry in the pre- print economy of knowledge was highly rhetorical because, whatever the pleasure derived from it, poetry was a fundamen- tal repository of information, and its informative function was crucial. A rhetorical style was necessary not only when persua- sion, legitimation, or action was the aim, but also and always, to assure that the inherited fund of knowledge was made so mem- orable as to be remembered. If today we read Dante's comedy because it evokes in beauti- ful language a curious and highly personal inner journey, Dante and his readers were more concerned to remember and communicate what everyone needed to know about the, to them, "hard facts" of the theologically shaped universe they lived in. In such a world there was little if any tension between accurate knowledge and poetic insight. When "print locked information into exactly the same place upon the page in thousands of copies of the same book," "knowledge came suddenly to the fingertips" and "man ac- quired an intellectual security never known before" (Ong Rhet- oric 277-78). At that point the knower's role could change from rememberer of the known, to explorer of the unknown. The scientist was free to explore the unknown outer universe while the poet turned toward the equally unexplored realm of the inner self. Keats didn't want to remember or to be told the traditional story pictured on the Grecian urn. That would have bound him to cultural interpretations of the art. Not knowing the story, he was free to use the urn to explore and reflect on his own inner crises. The easy abundance of stored knowledge and the conse- quent disappearance of anxiety over cultural memory opened a chasm between rhetoric and poetry. In this new age of knowl- edge as exploration, rhetoric became a bad word . . . for those given to technology because it represented "soft" thinking . . . for those given to romanticism because it seemed to hint that the controlling element in life was a contrivance rather than freedom . . . (Ong, Rhetoric 8) There are many reasons, no doubt, for the interest of con- temporary critics in denying the distinction between rhetoric</page><page sequence="11">Science and Poetry in the Essays of Stephen J. Gould 569 and poetry. But, critics or not, we all share a new and pecu- liarly modern problem with information, especially with scien- tific information, but also with poetry. Though most of us are literate and able to look things up, few of us are poets and few are scientists. The fruits of these two divergent explorations have become harder and harder to digest. Most of us simply shrug off modern poetry, impatient with the puzzling intrica- cies of the poet's private vision. We are equally, perhaps more, helpless before the complexities of scientific discourse. We are, in fact, in something of the same noetic situation as the anxious medievals. Difficulties inherent in the very nature of scientific knowledge have reproduced, for all the abundance of our noetic economy, an information anxiety analogous to that of ancient society. Their problem of remembering what all could understand has been replaced by our problem of under- standing what all can easily look up. However, the other side of noetic anxiety, both today and in the past, is the profound pleasure one may get out of having it allayed. It is wonderful when someone tells us in a memorable way the truth about the world we live in. It has long been recognized that literature teaches as well as de- lights, but in the West in the past 100 years or so, the delight has been the center of interest and the teaching ignored or brushed aside. In most cultures, however, the didactic function of litera- ture has not been ignored or brushed aside. Even in our West- ern popular culture, teaching is by no means ignored as comics, soap operas, romances and popular songs all reveal. The "art for art's sake" movement of the late nineteenth century still flourishes in high-brow art. Art must not be useful. This is not the assumption under which most of the world operates (Bloom- field 21). Just as rhetoric is not necessarily unpoetic for being persuasive, so such rhetorical communication as Gould excels in may be poetic precisely by being informative. It is easy to sympathize with Ronald Weber's suggestion in The Literature of Fact that some of our pleasure in the literature of information may be the product of our disillusionment with a fiction that refuses to convey any other news of the world than that the world no longer makes sense (10). Gould and his fellow science-writers are not merely commu- nicating the information that has undermined the old ways of</page><page sequence="12">570 SOUNDINGS John E. Becker making sense, but they are trying to convey to us the human sense that science makes. Effectively they are doing what stu- dents of orality and literacy have been telling us Homer did, and what the Bible did. They are passing on the cultural heri- tage, giving the world the shape our seers have seen. Is Poetic Information True? On the other side of the question of the purity of art is the question of the reliability of knowledge shaped by feeling. Re- currently and habitually Gould dismisses the gut reactions which lead us to try to find intrinsic meaning in nature {Hen's Teeth 342); still, he has to admit that gut reactions are valuable, perhaps even necessary: An abstract, intellectual understanding of deep time comes eas- ily enough - I know how many zeros to place after the 10 when I mean billions. Getting it into the gut is quite another matter. Deep time is so alien that we can really only comprehend it as metaphor. (Time's Arrow 3; see also Panda 323) Unfortunately, or fortunately, knowledge in the gut is knowl- edge shaped by desire. Its facts are often not well defined; they may be linked by imagination rather than logic. Yet the knowl- edge in the gut is the knowledge we remember. It is the knowl- edge we find in living myth, and it is out of living myth that poetry arises. Northrop Frye, in defining not just poetry but all work, says that it "moves in the direction of transforming na- ture into a world with a human shape, meaning, and function" {Great Code 72). Poetry, Frye says, "belongs to the world man constructs, not to the world he sees; to his home, not his envi- ronment" (Imagination 28). Poetry makes us a home, and this is precisely what science is not about. Haven't we seen that Gould's didactic rhetoric, pleasurable though it is, habitually excludes too much of human desire to root itself in mythic un- derstanding and become poetic? The apparent antithesis between the impersonal truths scien- tists ask us to see and the mythic understandings we construct in furnishing the universe as our home, suggests a parallel dis- tinction Edward Harrison makes in Masks of the Universe, "No person," he argues, can live as a human being, particularly as a member of a society, unless equipped with grand ideas concerning the world around.</page><page sequence="13">Science and Poetry in the Essays of Stephen J. Gould 571 These grand ideas . . . establish the universe in which that person lives, (vii) These ideas "rationalize human experience . . . harmonize and invest [it] with meaning ..." (1). "But individuals do not live entirely in the universe of their society," and so Harrison introduces the notion of "world pic- tures, the multifarious worlds in which individuals live" (6). A world picture looks "outward to a societal universe of common knowledge and inward to a personal world of emotive imagery" (8). Personal world pictures are the repositories of mythic ele- ments from earlier, societal universes. They invest the societal universe with personal meaning and value judgment, color it with emotion and sensuality, clothe it with beauty and ugliness; they sustain us with fanciful hopes for the future and reassuring memories of the past. (9) "The excitement of living comes from the conflict of world pic- tures and a universe" (10). It is easy to recognize Harrison's "personal world of emotive imagery" as the familiar realm of poetry, but, on second glance, we must recognize as equally poetic the ancient poetic tradition of "grand ideas" which "rationalize human experience . . . har- monize and invest [it] with meaning." Home-making, myth- making, the expression of human desire, work on many levels. The poet of the interior expresses in all its personal urgency the struggle between the invading facts and the traditional tele- ological and anthropocentric myths. But the science writer, too, is inspired by desire - in his case, the desire that, since we must make a home of the universe, it ought to be solid and true. Both are poets; both are engaged in public work: "Un- derneath literature," Frye says, there's [a] kind of subconscious, which is social, and not private, a need for forming a community around certain symbols, .... This is the myth-making power of the human mind, which throws up and dissolves one civilization after another. {Imagina- tion 103) The Work of the Scientist Poet To return, then, to Gould, is he a poet in spite of himself? Or is he a scientist-rhetorician merely giving science a better- than-average write-up? He is clearly a scientist; he wants to</page><page sequence="14">572 SOUNDINGS John E. Becker give us more than an easy tour of the zoo of nature's fascinat- ing beasts, more than an anecdotal list of mind-boggling "dis- coveries." He gives us history of science, theories, data, methods, and controversies. But we as laymen, with only frag- ments of the matrix by which data and theories can be organ- ized and remembered, too quickly forget both the fascinating details and the intricate theories. Unable to participate in the scientific enterprise, we are perhaps too ready to enjoy the zoo and share Gould's pleasure in the endless ingenuity of the theorists. The question shifts, then, from Gould to his readers. Rather than call ourselves dilettantes dabbling in popular science, it seems better to say that we look for and find in Gould an in- formative poetry of grand ideas that contributes to our own in- dividual efforts to make this world a human habitation. Allow me to evoke my undergraduate enthusiasm for historical fic- tion, particularly for the novels of Sigrid Undset. Though my literature teachers warned me that I should not read historical novels for history, I knew, as I devoured her books, skipping classes and assignments, that she was, in fact, giving me real news of the past, and that a real anxiety for knowledge was be- ing allayed. I don't mean to suggest that Gould's essays are suspect sci- ence, as fiction may be suspect history. I mean, in fact, the op- posite. I mean that my teachers, though prudent, were wrong. My youthful immersion in historical fiction was, I am con- vinced, a genuine, if poetic, experience of historical fact. Con- versely, Gould's scientific essays may be no less poetic for being informative. Literature is, before anything else, informa- tive; it really is, as Cynthia Ozick insists, "about something" (51), and the effort to isolate poetic experience from the refer- ential flow of information and argument within a culture is fu- tile. It narrows literature, robs it of its dignity, its weight, its central position in culture (Havelock 119-20). In the novels of Sigrid Undset I caught a glimpse of the kind of blood and guts faith it took to support the elaborate struc- ture of medieval thought I happened to study in my class in medieval philosophy. To adapt a phrase from George Lukacs' Theory of the Novel, Undset revealed the "concealed totality"</page><page sequence="15">Science and Poetry in the Essays of Stephen J. Gould 573 (60) of a world I was studying only in part in my philosophy and theology courses. Though Gould does not pretend to the sense of totality that Lukacs asks of the novel, he communicates far more than sci- ence. He evokes something of science's concealed totality, the profound personal and broad cultural dimensions of this world-making enterprise. The science that grounds our cul- tural universe has not been able to bring all out into the light. If anything, it has deepened our sense of a universe shaped by hidden forces. Gould's detailed and intricate descriptions of the invisible or unnoticed biota of our world confront our imaginations with fantastic images of sex and violence. We cannot help but read them as images of human life, though Gould repeatedly warns us that they are unreliable images. Both images and warnings elicit in us that necessary struggle between personal world picture and cultural universe by which we endeavor to define our place. At some level, we are forced to respond to his writing as to poetry. The historical novels of the nineteenth century, again ac- cording to Lukacs, reflected an important integration of the popular mind into the world. War, a sense of Europe as a con- tinental culture, the idea of being part of a nation, were all, until the French Revolution, phenomena that had been part of the personal experience only of an elite. But the experiences of the revolution and of the Napoleonic era allowed masses of people for the first time to see themselves as part of a nation {Historical Novel 25) and their nation as a historical place. What previously was experienced only by isolated and mostly ad- venturous-minded individuals, namely an acquaintance with Eu- rope or at least certain parts of it, becomes in this period the mass experience of hundreds of thousands, of millions. {Histori- cal Novel 24) The scientist-seekers whose stories Gould tells struggled with an emergent knowledge that threatened the foundations of all sense. The regular recurrence of these biographical sto- ries in Gould, always different, yet always with elements of the same theme, creates a kind of epic scope and rhythm which de- mands that we reflect on the enduring human struggle between disruptive knowledge and traditional culture.</page><page sequence="16">574 SOUNDINGS John E. Becker So, as masses of people struggled in the nineteenth century to assimilate history, we struggle to assimilate science. And sci- ence, as Gould concedes, is carrying out a series of "assaults upon pervasive biases of Western thought" (Flamingo 15), as- saults which add up to a slow but relentless apocalypse of the collective mind. We see it most obviously in that broad and noisy arena where fundamentalist preachers rant and court cases on teaching evolution are decided and appealed, but we experience it ourselves on the deepest personal levels. The crisis, we realize, will continue. Scientists are never con- tent with any given universe; their business is to create new ones. But it's a difficult thing to base meaning and life on grand ideas which in spite of being grand are only true insofar as they are falsifiable. It's a difficult thing never to be able to come home, always to be pitching a new tent on the shore of a newly discovered world. Cultures were invented to overcome precisely just such a sense of constant dis- or, if you will, re- orientation. In face of the threat this continuing historical crisis engen- ders, Gould may not be willing to explore publicly his own per- sonal struggles, as we expect poets to do, but neither does he hide. Though his reactions are the public reactions proper to an historian or scientist, he gives himself a genuine poetic per- sona. It is hard, for instance, to ignore the Oedipal delight he takes in the process that begets our cultural crisis. "At its most exciting," he declares, "[science] reformulates our view of the world by imposing powerful theories against the ancient an- thropocentric prejudices that we call intuition" (Darwin 91). "Scientists," he tells us later don't immerse themselves in particulars only for the grandiose (or self-serving) reason that such studies may lead to important generalities. We do it for fun. The pure joy of discovery tran- scends import. And we do it for adventure and for expansion. (Flamingo 168) Obviously, Gould enjoys it all, both ends, the joy of detailed investigation and of large theoretical conflict; and his own cheerful encounters with scientific truth allow us a glimmer of hope. But the nineteenth-century historical novel is not, after all, the most satisfactory poetic analogue for Gould's public poetry.</page><page sequence="17">Science and Poetry in the Essays of Stephen J. Gould 575 His subject is broader than the social upheavals that concern most novelists; it is the nature of life itself, and that brings us back to the question, problematic but inevitable and necessary, of the poetic expression of wonder and awe. Gould, simply by putting the data of modern science into popular form, partici- pates, willy-nilly, in the continuous and poetic process of re- writing Genesis. To adapt one of Whitman's expostulations about America, modern science is "something in the doings of man that corresponds to the broadcast doings of day and night" (5). The trouble with Genesis, as with most creation stories, is that they tend to assert a harmony between man and nature which science denies. Our relationship with science must be paradoxical because we are forced to pay an almost intolerable price for each major gain in knowledge and power - the psychological cost of progressive dethronement from the center of things, and increasing margin- ali ty in an uncaring universe. (Wonderful Life 44) However, there are more books in the Bible than Genesis, though in the context of arguments about evolution one hears of them less. There is, for instance, the Book of Job, an even better poetic and a better Biblical analogue than Genesis. Job When God steps in to end the interminable wrangle between Job and his comforters, He vindicates Job. But before He does, He subjects Job to a stinging rebuke, "Who is this whose igno- rant words cloud my design in darkness?" (38:2). Then in thunderous poetry, God makes Job look at the splendor of his creation. God's poem evokes no Eden, no locus amoenus, no picturesque landscape of the mind. It is punctuated by visions of monsters: the ostrich, whose wings are stunted, and who abandons her eggs, "not caring if her labour is wasted" (39:13-16); the behe- moth, a "hippopotamus" and/or "crocodile," "the chief of God's works," "who devours cattle as if they were grass" (40:15). The point of these passages, according to Rudolf Otto in The Idea of the Holy, is that, though all the other animals express God's power, monsters</page><page sequence="18">576 SOUNDINGS John E. Becker express in masterly fashion the downright stupendousness, the well nigh daemonic and wholly incomprehensible character of the eternal creative power; how, incalculable and * wholly other', it mocks at all conceiving but can yet stir the mind to its depths, fascinate and overbrim the heart. (80) In fact, what God is imagining here is a different kind of nature from the nature of the Genesis creation account. Nature in the Book of Job is an inharmonious nature. And this vision grounds a theodicy that is the very opposite of the easy, quid- pro-quo theodicy of Job's comforters. The God of Job, in fact, calls into question the doctrine of creation that underlies the Pentateuch. That theodicy was ideological, and anthropocen- tric: obey God and prosper. But Job obeys God and loses everything. Job's soul is finally brought to peace through his confrontation with the terrifying and alien nature God de- scribes (Holy 80). Peace for Job arises not out of any harmoni- ous, teleological, anthropocentric wrap-up of the relationship between God and man, but in poetic confrontation with the ut- ter mystery and power of creation. The poetry of God, it would appear, is quite compatible with Gould's message. The message of both the Book of Job and of Gould's essays is that the universe is stingy of eternal verities, that it is incongruous, open, and ultimately unknown. The God of the whirlwind denies that He has made a neatly teleological and anthropocentric universe. He insists on the demonic and incomprehensible quality of His creation. And He does it in poetry. Given so poetic an expression of chaos by God, the scientist in Gould need be no less poetic for his allegiance to the decentering of man. The rhetorical impulse behind Gould's writing arises from the mission he has chosen to correct the anthropomorphism and anthropocentrism of popular poetics. It does not arise from the nature of poetry itself. At the same time Gould, by the vividness and detail of his writings and the excitement of his involvement in the scientific adventure, contributes to that culture-wide poem being written by the best of our "science writers." If we take Northrop Frye's definition as our reference point, that the work of poets is "transforming nature into a world with a human shape, meaning, and function" (Great Code 72), Gould forces us to go on and say that this poetic transformation ought</page><page sequence="19">Science and Poetry in the Essays of Stephen J. Gould 577 not be a distortion of the facts that science reveals, but rather a free and deliberate act. It is seeing things the way they are that makes the world man's "home, not his environment" {Imagina- tion 28). As Gould himself puts it: We may . . . learn to seek the meaning of human life, including the source of morality, in other, more appropriate domains - either stoically with a sense of loss, or with joy in the challenge if our temperament be optimistic. (Wonderful Life 44) The point is that we are the ones who are doing it, making a home of a world in which we are only more or less fit to survive, and only for a time. It takes some optimism to be a scientist, or a poet, or just a human being. NOTES 1. One of Gould's more complete statements of what he is doing appears in the "Preface and Acknowledgements" of Wonderful Life (16-17) where he defines his audience as an audience of both specialists and interested general readers. But he asks for more than rational understanding: "You could skip the anatomy and still get the general message . . . but please don't for you will then never understand either the fierce beauty or the intense excitement of the Burgess drama" (16). And a bit later: "Please bear with the details; they are accessible, and they are the gate- way to a new world" (17). These visions are what poets strive to communicate. 2. In Wonderful Life Gould is either more bold or more playful: The animals of the Burgess Shale are holy objects - in the un- conventional sense that this word conveys in some cultures. We do not place them on pedestals and worship from afar. We climb mountains and dynamite hillsides to find them. We quarry them, split them, carve them, draw them, and dissect them, struggling to wrest their secrets. We vilify and curse them for their damnable intransigence. They are grubby little creatures of a sea floor 530 million years old, but we greet them with awe because they are the Old Ones, and they are trying to tell us something. (52) 3. However, see Robert Wright, The New Republic. 4. Gould likes to play with the idea of an ordering intelligence, for instance, in Wonderful Life, where he invents "the Great Token-Stringer," who ini- tially plays with lots of body plans before making a "much more orderly set of new creatures" (218): The youthful firebrand has become the apostle of good sense and stable design. Yet the former spark is not entirely extinct. Some- thing truly new slips by now and then within the boundaries of strict inheritance. Perhaps his natural vanity finally got the better of him.</page><page sequence="20">578 SOUNDINGS John E. Becker Perhaps he couldn't bear the thought of running such an exquisite play for so long, and having no chronicler to admire the work. So he let the token for more brain tumble from compartment 1 of the pri- mate bag - and assembled a species that could paint the caves of Lascaux, frame the glass of Chartres, and finally decipher the story of the Burgess shale. As the scholastics used to say, bonum est diffusivum sui; or, more recently, Karl Rahner, man is "the event of God's . . . self-communication" (116). 5.
