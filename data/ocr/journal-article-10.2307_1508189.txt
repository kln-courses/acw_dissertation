INTRODUCTION THE text is written on a single sheet of papyrus cut from a roll; a join runs down the centre, and others are visible on either side. Top and sides of the sheet are more or less intact, but it is broken off at the foot and there is nothing to indicate its original height. We may perhaps assume that it would not be much over 30 cm., in which case anything up to fifteen lines of writing are now lost. The writing, which is along the fibres on the recto, is a rather large and loose cursive. The formation of the letters is haphazard, initial letters being not merely en- larged but often eccentrically so (e.g. the 6 at the beginning of lines 12 and 18 and the X of line 16). In addition the scribe was apt to let his pen run dry, making it necessary for him to re-write the last few letters when he had taken a fresh supply, so that in these passages the papyrus has somewhat the appear- ance of a palimpsest. The papyrus may be assigned with practical certainty to the end of the Ptolemaic period; not only is the general style of the hand close to that of the documents published in BGU, VIII, but there are one or two of them - noticeably 1768, 1826, 1764, 1846 - which present a striking resemblance to the graphic peculiarities of our text.' 1 Dr. Schubart very kindly pointed out this resemblance; he regards the at- tribution of the text, on palaeographical grounds, to the late Ptolemaic period as</page><page sequence="2">40 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Abbreviations have been extended; in the papyrus the last letter before the abbreviation is usually placed above the line, except where otherwise indicated in the notes.

COMMENTARY On grounds of writing the text is ascribed to the end of the Ptolemaic age: the wording of line 10 (note ad loc.) confirms this and suggests a time in the reign of Ptolemy Auletes, per- haps one between 69 and 58 B.c. The chief representatives of this period among the papyri are the documents published by W. Schubart and D. Schaifer from the archives of Heracleopolis.2 They are marked by a certain clumsiness of style, notably an inclination to use participles for finite verbs, an awkwardness of construction,3 and a liking for neologisms. This is the law of an association and as such is unique among the Greek records so far published from Egypt.4 It is a copy or draft and not the original; so much is shown by 1. 7, 'the aforementioned month and day,' which refers to a dating which has not here been given, and which is in fact regularly prefixed in the Demotic parallels quoted later.5 Individual 2 BGU, VIII. 3 The abrupt shifts of mood and tense in our text (infinitive, future, imperative) are paralleled in earlier Greek laws relating to priesthoods, e.g. SIG, 1003, 1009- 1012, 1016 (Iasos, 4th cent. B.c.; at the beginning of this there is an analogy for the 6~ of 1. 10; Kad 7r-6E lepao6w 6 lepebi ro70 Ats ro7 Me-yoirov. Xal4avrwo 3 ( . . ). I The fragment from Magdola (82 later) includes regulations, as does SB, 4549; OGI, 130 refers to a new foundation, but is a dedication. Professor A. E. R. Boak has kindly communicated a provisional text of P. Mich. 2710 - the nomos of a gild of the freedmen of Claudius resident at Tebtunis providing for the elec- tion of a 7'yobjevos for a year (the fourth of Claudius). It shows striking similari- ties to our text. 6 Cf. pp. 80 f. later.</page><page sequence="5">THE GILD OF ZEUS HYPSISTOS 43 members needed copies, and a copy was liable to be abbrevi- ated; this may account in part for the harshness of the phras- ing.6 But the date would matter to a member, and this may therefore be a draft kept by an official of the club and used by him for the making of notes. The law of such a society, in Egypt as in Greece, was in the nature of a contract by which members bound themselves,' and under Philopator a woman made a petition to obtain redress for the failure of a thiasos to render what was due to her dead brother: the strategos directed the local official to examine the law of the thiasos and compel the performance of what was due.8 The state had a certain interest in the conduct of such societies, since gilds commonly imposed on offending members fines payable to the king as well as fines payable to themselves. Furthermore, an edict of Euergetes II in the year 124 B.C. makes provision in regard to the property of institutions,' but there is no evidence for state interference in their concerns till we come to Roman times,10 and no indication of any registra- tion of these private statutes; had it existed, the petitioner just mentioned would hardly have failed to refer to it. Gild agreements were not treated like ordinary contracts which related to buying and selling, nor was the terminology of such contracts applied to them. We can only conjecture that an 6 Cf. P. Mich.

W. F. Edgerton, Miinch. Beitr. z. Pap. u. ant. Rechtsgesch., 19, 1934, 299 ff., remarks that some older Egyptian legal documents are not full texts but abstracts or even ex parte statements. 7 Cf.

Cichorius, Ramische Studien, 21), ordering those who initiated for Dionysus to come to Alexandria and deposit their sacred books under seal, is a measure regulating not associations but self-ordaining min- isters of the type discussed by Nock, Conversion, 28ff., 277. At Talmis in the fifth century of our era the king names officials of the synodoi for Isis (Otto, Priester u. Tempel, 1. 251 n. 2), but this is outside Egypt. 1x For this cf. Mitteis, Grundz., 47ff. and SB, 6704, in which huntsmen of</page><page sequence="6">44 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW official copy was kept in the archives of the society - in its own buildings when it had them, in a public temple when, as here, that was used (and then possibly as an inscription). 1-2.

We might put a strong stop after bLtayopEb~L and translate 'and, what is more, acting as it orders,' for both ,at and the participle are used in a very free way.13 But it seems preferable to put a strong stop after ovb68ov and no more than a comma after 8tayopEbea; then 7rp&amp;l-rop y is used as though 8Eh7Epo' 6 or E17a 6E were to follow. The association is formed for a single year (pp. 79 ff. later); the underlying agreement is 'We shall meet for a year to do certain things under a president x, who is to be designated in due course.' The initiative comes from the association; Petesuchos is not a founder.13a So in P. Dem. Cairo 31178.7, 30605.24, regulations are made for a similar association to last a year and there is a fine for a man who refuses when asked to be president. 7rpoxaptarErotl is a regular verb for a designation of an individual to perform particular functions, whether he is designated by govern- Aphrodito in 538 A.D. made a contract with their accepted leaders. The laws of associations are not 'agrapha,' for agreements so described imply the existence of 'engrapha,' instruments achieving the same purpose with full formality. The normal basis of associations lies in something like the Solonian law quoted by Gaius in the Digest 47.22.4, a 6E 6-ouos 7 phropEs ~ lepciv Opyl~ i wv aTa~ i7 OOLaTOL i7 OA bTaoot "i Otaw&amp;rTat i' rlXEL'av ol'XEvot E"ta El OP'i, o-L a 7rov 8wtaOwnrav wpb6 aXX'XovS, KVrpLO Eat, &amp;i' dLv A raayopEdo7f prl87o5La ypAlAgaTa. 12 Cf.

We assume therefore that in 1. 8 roLte?- stands for 7roLEt-OaL, assuming a vowel error, which while not common in Ptolemaic papyri, is found in them (E. Mayser, Grammatik, 1, 107). This leaves bA (if correctly read) in the air: it is sometimes inserted in an apodosis without logi- cal grounds (A. Wilhelm, Symb. Oslo, 13, 1934, 6 f.) and is used after a participial clause - without there being a genuine antithesis of correlated words or clauses (Mayser, Grammatik, 2, iii, 126, 132 f.). Here the sense requires direct dependence on the participle, for which we lack a parallel: but 5C is used so freely that it may be right. 6. 7yoi4VeoYV.

Je means 'saith' and ho 'face,' and the mean- ing in such collocations must be 'the face (of the child) betrays the (Horus) hawk, (Thoth) ibis' etc. according to circumstances.

Its earlier usage suggests 'learned,' its usage in the first century A.D. also 'eloquent,' 'intelligent'; it is vague, like 'a gentleman and a scholar,' 'a literary man.' Cf.

Pap. 9, 19~8, 87 is probably right in explaining K.T. as Misenum; the physical aspect of the place is stressed as in Aeschin. Epist. 1.5. which he quotes. An- other parallel is Mitteis, Chrest. 31, I 10 robs arr, 7r00 r6ov xoaxbra (116 B.C.), referring to Diospolis. In favor of (2) we might refer to the common use of r-ros to denote the place of meeting or landed property belonging to an association (San Nicolb, Vereinswesen, 1, 17, 92; 2, 141 f. and SB, 7290; out- side Egypt, Keil-von Premerstein, Dritte Reisebericht (Denkschr. Wien, 57, 1, 1914) no. 95), or to a politeuma (Lefebvre, Ann. Serv. Ant. 13, 1913, 88ff.). Professor R. Marcus has drawn attention to its common use in the Apocrypha to denote the temple at Jerusalem (without epithet), as also in 2 Macc. 1. 14 of the temple of Nanaia: it is used also of a synagogue (Philo, Quod omnis probus liber sit, 81, ii, p. 458 M; perhaps in an inscription at Gaza, Clermont-Ganneau, Rec. arch. orient., 4, 140). But our association did not own a shrine, and, in any case, since neither the community nor the place of meet- ing has yet been mentioned, the first would be understood rather more easily than the second. (1) is therefore more probable, and our faith in it is strengthened by a decree of the Athenians resident in Delos in 147/6 B.C., praising a gymnasiarch who Ka-r' r-6 [7rs aPX?7s] xpbWoV v0YWErph? 4 7LX O3WS Kal a~eL?wS ro 7E 7- rov Kal r[^ S roo] u7v] ov rpoaLtpEOws (F.

Such a religious society had local feeling and a measure of local standing. In any case, the neighborhood had a considerable strength of communal feeling in antiquity, as in Germany down to modern times (L.

H. M.

Both Dura texts were deposited in the same niche, and the text accompanyng the bas-relief ascribes the dedication to Adadiabos, who is one of the members of the &amp;ratpela. Is it possible that Adadiabos met the expenses of the dedicatory ceremonies (for which cf. Cumont, Fouilles, 409) ? It may be suggested that the a6vYpWw is not the lepbv but one of the buildings in the precinct.

For the attribution to private organisations of places in temples cf. p. 78 later. We have assumed that &amp; als means n als rb6oatvE 'on the occasion of which drinkings,' and that a stands after plac as a synonymous sign. Professor Wilcken has raised a serious objection that the stroke over the a ought to make it an ordinal; further, there is a gap before it as large as that before b7raKovbaea, and this should mean a transition. He therefore proposes to treat a as meaning 7rpcraIs, and to read Vats, assuming i~yr to mean EyPl Kal Va, the last day of the month. The association would be meeting on the first day of the month in the temple of Zeus and on the last day of the month in their andron, perhaps alternately 85 for it is expressly stated that there is to be one drinking a month. It is hard to dissent from Professor Wilcken, and the stylistic peculiarities of the text make a decision peculiarly difficult, but: (1) there seems to be no clear parallel for (r_7 in the sense of ygr Kia 4a.15 In Hesiod Works and Days 770 it means 'the first of the month'; 16 in Attic we have Es E iry meaning 'till the day after to- morrow,' but, it seems, no other use of ,'yq alone; 17 (1) even in our abbreviated text the habit of alternating meeting places ought surely to be stated clearly, as in SB, 7457 (later p. 51) and P. Dem. Cairo 30619; (3) the use of letters of the alphabet with a transverse bar above them as cardinal numerals is extremely common in the third cent. B.C. and though later unusual is far from unexampled; e.g., P. Oxy. 255 (48 A.D.); (4) the space on either side of the numeral is usual; (5) the construction becomes even harsher.

Collomp, Recherches sur la chancellerie et la diplomatique des Lagides, 96 ff. The king is commonly mentioned alone in texts referring to taxa- tion and the like; but in an honorific context such as this it is usual to refer to his consort (e.g. P. Gurob 10.5 f.) and common to refer to his children. Since we are dealing with a copy and not with an original, it is safest not to press the point; but it may be suggested that the text falls during the period from 69 to 57 in which documents do not mention the queen,20 and probably before 58, when the king went into exile (returning in 55). 11.

It relates to an assembly of fellow-farmers, avyyEopyoL, who wished to buy a plot of ground whereon to build a gymnasion and house for the doing of sacrifice for their lords. A man called Paris gave it and would not take any money; so they voted him two repre- sentations, to be wreathed on the days on which they sacrificed for the royal family, and a day of honor; if he should do them further services, they would add another day in the city, i.e. in Alexandria. Three years later they added two days, so that there were to be three, one in Alexandria, and two in Psenamosis where their farms lav. 13. 4~ATTC.

Josephus applies it to groups of not less than ten men celebrating the Passover (AJ, 3.248; BJ, 6. 423 b6arEp d Uarpla). In Asia Minor we find it used as a synonym of avyLPqoats to denote societies which drank together, visited the houses of dead members and there dined, cele- brated a pannychis for the community, gave oil to the people, and made dedications (Poland, Vereinswesen, 52 f.; Keil-von Premerstein, Zweite Reisebericht (Denkschr. Wien, 54, 2, 1911), no. 147; Buckler- Calder-Cox, Monum. Asiae Min. ant., 4,230 (Tymandos: 3rd cent. A.D.). Later it can mean conspiracy; cf. Can. 18 Conc. Chalc. (Mansi 7.389). The presence of the expression here creates a grave difficulty. It cannot relate to civic organisation, for in a Fayum town there was no such organisation, and in any case where there were civic phratriae a man was born into them and could not change them at will. Nor can it well refer to some other type of religious association in the place to which a member might at the same time belong, as in the text cited from Keil and von Premerstein, where it existed side by side with a (Dionysiac) speira, and the dead man had his place in both. Nor can it well be a subunit of the society,2' for why should a man wish to leave that of the president, which was presumably the most honored? The solution seems to be that 4p'rpa is here used as an equivalent for aivoos, simply for the sake of variety and the pleasure of using a more uncommon word.22 There was no doubt a multiplicity of similar organisations, as at Oxyrhynchus as late as 426 A.D. (Wilcken, Chr., 123) and at Talmis in the same period, where there were three (Wil- cken, Arch. Pap., 1, 1901, 411 ff.). The practice of drinking together limited effective membership; the Demotic lists indicate not more than 40 members and Poland RE, 4A, 1081 notes that avy4p3L&amp;cELs in Asia Minor on which we have information were small. So in a village in Sax- ony there were as many as four brotherhoods (M. Beth in Hoffmann- Krayer and Baichtold-Stiiubli, Handw. deutschen Abergl. 6.753 ff.). 15. y--raXooy7ceLy, if right, is a literary word which might be used in such a text for effect. Theophrastus, Char. 28, says that the evil- speaker (6 KaKoX6byo), when asked, Who is so and so, begins KaO'7rep ol ye-aXo-oV^vs; this perhaps justifies the word here, but its associa- tions are mainly with something of the Hesiodic mythological type. 21 Such as the alpia'ts of ephebe associations (Wilcken, Chr. 141-2) and pos- sibly of others (Wilcken, Abh.

In the mixed racial conditions of a Fayum town there were considerable possibilities of unpleasantness arising out of reciprocal considerations of parentage - over and above such normal amenities as Lucilius 119 ed. Marx. We had thought of A7&amp;v erXoycrELv which would recall the copious vociferations in the local senate at Oxyrhyn- chus in A.D. 270/5, e.g. P.

Very curious, for although the verb can have the derogatory connotation 'chatter,' it is usual in a neutral sense to de- scribe speech in general and in particular talk over wine. At the meetings of the Iobacchi at Athens no one was to speak without per- mission of the priest or the vice-priest, under penalty of fine (SIG, 1109.108); possibly our symposion was to take place with ritual solemnity such as was customary at Naucratis (p. 49 above). But there may be a special Egyptian emphasis in this. The 'negative con- fession' in the Book of the Dead 125 includes among the dead man's claims of innocence, 'I have not been talkative in speech' (G. Roeder, Urkunden zur Religion des alten A gypten, 276). At least a summary of this text reached the Greek-speaking world, as we see from Euphan- tus ap. Porph. De abst. 4.10 (where this clause does not, however, ap- pear). In Corp. Herm. 10.9. the good man possessed of gnosis is 6 I) 7roXX&amp; XaXcov u16?3 7roXX' 4'KO1wv. The meaning cannot be 'babble about the society's business'; for that would surely have been stated in more explicit terms. Professor Campbell Bonner suggests (Kara)XaX'ioLotV, 'backbite' which well deserves consideration. 17. KaT7rLyop C'EL means presumably at this point not that no one is to make verbal charges but that no one is to hale a fellow-member into court for anything arising out of their association in the synodos (cf. Plato, Leges, 11, p. 915E), all such causes of offence being under the jurisdiction of the president; in the Demotic parallels there is a fine for so doing; neither here nor in native Greek associations do we find any tendency of the gild to exercise such jurisdiction over other matters (San Nicolb, EIIIT., 262 ff.).22a We have a funerary founda- tion of the fourth dynasty with a clause forbidding litigation between 22a The prohibition by Paul of appeal to the courts springs from the back- ground of the life of the Judaism of the Dispersion.</page><page sequence="16">54 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW members of the priestly college which was concerned with the ful- filment of the founder's wishes, and permitting arbitration (J.

Rose suggests, LAprepe7rEepEvbe0Oa, EAp7repepvraoaOaL, or some other compound of reprwpe~5boUat, 'be talkative,' 'brag'; perhaps rightly, but such a prohibition should have come a little earlier in this text. The two letters before ErEpaY look like r'; possibly 7('v) should be read. 22. A member who became a father had probably to make some extra contribution to the club, as in the Demotic parallels (80 ff. later) and SIG, 1109.130, presumably for a celebration (San Nicolb, Vereins- wesen, 2.165). In permanent associations there was sometimes an obligation to introduce a son: cf. SIG, 1106.51; Wilcken, Chr. 110A; F. Poland, Philol. 70, 1911, 524 ffi.

IV. ZEUS HYPSISTOS The synodos is to meet in the temple of Zeus Hypsistos. What is this temple? The title Zeus Hypsistos is found at numerous points in the Greek world; so is Theos Hypsistos, and we have occasionally the plain Hypsistos referring to a god. The three are sometimes treated as equivalents. Thus a cult.conducted by worshippers (mostly women) of the lower classes at a shrine south of the Pnyx at Athens has left its mark in numerous votive inscriptions of the late first to the third century of our era, accompanied by reliefs representing parts of the body healed by the god. In these we find biarr Act or ALd bL i-rw three times, 0E4 wn/2r twice, bi4~rr eight times, and twice a dedication without divine name.23 Again, out of four 23 K. Kourouniotis, H. A.

Theos Hypsis- tos is used at Miletus in the description of a priest and of a prophetes, and though these are honorary inscriptions and not official records, and a column exists with the inscription ?obs ilolaTrov, the god thus worshipped may have been formally called Theos Hypsistos. Theos Hypsistos occurs also at Serdica in the collective act of piety of a sodality, and presumably was the official title there, as also in the societies in Bosporus and in the spot in the region of Sinope from which we have another record. But in the main the title belongs to the language of private dedications.43 On the other hand Zeus Hypsistos has a temple at Thebes, a statue at Corinth, possibly a priestess at Argos, a precinct at lasos, a priest (shared with Agathe Tyche) at Mylasa, not to mention a cult association at Edessa. The cult under this name has therefore in these places full standing. Accordingly, while a Theos Hypsistos might conceivably here and there be given the more colorful title Zeus Hypsistos - for in Hellenistic times Zeus was at times almost a descriptive term meaning 'chief god' rather than the personal name of a traditional Greek divine character 44 - it would appear that in the main the process went the other way and that where Zeus Hypsistos and Theos Hypsistos exist side by side the Zeus form is the earlier and Theos Hypsistos may be an un- official synonym for him (as elsewhere for other gods). 41 Revised readings of one text in Suppl. epigr. gr. 3.590. 42 On this, cf.

In poetry Zeus is i~,'tos," O,45 ipraroPS, and 7ravvre'praro-. These adjectives denote Zeus as the chief of gods and men. As such he can be associated with mountains: if we examine the places listed as having a cult of Zeus Hypsistos or Theos Hypsistos, we find other and explicit mountain cults of Zeus at Athens, Thebes, Olympia, Corcyra, in Macedonia, at Tralles, in Lydia, Phrygia, and Pontus.46 The epithet has this connotation in Sophocles, Trachiniae 1191 f.

But it seems as a rule to bear a more gen- eral sense of supremacy, or to refer to Zeus as sky-god (as in Soph. Philoct. 1989); Pausanias 2.2.8 tells of three images of Zeus at Corinth: one without epithet, one of him as Chthonios, one of him as Hypsistos. As Nilsson remarks (The Mycenaean origin of Greek mythology, 231), 'Zeus dwells on the mountain peak or in the heavens - these are the same - because he is the weather-god.' 47 Most of the votive inscriptions for Zeus Hypsistos and Theos Hypsistos are not dated, but perhaps the earliest known are two (identical) of Zoilus, the son of Alexander, to Zeus Hypsis- tos at Edessa, which may on grounds of lettering be referred to the first half of the second century B.C.48 The place is sug- gestive, and we have from it six dedications in all.

Bora, and in Macedon Zeus was of supreme importance as national and royal god, perhaps also as mountain-god; their society was Homeric, and Zeus may have had the standing which he has in Homer.49 The eagle which appears on one of the stelae is the traditional attribute of Zeus, and emerged at just this time on Antigonid coinage."5 Although Oriental cults had reached Macedonia by the end of the third century B.C.,51 it seems likely that this is a native cult. A dedication was addressed to the gods and not to the public, and therefore there was not in antiquity that need, which a modern man might feel, for the avoidance of ambiguity; cir- cumlocutions were used which were intelligible only to the dedicant; e.g., Orc@ 7rr7K6c, 6OE '771KcwV,52 or the god was not named at all. At the same time, the probability is that, for a Macedonian, Zeus was too national a figure, too strongly marked a personality for a foreign god to be given his name without some unmistakably distinctive epithet. The stele of able to trace the development of Macedonian lettering chronologically, thinks this text compatible with a date fairly early in the End cent. B.C.; it looks older, he says, than Ann. Brit. Sch. Ath., 18.145 (128 B.C.) and is fairly certainly later than 18.134 (ca. 240 B.C.) Mr. Edson also draws attention to the speculations of Ecphantus on the kinship of god, king, and eagle (E. R. Goodenough, Yale Classi- cal Studies, 1, 1928, 82 f.); cf. Corp. Herm. 18.16 and Cic. de diuinat. 1.96 and Pease ad loc., and in particular his reference to Arrian Anab. 9.3.3f., in which Gordios is said to have seen an eagle sitting on the yoke of his oxen, and to have been told to sacrifice to Zeus the king, and to the cult of Zeus of Bottiaea, on which cf. E. Babelon, Rois de Syrie, xi. The two griffins in the akroterion of the stele are separated from the eagle, which stands in a wreath (as on the coins struck by the mintmaster Zoilus for Perseus) under the inscription; there can be no thought of the later use of both eagle and griffin as symbols of apotheosis. In spite of the generally Oriental connections of the griffin (Cumont, Syria, 9, 1928, 102), there need be no direct relation to the East, for the griffin was familiar in these parts, as we see from the early coins of Abdera. 4 M. P. Nilsson, The Mycenaean origin of Greek mythology, 991 if., argues forcibly that Zeus is originally the one god dwelling on the mountain peak or in the heavens. 50 It is a Ptolemaic emblem from the beginning of their coinage. On the stele, as on Ptolemaic coins, the eagle faces left; on the coins of Perseus, as on the silver and bronze struck by Alexander at Amphipolis, he faces right. 51 Cf. Edson ap.

The Greek background for the epithet Hypsistos has been emphasised elsewhere; this specially Macedonian background53 deserves attention in view of its possible importance for the regions into which Macedonians went as rulers. Caria had its period of Macedonian rule;54 Stratonicea, Thyatira, and Phil- adelphia in Lydia were Macedonian colonies, and Samaria received a Macedonian settlement. After all, the chief Mace- donian deities, Zeus, Heracles and Dionysus, and the neigh- boring Cabiri did gain in influence in the age of the Successors. In view of the relatively small number of Macedonian inscrip- tions thus far published, it is remarkable to find six to Zeus Hypsistos at Edessa. Hypsistos is not precise, as was an epithet when it described the local home of a god or his specific function. In Syria Zeus Hypsistos and Theos Hypsistos were both used to describe the local Baal of a given region,55 many of them mountain gods.56 The Zeus Hypsistos worshipped on Mount Cynthus on Delos was probably of this kind (p. 58 above). In Lydia we have not only Theos Hypsistos used freely, but also Thea Hypsiste, clearly for some form of the mothergoddess;57 in Phrygia Theos mid. 1st cent.

One specialized use has attracted considerable attention. Schtirer showed that (Theos) Hypsistos was a common term in the later canonical books of the Old Testament and in the writings of hellenistic Judaism to denote the god of the Jews, and that the cult directed to Theos Hypsistos in the Bosporus was an offshoot of Judaism, in which hellenizing Jews and Judaizing Gentiles found a religious meeting-ground; he was able to point to similar coalescence in the sect of Hypsistarioi in Cappadocia in the fourth century of our era and to other analogies.60 Cumont followed this by the demonstration that there was a certain confusion between Sabaoth, wrongly taken to be a proper name, and Sabazios, and so explained the as- cription to Jews of an interest in Sabazios, the dedication by the thiasos Sebazianos at Serdica to Theos Hypsistos, and the Dionysiac scene represented on the Cyzicene relief dedicated to Zeus Hypsistos."6 These facts are of great importance; they vival of a type of Judaism such as we know at Elephantine in the text published by A. Cowley, Aramaic Papyri of the Fifth Century B.C. (note pp. xviii f.). 68 Cook, 883. 58a A. Laumonier, BCH, 58, 1934, 337 ff. 19 Perdrizet, BCH, 20, 1896, 363; add A.

Nevertheless, we may question the inference, sometimes made, that Jewish influence is to be seen in the majority of instances of Theos Hypsistos and Zeus Hypsistos. We have to allow that the term is used with greater fre- quency in Jewish writings than in others, and that it does not figure in the list given by Aristides or in other ancient lists of the epithets of Zeus. In spite of instances in earlier poetry, it had ceased to be in literary use, and the material here discussed belongs for the most part to sections of society in which the intelligentsia had little interest. We may further grant that a term might spread from Jews and Judaizers and then go to wider circles on its own merits, as at Apamea in Phrygia the type of Noah's ark found its way onto civic coinage and ap- pears on issues made by mint-masters who were responsible also for purely pagan types.62a But the use of Hypsistos had a non-Jewish background also; and while in Lydia Theos Hypsistos is not coupled in dedications with the names of other deities,63 at Alexandria Helios and the Nemeseis are invoked inscription must be identical with the TrpIOtr-fTpoE of J. R. S. Sterrett, Epigraphical journey, no. 197.] 62 When the Jews revolted in 66 A.D. there were disturbances in some but not all Syrian cities and in Alexandria, but they are not recorded elsewhere (Josephus, BJ, 2, 457 ff.: R. O. Fink, Journ. Rom. Stud. 23, 1933, 119; in 116 the troubles were in Alexandria, Cyrenaica, Mesopotamia, and Cyprus (B. W. Henderson, Five Roman Emperors, 334 ff.). Even at Alexandria earlier Philo states that large numbers of non-Jews came over to the celebration of the making of the Septuagint held on the island of Pharos every year (De vita Mosis 2. 7 sect. 41, ii p. 140/1 Mangey). 62a A.

Keil, Anatolian Studies presented to Sir William Ramsay, 263; in RE, 13, 9197 he is less confident about the explanation from Judaism. Zeus Hypsistos at Cyzicus, who has the quasi-Dionysiac relief, is coupled with other ordinary pagan deities: cf. n. 25 above. V. Parvan, Dacia, 1, 1924, 277 entered a general caveat.</page><page sequence="27">THE GILD OF ZEUS HYPSISTOS 65 after and with Theos Hypsistos,64 and the absence of other deities can be explained from the trend to henotheism which the epithet involved and which was widespread even where there was no Jewish influence. We have seen other instances of alien affiliations of the epithet Hypsistos. Contrast the Bosporan inscriptions, in which Hypsistos is coupled with pantokrator, which is far less common in contexts which are on the face of it neutral, and eulogetos, which has no chance of being Greek; a vernacular equivalent of the latter occurs in Palmyrene bilinguals coupled with the Adi l'luoT Kal EEr-7Kb KTrX.65 This god receives about 190 dedications at Palmyra, more than any other god. The worship paid to him was clearly non-Jewish, and yet the ideas associated with him could approximate to those of Judaism. Thus there is a fire altar - a thing in itself incompatible with Jewish practice - bearing the inscription 'Malchos, the son of Bareas, the son of Malichos, offers thanks to the one and only merciful god': EvbaptL7TaEL M&amp;XXos Bap'a TO7 MaXtXov il pbvc Xeildov, N4E. In fact, we are on a religious frontier.66 The religious conditions seen here have some value as an analogy for the soil from which Islam sprang. Contrast again Delos, where there is the crucial word wpo- oevx~i; contrast Thessalonica, where Ocj bgitrL KaT' iT7ra'yt is followed by the letters IOTEM, which may be an attempt to transliterate the name of Jahwe;67 contrast the tomb-inscrip- tion near Acmoneia which has the phrase ia]TaL abrcv rpbs rO', 06b' r6V i?t'aurov, which must be Jewish or Christiath.6 In such instances we see clearly the impact of Jewish or Judaizing cul- ture; perhaps we should in others, but it is not possible to be dogmatic; the ground quakes under our tread.69 It is, however, 64 Cook 889. * Cook 885 f. 6 H.

Hypsistos was a term in use, vague enough to suit any god treated as the supreme being; as Cook says (890) 'a title that any honest man could use with a clear conscience.'71 It fitted Jahwe perfectly, and Jewish and Christian writers put it in the mouths of non-Israelites who recognized their God;72 but would it suggest him to anyone except a Jew or a Judaizer? Celsus twice gives Hypsistos as a Jewish name for god - (1.93/4) 'whether Hypsistos or Adonai or Ouranios or Sabaoth or however they like to call this universe, not that there is any difference in using the Greek name Zen or the Indian name or the Egyptian name,' and (5.41) 'So I do not think that it makes any difference to call Zeus Hypsistos or Zen or Adonai or Sabaoth or, as the Egyptians do, Amoun, or, as the Scythians, Papaios.' But Celsus had to familiarize himself with biblical writings, and in the second passage he is being very precise, as is shown by the use of Amoun instead of the common Greek form Ammon. Origen, in his reply, speaks on the first occasion yet, could a Jew or Judaizer have so used the name Zeus? Possibly; we simply do not know the limits of Jewish divagation. 70 Lebas-Waddington ad no. 416 emphasize the distinction of Zeus Hypsistos at Mylasa from the three other forms of Zeus there known. 71 Note ib. 834 a dedication from the district of Cyzicus (2nd or 3rd cent.

There is a curious analogy in the Aramaic papyri from Elephantine. In them Jews commonly (not always) use to one another the phrase 'ya' u the God, but in dealing with Persians repeatedly (not always) the God of heaven or 'ya' u the God of heazen (A. Cowley, Aramaic papyri, xviii) and in no. 32.3 (according to Cowley, apparently a note by the messenger of an answer given verbally) the Persian authorities are recorded as saying 'the God of heaven' (ib. 123); but in no. 30.6 the priests of Khnub are represented as using 'ya' u the God (ib. 113).</page><page sequence="29">THE GILD OF ZEUS HYPSISTOS 67 about Sabaoth, Adonai and 'other names handed down among the Hebrews with great solemnity,' on the second about the god of Abraham, the god of Isaac, the god of Jacob, Adonai, Sabaoth, Amoun Papaios, and says nothing explicit about Hypsistos.

It is the dissemi- nation and popularity of the epithet. Is not the explanation to be sought in the tendency to concentrate powers in the hands of one deity, thought of as reigning over all from an exalted 73 Epistulae et leges, ed.

Nectarius, the pagan son of a Christian, writing to Augustine (Ep. 103) has 'cum nos ad exsuperantissimi Dei cultum compelleres' and 'Deus summus te custodiat'; P. Batiffol, La paix constantinienne et le catholicisme, 192, notes that Christian terminology accepted 'summus' but not 'exsuperantissimus.' 74 Preisendanz, P. gr. mag. 4, 1068 (of Balsames), 5.46 (of solar god), 12.63 (of lao Adonai); i4'4taros is applied to God the Father and to Christ in P.

Philo Ad Gaium 23 ? 157 (2, p. 569 M), 40 ? 317 (p. 592) are quoted as instances of Roman officials using iw'rros No6s to mean Jahwe; but in both Philo is not professing to quote verbally and is presumably using his own words. 15 The dedication and solemn kindling of lamps has been thought to point to Jewish influence but is not a clear indication, in view of the frequency with which lamps were dedicated to gods in general (Nilsson, Gott. gel. Anz., 1916, 49 ff.). A puzzling case is OGI 755/6, two inscriptions, the first mentioning a priest ro0 yL.,rhrov Oeo~N ,iorov cOrwrpoS, the second a prophetes r. a. 0. b., at Miletus, as honored by the gardeners and the associated spikers of razorfish respectively. We have no information as to the date of these texts. They may show Jewish influence - to judge from the cumulative effect of the epithets: or they may be related to the monotheistic trend of the oracle of Claros, which is credited with an interest in Jewish piety; cf. Nock, Rev. et. anc. 30.1928, 280 ff. The possibilities of coincidence are illustrated by the appearance of Kvpl4 OLG at Philippopolis with a relief of the Thracian ridergod (Suppl. epigr. gr., 3. 518). Cf. V.

If so, the epithet is on a par with 'ex- superantissimus,' 17 with the difference that it acquired a much wider usage and an existence independent of the other divine titles with which that was usually combined." There is an- other factor, applying specially to Asia Minor, and that is the popularity of somewhat vague divine titles such as theos hosios kai dikaios, theos sozon. They denote a solar god, commonly a ridergod, but there is an extraordinary fluidity of language; we find 'Oct AXLK'C,, 0 oEoti0 Kal 3LKaCt, GEc 0(To' LKatLL, O(TEcw, 'OaicO, OcEW, OEoTS 'O09[ KLl ALKaci, Oeoi's Ltois Kal 3Ka'toIs and the adjectival use of these words, as OE 6tLKaLc MLOpa, ArTro'6 oc'ovortL Kal 'HeXlo PfaLXr"t . ...6 atL6OTrTOL7 s ' 5o10loti [oTs].7S The 76 Often coupled with 'summus': Cumont, Arch.

'summus' had a wide use in Latin from early times: it is in no sense specific, though it could be adapted to the henotheistic trend (Batiffol, La paix constantinienne, 188 ff.). 77 At Pergamon we have 'HXaq 0o3 VO'ioTqy on a small altar (Cook 882); at Badin- lar in Phrygia ['A7rbX]XoW A[atpp]y3lrn[] OEc b[W lrc] (Ramsay, JHS, 10, 1889, 223); Alexander Polyhistor ap.

Attis, like Cybele, had from near the end of the third cen- tury A.D., been called omnipotent; a.r.ir. is said by Graillot, Culte de Cybble, 549 n. 6 to be 'emprunt~e h la langue des mysteres,' but the verb avvpxw is a term expressly said by Galen to belong to later Stoicism (cf. J. von Arnim, Sto. uet. fragm., 2 pp. 144 ff.; hence the use in Corp. Herm. VIII 2, XI 5, Exc. Herm. XIV 1, XV 1 ed. Scott). A smaller figure could under the stress of emotion be promoted to such rank. Thus a dedication from the territory of Rithymna in Crete (Kaibel, Epigr. gr. 815; prob. 2nd cent. A.D.) tells how Salvius Menas and his wife wor- shipped Hermes; she died, and apparently he regarded it as due to his omission of an annual sacrifice. He grieved and learnt his lesson, and in the closing couplet invoked the god as ravTroKp&amp;rWp 'EpLobvoos (the whole is reminiscent of confession- inscriptions and of the aretalogy type in general; cf. Nock, Conversion, 83 ff.). Hermes is KptLOS and awT7p in a dedication at Comana in Cappadocia (A. Souter, Studies Ramsay, 402 f.). So Priapus became a solar deity (H.

Theos Hypsistos is known in Egypt from the dedication of a Jewish proseucha in the second century B.C.,8s from another dedication of 29 B.C. in the Fayum which may be Jewish,"s and from the magic papyri.82 Zeus Hypsistos is apparently new. The practice of libation, and the description of the king as 'god and lord' go beyond anything that we can credit to a cult derived from Judaism, however denatured. Further, the phrase implies that the temple in which the meetings were to take place was a civic temple, large enough to contain a room suitable for the purpose, and not a private shrine. A Semitic cult is at least improbable. We have mentioned the possibility that the papyrus comes from Philadelphia. Excavation has there disclosed one large temple precinct, the ground plan of which shows traces which may well point to priestly dwellings, storerooms, or the like.83 Other papyri indicate the presence of a Hermaion (whether dedicated to Hermes or to Thoth), a sanctuary, with enclosing wall of Poremanres (the deified Amenemhet III),s4 and quarters named after a Boubasteion and a Harbich(ieion?), implying their presence and perhaps their consequence.85 A letter of Apollonius, the finance minister to Zeno, proves that the Sara- pieion, a temple of the Dioscuri, and another, perhaps one for the royal house, were together along the canal;86 and other 79 Cf.

Cults had to be created as part of the planning of the settlement of the Fayum. We must hope that new discoveries will throw light on the way in which this was done. We know of liberalities of the Finance Minister Apollonius to particular shrines." Many of these places of worship must have been very small. Thus P. Cairo Zen. 59308 records the payment of an annual allowance of 12 drachmae by the priest of Thoeris at some other place, perhaps Oxyrhynchus, to the priest of Thoeris at Philadelphia and states that this covered the ex- penses of sacrifice. So a text from Elephantine of 223/2 B.C. records contributions from other temples, probably for the build- ing of a temple of Horus at Edfu.92 Temples were built also by individuals and by groups of individuals; the government took an interest in these things, and its permission was neces- sary even for the restoration of shrines in private possession." 87 Viereck, Philadelphia, 14, U.

Otherwise they do not seem to have cared greatly about the shape which things took; certainly the paucity of Greek cults in the Fayum, settled as it originally was by veterans, is remarkable; for although inter-marriage with native women meant that the children would receive their early impressions from persons to whom the Greek tradition was foreign, as those children grew up they acquired Greek pride of race and might have been ex- pected to give religious expression to their nationalism in a more pronounced manner.94 Zeus Hypsistos at Philadelphia, if that is the home of this cult, may have been a god of whom we have there no other knowledge; the papyri have shown us a series of new wor- ships. But he must have had a temple of fair proportions. Perhaps he was the Zeus Labrayndaios, given in the course of time a general epithet instead of the local one. Again, he may have been Ammon. To be sure, Ammon is usually called di- rectly by his own name, which was familiar from of old to the Greeks and did not need to be replaced by an equivalent, though two early votives speak of him as Zeus Thebaios,95 94 For an instance of the first generation doing so, cf. p.72 n. 100 later. Attention should be paid to a list of festivals preserved in P. Ross. Georg. 41 (2nd cent. A.D.; edited by O. KrUger, in Zereteli-Krtiger, Papyri aus russischer u. georgischer Sammlungen, 2.188ff.).

The Delia and Demetria are purely Greek and certain festivals are distinguished by the express description Alyyvfrrlov. This looks as though it were the calendar of the aggregate of temples in a place where Greek and Egyptian elements had their place side by side. In general cf. T. A.

G. Milne suggests, the gifted Arsinoe was responsible for this and glorified Ammon in order to appeal to her native subjects.97 If this is right, Ammon may have had a fairly large temple at Philadelphia, a foundation of her hus- band's reign. To an Egyptian Ammon was 'thou greatest one of heaven, thou oldest of earth, lord of all that is, who remain- est in all things . . . of more exalted nature than any other god.'98 Celsus, in a passage quoted earlier, equated Zeus, Hypsistos, Adonaios, Sabaoth, Amoun, and Papaios.99 Nevertheless in view of the dedications from Edessa, Zeus Hypsistos may have been of Macedonian origin; there is nothing against the hypothesis of a hitherto unknown temple.100 V.

An association is in general a group which a man joins of his own free will, and which accepts him of its free will, and this mutual acceptance creates certain obligations on both parties. Ancient Greece knew associations which performed public functions in connection with worship (as the symmories did in connection with financial liabilities), and others which served private ends. There is little difference of terminology between the two, and the second imitated in various ways the forms of public life, but there is a considerable difference of function. The first were often in close relation to temples even when they had separate buildings of their own.125 The second regu- larly owned their own shrines; olKOs, which describes such a shrine, is also a frequent term for an association."12 If a cult, which thus started in a private way, acquired a public temple, the association might then retain a standing in relation to it, as did the collegium Isidis (consisting of pastophori) at Rome in the time of Apuleius; it had been founded in the time of Sulla, before the civic temple was built.127 In this cult groups 125 So the actors' gild (Poland, RE, 5A, 2540 ff.). As an instance of a society serving a public end, cf. the Iouliastai who built the heroon for C. Iulius Xenon at Thyateira between 27 and 2 B.c. (Keil-von Premerstein, Zweite Reisebericht, no. 74). 126 Professor Edgerton draws attention to the fact that the common demotic word for house is often applied to the associations discussed pp. 80 ff. later. 127 Apul.

An inscription in the new Thesmophorion at the Piraeus of the second half of the fourth century B.C. prohibits the convoking of thiasoi and making of purifications, and also access to the altar, without the consent of the priestess, except at the time of the Thesmophoria and on certain other days on which women come together in accord- ance with ancestral custom.129 A group of citizens with a special devotion to a civic deity or a civic shrine distinguishing them from their fellow citizens is something which does not square with the nature of Greek religion.13 The one significant exception is that of the men who had been initiated in a particular mystery and who in some places remained members of a group having a sort of corporate existence and corporate relation to the temple in which the solemn rites were celebrated. Such were the initiates of Diony- sus Phleus at Ephesus."31 gathered by Menneas, who made a dedication in the public Sarapeum at Delos dur- ing the Athenian period); (P. Roussel, Inscriptions de D6los, 1403; 1417A Col. II 88). 128 Cf. N. Papadakis, Arch. Delt. 1, 1915, 148 ff.; P. Roussel, Les cultes egyp- tiens A Delos, 270 f.; F. Poland, RE, 15, 408 ff. 129 Ziehen, Leges Graecorum sacrae, 33. (= IG, 2, ed. 2, 1343). This prohibi- tion does not occur in other temple regulations, and in the private shrine of Men Tyrannus at Sunium such gatherings were expressly allowed (Ziehen, ib., 49). A Thesmophorion, in view of the secret character of the rites there celebrated prob- ably had special facilities for meetings, and women at least were prone to come together for various religious occasions; cf. Aristophan. Lys. 1. In the cult of Dionysus private thiasoi existed in addition to those which had become official; so at Miletus, where there was a prohibition on the gathering of any thiasos before the public thiasos (M. P. Nilsson, in Studi e materiali di storia delle religioni, 10, 1934, 4). 130 Of course individuals as well as groups made benefactions. A text at Gerasa, of 69/70 A.D. is of interest: a porch and a pit were given to Artemis Kvpha by ol eBj#~%EOLt (C. C. McCown, Ann. Am. Sch. Or. Res., 11, 1933, 134 n. 19); the form of the dedication seems to show Semitic feeling. 131 Poland 36 ff.; Th. Wiegand, Ath.

It was simply a permanent home for an image, an altar or altars, and votive offerings.132 Contrast with this the average native precinct in the Near East, which was a complex of buildings, intended on the one hand for communal priestly life and daily ritual, on the other as a goal of pilgrimage on festal occasions, and accordingly equipped with all the facilities of a caravanserai.'33 Some at least of its features were reproduced in temples of Oriental gods in the Graeco-Roman world. Thus dining clubs of priests were common in temples in the Semitic area and religious ban- quets apparently took place in the precincts of the Syrian deities at Rome and elsewhere.'"4 It is not that no one ever ate in a Greek precinct; after private sacrifice it was sometimes obligatory to consume the flesh on the spot (presumably within the precinct): 13 public banquets were held after sacrifice at certain festivals,'36 within the Greek area as well as outside it; 137 and there were hestiatoria in or beside precincts to which rank (C. F. Edson, Harv. Stud. class. phil. 45, 1934, 226 f.). Age groups might be closely related to a temple (e.g. epheboi, and CIL, 13, 913 iuenes a fano Iouis: among the Nitiobroges), but they are so to speak a cross-section of the community. 132 S. Wide-M.

The so-called 'couch of Sarapis' was a society nominally dining with the god as its head, but it met in the temples of other deities also, and on occasion in a private house.140 The temple of Pnepheros at Theadelphia included a 'place of the association of the men who feed the geese.' 141 The precinct of Pnepheros and Petesuchos at Karanis had its deipneterion, bearing that name; this was erected in the time of Vespasian, after the dedication of the temple proper in 59/60 A.D.142 It is possible 138 Stengel, RE, 8,1315; Fiehn, ib. 5A 518; Picard, op. cit. 54; Fr.

As a matter of fact, they do not speak of this as a special privilege. Durrbach remarks, p. 143, 'un endroit banal.' Again, at Chytroi in Cyprus three thiasoi sacrificed in the temple of Apollo (M. Ohnefalsch-Richter, Ath. Mitt., 9, 1884, 137). Elsewhere throughout the Greek area there does not seem to be any clear example of the use of a public temple by a private society; apparent exceptions (Poland, 454 f.) belong to societies of the first type, that is to say to groups with a public function, such as the 'worshippers of Zeus who are of those who enter the adyton' at Sardis (Buckler-Robinson, Sardis, VII, 1, 22 pp. 47ff.; ca. 100 B.C.), and the koinon (society of festive reunion) of those who go together to Zeus Hyetios on Cos (Paton-Hicks, Inscriptions of Cos, 382; A. N. Modona, L'isola di Cos nell' antichita classica, 87 n. 8) - or to associations of priests or priestly officials. At Rome certain collegia met on occasion in public temples, but the overwhelming majority had their own shrines and buildings (J. P. Waltzing, Etude historique sur les corporations professionelles chez les Romains, 1, 210 f.; San Nicolk, 2, 144). 140 J. G. Milne, J. Eg. Arch. 11, 1925, 6ff. W. Otto, Zur Geschichte der Zeit des 6.

Some gilds in Egypt had their own shrines and quarters,144 and we are unable to estimate the relative proportions of the two types of communal life; but, at the same time, the use of structures not belonging to societies is much more prominent than in Greece and was probably predominant in small places. (b) A Greek or Roman association was commonly formed with the idea that it was to endure forever; it served what ap- peared to be permanent needs of worship, of union and of mutual benefit. Groupings of this type are known in Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt with annual officials who could continue their tenure.145 This group is established for one year.

All these peculiarities appear also in a group of Demotic texts ranging from 223 B.c. to 137/6 B.C., which preserve records of associations serving religious and social ends. The oldest which we have is a papyrus from a tomb at Medinet Ghoran of 223 B.c. which describes itself as a text of the regulations which the members of the association of the temple of Horus- Behoudti in the city-of-Souchos Pisai (?), of the district of Themistes, on the South bank of the canal Moeris in the Arsi- noite nome, have undertaken to observe. They promise to furnish portions of salt, unguent, garlands, vases of lustral water, flowers of conyza, and beer or wine, and to sit in the temple on agreed days from the twenty-fourth year in Mechir till the twenty-fifth year, end of Tybi, or 12~ months, or a year, in addition to the festival days on which the members shall agree to sit. When they meet, they are to do sacrifice for Ptolemy, Arsinoe, the Theoi Adelphoi, the Theoi Euergetai . .. for all the gods of Egypt included in the association. Further regulations deal with monthly dues, with fines for conduct contrary to the law of the society (e.g. adultery with a member's wife or false accusations of leprosy), with attend- ance at processions of the falcon, in which they are to accom- pany the 'Superior of the falcon' and the other Superiors of the corporation to the tomb of the falcon, with the giving of food and assistance to members thrown into prison or having gone into temples as penitents or recluses, with contributions for mourning and embalming, and with consolation in bereave- ment.148 We have from Tebtunis a series of regulations, made in each 4, 1917, 253 f.); for an earlier Greek association with various officers, cf.

Each begins 'the law (like our Pvblos 5 z..) on which the people of the society and the priests of the holy crocodile have agreed, saying, we will do it from - of the year x till - of the year x + 1, which makes a year. We will assemble before Suchos on feast days. We will give our con- tributions on feast days, paying them to our president; if any man do not pay, the president shall take security and shall make the man pay a fine in addition. We will make the libations and burnt offerings for their majesties (Ptolemaios and Kleo- patra . . .) together with the libations and burnt offerings for various deities. We will accompany the Suchos deities to their burial as heretofore.' There follow provisions for mutual aid as in the previous text.10o Such a society, while nominally meeting for one year, might reconstitute itself with indefinite frequency. The membership list for 158/7 is fragmentary; of nine names preserved two possibly recur among the thirty-two of 157/6 but difficulties of reading make any conclusions uncertain. What seems more important is that no. 30618, which belongs to the society whose law is preserved in no. 30619, gives accounts extending over more than nineteen months. This suggests that the society of the second of the two years was thought of as possessing effective continuity with that of the first. But Professor Edger- ton, while agreeing that the society probably possessed effec- consolation (SIG, 866 and note) - perhaps an indication of an increasing trend towards human sympathy. 149 W.

Possibly there was at times im- mediate succession of these annual formations, at times not.'51 Nevertheless, such a club was in a different position from one constituted for indefinite duration. It is hard to see any way in which it could have owned property, and in fact all funds passed through its president's hands. In some, but not in all the Demotic texts, the priests are men- tioned as a separate entity combining with that of the lay members; but there were priestly members in all of the associa- tions in question. The lists group (1) the priests, (2) lay mem- bers, (3) 'the youths,' or just (2) and (3).152 There is very close agreement in the offences for which penalties are prescribed, and close agreement in the penalties and in the amount of the contributions; this applies also to the scanty Greek fragments of the record of a society at Magdola in Ptolemaic times.'53 151 The association formed in 158/7 was to last till the month of Mesore, that of 157/6 was to commence on the second of Mesore and continue till Mesore 8 of the next year. At the same time, as between 148/7 and 138/7, we find the open- ing day shifting from Thot to the fifteenth of Pharmouthi, which is a greater gap than is to be expected from a slight running over the 365 days; perhaps there was some discontinuity; and there are slight differences in the law of 138/7. An as- sociation at Tebtunis has a 'president of the fifth year'; P. Mich. Tebt. 127, I, 20 7rjo(vy,.vc) (Trc)rr ov) (-Troys) orvv6o(v) Oeoi. The year is not regnal, for it was the sixth year of Claudius, and the expression perhaps implies that the association started on an annual basis and decided to continue as it was; but it might be loose phrasing for br' ~ir7rC Yre. In P. Mich. Inv. 1277, the law of the freedmen's gild at Tebtunis under Claudius, a y',o/ev,os is chosen for a year; but the group had some effective continuity of existence, for we read in 1. 2 KX77,E'V7TCE Sl 7r avr'7 (for -6) ' (for ol) olrro-yepampEuPot (for bro-y.) div6pes: some one had called them together. 152 Listed (not separately) with other names but not initially mentioned in the text of 138/7; initially mentioned but not separately listed in that of 180/79.

We can, however, point to certain facts which may well have a bearing on this development. First, the temples were the most important public buildings and in a high degree centres of communities. Secondly, the priesthood contained a great variety of grades, shading off from dignitaries to men of no consequence: in the Gnomon of the Idios Logos or Roman regulations for one area of public finance, pastophoroi were allowed to hold 'laymen's positions' which were not open to the priests.'"5 There seems to have been an almost sharper differ- entiation between the higher clergy and the lower clergy than between the lower clergy and the laity. The Gnomon repre- sents the rigid practice of the Romans, but it is likely that they developed existing tendencies. According to it pastophoroi were not allowed to make processions or to seize priestly posi- tions, and those who buried sacred animals were ineligible for the office of prophet and for carrying shrines and feeding sacred animals. At the same time, prophets were forbidden and pastophoroi were permitted to taste offerings from a kline (i.e., a dining club meeting in a temple). There is evi- dence of conflict between pastophoroi and priests,1'7 and the 154 Cf. San Nicol6 2, 56 f.; 1, 169 n. 5; 2, 77 f. (on the poo706s collecting taxes and the influence of administrative institutions. So at Memphis the epistates of the temple, the high priest, and the head of the pastophoroi, each had a deputy; Wilcken, UPZ, 1 pp. 44ff.). 155 The annual basis remains unexplained; for the point of departure each year is neither the named festival nor the first day of the year or of the month (themselves celebrated in temple; A.

Thirdly, the men who performed minor religious offices, whether for the cult of the dead or for the care of sacred animals, formed associations connected with the temples, perhaps with the desire of having a social solidarity comparable with that of the courses of priests called in Greek times phylai.159 Fourthly, organized lay participation in temple worship was an ancient custom; a crowd took part in the cere- monial combat at Busiris or uttered its acclamations in other dramatic worship; 160 and a rise in popular self-consciousness has been seen in the Middle Kingdom."1 A text mentioning the Pharaoh Hakoris, possibly belonging to his reign (ca. 390-78 B.c.) and on palaeographical grounds capable of being wrapaPvXaKYv 7roLELTOatL TavrTwv 7ov vrTs [ro0? ept] ]6Xov 7rco lepov (cf.

The permission in the Gnomon of the Idios Logos for Ldatrat, lay- men, to take part in a procession in Greek temples may imply a prohibition at that time or their so doing in Egyptian temples, unless a confraternity was privil- eged, though it need do no more than attend. For lay functions in connexion with a temple cf. the (perhaps military) society of the 2nd century B.C. made known by U. Wilcken, P. WTirzburg, no. 4, pp. 37 ff. 161 A. Moret, Recueil Champollion, 331 ff.</page><page sequence="47">THE GILD OF ZEUS HYPSISTOS 85 assigned to the fourth century B.c., gives some regulations of a gild of men who were bound to attend one another's funerals and who had something to do with making 'the blessings of its living Apis, the great god'; its fragmentary opening includes the phrase 'Twelve months, that is one year [again?]'; there were monthly contributions of money; a fragmentary passage may refer to mutual assistance in law suits.162 Again, workers in the Theban metropolis belonged to a gild devoted to Amenophis I, perhaps founded by him. They celebrated his festival, drink- ing before him for four full days with their wives and children.'63 So we have in our papyrus an Egyptian form of organisation. The closest Greek analogies are to be found in the eranos or society of men contributing for a common purpose and in the symposion of men who met - often on a contributory basis 164 - to make libations and to drink,165 and who accordingly sub- mitted to the rule of a president selected by themselves for that purpose; they thus secured the orderliness demanded by the solemnity of sharing cup and hymn. This habit is illustrated in Egypt by a poem found at Elephantine in a private copy of about 280 B.C., together with lyrical fragments possibly intended 162 Formerly in the possession of Monsieur S. de Ricci, and now, as he courteously informs us, in the Bibliotheque de l'Institut de France. The text was mentioned by Spiegelberg, Die sogenannte demotische Chronik (Dem. Stud. 7, 1914), 30. Professor W. F. Edgerton has kindly made available a provisional translation based on Spiegelberg's photograph and transcription. 163 J. Cernyf, Bull. inst. franq., 27, 1927, 159 ff. Professor W. F.

Private persons often made private celebrations of recognized public festivals, as we do of Christmas (cf. C. C. Edgar, Bull. Ryl. Libr., 18, 1934, 127 no. 15 for the Her- maia; P. Col.

The poem professes to be the speech of the president exhorting the group to good fellowship tempered by obedience. The lyric in its turn includes (1.9) a-'~al, a request to the president to order silence, and the exclamation, e5, Well.166 It has been suggested that the poems were copied out for the use of a group of soldiers among those stationed at Elephantine. This may be so, but it is a literary production. In any case, the differences of such a group from ours are manifest. A Greek convivial meeting might have considerable stability of membership and might be bound to a stated day, such as the twentieth, but its ordinances varied from president to president and evening to evening; it did not bear a religious title, did not have a basis in the life of the community, and did not meet in a temple. The Hellenic type of meeting did in fact obtain some considerable vogue in Egypt, appearing in the dining thiasoi of which we have accounts, and the village as- sociations are related to it.67' We can see the influence of this secularizing trend in our papyrus. After all, Zeus Hypsistos plays a curiously small part. The society is named after him and meets in his temple, and that is all we hear of him in as much of the text as is preserved. Presumably the libations and prayers 168 were addressed to him, but 'for the king' is all that is explicit. Of course, our text is an abridgment, but even so it gives us the perspective of a member. We have, of course, only part; in what is lost there may well have been regulations about mutual aid and other duties, corresponding to those which we find in the Demotic texts. The Pharaohs had always had a central position in the re- ligion of Egypt; the Ptolemies maintained, increased, and systematized this ascendancy. They showed profound respect 166 Wilamowitz-Schubart, Berl. Ki. T. 5, 2, 61 f., a reference due to Professor Schubart. 167 Cf. W. L. Westermann, J. Eg. Arch. 18, 1932, 16 ff. For dining clubs cf.

Not a few may have felt like the writer of Corpus Hermeticum 4, 7, who says of men who choose bodily things that 'just as processions pass through our midst, not able to achieve anything, but getting in the way of some people, so these men do but move in a processional way through the world, being escorted by bodily pleasures.' VI. CONCLUSIONS The prohibitions in this as in other texts relating to ancient clubs indicate the perils which threatened table-fellowship and illustrate the disorders of the Corinthian Eucharist.'70 This document is of particular significance as showing how an Egyp- tian mode of corporate life passed from the native-speaking to the Greek-speaking and met the demands of piety, of loyalty, of good fellowship, and of local pride; it shows also the advance of secularization. It comes from an age of transition. The Greek element had, it seems, in the main lost its virtue; the Egyptian had reasserted itself since Z17 B.C., but had no leader- ship. Cleopatra might have united Greek and Egyptian;'" after Actium there weighed on both alike the heavy yoke of Roman rule which must needs make the government of Egypt pay. It was reserved for the bishops of Alexandria and the monks of the desert to make a new unity."72 S69 P. Tebt. 5, 945 ff.

For Corinth we may note that, according to Hermias ap. Athen. 4 p. 149F, in the three sacred annual dinners of the men of Naucratis (p. 49 above) certain food and drink were given to all in the prytaneion, and those eating there were not allowed to bring in any eatables from outside. 171 Cf.

Casey in Jackson-Lake, Beginnings of Christianity, 5, 153 n., remarks on the unconvincing nature of the Greek literary evidence. Nevertheless, the temple shown on the coins of Neapolis from the time of Antoninus Pius must have been pagan.
