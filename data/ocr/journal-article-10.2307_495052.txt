<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Journey of the Mind: The Basic Allegory in Hou Xiyou ji* Xiaolian Liu Washington- University Hou Xiyou ji p&amp; E i- (The Later Journey to the West) by an anonymous author of the late Ming (A.D. 1368-1644) or early Qing (A.D. 1644-1911) period, was written as a sequel to Xiyou ji N*p , or The Journey to the West, the famous classic Chinese novel generally attributed to the Ming author Wu Cheng'en *At, (ca. 1510-82).' Based loosely on the historical journey by the Tang Buddhist monk Xuanzang -t- (602-644), The Journey to the West tells the story of Tripitaka and his disciples on a pilgrimage to obtain Buddhist scriptures in the Western Paradise. In this sequel, a younger generation of pilgrims takes another journey to the Holy Mountain in search of the true interpretation of the scriptures. Hou Xiyou ji is one of the earliest full-length Chinese allegorical novels, but its significance has always been overshadowed by the tremendous success and popu- larity of the original Journey to the West. In the three hundred years since its publication, Hou Xiyou ji never caught the fancy of critics, who traditionally treated all sequels with disdain and viewed them as wretched imitations by second- or third-rate writers. There is no denying that Hou Xiyou ji pales by comparison with the parent novel in terms of its rhetoric, plot and characterization. But this should not prevent us from recognizing the artistic and literary achievement of the sequel. Despite the use of similar structural pattern and almost identical characteristics for the pilgrims, the author of Hou Xiyou ji displays immense imagination and originality not inferior, in many instances, to that of Wu Cheng'en: it constructs events and * I wish to express my deep gratitude to Professors Robert E. Hegel and William H. Matheson of Washington University, and to the anonymous CLEAR reviewers for reading my manuscript and making valuable comments and suggestions. 1Like so many Chinese popular novels of the Ming and Qing periods, the authorship of Hou Xiyou ji still remains a mystery. Lu Xun ~ acknowledges that the novel "makes no mention of the author," but seems to believe the book was written in the late Ming period when he discusses it briefly in the chapter "Ming Dynasty Novels About Gods and Devils." See Lu Xun (Lu Hsun), A Brief History of Chinese Fiction, trans. Yang Hsien-yi and Gladys Yang (Beijing: Foreign Languages Press, 1959), p. 207. But Sun Kaidi -* and many other critics hold the view that the novel was composed in the early Qing period. See Sun Kaidi, Zhongguo tongsu xiaoshuo shumu 4 .~,i/JA 0 (1933; rpt.

For example, each adventure in the Hou Xiyou ji journey is designed with a unique and ingenious plot to illustrate a particular concept of spiritual significance. The author of the sequel also demon- strates his talent and narrative skill in portraying an array of impressive human or demonic adversaries with distinctive features and exemplary attributes. They represent symbolically either abstract qualities, i.e. vices, desires and emotions, or certain types of people in society, and they are endowed with a sense of reality necessary to arouse the immediate interest and emotional involvement of his reader. However, the literary achievement of Hou Xiyou ji lies not only in its artistic structure and expressiveness, but also, and more important, in its uniqueness as a didactic novel written in a symbolic mode of composition. This mode was not unfamiliar to Chinese authors and writers, but it had seldom been employed extensively and continuously in popular novels or other fictional writings. Most contemporary critics of Hou Xiyou ji accept the fact that the novel is more than a fantastic tale of gods and demons or a satire reflecting the author's indignation at the corrupt and heretic religious practices. They recognize the work as a didactic fiction, which goes beyond exposing and ridiculing the social evils of the time and tries to enlighten the reader with theological wisdom. But when com- menting on the moral or religious themes of the novel, they are more interested in the author's ideas directly stated in a didactic or philosophizing manner, rather than those conveyed in an indirect or allegorical way through the vehicle of symbolic methods. By neglecting the use of allegory as a fundamental form of expression in the novel, most recent critics have not been able to comprehend fully the symbolic structure of its episodes, or the significance of the work in general. As a brilliant example of the Chinese allegorical novel, Hou Xiyou ji succeeds in telling a tale which is meaningful and significant on the symbolic level, as well as interesting and esthetically satisfying on the literal level. Through the analysis of the narra- tive techniques and subject matter of the novel, we hope to enhance our under- standing of allegory as a symbolic mode of composition in the Chinese literary tradition. In this essay, I intend to discuss allegorical aspects of Hou Xiyou ji by examining closely the episodes concerning the Little Stone Monkey in the first four chapters of the novel. The sequel to The Journey to the West begins with clear references to the Chan (Zen) Buddhist conception of the Mind as the source of all existence, which becomes the dominant theme of the novel and also provides the key to the allegorical interpretation of the fictional descriptions of incidents and characters. While the main journey itself is a symbolic representation of the Chan Buddhist version of self-cultivation, the first section of the novel is devoted to the exploits and adventures of the Little Stone Monkey, which correspond to the Taoist practices involving internal alchemy. The "heretical" practice of Taoist meditation is ultimately subverted in favor of the purely Buddhist message that a man is instantly enlightened when he sees into his Buddha-nature or Self-nature. This experience of the novel's most prominent hero serves as a prelude to the coming events and a starting point for the psycho- logical journey of Chan Buddhist salvation described in the main body of the novel. Although the novel is essentially a Buddhist allegory, the exploits of the Monkey in the early episodes constitute an allegorical Taoist quest. By tracing this Taoist</page><page sequence="3">LIU A Journey of the Mind 37 section to the point of its subversion in Chapter 4, this study will illustrate the author's control of the narrative form: he invents a completely allegorical plot and he uses a symbolic mode to achieve multiple meanings at both literal and allegorical levels. Entitled "The Later Spring Flows from the Source of the Mind in the Flower- Fruit Mountain; The Little Sage Realizes the Previous Cause at the Water-Curtain Cave," Chapter I of Hou Xiyou ji opens with a riddle in the form of a song: I have a statue of Buddha, whom nobody knows; He needs no molding or carving; He is not made of clay or painted with color; No human can draw him; no thief can steal him; His appearance is originally natural, and his clarity and purity are not from cleaning; Though only one body, he is capable of transforming into a myriad forms. (p. 1)2 The answer to the riddle is found in the famous Chan Buddhist maxim: The very mind is Buddha (Jixin ji Fo ?p l P t* ). In the Chan classic Tanjing It A (The Platform Scripture), Hui Neng * A, (638-713), the Sixth Patriarch and founder of the Southern School of Chinese Chan Buddhism, tells his followers: There is Buddhahood in my own mind. This Buddhahood in oneself is the real Buddha. Without the Buddha-mind, Where can one seek the Buddha? 3 The concept of "See one's nature and become a Buddha (Jianxing cheng Fo 3i 'I? ~&amp; ) constitutes the most important message in The Platform Scripture, and becomes the guiding principle in the doctrines of enlightenment of the Southern School of Chan Buddhism. Chan Buddhists insist that the human mind is capable of reaching Buddhahood and attaining great wisdom, because man is originally pure and natural. Opposing conventional methods of meditation and worship, such as reciting scriptures, making offerings or praying to Buddha, Hui Neng and his disciples believe that men do not have to seek salvation through any external medium, because Buddha-mind or Buddha-nature is inherent in all men. Reflecting the view of Chan Buddhism, the opening song implies that the Buddha, which "I" or everybody has, is not the carved statue or painted figure that people worship and pray to in temples and monasteries. It presents the reader with seemingly paradoxical statements, in order to illustrate certain profound principles. In fact, the author of Hou Xiyou ji might have been inspired by an anecdote of Hui Neng who tries to enlighten his disciples with a riddle: The Patriarch (Hui Neng) asked his disciples: "I have a thing that has no head or tail, no first name or alternative name, no back or face. Do you know what it is?" The Master (Shen Hui) answered: "It is the primary source of all Buddhas, and Shen Hui's Buddha nature."4 2Hou Xiyou ji (Shenyang: Chunfeng wenyi chuban she, 1981) has no English version, and all the quoted texts from the novel are my own translations. 3Wing-tsit Chan, trans., The Platform Scripture (New York: St. John's University Press, 1963), p. 143. 4 Dao Yuan ~.

Shen Hui # (686-760) was Hui Neng's disciple and later succeeded him as the Seventh Patriarch.</page><page sequence="4">38 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 13 (1991) Like Hui Neng and other Chan masters, the author of Hou Xiyou ji tries to enlighten those who fail to see their own nature and to realize that the real Buddha is within themselves. The embedded message in the song is therefore the theological basis of all Chan Buddhist teachings, that people all possess Buddha-mind and are capable of becoming Buddha. The novelist uses the opening song to announce the theme of his book and to prepare the reader for the mental or spiritual journey he is going to undertake through the reading. As indicated in the song, the theme and subject of the novel are concerned with the self-nature and transformation of the human mind in the light of religious, particularly Buddhist, enlightenment and salvation. Thus the song serves as a key for the reader to the thematic concerns of the author and an allegorical interpretation of the text. The song ends with an enlightening emphasis on the transformable nature of the "Buddha," and thus reveals to the reader that all the characters, events and phenomena in the story are the products of the mind in different forms. The author introduces the theme of his story in the form of a riddle. By so doing, the novelist wants to make sure that the reader is aware of the allegorical nature of his various episodes and is ready to apply the same technique he would employ in solving a riddle to the reading of the novel, i.e. to go beyond the literal level of the text in order to find the solution or to decipher the intended message. The hundred-chapter edition of the "parent" novel The Journey to the West begins with the story of Sun Wukong -~A$-W , the Monkey King, which functions as "an extended prologue to the narrative proper."' In restructuring the antecedent materials, the author of The Journey to the West devotes the first eight chapters to the legendary career of the hero: his mythic birth, his attainment of immortality, his heroic deeds when making havoc in the Ocean, in Hell and in Heaven, and his final submission to the power of the Buddha. Many critics have pointed out that the prologue story of the Monkey is intended as a structural model for the pattern of the forthcoming journey: "a mini-quest for salvation complete with many of the motifs later developed, in a kind of parody of the enlightenment process."6 Follow- ing the structural pattern of the parent story, the sequel Hou Xiyou ji starts with a similar mini-quest/journey of another monkey king, Sun Lizhen -A# . The adven- tures of this descendent of Sun Wukong form the basis and starting point for the author's allegorization of the Chan Buddhist doctrine that Buddhahood (which stands for Truth, Perfection, Salvation, or the final goal of Buddhism) is only attained through the proper cultivation of one's own mind. Sun Liizhen comes into the world the same way as Sun Wukong in The Journey to the West. He is born from an egg produced from an immortal stone on top of the famous Flower-Fruit Mountain, which constitutes an important symbol of the central axis of the universe, often found in many different myths and religious beliefs.7 The symbolism of the mountain as the center of the world, from which 5Andrew Plaks, Four Masterworks of the Ming Novel: "Ssu-ta ch'i-shu" (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1987), p. 187. 6 Ibid., p. 209. 7For discussion of the symbolism and meaning of the center of the world in myths and religions, see Mircea Eliade, The Sacred &amp; the Profane: The Nature of Religion, trans.

Trask (New York: Harcourt, 1959), pp. 36-42.</page><page sequence="5">LIU A Journey of the Mind 39 the universe was born and developed, is expressed through its images as a meeting place of all cosmic forces and "a universal pillar, axis mundi, which at once connects and supports heaven and earth."' The Flower-Fruit Mountain is thus a cosmic mountain, which functions as a link between earth and heaven. In Hou Xiyou ji, it is described as xianhuan fudi l ih ~ k (the Immortal World and the Blessed Land). As the birth place of the Monkey, this paradise and sanctuary from chaos and contamination symbolizes the original pure and innocent state where the Mind comes into being. The image of the immortal stone and the stone egg from which both monkeys are born is exactly that of the cosmic egg, which appears in mythologies world-wide.9 In discussing the mythological conception of the cosmogonic cycle, Joseph Campbell points out: "Not uncommonly the cosmic egg bursts to disclose, swelling from within, an awesome figure in human form. This is the anthropomorphic personification of the power of generation."'o Sun Luizhen comes into existence in exactly the same manner: (When the stone egg) split into halves, a stone monkey jumped out. Endowed with fully developed features and limbs, he was immediately able to walk. (p. 2) The birth of the monkey constitutes a theme recurrent in the myths of creation. Thus he is himself a manifestation of creative power and process in the cosmogonic cycle. For the author of the novel, he also represents the original and innocent human mind. As the Bare-Armed Monkey tells the other monkeys: "Though he is now unenlightened, he has the divine light within himself. His original capacity allows him to follow his own nature and expand the Way. If his original state is damaged and mixed up with human desires, he will disrupt heaven and earth, and cause irremediable disorder" (p. 3). These remarks precisely express the main theme of the early chapters of Monkey's adventures; they become a prophecy to be fulfilled through future events and illustrate the author's Chan Buddhist views on human nature. Since Chan Buddhism is mostly concerned with the mind or the inner nature of man, it is only natural for the author of Hou Xiyou ji to make his protagonist, Monkey, the central metaphor for the Mind, which in a synecdochic way represents the Human Being, in order to render his Chan Buddhist vision of sudden enlighten- ment.I" Metaphors relating the monkey to the mind were not the author's own invention. The symbolic expression "Monkey of the Mind, Horse of the Will (xinyuan yima i ,?4 )" became a familiar allusion and appeared frequently in both Buddhist and Taoist literature during and after the Tang Dynasty. 12 In Wu Cheng'en's 8Ibid., p. 36.

" The term xin ri (heart) is usually translated as "mind," since the Chinese used to believe that heart was the organ or the part of human being which thinks, perceives and feels. 12 For the study of the sources and early uses of the metaphor, see Dudbridge, The Hsi-yu chi: A Study of Antecedents to the Sixteenth-Century Chinese Novel (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1970), pp. 168-172.</page><page sequence="6">40 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 13 (1991) hundred-chapter novel, the expression "Monkey of the Mind" appears throughout the text, particularly in chapter titles and philosophical verses. The author unmistakably and repeatedly uses the phrase xinyuan (Mind-Monkey) to refer to Sun Wukong and thus assigns him the role of a personified image of the restless and unrestrained human mind, which has to be stilled and controlled in the process of self cultivation.13 In the sequel Hou Xiyou ji, Sun Lizhen not only resembles Sun Wukong in his appearance and character, he also inherits the metaphorical character and allegorical function of his literary ancestor. In the chapter titles and verses interspersed throughout the novel, this descendent of the Monkey King is also, though not so frequently, referred to as xin yuan ),NQ . 14 As the title of Chapter I suggests, he is the offspring of xinyuan , iS (the source of the mind), which is a pun on xin yuan , ?* (the monkey of the mind). " When he is born, the stone monkey is described as "endowed with the essence of the Divine Platform and the Square Inch," two variant names for the mind, and "nourished by the Slanting Moon and Three Stars," the pictorial description of the character xin , .16 After he is told of the story of his ancestor, who calls himself "Qitian dasheng *j k - _ (Great Sage Equal to Heaven)," this new monkey king follows the example by giving himself the title "Qitian xiaosheng Y_ R (Lesser Sage Equal to Heaven)." According to Taoist beliefs, the structure of the human body is an exact copy of the universe in miniature: The Great Way gave birth to Heaven and Earth, which are positioned up and down, eighty-four thousand ii i apart... The distance between a person's heart and kidneys is eight cun ?- and four fen ?)-. Yin and yang (in the human body) rise and fall, not different from Heaven and Earth. 17 In Taoist physiology, the heart (mind) is equal to Heaven, i.e. it has the same position and function in the human body as those of Heaven in the universe. In one of his 13Monkey King is referred to as xinyuan in the titles of Xiyou ji Chapters 8, 14, 30, 34, 35, 36, 41, 46, 51, 56, 75, 80, 81, 83, 85, 88. In addition, xinshen ,,* , Mind-Spirit or God (Chapter 76) and xinzhu iJ~. Mind-Master (Chapters 69, 73) are also used to identify Sun Wukong. 14 For example, Chapter 9 ("The Mind Monkey Seeks the Horse of the Will") and Chapter 33 ("Threads of Passion Fail to Fasten the Mind Monkey"). 15The term xinyuan , t~ (the Mind Source) is probably of Buddhist origin. As recorded in Jingde chuandeng lu, when Dao Xin itJf5 (580-651), the Fourth Patriarch of Chan Buddhism, was asked about the Truth, he replied: "All schools of the Law find their way to the Square Inch (fangcun ;k , i.e. the Mind); all rivers and sand of wonderful virtues come from the Source of the Mind (xinyuan i t )." (Dao Yuan, Jingde chuandeng lu, Vol. 4, p. 4). The term also appears frequently in Taoist texts on internal alchemy. Taoists believe that "the mind (xin i\" ) is the source of the (body) fluid (ye a" )," and "if the Mind Source is clean and clear, the fluid will produce true fire," which, when combined with true water, become gold elixir, the final stage of achieving immortality.

The equation and analogy to Heaven indicate the importance Taoists attached to the mind as the generative and controlling force in human behavior and therefore the most decisive factor in the process of spiritual cultivation. In the novel Hou Xiyou ji, the author lets the Monkey King choose for himself the title "Lesser Sage Equal to Heaven" and thus identifies him with the mind of a human being, who is to go through a journey symbolic of the process of Taoist spiritual alchemy. Following the structural pattern of the parent story, the sequel begins with episodes concerning the Little Stone Monkey, who goes through the process of Taoist internal alchemy (neidan A fA- ) to obtain immortality. 19 As in the human world, the Monkey's desire for eternal life results from his awareness of the transient nature of all mortals: One day an old fellow monkey suddenly died. Witnessing his death, the Little Stone Monkey was filled with deep sorrow. He asked other monkeys: "Yesterday he was still with us eating and walking. How come he is now unconscious and unable to move?" The others told him: "He passed away, because he had lived many years and his energy and blood had dried up." The Little Stone Monkey said: "If this is true, all of us will die sooner or later. Will our life be wasted then?" The monkeys said: "That is only natural, of course." From then on the Little Stone Monkey appeared miserably unhappy. He often asked the other monkeys: "Is there any way we can avoid death?" They replied: "If you don't want to die, the only way is to become an immortal and live a long life." ... Though after listening to these words the Little Stone Monkey kept silent, he cherished the intention of becoming an immortal. (p. 4) In the original story, Sun Wukong faced the same dilemma, when he realized that "old age and physical decay in the future will disclose the secret sovereignty of Yama, King of the Underworld," and wondered: "If we die, shall we not have lived in vain...?" (Vol. I, p. 73) In Hou Xiyou ji, the Little Stone Monkey becomes a symbolic figure of Everyman who voices the universal concern over the impermanence of human life, and expresses the yearning, in the Taoist context, to overcome the process of ageing and attain the status of eternal life as an immortal. In Chapter 2, "Failing to Find the Right Way in the Heretical Sect, (the Little Stone Monkey) Returns to Discover the True Master," the descendent of Sun Wukong starts his symbolic journey of self-realization and self-cultivation by following the footsteps of his ancestor. He goes abroad on a raft to search for the way of immor- tality, and after wandering for a period of time without success, finally ends up in 18Zhang Boduan, Wuzhen pian in Wuzhen pian zhu hekan F # A, -ij] ed.

The Little Stone Monkey is told that an immortal by the name of the Patriarch Wuzhen I (Awaken to the Truth) possesses the great power and wisdom of the Way. At the gate of the Temple of Triple Kinship (cantong ~- J ), he is stopped by a Taoist who refuses to let him see the Patriarch, on the grounds that he first must undergo some preliminary procedures. As the Taoist explains: When those who want to become immortals come here, they must first calm their minds in the Hall of Calming the Mind, then proceed to the Hall of Nourishing the Breath to regulate their breaths. When these are done, they can drive the Dragon and harness the Tiger, go from the Cinnabar Field and the Divine Mansion, directly cross the Vortex of the Cloaca, and charge through the Vertebral Strait. Only after tihu is poured onto their heads, will they be allowed to see the Patriarch. (p. 14) As in many Taoist writings, the process of internal alchemy, which often consists of meditation and respiratory exercises, is here explained in metaphorical terms. The Cinnabar Field (dantian 9-- I ), the Divine Mansion (lingfu IAff ), the Vortex of the Cloaca (weilii ~~Rl ), and the Vertegral Strait (jiaji A# ) all refer to the places in the human body which are believed to be on the path that qi (breath, energy or life force) travels in the practice of cultivating inner elixirs.20 It was believed that pouring tihu 0i , a reddish spirit skimmed from boiled butter, on one's head could keep one's mind and body cool, and therefore dispel worries. Tihu guanding fSmji I A is used as a metaphor for enlightenment or awakening to perfect wisdom. The Little Stone Monkey is first led to the Hall of Calming the Mind, which is located "right in the center of the temple, on the Divine Platform." Once inside the Hall, the Monkey finds himself surrounded by darkness and walls without any windows. He becomes restless but cannot find the door or the way out. Finally he convinces himself to sit down, "looking into his mind with his own mind, and dwelling upon divine thoughts" (p. 15). The first step and the most important procedure in internal alchemy is the cultivation of the Mind (lianxin ~t~ ) or medita- tion, which is intended to cleanse one's mind of emotions and desires. What the Little Stone Monkey does in the Hall of Calming the Mind is a standard Taoist meditation technique called "neiguan cunxiang p? V4, (Look inward and preserve thoughts)." The method requires the person to sit in a meditation room and close his eyes, ears and mind to outside interference. Then he should examine his own mind and keep thinking of divine images, such as celestial creatures, objects and scenery, so as to make his mind peaceful and cut off emotional ties with the secular world. When the Little Stone Monkey enters the Hall of Calming the Mind, he is looking at his own mind in an unenlightened state symbolized by the darkness. After a long period of time, he begins to feel a change: 20The Cinnabar Field is the region three inches below the navel. The Divine Mansion refers to the heart (mind). The Vortex of the Cloaca and the Vertebral Strait are located respectively at the end and the middle of the spinal column. These locations in the human body also have their geographical counterparts in Taoist cosmology or mythology. For example, weilii is believed to be the cosmis claoca in the middle of the Eastern Ocean, into which all the rivers in the world everlastingly pour.</page><page sequence="9">LIU A Journey of the Mind 43 When he opened his eyes, the chamber suddenly lightened, and he could see his hair clearly... At first there was only light. Several days later, he felt a stream of divine air in the bright light, which illuminated his whole body. (p.15) This is the phenomenon of xushi shengguang &amp; I &amp; ) (Empty chamber generates brightness), a sign of enlightenment in Taoist internal alchemy. The empty chamber in this case represents the mind free of all emotions, and the light in the chamber indicates the compounding of true essence (jing # ), breath (qi A ) and spirit (shen # ), whose return to their primary state is considered essential to recapture the innocent nature of man. Thus the experience of the Monkey signifies the illumination or enlightenment of the mind, the first and most important step on the way to immor- tality in Taoist internal alchemy. After the Little Stone Monkey leaves the Hall of Calming the Mind, he follows the Taoist to the Hall of Nourishing the Breath: The Hall of Nourishing the Breath was not in the temple, but on the mountain. Though it was only one room, the Monkey didn't know how many stories there were, once he was inside. The path was full of twists and turns, and it was impossible to find the way they came. When he looked back, the Taoist had already tightly closed the door. On the door, there were two big holes on each side, which served as entrance and exit. Since the Little Stone Monkey had learned the method of calming his mind, he quietly sat there, watching yin and yang air coming and going like shuttles. At the time of midnight, noon, morning and evening, he felt with keen pleasure the movement of yin and yang, with the upper air descending and the lower one rising. After sitting there continuously, he felt his whole body relax and become lighter. (p. 16) Yangqi *j4 (Nourishing the breath, or energy) is an important procedure in Taoist internal alchemy, because cultivation of the body (lianxing ~jf ) merely enables one to live (a long life) in this world, and only through the cultivation of breath (lianqi * ) can he become an immortal. According to the Inner Elixir theory, the attainment of immortality is achieved through respiratory exercises that circulate and thus nourish the breath, a technique closely associated with the Taoist concept of the body-microcosm. Like the two breaths of the cosmos, inhalation, the living breath, contains the essence of yang and corresponds to the period from midnight to noon, while exhalation, the dead breath, the essence of yin and the period from noon to midnight. By inhaling air at the "time of the living breath," the Taoist adept can make the life force or energy circulate throughout his body and thus nourish it with the essence of yang. The description of the Monkey's experience in the novel is exactly that of the respiratory exercise called neiguan A  (Inward Vision). Similar to the technique used in meditation, the adept "sees the inside of his own body and, concentrating his thought, steers the breath and guides it, following it by sight through all the veins and passages of the body."21 The Little Stone Monkey's trip to the Hall of Nourishing the Breath and his experience there represent the inside vision of the breath circulating through the passages inside the human body. In the first stage of 21 Henri Maspero, Taoism and Chinese Religion, trans. Frank Kierman (Amherst, Mass.: The Univer- sity of Massachusetts Press, 1981), p. 342.</page><page sequence="10">44 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 13 (1991) the process of developing the immortal body, breath is guided to the Lower Cinnabar Field, or Ocean of Breath (qihai 1LK3 ), symbolized by the dark room where the Monkey nourishes his breath. The significance of the respiratory exercise lies in the fact that Taoists believed that man's body is made of the impure breaths, which he has to replace with pure breaths in order to become immortal. When the Monkey continues the practice of respiration, he "feels his whole body relax and become lighter," a sign indicating that his mortal body, heavy and impure, is being replaced by vital, pure breath; he is thus becoming light and immortal. The practices of meditation and respiration are two essential and interdependent techniques in Taoist internal alchemy, because mind and breath are believed to be closely related. In Taiyi jinhua zong zhi *k E E I (The Secret of the Golden Flower), an ancient Taoist alchemical text attributed to Lii Dongbin, the author says: Breathing comes from the heart. What comes out of the heart is breath. As soon as the heart stirs, there develops breath-energy. Breath-energy is originally trans- formed activity of the heart. When our ideas go very fast they imperceptibly pass into fantasies which are always accompanied by the drawing of a breath, because this inner and outer breathing hangs together like tone and echo. Daily we draw innumerable breaths and have an equal number of fantasies. And thus the clarity of the spirit ebbs away as wood dries out and ashes die.22 The Chinese character for "breath" (xi A, ) is made up of zi j ("self" or "from") and xin ,i4 (heart/mind). Thus "breath" can be interpreted as "coming from the mind" or "having its origin in the mind."23 In the novel the breath journey of the Little Stone Monkey starts from the Hall of the Calming the Mind in the temple, which represents the human mind, and proceeds to the Lower Cinnabar Field, three inches below the navel. Since the mind affects the circulation of breath and vice versa, the adept cannot regulate his breath without a steady mind nor can he calm his mind without regulating his breath. Therefore the purpose of the respiratory exercise is not only to vitalize the body with pure, living breath, but also to concentrate the mind by eliminating fantasies or "wild ideas." When the Little Stone Monkey has completed the session of nourishing breath, he is eager to go to the next stage. The Taoist who thought the procedures would baffle the monkey is rather jealous of his success and tells him that he must wait for the Patriarch to teach him the secret of cultivation. One day while playing on the mountain, he sees in the back garden of the temple an old lady with some beautiful girls, all dressed in fancy colorful clothes. When he asks a Taoist boy who they are, he is told: To cultivate yourself and become an immortal, you have to give birth to the Baby and use the Yellow Dame and Elegant Ladies. That old lady is the Yellow Dame, and those young girls are the Elegant Ladies. They are the Furnace and Medicine Vessels of the Patriarch.

In the process of respiratory practice, according to Taoist alchemical theory, "Breath cleaves together and becomes essence; essence is set in motion and becomes spirit; spirit is transformed and becomes The Child (ying'er). The Child rises and becomes The Perfected (zhenren R ). The Perfected ascends and becomes The Infant (chizi *-- )."24 These are the different stages of what is called Embryonic Respiration (taixi Af,. ), the principle of which is to repro- duce the respiration of the embryo in its mother's womb and thus return man to his original innocent state. The whole process of the respiratory practice which generates True Breath, zhenqi A (or One Breath, yiqi - - ) by combining yin and yang is, in a metaphorical sense, like the pregnancy and birth of ying'er, the Baby, who then grows up to be zhenren, the Perfected or True Man, who has transformed his original, earthly form into an immortal being. In the Taoist practice of external alchemy, the "Elegant Lady" and the "Golden Fellow (jingong kl&amp; )" are used to represent the two prime materials, mercury and lead, for the preparation of gold elixir, and the Yellow Dame is earth which acts as the matchmaker or catalyst to cause them to unite as one.25 The same symbolism, imagery and metaphor are also used to represent the processes and the principles of internal alchemy (through respiratory exercise): they equate the human body with the furnaces and cauldrons, and breath or energy with the ingredients in external alchemy. In many Taoist alchemical texts, metaphorical terms and phrases like the "Elegant Lady", the "Golden Fellow", the "Match Maker", "marriage", "husband and wife", "pregnancy", the "birth of the Baby" are frequently adopted to help define and explain the invisible, often complex, relationships between the two prime contrary materials (yang and yin or masculine and feminine) of the Taoist internal alchemy. In Hou Xiyou ji, the Patriarch takes these metaphorical terms and expressions of Taoist internal alchemy literally. With the aid of the Yellow Dame, the matchmaker, he engages in sexual practices with young girls and uses them as the "furnace and medicine vessels" to attain the elixir of immortality. In the earlier stages of Taoism during the Han period, sexual practices were an important part of the alchemical procedures to harmonize both the yin and yang aspects of the essence (semen) in the human body, which reflects the cosmic unity of Heaven and Earth. Known as 24 Poul Andersen, trans., The Method of Holding the Three Ones: A Taoist Manual of Meditation of the Fourth Century A.D.

Located at the central position among the five elements (wuxing ff ), earth is associated with the color yellow, and is believed to be the mother of all creation. In Cantong qi A jX . (The Kinship of the Three), the earliest extant book on Chinese alchemical theory (dated about the year 142 A.D.), Wei Boyang 1h * states: "[The element of] earth, ruling the four seasons, connects the beginning with the end like a thread. Each of the (four) colors, green [wood], red [fire], white [metal], and black [water], occupies a region. They are all directed from the Central Palace [of Earth]." See Lu-chiang Wu and Tenney L. Davis, "An Ancient Chinese Treatise on Alchemy Entitled Ts'an T'ung Ch'i," ISIS, 18 (1932), p. 233. In Taoist alchemy, terms such as Huangpo (Yellow Dame, the matchmaker), Huangzhong 4 (Yellow Center) or Huangting &amp;r (Yellow Court), are used to signify earth because of its generative power and its power of regulating yin and yang. See Tenney L. Davis and Chao Yiin-ts'ung, "Four Hundred Word Chin Tan of Chang Po-tuan," Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 73, No. 13 (July, 1940), p. 373.</page><page sequence="12">46 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 13 (1991) the "Bedroom arts (fangzhong shu gt # V)" or the "Arts of Yin-Yang," they were practiced to "develop the Essence, to husband it, to keep it, and finally to unite the yin and the yang in order to obtain the results of curing illness and prolonging life."26 Earlier Taoists believed that with proper techniques of sexual intercourse one could benefit from the harmony of yin and yang and join Spirit and Breath to nourish the vital Essence. But from the Six Dynasties on, sexual procedures as a physical and external means to attain immortality gradually fell out of favor, and the internal or spiritual cultivation which was practiced within one's own body became more popular. In the Ming and Qing periods, the Bedroom Arts of sexual performance were considered "unorthodox and devious practice" by most Taoist alchemists and believers. Thus the portrayal of the Taoist Patriarch is the author's satire on the behavior of those corrupt and phony Taoists who indulged themselves in licentious practices under the guise of religion and, worse still, led people astray with their false and heretical beliefs. When the Little Stone Monkey discovers the truth about the Taoist Patriarch, he leaves the temple without saying farewell. He travels far and wide to seek for the Truth and to find the Way to immortality, only to be disappointed by the hypocrisy and greed of various religious practitioners. Finally he returns to the Flower-Fruit Mountain to find his own solution. At the back of the mountain, he finds a cave called "Wulou dong * ~A J (No-Leak Cave)": (The cave) was none other than the spiritual outlet of the Flower-Fruit Mountain. The entrance was a small opening, and the inside was pitch-dark. Nobody knew how deep it was, or dared to go down. (p. 18) The Monkey jumps into the cave and starts to calm his mind by practicing meditation in the darkness. After seven days, the cave is suddenly illuminated by a divine light. On the forty-ninth day, from the divine light appears "an old monkey with fiery eyes and golden pupils, a pointed mouth and hollow cheeks, carrying in his hand the Compliant Golden-Hooped Rod." The old monkey is none other than his ancestor Sun Wukong, with his trademark weapon. Putting his mouth to the Little Stone Monkey's ear, the old Monkey King silently passes on to him many secret doctrines concerning immortality. Immediately enlightened and transformed into a divine being, the Lesser Sage wants to know more, but the old monkey approaches him and merges with him as one whole body. The Little Stone Monkey comes to the moment of great realization: "The true master is after all in one's own mind, but people don't know where to look for him" (p. 18). The Buddhist principle of Wulou *.A, (Anasrava in Sanskrit, meaning "no leak or flow") indicates the enlightened state of the human mind, when the leakage of passions is stopped and the stream of transmigratory suffering is ceased. Similarly a key word in Taoist alchemical terminology, wulou or loujin i4 (cessation of leaking) is applied to "the stoppage of all that normally 'leaks out' through the sense-organs and other parts of the body."27 The futile attempt by the Little Stone Monkey in his quest for immortality and the final revelation in the No-Leak Cave can be interpreted as a Taoist discovery of the truth that "Everyone has the immortality 26Henri Maspero, Taoism and Chinese Religion, p. 518. 27 See Joseph Needham, Science and Civilisation in China, pp. 252-3.</page><page sequence="13">LIU A Journey of the Mind 47 drug in himself," and only when he cultivates himself to annihilate all his desires can a Taoist adept "transcend (the state of) wulou to become a zhenren (true man or immortal).28 The same experience can also represent in symbolic terms the process of self- realization in the Chan Buddhist version of sudden enlightenment. Through the mouth of his protagonist, the author gives advice to those readers who fail to understand that true immortality (in Taoism) or Buddha nature (in Buddhism) can only be attained through self cultivation: I have been searching everywhere, but what I have found are all heretical sects and heterodox schools.... Instead of wandering around among mountains and rivers, I would rather go back home and work on my square-inch land (the mind). (p. 17) The message delivered through the episodes in the opening and the ensuing chapters of the Little Stone Monkey's journey echoes the Chan Buddhist theme in the opening poem that "The Buddha is the product of one's own nature. Do not seek it outside of your body."29 The novelist's Chan Buddhist concept of the Mind and self-cultiva- tion becomes obvious when we compare the outcome of the Little Stone Monkey's journey with that of his ancestor's quest for immortality. In The Journey to the West, Sun Wukong becomes a disciple of Patriarch Subodhi who imparts to him "the formula for enjoying the same age as Heaven, the secret of immortality" (I, p. 98). But in Hou Xiyou ji, the Little Stone Monkey follows the example of his ancestor in searching for a master, only to be disillusioned by his heretical practices. His final discovery of the True Master in himself reinforces the author's Chan Buddhist view that the Ultimate Truth or the Right Way is to be achieved through self-enlightenment, rather than through external aids or ritual practices. Once enlightened on the nature of his mind, the Little Stone Monkey continues his quest for immortality through his own efforts. After the practice of "calming the mind" and "nourishing breath," the next stage in Taoist internal alchemy is "Driving the Dragon and Harnessing the Tiger (qulong jiahu4,%,,/ )," a process of moving and manipulating breath or energy in the human body.30 Dragon and Tiger are the most popular and most frequently used symbols in Taoist alchemical texts and theories. The Dragon, usually referred to as qinglong -*I (the Green Dragon), and the Tiger, or baihu O( (the White Tiger), are generally used by the waidan (external elixir) school to refer to mercury and lead. In the neidan (inner elixir) school, the two symbolic animals are no longer tangible substances but are identified with the various parts of the human body. Very often the Dragon and the Tiger are called the "true" or "purified" lead and mercury, in distinction from the metals used as ingredients in exoteric alchemy. In Zhang Boduan's Wuzhen pian, there are many references to the Dragon and the Tiger. In one of his poems, he states: 28Zhang Boduan, Wuzhen pian, Vol. I, p. 11 &amp; Vol. III, p. 20. 29Wing-tsit Chan, The Platform Scripture, p. 95. 30In Taoist internal alchemy, terms like "dragon and tiger," "mercury and lead" and "water and fire" are all synonyms used to signify the "flow of energy (nengliang liu ' )" in the human body. See Zhou Shiyi )j -- and Pan Qiming ' , Zhouyi cantong qi xintan )j 4 ~,E~ (Changsha: Hunan Renmin, 1981), pp. 19-20.</page><page sequence="14">48 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 13 (1991) The White Tiger grows angry in the Western Mountain, And the Green Dragon is irresistibly fierce in the Eastern Sea. Capture them with both hands and let them fight to death. They then change into a layer of purple gold powder.31 Like many other dualistic pairs in Taoist alchemical terminology, the Tiger and the Dragon are synonyms, or variant symbols, of the primordial pair shen (spirit) and qi (breath). The poem is the description of neidan practice of nourishing the breath (yangqi) and completing the spirit (quanshen j-# ), in order to obtain "the powder of purple gold," i.e. gold elixir, the symbol of immortality. The Dragon-Tiger meta- phor is also used to refer to the human mind and to human desires, which like the angry tiger and the fierce dragon are constantly active, restless and difficult to control. Therefore, the expression "Subduing the Dragon and Taming the Tiger (xianglong fuhu *A k&amp;, ) becomes a metaphorical term frequently used in Taoist literature to describe the internal alchemical process of keeping one's desires under control and combining breath and spirit through respiratory exercise. After his experience in the No-Leak Cave, the Little Stone Monkey pulls from the rock the Golden-Hooped Rod left there by the Old Monkey King, which attests to his newly acquired power and identity as an immortal. He travels to the Eastern Sea and transforms his magic weapon into a fishing rod, with which he angles for baby dragons. The Old Dragon King comes to their rescue, but fails to overcome him with force. The Dragon King surrenders and treats the Little Stone Monkey to a banquet in the Crystal Palace. The Monkey then goes to the Western Mountain, where he kills seven or eight ferocious tigers before he spares the life of the Old Yellow Tiger, who succumbs to his power and agrees to guard the entrance at the Flower-Fruit Mountain. With our knowledge of Taoist alchemy, we know the story is not an innovative plot, but merely an allegorical illustration of the expression "Subduing the Dragon and Taming the Tiger." The Old Dragon King is from the Eastern Sea, because the liver-breath it represents is identified with the East, and the Old Tiger is found in the Western Mountain, because the lung-breath it represents is identified with the West. By conquering the Dragon of the Eastern Sea and the Tiger of the Western Mountain, the Little Stone Monkey succeeds in combining yin and yang to produce true breath (zhenqi ~Ai ) and thus completes another phase in his quest for immortality. His next step forward takes place in the realm of the dead. In Chinese mythology, the nether world, Youming jie * #-X (Region of Darkness), is ruled by the Ten Kings of the Underworld, who are in charge of the cyclic succession of life and death. When a person's term of life expires according to the Register of Births and Deaths, his soul is summoned to the Region of Darkness, where he is sentenced and punished for his wrong-doings, his evil deeds. After purgatory in the Ten Courts, he is then reincarnated into one of the six forms of existence (gods, men, demons living under- ground, animals, hungry ghosts, and beings undergoing torments in hell), according to his merits or demerits in his previous existence. Thus Death is identified with 31 Zhang Boduan, Wuzhen pian, Vol. II, p. 21. The English version is quoted from Tenney L. Davis &amp; Chao Yun-ts'ung, "Chang Po-tuan of T'ien-t'ai, His Wu Chen P'ien, Essay on the Understanding of the Truth," Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 73 (1939), 107.</page><page sequence="15">LIU A Journey of the Mind 49 the experience of going through the underworld judicial process of trial, punishment, purgatory and finally rebirth. In The Journey to the West (Chapter 3), the Monkey King goes to the Palace of Darkness, finds the Ledger on monkeys, and crosses out all the names he can find in it. As he fights his way out, he says to the terrorized Ten Kings of the Underworld: "That's the end of the account, the end of the account! Now I'm truly not your subject." Since he erases his own name from the register, the Monkey King is no longer under Yama's jurisdiction. He stops the Wheel of Transmigration for himself and thus becomes an immortal, affected by neither birth or death. Like the tour of Hell in the legends and myths of many other cultures, Sun Wukong's journey to the nether world symbolizes the process of rebirth and immortalization by conquering and eliminating death. In Hou Xiyou ji the Little Stone Monkey makes a similar trip to the Region of Darkness. As his adviser tells him, "If you, the Great King, wish to be a true and upright immortal, you have to understand birth and death, good and evil." To find answers to these questions, he goes to visit the Ten Kings of the Underworld. He argues with them about retributive justice and preordained punishment, and exposes the injustices and the contradictions in their verdicts that determine the fate of all human beings and animals. He thus attacks their traditional facade of being upright and incorruptible judges. The Ten Kings admit their negligence and acknow- ledge their errors, and praise the Little Stone Monkey for his discerning eyes and sound judgement. Unlike his ancestor who relied on brute force to obliterate his name from the Register of Births and Deaths and caused great confusion in the Palace of Darkness, Sun Liizhen wins the battle of wits over his opponents with brilliant reasoning. As he is leaving, the younger Monkey says to the Ten Kings: "According to what you have said, the decisions on birth and death have become your personal means to reward or punish.... If the justice of the Underworld is like this, there is no need to use the Record of Names (to determine one's life and death)" (p. 30). By debunking the authority and integrity of the rulers of the nether- world, the Monkey King proves his superiority as an immortal no longer subject to their sovereignty and impervious to their summons to death. Therefore his challenge to the Kings of the Underworld is symbolically his defiance of death and his transcen- dence of mortal existence in the Triple Worlds. Containing the episodes of conquering the Dragon King and the Tiger and the debate with the Ten Kings of the Underworld, Chapter 3 is entitled "Subduing the Dragon and the Tiger by Force/ Vanquishing Devils and Spirits with the Power of Tao," which is adapted from a famous couplet by Zhang Boduan: The Tiger and the Dragon will surrender to the highly learned Tao; Devils and spirits can be made to venerate you because of your glorious virtue. 32 The couplet is from one of Zhang's alchemical poems in his Wuzhen pian. In the poem he employs the conventional Taoist metaphor of "Subduing the Dragon and the Tiger" to explain the process of exercising physiological techniques. If one can subdue the Dragon and the Tiger within himself, one is bound to win respect and reverence from devils and spirits, who can no longer control one's life. This poem and other expositions of Taoist spiritual alchemy provide the author of Hou Xiyou ji 32Ibid., p. 105.</page><page sequence="16">50 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 13 (1991) with the prototypical and primary metaphor upon which the plot of the episode is based. The couplet is quoted as a summary at the end of the chapter, to reinforce the theme of the episode, whose meaning and implications would be now obvious to anyone familiar with the Dragon-Tiger allusion in Taoist alchemy. When one attains immortality through the transmutation processes, he no longer fears evil ghosts in the world or the Yama King of the Underworld. But the ultimate goal of an aspirant to eternal life is to become "a guest of the Divine Heaven (lingxiao zhike ~4 )," a supernatural celestial being who has transformed his body into a weightless, cloud-like substance of pure spirit, and is thus capable of travelling freely between different realms of the universe. As the Bare-Armed Monkey tells the Little Stone Monkey upon his return from the Underworld: "The Kings of Ghosts after all belong to the lower region. I heard that truth is to be sought in the ultimate height. If you want to know the complete course of Creation, you must go to the Imperial Heaven." (p. 32) Entitled "Myriad Thoughts Breed Disorder/ Original Nature Calms the Mind," Chapter 4, the last chapter of the miniature journey episode, describes the final stage of the younger Monkey King's quest for immortality: his trip to the Upper Region, his rebellion in the Heavenly Palace and his defeat by Sun Wukong. The plot of this episode is very closely based on the earlier Journey to the West. Following the footsteps of his ancestor, the Little Stone Monkey sneaks through the South Heavenly Gate, goes to visit the Imperial Stables and then to the official residence of the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven, which was built for Sun Wukong and has by now been reduced to ruins. Unable to find any fruit in the Garden of Immortal Peaches, the Lesser Sage heads for the Jasper Pool (Yaochi 3~I ) to ask the Mother Queen (Wang Mu I-4 ) for divine food and wine. When he gets drunk and creates a disturbance, the Jade Emperor orders celestial soldiers to seize him. After failing to defeat him with force, the Emperor sends for Sun Wukong: Sun finally brings him under control with enlightening advice. One of the major events of the Little Stone Monkey's heavenly adventure in Hou Xiyou ji is his visit to the Jasper Pool, where resides the Mother Queen, one of the most important and powerful figures in the Taoist pantheon. With the posses- sion of immortal peaches and other drugs of longevity, the Mother Queen is the symbol of immortality, and the Jasper Pool where she lives is regarded as the paradise of divine beings, the residence of immortals, and the final destination of all Taoist aspirants. In a Taoist pamphlet entitled Lii Zu Zhixuan pian mizhu g L X (Secret Annotations on the Poems to Illuminate Mystery by Patriarch Lii), the annotator Canghai Laoren *~ A_ describes with imagination and conviction what happens upon the completion of one's cultivation: He sheds his mortal body and rises up on the crane of clouds. He reaches the Ninth Heaven and enters the Purple Gate to have an audience with the Jade Emperor and the deities of various heavens. Rewarded according to his merits, he receives immortal clothes and ribbons. Then he travels to the Jasper Pool to pay homage to the Sacred Mother who awards him a banquet of immortal peaches.33 The description is characteristic of the general Taoist belief that if an adept is successful in his efforts to obtain the elixir, either by the external or internal method, 33Xiao Tianshi, ed., Taiyi jinhua zongzhi Lii Zu Zhixuan pian mizhu hekan, pp. 168-9.</page><page sequence="17">LIU A Journey of the Mind 51 he will fly upward to the abode of the Jade Emperor and enjoy his immortality with other divine beings. We can clearly see the pattern in the Little Stone Monkey's heavenly journey, which signifies his attainment of immortality. Though the details of the events and the characterization are the result of the author's creative imagina- tion, the main structure of the plot is based on the Taoist concept of achieving the status of an immortal and becoming "a guest of Divine Heaven." The mythical world of immortals portrayed in Taoist literature is perceived by believers as a realm of actual existence which is only accessible to divine and super- natural beings. However, this fairyland, these celestial places have different functions and meanings in Taoist physiology. According to the Taoist microcosmic view, the human body is an entity with features corresponding to the cosmic universe. Therefore the heavenly places with hierarchies of gods and goddesses also exist in one's body and are used as terms in Taoist physiological alchemy to refer to various parts and organs of human anatomy. For example, the Celestial Palace (tiangong Ag ) and the Jasper Pool are not only the heavenly residences of the Jade Emperor and the Mother Queen, but also anatomical terminology for the top regions of the head. The microcosmic counterparts of the celestial places are located on the physiological routes where breath or fluids from the five viscera circulate up to reach the brain in the regenerative process of recycled elixir (huandan tA- ), which is also referred to as wuqi chaoyuan -i %A i# t (Five breaths revert to the origin), or sanyang juding El TA (Three yang breaths gather at the top of the head). The practice and theory of Taoist internal alchemy are primarily concerned with the attempt to bring one's own body back to its original state of perfect purity and vitality. The underlying principle of the various methods and techniques to achieve this goal is fairly well summed up in the epigram "One who follows [Nature] is ordinary; one who reverses it is immortal" (shunzhe fan, nizhe xian )A# ~ i, ji;#i ). Taoist physiological alchemists believe that the ageing process can be reversed by making one's breath and semen return and go upward to nourish the brain through meditative and respiratory exercises. In the formation of elixir, yang (true) breaths are cultivated to transmute the breaths from the five viscera into spirits (lianqi chengshen LA # ). As the yang breaths ascend to the primary state, "the Heart(Mind)-Spirit returns to the Celestial Palace (xinshen fanyu tiangong , 't Xf- )."34 It is probably not a coincidence that Sun Wukong is also referred to as Xinshen i" #\ (Heart/Mind- Spirit; See Note 13) and the monkey hero in both novels is identified as xinyuan Jr I (Monkey of the Heart/Mind), whose journey to Heaven corresponds to the pattern of recycled elixir. In the sequel Hou Xiyou ji, the skyward journey of the Little Stone Monkey to the Jasper Pool and later on the Celestial Palace becomes the symbolic representation of the reversal of natural ageing by transforming the breaths and sending the spirit of the heart to the uppermost parts of the body to generate there an elixir for eternal life. Sun Wukong's disturbance in Heaven is one of the most famous and exciting episodes in The Journey to the West. The story of the Monkey King's havoc in the Celestial Palace has established his image as a rebellious and courageous hero who 34Zhongli Quan and Lii Dongbin, Zhong Lii chuandao ji, p. 151. For further references to Taoist concept of cosmological realms in the human body and anatomy, see Edward H. Schafer, Mirages in the Sea of Time: The Taoist Poetry of Ts'ao T'ang (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1985).</page><page sequence="18">52 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 13 (1991) challenges supreme authority, as represented by the Jade Emperor. In the sequel Hou Xiyou ji the Little Stone Monkey is portrayed as a similar defiant and dauntless rebel who shows no respect for heavenly laws and for authority, and the basic pattern of his adventure in heaven follows closely the original story, except for a more positive outcome for the rebel. The prototype of the Monkey's disturbance of the Celestial Palace is found in some early dramatic versions of the popular Xiyou ji cycle. The basic plot involves a demonic deity (moshen &amp;# ), the archetype of Sun Wukong, who steals golden pills and immortal peaches from celestial banquets and is punished for "violating heavenly rules (fan tiantiao aE A ).",,35 Though the origins of this tale are still unknown, I conclude they are related to Taoist conceptions of physio- logical alchemy. The following passage from Taiyi jinhua zongzhi might shed light on the subject: When men are set free from the womb, the primal spirit dwells in the square inch (between the eyes), but the conscious spirit dwells below in the heart.... The lower heart moves like a strong, powerful commander who despises the heavenly ruler because of his weakness, and has usurped the leadership in affairs of state. But when the primal castle can be fortified and defended, then it is as if a strong and wise ruler sat upon the throne. The eyes start the light circulating like two ministers at the right and left who support the ruler with all their might. When rule in the center is thus in order, all those rebellious heroes will present themselves with lances reversed ready to take orders.35 According to the scripture, the primary spirit (yuanshen 5f* ), is the essence of the universe "whence heaven and earth derive their being." While the primary spirit is the heavenly heart (tianxin R, ) in the head, the conscious spirit (shishen - ) is the heart of flesh and blood (xuerou xin *i t i, ) in the abdomen. While the former is without consciousness and knowledge, the latter is dependent on the outside world and constrained by feelings and desires. The primary spirit is the ruler who regulates the formative processes of the body, but his authority can be threatened if the conscious spirit becomes strong and powerful. If one wants to maintain the dominant position of the primary spirit, which is identified with the true human nature, one must subjugate the conscious spirit by relieving it of sensuous desires and emotions. By comparing this Taoist concept of physiological alchemy with the adventures of the Monkey, we can clearly see the connection between the two: the Jade Emperor is the primary spirit, the heavenly ruler, and the Monkey (who is constantly referred to as xinyuan) is identified with the conscious spirit or the heart of blood and flesh, the rebellious general who attempts to usurp the imperial throne. In The Journey to the West Sun Wukong proclaims himself "The Great Sage, Equal to Heaven," and wants to seize the throne of the Jade Emperor. As he says to Tathagata: "The proverb says, 'Many are the turns of kingship, and next year the turn will be mine!' Tell him (the Jade Emperor) to move out at once and hand over the Celestial Palace 35 See Er Lang shen suo Qitian dasheng zaju ~- 5 A # * 0 _ * # , by an anonymous author, and Yang Jingxian # f-*, Xiyou ji zaju f - k ~j in Zhu Yixuan .-- &amp; Liu Yuchen #1 A t, ed., Xiyou ji ziliao huibian f* e* W~-J.

(Vol. I, p. 172). The author also reveals to the reader the profound truth that "A monkey's transformed body weds the human mind. / Mind is a monkey," and that Sun Wukong suffers pains and perils because his proud heart "has sought to scale the limits, / Confounding the world's order and perverting the law." (Vol. I, pp. 168, 166) In Hou Xiyou ji, the Little Stone Monkey follows the example of his ancestor and calls himself "The Lesser Sage, Equal to Heaven," showing no respect for the heavenly authority represented by the Mother Queen and the Jade Emperor. Identified with the conscious spirit, the Little Stone Monkey is an arrogant and impulsive being whose actions are totally dictated by his desires and emotions. His disturbance of the Celestial Palace symbolizes the weakened and confused state of the human body when the heavenly heart (the primary spirit) is threatened and overpowered by the lower heart (the conscious spirit) of flesh and blood. When he fails to defeat the Little Stone Monkey with his celestial army, the Jade Emperor sends for Sun Wukong to calm his "wild heart." The Great Sage then goes to the Flower-Fruit Mountain to persuade his unruly and rebellious descendant to return to the right Way. After being enlightened by the admonition of his ancestor, the Lesser Sage "suddenly lost all his wild desires, and his evil thoughts also disap- peared." When the Little Stone Monkey first learned of his ancestor, he wanted very much to meet him. As the Bare-Armed Monkey told him, his wish indicates a desire to "return to the original and primary state (fanben huanyuan 1AI*ifI )." Thus the submission of the Little Stone Monkey represents the subjugation of the conscious spirit and the return of human nature to its original state where the primary spirit is the ruler and the mind is free from any emotion or desire. Before his departure, Sun Wukong gives the Little Stone Monkey some instruc- tions in the form of a Buddhist verse: There is a limit to brute force, But wisdom and courage are boundless; If you fail to achieve the right fruition, You will forever be a wild immortal. (p. 43) In the poem Sun Wukong tells his descendant to resort to wisdom and courage, rather than brute force, to achieve his goal. This teaching is borne out by the fact that it is not the celestial army but Sun Wukong who subdues the Little Stone Monkey with his enlightening words. But more important is the message conveyed in the last two lines. Though the Little Stone Monkey had obtained physical immor- tality, he was still a yexian -fjb (wild immortal), because he could not quench his desires and emotions. Ye f not only means "untamed" or "uncultivated", but also "unorthodox". According to Chan Buddhist doctrine of wunian (absence-of- thought), man's original nature is pure and free from all thoughts and passions. In the first section of the novel, the Little Stone Monkey tries a Taoist approach in his effort to seek immortality. Though he succeeds through Taoist meditation in calming his mind and in realizing his self-nature, his desire for immortality and his practice of internal alchemy, symbolized by his celestial adventures, violate the Chan Buddhist principle of non-attachment, and are therefore considered "wild" and "unorthodox" by Buddhist ontological non-dualism. The completion of the Taoist physiological alchemy is only the beginning of a self-cultivation process for the hero whose ultimate goal, as well as that of his fellow pilgrims, is to accomplish</page><page sequence="20">54 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 13 (1991) zhengguo JiE_ (right or orthodox fruition), i.e. to achieve the Buddhahood inherent in one's own nature, through the journey proper to the Holy Mountain in the Western Paradise. The first four chapters of the sequel Hou Xiyou ji constitute a mini-journey for the protagonist Sun Liizhen: his adventures are in fact an allegorical version of Taoist internal alchemy. The key to the interpretation of these fantastic stories is provided by the author at the beginning of the novel. There a poetic riddle points out the existence of two levels of reality: the physical world represented by the Buddha statue made of mud and paint, and the spiritual world represented by the Buddha within ourselves. While the former is easily recognized, the latter is often ignored or neglected. The contrast and comparison between the two realities are the constant themes of the novel. In the early episodes, the Little Stone Monkey searches diligently for the way to immortality, only to find the true master in his own heart. When Sun Wukong is summoned to subdue the Little Stone Monkey, he confiscates his iron rod. Afterwards the Lesser Sage begs his ancestor to return his weapon, so he can protect himself. Sun Wukong laughs: "It is already in your ear (where you used to hide the reduced weapon). How can I give it back to you?" Like people who fail to recognize the Buddha within themselves, the Little Stone Monkey does not realize that the true weapon resides not in the external, but in the internal or spiritual world. Through such examples, the author guides and encourages the reader to go beyond physical reality (the literal level of the novel) in search of the spiritual reality (the allegorical level of religious truth and signifi- cance). The pilgrimage or the journey as quest is one of the fundamental and recurrent narrative forms of symbolic action in allegory. The motif of a pilgrim or a group of pilgrims travelling to a sacred or revered place for religious purposes has tradi- tionally been used in Western allegorical literatures to depict the process and progress of man's spiritual growth and his discovery of truth about himself and his world. As Gay Clifford points out: To express change and process allegorical action often takes the form of a journey, a quest, or a pursuit: this becomes the metaphor by which a process of learning for both protagonists and reader is expressed. In the course of their adventures the heroes of allegory discover which ideals are worth pursuing and what things are obstacles to that pursuit. The narrative action thus gradually establishes a hierarchy of value and dis-value.37 The image of a pilgrim embarking on a journey to a successful goal thus provides the most appropriate means for an author to depict the human experience of spiritual transformation and enlightenment. The plot of an allegorical journey may vary in terms of pilgrims' religious background, their destinations and their objectives, but the fictional content necessarily operates on two levels: the literal dimension of the protagonists' movements and actions, and the symbolic or figurative aspect revealed through their physical progress. The tale of the Little Stone Monkey's quest for immortality in the first section of the sequel Hou Xiyou ji provides a perfect example of the allegorical scheme 37Gay Clifford, The Transformations of Allegory (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1974), p. 11.</page><page sequence="21">LIU A Journey of the Mind 55 employed by the author throughout the novel, and of the double process of learning for both the protagonists and the reader. In the course of his adventures and encounters, which represent the process of Taoist physiological alchemy, the hero, as well as the reader, discovers the value and nature of his own mind, where enlighten- ment is achieved and the solutions to his problems are to be found. If the quest of the Little Stone Monkey is understood as the internal process of self-realization and self-cultivation, the main journey of the novel, which is undertaken by the pilgrims of Monk Da Dian k-V and his three disciples to acquire the true inter- pretation of the scriptures, can also reveal its meaning as the constant human pursuit of spiritual truth and religious salvation.</page></plain_text>
