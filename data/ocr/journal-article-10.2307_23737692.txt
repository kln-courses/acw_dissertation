<plain_text><page sequence="1">TENNYSON'S "THE LADY OF SHALOTT": THE AMBIGUITY OF COMMITMENT James L. Hill Tennyson's "The Lady of Shalott" is the earliest, and in many ways the clearest, Victorian example of the dramatiza tion of the pathetic struggle between thought and feeling— the mind's rational ordering of experience into patterns, and the disruption of those patterns by emotional response which refuses to be controlled. The interplay between the rational and the irrational, between "head" and "heart," establishes the poem both in its relation to one of the most pervasive themes of Victorian literature, and as pointing directly to Tennyson's Romantic antecedents. The ambiguities and ironies of the poem, and the structure which brings them to life, invite comparison with the poetry of Shelley, Keats and Coleridge. Moreover, if we make the effort to read "The Lady of Shalott" with the closeness we give to Romantic poetry, two additional points become clear; first, that the kind of generalized statement usually made about the poem, to the effect that it is a homily on what happens to the artist who isolates himself from society, simply fails to account for it satisfactorily, and second, that Tennyson's craftsmanship, for which he is justly praised, does more than give a high sheen to Victorian platitudes. In his Tennyson Handbook, George O. Marshall exempli fies this emphasis on Tennyson as craftsman in his remarks on the revision of "The Lady of Shalott": The improvement of the 1842 text over the 1833 version shows how an artist can redeem a poem marred by unnatural and 415</page><page sequence="2">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW awkward phrases. A study of the two versions is a lesson in re vision, as is a study of the text of many poems which appeared in both the 1833 and 1842 volumes. These comments on the meaning of the poem are also typical of all but a few of the recent studies of Tennyson. Marshall continues: But it is not necessary to determine the exact allegorical sig nificance in order to appreciate the poem. Here is a master piece. ... A modern scholar calls the 1842 version "as near perfect as the work of mortals ever gets to be, in structure, in details, and in the evocation of sight, sound, and feeling." But "The Lady of Shalott" is much more than a vaguely allegorical poem. If Tennyson's allegory cannot be deter mined with any degree of precision, we cannot say that the poem approaches anything like perfection of structure and detail, for the purpose of structure is to allow us to see as clearly as possible the poet's meaning, and detail is significant only as it helps to elucidate that meaning. Besides, the poem is not allegorical in either the nineteenth-century or the tra ditional sense. It is a symbolic structure, as Tennyson inher ited this structure from Coleridge, Keats and Shelley, and when we approach it in this light it proves to be as rich in its own way as "Christabel," "The Eve of Saint Agnes" or "Alastor." The basic problem posed by the poem is implicit in Ten nyson's own explanation of its significance: The new-born love for something, for someone in the wide world from which she has been so long secluded, takes her out of the region of shadows into that of realities.1 iHallam Tennyson, Alfred Lord Tennyson; A Memoir by his Son (New York, 1897), I, p. 117. R. C. Tobias, in "The Year's Work in Victorian Poetry: 1964, Victorian Poetry, III (1965), pp. 126-127, disagrees with Lona Mosk Packer's assertion ("Sun and Shadow: The Nature of Experience in Tenny son's 'The Lady of Shalott,'" VN, no. 25, pp. 4-8) that Tennyson's statement may be used as a basis for interpreting the poem, since the statement was intended to provide an explanation for the poem for a book on Tennyson for younger readers. But at no time in his life was Tennyson given to com plex explanations of his poems or the works of others; no such comments find their way into his biographies, and whatever remarks have come down to us tend to be as generalized as this one, whether addressed to children or 4 i 6</page><page sequence="3">THE LADY OF SHALOTT We are told that the Lady is isolated from reality, but that she is drawn out of her isolation by love for someone or something outside herself. The movement is from with drawal, epitomized in her artistic preoccupation, to a full commitment to life or reality. But what Tennyson leaves out in his statement is as important as what he tells us. The com mitment which the Lady makes, her acquiescence to the need for human relationships, brings down a curse upon her and she dies. Release of self leads to destruction. Thus the poem presents a paradox in which the sterility of contemplative withdrawal is placed alongside the process of life and death, so that the poem already passes far beyond any praise of its "empty" structure. "The Lady of Shalott" is an imaginative "figuring forth" of this paradox, and presents paradigmati cally what is perhaps the major theme of Tennyson's poetry. II As a literary medieval ballad, "The Lady of Shalott" exploits the incantatory possibilities of the ballad measure along lines established in "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" and "La Belle Dame Sans Merci." And Tennyson, like his predeces sors, has the virtuosity to overcome the difficulties of con tinuous rhyme with apparently effortless facility. But, again like Keats and Coleridge, he uses rhyme repetition for pur poses beyond mere decoration. Rhyme serves as a means by which the poet attempts to hypnotize the reader and to lead him unresisting into the imaginary world of the poem. It also serves to emphasize the progression of images, drawing our attention to particular details in such a way that we become aware of their concrete reality. Stanza one of the first section of the poem exhibits Tenny son's manipulation of our attention through rhyme perfectly: adults. And while Tennyson's statement is admittedly simplified, this does not mean that it points us away from the central meaning of the poem. Thus, while it may not provide us with an adequate basis for interpretation, it at least gives us a hint—and a good one—that is worth following up. 417</page><page sequence="4">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW On either side the river lie Long fields of barley and of rye, That clothe the wold and meet the sky; And thro' the field a road runs by To many-tower'd Camelot. And up and down the people go, Gazing where the lilies blow, Round an island there below, The island of Shalott. The quatrain uses its first three verses to create a completely framed landscape. In the fourth verse, Tennyson suddenly draws our attention to the road going up to Camelot, pulling us from a focus on the landscape as a framed whole into the picture itself, the road acting as a perspective line to lead the eye inward to the distant single point of Camelot. Without introducing a single human figure, Tennyson ani mates his description of this landscape by a careful arrange ment of verbs. The verbal progression, "lie," "clothe," "meet" and "runs," moves from passive to active, each verb releasing more energy until "runs," so that this verb, express ing movement, marking a shift from plural to singular, and from general to particular objects, energizes the whole land scape into life and points its vitality toward Camelot. Con tinuous repetition of rhyme acts further to energize the scene through a buildup of sound which serves to create an aware ness of, and a need for, immanent resolution. The final shift from the single-rhyme quatrain to the new rhyme "Camelot" effects what amounts almost to a transformation of latent to kinetic energy, which is released to subside into the refrain. Thus the progression of rhymes is analogous to the verbal and imagistic progressions, all three concentrating heavily on the final image of the distant city. Tennyson succeeds in a very short space in creating a vital and dynamic landscape in which his legend is to take place, and in drawing his reader into the "reality" of that landscape by the use of rhyme and image. These initial verses also establish the basic symbolic pat tern of the poem. The two major interests in the poem are 4 1 8</page><page sequence="5">THE LADY OF SHALOTT to be Camelot and the road leading to it, and the island of Shalott and its surrounding river. As we shall see, Camelot and the road represent ordinary vitality, or the bustle and energy of life as it is usually lived. Shalott, however, repre sents withdrawal; the objective perception of life, but a lack of participation in its processes. These two opposed symbols express two kinds of energy, the energy of normal, unthink ing but vigorous life, and the energy of intense, if objective, contemplation—or, to put it another way, the active life, and the life of the mind or the imagination. Both kinds of energy are suggested immediately in the initial stanza. The river appears in the first stanza, and while it receives no verb, the objects closest to it, the fields, receive the verbs of least activity: "lie," "clothe" and "meet." At the end of the first four verses Camelot is introduced, and though it too receives no verb, the road leading to it receives the strongest verb in the first five verses, "runs." The second half of the stanza, a tercet followed by the final refrain, further develops this suggestion of antagonistic energies. Tennyson merely reverses the energic direction from movement to cessation, ending with a focus on the island. This is the general pattern of movement in the stanzas forming the first section of the poem. The imagery, as we should expect from the refrain arrangement of "Camelot—Shalott," develops through active images in the first four verses of the stanzas, which deal with the outside world, and through passive or mysterious images in the Shalott tercets. In the second section of the poem this pattern begins to change. After we have learned of the Lady's weaving, Tenny son introduces images which her mirror reflects within her tower. These reflections are ostensibly "shadows" of the outer world, and as such they are appropriately introduced in the first four verses of stanza two. But these images intrude upon the tower room itself, and begin to occupy a more and more prominent place in the last half of the stanzas. Again Tennyson uses the device of focusing, narrowing from the general to the particular in order to give a quickened sense 419</page><page sequence="6">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW of vitality to these reflected objects. In stanza two we move from "surley village churls" to "the red cloaks of market girls," with an emphasis on the spots of color. In the third stanza there is a double narrowing of focus, first from the "troop of damsels glad" to the single "abbot on an ambling pad," then from a "curly shepherd-lad" to the "long-hair'd page in crimson clad," again with a final spotlight on the color red. These two points of color also show a shift from feminine to masculine, from "damsels" to "page," that will be developed further in the poem. Thus in this stanza images shift from groups to individuals, and from female to male. The two final stanzas of section two are both predominantly sensual images, the male knights riding by and the young lovers. Coupled with the image of the lovers is a funeral pageant, a first hint of the relationship of death and active life that will become the dominant theme of the poem. In the third section, the shattering force of active intru sion, represented by masculine force, into the contemplative life of the Lady becomes complete. This section is given entirely to an individual knight, Lancelot, and Tennyson again uses continually finer and finer delineation of detail to achieve intensity and to create a sense of quintessential vi tality. In the first four verses of the first stanza, the verb pro gression of stanza one, section one, is repeated, but this time the verbs are charged with connotations, particularly through their suggestion of color, which they did not carry so fully in section one: A bow-shot from her bower-eves, He rode between the barley sheaves, The sun came dazzling thro' the leaves, And flamed upon the brazen greaves, Of bold Sir Lancelot. In this stanza, "Lancelot" replaces "Camelot" in the only variant of the refrain pattern, evidently now either taking the place of, or standing for, the city. The verbal progression, "rode," "came dazzling" and "flamed," not only gains in kinetic energy, but also takes on potential energy through 420</page><page sequence="7">THE LADY OF SHALOTT the increasing brilliance of light with which the verbs are associated. The adjectives in these verses, "brazen" and "bold," add to this suggestion of potential force, and the noun, "a bow-shot," by which Tennyson indicates the dis tance of Lancelot from Shalott, both suggests the fatal way in which his image in the mirror will affect the Lady, and is itself irrefragably masculine, the method of measuring the distance suggesting the vulnerability of the Lady. This description of Lancelot establishes one of the central ironies of the poem. While the physical description of Lance lot places a heavy, almost overwhelming emphasis on him as a figure of masculine aggressiveness, power and beauty, Ten nyson makes it clear that Lancelot's actions in the poem are completely devoid of the intentions which his appearance suggests. He is a "loyal knight and true," just as the knights of section two, and this is made perfectly clear by the emblem of devotion on his shield. It is the fact of Lancelot—his mere presence—rather than any deliberate action on his part, which is to destroy the Lady of Shalott. After the initial description of Lancelot in stanza one, Tennyson describes different parts of his armor and trap pings, suggesting at the same time an emotional reaction within the Lady watching him that becomes steadily more exhilarated and intoxicated. The comparisons are of sudden and dizzying expansion, reflecting in their turn the expansion of sensibility to which the Lady is being subjected. The bridle "glitter[ing] free" immediately conjures up the simile of the stars glittering in a "golden Galaxy." The flame of the helmet and feather suggests tremendous heat and color, and expands into the simile of the "bearded Meteor," a cos mic and masculine flame. The meteor moves over "still Shalott," emphasizing the active-passive dichotomy, "trailing light," or expending limitless energy for some incomprehen sible purpose. The final focus upon Lancelot is directed to his "coal-black curls," recalling the "curly shepherd-lad" and "long-hair'd page" of section two, but here brought to full maturity by the intensity of the "coal-black" and the meta 42 1</page><page sequence="8">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW morphosis of the crimson of the page's cloak to the "burning flame" of Lancelot's helmet and feather. So far in this section, Lancelot has performed no conscious act that calls attention to himself. His image, as the Lady sees it "flash . . . into the crystal mirror," has been either visual or auditory, from the noise of his armor and the bells on his bridle. But now he bursts into song, and it is this which drives the Lady to leave her loom and go to the window. His song in itself is senseless—merely an outpouring of well-being, an expression of happy health and dynamism. All that the Lady hears is a "tirra lirra" refrain, or a lyric outburst, but that is enough—or rather, too much. Tenny son again employs focus to suggest the full significance of her act of self-destruction, but this time the focus expands rather than narrows: She left the web, she left the loom; She made three paces thro' the room, She saw the water-lily bloom, She saw the helmet and the plume, She look'd down on Camelot. Here, repetition enforces the dramatic action of the Lady. "She" in each verse is immediately followed by the verb: "left," "made . . . paces," "saw," "saw" and "look'd." The Lady's actions become paramount, and the repetitions drive us, through suspense, to the final "look'd"; the Lady is seeing reality for the first time. Her eye travels from the water-lilies surrounding her island to the field where she sees Lancelot's helmet and feather, and finally to Camelot, the point of intense life at the end of the road he is traveling. Through the magic of Lancelot's song she is moved from a vision of the world to its reality, from the reflected images in her mir ror to the actuality of the landscape, and to the exuberant vitality of Camelot itself. In the last section of the poem, the progression from in ternal to external focus is complete. In the first section the movement of the second half of the stanzas is inward to Shalott. In section two, shadows are shown intruding into 422</page><page sequence="9">THE LADY OF SHALOTT the inner world of the Lady's tower. In the third section, the vision of Lancelot and the sound of his song shatter her seclusion. Finally, in the last section, the Lady herself moves outward from Shalott, and she follows both Lancelot and the funeral train to Camelot. Tennyson's manipulation of natural images is quite dif ferent in the last section of the poem from that of the three previous sections. As I attempted to show at the beginning of this analysis, Tennyson's initial treatment of landscape is designed to give a sense of reality to the poem, to draw the reader into the poem and thus make him susceptible to its "magic." Though the initial landscape was vitalized by a subtle arrangement of verbs, it was not imbued with per sonality; its vitality represented the vitality of life, or activity, in general. But in the last section of the poem, landscape changes from the objective and general to the subjective and specific. It is no longer something that appears as shadows in the Lady's mirror, but it becomes rather the mirror of her own shattered sensibility, and what it gains in symbolic intensity it loses in objective reality. The Lady is no longer contemplative or objective; somehow the overwhelming pres ence of Lancelot has destroyed what we might call her sense of self. She has become submerged in the irrationality of vitalism, or the life-course, which has its natural but incom prehensible end in death. And through this loss of a sense of individuality, or of rational control, she has slipped into a state of "trance," almost of unconsciousness. In Nietzsche's terms, the Dionysian, the irrational, has confronted the Apol lonian, the rational, and in this instance has destroyed it. This defeat of objectivity is reflected in the change that occurs in the landscape. In the first section of the poem it was perceived as vital but ordered, and both the Lady's isle and the landscape around Camelot were measured out and bound with finite, balanced, lines: On either side the river lie Long fields of barley and of rye, That clothe the wold and meet the sky; (italics mine) 423</page><page sequence="10">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW This landscape is Apollonian, existing within set measures, and forming a complete and rational (or at least, if not exactly rational, ordinary) natural structure within which the poem begins. There is a sense of fixed order, almost as if the poet is looking down on a toy world, where people move "up and down," and life, for all its energy, progresses evenly and uneventfully. Such is the world as it appears to the Lady in her "mirror clear," and the clarity of the mirror serves to rationalize and objectify her perception of this world. But this world is "shadow"; its order is a form of illusion, and the Apollonian control exerted by the mirror finally is not sufficient to hide the reality beneath it. Sensuous perception at last breaks through the artificial and illusion istic mirror; the mirror symbolizes the rational mind, and its delicate balance, sustained only by objectivity, is broken by forces over which it can exert no real control. The nature of the Lady's perceptions, her first direct, sensuous communica tion with the outside world, is not a shift from an ideal to a real world, but from surface reality to the vital chaos beneath it; the communication cannot be analyzed, but can only be perceived. For it is a necessary condition of such communica tion that it will not submit to rational procedures; its essence is complete irrationality, it is not structure but force, and force cannot be suspended for examination or it ceases to be force. The transformation of imagery in the last section of the poem creates a landscape that is intuitive rather than intel lectual, subjective rather than objective. We can understand more clearly Tennyson's transformation of the "Shalott" landscape if we place beside it an early suppressed poem, e / M Oi Qsoy-res : All thought, all creeds, all dreams are true All visions wild and strange; Man is the measure of all truth Unto himself. All truth is change: All men do walk in sleep, and all Have faith in what they dream: 424</page><page sequence="11">THE LADY OF SHALOTT For all things are as they seem to all, And all things flow like a stream. There is no rest, no calm, no pause, Nor good or ill, nor light or shade, Nor essence nor eternal laws; For nothing is, but all is made. But if I dream that all these are, They are to me for what I dream, For all things are as they seem to all, And all things flow like a stream. This poem poses a reality completely subjective, shaped by the individual. Each shaped reality has equal validity in that it is subjectively perceived, rather than rationally deduced. The essence of such perception is that it is process, that the dream is a continuous flow of energy, and that the truth of the dream is embodied in the change which process dictates. But the first landscape of "Shalott," real as it seems, is fixed. As a fixed image it is illusion, the objective illusion caused by the mind's arresting and systematizing the objects of its perception, thus denying their basic relationship to energy and process, their conditions for existence in a world of time and space. The landscape of the fourth section of the poem is the same landscape as that of the first, but it has been replaced in a subjective context. It is no longer system, but energy; its being is replaced by becoming, and its reality is the subjective reality of personal vision, as distinguished from objective illusion—now "all things are as they seem to all." The final landscape reflects the possibilities for nonrational action that were carefully developed in the picture of Lance lot. On one level, then, this new landscape represents forces latent beneath the order which the rational mind attempts to impose on its sense perceptions. On another level, it is a scenic correlative of the Lady's own agony, as she is weighed down by her Dionysian trance. The qualifying words in the first four verses of the first stanza express her agony, and the tremendous pressure, caused by her loss of rational control 425</page><page sequence="12">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW and her subsequent submersion in the processes of life, to which she is being subjected: In the stormy east-wind straining, The pale yellow woods were waning, The broad stream in his banks complaining, Heavily the low sky raining (italics mine) Nature, ceasing to operate on logical principles, has be come anthropomorphic, in the sense that its activities have become psychological rather than rational. The breakdown of rational boundaries is vivified in Tennyson's single per sonification, "The broad stream in his banks complaining." In submitting to the world of process, the Lady does not cease to be an artist; rather her art itself is transformed. The art of the first two sections of the poem was her tapestry, the mimetic expression of her knowledge of reality as it appeared in her mirror. But the art of the final section is song, a shift from spatial to temporal expression, a vision of reality newly perceived as process, where meaning results from evolving, rather than fixed, relationships. Ill As the change from objective to subjective landscape was prepared for by the description of Lancelot in section three, so the change in art forms from pictorial to auditory is pre pared for by the appearance of music and song earlier in the poem. Three songs, as well as the music of the funeral proces sion, occur in "The Lady of Shalott," and each of them func tions with a different significance. The first song is the Lady's, singing while she weaves: Only reapers, reaping early, In among the bearded barley, Hear a song that echoes cheerly, From the river winding clearly, Down to tower'd Camelot. And by the moon the reaper weary Piling sheaves in uplands airy, Listening, whispers, " 'Tis the fairy Land of Shalott.'" 426</page><page sequence="13">THE LADY OF SHALOTT Her song is heard only by the reaper, he hears it only in the very early morning and even then it is so faint that he can whisper his response to it. The song is carried as an echo by the river down to Camelot, and it thus parallels the song the Lady will sing as she floats down the river to Camelot to death. The Lady's first song is a fairy song; coming from an objective or isolated world, it acts upon the sensibility of the reaper, but there is no hint that it has any meaning for him other than its mysteriousness. The communication is purely sensuous and has no cognitive value. The second song, sung by Lancelot, is a meaningless "tirra lirra," which causes the Lady to fulfil the curse. It is the only time that human sound penetrates her chamber, and like her song in section one, it is happy. The difference between the two is that the Lady's song is disembodied, while Lancelot's song, in its wordless exuberance, is a fullbodied expression of earthly energy. While Lancelot's song, like the Lady's, is devoid of rational content, it is subjectively expressive. The Lady's song is meaningless because of its abstractness; Lance lot's is meaningful because of its expression of energy and vitality. It is the song of Dionysus, and although its meaning cannot be shaped into system, it nevertheless represents reality for that very reason; reality is the chaos of subjective sensation, its only meaning is change, and it denies the illu sion of objectivity the Lady's mirror creates. Reality is not externalized system, but internal chaos, and it is into such a reality that the Lady is plunged by Lancelot's song. We are left now to determine the significance of the final song sung by the Lady, the "carol, mournful, holy," that rises out of her trance, and expresses her new knowledge of reality. It is tragic, and its tragedy is in the engulfment of Apollonian illusion by Dionysian reality. The ego, by objec tifying "things" and placing them outside itself, seeks to identify and individualize itself. But the illusion of indi vidual identity cannot be sustained forever, and this consti tutes the "curse" of the poem. At the beginning of the poem, the Lady has no idea of the nature of the curse. She only 427</page><page sequence="14">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW knows a "whisper" that there is a curse. This whisper is evidently the only vestige left to her in her isolation of her vital connection with the land of subjectivity and natural process, a land Tennyson will later call "the great deep" in Idylls of the King. Her realization of the curse comes when the whisper is turned into Lancelot's song. She is suddenly made aware of the artificiality of her remote world, and consequently of the artificiality of her notion of individuality. Her final song is the burden of that revelation; from the frozen abstraction of her art she is subsumed into the reality of process, the flow of time that leads to death. Her journey down the river to Camelot is in a very real sense her surrender to the forces of life and, inevitably, death, which Camelot represents. The futile attempt to retain her individuality, by writing her name on the boat, is ironically indicated by Lancelot's recog nition only of the beauty of a mysterious face; the last truth of the poem is the truth of sensuous, living and sad response to visual but nameless beauty. "The Lady of Shalott" does not present us with a value system, nor does it give us a formula concerning the merits of art versus life. It presents us with a deliberate ambiguity, an ambiguity that provides the energy and tension in all of Tennyson's major works. Two kinds of art are presented for us in the poem, the essentially mimetic art of the Lady as weaver, "holding the mirror up to nature," and the non mimetic art of the Lady's final song—which is imitative also, but is not mimetic in the usual sense of objective representa tion. The song imitates not objects in nature, but the vital force of nature which makes objects behave as they do. Both kinds of art have value. The art of the mirror creates the illusion of order, timelessness and eternity; significantly, the first stanza invokes this order through its verbal structure, an eternal present tense. But the picture presented is not eternity. It is time arrested, and therefore is unreal. A sacri fice has been made; life has been sacrificed to art, the dy namic has been made static. When life intrudes into the 428</page><page sequence="15">THE LADY OF SHALOTT tower, the tense begins to shift from present to past, and when we reach the Lancelot section of the poem, we have moved completely into a past which is irrevocable. "All things flow like a stream" as we experience them, and the stream can neither be stopped nor reversed. But in gaining such knowledge, another sacrifice must be made. The artist may no longer hold up the mirror to create the illusive "what might be." He may only represent process, "what is"; and "what is" in "The Lady of Shalott" is no panacea. It is merely the course of time, life and death, the inexorable flow of experience, in which the importance of human values, or individual motivations, is of little signifi cance, as in the case of Lancelot, whose body, as an object in process, acts with a force entirely unknown to his innocent mind to destroy the Lady. Tennyson does not present us with a choice as to the proper function of the artist; he gives us only a picture of two kinds of art. The art of the mirror holds out hope, but its suggestion of control is the result of illusion, and the life of this illusion, like the life of the mirror, is all too precarious and fragile. But the art of the Lady's final song, which traces faithfully and tragically the meaningless flow of experience to death, is tragic; denying immortality or eternity, it leaves us with the image of man as a temporal animal, trapped in the actual, and forced to accept the actual, the curse of time, as the only reality he may know. 429</page></plain_text>
