<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Column of Juppiter in the Museum of Mainz when she put an end to the temporal power of Greece strengthened tenfold by that very act the spiritual dominion of her conquered foe. At the same time by constituting herself the guardian of that dominion she vivified her own ideals, clothing them from henceforth in the literary and artistic forms that were to give them world value and significance. Of this process the Juppiter column of Mainz offers a vivid example. The columnar shape can be traced back to primitive animistic beliefs carried on to a late date by Roman religious conservatism, while its sculptures interpret in the terms of Graeco-Ionian art the aspiration and achievement of the state under the Julio-Claudian dynasty. In other words, the spirit of Greek anthropomorphism has transformed the holy pillar of primitive Roman ritual into what is essentially a storied column, a colonna storiata expressive of the whole policy of an empire. It would be difficult to overstate the significance of the column for the history of the later antique.16 By a simple variation17 its system of superposed parallel reliefs develop into the unbroken spiral bands which enfold the shafts of the columns of Trajan and of Marcus Aurelius and carry up to the skies the continuous record of the imperial campaigns. The "act of adoration in stone", which brings visibly before us the source whence the Empire sought for strength and prosperity, has its natural sequel in those " epics in stone " which are the conquering policy of Rome made mani- fest. IV To the Juppiter columns succeeded the "Juppiter and Giant" columns, surmounted by the group of a divinity riding over a fallen anguipede figure."8 16 There are other Juppiter columns of similar character to the one discussed above, but none, I think, so early in date or where the shaft is so completely covered with reliefs. Most of the examples come from Roman Germania, but it is interesting to note that the fragment of such a column has been found at Cirencester; see F. Hertlein, Die Juppiter Gigantenslalen (Stutt- gart, I910), p. 53, who quotes for the Cirencester fragment Hiibner in West Deutsche Korrespondenzblatt, Vol. x, 1891, ? 89. '7It seems simpler as well as truer to the processes of the evolution of artistic form to imagine the parallel strips giving way-under the influence of the continuous narrative style of later imperial sculpture-to the continuous spiral, than to con- sider, as does Theodor Birt (Buchrolle, p. 272 f.), the long carved rotutlls of the Trajan column to be directly imitated from the inscribed strip wound about the a'KvTrdX or herald's staff. The group was long explained as Juppiter com- bating a giant. Then, again, "Juppiter" was claimed by the German and Celtic mythographers to be a Celtic or German storm-god. I myself tentatively suggested that the group represented a Syrian Baal on horseback, a sort of Atos Ltnnrros coursing over the earth symbolized by a giant.19 But I have come to see that, whatever the original elements out of which the group and the rest of the decoration were evolved, the character and intention of the column have become as purely Roman as that of the " Juppiter columns ". Both types are intended to symbolize in the provinces the imperial rule. The group of rider and " giant " represents the Imperium Romanumn or the Numen Augusti riding down a conquered foe. "The columns, according to F. Cumont,20 are put up to the deified emperors in order to celebrate their victories over the barbarians; and the anguipede figures are symbolical of the enemy trodden under foot by the victorious Caesars ". This interpreta- tion was called forth by the last discovered "Juppiter and Giant" column at Yzeures in the Indre-et-Loire,21 the few fragmentary reliefs of which brilliantly confirm the theory. The temple within which the fragments were found was itself dedicated Numinibus A ugustorium et Minervce. The shaft, now lost, was supported on three superposed bases; on the middle block of the three are scenes from a "gigantomachia", itself a subject com- monly used, as at Pergamon, to commemorate the defeat of barbarians. Its two remaining reliefs show respectively the deliverance of Andromeda by Perseus and that of Hesione by Hercules, both being emblematic of the "liberation of territory by the agency of the Caesars, assimilated here to the heroes of fable" (Cumont). Thus in this case, as in that of the column of Mainz, the intention is to give visible form to the beneficent rule of the emperor, to the blessings that accrue therefrom, whether in war or in peace. 18These columns have been exhaustively discussed by Dr. Hertlein in the monograph cited above. 19 See my article in Journtal of Roman Studies, Vol. I, p. 23. 20Revue Archeologique, I912, Vol. II, p. 211 if. (article by E. Esperandieu on the column of Yzeures). Cumont refers the theory to Alexander Riese, Die GigantenscYulen. It had also been put forward by F. Haug (see Hertlein, op. cit., p. 63). 21 Esp6randieu, Bas-Reliefs de la Gaule Romaine, Vol. IV, Nos. 2997-2999. THE NEW PRINT GALLERY, THE BRITISH MUSEUM I-BY BOWYER NICHOLS. II-BY CAMPBELL DODGSON I-NEW DRAWINGS HE opening of the new galleries at the museum has given an opportunity f ff and a pretext for the exhibition of some of the more recent acquisitions in several departments. The collection of early German and Flemish coloured woodcuts, though it has received some notable additions since the accession of the present keeper, is not indeed new; but it has never been shown before and is certainly one of the most striking features of the exhibition. The cumulative attraction, interest, and decorative value of the display, when hung in a large series of cases against these walls, i63</page><page sequence="2">The New Print Gallery, the British Museum will be to many visitors a revelation. Some of them may possibly be even tempted to conclude that German art, for all its admirable effort, enter- prise, and learning, has never since compassed any results more completely satisfying to the aesthetic sense than these primitive and popular images of devotion. Of these, however, it is not proposed here to speak; but to offer a few notes on certain of the drawings, British and foreign, over a hundred and fifty of which are shown for the first time. These have all been acquired, either by gift or purchase, since the beginning of I912. A large number are from the Heseltine collection, and these appear to have been all presented either by the owner or other benefactors. Of what is probably the greatest treasure among them, and moreover a new discovery, the pair of early Leonardo drawings in pen-and-ink, an account and a reproduction have already appeared in these pages last August. Small and slight as it is, the second of these two sketches, that of a young girl carrying a naked child, contains pro- portionately as much of the specific and essential Leonardesque quality, the blend of energy and delicacy, the heroic grace, as any design of the master. Next certainly in importance among the Italian subjects may be counted the two Andrea del Sarto drawings in sanguine, given by Mr. Heseltine; the larger of these is of particular interest as representing a famous lost work, the Madonna and Child with S. John painted in fresco for a tabernacle in the wall near the Ingesuati convent outside Porta a Pinti at Florence. Copies exist, but the original is almost entirely destroyed. Among the Uffizi drawings are some minor studies for it by the master's hand, as well as a careful but weak I8th-century version of the whole com- position. In marked contrast with this is the museum drawing, which indeed Mr. Berenson has even characterized as the "most transcendently masterly ", the "swiftest, boldest, most prodigious" of Andrea's drawings. This is transcendent praise. Not every student will follow so far; but the design, a robust and imposing study of a summary and preliminary kind, worked out, as the same critic has noted, altogether independently of models, is a splendid one, bringing us very near to the master, whom we actually seem to observe in search and discovery, as he clears the way to and adjusts the expression of a stately and monu- mental motive. This, again to quote Mr. Berenson, comes nearer to Michelangelo than any of Andrea's designs, though the influence and debt are possibly less conscious and direct than he is inclined to make them in connecting it with a drawing by Sebastiano del Piombo at Windsor, supposedly after one by Michelangelo himself. The other Andrea drawing is a sheet of sketches for the 164 Madonna del Sacco. Both are notable additions to the Print Room collection. Among the other Italian drawings the study by Domenico Cresti for a decorative painting (now in the Uffizi) of the entry of Margaret of Austria into Ferrara before her marriage with Philip III, is an effective sketch of some historical value ; and the four allegorical figures with emblems, in grisaille, ascribed to the school of Pietro da Cortona, designed for the dome of some building not yet identified, are rather exceptionally agreeable and accomplished work of their kind. There are some half-dozen new drawings of the German school, among which one might call spe- cial attention to the charming little pen drawing by Sebald Beham, in illustration of the proverb, " Der Hoffart sitzt der Bettel auf der Schleppe ", resem- bling those of a series of the same kind and scale in the Louvre. A more attractive example could hardly be desired. An anonymous drawing of a rocky landscape, which hangs next the Beham, is also a fine example of expressive work in the German open line convention, which so easily degenerates into incoherence, emptiness, or mere calligraphy unless eye and hand alike preserve the most vigilant self-control. Another anonymous drawing, S. Jerome in Penitence (I9), in pen, ink and white on a dark-grey ground, of the school of Antwerp, may also be mentioned as of some im- portance. Greatly influenced by Diirer, it yet displays intrinsic character and much trained ability of its own. Fromentin has noted with great truth a charac- teristic in Rubens's painting which may easily be missed, the contrast which constantly exists be- tween matter and manner, the extreme sobriety and economy of means employed to compass the most daring and exuberant effects: " il se contient autant qu'il l'abandonne ". This observation may be extended to his drawings, in some of which with a blond suave line, almost unaccented, little reinforced with modelling, as light as an Ingres and more flexible and spontaneous if less puncti- lious in its "probity ", he will convey a sense of volume, structure, and variety of form unsurpassed. A magnificent example of this kind of drawing already exists in the Print Room collection, the Study of a Man Shouting. The museum is to be congratulated on a new Rubens drawing of almost equally fine quality, the Study of a TWomanl Kneeling, in black chalk [PLATE I, A], which came from the Crozat, Lawrence, and Heseltine collections, and has been presented by the last owner. The subject, which is doubtful, may perhaps be identified. The figure, though naked, appears to be in an attitude of devotion; it might be a repentant Magdalen, or one of the elect in a Last Judgment. There is a large accession of Dutch drawings, almost without exception from the Heseltine col- lection.

As it seems uncertain whether any other landscape drawing by Flinck exists, this signed and dated piece is of considerable importance. The Head of a Girl by Leendert van der Koogen, a supposed pupil of Jordaens, is attractive at first sight though scarcely resisting a closer scrutiny. Its manner recalls certain heads attributed to Rubens in the Museum itself, in the Louvre, and elsewhere, as to which a doubt suggests itself whether they should not really be credited to Jordaens and his school. A landscape by Aelbert Cuyp-a charming example- another by Jacob Koninck, and a small portrait study by Gerard Dou are all acquisitions of some importance; and among the French drawings a small but very spirited Gericault sketch of a group of men and horses in violent action may also be noted. The English drawings are very numerous and deserve a separate notice. Space only permits the bare mention of one or two. The two Hogarth studies for Industry and Idleness are of interest. For one of these the Museum already possesses a more finished drawing. The Reynolds sketch is perhaps less interesting for itself than for the fact that it contains on the back a rough draft for a famous passage in one of the Discourses. The "portrait sketch" by Beechey is, it should be noted, a careful copy from Sir Joshua's Mrs. Braddyll. The Gainsborough drawing here re- produced [PLATE I, B] is a figure study, evidently for landscape use, of a lad carrying faggots (from the Hibbert collection), and is a masterly example of Gainsborough's power of suggesting the essen- tials of form and action. As with all Gains- borough's work the charm of his drawings seems partly to consist in the very fragility and precariousness of the means employed. His suc- cesses, as Reynolds himself said, might "appear rather the effect of accident than of design"; it is by "a kind of magic" that the thing is done. With the freest of touches, but the most sensitive and selective vision, he renders here the poise, the movement under the weight of the bundle, the youthful strength and rustic grace of his little figure. There is no emphasis as in Millet or Legros, no romantic or evangelic insistence on the dignity and tragedy of labour. This faggot- bearer is no hereditary bondsman, but only a blithe and active hireling intent on the job in hand and on earning an honest wage. It is all quite English and rationalistic and I8th-century. BOWYER NICHOLS. II-THE MADONNA ENGRAVED BY BERNHARDINUS MILNET THE British Museum has recently acquired a famous specimen of the dotted style or maniere criblee [PLATE II], if "notorious" be not a fitter epithet for a print which has gathered round it a century's growth of myth and error since its existence first became known to iconographers.1 Its recorded history dates from September I5th, I818, when Mr. Nathan Hill, of Manchester, bought on a stall at the Frankfort fair a coloured print representing the Virgin and Child, with a label bearing the name "bernhardinus milnet" attached to the passe-partout by which it is en- closed. On December I5th he wrote from Antwerp to M. van Praet, of the Bibliotheque Royale at Paris, announcing his discovery, and suggesting that a lithographic facsimile should be made. This suggestion was carried out in the course of a few months; a lithograph was made by one Arnaut, of Antwerp, and forty impressions were issued in 1820, six of which were coloured in imitation of the original. One of these was pre- sented to the Bibliotheque Royale (now Nationale, E.a.3 Reserve), and has had the honour of being described as an original by Prof. W. L. Schreiber in his " Manuel de l'Amateur "(Tom. inI, No. 2482). Another was given to Duchesne, in whom it at first inspired a reasonable scepticism with regard to the theory, originated by Van Praet, that the Madonna was the work of the same artist as a much more primitive S. Bernardine, dated 1454, in the Paris collection. Duchesne ended, however, by adopting this hypothesis and carrying it further, attributing to the same artist ("Essai sur les Nielles ", I826, p. io, and " Voyage d'un Iconophile ", I834, p. 223) several other prints at Paris and Berlin. From this it was but a short step to the description of the dotted style in general as " Maniere de Bernard (sic) Milnet". Duchesne, not content with the reckless attribution of other dotted prints to the same engraver, concluded that this engraver was a Frenchman, because his name ended in "et" and S. Bernard (sic) was a French saint. The "h" in "bernhardinus" points, however, rather to a German origin, while the features of the Virgin and the style of the drapery suggest a rather late date (about I480) and the Lower Rhine as the probable locality. The watermark is a very small bull's head. Even if the name upon the print be that of an engraver, to which the name "barthol- meus " upon another print in the British Museum (Schreiber, 2218) affords a parallel, we are not strictly justified in attributing to the artist any- thing more than the border to which the label is attached; but, still, the fact that border and subject were printed together makes the theory of their common authorship most probable. All the literature about this print is based upon a study of the facsimile, the original being now reproduced by photography for the first time. A different reproduction from that circulated by Hill in 1820 appeared in Ottley's posthumous " Inven- tion of Printing" (1863), and may have been made 1 See the Catalogue of Early German Woodcuts in the British Museum, Vol. I, I903, pp. 157 and 566, and the literature there quoted. 169</page><page sequence="6">The New Print Gallery, the British Museum in England direct from the original before the author's death in 1836, but there is no evidence that any competent critic ever saw the print again until I90I, when it was deposited for a time at the British Museum after the death of Mr. F. R. Atkin- son, to whom Mr. Nathan Hill presented it before his death in 1856. It has now been purchased from the executors of that gentleman's son, Mr. HIenry Atkinson. It has always remained in private ownership at Manchester, and Schreiber was mis- taken in describing it as forming part of the Althorp collection. Another impression, without the border, was once in the Weigel collection and passed through the hands of Mr. L. Rosenthal, of Munich, into private ownership. The only perfect specimen will henceforth be accessible to students, and is at present exhibited in the gallery among the recent acquisitions, and not in the series of wood- cuts and metal-cuts described in the printed guide. The print is more gaily coloured than most of its class, since a considerable amount of ultra- marine blue is added to the dull crimson, with a EARLY FURNITURE-XVII BY AYMER VALLANCE SUPPLEMENTARY HE coffer [PLATE, A] at Rainham Church, Kent, dates from the reign of Edward III. The method of orna- mentation is somewhat remarkable. The panels, or rather what appear to be panels, are merely low relief carvings executed on the face of the flat board, the end standards, the upper rail and the middle part of the front all being made flush for the purpose. The jointing of the woodwork shows clearly enough in the second panel from the right. Those parts which are in higher relief-viz., the skirting board, the buttresses and the trefoiled arcade-are all planted on to the flat surface-a method which is not very sound structurally, as may be judged from the fact that four out of the original ten buttresses have become detached and lost. This coffer batters very perceptibly towards the ground. A coffer in the church at Faversham, some thirteen miles off, so closely resembles the one at Rainham as to leave no doubt that both were produced at the same time from the same source. A third example, of slightly variant and less elaborate design, formerly existed at Wittersham church, in another part of the same county, but has now disappeared. little yellow and green, to which the palette of the colourists of these metal-cuts was usually restricted. It is, on the whole, in a fine state of preservation, and must rank as a quite important specimen of the dotted manner, though it does not display any of the refinements of technique which are to be found on more complicated examples. There is no diamond, ring, or fleur-de-lis ornament stamped on the metal with punches, no artful grouping of dots of various sizes to express modelling; the dots and strokes are large and coarse, and the white lines leaving small black squares appear to have been produced by the knife rather than the burin. Another dotted print, entirely undescribed and unknown, was purchased at the same time from Mr. Atkinson's collection. It represents the Virgin, whose robe is embroidered with ears of corn, standing in a church; a liberated captive kneels before her, his fetters cast upon the ground, and three angels stand in the background. An exact explanation of the subject has yet to be found. CAMPBELL DODGSON. The chest [PLATE, B] appears to be of Flemish or northern-French work of the beginning of the I6th century. The widening of the top part of the middle stile, to provide space for the lockplate (unfortunately now wanting) should be noticed. The ends of this chest consist each of two linen- panels of the simplest form, with a single arris apiece. The height of the chest is 2 ft. 5 in. and the length over all is 5 ft. 3 in. The oak cupboard [PLATE, C] has panels of a well-known type of late-Gothic design, derived from the linen-pattern, but with narrow bands instead of folds, branching out above and below into a pair of ogees. The effect is exceedingly handsome, notwithstanding the motif is almost as simple as that of the linen-fold itself. In this example it need scarcely be pointed out that the panels of the lowest tier have been cut short to adapt them to the exigencies of the corner cup- board; and that the hinges are of a much later period than the panels themselves, which belong to the first quarter of the i6th century. (I have to thank Mr. George Gibbs and Messrs. A. B. Daniell and Sons for photographs of the chest and oak cupboard belonging to them re- spectively.) AN ENGLISH SILVER CHALICE AND PATEN, BY H. D.
