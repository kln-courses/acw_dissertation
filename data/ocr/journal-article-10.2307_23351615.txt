CAO ZHI (192-232) AND HIS POETRY Order No. DA8319400 CUTTER, Robert Joe, Ph. D. University of Washington, 1983. 565pp. Chairperson: Professor David R. Knechtges The Jian'an Period is commonly regarded as an important age in Chinese literary history, and Cao Zhi (192-232) is its premier representative. This dissertation is a study of both Cao's life and his poetry, a dual approach that is appropriate because the bulk of Cao's poetry has almost always been read as a very close reflection of his life. An examination of his poems shows, however, that while Cao's life is far from irrelevant to his poetry, pieces in which his own experiences play a significant informing role may be fewer than usually thought. The dissertation is divided into six chapters and two appendices. Chapter 1 presents Cao Zhi's life in summary, emphasizing the play of contradictory forces, and gives a brief introduction to the poetry. The remaining chapters contain annotated translations and discussions of Cao's poems arranged in thematic categories. Chapter 2 examines the symposium poems, those pieces which stand in some relationship to occasions of feasting and drinking, and finds that some exhibit concern with passage of time, which is probably attributable to the tumultuous times in which they were written. Chapter 3 contains Cao's poems of solicitude, of parting and separation, and of the wanderer, by and large closely related to the times or Cao's life. In Chapter 4 his poems on immortality are presented, and the opinion is expressed that, contrary to what some think, Cao did not</page><page sequence="2">340 Dissertation Abstracts turn to a belief in magico-religious Daoism late in life. Chapter 5 is comprised of poems on service to the state, poems of women, and historical poems. Based on his prose writings, it is held that several of the poems on service to the state express Cao's ambitions. It is also held that scholars have often gone to excess in reading the poems of women as allegories for Cao's relations with the ruler. Chapter 6 shows that for Cao Zhi literary work was a way to immortal fame, but as such was less good than achieving greatness through deeds. Appendix A is a translation of Cao's standard biography. Appendix B studies Cao's fall from favor and failure to gain the heir apparency. MASTERS OF THE DANCE: THE ROLE OF T'lEN IN THE TEACHINGS OF THE EARLY JUIST (CONFUCIAN) COMMUNITY (VOLUMES I AND II) Order No. DA8412135 ENO, Robert, Ph.D. The University of Michigan, 1984. 544pp. Chairman: Donald Munro Originally a religious term, from the sixth century B.C. on, the word "t'ien," or "heaven" played a significant role in discourse among philosophical schools. The earliest of these was Juism (Confucianism). This study analyzes statements concerning T'ien in three early Juist texts: the Analects, Mencius, and Hsun Tzu. Previous analyses of the role of T'ien in Juism have viewed that role in terms of a model evolving meanings of "t'ien" during the late Chou period, which claims that the term originally denoted an anthropomorphic deity, but increasingly came to denote "Nature." Studies of the role of T'ien in Juist texts have explored whether this model fits those texts. This essay holds that to identify chracteristically Juist meanings of the term "t'ien," we must do more than identify referential images which may have been associated with its uses in Juist texts. We should, instead, explore the function which uses of the term may have had in relation to activities and goals of the early Juist school. The focus of those activities and goals has traditionally been understood as a political program. This study argues that early Juism was essentially a socially insular cult devoted to mastery of traditional ritual skills; political purism functioned to shelter the cult from political responsibilities and dangers. If this is correct, the role of T'ien in early Juist texts should reflect a disjunction between ritual and political spheres. And indeed we find that throughout the three texts analyzed, the term "t'ien" is generally employed to picture a supreme ethical entity—whether a god, Fate, or Nature--as a prescriptive basis</page><page sequence="3">Dissertation Abstracts 341 for ritual practice in the present, or as a descriptive force ensuring that Juist political efforts will be futile in the present and successful in the future. Thus, in early Juist rhetoric, T'ien is used to justify Juism's ritual focus and legitimize its contemporary withdrawal from political activity. This is the characteristic instrumental meaning of the term "t'ien" in early Juist texts, remaining central despite changes in connotative imagery associated with the term in late Chou thought. CHINESE MATRIARCHY: CLUES FROM LEGENDS AND CHARACTERS Order No. DA8321344 FROST, Molly Spitzer, Ph.D. Georgetown University, 1982. 237pp. Taoists maintain that in pre-Chou times the Chinese knew only their mother and not their father because the sexual unions were free, without the binding effect of matrimony. It is obvious that in a society without formal marriage, the children would also take their names from their mothers. For, in the words of Ashley Montagu, "Maternity is a matter of certainty, paternity is a matter of inference." Many tantalizing clues point to the existence of early Chinese matriarchy. For example, all of the legendary culture heroes such as Huang Ti and Shen Nung are said to be products of miraculous conception, possessing a mother but not a father. All take their names from their mothers as well. Mu Liu-sen's study of Pai Chia Hsing reveals that a name such as Chi-£|£. (Huang Ti1 s surname, from his mother) is considered the most venerated and ancient of all Chinese names. The very word for "name," hsing, contains the female radical. Futhermore, at least 20* of all modern Chinese surnames are derived from names with the female radical. Anthropologists such as Marvin Harris point out the importance of a mother's brother in the nurture of her children within a matriarchal system, since the father might be absent or unknown. In Shang times, kingly succession was believed to have gone from uncle to sororal nephew, and the uncle-sororal nephew bond has traditionally been strong. A major portion of the paper is devoted to a study of the female radical section of the Shuo Wen Chieh Tzu of Hsu Shen who lived about 100 A.D. This section gives us the fewest clues concerning early matriarch, perhaps because of the relatively late date of compilation of the Shuo Wen, but we do learn some interesting things about the role of women in Han times. The development of agriculture and the resulting material</page><page sequence="4">342 Dissertation Abstracts progress were apparently the most significant factors in the evolution from matriarchy to patriarchy in China. As men settled into farming they were able to keep an eye on their wives and children in a way not possible within a hunting society. Anthropological theory and facts of Chinese history are compared to determine the nature and the time of the transition. THE MO-TZU AND THE LU-SHIH CH'UN-CH'IU: A CASE STUDY OF CLASSICAL CHINESE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF ARGUMENT Order No. DA8413390 GARRETT, Mary Margaret, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, 1983. 403pp. Most Chinese philosophers relied heavily on argument by comparison (i.e., analogy, example, simile, and metaphor). They used syllogistic deduction only occasionally, and never engaged in hypothetico-deduction. Neither sinologists nor rhetoricians have been able to explain this phenomenon, and this is because they lack an empirically based epistemological theory. In this study I use an adaptation of Piaget's stage theory of cognitive development to account for the typical Chinese pattern of reasoning. In chapter 1 I analyze the works of the one school that did argue by syllogistic and hypothetico-deductive reasoning, the later Mohists, and show that their thought belongs to the final stage of cognitive growth in Piaget's model. In chapter 2 I turn to the Lu-shih ch'un-ch'iu, a book which illustrates particularly well the tendency to reason by comparison. I argue that the patterns of reasoning and the world-view of this work represent a stage of intellectual development qualitatively unlike those described in Piaget. In chapter 3 I explain the roughly complementary distribution of argument by comparison and deductive argument between these two nearly contemporaneous works in terms of the class affiliations of their authors. The later Mohiststwere associated with the lower class, while the authors of the Lu-shih ch'un-ch'iu belonged to the upper class. This meant that they dealt with significantly different material and social environments, they exploited literacy and education in different ways, and they participated in intellectual exchange to different degrees, all of which influenced the course of their respective cognitive development. I conclude by considering the implications of this study for modern Western theory of argument. Application of the Piagetian model demonstrates the usefulness of an epistemological theory in the analysis of argumentation. The interpretation of the Chinese materials with this model reveals a number of culture-bound assumptions underlying Western theory of argument. This in turn suggests the need for a reexamination of the ways in which</page><page sequence="5">Dissertation Abstracts 343 Westerners actually reason and persuade others. The explanatory power of the Piagetian epistemology supports it as a strong candidate for interpreting the results of such an examination. TUNG CHUNG-SHU AND THE NEW TEXT CONFUCIAN VICTORY, WITH A TRANSLATION OF HIS THREE MEMORIALS TO EMPEROR WU. HELLIWELL, D.J. M.Litt. Thesis. University of Durham (England), 1981. AN IC0N06RAPHIC STUDY OF TWO LATE HAN FUNERARY MONUMENTS: THE OFFERING SHRINES OF THE WU FAMILY AND THE MULTICHAMBER TOMB AT HOLINGOR. (VOLUMES I AND II) Order No. DA8407754 JAMES, Jean Middleton, Ph.D. The University of Iowa, 1983. 499pp. Supervisor: Associate Professor Robert A. Rorex The purpose of this dissertation is to describe and then to interpret the imagery employed in two late Han funerary monuments, the offering shrines of the Wu family in Shantung (c. A.D. 147 168) and the multi-chamber chamber tomb near Holingor in Inner Mongolia (c. A.D. 180-185). Earlier monuments, paintings from Western Han tombs in Hunan and Honan, are studied first as examples of the patterns of Han funerary iconography. Early Eastern Han monuments, the shrine at Hsiao T'ang Shan and a tomb in the same vicinity near the village of Fei-ch'eng in Shantung, are considered next. It is suggested that the Hsiao T'ang Shan shrine provides a model for the later Wu shrines. The necessity to treat all the motifs in each shrine in relation to each other and to the function of the shrine is stressed. Similarly, all the paintings in the tomb at Holingor must also be interpreted as parts of a program of decoration. Finally, the need to differentiate between the meaning of the scenes in shrines and the same sort of scenes in tombs is noted. REALMS OF EXPLANATION: THEORY AND ILLUSTRATIONS Order No. DA8329734 KINOSHITA, Joyce, Ph.D. Stanford University, 1983. 184pp. How do explanations explain? In my thesis, I examine how C.G. Hempel and N.R. Hanson answer this question; I then propose</page><page sequence="6">344 Dissertation Abstracts my own answer, and finally illustrate my proposed theory with applications of chemical explanations and I Chinq explanations. Hempel claims that explanations explain an event's occurrence by showing that is it just what we should have expected, given the laws of nature and the prevailing conditions. Hanson protests that this characterization admits as explanations "mere actuarial" correlations. He maintains that explanations explain something by telling us how the thing fits in what we already know. In my own proposal, I try to show how each of these two views are correct. I claim the kinds of questions one can ask, and correspondingly, the kinds of explanation one can give, are dependent on what entities are in the given realm of discourse. Explanation is thus one of two related types of activities: orienting an entity's within a given realm of discourse, or amplifying, or filling out, an entity's aspect. What counts as an explanation is dependent on the realm of discourse. I view explanation as that which answers certain kinds of "what questions"; to explain something is to say of it what it is. I attempt to show how analyses of various specific kinds of explanation (Hempelian, teleological, causal) fit my characterization as special cases. I follow this theoretical discussion with two illustrations. In Chapter Three, I apply this theory to the history of chemistry. I argue that the questions asked were dependent upon the prevaling conceptions of the nature of chemical substance; the explanation given illuminated some aspects of a chemical substance. Chapter Four is an application of this theory to the use of the I Chinq. I argue that during the time the Tso-chuan was written, the I Chinq provided the ontological basis for explanations which were structurally sound. A situation was explained by showing it to be an aspect of some given developmental regularity, and by providing that regularity's other aspects. THE SIGNIFICANCE AND EXTENT OF TAOIST INFLUENCE ON THE GOVERNMENT OF THE EARLY HAN. LAU, Lawrence Pok Ming. (Ph.D. in History) University of Alberta, 1981. xi, 236pp. Order copies from the Canadian Theses on Microfiche Service, National Library of Canada, Ottawa K1A 0N4; available only in microfice format, fiche no. 53967.</page><page sequence="7">Dissertation Abstracts 345 SUNG KAO-TSUNG, MA HO-CHIH, ANO THE MAO SHIH SCROLLS: ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE CLASSIC OF POETRY Order No. 8118354 MURRAY, Julia K., Ph.D. Princeton University, 1981. 306pp. A number of handscrolls dispersed among collections throughout the world illustrate portions of the Mao arrangement of the Shih chinq (Classic of Poetry). The calligraphic texts of the scrolls are written in the small-regular script (hsiao-k'ai-shu) traditionally attributed to the hand of the Southern Sung emperor Kao-tsung (r. 1127-1162), while the paintings are said to be by Ma Ho-Chih. In this dissertation, all the Mao Shih scrolls are studied critically and categorized according to their relationship with the twelfth-century set. Of the scrolls curently available for study, seven are shown by stylistic analysis to be probable members of the original group: "Odes of Pin" (Metropolitan Museum), "Odes of Ch'en" (British Museum), "Odes of T'ang" and "Ch'inq-miao" (Liaoning Provincial Museum), "Six Odes starting with Hunq-yen" (Dillon collection), "Six Odes starting with Nan ,yu chia-y(i" (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), and "Eleven Odes starting with T'ang" (Fujii Yurinkan, Kyoto). Several other strong contenders belonging to collections in the People's Republic of China are at present completely inaccessible for study. Comparison of the calligraphy in the seven "primary" scrolls with a signed and datable work by Kao-tsung, "Preface to the Collected Writings of Hui-tsung" (1154), shows that Kao-tsung did not write the Mao-Shih texts himself. Two other hands are evident in them, one for the Fujii and Boston scrolls, and the other for the two Liaoning, Metropolitan, British Museum, and Dillon scrolls. In both groups, homophones for the personal names of Kao-tsung and his successor Hsiao-tsung (r. 1162-1189) are written with strokes missing to respect a strict taboo. The pattern of taboo observance, considered together with the calligraphers' general dependence on Kao-tsung's calligraphic style, suggests that the Mao Shih scrolls might have been written by persons closely associated with Kao-tsung between the time that he abdicated the throne to Hsiao-tsung in 1162 and his death in 1187. The Empress Wu (1115-1197) may have been one of the "substitute" calligraphers. The painting techniques and motifs of the seven scrolls seem in general to be the work of one artist, displaying, however, some variety among the group in speed and care of execution. The essential homogeneity of the primary group is underlined also by contrast with an acknowledged later copy, Hsiao Yun-ts'ung's "Odes of Ch'en" (National Palace Museum, Taiwan), as well as with anonymous later versions of other scrolls. The twelfth-century date of the primary scrolls is established through comparisons with archaeologically excavated or otherwise securely documented</page><page sequence="8">346 Dissertation Abstracts pictorial material. Although illustrations of portions of the Mao Shih by artists of the Six Dynasties and T'ang periods are recorded in early histories of painting, these seem not to have been available as models for Ma Ho-chih in the twelfth century, for they are not recorded in the imperial collection. Furthermore, none of Ma's scrolls is consistently archaic in compositional structure; and the archaisms that do occur may largely be explained by the influence of Li Kung-lin (1049-1106). As textual illustrations, the Mao Shih paintings follow the standard, conservative interpretations of pre-Sung commentaries to the Shih ching poems. Several conceptual strategies are used in translating the poems into pictures: illustration of the nature imagery in the poems, the context in which they might be sung, the "story" told in them, the speaker or interpreter, and so forth. Each scroll contains a unique mixture of these types, reflecting differences between the textual chapters themselves. The scrolls, finally, are compared with other examples of textual illustration in the handscroll format. In contrast to these other works, the Mao Shih illustrations are shown to be evocations of the spirit of classical antiquity, rather than literal translations of verbal information into pictorial equivalents. EARLY CONFUCIANISM AND INHERITED THOUGHT IN THE LIGHT OF SOME KEY TERMS OF THE CONFUCIAN ANALECTS. I. THE TERMS IN SHU CHING AND SHIH CHING. NIKKILft, Pertti. Th.D. dissertation. University of Helsinki (Finland), 1982. Published under the same title. Helsinki: Societas Orientalia Fennica, 1982. 275pp. (Studia Orientalia, 53). EARLY CHINESE ASTRONOMY AND COSMOLOGY: THE "MANDATE OF HEAVEN" AS EPIPHANY Order No. DA8329762 PANKENIER, David Willi am, Ph.D. Stanford University, 1983. 358pp. The purpose of this investigation is twofold. First, it seeks to clarify the history of early Zhou astronomy and astrology, and to establish the historicity of accounts of significant celestial phenomena that are recorded in the Bamboo Annals and in other Zhou and Han Dynasty sources. Second, in so doing, it strives to demonstrate the crucial role of planetary</page><page sequence="9">Dissertation Abstracts 347 cycles in reconstructing not only the absolute chronology of Shang and Western Zhou but also the historical development of the concept of the "Mandate of Heaven." The principal focus of the study is on integrating modern methods of verifying astronomical observations with a traditional philological approach to textual scholarship. The issue of the questionable historicity of the "current" version of the Bamboo Annals and the problem of the late Shang and Early Zhou chronology are examined in depth. The investigation demonstrates that the conferral of the "Mandate of Heaven" was signalled by a manifestation of heavenly approval of the dynastic founder in the form of highly unusual alignments of all five visible planets in 1576 and 1059 B.C. Once the astronomical dates of such strategic celestial events recorded in the Bamboo Annals are correctly identified, it becomes possible to unravel the history of successive, systematic distortions of the chronicle. It is shown that the observations of planetary phenomena recorded in the Bamboo Annals and the coherent chronology in which they are embedded derive from contemporary accounts. The 517-year period of the planetary alignments associated with the conferral of the Mandate is found to underlie the venerable Zhou tradition that virtuous dynastic founders arise at intervals of five hundred years. The coexistence during the Zhou Dynasty of written records displaying a high degree of observational skill and of mythicized renderings of the same events in symbolic language attests to the integrity of independent modes of transmission of such data, the one archival and written and the other mythological and oral. The historic roles of these periodic revelations of Heaven's will bears importantly on our understanding of the scientific and political culture of Shang, Zhou and Han Dynasties. THE WORTHY UNEMPLOYED: A STUDY OF THE POLITICAL THOUGHT IN THE COMMENTS OF A RECLUSE (CH'IEN-FU LUN) OF WANG FU (FL. A.D. 150) Order No. DA8312163 PEARSON, Margaret Jean, Ph.D. University of Washington, 1983. 331pp. Chairman: Professor Jack L. Dull The Comments of a Recluse by Wang Fu has had a major influence on Chinese intellectual history. It is one of the very few extant primary sources of information on the governmental activities and daily life of the middle years of the Later Han dynasty (A.D. 25-220). Secondly, Wang Fu has been recognized as an exemplar by later reformers in China and Japan. In addition, the book is one of the longest surviving works representing the syncretic and critical thinking of Later Han dissidents.</page><page sequence="10">348 Dissertation Abstracts To use the Comments as an historical source, we need to understand his attitudes and opinions, and to see those opinions in the context of the problems and debates of his time. This dissertation deals with both tasks, and also provides essential background information for this first extended anlysis of Wang Fu's political thought and translations of major portions of Comments. To Chinese political theorists' continuing debates on human nature, Wang Fu contributed his ideas and developed the concept of the worthy ( ^ ) and related this concept to governmental institutions and practices. Like others of his time, he considered worthies to have both strengths and weaknesses; unlike many, he thought such men were far from rare in his own era. For Wang Fu, even, the weaknesses of worthies were useful if they were recognized honestly and used appropriately, by the individual in his life-long education, and by the ruler in making official assignments. In addition to this analysis of human nature, education and the methods of selecting the worthy, Wang Fu also described what he felt would improve operation of the existing governmental structure, one in which an active ruler determined policy and supervised officials while allowing them considerable autonomy in their implementation of these policies in their mandated jurisdictions. These arguments were not abstract theories but a response to the conditions of his day. Wang Fu had, through his friendships with Chang Heng, Tou Chang, Ma Jung, and Ts'ui Yuan, access to information on the dominance of the consort clans, selection procedures, and governmental structure. Therefore, we can conclude that the Comments are indeed "sufficient" for the observation of the customs and government of that time: as stated by Fan Yeh, the author of the standard History of Later Han. THE ROLE OF THE STATE OF CHU IN EASTERN ZHOU PERIOD CHINA: A STUDY OF INTERACTION AND EXCHANGE IN THE SOUTH Order No. DA8329280 PETERS, Heather A., Ph.D. Yale University, 1983. 539pp. Historians and archaelogists investigating the history of the Eastern Zhou period (770-221 B.C.) in China have tended to focus their attention on the development of and the interaction among the centers located primarily in northern China. This dissertation aims to focus instead on the southern centers usually regarded as peripheries. Chu, a major southern center in Hubei and Hunan associated with both textual and archaeological data, sits on the interface between China's north and south, the Yangtze River. Because of</page><page sequence="11">Dissertation Abstracts 349 this location, I suggest that a detailed analysis of the Chu state, social structure and civilization could provide a means to obtain more information about development and interaction in the South. We are fortunate that Chinese historical material from the Eastern Zhou period is both abundant and informative. Because of the availability of both documents and archaeological material from this period, I take the methodological approach of the historical archaeologist which implies the critical interplay between the two sets of data. Through my analaysis of the Chu state, social structure and civilization I was able to gain a broader perspective on South China during the Eastern Zhou period and gathered more information on the centers that existed in this region during this time. The dissertation indicates the need for further research in South China and the necessity to not view the region simply as a peripheral backwater of Chinese civilization. The fruitful combination of the early historical documents together with the archaeological material demonstrates the significance Chinese archaeology has for the research in the development and formation of early complex societies.

THE COMPOSITION OF THE ZHOUYI Order No. DA8320774 SHAUGHNESSY, Edward Louis, Ph.D. Stanford University, 1983. 376pp. Since its canonization during the Han dynasty as the first among China's classics, the Zhou.yi or Book of Changes has been</page><page sequence="12">350 Dissertation Abstracts regarded as a wisdom text created by sages and having a universal meaning. In this study, however, I demonstrate that it is instead the product of a definite historical context, within which it fulfilled a particular function and possessed a particular meaning. Part One of the dissertation describes the context of the Zhou.yi, discussing first the date of the text's composition, and second, its original function. By way of a four part argument, based on historical citations of the text, the development of its poetic style, philological studies of its vocabulary, and an analysis of the contemporary political history, I conclude that the text must have been composed during the first decades of the reign of King Xuan (r. 827-782 B.C.) I then demonstrate that while traditions associating the Zhouyi with milfoil divinination are generally authentic, the divination procedures stadardized during the Han dynasty are certainly anachronistic in their detail. Through analysis of the divination narratives in the Zuozhuan, the earliest sources for the Zhou.yi, a reconstruction of the original divination procedure is suggested. Part Two presents a structural analysis of the text. Among the conclusions arrived at here are the intrinsic insignificance of the sixty-four hexagram pictures, the functional distinction between hexagram statements and line statements, the internal consistency of a line statement's Topic and Prognostication, the functional distinction between Prognostications and Verifications, and the authenticity of the hexagram sequence in the received text. Certainly the most important conclusion, however, is that the six line statements of a single hexagram usually and probably normatively cohere as a single literary unit. By recognizing the "internal logic" of these various parts it is often possible to understand the significance of otherwise obscure images. This thesis is illustrated in the the final chapter, wherein is presented detailed studies of twenty hexagram texts. By describing the Zhouyi within the context of its original composition, the present study will enable future chronologically periodized studies to document the relative development of the Yijinq tradition. THE I CHING: AN ETYMOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE Order No. DA8400051 YU, Titus, Ph.D. California Institute of Integral Studies, 1983. 193pp. Much has been said about the use of the I Chinq, but little attention devoted to its literal meaning in translation since the first rendition in French in the early eighteenth century by P. Jean-Baptiste Regis, a Jesuit missionary who travelled far and</page><page sequence="13">Dissertation Abstracts 351 wide, and lived among the Chinese in China from 1698 on. Most translations worked with the preoccupation that the I Ching was essentially post-feudalistic. As a result, texts were tailored to fit into a preconceived or fabricated pattern or patterns whether it be philosophical, religious, astrological, psychological or even mathematical. In order that the original flavor of the archetypal symbolism of the I Ching might be regained, an etymological approach is adopted. Use of the etymological investigation in translation has involved less critical but still significant procedures that help real original meanings, restore missing imagery, remove added pronouns and articles, reconstruct the metrical system where it would not interfere with the flow of the images and reevaluate known concepts and symbols. It is hoped this research will be conducive to the opening of a new horizon for learners in various fields of academic pursuit. NEW HISTORY OF THE STATES: THE SOURCES AND NARRATIVE STRUCTURES OF A CHINESE FICTIONALIZED HISTORY Order No. DA8322475 ZELDIN, Wendy I., Ph.D. Harvard University, 1983. 409pp. The purpose of this dissertation is to introduce Western readers the textual history and literary features of Feng Meng-lung's New History of the States (Hsin lieh-kuo chih), a fictionalized history about ancient China of the Eastern Chou period. Chapter I assesses the possible motives behind the creation of fictionalized histories (yen-i) in general and of those about the Eastern Chou in particular. It attempts to provide a definition of yen-i and chracterize its flowering during the late Ming. Chapter II describes History of the States (Lieh-kuo chih chuan), the precursor of Feng's New History, in terms of its factual and fictional content. It explores the relationship between History of the States and p'ing-hua and also examines the novel's ties to YUan drama. With Chapter III begins the core of the thesis an analysis of the sources and structures of New History of the States. While Feng used a wide variety of historical works, he also relied more heavily on History of the States than he would have his readers believe. The bulk of the chapter is devoted to a comparison between representative corresponding sections of the two novels for the pupose of showing the extent to which Feng used the earlier work and the ways he improved on it. Chapter IV looks at Feng's literary technique from two perspectives: his structuring of material and his balancing of scene and sunmiary, comment and description. Examples are taken</page><page sequence="14">352 Dissertation Abstracts from Feng's treatment of the story of Wu Tzu-hsu. Chapter V focuses on the poems and the comments accompanying them in Feng's New History, with a view to distinguishing the thematic concerns of the novel, especially the author's approach to history. Chapter VI is devoted to History of the States of the Eastern Chou (Tung Chou lieh-kuo chih), Ts'ai Ao's revision of New History of the States. Selected translations from Ts'ai's commentary are presented, for the commentary was his main contribution and helps account for the great popularity of the novel during the Ch'ing dynasty. Three appendices follow. The first is selected translation from Feng's account of Wu Tzu-hstf, which complements Chapter IV. The second treats editions of the various versions of the novel. The third is a translation of Feng's "General Guidelines" (fan-li) to the New History.</page></plain_text>
