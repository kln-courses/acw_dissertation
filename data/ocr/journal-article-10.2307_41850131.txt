London: Macmillan Caribbean, 1999. xiv + 289 pp. (Paper £14.95) Philip D. Morgan Department of History Johns Hopkins University Baltimore MD 21218, U.S.A. &lt;pmorgan3 @jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu&gt; The distinguished Warwick University Caribbean Studies series could not have chosen a more knowledgeable scholar than Barry Higman to write their first his- toriographical volume. Higman needs no introduction; his pathbreaking mono- graphs on early nineteenth-century slavery, which, as he notes, followed a "firm- ly empirical, quantitative approach" (p. xii), have established him as the pre-eminent historian of the British West Indies. Higman has always been open to interdisciplinary approaches: in addition to his demographic and economic analyses of slavery, he has cultivated a sophisticated spatial awareness (after all, he has a Ph.D. in geography as well as in history), which was perhaps most evi- dent in his Jamaica Surveyed , a superb study of plantation maps. His most recent book, Montpelier Jamaica, which combines all his previously displayed talents but adds to them an interest in material culture and archaeology, is perhaps his finest work. Writing West Indian Histories displays some new interests and sur- prises: a sympathetic interest in popular representations of the past, a willingness to engage with the philosophy of history, and even some autobiographical rev- elations. A reticent - perhaps even taciturn (in the nicest possible way) - Australian, Higman almost unbuttons himself in his preface, not because he wants to engage in confession, but because he wishes us to locate him in time and place, just as he tries to connect the personal and the contextual for the many historians of the West Indies who have preceded him and who are the subject of this book. Higman began living in Jamaica in 1967 and for the next thirty years or so it was his home; he was the second person to be awarded a doctoral degree in History at the University of the West Indies; he married a Jamaican; and from 1983 to 1996 he was Professor of History at the Mona campus. Although he has traveled extensively throughout the British Caribbean, his perspective is shaped by his long residence on this one island; as he notes, "Another historian, writing from another site and another life would have seen it differently" (p. xiii). Having now returned to his native Australia where he is the William Keith Hancock Chair of History at the Australian National University, Higman writes from the perspec- tive of an outsider to the region in which he has lived for most of his professional life.</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 301 What he offers in this book are reflections on the "development of history- writing in the so-called English-speaking Caribbean, looking particularly at the complex interaction between popular and professional understandings of the past" (p. x). The first two chapters of the book lay out the groundwork for the study: the rationale for confining attention to the English-speaking Caribbean, the distinction between amateur and professional, modes of representing the past, and the assembling of a historical record through the work of archives, museums, and libraries. The next three chapters are the most substantive. The first explores West Indian historiography down to the mid- 1930s. It focuses on local amateur historians - from Edward Long to Frank Cundall among whites, from John Jacob Thomas to Norman Eustace Cameron among blacks - and the first professionals, all of whom were foreigners, largely American (such as Frank Wesley Pitman or Lowell Ragatz) or British (such as Vincent Harlow or Richard Pares). The second examines the emergence of a colonial elite, tracing the story from the foundational year of 1938, when Eric Williams became the first West Indian to gain a Ph.D. in history and C.L.R. James published The Black Jacobins , to the early 1960s. This chapter, among other things, includes a lengthy section on the institutional development of the University College of the West Indies and the role of historians as varied as John Parry, Elsa Goveia, and Douglas Hall. A final chapter of this part of the book grapples with issues of political independence and global interdependence - the growth of an indige- nous group of professional historians, the production of doctoral dissertations in West Indian universities, the rise of local journals, and disputes that arose among professionals and that served to alienate them from a wider world. The last four chapters do not so much survey historians as the models, metaphors, and concepts they generally employ. One chapter probes the tenden- cy to employ a good/bad times view of the past - a pre-Columbian paradise, for example; or a golden or silver age of sugar planting; or the rise and decline nar- rative, whether the subject be planters, slavery, or plantations. Another chapter examines a range of biological, anthropomorphic, and mechanical metaphors in modern historical writing about the region: King Sugar, or Darwinian-like strug- gles for power, or graphical thinking that depends on circles (economic cycles, cores and peripheries) or triangles (Atlantic trade, pyramidal social structures). For Higman's historiographical exploration of another mechanical metaphor, see his "The Sugar Revolution" (2000). A third explores emotional approaches to the past, whether the debunking of Columbus or the search for national heroes, the degree to which guilt and forgiveness have been and should be part of historical writing, even the controversial issue of reparations. A short last chapter sketch- es some future possibilities: more inclusive regional works, more comparative research, histories of particular territories and groupings in larger imperial, Atlantic, and global contexts, and more innovative ways of representing the past. This work is certainly the most comprehensive historiographical treatment of the British West Indies yet available. It supplants D. A.G. Waddell's "The British</page><page sequence="3">302 New West Indian Guide /Nieuwe West-Indische Gids vol. 75 no. 3 &amp; 4 (2001 ) West Indies," although readers will want to consult Elsa V. Goveia's A Study on the Historiography of the British West Indies to the End of the Nineteenth Century ; which is still unsurpassed for the period before 1900. The UNESCO General History of the Caribbean volume on methodology and historiography, edited by Barry Higman, which covers the region at large, is also fairly up-to- date. My major criticism of Writing West Indian Histories is that it is too anodyne; it lacks a cutting edge. Historians of modest talents get much the same coverage as the undisputed giants of the field. The work of Richard Pares - most notably his War and Trade in the West Indies, 1739-1763 - is discussed most intensive- ly on less than two pages (pp. 79-80). Perhaps his best book, A West-India Fortune , as well as his Yankees and Creoles, and Merchants and Planters , rate barely a mention (p. 110). Readers of this work might easily think that, say, William Laurence Burn is as important a historian of the British Caribbean as Pares. Even Eric Williams, to whom Higman devotes many pages, is not put under the microscope. Surely readers would have liked to read Higman's inter- pretation of Williams's seminal Capitalism and Slavery , but this book does not provide it. Or, to take one last example, what does Higman think of Seymour Drescher's Econocidel He briefly describes its argument and mentions various critics (p. 164), but readers will not know whether Higman is more inclined to believe Drescher or his Tobagonian critic, Selwyn Canington. In short, this book could have been even better had Higman fully unbuttoned himself, cast off some of his native reticence, and told us what he really thinks about all of the many books and historians he treats in this work. Then Writing West Indian Histories might have been a classic rather than what it is: a valuable survey. References Go veia, Elsa V., 1956.
