Oxford: THE CLARENDON PRESS, 1993. Pp. xiv + 280. $55. In this study, David Wasserstein follows up on his first book, The Rise and Fall of the Party Kings: Politics and Society in Is- lamic Spain, 1002-1086 (Princeton, 1985), with a meticulous examination of the caliphate in al-Andalus during roughly the same period. However, whereas the earlier volume was designed for both scholars in the field and more general readers, this book will appeal primarily to specialists in Taifa politics, Islamic in- stitutions, and numismatics. Here, Wasserstein analyzes Taifa coins and rulers in close detail, working to sort out a period which he himself several times describes as "confused and confusing." The central question addressed here is whether the caliphate, which was established in al-Andalus by the Umayyad ruler CAbd al-Rahman III in 316/929, was abolished a century later in 422/1032, the date of the abdication of the last Umayyad, Hisham III al-MuCtadd. The traditional interpretation of An- dalusi history accepts this latter year as a watershed, a point marking an abrupt change from the centralized rule of the Umayyad caliphs in Cordoba to the decentralized pattern of the subsequent Taifa states. This view was set forth in the 1860s by the Dutch scholar Reinhart Dozy, and he based his periodization on evidence in Andalusi written sources. The eleventh-century historian Ibn Hayyan, for example, who is one of the most im- portant sources for the period (although most of his writings are preserved in the works of others), recounts that "the people of Cordoba agreed to depose him [al-MuCtadd], and they called for the abolition of the caliphate completely [bi-ibtil al-khildfa jum- latan]" (trans. Wasserstein, p. 149). The importance of 422/1031 has been further reinforced by the fact that the seminal work by E. Levi-Provencal, Histoire de I'Espagne musulmane (Paris- Leiden, 1950-1953) ends with this date, because Levi-Provencal died before completing its final volume. This view of Andalusi history is perfectly acceptable if one bases periodization on the transfer of dynastic power, or on the switch from one ruler to many, but it is not valid-as Wasserstein cogently demonstrates-to use the existence or non-existence of the caliphate as a point of demarcation. Although the words of Ibn Hayyan may seem convincing, the phrase ibtdl al-khildfa could also "bear a completely different set of meanings, one with much less far-reaching implications" (p. 150). Wasserstein pre- sents convincing evidence not only to show that the Andalusi ca- liphate was not abolished in 422/1031, but to establish that it was preserved, at least as a concept, into the second half of the elev- enth century. Thus it was the rule of the Almoravids after 1086, and their proclamation of the CAbbasid dacwa, that truly marked a new phase in Andalusi history. To prove his point, Wasserstein delves deeply into the written sources, mining every tidbit of information on "caliphs, counter-caliphs, counterfeit caliphs," and a wide range of other eleventh-century political figures. But, as is clear from the ex- ample of Ibn Hayyan, written materials can be ambiguous. Also, although the eleventh century provides a relatively rich array of Andalusi written materials, a historian of the Taifa period must constantly deal with their gaps and silences. In or- der to counter these difficulties, Wasserstein employs numis- matic data to demonstrate the continuity of the idea of the caliphate. This is a trump card, and it is Wasserstein's pains- taking analysis of Taifa coins that makes this book special. As he puts it, "the coins of Islamic Spain have proved in the past relatively immune to historiographical research. I have sought to bring this material within the bounds of the historian's grasp" (pp. 5-6). He does an excellent job. Far from showing any positive abolition of the caliphate, Taifa coins routinely cite an amir al-mu'minin in their inscrip- tions. Wasserstein assumes a purpose behind Taifa mintings, and does not follow other scholars in dismissing these numismatic references to an amir al-mu'minfn as having no concrete mean- ing, or perhaps referring to the caliph in the East. The problem for Taifa rulers, as he sees it, "was how to maintain the norms of coin inscription in an Islamic environment, and how to main- tain their own claims to some sort of Islamic legitimacy. These norms tended to dictate the mention of a caliph" (p. 117). Thus, in spite of the fact that there was no actual caliph reign- ing in al-Andalus for most of this period, Taifa coins often named the long-gone Hisham III al-MuCtadd as amir al- mu'minfn, or cited an unidentifiable "CAbd Allah." According to Wasserstein it was preferable to inscribe the name of a dead ca- liph, or to use the non-specific "Cabd allah" in place of a real ruler's name. "By this means they fulfilled the norms which had grown up in Islamic Spain during the fourth/tenth century, . . . they laid claim to a form of legitimacy for themselves and for their regimes, and they succeeded also in avoiding any state- ment which might commit them to obedience to anyone outside their own dominions. As a real institution possessed of real significance, the caliphate was by this time almost fully mar- ginalized ... and it was scarcely relevant or even meaningful whether the person named as caliph on coins was a real person or not" (pp. 117-18). This is an ingenious explanation, but it rests on the assumptions that these "norms" had been suffi- ciently established in the century-or-so since the instigation of the caliphate by CAbd al-Rahman III, and also that the caliphate (or at least the concept of the caliphate) had not become so mar- ginalized as to mean nothing. Because of the nature of Wasserstein's argument, most of his chapters are devoted to a highly technical discussion of Taifa personages, their political aspirations, and their coin types. The debate often centers on the scholarly merits of three numisma- tists, Antonio Vives y Escudro, Antonio Prieto y Vives, and George Miles, and the discussion of their identification (and misidentification) of Taifa coins takes up many pages of text and the final three appendices. In all, there are fifteen appendi- ces (taking up the final hundred pages of the book-pp. 165- 490</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books 263), and some of these might as well have been part of the main text, which itself often reads as if it were an invaluable appendix or extended footnote to a more general work. In some respects, the scope of this book is very limited, and Wasserstein himself asks, "why does any of this matter?" (p. 164). He an- swers that "as an example, or a case-study, of the development of a central institution in Islam ... [the Andalusi caliphate] is worthy of study, both for its similarities to other versions of itself and for its differences from them." But Wasserstein has done more here than provide a case-study of the caliphal in- stitution; he has also given us an excellent example of how provocative new answers can emerge when a historian goes be- yond traditional written sources to ask penetrating questions of other types of historical records. OLIVIA REMIE CONSTABLE COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY Vorbild und Vernunft: Die Regelung von Lachen und Scherzen im mittelalterlichen Islam. By LUDWIG AMMANN. Arabis- tische Texte und Studien, vol. 5. Hildesheim: GEORG OLMS VERLAG, 1993. Pp. xii + 287. DM 49.80. With the proliferation in recent years of scholarship con- cerned with humor in the Arabic tradition, the appearance of a monograph laying down the law on laughter and jesting is ap- propriate and timely. Ludwig Ammann's Freiburg dissertation is a thorough and detailed study of medieval Islamic discussions on the permissibility and etiquette of such behavior, focussing in particular on prophetic hadith and its interpretation (Vorbild) but also considering contributions from the medical, philosoph- ical, and literary traditions (Vernunft). Beginning with a handful of inconsistent reports on the Prophet's comportment (he jested, he condemned jesting; he laughed heartily, he only occasion- ally smiled), Ammann shows how attempts to interpret and har- monize the evidence, in part under the influence of non-Islamic cultural norms, developed into articulated ethical stances of con- siderable sophistication. The work is lucidly organized, utilizing outline numbers. Ammann has probably made the right decision in discussing laughter and jesting separately, in two independent chapters, de- spite the close connections between the two subjects, which he is careful to point out. These chapters, the heart of the work, are framed by a "Vorspiel" and a "Nachspiel." The former deals with a number of preliminary and peripheral matters, including the lexicography of laughter and jesting (treated exhaustively), the medical tradition on laughter (divided on whether joy or wonder is its primary stimulus, and whether it is irrational or rational), and theological discussions of such points as God's laughter in the Qur'an (anthropomorphism) and God as agent of laughter and weeping (Qur'an 53:43: wa-annahu huwa adhaka wa-abka--determinism and free will). The Nachspiel considers briefly the social reality behind normative texts, and is followed by a conclusion summarizing the major points of the study. The central chapters on laughing and jesting are organized roughly chronologically, beginning with reports from the Pro- phet and their early interpretation, considering possible "out- side" influences, and tracing later developments, particularly in Islamic pietistic literature. The chapter on jesting also devotes a section to literary apologetics for jesting in adab works, and ap- pends an example of a contemporary ethical work that essen- tially continues the tradition. Despite the existence of hadith depicting the Prophet both smiling and laughing, Ammann shows that the general thrust of early hadith criticism was to emphasize rather the negative side of the evidence. He isolates four clusters of hadith expressing reservations about laughter, and subjects them to meticulous criticism of both the isndd and the matn. For the former he re- lies especially on the "common link" analysis formulated by Schacht and pursued further by Juynboll, although he seems on the whole to be somewhat more optimistic, not to say credu- lous, about the possible historicity of hadith than either of those scholars, arguing in a number of cases, here and else- where, and sometimes rather defensively, for probable authen- ticity. Two of these hadith were particularly important for later discussions, the "Intensitatsregel"-the Prophet only smiled, rather than laughing-which Ammann finds to be a distortion of an earlier less pointed anecdote, and the "Frequenzregel"-the Prophet forbade too-frequent laughter as "fatal to the heart"- which he shows to be a back formation from a statement orig- inally attributed to al-Hasan al-Basri. The minuteness and speculativeness of Ammann's isnad criticism at times strains credibility (and concentration), but it does produce a rich pic- ture of the emergence of the hadith and their manipulation. Pressure to emphasize the strictures against laughter came pri- marily from ascetic circles, especially those of Basra, whose role Ammann sketches, noting as well, and importantly, the existence of non-ascetic pious scholars, such as Ibn Sirin, who opposed such excessive restraint. Ammann then turns to the question of outside influences, most obviously those from ascetic Christian- ity, and sensibly takes a middle position between what he calls "influence" and "convergence" in attitudes, pointing appositely to the importance here of conversion. More briefly considered are possible influences from "Greek" (primarily the pseudonymous Aristotle-Alexander correspondence), Persian, and pre-Islamic Arab traditions, all urging restraint in laughter; the pre-Islamic Arab evidence adduced takes the form mostly of poetic praise of women's reserve, but Ammann does not do much to pursue po- tentially interesting questions of gender differentiation. The main problem confronting pietistic opponents of laughter was a group of reports stating that the Prophet "laughed until his 491</page></plain_text>
