CHU The the the modern technology eras of and photography, of late-modern visual culture. cinema, "animal Vivian and story" Sobchack the electronic developed describes media alongside these of as television revolutions belonging and in to the technology of visual culture. Vivian Sobchack describes these as belonging to the eras of photography, cinema, and the electronic media of television and computers, eras that roughly coincide with Fredric Jameson's history of the cultural logic of market, monopoly, and multinational capitalism. The cinema, Sobchack explains, "made visible for the very first time not just the objective world but the very structure and process of subjective, embodied vision." Viewers experienced moving pictures as the vision of an embodied subjectivity, not their own, that was making intentional visual choices as it moved through space and time. This experience, more- over, made visible the ways in which our own vision was subjective and thus, in which everyone was both viewing subject and visual object at all times (149). In examining London's wolf-dog as negotiating these changes to the concept of modern subjectivity, I work slightly against the grain of literary critical history in reading White Fang, despite London's canonical status as a naturalist, as "cinema- tic." Sobchack ties the cinematic era loosely to Jameson's cultural logics of monopoly Mosaic 40/1 0027-1 276-07/0790 16$02.00©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">80 Mosaic 40/1 (March 2007) capitalism, and modernism. I wish to make it clear, however, that my intent is not to enter into debate about London as a modernist or as a naturalist, or to delineate the characteristics of these styles. Moreover, not all naturalists wrote animal stories, so it would be illogical to argue that an analysis of animal stories of that era would ade- quately address all of naturalism. My focus, instead, is very specific: the cultural logic of the new anthropomorphism evident in the crafting of this animal story. As many of London's readers have noted, the animal of this period is a Darwinian animal; however, the historical moment of the animal as evolutionary/Darwinian subject and as cinematic subject overlapped. Animals and cinema, Akira Mizuta Lippit notes, are historically linked. Cinema and zoological parks proliferated at the same time - simultaneous "contemporary spectacles" (12). Animal movement (often, animal deaths) were some of cinema's earliest objects. "The animal inhabits cinema through its principal mechanism, animation - to make move, live, animal. [. . .] The frequency of animal figures from Etienne- Jules Marey's and Eadweard Muybridge's pre-cinematic photographs to the animations of Winsor McCay and Walt Disney suggests an affinity between animality and cinema that defies, in the end, figurability" (12-13). London incorporates the evolutionary animal into the larger concerns of moving image culture. The second text I will discuss, the anime Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocencey is an "electronic" text. According to Sobchack, the cinematic relies on the singular existence of the material world. It emphasizes a subject whose very coherence emerges from an embodied subjective identity. But there is, as Sobchack, puts it "no-body" behind elec- tronic representation. Rather than ordering space and time, digital technology breaks up - pixelates - bits of "information" across a network of spectators and users. Sobchack describes electronic culture as so free of physical gravity that it has lost the moral grav- ity that comes from valuing and protecting bodies: "Unlike cinematic representation, electronic representation by its very structure phenomenologically diffuses the fleshly presence of the human body and the dimensions of that body's material world [...]. The electronic tends to marginalize or trivialize the human body. Indeed, at this his- torical moment in our particular society and culture, we can see all around us that the lived body is in crisis" (161). Mamoru Oshii's anime film Ghost in the Shell (which inspired the Wachowski brothers' The Matrix) and its sequel Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence are famous for their depictions of virtual worlds networked with postmodern urban spaces and cyborg bodies. In the future worlds of these films, almost all humans have some kind of non- biological implants, and people's bodies range from nearly organic to completely inor- ganic and are sometimes the property of government institutions or corporations. In these and other films of his, Oshii often includes birds and dogs that seem almost incongruous (particularly the dogs) in the crowded postmodern landscape. The birds</page><page sequence="3">Patricia E. Chu 8 1 appear in the spaces above and among the networks, streets, skyscrapers, and air trans- port vehicles that seem to have taken over any "natural space," appearing as the only true wildlife. This effect is highlighted in Innocence , where air transport is designed to look like birds and insects and the submarines to look and move like marine mammals. Oshiťs association of the animal with the postmodern cyborg can be understood as part of the series of cultural logics Donna Haraway (after whom Oshiťs cyborg philosopher-coroner in Innocence is named) analyzed in her famous essay "A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century." Haraway argued for the cyborg as a heuristic figure for political action in the late twentieth century. With its fusion of things that were not supposed to be together (machine and organic organisms, male and female, private and public, etc.), the cyborg challenged the boundaries, categories, and epistemologies on which domination was based. The cyborg could be used as "a fiction mapping our social and bodily reality and as an imaginative resource" that would produce theories to which Foucaulťs biopoli- tics were merely a "flaccid premonition" (150). In her insightful reading of the depiction of artificial animals in film and litera- ture, Ursula K. Heise points out that a little-noted part of Haraway's essay explains how challenging the boundary between human and machine should have ramifications for other formerly reliable categorical distinctions, such as human and animal. Like Sobchack, Heise identifies the provocation for such consideration as a bodily crisis: the extinction of naturally occurring animal species demands an evaluation of the "signif- icance of the natural in an increasingly technologized environment" (61). Indeed, in the same year that Heise published this essay, and nearly two decades after "A Cyborg Manifesto," Haraway returned to the topic with a second manifesto, The Companion Species Manifesto: Dogs , People and Significant Otherness. Directly linking this new manifesto to her previous work, Haraway explains that the concepts of the cyborg and the companion species are similar: "Cyborgs and companion species each bring together the human and non-human, the organic and technological, carbon and sili- con, freedom and structure, history and myth, the rich and the poor, the state and the subject, diversity and depletion, modernity and postmodernity, and nature and culture in unexpected ways [...]. Neither a cyborg nor a companion animal pleases the pure of heart who long for better protected species boundaries and sterilization of category deviants" (4). Nonetheless, she continues, the cyborg is really a "junior sibling" in the "much bigger, queer family of companion species" (11). Dogs and humans have co- evolved. To examine the history of their linkages, domestications, present relations, genetic alteration, labour, fantasies projected, and the nature of species difference is to access a field for theory, politics, and historiography that forbids the maintenance of traditional ontological categories by "mongrelizing" them.</page><page sequence="4">82 Mosaic 40/1 (March 2007) Oshii, too, links the cyborg and the companion species. When interviewed about Innocence , he has provided numerous variations on the idea that the cyborgs, robots, and other artificial "bodies" of his films index a loss of a material body, accompanied and perhaps disguised by an expansion of bodily senses: "With cell phones and the Internet, people's perceptions have expanded, but they're unaware of how this has made their bodies obsolete. [. . .] As humans have become more 'mind-oriented' and the environment has become more urban, some have forgotten the idea of the human body. [. . .] As far as they're concerned, the human body does not exist anymore. The reason that people of today choose to have dogs is that they're looking for a substitute to the human body" (Dream Works and Go Fish Pictures). In describing his cyborg detective, Oshii says, "The majority of Batou's body is cyborg, so he doesn't have a body anymore. But he finds his body in the dog" (qtd. in Anderson). Haraway might say that Oshii expresses her sense that the technopolitics of the cyborg has always had buried within it the idea that our understanding of the human body was reliant on the companion species: "Inhabitants of technoculture become who we are in the symbiogenetic tissues of naturecultures, in story and in fact" (17). That is to say, the narrative of finding one's body in one's dog as well as the chilling desire of the Locus Solus clients for sexual service androids with real ghosts is a new mobilization of a familiar genre of animal story. Like Sobchack and Haraway, N. Katherine Hayles understands contemporary cul- ture as defined by issues of (dis) embodiment and changing apprehensions of subjec- tivity driven by technological change. The contemporary "posthuman" era is one in which "information [has] lost its body" - the material that carries the information is now irrelevant. Information can be transferred from substrate to substrate unchanged. Consciousness is an informational pattern and thus, the body no longer has an intrin- sic relationship to the self. This philosophically reinforces what has always been an assumption of liberal humanism: the mind, not the body, is the anchor of true subjec- tivity. Posthumanism differs, however, from liberal humanism because of the ways in which cybernetic technology has established a view of "human being as a set of infor- mational processes" (2-5). Sobchack, Haraway, and Hayles are all aware of how attractive freedom from the constraints of time and space (not least, from pain and mortality) seems. As well, they are sympathetic to the dream of universal access to information and experiences. At the same time, all three also cast the devaluation of bodies as dangerous. Loss of a general sense of intersubjectivity, lack of attendance to social problems with bodily consequences such as disease, war, poverty, racism, and differential access to the means of disembodiment are a few of the problems to which they seek to draw our attention and with which the cultural productions they study grapple.</page><page sequence="5">Patricia E. Chu 83 The track that leads from the cultural histories Sobchack, Haraway, and Hayles describe to the animal story emerges from the idea of the body in crisis. The animal has been consistently philosophically necessary for articulating the ideal of bodily transcendence that founds the concept of humanity. In numerous and commonplace ways, traditional Western understandings of the animal1 define its animality in terms of its inability to transcend embodiment: animals may lack sentience, consciousness, a soul, subjectivity, or rationality. This categorical embodiment naturalizes the treat- ment of animals primarily as bodies: meat, materials, commodities, labour, experi- mental subjects, breeders, transplant organ producers, and so on. The dramatic cyberpunk dismissal of the human body as mere "meat" leads us instructively back to works in which animals, sometimes as fields for reconsidering the boundaries of "humanity," sometimes as an index of the restorative authenticity and "moral gravity" of embodied life, become necessary adjuncts to understanding, questioning, or ame- liorating human disembodiment. When that Roosevelt is, of lying and about Burroughs or being attacked ignorant Jack of how London animals for "really" being a behaved "nature-faker," in the that is, of lying about or being ignorant of how animals "really" behaved in the wild, they improperly classed Call of the Wild and White Fang with a type of American animal story that was neither documentary natural history nor the nature essay of Thoreau or Emerson. Writers, many of them well-known and well-established, occu- pied the major American journals at the turn of the century with invented accounts of animal actions in which animals demonstrated complex moral or sentimental thought and action. Different from the animal fable or allegory of previous eras, these tales attempted to re-establish humanity in the face of evolutionary theory. Humans might be mere animals, but animal actions could be realistically documented in terms of the "higher" emotions (see Lioi; Mighetto). London, though also responding to evolutionary theory, was after different game. He does not highlight the possible similarity between humans and animals with grim pleasure, horrified rejection, or scientific interest. Even his treatment of the animal as "other" to man is not invested in the difference between human and animal. Rather, his investment is in the animal as an avenue for expressing what could be even the subjective difference between human subjects moving through space and time. I will begin with London's treatment of the human hand. Despite the fact that the hand may be humanity's most métonymie limb, London does not treat it as the boundary between man and animal. Short of ammunition and travelling by dogsled, Henry and Bill become the tar- gets of a pack of wolves. The pack begins to bring down their team one by one, and</page><page sequence="6">84 Mosaic 40/1 (March 2007) kills Bill when he makes the mistake of leaving the sled. It seems more and more like- ly that Henry will not reach Fort McCurry, and he begins to think about how, to the wolves, "this wonderful body of his, this living flesh, was no more than so much meat": He watched his moving muscles and was interested in the cunning mechanism of his fin- gers. [. . .] He crooked his fingers slowly and repeatedly, now one at a time, now all together, spreading them wide or making quick, gripping movements. He studied the nail formation, and prodded the fingertips, now sharply, and again softly, gauging the while the nerve sensations produced. [. . .] He grew suddenly fond of this subtle flesh of his that worked so beautifully and smoothly and delicately. [. . .] He glanced at the hand that held the brand, noticing the cunning delicacy of the fingers that gripped it, how they adjusted themselves to all the inequalities of the surface [. . .] one little finger, too close to the burn- ing portion [. . .] sensitively and automatically writhing back from the hurtful heat to the cooler gripping place Never had he been so fond of this body of his [. . ( Call 126) Henry values his entire body, but finds its difference from meat specifically in his hand, that part of the human body perhaps most often depicted as marking and con- stituting the barrier between animal and human, the body part that allows and accom- plishes many of the "higher" functions: manipulation, invention, communication, fine art, domination. The shock of becoming meat is greatest when he examines the mech- anism and potential of his hand: beautiful, cunning, delicate, subtle, sensitive. The "cunning delicacy" of Henry's hand bespeaks both a more complicated material order within the hand itself, as well as Henry's capacity to appreciate this complex order. Henry can hardly believe that some gulf between humans and animals will not gape open to save him because he has a hand. And indeed, rather than allowing Henry to become meat, London steps in with men from the fort in time to save Henry. Then he executes an almost filmic cut away from a human protagonist to an animal one: "And even as they eased him down on upon the blankets his snores were rising on the frosty air. But there was another sound. Far and faint it was, in the remote distance, the cry of the hungry wolf-pack as it took the trail of other meat than the man it had just missed" (131). This is a cinematic move not because it is a "cut" from one "point of view" to another, but because the point is to make a perceptual leap into another consciousness in a way that highlights not sim- ply a different perspective on an objective world (since the photograph and earlier prose narrative have done this before) but to emphasize instead the subjective nature of experience. Sobchack argues that despite its use in film theory, the term "point of view" is inappropriate for film, because "there is no such abstraction as point of view in the cinema. Rather, there are concrete situations of viewing - specific, mobile, and invested engagements of embodied, enworlded, and situated subjects/objects" (150).</page><page sequence="7">Patricia E. Chu 85 London's use of animal subjectivity allows him to emphasize in prose this difference between point of view and viewing situation initiated by the rise of cinematic culture and to consider its implications. The next time we see the hand, it is from the wolf-dog's situation of viewing. White Fang, too, finds hands to be cunning (though by no means subtle) instruments. By this time, too, he has been beaten more than once by Gray Beaver: "He did not like the hands of the man-animals. [. . .] Sometimes they gave meat, but more often they gave hurt. [. . .] They hurled stones, wielded sticks and clubs and whips, administered slaps and clouts, and, when they touched him, were cunning to hurt with pinch and twist and wrench. [. . .] [H]e had encountered the hands of the children and learned that they were cruel ... he had once nearly had an eye poked out by a toddling papoose. [. . .] [He] became suspicious of all children. [. . .] When they came near with their ominous hands, he got up" (198-99). Where London's first account of the human hand makes a (self-conscious) narcissistic circuit, in which a man abstracts his own body to gaze at his humanity, the wolf's eye view of the hand simply lists its material functions in terms of White Fang's experiences. Where Henry sees the hand as métonymie, White Fang sees hands as almost detached from their bearers - it is as if the children carry weapons. He dislikes the "hands of the man-animals" rather than the man-animals themselves. The description is similar to the ways in which animals in White Fang catalogue each other's capacities - the difficulties of approaching a por- cupine because of the way it flicks its tail, for instance. In juxtaposing these viewing situations of the hand, London emphasizes what Sobchack describes as cinematic logic's most significant alteration to cultural con- sciousness: being able to see ourselves seeing through the eyes of others and appre- hending "oneself and others as always both viewing subjects and visible objects": [T]he cinema mechanically projected and made visible for the very first time not just the objective world but the very structure and process of subjective, embodied vision [. . .]. [Before cinema] we understood the vision of others as structured similarly to our own only through looking at - not through - the intentional light in their eyes and the investments of their objective behavior. The cinema, however, uniquely materialized this visual reflex- ivity and philosophical turning directly [. . .] we not only looked at but also looked through [. . .]. The cinema provided [. . .] objective insight into the subjective structure of vision and thus into oneself and others as always both viewing subjects and visible objects. (149) This "objective insight into the subjective structure of vision" is also significant because, in its reliance on the visible, that is, the perception of a material body, it "affirms and shows us that, sharing the materiality and the world through vision and action, we are intersubjective beings" (161).</page><page sequence="8">86 Mosaic 40/1 (March 2007) London's new anthropomorphism is cinematic (and modernizing) in this sense. Unlike earlier "animal-eye views" such as Anna Sewall's Black Beauty ; London's anthropomorphism does not emphasize the similarity of humans and animals (in Sewall's case, for didactic purposes). Rather, the point of animal subjectivity as he describes it is precisely its "otherness." London uses the animal story to make objec- tively available (as Sobchack argues cinema does) the idea of the modern intersubjec- tive. Thus, it is important to read London's essay "The Other Animals," his reply to Roosevelt's and Burroughs's charge of "nature faking" in White Fang and The Call of the Wild, not as simply a "factual" version of the novels it defends, but for what it highlights about London's novelistic version of "animal reason." In this essay, London makes it clear that Burroughs's mistake about animals lies precisely in his inability to have a modern (that is, intersubjective) aesthetic of looking "through" as well as "at." London writes that Burroughs's inability to see what animals do as reasoning is fault of his "mediaeval" "ego." According to London, for Burroughs, the "naturalist" and the "psychologist" are utterly separate: "When Darwin concluded that animals were capa- ble of reasoning in a rudimentary way, Mr. Burroughs laid him out [. . .] by saying 'But Darwin was also a much greater naturalist than psychologist.' [. . .] To him [Burroughs] affinity and kinship with the other animals is a repugnant thing. [. . .] He is too glo- rious a personality not to have between him and the other animals a vast and impass- able gulf. The cause of Mr. Burroughs's mediaeval view of the other animals is to be found, not in his knowledge of those other animals, but in the suggestion of his self- exalted ego" ("Other" 104). The modern view is one of decentred vision rather than that of "glorious personality." Sobchack writes that "the cinema functions mechani- cally to bring to visibility the reversible structure of human vision: this structure emerges in the lived body as systematically both a subject and an object, as both visu- al (seeing) and visible (seen)" (150). London contrasts himself to Burroughs in almost these terms - in the examples he gives of playing with his dogs Rollo and Glen, the naturalist (who sees) must perforce join the psychologist (who can imagine that the dog sees him). In these games, the "reasoning" of the dogs also involves their imagin- ing a human looking at them. Thus, they look "through" as well as "at." In his games with Rollo, the loser of the game was the one "fooled." London had to be able to imag- ine Rollo seeing him seeing someone else. This is not to say that such tricks could not have occurred before the advent of cinema, but rather to emphasize that London understands them in this fashion. Burroughs cannot and thus, Burroughs cannot rec- ognize animal reason or understand the aesthetics of London's novel: "Making believe that my eyes had been attracted by a moving form, I said coldly [. . .] 'No, my father is not at home.' Like a shot, Rollo was out the door. [. . .] He came back sheepishly to</page><page sequence="9">Patricia E Chu 87 endure the laugh and resume the game" (100). In the novel, these layers of the cine- matic are what form White Fang s very self: "He was regarded as the most fearful of wild beasts, and this was borne into him through the bars of the cage. Every word, every cautious action, on the part of the men, impressed upon him his own terrible ferocity. It was so much added fuel to the flame of his fierceness. There could be but one result, and that was that his ferocity fed upon itself and increased" (229). Here again we see that London's interest is not in the animal as such. He is not interested in the animal as man or in the man as animal. If White Fang parallels the escaped convict Jim Hall, who was also "soft clay" moulded into ferocity, the point is not merely to pro- duce the social Darwinian "beast," but also to understand the production of that beast, whether animal or human, in terms of visual culture and subjectivity. The point of London s modern animal story is not the animal at all, and yet the animal is absolutely necessary because it represents a different subjectivity. Sobchack writes of the subject cinematic culture produces that it is not quite human: "as is the case with human beings, this cinematic subject's potential motility and experience exist as both open-ended and inextricably bound by the existential finitude and material limits of its particular vision and historical and cultural coherence, that is, its narra- tive" (148, emph. mine). To have characteristics "as is the case with human beings" is pointedly not to be identical with a human being. Sobchack's cinematic subject reveals the human subject precisely by offering something like its "case." London's animal story similarly uses evolutionary theory's proffer of the animal that is not human, but who might act "as is the case with human beings," as an anthropomorphic technology for articulating the cultural logic of modern (inter) subjectivity. Into ("We the cry lengthy for the bird meditations but not for on the dolls, blood cyborgs, of the humans, fish"), sentience, hierarchies and of anti-human- animal life ("We cry for the bird but not for the blood of the fish"), sentience, and anti-human- ist forms of humanity, Oshii inserts Batou's dog, a basset hound, as the magnetic north around which the film's moral compass eventually orients. This is particularly notice- able because the two little girls in the film, Togusa's daughter and the one victim they are able to save, are both deliberately rejected as moral trump cards. In choosing the animal, and deliberately downplaying the "cuteness"2 of the girls, Oshii attempts a non-reactionary response to the "crisis of the flesh" Sobchack and Hayles describe, and this may be why his salute to Haraway appears. To sacralize the "authentic" human body, particularly the heterosexually-produced child, would be to reject the very explo- ration of otherness that Haraway insists on when she criticizes the way dogs are con- ceived of as "furry children." In such a project, it would be very easy to slide into what Haraway considers neurosis and narcissism: "If the idea that man makes himself by realizing his intentions in his tools, such as domestic animals (dogs) and computers</page><page sequence="10">88 Mosaic 40/1 (March 2007) (cyborgs), is evidence of a neurosis that I call humanist technophiliac narcissism, then the superficially opposed idea that dogs restore human beings' souls by their uncondi- tional love might be the neurosis of caninophiliac narcissism" (33). Oshii, as we shall see, attempts similarly to recognize many kinds of ghosts and "mongrelized" bodies. Batou does not need to restore his soul. A dog is another way to have a body, and Batou is more able than Togusa to recognize "ghosts" outside of standard embodiment. Innocence falls roughly in the genre of the police procedural, though, as I described above, set in a future where the government "owns" all but the ghosts of some of the detectives and most of the rest are cybernetic in some way. Batou, cyborg detective in Section 9, finds himself paired with the one almost wholly organic (he has an e-brain) detective, Togusa. The major's previous partner, the Major, also a cyborg, voluntarily disembodied and disappeared into the Net at the end of Ghost in the Shell The byplay among the Section 9 detectives suggests a dual dynamic of what must be proven on the job in the near future: both professionalism (Togusa, as the sole non-cyborg, often expresses anxiety about his qualifications) and humanity, that is, proving one s ghost is real. Togusa gets priority when he needs to get home for his daughter's birthday; Batou's colleagues break into his house to bring him his dog when he is unexpectedly hospitalized. In one long and nearly lyrical sequence, we see Batou at home receiving the warm and sloppy attentions of a dog that obviously considers him "real," and later learn from an exasperated colleague that despite being a single detective, Batou has deliberately chosen a dog that needs more attention than other breeds. "A single man in this line of work keeping a dog is preposterous! And of all dogs you choose a high- maintenance hound." Rather than contrasting Batou and Togusa with each other merely on the job, Oshii focuses on two particular relationships they have: Batou has a basset hound (cloned) and Togusa a young daughter. Neither has a name. Togusa's actions and his reactions on the job consistently and stereotypically refer back to the idea that he is a father and more vulnerable than a cyborg. Batou endangers himself by breaking Section 9 rules on keeping his routine irregular in order to bring his dog the food he thinks it likes best each evening. Batou and Togusa's investigation leads them to Locus Solus, a company that is "ghost dubbing": copying the girls' "ghosts" and implanting them into androids (gynoids) kept for sexual service. The process kills the girls' bodies. The presence of a real ghost makes these androids unlike any others the clients could obtain. After Batou, Togusa, and the Major (part of her consciousness temporarily uploaded to an android body) have successfully found and stopped the corporation Locus Solus, Batou finds he is in time to save a young girl whose photo he found at one of the crime scenes. He and the Major learn from her that a company official decided to bring Locus</page><page sequence="11">Patricia E. Chu 89 Solus to the attention of the police by having the gynoids "cause problems," that is to say, commit suicide or murder, and suffer while doing so. The little girl turns petulant when Batou recoils at this disregard for the feelings of the dolls/androids, calling them "victims" as well. Drawn with a marked lack of childlike attractiveness, the girl is clearly petulant because she is not the only victim, and this makes her frightened grasping at Batou seem illegitimately demanding of affection. Because of this, the fact that Batou noticeably does not physically or emotionally comfort her does not seem out of place. Moreover, Oshii reframes the second half of the discussion of this "discovery of the nature of the crime" scene to include only medium shots of Batou and the android body the Major is occupying. Unlike a more common plot in which a person, usually a man, but sometimes a too-tough career woman, must access the true centre of human experience by becoming open to wanting or at least liking children, this is not necessary to Batou's "humanity." True humanity is not linked to reproducing or privi- leging the capacity to reproduce biologically. At the end of the film, Togusa and Batou speak to each other with their respec- tive dependents (and in Togusa's case also a doll he has purchased for his daughter) in their arms. Batou is picking up his dog from Togusa's family. Togusa urges Batou to come in; he declines, saying simply that he does not like to hang out with other peo- ple's families. Batou softens his rejection of Togusa's invitation by "finding his body" - he grabs the dog's paw and waves "goodbye" to them. Behind Togusa there is an old- fashioned single-family house with lights spilling out of the windows. Behind Batou, the lights and buildings of the city skyline stand out. Typically, such an opposition would suggest support for traditional organic embodiment and natural reproduction over Batou's artificiality and ersatz "family." This is not the case, however. Togusa's choice of a souvenir to bring his daughter, a doll, is bizarrely inappropriate, given the case the men have just worked, and one of the final shots is an ominous close-up of the doll's face, not of the girl's. It harks back, too, to the coroner Haraway's sardonic comment to the men when Togusa calls "absurd" her suggestion that the suicides of gynoids, often simply turned into the street when new models come out, are "protests against their own obsolescence": "Humans are different from robots. That's an article of faith, like black is different from white. It's no more helpful than the basic fact that humans aren't machines. Unlike industrial robots, the androids and gynoids designed as 'pets,' weren't designed along utilitarian or practical methods. Instead we model them on a human image and an idealized one at that. Why are humans so obsessed with recreating themselves?"3 Children, she continues, are clearly not human, since they are excluded from standards for human behaviour: "Raising children is the easi- est way to create artificial life." In other words, Oshii reminds us at the end of the film that the case started with a radical separation of artificial humanity from "authentic"</page><page sequence="12">90 Mosaic 40/1 (March 2007) humanity. The traditional nuclear family home is not a "natural" refuge from the postmodern networked city, but clings ignorantly to obsolete fetishizations of "humanity" that allowed Locus Solus to profit from "ghost dubbing." Batou's (cloned) dog has the last frame and "word," whining expressively and incredulously after the shot of the doll to mark the film's acceptance of the postmodern urban artificial repli- cated body as having as authentic a ghost as the head of a nuclear family generated by traditional organic heterosexual reproduction. As Christopher Bolton has argued in his analysis of the mecha in anime, Oshii has in a previous film made a point of creating a "cinematic," that is, embodied and subjective position, within the "no-body" of the "electronic" medium of anime, allow- ing him to posit the existence of an unmediated human subject despite the intense digitization, disembodiment, and despatialization of contemporary life. In another of the interviews in which Oshii explains the themes of Innocence in terms of an animal, he develops this idea of finding a centred, recognizable, and uniquely human subjec- tivity rather than a "presence" dispersed on the Net. Oshii describes the loss of his own pet here: "A few years ago, I had a shock when my cat Nene died. There was a hole in my heart, a hole that could not be filled, even though a new cat, Mina, came along. I started to wonder why. Why can't one cat replace another? And I started to think that the T' is not just one person, but the sum of everything you love - your dog, your wife, your child, your computer, your doll. This led me to the conclusion that the self is empty. What is essential is this network of connections" (Mann). This quote is about humanizing, that is, anthropomorphizing, Oshii, not Nene. He does not describe Nene's special qualities. In fact, Oshii describes his train of thought as beginning with surprise that Nene was not replaceable. This surprise is understandable, Sobchack might say, given that "the electronic semiotically - and significantly - constitutes a system of sim- ulation , a system that constitutes copies that seem lacking an original ground" (154). If everything is a copy, Mina should certainly be able to replace Nene, for there was no ethical investment in Nene's actual material existence. In the digital world, Nene and the experience of having Nene are both merely "information" to be "selected, com- bined and instantly replayed and rerun" (Sobchack 155). Oshii does not contradict Sobchack's characterization of the electronic era so much as he finds a place for a kind of human body and humanity within it. Like Sobchack, he assumes that the idea of the old self, the stable and distinguishable "I," the accumulating "centered and subjec- tive spatiotemporal engagement with materiality of the world and others" is gone. Nonetheless, he maintains that Nene's stubborn irreplaceability left a hole in his heart. In other words, human subjectivity can be reassembled and regrounded within the networks that Sobchack describes as "dispersing" it - with the help of animal bodies.</page><page sequence="13">Patricia E. Chu 9 1 In the future, when Mina dies, she can perform the same function as Nene - to attrib- ute human characteristics and qualities to her "electronic" owner. Oshii is trying to imagine an embodied electronic existence in which interchangeability is not possible, that is, an existence in which there is a moral grounding. Animals, that is, pets, are key to this idea. But they do not appear as anthropomorphized themselves, rather, they remain what they are. Innocence is not, strictly speaking, an animal story. But in its use of animals to solve a crisis of the flesh brought on by the cyborg, the electronic, and the posthuman, it is extraordinarily revealing of how theories of those concepts help us to reinterpret our idea of the modern animal and narrative. When sense Jack of deliberately London depicted being unscientific animal reasoning, when he he should was not have "nature-faking" been expected in to the be sense of deliberately being unscientific when he should have been expected to be scientific (he was a fiction writer, not a scientist) nor did he attribute the kinds of sen- timental feelings to his animals that the actual nature-fakers did. The new evolution- ary animal did not disturb his ability to produce narrative. Indeed, as Sobchack puts it, one can understand the cinematic subject in terms of narrative potential. The new cinematic subject "is perceived [. . .] as able to inscribe visual and bodily changes of situation, to dream, hallucinate, imagine, remember, and value its habitation and experience of the world" (148). Robert T. Bakker, on the other hand, wrote his novel, Raptor Red, from the point of view of the animal in the electronic era and about a real animal that is not quite real - the dinosaur. The dinosaur is both prehistoric and historic. As W.J.T. Mitchell has discussed at length in The Last Dinosaur Booky there were, conceptually speaking, no dinosaurs as animals before the nineteenth century and there are clearly identifiable peaks in cul- tural fascination with dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are the most primitive of animals as well as the most (post)modern. They are real, yet also "fictional." The prehistoric animal, as James M. Moran points out, is nearly inevitably "relegated" to science fiction for the simple reason that "extinct, its remains [lie] nearly beyond the codes of representation themselves," highlighting how, "like fiction, science often works in the conditional mode" (259). Paleontologists endeavour to "embody" the fossilized bones they unearth by producing scientifically logical hypotheses from these fossils about how dinosaurs metabolized, were muscled, coated, stood, moved, and behaved. At the same time, the dinosaur is the exemplary electronic animal. Its body always already "dispersed," its bones scattered so that it can take years to figure out how to reassemble them, it is also endlessly digitized and copied as a whole animal into the present moment, defying all spatial and temporal constraints in the manner of Sobchacks electronic subject. In his Preface, Bakker makes much of the fact that the giant raptor Spielberg invented was</page><page sequence="14">92 Mosaic 40/1 (March 2007) "found" before the film was released. But Spielberg would have created it whether or not someone found "Spielberg's raptor." When Bakker, a professional paleontologist whose primary publications about ani- mals appear in scientific journals or as academic books, wrote Raptor Red from the standpoint of a feisty female Utahraptor ; reviewers drew clear lines between "scientific" and "anthropomorphic" animals. While not quite the accusations of "nature-faking" that Jack London faced, Bakker's "anthropomorphism" was notable because of his sci- entific standing. In Scientific American , David Norman commented "Such anthro- pocentricity was trite even in the Disney movies; it is downright painful to see it in a book [. . .] written by an author who is credited as 'one of the world's foremost pale- ontologists'" (108). Reviewers David Chiszar and Hobart M. Smith, expressed the same surprise. "Bakker is a skilled scientist [. . .] familiar with the behavioral litera- ture, and [. . .] certain to understand that the majority of anthropologists, psycholo- gists and biologists will cringe" (397). Raptor Red is extraordinarily anthropomorphic. Bakker even describes a dinosaur as being "aware of his own death," when one of the traditional philosophical distinctions between animals and humans (however vexed) is that animals do not comprehend their own deaths (Lippit 11). But what these and other reviewers did not comment on was Bakker's use of the terms of molecular genetics and cybernetics - the animal as both information processor and product of code-script information. As a chick learning her family members, Raptor Red takes her first breath of air: "That first invasion of air- borne particles traveled down her nostril tubes and into the olfactory chambers built into her skull, right in front of her eyes. [. . .] Biochemical detector cells were galvanized into action as soon as the particles dissolved in the thin mucous lining. Electrical discharges, a thousand each millisecond, lit up the nerve pathways leading from the olfactory chamber to the massive olfactory stalk of her brain" (20). He also uses the language of computer systems. While hunting, Raptor Red "locks on," makes calcula- tions with the help of her "automatic prey-evaluation computer," and changes her "visual mode" "from wide-scan search to monofocus" (130). Here, as Hayles writes in her discussion of early developments in cybernetic theory, subjectivity is imagined such that "a human organism [or any organism?] becomes, in effect, a sort of perme- able membrane through which hormonal information flows." In this paradigm, she continues, "personal identity and autonomous will are merely illusions that mask the cybernetic reality," making possible sex without sexuality (109). To return to Sobchack's paradigm, the move to the electronic subject, the information processing subject, is to lose precisely the cinematic body/narrative. Thus, we might read Bakker as in some way more of a nature-faker than London, insofar as he, like the nature-fakers, wants to restore something lost with the advent of an evolutionary animal. But we can also</page><page sequence="15">Patricia E. Chu 93 read Bakker's turn to the animal story, again, in Sobchack's terms, as an attempt to make visible and possible the paradox of an electronic subjectivity. Bakker at one point seems to admit that the latest paradigms of molecular biology or cybernetic views of life make his narrative impossible. "Genes can t plan a strategy. Genes cant think, cant feel, cant mourn the loss of a loved one [. . .] can't bite, can't bleed, can't feel pain. Genes are tiny pixels of inheritance, devoid of feeling" (134). Sobchack's dispersed subject, one that "co-heres" rather than "coheres," and Hayles's new narrator (one that draws authority from high-tech language rather than from physical participation in a community) share the same kind of paradoxical exis- tence as Bakker's anthropomorphic-cybernetic dinosaur (Sobchack 156; Hayles 45-46). That is, it is paradoxical if, as Hayles puts it, molecular biology and the idea of DNA code-script have indeed convinced us that consciousness is merely an epiphe- nomenon of evolution (2-3). Like Roosevelt and Burroughs, we would have to reject storied animals. But Stephanie S. Turner, in a discussion of cloning metaphors and narrative, has suggested that "the surplus of meaning surrounding DNA" has, in ways that reflect a capitalist bioinformatics economy, allowed for the "negotiation of the telos of DNA" (903-904). Richard L. Doyle writes that: "A researcher will begin with the end of narrativity, with the idea that 'all there is' to know about an organism can be found in its electronic database sequence [...]. But she will not stop there; the nar- rative of life will now be an exegetical one, where theorists scan databases [. . .] and produce new knowledge, new stories of organisms" (qtd. in Turner 899). Animals, cloned, created, artificial, and companion, are part of this beginning. And thus, some- how, Raptor Red "does think and feel and weigh the conflicting demands of her young consort and her sister" (134). NOTES 1/ Oshii's direct references to Western texts mean that his work cannot be considered purely "non- Western." See also Kumiko Sato, "How Information Technology Has (Not) Changed Feminism and Japanism: Cyberpunk in the Japanese Context," Comparative Literature Studies 41.3 (2004), 335-55 on Japan's particular relationship to cyberpunk. 2/ Innocence is realistic in style, so one would not expect the exaggerated versions of neoteny that migrated to anime from manga styling. However, the little girl victim especially is depicted so without "kawaii" as to look almost angular and ugly in the context of the usual appearance of even non-comedic feature film young girls in anime. 3/ Quotations from the film are from the English subtitles.
