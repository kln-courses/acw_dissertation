<plain_text><page sequence="1">McNAMARA'S TARGUM AND TESTAMENT * THE AUTHOR, FATHER MCNAMARA, already well-known for his scholarly contributions to the area of Targumic studies, offers here a useful "reference" study in Targum, Rabbinic literature, and New Testament. The work, minus the traditional preface and introduction, immediately plunges into an opening summary of the literature involved, namely, "ancient Jewish writings," covering the Jewish Apocalyptic literature, the Dead Sea Scrolls, Rabbinic Literature, and what he calls the literature of "Liturgical Judaism," the latter referring specifically to the Palestinian Targum and the New Testament, as well as to their interrelationship. The work itself is divided into two parts followed by an appendix. Part I describes the "formation of the Targumic tradi- tion," Part II deals with the Palestinian Targum and New Testament Studies, while the Appendix, in addition to defining the other extant Targums aside from the Palestinian Targum, also offers an alphabet- ical index of the place names in Neofiti entitled "Geography of Neofiti." Father McNamara's expertise in N.T. studies is indisputable and his involvement in the Targumic field is very extensive. However, his remarks throughout this work on Rabbinic literature and on related Jewish traditions are not always accurate, especially since these form an integral part of Targumic studies. Consequently, they require close scrutiny and checking with the primary sources in each case. His statement concerning the preservation of the Baraita, "the Tosephta ... is a work in which this second class of material is pie- served," leaves the impression that the Tosefta is the only source for the Baraita, since no mention is subsequently made of the Gemara. Yet on the very next page, in describing the Gemara, he mentions it as containing "a host of Baraita." On page 9 the remark is made that "the Mishnah makes no attempt to base its laws on the Bible." Obviously Father McNamara is not acquainted with S. Rosenblatt's The Interpretation of the Bible in the Mishnah (Baltimore I935), which has recently been followed by that same author's The Interpretation of the Bible in the Tosefta (Jewish Quarterly Review Monograph Series, 4) (Philadelphia, I974).

As a matter of fact, the dating of the various Targumim is intricately bound up with that of Rabbinic texts, no simple matter in itself since there late texts may contain early traditions. His description of the Pharisees (p. 26) to the effect that "they differed from the Scribes in that they were not of the learned class," is most unfortunate, and flies in the face of every theory concerning the Pharisees and their theological personality. There appears to be no limit to Father McNamara's tendency to give an early date of composition to the Palestinian Targum. In his discussion of the Shemac, he says (p. 4o), "synagogue liturgy apparently affected the Palestinian Targum rendering, ... It is likewise a further argument for the venerable age of the former." I fail to see the basis for this type of reasoning when no established date for the synagogue liturgy exists, and when the influence may just as well have worked the other way. On the topic of synagogue liturgy, his statement concerning the Eighteen Benedictions (pp. 40-4I), "in the synagogue service for Sabbaths and festivals, however, only the first three and the last three ... were recited," must be set straight. An additional blessing appropriate to the occasion of the Sabbath or of the relevant festival is inserted during those days (cf. Elie Munk, The World of Prayer [New York 1963], II, io). In the section "The Dating of Jewish Traditions" (p. 89), Father McNamara cites Paul's statement in I Cor. IO:4 about a rock which followed the Israelites during their desert wanderings. He states that this tradition is not found in the Old Testament and goes on to say, "there is on the contrary, a well- attested Jewish tradition on the well, in rock form, which followed the Israelites in the desert." What "on the contrary" refers to, I do not know. Furthermore, would it not have been helpful to cite this "well-attested Jewish tradition" as that of R. Jose in the Babylonian Talmud (B. Tacan. 9a) ? In discussing the reverential attitude in speaking about God that is evident in the Targumim (p. 93), Father McNamara mentions, among several examples, Exod. 2:25, where he renders the Hebrew as "God saw the people of Israel and God saw their condition." What precisely in the Hebrew text does "and God saw their condition" translate ? He then cites a Targumic rendering of this part of the verse (presum- ably that of Neofiti), "the servitude (yt ?cbd) of the sons of Israel was manifest before the Lord," as illustrating the point he had made II8</page><page sequence="3">MC NAMARA'S TARGUM AND TESTAMENT-GROSSFELD II9 earlier, that the Targumists, in shying away from making the Deity the direct subject or object of an action, turn active verbs in the Hebrew Biblical text into passive verbs in the Targum, "sometimes with a certain amount of violence being done to the Aramaic language." It just so happens that Neofiti's rendering of Exod. 2:25 has parallels in Rabbinic literature (cf. Leqah Tob, ad loc., tla"1V fHl). In his discussion of anthropomorphism in the Targum, Father McNamara says (p. o00) that the insertion of "Shekinah" in the expression the "Glory of the Shekinah of the Lord" in the Palestinian Targum "may be a further attempt to remove any trace of anthro- pomorphism." Maybe so, but perhaps we have here a mere conflation of two Targumic variants, one of which read "the Glory of the Lord" and the other "the Shekinah of the Lord," not an unusual situation in the Palestinian Targum. For example, in Exod. I6:7, also cited by Father McNamara, where Neofiti has '"'1 I~nr1tl ' , we find TO rendering ';TH RP", while in Exod. 19:17 Neofiti's Xn1t 'lR" '"'r may be contrasted with '11 1 RlVn in Ps.-Jon., and Ms. F of the Cairo Geniza PT fragments, '"7 nrP1 . If Father McNamara means to say that the PT to the Pentateuch is the only Targum where we find "the designation of God as 'Father in heaven' " (p. II6), he should confer the Targum Rishon to Esther 5:I4. The section entitled "Geography of Neofiti" (pp. I90-205) would have been more useful had it been arranged in the Hebrew alphabetical order. As it stands, it is confusing and at times even inconsistent. For instance, the "interpretative renderings," except for Zuzim, contain no Rabbinic references at all. Finally, Father McNamara's reasoning that the Hagiographa did not form part of the synagogue liturgy, and that therefore "no Aramaic rendering was then required for synagogue use," needs to be corrected, since the Five Megilloth were employed in the worship service from very early times (Esther on Purim, Canticles on Passover, Ruth on Pentecost, Lamentations on the Ninth of Ab, and Ecclasiastes on Tabernacles). It therefore stands to reason that the Targumim to the Five Megilloth were also officially required for synagogue use. University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee BERNARD GROSSFELD</page></plain_text>
