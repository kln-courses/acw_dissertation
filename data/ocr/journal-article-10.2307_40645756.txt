<plain_text><page sequence="1">KAWA V AND TAHARQO'S BYIWT: SOME ASPECTS OF NUBIAN ROYAL IDEOLOGY By ROBERTO B. GOZZOLI A translation and commentary of Kawa V, the inundation stela of Taharqo's sixth year. An identification of the four omens in the central part of the text is provided, and the ideological relevance of the royal mother and royal sister in the Nubian concept of kingship are also studied. Stela no. V of Taharqo's year 6, mentioning the 'four wonders', was found in the forecourt of Temple T at Kawa. The inscription is the complete version of a text also partially transmitted by other copies from Tanis, Coptos, and Matanieh.1 Kawa V has a double scene (fig. i) in the lunette, under the winged sun disc 'the Behedite, the Great God, Lord of the Sky'. On the right 'Amun-Re, Lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands, Lord of the Sky' receives wine from 'the Lord of the Two Lands, hwi-nfrtm Rr, the son of Re, of his body, Taharqo, given all life like Re forever'. The king wears the so-called Kushite cap, with double uraeus on his forehead, streamers, and the ram-headed Amun amulet.2 He is followed by 'the royal mother, 1 Ny Carlsberg Glyptothek Copenhagen, AE.I.N. 171 2.

The central column contains the speech of the god.3 'Words spoken: "I have given to you life, all power, all health, all happiness, like Re forever'". The scene is mirrored on the left, with the king offering bread and his mother shaking the sistrum in front of Amun of Gematen. The lunette from Kawa differs from those from Coptos and Matanieh. Coptos has the king offering a field to a deity, whose figure is lost. The god - probably Min - is accompanied by another male deity - presumably Horus - who is followed by the complete figure of Isis. The lunette from Matanieh shows a double scene with the pharaoh offering a field to the anthropomorphic god Hemen, Lord of Hefet. The lunette of the Tanis inscription is completely missing.4 The main text has: (i)Year 6,a under the Majesty of the Horus qH-hrwy the Two Ladies qn-hrw, the Golden Horus hw-Uwy, the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, hwi-nfrtm i?rb son of Re, Taharqo,c living forever, beloved of Maat, to whom Amun has given Maat, may he live forever. As His Majesty is the one who loves the god, (2) he spends the day and lies by night seeking what is useful to the gods,d building their temples fallen into decay,e giving birth to their statues as in the primeval times/ building their storehouses, endowing (3) altars, presenting them with offerings of any product, making their offering tables of fine gold, silver, copper. Now, the heart of His Majesty is satisfied with doing what is beneficent to them every day.g This land is inundated (4) in his time as it was in the time of the Lord-of-All, every man sleeping until dawnh without saying 'Oh, would I had' at all. Maat is introduced in all the countries; Isefet is pinned to the ground.1 (5) Omens-i happened at the time of His Majesty in the sixth year of his appearance; the like thereof has not been seen since the ancient times (lit. the times of the old ones).^ Greatly his father Amun-Re loved him.1 His Majesty (6) requested the inundation from his father Amun-Re Lord of the Two Lands in order not to make the famine happen in his time.m Look, anything that comes from the mouth of His Majesty, his father Amun makes it happen immediately. As the time of the inundation (7) of the Nile came, it overflowed greatly every day and did so for many days. The inundation was of a cubit per day; it penetrated the hills of the South Land and was over the mound of the North Land.n The land was like the Nun, an inert (water), (8) the land was not discernible from the river. It overflowed for 21 cubits two and half fingers at the quay of Thebes.

Any man of Ta-Sety was inundated with everything. Egypt was in a beautiful festival, adoring His Majesty. The heart of His Majesty was happy more than anything about what (10) the father Amun had done, making endowments to be given to all the gods.q His Majesty said: 'Father Amun-Re, Lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands, made these four beautiful omens for me in one year, in the sixth year of my appearance as king/ Nothing similar had been done (11) since the times of those who were before (i.e. those of ancient times).

(13) I reaped the harvest into the granaries, the amount not known thereof, with barley of Upper and Lower Egypt, and any seed that grows on the surface of the earth. I came from Ta-Sety in the midst of the king's brothers whom His Majesty had brought together (14) from there.u I was with him; he loved me more than all his brothers, more than all his children. I was distinguished from them by His Majesty; the hearts of the £¿z£-people served me and the love of me was before all men. (15) I received the crown in Memphis after the falcon flew to heaven. v My father Amun placed all the lands and the foreign countries under my sandals; the south land to Retebu-Kabet, the south to Ka-(i6)Hehes, the east to where Re rises, the west to the place where he sets. My mother was in Ta-Sety, the king's sister full of love, king's mother Abalo, may she be given life.w Now, (17) I was far from her as a twenty year old recruit, as I went with His Majesty to the North Land.x Then she came sailing downstream to see me (18) after a long period of years. She found me after I had appeared in the throne of Horus, having accepted the crown of Re, having united the Two Ladies on my head, all the gods as protection of my body. She was extremely joyful (19) after she saw the beauty of His Majesty, just as Isis saw her son Horus appearing on the throne of (his) father Osiris, after he had been a child in the midst of the nest of Chemmis.y (20) Upper and Lower Egypt, all the foreign lands were bowing to the king's mother. They were in a very great jubilee, their great and their small ones. They shouted to the king's mother (21) saying. 'Isis, as Horus received her, was like this mother after she has joined her son, the King of Upper and Lower Egypt Taharqo, may he live forever, beloved by the gods. May you be living forever as your father Amun has ordered, (22) excellent god who loves the one who loves him, who knows who is loyal to him,2 having made your mother stay in peace, after she saw the beauty he has made for you. O powerful king, may you live, and be healthy, like the living Horus for his mother Isis. You are the one appearing on the throne of Horus forever and ever'.aa Commentary (a) See P.

There were no rebellious desert dwellers in his time, so greatly did his father Amun love him'. Anlamani's stela makes the relation between god and king explicit, as anything the king receives derives from the divine love. (i) Such ideology derived from New Kingdom models finds its earlier prologue in the monologue of the creator god (Spell 1130), A.

GOZZOLI JEA 95 rightly interprets Taharqo's byiwt under the more general heading of 'Zeichen, Omen', giving earlier examples. He also notes that one of the byiwt (Graefe, Wortfamilie bß-y 214 n. 37) can be considered as the king's coronation, making reference to Irike Ammanote's inscription (Kawa IX, col. 212), Macadam, Temples of Kawa I, 50-67 and pis 17-26; see also FH N' 1 , 400-20, and A.

Graefe's interpretation has been followed by I. Shirun-Grumach, Offenbarung, Orakel und Königsnovelle (ÄAT 24; Wiesbaden, 1993), 20-2, and M. Römer, Gottes- und Priesterherrschaft in Ägypten am Ende des Neuen Reiches: Ein religions geschichtliches Phänomen und seine sozialen Grundlagen (ÄAT 21; Wiesbaden, 1994), 148-50. Following Graefe, I prefer the neutral interpretation as omen or sign. (k) For similar passages, see also U. Luft, '"Seit der Zeit Gottes"', StudAeg 2 (1976), 58-60; U. Luft, Beiträge zur Historisierung der Götterwelt und Mythenschreibung - StudAeg 4 (1978), 155-66. (1) A similar expression can also be found in Anlamani Kawa VIII, line 21, saying: n ri mr s(w) it.j ïmn 'so greatly did his father Amun love him'. In Taharqo's Kawa V, however, god's love is part of a circularity of love, which is present in the second part of the text.

Said, The River Nile: Geology, Hydrology and Utilisation (Oxford, 1993), 152 and fig. 2.24 have observed, the Nile in the year 6 of Taharqo reached the highest level known from antiquity.

This passage let Macadam, Temples of Kawa 1,19 suggest the hypothesis of a six year coregency between Shebitqo and Taharqo. (w) Taharqo's father is not known. Nitocris' stela says that Amenirdis, Taharqo's daughter, was adopted by his sister Shepenwepet. (x) The coming of Taharqo to Egypt has been usually dated to 701 bc, with reference to the biblical mention of Taharqo at the battle of Eltekeh in 2 Kings 18-19, Isaiah 36-37, 2 Chronicles 32; see F. J. Yurco, 'Sennacherib's Third Campaign and the Coregency of Shabaka and Shebitku', Serapis 6 (1980), 222-4. The view is challenged by R. Morkot, The Black Pharaohs: Egypt's Nubian Rulers (London, 2000), 226, who prefers dating Taharqo's coming to Egypt to the late or middle 690s. The inscription of Sargon II from Tang-i Var just specifies that Shebitqo was the pharaoh involved in the battle of Eltekeh, but adds no further proof of Taharqo's participation in the battle: published by G. Frame, 'The Inscription of Sargon II at Tangi-i Var', Or 68 (1999), 31-57, and see D. B. Redford, 'A Note on the Chronology of Dynasty 25 and the Inscription of Sargon II at Tang-i Var', Or 68 (1999), 58-60; D.

Herrmann (eds), Religion und Geschichte des alten Ägypten: Gesammelte Aufsätze (Cologne, 1975), 122. (aa) As noted by Török, Image of the Ordered World, 405, the text has circularity in the narration of the events. After the initial date, the narrative mentions the king's youth (701 bc), his coronation (690 bc), with the final eulogy going back to the initial date. The Four Omens The byvuot demonstrate that Taharqo is more favoured than all the kings before him. The unprecedented inundation level is only seen in its positive aspects, in open contrast with the cry of help of Osorkon Ill's graffito of almost a century earlier. As the inundation reached levels never attested before, this extraordinary event is quoted as proof that Taharqo was loved by the god as no one before him.5 The central part of the stela is undoubtedly Taharqo's speech of lines 10-21, the description of the four byiwt, which are Taharqo's political manifesto. In his publication of Kawa V, Macadam argued that: 1. Taharqo was associated with the throne by Shebitqo since he was 20 years old; he was regent until his sixth year, when Shebitqo died and Taharqo became the sole ruler, Kawa V being the earliest text of his sole kingship. In this context the mention of Taharqo's coronation in the stela dated to year 6 should be considered. 2. The four wonders are: the inundation, the rainstorm in Nubia, Taharqo's coronation, and Abalo's visit to her son.6 In their 1952 review of Macadam's publication, Leclant and Yoyotte considered the byiwt of Kawa V to consist of good harvest, with inundation and rain not bringing any damage.7 Their interpretation depends on the rejection of Macadam's theory, and in particular Taharqo as co-regent of Shebitqo for six years.8 That Macadam was wrong in his chronological implications about Taharqo's coregency has been noted many times, but the rejection of his theory has also implied dismissal of his identification of the four omens, usually identified with the rich harvest derived from the inundation.9 Among recent studies, only Vinogradov and Assmann seem to deviate from the views 5 Cf. Gozzoli, Writing of History , 72-5. 6 Macadam, Temples of Kawa I, 18-19; and Graefe, Wortfamilie bß-, 119. 7 Leclant and Yoyotte, BIFAO 52, 23: 'L'application du ternie bin, expression de portée très générale, à des fastes de la vie agricole s'expliquerait d'autant mieux si l'an 6 du règne, marqué par une récolte abondante, suivant une inondation et une pluviosité remarquables (elles-mêmes données comme Mit: V, 5=C.[Coptos] 8-9= M.[Matanieh] 9) venait, comme on l'a supposé, après plusieurs années de Nil bas, et si, par surcroît, l'énorme cure n'a causé aucun des dégâts auxquels on aurait pu s'attendre'. 8 Leclant and Yoyotte, BIFAO 52, 24.

Kitchen, The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1100-650 BC) (2nd edn; Warminster, 1986), 388-9 says: 'In his Year 6 (c. 685 B.C.), Egypt suffered a remarkably high inundation of the Nile, exceeding even that of the 3rd year of Osorkon III nearly a century earlier; Nubia, correspondingly, had rain. Two Nile-level texts on the Karnak quay attest its extreme height. However, this apparent disaster of an over-high Nile that flooded the land was followed by blessing, according to Taharqa. Amun gave him "four wonders", a four- fold blessing, after the great flood, of good cultivation everywhere, the destruction of rodents and vermin, the warding-off of the greed of the locusts, and prevention of the south wind blighting the crops - so, in due course, Taharqo and Egypt benefited from a bumper harvest'. The same view is followed by K.-H. Priese, 'Zur Sprache der ägyptischen Inschriften der Könige von Kusch', ZÀS 98 (1972), 120; Murnane, Ancient Egyptian Coregencies , 192, as well as Török, FHN I, 157; Török, Image of the Ordered World, 404; Morkot, The Black Pharaohs, 231; Dallibor, Taharqo, 68-9.</page><page sequence="9">2OO9 KAWA V AND TAHARQO'S BYÍWT 243 of other scholars: the former highlights the importance of the rain in Nubia, and the latter the relevance of the royal mother coming to see her son.10 In identifying the list of the various byiwt, I am of the view that there is a substantial misunderstanding at the base of all these interpretations. Apart from the inundation, one other bylt is certainly the rain. Rain is sometimes described as a celestial Nile (hrpy m pt)y and is another facet of the creation.11 The special connection between inundation and rain is confirmed in other Nubian royal texts. In Taharqo's inscription from the peristyle court at Karnak, the king refers to the inundation and rain as prodigies from the god (columns 9-10): [...] hrpy rl n p(l)y.i hiw iiw n.i ti pt iw.s rd iw.s rsi [m hw] ' . . . a great inundation in my time, make the sky thick for me, abundant [with rain]'.12 Also the connection between rain and inundation as divine favour appears in the later stela of Anlamani (Kawa VIII, line 26): di.k n.i hrp(y) wr nfr m smmw hiyt rit nn snw im.f, 'Grant me a great inundation, good in harvest, a great flood without trouble in it.' And both elements are also present in the Harsiotef Annals (lines 1 1-13): dd n.i Imn Npt i-di(.i) n.k pi shw n pi ti Nhs di.i n.k pi 4 qrhw npi ti driw.f di(.i) n.k pi mw nfr di(.i) n.k pt mw hwr nfr 'Amun of Napata has said to me, "I give you the crown of the land of Nubia. I give you the four corners of the land in its entirety. I give you the good water; I give you a sky of good rain"'.13 The rain as internal divine sign continued to be exploited during the later Saite period, as on the Daphne stela.14 The same concept is repeated in Herodotus, Book III, 10: 'In the reign of his successor Psammenitus [i.e. Psammetichus III], an unparalleled event occurred - rain fell at Thebes, a thing which the men of that city say had never happened before, or has ever happened since till my day. Normally, in Upper Egypt no rain falls at all; but on this occasion it did - a light shower'.15 Since Psammetichus III is ready for the battle against Cambyses, the rain over Thebes demonstrates that Psammetichus is anointed by the god as the legitimate ruler over Egypt.16 10 Vinogradov, in Eyre (ed.), Seventh ICE Abstracts, 194-5, and J. Assmann, The Mind of Egypt (New York, 2002), 362. 11 Vikentiev, La haute crue du Nil, 51-2; A. -P. Zivie, 'Regen', LA V, 204, and A. Roccati, 'Lessico metereologico', in Junge (ed.), Studien zu Sprache, I, 345. In earlier Egyptian texts, the appearance of the rain as manifestation of divine will is confined outside the Egyptian border, see Montuhotep IV's inscription no. 191 from Wadi Hammamat: J. Couyat and P. Montet, Les inscriptions hiéroglyphiques et hiératiques du Ouâdi Hammâmât (MI FAO 34; Cairo, 19 1 2), 97-8 and pl. xxxvi; Shirun-Grumach, Offenbarung, 8-12 for transliteration and translation of the text, also mentioning earliest studies. In that instance, the rain helps the success of the royal expedition, filling the well, and giving water to the expedition force. In the Ramesses II First Marriage stela (KRI II, 233-56), the god Seth is upset with the Hittites and therefore does not make rain come (KRI II 245. 13-246. 1-3), cf. J. F. Borghouts, 'Divine Intervention in Ancient Egypt and Its Manifestation (biwY , in R. J. Demarée and J. J.

GOZZOLI JEA 95 Thus, inundation and rain are the first two omens. The other two byiwt can be established when Kawa V is considered within the group set up by Taharqo at Kawa, and Kawa IV becomes relevant in this context.17 In the historical prelude of Kawa IV, describing Taharqo visiting the temple, the prince found it completely covered by the sand.

(16) He knew the one who would have done a monument, for I am his son, whom he had engendered.18 The mothers of my mother were assigned to him (17) by their older brother, the son of Re, Alara, right of voice, saying:19 'This god who knows the one who is loyal to him, the swift one, who comes to the one who calls him, (18) may you look to the womb of my relatives for me,20 and may you establish their children on earth.

His mother's mother was assigned to him by her older brother, the Son of Re Alara, (23) right of voice, saying, 'O beneficent god, the swift one, who comes to him who calls upon him, may you look after my sister-wife for me, born with me from one womb. You acted for her as you did for him who acted for you, as an omen, unpremeditated, and not disregarded by reflective people.23 May you put a stop to him that plotted evil against me, (24) after you raised me as king. May you act for my sister likewise,24 as you honoured her children in this land.

May he be granted all life, like Re, forever. Kawa IV and VI clarify the consequences of Alara's commitment with the god. As the founder king of the dynasty, he established that his sister-wife should be consecrated to Amun.25 The Sitz in Leben situation of Alara's alliance is what is 23 Jansen, Winkeln, Or 72, 144 translates 'Mögest du für sie handeln, wie du gehandelt hast fur den, der für dich handelt, in einen Wunder, das niemand geahnt hatte und auf das nicht gebaut worden war von Vorausplanenden(?)' M. Gilula, 'Egyptian nht - Coptic nahte "To Believe'", JNES 36 (1977), 296, referring to a suggestion by K. Baer, translates: 'A wonder which was not in men's hearts and not believed in by others', in partial contradiction of Macadam's interpretation as 'A wonder unpremidated and not contrived by schemers', cf. Macadam, Temples of Kawa I, 40 nn. 84-5. L. Török, 'The Emergence of the Kingdom of Kush', CRIPEL 17 (1995), 214 and id., The Image of the Ordered World, 51 , believes that Pabatma was the royal sister mentioned here, an opinion also followed by Verhoeven, in Clarysse, Schoors, and Willems (eds), Egyptian Religion, II, 1496. 24 I here accept Clère, BiOr 8, 179 and Jansen- Winkeln's interpretation that snt also means wife, against R. Morkot, 'Kingship and Kinship in the Empire of Kush', in S. Wenig (ed.), Studien zum antiken Sudan: Akten der y. Internationalen Tagung für meroitischen Forschungen vom 14. bis ig. September 1992 in Gosen/bei Berlin (Meroitica 15; Wiesbaden, 1999), 213. 25 As noted by Jansen-Winkeln, Or 72, 152, Alara assumes the role of the founder. Török, CRIPEL 17, 214, defines the pact stipulated by Alara with Amun as the moment of the conversion of the Kurru dynasty to the Amun-Re religion.</page><page sequence="12">246 ROBERTO B. GOZZOLI JEA 95 relevant here: Alara is confirmed as king, as the oracle formally states his rights against the other candidate. But Alara also offered his own sister to be the god's priestess. Past and future are linked together by Alara's sister, perhaps Taharqo's grand- mother.26 When Alara offers his sister, as well as any future female of the Nubian royal house to the god, the god in return has to promise that her sister's descendants will rule over Nubia.27 But the role of the royal sister is fundamental, as the god Amun unites with her. The concept of divine birth - well known from Egyptian examples - was also present in Nubia: the fact that the royal sisters in their role as god's priestesses were particularly venerated also derives from their importance as vehicle of legitimacy.28 As the king acted as god's earthly embodiment, he repeated the mystical union with his sister. Thus, any child coming from this union was a divine son. The same action, repeated by the succession of Nubian kings, should have given birth to a series of royal offspring, the snww nsw, with one generation encroaching on the next.29 The alliance between god and king Alara was stated a few times in Nubian royal inscriptions after Taharqo's reign. Other than in Kawa IV and VI, Pi(ankh)y-Alara is present in Nastasen's stela (1. 8): sw pi mir-si rd nsw P-(rnh) }I-h-Rc mn.f 'It is the garden in which king Piankhy-Alara grew up'. Pi(ankh)y-Alara is also mentioned in the same text (11. 14-16): iw sdm irm.i Imn Np pl. i ri di.n.f &lt;n&gt;.i Imn Npy pl. i it nfr ns{yt) n pi ti n Sty pi hiy nsw Hr-si-it.f nht nsw P-(rnh)-I-li-n Amun of Napata being with me, listened to me, to my speech. He gave me, Amun of Napata, my good father, the kingship of the Bow-land, the crown of king Harsiotef and the power of king Pi(ankh)y-Alara'.3° Those references denote the relevance such a link had with the past for a Nubian king's legitimacy. Alara's reference is not the only one anyway, as Kashta also appears in Kawa IX (11. 53-4): dd [n.f hm.]f di.k n.i rhr qi hr-tp ti rdi.n.k n.i mi ir.n.k n nsw 1-l-r [mir-hrw] 'His [Majesty] said [to him], "Grant me a long life on earth, and give to me as you did for king Alara [justified]'".

I give you as I [gave] to king [Kashta, justified]'.31 The fact that Kawa IV and VI talk about a rebuilding of Temple T at Gematen at least four years after the first works started may look like strange, as Kawa III describes donations and activities in that temple from the second regnal year.32 This 26 S.

Török, CRIPEL 17, 214. L. Török, 'On the Foundations of the Kingship Ideology in the Empire of Kush', in Wenig (ed.), Studien zum antiken Sudan, 280 considers the legitimacy of the ruling king through the female ancestors as complementary to the Gottessohnschaft and patrilinear succession rules. 28 For this aspect, see C. E. Sander-Hansen, Das Gottesweib des Amun (Historisk-filologiske Skrifter 1/1; Copenhagen. 104.0). 16-17: H. Brunner, Die Geburt des Gottköniss (ÄA 10; Wiesbaden, 1086). 29 See D. Kahn, 'The Royal Succession in the 25th Dynasty', MittSAG 16 (2005), 146-52 for a recent study. 30 Török, Image of the Ordered World, 361 n. 127 believes that Piye is used as a form of royal title, like Caesar during the Roman Empire. 31 As noted by Jansen-Winkeln, Or 72, 106, the reference to Kashta might have been created due to the tact that that king was the first to take control over Egypt. 32 See Macadam, Kawa I, 4-14 and pis 5, 6.</page><page sequence="13">2OO9 KAWA V AND TAHARQO'S BYÏWT 247 oddity becomes more comprehensible when the concept of reciprocity between Taharqo and his god is introduced. With complete disregard for chronological sequence, Taharqo explains his sorrow for the dilapidated conditions of the temple, coronation and reconstruction of the sanctuary all as part of the divine interchange between king and god. It is this reciprocity which introduces the omen of Alara's times.33 The chronological sequence is correct, but events separated by years from each other are summarised in a streamlined narrative. The pattern is also part of Kawa V stela. When viewed in concert with the signs of Kawa V, the passages from Kawa IV and VI become significant instances of the superior knowledge of the king over his subjects. As John Baines says, with reference to the text known as the King as the Sun Priest, 'It does not matter what the "Eastern Souls" sing at sunrise; what is important is that the king knows it (and others not). Such knowledge sets the king apart, as a knower and as an actor'.34 The king is initiated to a level of knowledge that equates him to the Eastern Souls, and by consequence detached from common mortals. The pharaoh as sole ritual priest was still part of Twenty-fifth Dynasty royal ideology, as Taharqo made clear at Karnak in the Building of the Sacred Lake, where a copy of the hymn of the King as Sun Priest is present.35 In that sense, Taharqo's Kawa IV and VI fully repeat the same image of the king initiated to superior secrets.36 As supreme priest, he is able to have direct contact with god, accessing his secret knowledge. But this also includes declaring what was asked for by his ancestor: as a hidden part of the relationship between king and god, Taharqo unveils Alara's old alliance to his subjects. The building activities promoted by Taharqo, visible to the non-adepts, reveal what was already proclaimed in the past: the origins of the Nubian royal dynasty lay in divine descent, and Taharqo was the most recent embodiment. As Alara's alliance with Amun constituted his recognition as king and established the royal sister as the vehicle of legitimisation, Kawa V repeats the same scheme. Instead of Alara, there is Taharqo, the last in the succession line, and Abalo is the royal sister. If interpreted as such, Taharqo's legitimate succession to Shebitqo is the third omen. Taharqo's rights can be stated thanks to the royal mother, whose arrival is 33 Török, Image of the Ordered World, 401 reconstructs the events in such a sequence: 701 (Taharqo as recruit), - &gt; 690 (Taharqo's coronation), - » 701 (Taharqo's visit to the temple), - » 780-760 (Alara's alliance with the god), - * 690 (beginning of the building activities), - * 685 (description of the works achieved). 34 See J.

Alcock (SiE; London, 1995), 18-25, with recent bibliography and list of the copies at pp. 17-18 nn. 3- 11. The relevance of the text in Nubian royal ideology has been also noted by Verhoeven, in Clarysse, Schoors, and Willems (eds.), Egyptian Religion, II, 1492. 35 Text A - the so called morning text - is published by R. A. Parker, J. Leclant, and J.-C. Goyon, The Edifice of Taharqa by the Sacred Lake of Karnak (BEStud 8; Providence, 1979), 31-2, 38-40 with pis 12C, 13, 15, and 18B, and translated in Assmann, Solar Religion, 18-20. See also M. C. Betrò, / testi solari del portale di Pascerientaisu (BN2) (Saqqâra 3; Pisa, 1990), 38-50, where all versions of the morning text are given. Taharqo acts as intermediary between god and humans.

Cooney, 'The Edifice of Taharqa by the Sacred Lake: Ritual Function and the Rule of the King', JARCE 37 (2000), 45-6. 3 I örök, CRIPEL 17, 213, had already remarked the secret knowledge aspect that pervades the entire group of Nubian royal inscriptions.</page><page sequence="14">248 ROBERTO B. GOZZOLI JEA 95 narrated immediately after, as the fourth omen. The royal mother's visit is not then just a re-enactment of the Horus legend; it is also its ideological climax.37 In Kawa V - as well as Nasalsa and the female royal ancestors mentioned in Aspelta's Election stela - Abalo's role connects the past to the future and permits the transmission of the royal power to her son Taharqo, conforming to what was established by Alara almost a century earlier. Her presence at her son's coronation is a physical reminder that any claim to the Nubian throne passed through her.38 She is the physical re-enactment of that established bond between god and king: Taharqo mentions the previous deed of his ancestor because the consequences are still valid in his own times; that is to say, the Nubian king is the latest fruit of that alliance. Considering the byit as both past and present element, this justifies my translation as 'omen', 'sign', or even 'oracle', as the old translation of 'wonder' becomes too generic. Kawa IV, V, and VI do not speak about coregencies, only about divine alliances and royal legitimacy. My interpretation then confirms Macadam's original idea, obviously with the corrections mentioned above. The connection between Amun and Taharqo may also justify the textual differences between Tanis and Kawa V with their mention of the four omens absent from the Matanieh and Coptos copies. In Tanis as well as Gematen/Kawa, the main god was Amun, with whom Alara made his pact. Matanieh and Coptos had their own gods, Henen and Min, who were depicted in the lunette. Possibly, mention of the great omens made by Amun was felt not to be appropriate in the last two places. 37 I cannot agree with Török, Image of the Ordered World, 405, who reduces the visit of the royal mother to a final rite of the coronation ceremonies. With Lohwasser, JARCE 38, 68, I see the royal mother's presence as both the way the god is satisfied and as the way his power is chanelled into the king, his son and earthly intermediary. 38 For the speeches delivered by the royal mother on the occasion ot her son s coronation, see i^ohwasser, JARCE 38, 68-9. For Nubian royal women giving libations in front of Amun, see A. Lohwasser, 'Die Handlungen der Kuschitischen Königin im Götterkult', CRIPEL 17/3 (1998) 135-46.</page></plain_text>
