<plain_text><page sequence="1">HUME'S DIALOGUES RECONSIDERED GEOFFREY CLIVE* IN THIS essay the historical (ge- schichtliche) and philosophical sig- nificance of Hume's Dialogues con- cerning Natural Religion is reconsidered along the following lines: (1) by stress- ing the conventionally neglected role of Demea among the three participants; (2) by calling attention to the sub- stantial agreement between him and Philo over against Cleanthes; and (3) by emphasizing Philo's pessimism about the consequences of his own position. On this basis it is argued that the immediate impact of the Dialogues was not the most fundamental or primary one: the destruction of the philosophical preten- sions of a type of Christian orthodoxy (deism) turned out less crucial in Hume's thinking than laying the ground- work for a new religiousness exemplified by the existentialist leap of Kierke- gaard, on the one hand, and the ma- terialistic humanism of Feuerbach, on the other. In this, Hume was as much a prophetic critic of the Enlightenment as its brilliant voice. Contrary to all too many of those who call themselves "Humeans" in our day, Hume clearly recognized the disastrous split between subject and object which has haunted modern philosophy since Descartes. While Philo's "sovereign reason" re- lentlessly presses its claims against "wishful thinking," at the same time it comes to acknowledge its own limita- tions especially in areas such as religion, where man's body and soul are insepa- rably linked. On this interpretation, Hume's Philo, whatever Hume's actual intentions may have been, continues to live more creatively in the work of the existential theologians and the poets of despair, otherworldly and secular, than in the tedious utterances of positivists, whose best reason for not believing in God remains that they cannot perceive him as an unadulterated datum. Like so many of Kant's works, Hume's Dia- logues belong in large measure to the nineteenth century. A participant's account of an event or phenomenon is invariably different from a spectator's, much as the advice of a fellow sufferer in a concrete situ- ation is not necessarily better or worse than, but certainly distinct from, that of an outsider. One sphere where this difference emerges most sharply is in philosphies and histories of religion. The so-called "objective" accounts reveal these features: disinterestedness, uni- versality of outlook, irony, playfulness, open-mindedness, and neutrality. Chris- tianity, on such a view, would be re- garded as another of the world's major religions which has had a tremendous influence on the development of civiliza- * Geoffrey Clive is assistant professor of philoso- phy at Clark University.

What the scholar, scrupulously ex- amining the available evidence, is or intends himself becomes entirely tangen- tial to his central concern-exact deline- ation. The appeal of the resulting work rests on its "dispassionate" elucidation of the issues. Over against this approach must be placed the account of the "com- mitted" writer. He, too, will utilize schol- arly apparatus, but there is no getting away from the fact that he speaks a different language. By virtue of being a believing Christian or believing enemy of Christianity, he will not regard it as just another of the world's major reli- gions. Not that he need become a prose- lytizer or demagogue, though his work will unmistakably disclose his interest- edness and stake in whatever is being discussed. The most distinguishing char- acteristics are authenticity, moral seri- ousness, particularism, and stubborn- ness. No attempt is made to separate the standpoint of the author from his material. The reader is made to feel that he had to write about this and nothing else, that he received a kind of religious call to have his say. Since the "committed" writer knows his subject matter intimately, having experienced it personally (erlebt) in some fashion, his books, inadequate as they may be in other respects, will have a decided ring of forcefulness and in- tensity about them. Strange as the term may appear here, it is precisely this kind of writing that possesses the greatest "objectivity." For it is impossible to be objective about something known only at a distance, where the object of de- scription is an experience inseparably linked to the consciousness of the indi- vidual describing it. Take Hume's treat- ment of religion-an acknowledged sem- inal expression of Enlightenment clarity and rigor. It is indeed tolerant, worldly, aesthetically pleasant, and pervaded by Olympian calm. All ecstasy and passion (though Hume knew better and said so) seem harnessed in the service of un- biased understanding. The reader has a hard time deciding why Hume bothered to write about this particular subject. He skirts the fringes, illuminates corners, cuts through superstructures, but main- tains the appearance of shrinking away from the heart of his theme. In his treat- ment of miracles he remarks very truly: all eyewitness accounts must be mis- trusted, especially where the phenome- non observed is so extraordinary that it clashes with common sense. Hearing the observation "there are blue swans in the pond," I am justified in supposing that the observer's vision is defective and my accustomed association of swans with non-blueness confirmed. But, in saying this, Hume misses the core of New Testament miracle situations, wherein the witness expressed his faith in Christ before the miracles arose. Belief in a miracle in the context of the Gospels was never conceived as the culmination of an inductive process but as an ethical- religious commitment to act in a certain manner. Those who look on and in from the outside may show better judgment than the participants, but at the price of some irrelevance or triviality. Nevertheless, granting his Enlighten- ment terror of fanaticism, an addiction to grotesque understatement, and a tend- ency to substitute fairness for insight, in his Dialogues concerning Natural Re- ligion Hume transcends the issues which occasioned their composition. At first sight Cleanthes is defending "natural re- ligion" from the "sifting, inquisitive dis- position" of Philo to undermine all tra- ditional values. Pious Demea, seemingly like Cleanthes, champions unsophisti- cated belief against free thought. Yet the</page><page sequence="3">112 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION disputes which arise between these two apologists for religious faith in opposi- tion to skepticism are more revealing than their agreement. What Hume pre- sents us with is not the kind of simple setup in which three individuals express diverse points of view of which two are opposed to the third, but a genuinely dialectical situation where each perspec- tive comes into separate collision with the others. Thus at the end of Part XI Cleanthes bitterly remarks that Philo has been calculating enough to be in league with Demea. Apart from the mer- its of this personal suspicion, the ac- cumulating complexities of the argument (many of which escaped Cleanthes) no longer warranted his identification of orthodoxy with intellectual and moral virtue. Hume's unattachment to any concrete religious tradition, while often engender- ing the illusion that facts about God are qualitatively equal with other facts in history, did not prevent him from com- ing to terms with the principal tensions in the religious circumstances of Chris- tendom. Cleanthes is a man of little faith, who claims to establish the Su- preme Being by reversing the traditional formula "credo ut intellegam" and rely- ing instead on the likeness of causes to their discernible effects: as if arguments, disregarding their degree of coherence for the moment, could take the place of faith or as if it had been any easier for Augustine, ignorant of modern science, to believe than for a student of New- ton. Philo's celebrated counterthrusts (causes and effects must resemble each other, nobody has ever experienced any- thing remotely comparable to the crea- tion of the world, etc.) are ultimately of less import than Cleanthes' persistent attempt to transform mysteries into problems. Ironically enough, his naive overestimate of the intellect in matters not wholly theoretical has become dis- torted as a Humean heritage. Philo makes it quite plain to Cleanthes that whether or not the world be conceived as a ma- chine or as an organism is religiously beside the point. In short, he destroys more than Cleanthes' arguments by at- tacking his attitude toward these argu- ments. He ends up saying that science and religion have their respective auton- omies, however much or little they over- lap in particular instances. Demea, on the other hand, is a proto- typal fideist who, notwithstanding his lack of sophistication and dialectical skill, has a genuine insight into the "evi- dence of things unseen." Modern men who have continued to believe, in part perhaps because their awareness of mo- dernity did not cramp their way of life, share with Demea an oversimplified but sound conviction of what God means to them. In contrast is Philo, with his un- compromising separation of philosophi- cal from Christian pursuits, his prefer- ence (to paraphrase James) for damna- tion over against error, and his skepti- cism that underlies virtually all religious philosophizing in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. A humanist on the whole, Philo's pessimism points ahead to both nihilism and the anguish of the ex- istentialists. Thus Hume's three spokes- men are anything but stock rococo fig- ures endowed at intervals by their creator with extraordinary powers of verbalization. Cleanthes' complacency suggests the eclipse of a live Christian culture; antagonistic Philo traverses precariously the never-never land of self-consuming criticism; and orthodox Demea enters a fundamentalist ivory tower. His self-righteousness, coupled with Philo's irreverence and Cleanthes' temporizing, pretty well defines a world</page><page sequence="4">HUME'S DIALOGUES RECONSIDERED 113 where nothing is sacred, fanaticisms come and pass, and men take rain checks on their lives--our world. In freely ex- posing the shortcomings of his antago- nists, Hume's Dialogues went way be- yond the controversy over natural reli- gion (resolved therein) and raised crit- ical issues that are yet to be relieved. Interpreters content to reiterate that Hume has never been answered in deal- ing the death blow to the varieties of rational theism miss a far more abiding aspect of his Dialogues, namely, their challenge to overcome the chasm be- tween experience and knowledge with regard to truth so characteristic of post- Cartesian thought. In this rather unorthodox treatment of the Dialogues four aspects are re- viewed as worth noting: first, Cleanthes' criticism of Philo on the limits of skep- ticism; second, Cleanthes' and Demea's disagreement on anthropomorphism in religion; third, Philo's and Demea's common ground of emotivism; and final- ly, Philo's latent nihilism as at variance with the aspirations of Enlightenment naturalism. This focus on the dialectical interplay in the Dialogues is intended to correct, not to refute, the one-sided view of their place in the history of phi- losophy as a manifesto on supernatural contamination. My interpretation fol- lows a line of thought close to Professor Basil Willey's in his latest volume of Nineteenth Century Studies, where he shows how the agnostics and freethink- ers in England have done far more for the survival and revival of Protestant Christianity than the inside apologists of the Establishment. Hume, I would maintain, helped clear the air of a lot of theological nonsense which had made Christianity's future prospects as a re- ligion embracing the educated, dim in- deed. Quite possibly this further con- firms the observation that the best Christian thinking since the seventeenth century has been done by "negative theologians" outside the church. Hume certainly would have relished the role of God's advocate in rococo finery. While Philo proves an indomitable adversary of natural religion and a clear- sighted critic of theological pretentious- ness, the weakness of his position emerges on being confronted by the re- ligious consciousness in its more con- crete manifestations. Cleanthes is quick to seize upon it. "To erect religious faith on philosophical scepticism" may be an admirable occupation particularly con- genial to a placid temperament, but for the majority of mankind implicated in the precariousness of existence this is sheer talk: Though a man, in a flush of humour, after intense reflection on the many contradictions and imperfections of human reason, may en- tirely renounce all belief and opinion, it is impossible for him to persevere in this total scepticism or to make it appear in his con- duct for a few hours. External objects press upon him; his philosophical melancholy dis- sipates; and even the utmost violence upon his temper will not be able, during any time, to preserve the poor appearance of scepticism.1 Whether or not "philosophical scepti- cism dissipates" depends on variables that Cleanthes does not consider here; but surely he is correct in rejecting the skeptical mood as a sufficient condition for faith or even as a favorable anteced- ent. In the realm of religion no modern doubter appears to have found faith on the basis of his doubt alone. The kind of life Kierkegaard led can be accepted only by the "exceptional individual" that he was, and even he sharply deline- ated the alternatives between "honesty," with its "sickness unto death," and "faith," with its "leap" into the arms of God. William James in expounding his</page><page sequence="5">114 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION "will to believe" admitted that modern man would rather be damned and un- committed to a false proposition than saved with the risk of being mistaken, at the same time insisting that this is an impossible state of affairs for most men to put up with indefinitely. The suspen- sion of belief in matters that concern us intimately, he argues, is untenable. Philo's failure to realize anything like this must, I think, be attributed to the excess intellectualism by which Hume's age was especially tempted. The divorce of sentiment from intellect is precisely what a religious claim on an individual does not sanction. Whereas Cleanthes is incompetent in defending a "reasonable" Christianity against the strictures of the very reason he deems thoroughly com- patible with faith, his verdict on Philo's skepticism in the area of values is funda- mentally sound. Either it becomes inter- nally inconsistent by professing faith in spite of itself, or as Kierkegaard, Dostoevski, and Nietzsche were to re- veal, it leads to suicidal nihilism. Though the gulf between Philo and Cleanthes is wide enough and does in fact constitute the immediate occasion for the Dialogues, the discussion is vital- ized by the presence of Demea, who, far from being merely an orthodox simple- ton reiterating unanswerable pieties, succeeds on the whole in making a better case than Cleanthes does. Nor is his agreement on certain matters with Philo to be discounted as contrived for the sake of special pleading. It develops that the split between the two believers is of a deeper kind than separates the princi- pal antagonists. What Hume confronts us with here is a prophetic version of the peculiar affinity that existentialism and positivism have for each other: It seems strange to me, said Cleanthes, that you, Demea, who are so sincere in the cause of religion, should still maintain the mysteri- ous, incomprehensible nature of the Deity, and should insist so strenuously that he has no manner of likeness or resemblance to hu- man creatures. The Deity, I can readily allow, possesses many powers and attributes of which we can have no comprehension; but, if our ideas, so far as they go be not just ade- quate and correspondent to his real nature, I know not what there is in this subject worth insisting on. Is the name, without any mean- ing, of such mighty importance? Or how do you mystics, who maintain the absolute in- comprehensibility of the Deity, differ from sceptics or atheists, who assert that the first cause of all is unknown and unintelligible? Their temerity must be very great if, after rejecting the production by a mind-I mean a mind resembling the human (for I know no other)-they pretend to assign, with certain- ty, any other specific intelligible cause; and their conscience must be very scrupulous, in- deed, if they refuse to call the universal un- known cause a God or Deity, and to bestow on him as many sublime eulogies and un- meaning epithets as you shall please to require of them. Who could imagine, replied Demea, that Cleanthes, the calm philosophical Cleanthes, would attempt to refute his antagonists by af- fixing a nickname to them, and, like the com- mon bigots and inquisitors of the age, have recourse to invective and declamation instead of reasoning? Or does he not perceive that these topics are easily retorted, and that an- thropomorphite is an appellation as invidious, and implies as dangerous consequences, as the epithet of mystic, with which he has honoured us? In reality, Cleanthes, consider what it is you assert when you represent the Deity as similar to the human mind and understanding. . . . Pray consider, said Philo, whom you are at present inveighing against [addressing Cleanthes]. You are honouring with the ap- pelation of atheist all the sound, orthodox di- vines, almost, who have treated of this sub- ject; and you will at last be, yourself, found, according to your reckoning, the only sound theist in the world. But if idolaters be athe- ists, as, I think, may justly be asserted, and Christian theologians the same, what becomes of the argument, so much celebrated, derived from the universal consent of mankind?2</page><page sequence="6">HUME'S DIALOGUES RECONSIDERED 115 I quote this passage at length because it defines so well the dilemma which con- tinues to perplex theist thinkers: if God is knowable, then he must be conceived in finite categories; if, on the other hand, God is hidden, then he transcends any intelligible formulation of his nature. Either God is knowable, or he is hidden. Hence either he can be grasped by the reason, or he remains an object of non- cognitive faith. Many attempts, to be sure, have been made to take this dilem- ma by the horns or to escape through them, but they have all been unsuccess- ful for the simple reason that any solu- tion presupposes a settlement of the very point around which the argument re- volves. The Incarnation is often adduced in support of the claim that, through Christianity, immediacy and mystery became interfused, meaning (among other things) that God is at once re- vealed to and withdrawn from human apprehension. But this begs the ques- tion, inasmuch as the Incarnation itself is a mystery, a paradox, as Kierkegaard put it, that constitutes an "offense" to the natural man. The other way out is equally unsatisfactory. For if you main- tain, like Cleanthes, "though it be al- lowed that the Deity possesses attributes of which we have no comprehension, yet we ought never to ascribe to him any attributes which are absolutely incom- patible with that intelligent nature es- sential to him,'"3 you set yourself up as the authority which determines what God should be, a procedure contrary to the core of biblical religion with its pri- mary injunction that the Will of the Lord need not at all times be commen- surate with, or open to inspection by, the will of his creatures. Religious obedi- ence is different from philosophical approval. In our own day, for the moment, Cleanthes has clearly lost ground to Demea. Largely owing to the genius of Kierkegaard in restating fundamental biblical insights and the tremendous in- fluence of Karl Barth, Protestant Chris- tian thought has virtually repudiated anthropomorphism. This by no means entails a solution of the dilemma out- lined above, but it does affirm the legiti- macy of paradox in a prophetic faith over against the claims of common sense. Whatever Christianity is not, it is un- avoidably a mystery religion, and the mystery cannot be abolished without the religion. Anthropomorphic elements, on this interpretation, are either sanctioned concessions to human inadequacy (if not downright distortions) or an inherent part of the mystery itself. In any event, the complete humanization of theism as envisaged by Feuerbach is properly re- garded as its annulment. The chasm be- tween the secular and the divine which Cleanthes would not recognize is once again seen as part of the backbone of biblical faith. Meanwhile, a prominent school of philosophy inspired by Hume has given unexpected support to this de- velopment in theology. "Whereof we cannot speak we must remain silent" can also be taken as a philosophical justification of Demea's position. Since science is incompetent to deal scientifi- cally with values, it is legitimate to hold them on non-scientific grounds; in fact, this is the only way we can hold them. What human beings generally regard as most meaningful is not transparent to exact verification procedures, but this need not be a calamity. To my mind, Wittgenstein and Barth have no quarrel on this point. Neither, thanks to Hume's perspicacity, did Philo and Demea. Such agreement, however, between skeptics</page><page sequence="7">116 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION and believers since the eighteenth cen- tury is essentially negative, resting, as it were, on a common acceptance of the limitations of human reason to establish itself or any set of primitive assump- tions.4 This surprising note of unanimity be- tween Philo and Demea is struck again as they reflect together on the misery and wickedness which pervade experi- ence. To be sure, such a perennial theme has made bedfellows of the greatest an- tagonists in the history of thought; yet it can be seen that their mutual under- standing on this score goes far beyond a conventional recital of complaints. Moreover, once again, their adversary is Cleanthes, who characteristically tells them that "if you can make out the pres- ent point, and prove mankind to be un- happy or corrupted, there is an end at once of all religion."5 The Christendom against which Kierkegaard aimed his at- tack was of the same mind about this matter, and so are most "adjusted" Protestants today. Hume was more realistic: It is my opinion, I own, replied Demea, that each man feels, in a manner, the truth of religion within his own breast, and, from a consciousness of his imbecility and misery rather than from any reasoning, is led to seek protection from that Being on whom he and all nature is dependent. So anxious or so tedi- ous are even the best scenes of life that fu- turity is still the object of our hopes and fears. * . I am indeed persuaded, said Philo, that the best and indeed the only method of bring- ing everyone to a due sense of religion is by just representations of the misery and wick- edness of man. And for that purpose a talent of eloquence and strong imagery is more req- uisite than that of reasoning and argument. For is it necessary to prove what everyone feels within himself? 'Tis only necessary to make us feel it, if possible, more intimately and sensibly. .. . Man, it is true, can by combination, sur- mount all his real enemies and become master of the whole animal creation; but does he not immediately raise up to himself imaginary ene- mies, the demons of his fancy, who haunt him with superstitious terrors and blast every en- joyment of life?6 Philosophical skepticism and biblical religion find a common meeting ground in human feeling. Removed from the ordinary claims of verifiability, self-evi- dent to all but the dehumanized, univer- sally invoked and sung by the poets, it became throughout the nineteenth cen- tury the ideal authority for those who could not explain what they meant or who had lost hope of saying anything mean- ingful about what agitated them the most. Contrary to the optimistic ration- alism of Cleanthes, the preservation and efficacy of religion in the lives of indi- viduals (as well as in cultures) can be accounted for largely by its satisfaction of the perennial human need for reas- surance, purification, and hope amid the dread and perplexities of Being. Were mankind innocent and happy, it would have nothing to crave for, no ideal to set off from the way things are, and religion would disappear. It is precisely the gloomier aspects of life (and the pros- pect of death) that make men question their own self-sufficiency and turn to God.7 But feeling in itself (like skepticism) is no dependable guide to religious truth. This was one of the painful discoveries made by the Romantics. The intuitive apprehension of wickedness and misery is as compatible with nihilism as with the acceptance of any body of revealed truth. Schopenhauer's pessimism, for example, flows as consistently from an acute insight into the dynamics of will as does Kierkegaard's theism or Nietz- sche's Ubermensch ideology. Philo and Demea do well to stress the emotive roots of religious faith over against the prevailing intellectualism not uncongen-</page><page sequence="8">HUME'S DIALOGUES RECONSIDERED 117 ial to Hume himself; at the same time, they tend to minimize the capriciousness of human feeling unless oriented beyond itself to something given. The great problem for the nineteenth century (and it is still ours today) was to square a purely quantitative account of reality, devoid of any intrinsic significance for human hopes and fears, with the occi- dental passion for meaningfulness in historical events. "Feeling," "dialectical necessity," "progress," "evolution"-all these were used as categories to bridge the gap between fact and value, but to no avail. Only fanatics (the Marxists, for instance) solved the problem by clos- ing their minds to its complexities. The mystics continued to wonder whether they were in touch with something not merely symbolically real, hence in all likelihood a private or public illusion; and the skeptics continued their quest for principles of choice and action that, if found, would vindicate themselves as metaskeptical. Philo's radical skepticism linked with "subjectivism" in matters of value fore- shadows the varieties of nihilism that began to appear early in the nineteenth century. He is not yet the militant type of nihilist who openly declares that God is dead or that, without him, everything becomes permissible, nor does he inveigh against every type of order for being "artificial" or (which is far from unre- lated) condone every type of order as circumstantially justified. The spiritual crisis of Western man had not pene- trated quite so deeply, though Hume undoubtedly sensed its breakthrough. Strictly speaking, the Dialogues never question the existence of the Deity but confine themselves to discrediting spuri- ous means for establishing his nature. Yet when Philo comes to speak of evil in the world, he reveals himself as typi- cally modern, in the sense that the nega- tive aspects of reality strike him far more forcefully than whatever positive factors might also be considered. Van- ished is Augustine's confidence in the ultimate harmony of all things under God and its diluted version in Leibniz' theodicy. Receded also has the concern with moral evil which was always pri- mary not only for Christian thinkers but for the Greeks as well. Philo virtually ignores the evil that lies not in circum- stance or nature but in the heart and mind of man (Eigenwelt). "Almost all the moral as well as natural evils of hu- man life," he remarks, in what is pos- sibly the most naive sentence Hume ever wrote, "arise from idleness; and were our species by the original constitution of their frame, exempt from this vice or infirmity, the perfect cultivation of land, the improvement of arts and manufac- tures, the exact execution of every office and duty, immediately follow; and men at once may fully reach that state of society which is so imperfectly attained by the best regulated government."' On the other hand, here is Philo, de- scribing the Umvelt: The world, for aught he (anyone) knows, is very faulty and imperfect, compared to a superior standard, and was only the first rude essay of some infant deity who afterwards abandoned it, ashamed of his lame perform- ance; it is the work only of some dependent, inferior deity, and is the object of derision to his superiors; it is the production of old age and dotage in some superannuated deity, and ever since his death has run on at adventures, from the first impulse and active force which it received from him. Look around the universe. What an im- mense profusion of beings, animated and or- ganized, sensible and active! You admire this prodigious variety and fecundity. But inspect a little more narrowly these living existences, the only beings worth regarding. How hostile and destructive to each other! How insuffi- cient all of them for their own happiness!</page><page sequence="9">118 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION How contemptible or odious to the spectator! The whole presents nothing but the idea of blind nature, impregnated by a great vivify- ing principle, and pouring forth from her lap, without discernment or parental care, her maimed and abortive children!9 No existentialist, secular or religious, has presented a more negative estimate of man's natural condition than this. (Fortunate for Hume and the eighteenth century that they could stick to the spec- tator's point of view-up to the French Revolution.) Both man and the external world are regarded as abandoned, sacri- ficed, so to speak, to the capriciousness of indifferent forces. Not only is there no enduring preponderance of good over evil (as in Augustine), but even the Manichaean hypothesis of a perennial conflict between the two up to a Last Judgment in favor of the former is re- pudiated for a hypothesis which con- ceives the first cause of the universe to "have neither goodness nor malice." Just as a child would rather be spanked on occasion than perpetually unloved and ignored, so the acceptance of total non- purposiveness as "by far the most prob- able hypothesis" on the part of Western man is tantamount to spiritual suicide. Such a position is contrary to every au- thentic form of Judaism and Christian- ity, as well as being in conflict with the belief in history as a meaningful pattern of events leading to a specific consum- mation. This belief is as necessary for the "scientific" socialist as for religious orthodoxy, not to mention the vast ma- jority in the West today who profess a vague, but often impassioned, hope in the future of their country, civilization, or way of living. Its fundamental con- tradiction to the over-all tradition does not, of course, invalidate Philo's stand; rather it shows that the tradition was already dying in the keenest mind of the eighteenth century. Unless nihilism were assimilated as a new type of religious experience, Philo's point of view here connects with the many processes of self-division that we keep on trying to overcome. The tension between Job, who continued to argue with God in spite of every discouragement visited upon him, and Philo, who speculatively acquiesces in a meaningless world which his feel- ings cannot bear, defines the predica- ment of contemporary Western civiliza- tion. Fairly tranquil conditions (at least for a minority to which Hume belonged) still allowed him to rely on periodic dis- tractions at the billiard table, where, as he informs us in the Treatise, the phi- losopher gives himself up to less gloomy reflections than those which preoccupy him in his study. Unfortunately, per- haps, the permanent possibility of such diversion has since been shattered for everyone. In reflection, at any rate, Hume could hardly avoid touching the abyss which his successors either wal- lowed in, struggled to conquer, or dis- honestly evaded. The Dialogues con- cerning Natural Religion are free from the scars of direct identification which characterize most significant nineteenth- century and contemporary literature on religion, but they certainly testify to the genius of their author in discerning the signs of the times."x NOTES 1.

Hume and Kierkegaard, whatever the differ- ences between them on points of departure and ultimate principles, are in agreement on the inade- quacy of reason and immediate experience to re- solve religious problems. In his celebrated essay "On Miracles" Hume argues that the likelihood of</page><page sequence="10">HUME'S DIALOGUES RECONSIDERED 119 their not having occurred is more convincing than the reliability of the witnesses on whose testimony they are believed. In Training in Christianity Kierkegaard maintains that to regard miracles as anything other than objects of faith twice removed from "immediacy" by the contradiction of the God-man and "the possibility of offence" is blas- phemy. Hume also would have concurred with these propositions: "For the proofs remain equivocal: they are the pro et contra of the reasoning intel- lect, and therefore can be used contra et pro. It is only by choice that the heart is revealed (and surely it was for this cause Christ came into the world, that the thoughts of all hearts might be re- vealed, by the choice whether to believe or be offended" (Training in Christianity, p. 98). Choice for both Kierkegaard and Hume is basically a mat- ter of the heart. Hume was keenly conscious of the varying for- tunes of skepticism in the history of Christianity: "During ignorant ages," Philo remarks, "such as those which followed the dissolution of the ancient schools, the priests perceived that atheism, deism, or heresy of any kind, could only proceed from the presumptuous questioning of received opinion, and from a belief that human reason was equal to every- thing. . . . But at present, when the influence of education is much diminished and men, from a more open commerce of the world, have learned to compare the popular principles of different na- tions and ages, our sagacious divines have changed their whole system of philosophy and talk the lan- guage of Stoics, Platonists, and Peripatetics, not that of Pyrrhonians and Academics. If we distrust human reason we now have no other principle to lead us into religion. Thus sceptics in one age, dogmatists in another" (Dialogues, pp. 13-14). Note the irony of "sagacious divines," for Hume himself, especially in the Dialogues, was aiding and abetting the growing distrust of human reason which led to a new understanding of skepticism with religion. This passage in effect is a parody of Cleanthes' claim of contemporaneousness as if he knew what the score was to be. Philo and Hume knew better. 5. Dialogues, p. 67. 6. Ibid., p. 61. 7. Here again Hume proves a perspicacious critic of his time: "Formerly, [Philo speaking] it was a most popular theological topic to maintain that human life was vanity and misery, and to exagger- ate all the ills and pains which are incident to men. But of late years, divines, we find, begin to retract this position and maintain, though still with some hesitation, that there are more goods than evils, more pleasures than pains, even in this life" (ibid., p. 80). 8. Ibid., p. 76. If Hume had only written "ennui" or "uneasiness" in place of "idleness," this might still be a defensible view (cf. P. Hazard, The Euro- pean Mind [1953]). 9. Dialogues, pp. 41 and 79.
