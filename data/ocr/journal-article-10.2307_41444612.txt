<plain_text><page sequence="1">Abraham Joshua Heschel Symposium HESCHEL IN THE CONTEXT OF MODERN JEWISH RELIGIOUS THOUGHT Norman Solomon Abraham Joshua Heschel (1907-1972) hailed from a Hasidic family which numbered among its members the Rebbe of Apt, after whom he was named, and the Maggid (Preacher) of Mezhirichi (Mezhirech, in Volhynia, Ukraine), a prominent Hasidic leader in the generation following the Baal Shem Tov.1 The Judaism he first knew and mastered in his native Poland was that of Talmud, Kabbala and Bible as read and as lived in the Hasidic tradition. Throughout his life he retained the sense of the constant presence of God and of the holiness of creation which he had imbibed in the intense, inward- looking world of his youth, and he sought to capture its spirit for posterity in works such as The Earth is the Lord's and A Passion for Truth (his comparative spiritual biography of the Kotzker Rebbe and the Protestant theologian Soren Kierkegaard). But western culture beckoned, and at the age of twenty he headed for Berlin, where he enrolled as a student at the Jewish Academy (the Hochschule) and at the Friedrich-Wilhelm University. He was not alone. Berlin, under the Weimar Republic, proved an irresistible magnet for central European Jews who were dazzled by its high culture and heady intellectual ferment.2 Most became thoroughly secularized, many of them contributing richly to the cultural and scientific life of pre-Nazi Germany. Others, Heschel among them, held on to their religious tradition in greater or lesser degree, aiming to recast it in what they thought was an acceptably modern form. Among those of his contemporaries who remained religious were men such as Hayyim Heller, later to achieve note as a Biblical and Talmudic scholar; Isaac Hutner; the Talmudist, the rabbi and scholar Alexander Altmann; Joseph Ber Soloveitchik * Rabbi Dr Norman Solomon was Fellow in Modern Jewish Thought at the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies, and formerly Director of the Centre for the Study of Judaism and Jewish/Christian Relations at the Selly Oak Colleges, Birmingham.

Such a list is of astonishing breadth, encompassing the German enlightened tradition and Lithuanian Talmudic scholarship as well as the Hasidism of Poland and Ukraine, and includes many of the future religious leaders of world Jewry. Martin Buber (1878-1965) and Franz Rosenzweig (1886-1929) were probably the strongest Jewish influences on Heschel 's thinking during his Berlin period. He succeeded Buber as Principal of the Freies Jüdisches Lehrhaus - a sort of Jewish Open University with responsibility for Jewish adult education in Germany - in 1937, but was himself deported the following year. Despite disagreements with Buber that were by no means negligible, he held like Buber that the focus of Judaism, indeed of all religion, lay in religious experience rather than in reason, in the individual encounter with God in the present rather than in a unique historical revelation long ago at Sinai. Yet they had reached this position from opposite directions. Buber, the assimilated, secular German Jew, in revolt against the 'old' systematic philosophy of his teacher, Hermann Cohen, had discovered what he regarded as the essence of Judaism in the religious experience of the Hasidim of Eastern Europe, while at the same time rejecting their religious doctrines and commitment to the mitzvot (commandments) as mere obfuscation. Heschel, on the other hand, had started out with a full commitment to rabbinic Judaism; his 'discovery' was not of Hasidism, but of the new philosophies of the West, particularly the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl (1859-1938), modified by Max Scheler (1874- 1928), 3 which led him to reinterpret and positively re- evaluate traditional doctrine and the performance of the mitzvot , while emphasising the primary role of religious experience and social action. Edmund Husserl, a Moravian-born assimilated Jew who converted to Lutheranism in 1886, was in the vanguard of those who rejected as misguided and futile the traditional metaphysical undertaking of establishing the nature of reality through pure reason; there was in the future to be no transcendental metaphysics. He argued that the philosophical grounding even of logic and mathematics must commence with an analysis of the immediate experience - whether of sense-data or of relations and values - that is prior to all formal thinking. His watchword, Zu den Sachen selbst ('To the things themselves'), demanded an approach to reality free from conceptual presuppositions, and the attempt to describe actual experience as faithfully as possible. By the time Heschel arrived in Germany Husserl, then a professor at Freiburg, was probably the most influential philosopher in Germany. (As a matter of local interest, in 1922 he became the first German scholar after the war to be invited to lecture at the University of London.) Notwithstanding his formal conversion to Christianity, Husserl rejected any particular church creed, retaining respect for all 'authentic' religious belief, that is, belief conformable to actual European Judaism Volume 41 No. 1 Spring '08 5</page><page sequence="3">Heschel in the Context of Modern Jewish Religious Thought experience; the 'phenomenological reduction' he proposed was itself a kind of religious conversion. Not only philosophers, but Lutheran theologians helped to shape Heschel's interpretation of Judaism. This may be seen negatively, in his defensiveness with regard to performance of the commandments and to the value of good works and of the balance between justice and love, but also positively in his emphasis on the humanity of God, which is to some extent a transformation of Lutheran understanding of God's incarnation in Jesus. However, the strongest, if indirect, Lutheran influence on Heschel, as on most other German Jewish theologians including the neo-Orthodox Samson Raphael Hirsch, was that of Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768-1834), whose reconciliation of Christianity with culture rescued religion from the attacks of eighteenth-century sceptics.4 It was Schleiermacher, moreover, who demonstrated how Christianity could still make sense even in the face of biblical criticism: it did not matter if the Gospel accounts of the life of Jesus were inconsistent or if the Bible contained historical inaccuracies or other imperfections; such matters were not of the essence of religion, and it was necessary to develop a hermeneutic, based on correct historical contextualization of the texts, that would bring out that essence. Schleiermacher also absorbed from Jacobi the idea that people experience a sort of immediate intuition or feeling of God. God Heschel's philosophy of religion in general and of Judaism in particular is formulated in Man is Not Alone and God in Search of Man; the essential content of the two volumes is admirably arranged and presented by Fritz Rothschild in Between God and Man: An Interpretation of Judaism.5 Heschel courageously tackles the question of God,6 but which question? Certainly not the abstract question, does God exist? Not logical argument, but religious experience is Heschel's starting point. He writes: But how can we ever reach an understanding of Him who is beyond the mystery? How do we go from the intimations of the divine to a sense for the realness of God? Certainty comes about As a response of the whole person to the mystery and transcendence of living. As a response, it is an act of raising from the depths of the mind an ontological presupposition which makes that response intellectually understandable. 6 European Judaism Volume 41 No. 1 Spring '08</page><page sequence="4">Norman Solomon The meaning and verification of that ontological presupposition are attained in rare moments of insight. It is the mystery that evokes our religious concern, and it is the mystery where religious thinking must begin. The influence of Husserl on this is unambiguous. The starting point is the phenomenon, der Sack selbst , the thing itself, which is prior to all conceptualization; the phenomenon is the experience of wonder, mystery and the sublime. 'Raising from the depths of the mind an ontological presupposition which makes that response intellectually understandable' is precisely Husserl 's phenomenological reduction. Heschel's description of the experience of mystery and holiness draws strongly on the thinking of the influential Lutheran theologian Rudolf Otto (1869-1937), whose most famous work, The Idea of the Holy , was published in 1917 as Das Heilige - Über das Irrationale in der Idee des Göttlichen und sein Verhältnis zum Rationalen (The Holy - On the Irrational in the Idea of the Divine and its Relation to the Rational). Otto, who invented the term 'numinous' (Latin numen , 'deity'), explained it as a 'non-rational, non-sensory experience or feeling whose primary and immediate object is outside the self', a mystery (Latin: mystérium ) at the same time terrifying (tremendum) and fascinating (fascinans ). There are several problems for a philosophy that requires the articulation of a mystical experience. First, it is evident that people do not all have the same profound experiences. Jean-Paul Sartre, for instance, characterized the fundamental experience of the universe as akin to nausea, and Martin Heidegger as one of Nothingness. Even if people did have the same or analogous experiences, they might well offer different descriptions, since the words they use will be taken from the culture in which they are nurtured. Second, since the experience is by definition entirely private and unlike the sort of things language has evolved to communicate, it may, as is often claimed even by those who believe in its validity, lie beyond the capability of any language to convey. The principal problem, though, is how anyone can know whether the experience is simply the experience of some change in the central nervous system or is an experience of something outside the individual, and if of something outside the individual, whether that is something 'transcendent' - from 'beyond' the space-time universe as Heschel and other theologians claim. The Prophets In Man's Quest for God (1954) and God in Search of Man (1956) Heschel interpreted traditional Jewish sources, including those of mysticism and of the European Judaism Volume 41 No. 1 Spring '08 7</page><page sequence="5">Heschel in the Context of Modern Jewish Religious Thought Hasidism in which he was nurtured, to present a picture of a living, concerned God in intimate relationship with a fragile but noble humanity. This is in direct contradiction to the apophatic tradition of medieval Jewish philosophers, who deny that it is possible to predicate attributes of God, and interpret biblical anthropomorphisms as metaphors adapted to the inferior understanding of the multitude. Maimonides, for instance, on whom Heschel published a biographical study in German in 1935, emphatically condemns as a heretic anyone who ascribes emotions to God.7 Heschel, however, in The Prophets (1962), an elaboration of his PhD thesis, develops what he calls the 'philosophy of pathos' to justify the prophets' and his own speaking of God as having feelings and passions, and vigorously repudiates what he sees as the Greek philosophical doctrine of the impassivity of God which the mediaeval rationalists regarded as vital to true religious belief.8 Surely, though, 'anthropopathy' (ascribing human emotions to God)9 is as objectionable as anthropomorphism (ascribing human form to Him)? Heschel denies that the divine pathos, as expressed by the prophets, is anthropopathy: 'The error in regarding the divine pathos as anthropomorphism consisted in regarding a unique theological category as a common psychological concept.'10 'In the biblical expressions of divine emotions ... the religious consciousness experiences a sense of superhuman power rather than a conception of resemblance to man.' 1 1 God is perceived as transcendent, but the prophets have only human language in which to articulate this. Their apparent anthropomorphism is a pointer to the transcendent; it is an anthropomorphism to end all anthropomorphisms. What Heschel appears to be saying is that the overwhelming experience of God, an experience of transcendence, can be conveyed only in highly personal language. Metaphor is when you apply a name or descriptive term to an object to which it cannot be literally applied, as for instance if I say of a woman, 'She is a peach', or 'She is an angel'. But if I say of God, 'He is pleased' or 'He is angry' this is not, according to Heschel, a metaphor, but a pointer to a particular human experience of God. It is this focus on religious experience that sets Heschel at odds with the mediaevals. Maimonides, for instance, explains that the Bible's accounts of God's wrath towards idolatry are its way of denouncing a fundamentally false belief. The matter is presented in this anthropomorphic fashion so that even women and children, who are (in his view) of inferior understanding, get the point; and even they should be taught that the expressions are not to be understood literally.12 So, for Maimonides, 'God is pleased' and 'God is angry' refer not to my personal experience of God (he would probably have denied that people other than prophets have such an experience), but to God's absolute standards of truth and falsehood, right and wrong. 8 European Judaism Volume 41 No. 1 Spring '08</page><page sequence="6">Norman Solomon Clearly, Heschel has adopted some form of personalism, a philosophy traced back through Lotze to Leibniz and developed theologically by the American Methodist theologian Borden Parker Bowne (1847-1910), who in his Personalism (1908) maintained that God is a person and that all moral and ethical truth derives from the absolute value of the person. Some of HeschePs followers exceed him in rejecting the rationalist tradition. David J. Blumenthal, for instance, insists on the 'personality' (he rejects 'person/wo*/' as too abstract) of God: 'God, as understood by the personalist stream of the tradition and experience, is personal. So God too must have a character, sensitivities, an individual history and a moral capacity'.13 He lists God's 'personalist' attributes as: God is fair; God addresses, and can be addressed by, humankind; God is powerful but not perfect, is loving, gets angry, chooses and is partisan. One can, of course, generate powerful rhetoric and construct inspiring speeches using the image of a God who is powerful, irascible, moral and so on, and this is what the prophets of Israel frequently did. It appealed to the imaginations of the people they were talking to, though the people were not always persuaded to act as the prophets demanded. However, for the philosopher nagging problems remain. Is the 'ontological presupposition' to which such language allegedly points anything at all other than a fictional device designed to persuade people to behave in certain ways? In what way does the 'ontological presupposition' explain the universe as revealed by modern science? How does it relate to the specific claims of the religions to special revelation and authority? We are thrown back on just the sort of questions that the rationalists, the mediaevals, the metaphysicians were worrying about and that led them to say that the biblical way of talking about God was aimed at people who lacked the understanding to comprehend the ultimate truth. To dismiss such questions as 'arising from Greek philosophy' is not merely offensive to Greeks but as ludicrous as dismissing geometry or biology because they were developed by Greeks rather than ancient Israelites. Revelation Heschel writes: It is not historical curiosity that excites our interest in the problem of revelation. As an event of the past which subsequently affected the course of civilization, revelation would not engage the modern mind any more than the Battle of Marathon or the Congress of Vienna. If it concerns us, it is not because of the impact it had upon past generations but as something which may or may not be of perpetual, unabating relevance. In entering this discourse, we do not conjure up the shadow of an archaic European Judaism Volume 41 No. 1 Spring '08 9</page><page sequence="7">Heschel in the Context of Modern Jewish Religious Thought phenomenon, but attempt to debate the question whether to believe that there is a voice in the world that pleads with us in the name of God.14 In plain English, this means, 'Forget all that stuff about Moses on Mount Sinai and thunder and lightning and a voice proclaiming the Ten Commandments. It doesn't matter. What matters is whether, in your moments of profound mystical experience, you are stirred to turn towards God.' Clearly, during his sojourn in Berlin Heschel had been made aware of historical criticism of the Bible, and had abandoned the traditional naïve belief that the Hebrew scriptures were books literally dictated by God to a succession of prophets starting with Moses. In his own work on The Prophets he has little to say on biblical archaeology or on the detailed literary formation of the prophetic books. This is not, however, because he rejects historical criticism; he does, for instance, accept the critical redating of the later chapters of Isaiah. Rather, the finer details of historical criticism are irrelevant to his purpose, which is to bring to the fore the profound experience and contemporary relevance, particularly the social and political relevance, of the prophets of Israel. Reducing revelation to moments of profound mystery that anyone might experience, and that the Hebrew prophets experienced to a high degree, is rather like Buber's talk of the individual's encounter with God as 'thou'. Similar objections apply. Apart from the impossibility of establishing any objective criterion for its validity, revelation of this kind is by definition 'pre- conceptual'; any statement about it, like any statement about God, as Heschel freely admits, immediately removes you from the ineffable reality. Once you put revelation into words - like, for instance, the Ten Commandments - you have lost it. How can it give the individual who experiences it anything coherent to communicate to others? In his beautifully written Hebrew essay on Torah from Heaven he side- steps the historical account of revelation by emphasizing the concept of Oral Torah as an ongoing hermeneutic that reveals infinite meaning within the divine text;15 elsewhere he wrote, 'As a report about revelation, the Bible itself is Midrash'.16 Neil Gillman has explained: To characterize the entire Torah as a midrash is to say, in effect, that it is, in its entirety, a human understanding of a 'text' which, in its pristine, original form, is beyond human awareness ... It is a 'cultural' document because it preserves a human community's understanding of God's presence and will for that community, and that perception inevitably reflects the cultural conditions in which it was originally formulated. But it remains 'divine' because it is God's presence and will that the community insists it is perceiving.17 How does the community (in reality, a small part of it) know that it is perceiving God's presence and is not merely deluded? Heschel confronts this 10 European Judaism Volume 41 No. 1 Spring '08</page><page sequence="8">Norman Solomon difficulty: 'Unless history is a vagary of nonsense, there must be a counterpart to the immense power of man to destroy, there must be a voice that says NO to man, a voice not vague, faint and inward, like qualms of conscience, but equal in spiritual might to man's power to destroy.'18 The voice that says NO, or rather, the voice that lies beyond words, is articulated by the prophets. It is not, as a superficial reading of Heschel might suggest, the only voice of God in scripture. There is the 'still, small voice' that spoke to Elijah (1 Kings 19:12), there are wisdom writings, history, genealogies and law; passion has its place, but so do quiet reflection, wisdom and patient labour. Moreover, Kohelet probably did think that history was 'a vagary of nonsense' - 'Vanity of vanities, all is vanity' ( Ecclesiastes 1 :2). Philosophically, Heschel 's invocation of God to guarantee the integrity of history is rather like Kant's invocation of God to underwrite morals; it rests on a premise which itself is unproven. First show (Heschel) that history makes sense, or (Kant) that the categorical imperative holds good. If you cannot do this your argument is circular. You are saying, in effect, 'History makes sense because there is a God who controls it; there must be a God because otherwise history would not make sense'. If you could demonstrate that history made sense you would at least have a hypothesis to consider: 'History makes sense; this can be explained by the hypothesis that God controls it'. The argument would not then be circular, but neither the premise nor the hypothesis is easily demonstrable. Law What does Heschel have to say about law, which is certainly a fundamental concept in rabbinic Judaism? In contrast with Buber, he does not abandon the law; but nor, like Joseph Ber Soloveitchik, does he elevate halakha (law) to the status of the immutable essence of Torah to which all else is reducible. In Judaism allegiance to God involves a commitment to Jewish law, to a discipline, to specific obligations . . . Reverence for the authority of the law is an expression of our love for God . . . The order of Jewish living is meant to be, not a set of rituals but an ordering of all man's existence, shaping all his traits, interests and dispositions ... the belonging to an order in which single deeds, aggregates of religious feeling, sporadic sentiments, moral episodes become a part of a complete pattern.19 This is not an unlimited commitment to the whole panoply of mitzvot as developed by the rabbis: In their zeal to carry out the ancient injunction, 'make a hedge about the Torah,' many rabbis failed to heed the warning, 'Do not consider the European Judaism Volume 41 No. 1 Spring '08 11</page><page sequence="9">Heschel in the Context of Modern Jewish Religious Thought hedge more important than the vineyard.' Excessive regard for the hedge may well spell ruin for the vineyard ... 'Were the Torah given as a rigid immutable code of laws, Israel could not survive . . . Moses exclaimed: Lord of the universe, let me know what is the law. And the Lord said: Rule by the principle of the majority ... The law will be explained, now one way, now another, according to the perception of the majority of the sages.'20 Clearly, Heschel is prepared to criticize and modify the halakhic tradition in the light of evolving social values; law is rooted in specific societies, and tradition affords a mechanism - majority voting among the sages - to keep it abreast of society. Soloveitchik, on the other hand, sets halakha apart from society, as constituting an independent a priori realm that confronts and bridges the opposing worlds of science and religion. When Halakhic Man approaches the real world, he comes with his Torah, given to him on Sinai, in his hand. He connects himself to the world through fixed laws and through principles cast in a mould . . . armed with his statutes, laws, principles and judgements in a priori fashion . . . What is this like? It is like a mathematician who forms an ideal world and utilises it to determine a relationship between himself and the real world . . . The nature of halakha which he has received from the Holy One, blessed be He! is the creation of an ideal world, and the recognition of the relationship which prevails between it and the real world. There is no phenomenon . . . which a priori halakha does not approach with its ideal measuring rod . . . When Halakhic Man stumbles upon a spring of water ... he has an a priori relationship with this phenomenon in the real world ... he aspires to harmonise the a priori concept with the a posteriori phenomenon.21 Soloveitchik, in real life, exercised humanity and compassion in his interpretation of the law, but there is no doubt that his philosophy suggests 'a rigid immutable code of laws'; Heschel's characterization of Soloveitchik's philosophy as 'pan-halakhism' gains even more strength from Soloveitchik's attempts to reduce the whole Torah, even its narrative portions, to halakha. Theodicy The problem of theodicy (though not the word, which was coined by Leibniz) is an ancient one; it arose on the day God failed to intervene to save Abel from being murdered by Cain. If God is benevolent and all-powerful, why does He permit evil to exist? As Epicurus (341-270 ВСЕ) himself put it: God either wishes to take away evils and is unable; or he is able and is unwilling; or he is neither willing nor able; or he is both willing and able. 12 European Judaism Volume 41 No. 1 Spring '08</page><page sequence="10">Norman Solomon If he is willing but unable he is feeble, which is not in accordance with the character of God. If he is able and unwilling, he is envious, which is equally at variance with God. If he is neither willing nor able, he is both envious and feeble, and therefore not God. If he is both willing and able, which alone is suitable for God, from what source then are evils? Or why does he not remove them?22 To Zoroastrians this was not a problem. A demonic Power existed, inferior to God but strong enough to cause trouble; until the final triumph of Ahura Mazda, the supreme God, the demonic forces of Angra Mainyu would remain in the world and good and evil would be mixed.23 Though belief in Two Powers was firmly rejected by Jews and Christians, the notion of good and evil existing together in the world eventually penetrated mystical circles and is preserved in the Jewish Kabbala. Heschel, as a holocaust survivor, was acutely aware of the existence of evil, and turned to Kabbala for consolation: 'The dreadful confusion, the fact that there is nothing in this world that is not a mixture of good and evil, of holy and unholy ... is, according to Jewish mysticism, the central problem of history and the ultimate issue of redemption. The confusion goes back to the very process of creation.'24 But this is not an answer to the problem. If you ask, 'Why does God permit evil?', to say 'Good and evil will be mixed until the Messiah comes' fails to explain why evil is here in the first place. Heschel appears to sense this, and shifts the ground of discussion: 'Evil is not man's ultimate problem. Man's ultimate problem is his relationship to God. Evil entered history as a result of man's disobedience ... The Biblical answer to evil is not the good but the holy . . . The seductiveness of vice is excelled by the joy of the mitzvah.'25 Holocaust theology as a genre was developed in the 1970s by Fackenheim, Berkovits and others, though earlier writers such as Ignaz Maybaum had boldly addressed the issues. Heschel 's shifting of the ground from an abstract theological question to the existential one of 'How, in this situation, do we retain the sense of living with God?' was shared by many Holocaust theologians. Indeed, it is entirely at one with the simple faith of those who entered the gas chambers with Ani Ma ' amin or Shema Israel on their lips; what was happening defied their understanding, but their faith triumphed over evil and they were ready to lay down their lives as qiddush Has hem, the 'sanctification of the name of God'. It is not a rational answer to the question of why God lets bad things happen to good people, but perhaps there is none. Heschel clearly does not accept the traditional answer that the suffering is the consequence of our sin, nor is he concerned to take up the question of redress in a future life. European Judaism Volume 41 No. 1 Spring '08 13</page><page sequence="11">Heschel in the Context of Modern Jewish Religious Thought Conclusion A social activist, Heschel expressed his religious-ethical concerns through participation in the American civil rights and antiwar movements, marching together with Martin Luther King Jr. He involved himself deeply in interfaith activities between Jews and Christians and in 1964 advocated to Pope Paul VI the need for a Catholic declaration on relations with Jews. He was the first rabbi to be appointed to the faculty of the Protestant Union Theological Seminary in New York, where he was able to engage in fruitful dialogue with the eminent German Protestant theologian Paul Tillich (1886-1965), who had been barred from German universities already in 1933 on account of his opposition to Nazism - the first non-Jewish academician 4o be so honoured', as he wryly put it. Tillich 's contention that all spiritual and theological knowledge cannot be other than a symbol and that faith is the state of being ultimately concerned is indeed very close to Heschel's own outlook, and draws on much the same religious and philosophical heritage. Heschel's public activities, his extraordinary gifts as a communicator, and his inspirational teaching at the Jewish Theological Seminary were the flesh that gave life to the intellectual achievement of his philosophy of religion. In purely Jewish terms, that philosophy defined a position that rejected the fundamentalism of modern Orthodoxy on the one hand and the vague liberalism of Reform on the other. In more general terms, he gave expression to the twentieth-century rejection of abstract metaphysics in favour of an existential focus on human experience. Notes 1.
