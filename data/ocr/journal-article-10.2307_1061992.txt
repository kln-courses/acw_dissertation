<plain_text><page sequence="1">Furio Jesi T HE THRACIAN HERAKLES The documented presence of a cult of Herakles on the islands of the Thracian Sea and on Thasos in particular (where the systematic re- search of the French Archeological School has produced the discovery of the Herakleion) has brought into discussion the origin and genesis of the image of the hero-god, with regard not only to that distinct cul- tural region, but also to the confrontations of the views on the subse- quent developments of the cult of Herakles in the Greek world.' Translated from the Italian by Benjamin Egli. 1 The bibliography on Herakles is extremely rich. Of all the interpretations of this figure, we have limited ourselves to discussing only those based on a solid historical and archeological foundation. Let us keep in mind, then, that in the past many scholars have argued in favor of the Doric origin of Herakles of Thasos in accordance with the well-known theory of K. O. Miiller according to which Herakles would be the emblematic hero of the Doric race (U. von Wilamowitz- Moellendorff, Euripides Herakles [2d ed.; 1895], p. 20; 0. Gruppe, Griechische My- thologie und Religionsgeschichte [1906], I, 220; Pauly-Wissowa, Real-Encyclopddie der klassischen Altertumswissenschaft, Suppl. III, col. 964; P. Friedlaender, "Hera- kles, Sagengeschichtliche Untersuchungen," Philolog. Untersuchungen, XIX [1907], 4-13; W. Vollgraff, "Rhodos oder Argos? Zur Entwicklungsgeschichte der Hera- klessage," Neue Jahrbucher fur das klassische Altertum, XXV [1910], 305-17). The hypothesis of a Herakles originally Doriac and especially of an exclusively Doriac origin of Herakles seems, however, untenable in the light of a more serious in- vestigation of the many forms of the Greek cult of Herakles and of its stages of development (cf. G. R. Levy, "The Oriental Origin of Herakles," Journal of Hellenic Studies [1934], pp. 40-53; M. Launey, Le Sanctuaire et le culte d'Herakles a Thasos [Paris, 1944], pp. 189 ff.; H. Goldman, "Sandon and Herakles," Hesperia, Suppl. VIII [1949], pp. 164-74. 261</page><page sequence="2">The Thracian Herakles With regard to the origin of this cult on Thasos, there are two theories presented by the scholars. The first, acknowledging, in a sense, the tradition (Herodotus, Pausanias), sees in Herakles of Thasos the fusion of a deity imported to the island by Anatolian im- migrants (the "Phoenicians" of Herodotus) with an analogical figure not of a divine character but of a heroic one ('HpaKXrS KaXXlvLKos) as conceived by those settlers of Paros who landed on Thasos about 720 B.C. and took roots there.2 The identification of the two figures (with the distinction being maintained that the cult was both divine and heroic) would seem perfectly acceptable also from the viewpoint of the political interests as it justified and almost sanctified the Parian colonization of Thasos. On the island, the Parians might have found a deity analogous to a minor heroic figure of their own religious system and would have furthered his cult in order to encourage the fusion of the new territory with the mother country. The second theory, which is more skeptical concerning the tradi- tional ethnic designation of the cult as being "Phoenician,"3 rather sees the immigrants who introduced the cult of Herakles into Thasos as Cretan settlers.4 This theory would then support the idea that there was a fusion of the major Minoan divinity with the hero of Paros. This second theory, however, is in contradiction with the arche- ological evidence for the reason that nothing on Thasos seems to document a Cretan colonization.6 Even if, hypothetically, the Cretans succeeded in establishing themselves on the island their settlement must have been altogether impermanent and very limited in time such that no material traces were left behind. On the other hand, the influence of Anatolia on Thasos can be widely documented from an archeological viewpoint as far back as 1500 B.C. (the date proposed by Herodotus), and it seems, therefore, that there are no serious difficul- ties in recognizing the traditional "Phoenicians" as Anatolian immi- grants.6 This being so, we consider it necessary to clarify the fact that even the supporters of the first, more reliable theory seem to overlook an element of fundamental importance. Even if we admit that, in 1500 2 Launey, op. cit., pp. 191-219. C. Friedrich has furthermore maintained an exclusively Parian origin of the cult of Herakles on Thasos (Inscriptiones Graecae, XII [1909], 8, 76-77). His position, however, cannot explain the "Phoenician" aspects which the tradition has attributed to Herakles. 3 C. Autran, Ph6niciens, [1920], pp. 1-3. 4Ch. Picard, Bulletin de correspondance hellenique, XLVII (1923); 258-74. 6 Launey, op. cit., pp. 205-6. 6 Ibid., pp. 207 ff. 262</page><page sequence="3">B.C., the Anatolian immigrants had introduced to Thasos the cult of a deity in which the Greeks later came to recognize Herakles, the task remains to establish what kind of religious conditions were in existence before the arrival of these immigrants, that is, what the possible indigenous Thracian contribution to the genesis of the cult of Her- akles was.7 The persistence of Thracian elements was the object of H. Seyrig's inquiries.8 It is, furthermore, significant that the Parian settlers who reached Thasos about 720 B.C. found Thracians on the island and not "Phoenicians";9 Thracians, however, who had apparently kept the "Phoenician" cult of Herakles in its original forms. On Thasos, moreover, Herakles appears in forms which partially coincide with the classical tradition (and that are subject to innumer- able parallels), and partially are totally new. Actually, the forms are new inasmuch as they are applied to Herakles, but not new in respect to their appearance (this latter is foreign to the figure of Herakles) in the Greek mythical heritage. At this point, we have to be more specific. On Thasos, Herakles ap- pears in the form of an archer, a protector, rarely connected with the legend attributed to him in the Greek tradition.10 As to his known rep- resentations as conqueror of the Nemean lion,1 as winner of the apples of the Hesperides,l2 as victor over the birds of the Stymphalian lake'3 and over the Centaurs,14 these constitute an exception; almost all the 7 In the field of the studies on the origins of the Greek religious institutions, we think that the continuing appraisal of the original indigenous cultural substratum (which precedes the various colonizations) must not be neglected. It is this aspect that will essentially guide this study and will serve as instrumental presupposition for a subsequent synthetical understanding of the most ancient, pre-Mycenaean civilization. 8 BCH, LI (1927), 198-219; cf. Launey, op. cit., p. 206, n. 3. 9 Launey, op. cit., p. 218 (with references to Archilochus). Also, from the view- point of the most ancient archeological evidences, Thasos shows a direct relation- ship to the Thracian culture and, by way of extension, to the Balcanic culture of the Neolithic age. 10 Herakles as archer and protector on the bas-relief of the famous door in the circle of walls on Thasos.

In this sense even the fragments of Archilochus referring to the usual undertakings in the myth of Herakles have limited documentary value inasmuch as "nous savons le poete trop nourri de souvenirs 6piques et mythologiques pour affirmer qu'il ne reproduit ici que des legendes ayant cours a Thasos."'5 Much more significant is the presence on Thasos of some attributes of the figure of Herakles which, in other places, are usually foreign to it. At this point we would stress the fact that, on the island, a divine cult and a heroic one were offered to Herakles; but this phenomenon in itself is not new at all, being documented with regard to other Greek cultic places (double cult of either Anatolian or Minoan origin). Rather, what attracts one's attention is the connection on Thasos be- tween Herakles and an image of a winged horse. This connection can clearly be illustrated on the basis of the discovery of the Herakleion. We might recall the image (rxporo,4i) of the pseudo-portico (Xiax7-) representing a winged horse, and the terra cottas on which a bearded male figure on a winged horse is repeatedly shown, sometimes in- volved in a fight with a chimera.'6 This frequent reappearance of images in the sanctuary itself seems to deny them a purely decorative function. On the other hand, the cycle of the mythical adventures that grew around Herakles according to the classical tradition includes no episodes in which the hero appears with a winged horse. This does not mean, however, that the early non-Greek iconography does not support a certain relation between Herakles and the winged horse, however little the literary texts may contribute to clarifying the significance of such a connection. M. Launey cites some examples of such representations: an Etruscan mirror discovered near Cortona and representing a young man (designated by the name HERCLE) with a non-winged horse (PAKSTE) ;17 another Etruscan mirror with the figure of a man subduing a winged horse, and the symbols of the bow and of the club;18 some Campanian coins with the head of Herakles, Pegasus and the club, etc. The first mirror mentioned explicitly names the horse: PAKSTE, a name which we could recognize as the Greek "Pegasus."'9 Pegasus, in- 15 Ibid., p. 151 (fragment of Archilochus: 48 Bgk; 139, 147-181, etc.). 16 Ibid., p. 151. 17 J. de Witte, Gazette archeologique, V (1879), 217-21.

And Pegasus, like his rider Bellerophon, would seem to turn the in- vestigation eastward, toward Lycia in particular. This element would support the hypothesis of an Anatolian origin of the Herakles of Thasos, who would, thus, have kept the attributes of a primitive Anatolian myth and cult, which penetrated the Greek world also in the guise of Bellerophon. To this must be added some documents giving a connection between the Herakles of Thasos and Perseus, which con- nection is admissible in the framework of an original Anatolian Her- akles rTOTVLOS 06rpwv to whom "on ait donne pour escorte d'autres vainqueurs de monstres, Persee et Bellerophon."20 This theory, however, has no conclusive value. Undoubtedly, it strongly supports an Anatolian influence in the cult of Herakles on Thasos and presents, in the element of the winged horse, one of the formal manifestations of the influence itself. We are not, however, in- vestigating the problem of a possible existence of such an element on the island before the Anatolian influence, which-by way of hypoth- esis-might have had the function of reaffirmation (and partial alteration) of already existing motifs instead of the one of innovation. We may, then, investigate whether such a hypothesis is based on some historical foundation. There is no doubt, first of all, that the image of the horse is characteristic of the most ancient Thracian re- ligious thought.21 To this, furthermore, is added the image of the Chimera in the decoration of the Herakleion and, in apparent con- formity with the tradition, the image of the Gorgon.22 The Chimera and the Gorgon are elements of a very ancient Greek cultural milieu in which the horse appears also, and in direct relation to those monstrous images (which will make the attribute of the wings more easily understandable, thus clarifying the nature of such a relation). cols. 1748-52, 1902-9); L.

We might recall the myth of Arcadia, recounting the violent wedding of Demeter with Zeus that the goddess underwent in the form of a horse. To this myth is con- nected the image in the Arcadian cave of Phigalia representing De- meter Melaina, who had the head of a horse with "snakes and other animals attached."23 However, such an image does not seem to express the prerogatives of any of the divine figures merged in the image of Demeter, and yet it cannot be explained by a late alteration inasmuch as it seems directly connected with the pattern of the wrath of the goddess.24 In addition, its nature leads us to connect it with an element of particularly ancient origin: the Gorgon. Following the description of Pausanias already mentioned ("There were snakes and other animals attached to the head of the horse"), Pausanias does not elaborate on the latter. He mentions, however, that the attributes of Demeter Melaina were a dolphin, a bird, and presumably a dove. Now it is precisely the snake and the birds, together with the lion, that are the original constituents of the head of the Gorgon,25 who, moreover, is represented with the body of a horse in an archaic image of the killing of Medusa.26 The parallel between Demeter and the Gorgon is strengthened by the fact that the latter was also held to be the wife of Poseidon, and her marriage to the god was analogous to that of Demeter in the equine form.27 After this marriage Demeter had given birth to a kore and the horse Areion; analogously the Gorgon had given birth to Pegasus, the winged horse, and to a mysterious being, Chrysaor, whose name was the epithet of Demeter Chrysaor. We may therefore accept the existence of a close relationship be- tween the Gorgon and Demeter which includes the image of the horse. This relationship, however, does not express the entire figure of the 23 Pausanias, VIII, 25, 42 (cf. K. Kerenyi, Einfuhrung in das Wesen der My- thologie, trans. A. Brelich [Turin, 1948], pp. 179 ff.). 24 Cult of Demeter Erinys. 26 L. Frobenius, Kulturgeschichte Afrikas. Prolegomena zu einer historischen Gestaltlehre, trans. C. Bovero (Turin, 1950), p. 144; F.

Ker6nyi, op. cit. 27 Pausanias, VIII, 25, 42. 266</page><page sequence="7">Mistress of Eleusis: To what particular aspect of her personality might it then refer? As we have noted, the analogies between Demeter and the Gorgon are practically limited to the cult of the Melaina of Phigalia and of the Erinys of Thelpusa, in which Demeter appears as the violated one and the one enraged by the violence suffered. The study of the genesis of the Eleusinian cult shows that the violated one and the enraged one are originally two different figures; one is contained in the very nature of every kore; the other is the aspect assumed by the mother goddess at the moment in which she is reunited with the Mycenaean kore in the first form of the Eleusinian cult. The fact that these appear to be fused in Demeter Melaina (in whom the wrath of having been robbed of her daughter is united with the rage resulting from her sexual violation) must therefore be considered with particular attention. That may de- pend, in fact, on the same circumstance which has led Demeter to assume characteristics of the Gorgon or vice versa. To identify the remote cause of these phenomena, we have to re- member that not only Demeter but also Kore appears in certain re- spects analogous to the Gorgon. Earlier Wilamowitz supposed that the name of Persephoneia (in Homer), or Perrephatta (in the Attic dialect) is connected with the name of the killer of the Gorgon and that it could be interpreted as "the one killed by Perseus."28 This connection is then confirmed, as Karl Kerenyi remarks,29 by the fact that Perseus is an infernal figure; he carries the helmet of Hades which bestows invisibility, the most significant of all the infernal elements. At Lerna, Perseus was explicit- ly identified with Hades and, as such, forced Dionysus into the swamps which alludes, as the evidence shows, to the infernal regions.30 Similar considerations, together with the link between the head of the Gorgon and Persephone in her function as queen of the infernal regions, which is also mentioned in Homer, enable us to state that the religion of archaic and classical Greece conceived the existence of a relationship between the figure of the enraged one (Demeter Erinys), of the violated one (Demeter Erinys and Kore) and the Gorgon. We have to add, furthermore, that from the study of the most ancient images of the Gorgon we recognize its direct connection with an ancient figure of Artemis.3' Such a connection, however, brings us 28 U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorf, Der Glaube der Hellenen (Berlin, 1931), I, pp. 108 ff. 29 Cf. n. 26. 30 C.

Indeed, Artemis appears from one side as kore, as parthenos,32 as dancer, connected with the moon; from the other side as mistress of the animals and also as mother (Kovporp6oos),33 reaching the climax of this maternal function in her many-breasted Ephesian image. A famous representation of the Gorgon r6rvLa 0r7pPv34 shows, furthermore, the monster with the wings of Nemesis; that very Nemesis of whom the violent rape by Zeus35 is recounted and who therefore appears in many respects analogous to Demeter and to the Gorgon, wife of Poseidon. Nemesis, too, when pursued by Zeus, as- sumed the form of an animal, transforming herself into beings of the earth, sea, and air, and, finally, into the form of a wild goose, had forced union with the god, giving birth later to a Helena. The very name of the goddess referred to her character as enraged avenger of the violence suffered. Even though she seems to be connected with these divine figures, the Gorgon does still not reveal much more about her nature than what her relationship with the Eleusinian goddesses has already clari- fied. All we can find is that the concept of the Eleusinian cult, in certain cases, was partially applied to other divine figures, too, which in cer- tain respects had to be analogous to the Mistresses of Eleusis. Further- more, we have learned that the Gorgon was represented by an image of the mistress of the animals, and this image was therefore indirectly included in the relationship between the Gorgon and the figures of the enraged one and of the violated one. This relationship implied, on the one hand, the identification of sexual rape and murder, and, on the other hand, the fusion into one figure of the enraged one and of the violated one, where the wrath be- came wrath because of the sexual violation. All these independent elements merged in the image of the Gorgon who was at the same time the enraged one and the violated one, the violated one and the killed one. A similar assertion formulated like that could, however, lead to 32 And as such she is the companion of Kore at the moment of the rape of the latter near the lake of Pergusa (cf. Homeric hymn to Artemis, 424, and the respec- tive passages in Allen-Sikes, The Homeric Hymns [London, 1904]; L. Malten, Archiv far Religionswissenschaft, XII [1909], 422ff.; Odyssey, VI, 106). The identification of Artemis and Kore is hinted at by Aeschylus and Callimachus (cf. Herodotus, II, 156; Schneider, Callimachea, II, 197 ff.). 33 Regarding the relations between Kore and Kovporp6oqos, cf. F. Jesi, "Iside in figura di Kore?"

Mnemosyne (1939), pp. 162 ff. 268</page><page sequence="9">error. If, in fact, all these images assumed anthropomorphic character- istics in the figures of the Eleusinian goddesses, thus becoming really "the enraged one," "the violated one," "the killed one," represented by the Gorgon, these were only "being enraged," "being violated," and "being killed." In other words, the image of the Gorgon was the abstract symbol of all these qualities, all equally sacred and terrible. The anthropomorphism of the Gorgon is indeed a rather ambiguous fact. She is a head in which animal elements are joined together to form a hybrid anthropomorphism, neither masculine nor feminine.36 The bodies on which this head is fixed not do usually have any im- portance (even if in some cases the horse element is documented), and in most cases they lack some characteristic trait thus also appearing to be neither masculine nor feminine. How did this image get to be a symbol of the terrifying elements which we have mentioned? To understand this, we have to realize that in the face of the Gorgon three elements of documented antiquity merge: the lion, the serpent, the bird-elements that also appear in the image of the sphinx and in that of the griffin, these, too, being relatively ancient. We deliberately mention these two monstrous images, for a study by Andr6 Dessenne37 has posed the problem of their nature in Greece in such a way as to elucidate indirectly the character and genesis of the Gorgon. Dessenne has in fact demonstrated that, among the two images, the one of the griffin was accepted much more favorably in the Cretan world; and this above all because the Cretans, still having formulated the images of a number of hybrid Geniuses, alongside their own gods and god- desses of human form "aient repugne a utiliser pour cela le visage de l'homme, sans doute parce que c'etait celui des dieux, et aussi bien, chez les dieux comme chez les mortels, la partie noble du corps. Les Demons minoens, dont le r81e dans le culte est nettement marqu6 comme subalterne, sont constitues exactement a l'inverse des demons orientaux: homme a tete de taureau, de cerf ou d'ane, femme a tete d'oiseau ou de chevre."38 This resulted in the ready reception of the griffin, which is a fusion of a lion and a bird of prey, and in the rejec- tion of the sphinx, a human face on an animal body. On the basis of this norm mentioned in the last paragraph it seems easy to reject a Cretan origin of the gorgoneia which also appear some- 36 Cf.

II, 203-15. 38 Ibid., p. 209. 269</page><page sequence="10">The Thracian Herakles times on Crete.39 Consider the image of the Gorgon that has come to us on a Cretan seal (from Zakro) on which is shown a fantastic animal, winged, with the paws of a lion and a human head.40 This head, crowned with unkempt locks which could also be interpreted as ser- pents, is really structurally analogous to the one of the Gorgon which appears in the archaic and classical monuments. Moreover, we would be on unsure ground in supposing an Eastern origin of the Gorgon, given the lack of direct parallels belonging to the Eastern world and that can be attributed to a period immediately pre- ceding MM III. We might remember in fact that on the image of the seal of Zakro she does not simply appear with a human head on an animal body but with a true and proper head of the Gorgon although showing characteristics more anthropomorphic than the ones found in the monuments of subsequent periods. We are, therefore, confronted with the figure of the Gorgon already constituted, presumably neither of Oriental nor of Cretan origin. All this confirms the hypothesis of the Greek, peninsular, pre- Mycenaean origin of the Gorgon herself, and this hypothesis is strong- ly supported by the presence on the peninsula of the constitutive ele- ments (lion, serpent, bird41), by the relationship between the horse (Greek, peninsular and, above all, Thracian element) and the Gorgon, and by the fact that the horse-Gorgon relationship becomes more pre- cise also in the confrontations between the goddesses connected with the symbolic function of the Gorgon herself: most important of all, the enraged Demeter. We find the connection between the horse and the Gorgon also, as we have already noted, in the decoration of the Herakleion of Thasos inasmuch as it is made ambiguous by the tradition which almost re- quired the appearance of the image of the Gorgon in the friezes of the cult buildings. One ought to remember, however, that, if the decora- tion of the Herakleion in itself does not directly show a horse-Gorgon relationship, which is foreign to the formal tradition of the archi- tectural friezes, it clearly documents a horse-chimera relationship. The Chimera constituted in a certain sense the equivalent of the Gorgon, at least in the view of the seventh-century Greeks, as in their understanding it belonged to the same very old period in which the 39 F.

Thus, turn- ing back to the preliminary assumption of our investigation, we can identify in this pre-Mycean religious milieu-in which the Thracian culture seems to participate directly--the substratum on which the probable Anatolian influences relating to the cult of Herakles on Thasos around 1500 B.C. acted. One more element now remains which we have to consider more closely and which is of fundamental im- portance, that is, which traits in the image of Herakles-god or hero- have to be shown as going back to the described Thracian milieu of the second millennium. In this regard, the documents of the cult of Thasos seem to furnish more than one significant element. On Thasos, in fact, Herakles pre- sents himself with the explicit characteristics of an infernal deity, sub- ject to a cult analogous to the mysteries. In this guise, moreover, he appears to be directly connected with Dionysus, the other godhead in whose person we recognize many elements of Thracian origin (if not a totally Thracian origin as a number of scholars have supposed in the past). Here again,the study by Launey of the cult of Herakles on Thasos becomes quite useful. With the help of an impressive number of docu- ments, the author works out the Herakles-Dionysus relation with all its consequences, including the attribution to Herakles of an infernal character which is apparently hidden in the classical tradition relating to the hero.43 Above all, we ought to note that on Thasos, topographically, the territory relating to Herakles borders on that of Dionysus and is in direct relation to it, which fact is demonstrated by the figures on the gates in this area (Seilenos, who is Dionysiac, in the territory of 42 The constituents of the Chimera of Thasos are precisely the lion, the goat, and the serpent (cf. Launey, Le Sanctuaire et le culte . . ., pp. 43 ff.). We do not maintain, on the other hand, that the iconography of the Chimera depends on a pre-Mycenaean Greek tradition. Rather, the monster must have appeared in rela- tively recent periods (seventh century B.C.) in analogy to those monstrous figures which, like the Gorgon, had lost their original significance and assumed another. Only in this respect may we consider the Chimera analogous to the Gorgon. 43 Launey, Le Sanctuaire et le culte . . , pp. 153 ff. 271</page><page sequence="12">The Thracian Herakles Herakles; Dionysus and Herakles the archer; Bacchian thiasos; birth of Dionysus), and by Caracalla's triumphal arch which constitutes the solemn entrance to the Dionysiac Telesterion and which is decorated with a statue of Herakles or of Caracalla figured as Herakles. The same Herakles-Dionysus association is also documented by coins of Thasos. Launey rightly notes that the direct Herakles-Dionysus relation- which is certainly not fortuitous-has a particular significance since on Thasos, Herakles was, from antiquity, a god and not merely a hero who eventually acquired divinity. Herakles' participation in the Dionysiac banquet appears, in fact, as a symbol "d'une immortalit6 differente de celle que lui confere son admission dans l'Olympe"; an immortality which, to the Thasians, would more likely seem to be "un droit naturel d'Herakles, s'il est vrai qu'ayant toujours ete dieu il n'avait pas besoin de conquerir l'immortalite," from which one may conclude that "ainsi sa presence [of Herakles] aupres de Dionysos venait-elle, non seulement d'une sympathie de leurs natures, mais d'une identite de fonctions."44 This identity of functions seems to be explicitly documented by the banquets celebrated in honor of Herakles in the garden belonging to him, adjacent to the Herakleion and inclosed-like the places of mystery cults-by high walls: "quand Herakles invite dans son jardin certains de ses fideles a des banquets, ce n'est pas seulement pour leur faire bonne chere. Dieu cette fois, il offre un festin d'immortalite, un de ces repas rituels ou une manducation en commun cree un lien entre la divinite et le fidele, et assure a ce dernier des garanties precieuses pour le voyage et le sejour dans l'au-dela."45 It would seem to us erroneous, moreover, to exclude the survival of infernal traits even in some images of Herakles that belong to the Greek classical tradition. Above all, we want to draw attention to the function fulfilled by Herakles in receiving Alcestis, which shows the hero penetrating Hades and returning to the world of mortals in a function which is exactly opposed to that of the vxorTO7ro.-s. Herakles takes Alcestis away from the infernal world, enters the Beyond, and returns from it the same as Orpheus did fruitlessly. Usually, however, the heroes of the classical tradition (preceding pos- sible assumption into Olympus) do not have the faculty of crossing the thresholds of the hereafter, returning without difficulty to the world of mortals; this prerogative belongs rather to the gods and in particu- lar to the infernal ones. This seems to suggest the re-emergence in the image of Herakles 44 Ibid., p. 156. 46 Ibid., p. 157. 272</page><page sequence="13">acting in the rescue of Alcestis of his character as infernal deity which is documented in the cult of Thasos. The theme of the restoration of Alcestis to her husband Admetus seems to be more a literary than an originally mythical trait,46 since it seems to have no direct relationship to any cultic institution or religious doctrine. Orpheus' fruitless at- tempt, documented in analogous forms by a vast ethnographical litera- ture, seems to be connected with the didactic intention of underlining the profound separation that exists between the realm of the living and the realm of the dead,47 the impossibility for a man to enter into direct contact with a being of the Beyond (direct contact means something analogous to what Odysseus recognizes as missing when, in his veKvLa, he does not succeed in embracing his mother). The genesis of the episode of Alcestis is, therefore, presumably of literary nature, implying a certain profane derivation-and relative alteration-of the myth of Orpheus. But the fact that it is Herakles who rescues Alcestis from the infernal world could refer to an original infernal prerogative of the hero-god, of whom the traditional memory made especially suited for a task of this kind. A similar hypothesis would also lead us to suppose that Euripides, in accepting and reassert- ing the forms of the legend, had respect for a fairly old religious orthodoxy and which was, therefore, distant enough from that of his own epoch to justify the claim of his being a religious skeptic with regard to the religiosity of his times. Regarding this, we wish to draw the reader's attention to a passage of the Euripidean tragedy, and more specifically to the scene in which Herakles gives Alcestis back to Admetus. Alcestis is veiled, and Herakles presents her to Admetus as if she were a woman to substitute for the wife Admetus has lost. Admetus refuses, stating that he wants to be true to Alcestis, even dead; he refuses to remove her veil and to look at the face of one whom he be- lieves to be an unknown woman. Similarly, he first refuses to guide the woman into the place when Herakles asks him to do so. This refusal, however, is overcome by the hero's insistence. Admetus finally takes the woman by the hand, ropyvzO' W KaparotZJv,48 even believing her to be the Gorgon and therefore presumably turning away his face. 46 Cf. K. Dissel, Der Mythos von Admetos und Alkestis (Brandenburg, 1882).

Murray, 1118; also Kaparo6/y (codd. et 2 = scholiorum testi- monium). 273</page><page sequence="14">The Thracian Herakles Herakles then removes the veil from the woman whom Admetus finally recognizes as Alcestis. The scene itself seems to develop according to a traditional theatri- cal pattern with explicit dramatic intent. Some considerations, how- ever, can lead us to recognize in its development the traces of a ritual, or at least of an hypothetical ritual inspired by a precise religious concept. Admetus' repeated refusal to have anything to do with the veiled woman (who, as we know, has come from the infernal world) seems to assert that, for a mortal being, it is impossible to enter into contact with a being from the Beyond. If this hypothesis is valid, it would imply that the theme had undergone a kind of literary revision which could be either the inevitable consequence of its being outdated and unclearly understood or a means of hiding its ritual significance, or else to render more vivid, for the course of the drama, a religious institu- tion which had by that time been abandoned. Which one of these solutions has most validity will be discussed later; for the moment it may suffice to note that, however the problem of the literary reversion of the motive may be solved, this motive seems to be analogous to that of the unsuccessful attempt of Orpheus. In the classical versions of the Orpheus myth, too, it seems that a cer- tain literary re-elaboration has intervened to "justify" the fact that Orpheus is unable to bring Eurydice back on earth; to show this im- possibility was the original didactic purpose of the episode. This does not, of course, exclude the possibility that it had also been conceived in its oldest form around the pre-existing figure of a being capable of passing from the realm of the living to that of the dead and vice versa. As an example of such a being we recognize Orpheus who-not foreign to the Thracian religious milieu49-appears thus to be analo- gous to the primitive Herakles of Thasos. The relationship between the episode of Orpheus and that of Alcestis, seems, moreover, to be confirmed by an element of the "restoration" scene in the Euripidean tragedy, that is, by the fact that Admetus, when taking the woman by the hand, turns away his head and also his eyes from her veiled face as from the petrifying head of the Gorgon. He thus seems to keep himself to the rule imposed upon Orpheus for the voyage of the latter back from Hades to earth, that is, never to turn his eyes toward Eurydice before reaching the realm of the living. Like Orpheus, Admetus must not take possession of Alcestis by looking at her before she ceases to belong to the Beyond. If, in the 49 Pettazzoni, La religione nella Grecia antica (Turin, 1954), p. 110. Cf. J. Coman, "Zalmoxis et Orphee," Serta Kazaroviana (Sofia, 1950), pp. 177-84. 274</page><page sequence="15">myth of Orpheus, Eurydice seems to have freed herself from the under- world by simply crossing its limits, in Euripides' tragedy Alcestis only ceases to belong to the Beyond at the moment when Herakles, that is, a person belonging in a certain sense to the realm of the dead, takes the veil away from her. The liberation from Hades in both cases seems to depend not on the initiative of a mortal being (even if only in the vest- ments of "liberator" like Orpheus), but on an act of the very same infernal powers which alone have the faculty both to take a person out of the realm of the living and to restore him to it. In conclusion, this means that both mythical episodes can be interpreted as being didactic confirmations of the fact that it is impossible for a mortal being to enter into contact with a being of the Beyond by using only his own force; such a contact can only be realized by the wish of the infernal powers who thus assume explicitly divine prerogatives. These considerations may help to clarify the structure of Alcestis' episode from a genetic viewpoint. To understand, however, the origi- nal significance of the role which Herakles plays in it, we have to re- member that on Thasos the cult of the hero-god included a hierog- amy,50 celebrated by a priest and his wife (symbolizing a non-identi- fied godhead). If such a sexual union is connected with the chthonian- agarian character of Herakles (documented on Thasos and else- where) in forms similar to the Eleusinian ones,51 it may not seem hazardous to suppose that in the episode of Alcestis the traces of an original function of Herakles emerge either connected with the hierog- amy or with the prerogative of the vegetation, which function is eminently infernal. This function could consitute the traditional pre- supposition-no longer understood in Euripides' time-of an episode such as that of Alcestis. The former "infernal spouse,"52 instead of drawing the wife into the other world (as did Hades), rescues her from the realm of the dead, restoring her to her earthly husband. If we suppose a didactic intention in the episode of Alcestis, a similar pas- sage is perfectly possible. On the basis of these investigations we may conclude, first of all, that the infernal character-the character of an infernal deity-of Herakles is also demonstrated by the classical tradition in forms that do not contrast with those documented on Thasos. From the inter- pretation of the episode of Alcestis, which we have just given, the 50 M. Launey, RA (1941), II, 22 ff. 1 One could also be tempted to recognize Demeter in the sacred spouse of Herakles (Launey, Le Sanctuaire et le culte ..., p. 158). Such an interpretation remains, however, strictly hypothetical. 52 We might also think of the hierogamic function of Dionysus in the Athenian cult. 275</page><page sequence="16">The Thracian Herakles function of Herakles is clarified as that of an infernal divinity (not as that of a hero), that is, of the form in which he was venerated in the earliest times on Thasos. The relatedness to Orpheus causes us, furthermore, to confirm the Thracian character of the religiosity to which this original image of Herakles belongs. To this image the Gorgon-in the guise of Alcestis- is also directly related. By examining the adventures of Orpheus and Alcestis from a genetic and structural viewpoint, we have, in fact, learned that man, the mortal one, cannot by himself free anyone from the realm of the dead; and even when the infernal powers agree to his bringing back to the living the person loved, he is subject to precise rules and limita- tions such as not to look into the face of the person who is to be freed from Hades until this one has been liberated from the infernal subjec- tion. Such rules seem really to confirm the inability of the living to enter into contact with the dead and also their inevitable subjection to the infernal powers. It is, therefore, interesting to note that, in an episode in which Herakles appears, these rules consist in forbidding a person to look into the face of the dead as if this one-until she has been freed from her condition of belonging to the other world-had the characteristics of the Gorgon. This means, in fact, that the Gorgon has assumed the symbolic value of "Face of the Other World" and of all the terrifying powers connected with the realm of the dead, including those which became terrifying at the moment at which their beneficent or, at least, positive function was no longer understood. This meaning of the Gorgon, already attested by Homer,53 corresponds exactly to what we have already pointed to regarding her relation to the original image of the Herakles of Thasos. One last point remains to be clarified. While the Gorgon assumed the value of terrifying symbol of the Underworld, how did Herakles in the classical tradition lose more and more-at least in appearance- his aspect of infernal deity, becoming the hero, only to be destined for assumption into Olympus? One might consider, therefore, that two elements came to be super- imposed on the primitive image of Herakles as an infernal divinity as understood in the Thracian religious milieu. The first elements added to this image were Eastern elements that could explain his prerogative of 6OTrvtos 07pwv, and, successively, elements of a heroic concept (on Thasos, the Herakles Kallinikos of Paros) were added. When the 63 Odysseus fears seeing the appearance of the face of Gorgon from the depths of Hades. 276</page><page sequence="17">institutions connected with the infernal image deteriorated and went out of use by being replaced by others in connection with various re- ligious concessions, the heroic figure of Herakles could survive, still maintaining traces of his originally infernal and divine character. Al- ready in the age of Homer, Herakles was the hero and the Gorgon the symbol of that bygone religious world of which the infernal images had survived, assuming strictly negative, terrifying aspects. The fact that Herakles was not also involved in this negative development of the old infernal deities is due-besides to his divine figure-to a heroic in- terpretation of his figure. But when Euripides, who made clear his skepticism toward the religious institutions of his own time, seems to prefer-if only in forms deriving from a literary reversion-the ele- ments of a very old tradition (the one in which Herakles was an in- fernal deity), we think we may rightly suppose that he intends to call back to life by poetic power (a power which is also esoteric and, there- fore, destined to veil rather than to affirm outside of symbolic appear- ances) the elements of a remote religious substratum that had come down to his own time by the means of often secret but still-living cur- rents. It was precisely those elements before which the official re- ligiosity of Euripides' time appeared so desecrated and so illicitly pro- fane as to evoke skepticism and irony in the poet. As poet, he must consider it a task of religious and artistic morality to be the faithful advocate of the orthodoxy of a sacred tradition so remote as to reach back to the time of the very birth of poetry, to the time in which, in the words of Rilke, in der Klage um Linos wagende erste Musik diirre Erstarrung durchdrang, dass erst im erschrockenen Raum, dem ein beinah gottlicher Jiingling plotzlich fiir immer enttrat, das Leere in jene Schwingung geriet, die uns jetz hinreisst und trostet und hilft.
