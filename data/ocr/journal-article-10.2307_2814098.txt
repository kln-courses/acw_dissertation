Since the original publication of Under the Sea Wind in 1941, Rachel Carson has become something of a literary phenomenon, turning the subject of the sea to respectable reading matter for the clientele of the New Yorker and Readers' Digest sets and inspiring a fashion in literature about the sea, its ways, and crea- tures. In her most recent book she has returned to the subject of her first, writing with a more matured and</page><page sequence="2">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 41 improved style. Whereas Under the Sea Wind was about the lives of birds and fishes of coastal waters, somewhat anthropomorphic (see Q.R.B., 17:178. 1942), The Edge of the Sea is about the 3 types of shore along the Atlantic Coast, the rocky shore of New England, the sandy reaches of the mid-coast, and the coral coast of Florida, and the plants and animals (invertebrates especially) characteristic of these three environmental types. The environments are well de- scribed, that of the beach and its sands being especially well done. The book is rich in detail, often with bits of original observation, and without a trace of the per- sonalization which upset some reviewers of her first book. There are, of course, the usual philosophical observations about the endless mystery of the sea, etc., that seem to occur in every such book, but they are very well put and have a lulling, comforting effect upon the reader. Yet we wonder if this book, for all the considerable literary skill that has gone into it, will be as successful as The Sea Around Us. Because of the inevitable amount of detail, it is not a book that can be read easily at a single sitting, and readers who cannot interrupt their reading by going down to the sea to look for themselves may lay it aside after a while. Those who are already interested in seashore life will, of course, read it to see what Miss Carson has to say, and how she says it. Both books have brief appendices which provide details about various plants and animals, although some of the mistakes in that for Under the Sea Wind are still uncorrected. The Edge of the Sea is provided with an index which lists both common and scientific names. The utility of the latter is questionable, for there is often no clue in the text to the name in the index, and therefore only the professional zoologist who knows the names already can use it. Errors in the book are few, but we discover that a large part of the sub- ject matter indexed under Acmaea testudinalis concerns California coast limpets of several species. Further, the author does not seem to realize that more than one species is concerned, which results in a somewhat confused discussion of homing in limpets. The attrac- tive illustrations for the first edition of Under the Sea Wind have been omitted; those for The Edge of the Sea are excellently done, but are without scale and serve primarily as decoration. Many of them have no legend and are identified only by a name in the index which must be known by the specialist. This sort of thing is probably the publisher's fault, although it makes an attractive, reasonably uncluttered page. The people for whom the book is really intended, however, will probably not be disturbed by this arrangement. Since some of them will undoubtedly want to go deeper into the subject, a brief bibliography should have been provided. JOEL W. HEDGPETH</page></plain_text>
