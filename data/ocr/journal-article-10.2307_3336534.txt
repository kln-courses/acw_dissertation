<plain_text><page sequence="1">MASK OCH SKULPTUR UR DE AFRIKANSKA SAMLINGARNA Etnografiska Museet, Stockholm June 25, 1987-July 31, 1988 The legacy of Swedish colonialism remains largely unknown. The ethnographical mu- seums of Stockholm and Gothenburg possess many objects collected by missionaries in the nineteenth century, but only a few have been exhibited since the 1950s and even fewer have been published (see Primitiv Konst, Sigvald Linne and G6sta Montell, eds., Stockholm, 1947). With the exception of the National Mu- seum's major exhibition "Negerkonst" in 1953, the "Bateke (Babembe, Bakongo, Bakuta)" show at Galleri Firg och Form, and "Dolda Skatter" at Liljevalchs Konsthall in 1963-64, there has been no comprehensive showing of the African collections. This exhibition, therefore, of about one hundred masks and statues from the Stockholm re- serves was an important event. Some objects were shown for the first time, a few collected as early as 1884. The exhibit included rare examples of the Ngolo, Ladi, and Hombo peoples, and a number of uncontestable pieces of merit: three fine Kota mbulu ngulu, a remarkable northern Fang bieri, impressive Kongo nkisi nkonde and magnificent Yombe phemba, several exquisite Bembe figurines, two delicate Teke and Yaka carvings, a serene Songye/Mongo power figure, elegant Mano "portrait statues," powerful animal head- pieces (a Senufo bird and "firespitter," Bamana and Kurumba antelopes), and superb masks from the Vai, Dan, Toma, Mende, Bobo, Ejagham, Duala, and Chokwe. The exhibition was an overview of the AAWI,? 86</page><page sequence="2">Awi f -ot, sculpture of the most artistically productive ethnic groups of West and Central Africa, as exemplified in the Stockholm collections. Most major types were represented with a few exceptions: there were no Dogon, Lobi, or Baule statues; no Guru, Teke, Kwele, Punu, Pende, Lega, or Makonde masks. Few items from the Benue River peoples were displayed, and northern Zaire was represented only by a delightful Mbole/Lengola figure. Also notable for their absence were Luba ancestor and Chokwe chief figures, and the famous Benin bronzes of which the museum possesses some rare examples. Because these were dis- played during the "Treasures of Ancient Ni- geria" exhibition in 1983, curator Bjbrn Ranung decided to leave them out, especially since wood had been chosen as the medium for the show. Except for two ivory Lega figurines and the brass-copper Kota re- liquaries, objects in other materials were not represented. While featuring the highlights of the Stockholm collection for visitors unfamil- iar with the topic, Ranung also uncovered some lesser-known types to merit the interest of specialists. A centrally located map oriented the visitor. Informative labels were grouped together on separate platforms, so they did not interfere with the viewing of the objects. The design of the installation was highly original: four semicircular display cases of grand scale em- braced the viewer as he entered a nocturnal environment populated by dimly lit carvings. Everything was painted black (floor, backdrops, platforms, and cylindrical stands), creating a magico-religious atmo- sphere. The two central cases contained masks and costumed mannequins (a Yoruba Egungun, an example from the Ibibio Ekpo society and a Kuyu kebe-kebe). These were flanked by two panels of field photos of sev- eral masquerades represented in the exhibi- tion. The two corner display cases exhibited statues of all sizes ranging from small Lega figurines from the Bwami association to Bwende anthropomorphic, funerary trum- pets that are quite rare. In this theatrical instal- lation the viewer was made to feel like a parti- cipant in a masquerade dance. Only music was missing to set some of these masks into mo- tion. In the stillness of ethnographical mu- seums, too often we forget that these masks are meant to be experienced against a background of drums and repetitive vocals. This was an attractive show, and in many respects a revelation. There were delightful elements to be discovered (such as the amus- ing detail of an enormous nail piercing the head of a Sundi nkonde crosswise). Objects were notable for their novelty of design (a Ngolo mask and statue), intensity of expres- sion (Bembe and Kongo power sculptures), forceful realism (Ejagham headdresses), ele- gance and sophistication (Vai, Dan, and Chokwe masks; Teke, Yaka, Mano, and Songye/Mongo figures), and mastery of execution (Fang bieri and Yombe maternities). Different styles and traditions were brought together: expressionistic We and Wobe masks with their protruding forms were juxtaposed with a stylized Bamana chiwara headdress or a linear Bwa mask. Highly accumulative Kongo nail sculptures were placed against a background of iconic, flat Kota reliquary guardian figures. Together with the Fang bieri the latter represent a sublime expression of African art in their spirituality and formalism. Overall the selection of the pieces was satis- factory, both artistically and ethnographically. It included objects of universal significance- those related to the cult of ancestors, to a moral or ethical code, or to ideal beauty as a symbol of excellence, balance, and order. Other items fulfilled more personal needs, some meant to combat witchcraft and provide protection. The masking traditions were con- cerned with initiation, hunting, and agricul- tural rites; fertility; the well-being of commu- nity and individual; and entertainment. NGOLO MASK, CAMEROON. ACQUIRED 1893. M. NENNES COLLECTION. It is my deepest wish that similar exhibi- tions will become the norm in Stockholm. Far more attention has been given to contempo- rary African art and artifacts (the Kul- turhuset's exhibitions) than to the artistic heritage of this vast and fascinating continent. For the last four years an installation of a Sundi-Mongo village featuring several Bembe and Kongo power sculptures and Bwende cloth-covered mannequins (muzidi) has pro- vided a taste of the strength of the museum's collections from the Lower Congo. A red- clothed, gigantic niombo dominates the model village from afar. Used as a burial container in funerary rites to honor the death of important individuals, it symbolizes with its gestures the transition to the afterlife. This lively instal- lation (conceived by Bjdrn Ranung) enables the viewer to study the iconography and stylistic variations within a single genre of ob- jects from the same region. Perhaps the addi- tion of this comprehensive overview from the permanent collections heralds the dawn of a new era for Stockholm. One looks forward to future similar instructive and visually appeal- ing shows, perhaps from Gothenburg as well. The Etnografiska Museet's most important collection remains Karl Laman's legacy of about 2,500 objects from Gabon and the Lower Congo; many of them, donated be- tween 1919 and 1954, were included in his two volumes on The Kongo (Studia Etnografica Upsalliensia, 1953-68). A detailed documenta- tion of the Stockholm collections is under way, but rumor has it that the project may take as long as a decade and will cover the art of other continents as well.
