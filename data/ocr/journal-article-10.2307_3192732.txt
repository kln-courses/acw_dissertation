<plain_text><page sequence="1">isually Unacceptable lmost everyone agrees that society benefits if artwork is made and seen and understood. Beyond that basic agreement, however, rise questions about what forms and what contents are legitimate, and who decides. Paul Klee pointed to skillful depiction as the falsest criterion for art, telling a story about a painter exerting every effort to group formal elements logically and purely while a layperson complained that the developing picture did not look a bit like the model.' Many observers still associate good art with reality depicted representationally, the same way fairy tales equate hand- some with heroic and ugly with evil. Even though the modern artist has em- ployed advanced technology and theories for more than a hundred years to invent forms and motifs suitable for changed needs and attitudes, the out- moded myth persists. An example of the gap between art- ists' altered intentions and viewers' un- modified expectations is the furor that erupted around the Joan Mir6 sculpture installed opposite Chicago's Daley Plaza. The piece was unveiled by civic leaders and art patrons on April 20, 1981, the sculptor's 88th birthday. John Russell, New York Times art critic, en- dorsed the work and described it as a tall, standing figure, part beauty queen, part female Neptune, stepping ashore at dawn from the chill waters of Lake Michigan. A local art school professor, John Fabion, contradicted Russell in a series of letters to the newspapers. He condemned the Mir6 piece as crude, in- sane, and visually unacceptable. Busy lobbying for the life-like antiquities he admires, Fabion missed a chance as an educator to help his readers see that the concrete Mir6 fabricated in Chicago shares attributes with his beloved Apollo Belvedere carved from marble around 140 AD. Despite different materials, construction processes, and purposes, both sculptors evoked their culture's current themes. Joan Mir6 started out as a young Peg Griffith emigre painter in Paris after World War I, a period of violent social, political, and intellectual upheaval. Avant-garde artists, writers, composers, and choreo- graphers were assailing traditional con- ventions. There was a stronger spirit of fellowship and much less attention to public consumption than we see among young artists living in New York today. The Surrealist group Mir6 joined was led by Andre Breton, art theoretician and author, who had been impressed with psycholanalytic methods during his brief studies under Sigmund Freud. Automatism in particular appealed to Breton. It was a procedure Freud de- signed to help clients deal with the primitive, irrational self. Breton per- suaded the Surrealists to substitute automatism for the drugs and hypnosis they had relied on previously to conjure up new visions for their works. Group members could circumvent questions of skill and taste by making the sub- conscious responsible for their fantasti- cal, incongruous forms arranged in il- logical juxtapositions. However, their denial of logic did not rule out equi- librium. After allowing the brush or pen to wander on the canvas or paper, the surrealist consciously assumed control, adding marks deliberately wherever they were needed to perfect the composi- tion's balance. The cheerful anthropomorphic per- sonages and calligraphic lines that characterize Mir6's body of work echo the Catalan folk art and tales he knew in childhood, his dreams and fantasies, and the architecture he saw during his student days in Barcelona, especially Antoni Gaudi's organic proliferation of forms, sinuous ironwork, curved plaster walls, and oval polychrome-tile mosaics. To convince Chicagoans that sculpture like Mir6's is to be taken seriously as art, despite its playful mien, requires more than occasional visits to the Chicago Art Institute. A more consequential step would be to integrate art history with the history curriculum. Then pupils in an American history class in secondary school-the last time most people study history of any kind-would be taught not only what President Theodore Roosevelt did between 1901 and 1909 about the miners' strike, restraint of trade, and federal regulation of the railroads, but would learn also about Nude Descending A Staircase, Marcel Duchamp's show-stopper painting at the 1913 Armory exhibition in New York, a landmark event in the evolution of modern art. That show, organized by the Association of American Painters and Sculptors, presented 1,500 recent artworks, one third of them from Euro- pean capitals. Fifty-seven thousand astonished, outraged, or delighted Americans-Teddy Roosevelt among them-saw for the first time the scale and scope of what was happening in twentieth century art. After Roosevelt finished examining the wild explosion of monochromatic shapes on Duchamp's canvas, he dismissed the French painter as crazy.2 This widely-quoted verdict was made by a well-educated (Harvard 1880) ex-president, who had not done sufficient homework to assess properly whether or not the painting succeeded in bringing something forward out of silence and invisibility, which is what John Updike says art is supposed to do. It would be a simpler matter to judge art if all artists shared the same vocabu- lary or even similar concepts. Stuart Davis, the American muralist, embraced the European ideas in the Armory Show, but Clyfford Still, American abstract expressionist, called them sterile, decadent European trends dumped on America.3 Duchamp's ra- tionale for Nude was that he could use any symbol he wanted-a dot, a line, a conventional or unconventional sign- in any way he wanted to say what he wanted said. He believed that art is the only form of activity in which people show themselves to be true individuals, Art Education September 1983 I -1 38</page><page sequence="2">*f we have discovered anything during this era, it is how little we know about ourselves and our universe." and he assigned himself responsibility for clearing away anything that blocked easy access to full artistic expression. Taste became his enemy, because he said it was nothing more than habit, the same thing repeated over and over.4 To break this habit Duchamp began exhibiting a series of "readymades," or- dinary manufactured products that Breton theorized were promoted to the dignity of art by the artist's designation. Probably the best-known readymade is the store-bought Mona Lisa reproduc- tion on which Duchamp pencilled a mustache, goatee, and L.H.O.O.Q., in- itials which become an obscene play on words when pronounced "Elle a chaud au cul." Some of Duchamp's colleagues were less willing than he to aggravate the viewer. Man Ray, who exhibited along with Mir6 in the first Surrealist show, worked earnestly toward strengthening his alliance with the gallery visitor. One of the painted panels he showed in 1916 at Daniels, a swank New York gallery, had a push button and two bells attached.5 Though guests at the open- ing suspected Dadaist deadpan clown- ing when they pushed the button and nothing happened, the farthest thing from Man Ray's mind was humor. He simply wanted the observer to par- ticipate actively. Nearly sixty years later, Allan Kaprow, the father of Happenings, achieved what Man Ray's panel failed to do. Kaprow created a series of ac- tivities to be undertaken by volunteers. Warm-Ups, sponsored by the Center for Advanced Visual Studies and executed for the first time in October 1975, in Boston, is an activity for four partici- pants: A, B, C, D. During one section of this activity both B and C stand with an ice cube pressed between their fore- heads. They alternate saying "Is it warm yet?" and "Not yet," until the ice cube melts and both of them reply "Yes." Christo's Running Fence is typical of sculptural hybrids that add the dimen- sions of time and site. The artwork's white nylon yardage billowed for two weeks from a length of metal cable, un- dulating across a 24-mile strip of north- ern California ranchland and disappear- ing down a slope into the Pacific Ocean. According to Christo the fence itself was only one particular of the four-year pro- ject piece that cost him 2 million dollars to produce. In the sculptor's judgment the artwork consists of plans, written proposals, and specifications, plus steel cables and posts, 350,000 hooks, and 165,000 yards of fabric, plus staff members handling administration, fence workers erecting the construction, team- sters hauling supplies and crew, helicopter pilots transporting documen- tary camera teams around the site, ran- chers signing or not signing land-use permits, lawyers battling unsympathetic owners over access to private property-all equally important ele- ments in creating Running Fence. A look at other fields shows how much they too have revised their para- meters: until the University of Liverpool established one in 1908, no chair of social anthropology existed anywhere; before Werner Heisenberg published papers on chance and indeterminacy in the 1930s, it was commonly believed that every specific cause resulted in a predictable effect; cartographers had never fully mapped the sea floor until a few decades ago when marine geologists delineated its contours for the first time. Countless subfields existing today were previously unknown. In mathematics, for example, some sub- fields are so highly specialized that workers in one area do not understand clearly what their colleagues in another area are doing. The same complexity and proliferation is true for art. It is no more frozen for eternity than science. Broadened choices for art students will further fragment the already large vari- ety of forms and subjects that are con- sidered valid for artistic investigation. Undergraduates at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago are exposed to drawing and painting, as were their 19th century predecessors, but they also may sign up for courses such as Process I, an investigation of imaging systems, in- cluding heat, light, magnetics, sound, time, and information processing. The number of practicing artists is highest at a time when public tolerance for advanced artforms is lowest,6 a situation that threatens to turn risk- taking for artistic purposes into con- formity for survival. The public's refusal to make connections between how an artwork looks and the issues it addresses, such as the nature of material, acts as a brake, a burden, a form of censorship that discourages ar- tists from showing us their research, or from doing it at all. If we have dis- covered anything during this era, it is how little we know about ourselves and our universe. An individual who is aware of the past and informed ar- tistically and scientifically about the pre- sent is more likely to empathize with those struggling to engage the ac- cumulated mysteries that surround our lives. Given its freedom, art can help us by making us better able to analyze our existence and to identify its nature more accurately.
