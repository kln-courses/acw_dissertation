<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael Rawson The March of Bricks and Mortar In 1829, the great English illustrator George Cruikshank published a remarkable etching in his second collection of Scraps and Sketches. Entitled "London Going out of Town, or the March of Bricks and Mortar/' the image portrays the expansion of nineteenth-century London as an invasion of the countryside by building tools, construc- tion materials, and even entire tenement blocks that have magically come to life. Cruikshank was conveying the same anxiety over the speed and scale of early British urbanization that others were expres- sing in prose. In fact, the words of one of his contemporaries could have served as a caption for the image. "The rage for building/' lamen- ted the observer, "fills every pleasant outlet with bricks, mortar, rubbish and eternal scaffold-poles, which, whether you walk east, west, north, or south, seem to be running after you." But Cruikshank's creation - which is far better known among urban than environmen- tal historians - manages to transcend its specific historical context. Despite its origins in the early nineteenth century, the image feels strangely contemporary, for it prompts troubling questions about urban expansion and its environmental consequences that we still wrestle with today.1 The etching's power lies in its fantastically rich details. From the left, the direction of London, a robotic army advances into the country- side. Its soldiers have chimney pots for bodies, cowls and mortar-filled hods for heads, and picks and shovels for limbs. Their leader points his © 2012 The Author.

Enquire of Mr. Goth, Brickmaker, Bricklayers Arms, Brick Lane, Brixton." Other invading troops made from a variety of builder's tools have already gone to work sawing off limbs from trees, digging cellar holes, and sifting sand for mortar. Rows of cheaply built tenements - still in scaffolding yet already crum- bling - roll forward on giant wheels, while a kiln supports the advance by firing a barrage of hot bricks into the fields and pastures. In the dis- tance, half-completed homes sit in open fields presumably cleared by earlier assaults. The rural response appears on the right side of the image, where cows, sheep, geese, and birds flee in panic, haystacks run for their lives, and trees bend before the onslaught. It is obvious at a glance that the countryside never stood a chance against this urban juggernaut. Cruikshank lightened the mood by sprinkling the scene of battle with puns. "We are losing ground here/' shouts a retreating haystack, while a desperate tree cries, "I must leave the field!" Another tree, part of a grove watching the route from a distant hill, predicts that nearby fences "will ... be no defense against these Barbarians who threaten to enclose and destroy us in all 'manor' of ways." But this thin veneer of humor does not conceal the fact that Cruikshank's image is primarily a portrait of violence and destruction. The scene strongly evokes "The Sorcerer's Apprentice," a story made popular in 1940 by Walt Disney but traceable to ancient sources. In Cruikshank's version, the apprentice has not just instructed a broom to fill a basin with water but commanded entire blocks of houses to subdue and colonize the countryside. The story is moving toward its climax, after the apprentice has set his magical forces in motion but before he has realized they are out of control and doing more harm than good. Until that moment of awareness comes, the robotic builders will mindlessly follow their instructions and continue to cover the countryside with new development. Cruikshank chose not to portray the apprentice, the one responsible for setting the scene in motion. In fact, although Cruikshank ani- mated just about everything in the image, he did not include a single human figure. There are no greedy builders, or corrupt officials, or aspiring home owners urging the invaders onward. Cruikshank might be suggesting the complicity of church and state by having the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral, on the far left, and the flag-bedecked towers of Westminster Abbey, in the center, overlook the scene. But they seem to be watching the assault rather than driving it. Perhaps the reason we do not see the apprentice in the picture is that he lies outside of it: Cruikshank might be suggesting that we, the viewers, are the ones who have set the urban armies in motion or at least helped to fuel their continued advance. In that case, his "March of Bricks and Mortar" functions as a wake-up call, alerting us</page><page sequence="3">846 I Environmental History 17 (October 2012) Figure 1: George Cruikshank, London Going out of Town, or The March of Bricks and Mortar, 1829.

(continued) shopworn today, since we live in an increasingly urban world that is as saturated with technology as it is with fear of it. But Cruikshank's warning has a special resonance. By speaking to us from the distant</page><page sequence="5">848 I Environmental History 17 (October 2012) past, from the early days of urbanization and industrialization, it emphasizes not just where we are in the larger story but the incredible length of time that we have been stalled there. A modern viewer is left to wonder whether the sorcerer has any plans to return at all. The threat portrayed in the image is not just to nonhuman nature. Cruikshank subtly suggests that humans have become the victims of runaway technology as well. People might be absent from the image, but human voices, feelings, and faces are not. Cruikshank gives them to the trees and haystacks rather than the invaders, who remain mute, unemotional, and largely featureless. Through the se- lective use of anthropomorphism, he seems to suggest that there is something far more human about the natural world than the technol- ogy overrunning it. When the trees and haystacks are driven from the field, so will be the last trace of humanity in Cruikshank's vision. That, in fact, is the implied ending of the story, at least at this point in the narrative: the city, a technological system of immense power and complexity, will replace the countryside almost entirely with bricks and mortar. The urban world encroaching from the left of the image contains no vegetation. Only two animals appear: a heavily shadowed horse pulling a cart full of rubbish behind the trowel-wielding leader and a demonic animal perched atop a marching chimney pot to suggest that urban expansion corrupts what nature it does not destroy. Even the sky itself feels absent, for it is entirely blotted out by the black smoke of endless chimneys. Modern historians of the urban environment would disagree with Cruikshank's suggestion that nature is largely missing from cities: it is easy to overlook how nature manifests itself in the air that urbanités breathe, the water they drink, the plots they garden, the pets they own, the waste they produce, the rivers they sail. Nature is everywhere transformed, but it remains everywhere nonetheless. It is harder to find fault with Cruikshank's decision to animate building technologies, since it nicely captures the fact that London's unprecedented growth could seem almost supernatural to shocked contemporaries. "Squares, streets, and crescents," wrote one midcen- tury commentator, "have sprung up as if by magic." It might be tempt- ing to think that twenty-first-century observers like us have grown used to such rapid environmental change. But we have not, in part because continued innovation in building materials and techniques has repeatedly multiplied the speed of construction. A recent bystand- er outside of Boulder, Colorado, marveled at a new housing project that "seemed like it sprang up overnight!" Although separated by over a century and a half, the sentiments voiced by these two observers are strikingly similar, reminding us that sudden changes to familiar natural areas - like those Cruikshank portrays - have always been dif- ficult to absorb.2 That might go part way toward explaining why Cruikshank chose this subject: he knew the area pictured in the etching. The orientation</page><page sequence="6">Gallery I 849 of St. Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey, together with the "Hampstead" sign on the upper right just above the haystacks, indi- cates that the site under attack is a region north of the city that was developing rapidly at the time. In 1829, Cruikshank would have had at least two reasons for caring about this area. First, the Lord of the Manor of Hampstead had just petitioned Parliament for permission to grant building leases on Hampstead Heath, a controversial act that precipitated a forty-year conservation battle. Second, Cruikshank had moved into a recently built house in this area only a few years before. That fact threatens to insert an ironic tone into the etching's story, for it makes Cruikshank look like a familiar stereotype: the new resident of a recently constructed development who was attracted by the local natural amenities and now wants to preserve them by cutting off future immigration. In other words, Cruikshank's defense of the countryside starts to look a bit self-serving.3 Whatever his true motivations, Cruikshank's critique of urban ex- pansion at rural expense has remained disappointingly relevant to later generations. In a biography of Cruikshank published in 1908, Wilfred Hugh Chesson ranked the image as the best of those included in Scraps and Sketches. "No one/' wrote Chesson, "who has seen a suburb grow inexorably in the field and orchard, obliterating gracious forms and sealing up the live earth, can miss the pathos of this master- piece." The twentieth-century English historian Arnold Toynbee recalled that a copy of the etching had hung in the staircase of the London house where he spent his childhood. Inspired by "its vigour and its ferocity," Toynbee made Cruikshank's metaphor of marching bricks and mortar the central theme of his 1970 history of urbaniza- tion, Cities on the Move. Even today, Cruikshank's portrait of the vor- acious appetite for what we now call "greenfield development" remains an all too familiar one. We seem unable to regain control over the forces we have loosed.4 Our failure is not for want of trying. The years since Cruikshank completed his etching have been filled with ideas for redirecting his advancing chimney pots or even stopping them in their tracks. As early as the mid-nineteenth century, landscape designers like Frederick Law Olmsted tried to bring the country back into the city in the form of pastoral parks and to combine the best of city and country in low-density suburbs. At the turn of the twentieth century, Ebenezer Howard popularized the idea of surrounding towns with permanent greenbelts. Half a century later, William Whyte advocated the preservation of rural land through conservation easements and cluster development. Now we have a New Urbanism movement that promotes denser communities integrated with public transportation as a way to reduce the environmental impact of urban sprawl. Yet the bricks and mortar march on, with the United States having lost an average of 1.4 million acres of countryside</page><page sequence="7">850 I Environmental History 17 (October 2012) per year over the past quarter century, and China's cities overrunning its rural villages at a stunning pace. The problem remains, so the power of Cruikshank's image endures.5 Today, 'The March of Bricks and Mortar" reminds us that the environ- mental challenges and cultural anxieties that accompany modern urban expansion are anything but new. We have been talking about sustain- able urban development for a very long time indeed. Yet we continue to make the same trade-off as prior generations, leaving us no less troubled and considerably worse off given the cumulative environmen- tal damage. Cruikshank's wake-up call has gone largely unanswered, for after almost two hundred years we still seem unable to move the story forward from the point that his etching so powerfully portrays. That's why the image remains important: it continues to tell us in a graphic and memorable way that we must keep trying because no one else is going to tame the forces of urbanization for us. It is for this reminder, I like to think, that Arnold Toynbee's parents kept a copy on their wall. It is certainly why I keep a copy on mine.

The same quote appears in Charles Molloy Westmacott, The English Spy, vol. 2 (London: Thomas Davison, 1826), 71, which was illustrated by Cruik- shank's brother Robert and was likely familiar to Cruikshank. It is possible that the quote served as an inspiration for the etching. The most complete historical assessment of Cruikshank's life and work is Robert L.

Robert Patten describes the new neighborhood as follows: "The whole area had just been developed for middle-class families on fields adjacent to the New River Head reservoir east of the northern extremity of Gray's Inn Road. The short rows of four-story terrace houses overlooked open spaces, neither city nor country" (Patten, George Cruikshank's Life, vol. 1, 217). 4 Wilfred Hugh Chesson, George Cruikshank (London: Duckworth and Co., 1908), 36; Arnold Toynbee, Cities on the Move (Cambridge: Oxford University Press,</page><page sequence="8">Gallery I 851 1970), 4. The copy hanging in Toynbee 's childhood home was inscribed by Cruik- shank himself, who had been a friend of Toynbee's grandfather. Toynbee described his grandfather as "the first ear, nose, and throat specialist in London" and "one of the pioneers in the belated struggle to provide elementary sanitation and other first-aid for public health in the new urban wilderness that the march of bricks and mortar had conjured into existence" (Toynbee, 4). 5 The figure for the United States is derived from US Department of Agriculture, Natural Resource Conservation Service, Summary Report: 2007 National Resources Inventory (Washington, DC), 7.</page></plain_text>
