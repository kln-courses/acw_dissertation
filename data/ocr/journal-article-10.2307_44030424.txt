<plain_text><page sequence="1">Writing of his encounters with a Sonoran sorcerer, Carlos Castañeda describes his experience of flight under the influence of datura. To the question "Did I really fly, don Juan?" his benefactor explains that, while in flight, Carlos's corporeal body was "in the bushes," raising questions on the relationships of consciousness to corpse, body to perceptual environments, and human mind to nature's pharmacopoeia. Lines of Flight of the Deadly Nightshade: An Enquiry into the Properties of the Magical Plant, its Literature and History DAVID MJ. CARRUTHERS Thanks to the plant, fixed in place by its roots, dead plants , animals, and humans are unmoored from their "resting places' they travel or migrate, just as in cer- tain non-Western religions souls can find their rein- carnation in plants. Unlike the crypt, supposed to keep (though it never lives up to its mission) its inhabitant place, surrounded by inorganic matter, the grave cov- ered by a flowerbed is always already opened, exceed- ing the domain of the earth and blurring the boundaries between life and death. - Michael Marder, Plant-Thinking Michael view film for of Pollan, the his documentary non-fiction in an inter- view for the documentary film of his non-fiction book, The Botany of Desire, treating "plants so compelling and useful and tasty they would inspire human beings to seed, transport, extol, and even write books about them" (xxi), in a rather duplicitous statement, asserts, "Of course, plants don't have consciousness or intention" (Schwarz). Forgiving the fact that Pollan, himself, throughout his treatment of the domesticated apple, tulip, cannabis, and potato, relies regularly on the language of intention to describe the abilities , the powers of these Mosaic 48/2 0027-1276-07/1 19014$02.00©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">120 Mosaic 48/2 (June 2015) plants to bestir desire, to motivate humans to ensure the plants' succession - for instance, that "Cannabis recognized , metaphorically speaking, that [intoxication] was its path to world domination" (Schwarz, emph. mine) - there is something disingen- uous, or worse, simple, in the wholesale dismissal of plant intentionality in light of their abilities to so move humankind. While the desire bespoken in the title of Pollans text is first and foremost an ani- mal desire, accidentally tapped by some hundreds of millions, in the case of non- human animals, and some hundreds of thousands, in the case of human animals, of years of plants' experimentation through mutation, the plant desire - to live, to repro- duce, to succeed - though unintentional to Pollan, figures prominently as the back- drop to and origin of this evolutionary economy. This capacity for plants to move, whether it be intransitive - "by altering its state, by growing, and by decaying" (Aristotle qtd. in Marder 20), the most primitive mobility denoting soul in Aristotle; and more sophisticated movement, including the Salvia divinorums walking across the forest floor and the Mimosa hostilis's reaction to "tickling" - or transitive - the plant's capacity to organize matter, to attract or repel friends or foes - decides the question of plant desire and at some gradation, then, plant intent, not so easily dis- missed, as does Pollan, for fear of committing some unbecoming anthropomorphism. This essay, too, treats the topic of the means by which plants move their human subjects, though not in the way that Pollan intends. So, also, does it attend to the ter- ritory of intoxication, though only as one possible explanation of the phenomenon at the plant-human intersection. By tracing a line of flight through the historical liter- ary tradition recollecting the strange properties of the nightshade, I intend to situate the magical plant within the purview of plant studies in order to approach a concep- tion of plant qua plant, outside of anthropomorphic and instrumentalizing concep- tions of vegetal life. I evaluate two contradictory epistemologies summoned by the nightshade and its application in the witches' flying ointment, in order to underscore the means by which the plant resists the metaphysical "logic of totalization" (Marder). My through own odd the and anthropological early encounters writings with of the Carlos datura Castañeda, nightshade, have introduced stuck with to me, me through the anthropological writings of Carlos Castañeda, have stuck with me, shaping the direction of my present research and my comprehension of these ancient dark arts and their contributions to a working understanding of plants, per- ceptual science, and its limitations. For those perhaps unfamiliar with Castaneda's legacy, his popular work, The Teachings of Don Juan : A Yaqui Way of Knowledge, traces the UCLA anthropology student's encounters with a Sonoran sorcerer named don Juan Matus between the years 1961 and 1964. During these encounters, Carlos</page><page sequence="3">David M J. Carruthers 121 finds himself (perhaps unwillingly) initiated into an apprenticeship in indigenous magic, by means of the experience of what he determines to be "non-ordinary real- ity" (21) facilitated by the use of three psychotropic plants: lophophora williamsii, or peyote, referred to as mescalito ; a mushroom mixture of the genus psilocybe called the humito or "little smoke"; and la yerba del Diablo , or the Devil's weed, of the genus datura , known also as jimsonweed, Jamestown Weed, thorn-apple, devil's apple, angel's trumpet, devil's trumpet, and by as many names as the devil himself. Throughout the course of Castaneda's texts, twelve in total published over thirty- one years, Carlos gains insight into a magical way of engaging with his world. The means of acquiring such personal power, as don Juan explains in the course of the first three texts, is through what is essentially a defamiliarization of one's perceptual capac- ity through the ecstatic states evoked by the psychotropic experience. By loosening the way in which ideological presuppositions have shaped and fixed the sorcerer's inter- pretation of the world, benefactor don Juan explains, the apprentice can begin to learn new modes of perception and therefore new and magical means of interaction with his or her environ.1 Some of the non-ordinary feats conducted by apprentice-Carlos include shapeshifting with the aid of peyote while at play with a pet canine ( Teachings 45-50); battling a giant guardian gnat with the help of the little smoke ( Reality 1 16-18); clairvoyance, as he sees through the eyes of a remote lizard ( Teachings 153-54); and flight under the influence of the datura (126-27). In one instant, he is teleported across Mexico City, pushed through a door to emerge miles away, and this the first of such non-ordinary experiences without the aid of mind-altering plants (Tales 147-48). It is no great wonder, then, that Castaneda's anthropological works were met with, and continue to meet, strong critical reception. At the time of publication, how- ever, being at the fore of the then-novel movement of emic anthropology, wherein field researchers aimed to overcome the critical distance between themselves and their material of study by "going native," as it were, Castañeda was heralded as a hero of the academic community that produced him, even making his way onto the cover of Time Magazine (5 March 1973). His work was, at that time, acclaimed as having finally resolved the ideological biases that kept an anthropologist from truly comprehending the people he wished to come to know. UCLA awarded Castañeda both his baccalau- reate and doctorate, in 1962 and 1973, respectively, for his publication of The Teachings of don Juan and Journey to Ixtlan , thereby popularizing indigenous shaman- ism and psychedelia in America and the West, in the manner that R. Gordon Wasson had, some years prior, introduced cubensis and amanita , as did Aldous Huxley mesca- line, and as was, at that same time, Timothy Leary with LSD, and as would Terence McKenna dimethyltriptamine some years later.</page><page sequence="4">1 22 Mosaic 48/2 (June 2015) By 1976, however, public and academic enthusiasm for Castañedas writings drew the criticism of scientologist and psychologist Richard de Mille, who, little renowned for his investigative journalism, took it upon himself to disprove, by any measure, Castañedas narrative reports. For many - at a time when most of those who had "[t]urn[ed] on, tune[d] in, [and] drop[ped] out" (Leary) were already re-enlisting, re-enrolling, and re-applying - de Milled Castañedas Journey : The Power and the Allegory and The Don Juan Papers: Further Castañeda Controversies were received as an end to said controversies, landing the critical nail into the academic coffin of Castañedas work. Amid charges of plagiarism (de Mille), of unethical and impoverished anthro- pology (Spicer), of cultural misappropriation (Fikes), of leading a life that was less than "impeccable" (Geuter),2 public pressure to produce the elusive don Juan,3 and an oeuvre growing less and less intellectually rigorous as his cult following grew more acquiescent, Castañeda withdrew from the public eye, refusing to openly defend his work against these charges as the revenue from some 28 million copies sold contin- ued to furnish a lavish Malibu lifestyle. And yet, while many of these charges, espe- cially those defending the American Indian from the cultural fallout resultant of Castañedas popularity, are sound, de Milles attack, leading the charge against Castaneda's work, is especially not so. What the researcher finds upon examining de Milles critique is, for a great por- tion of his work, an ad hominem attack, at times going as far as to psychoanalyze the absentee author to determine that Castañeda, because of an abrupt departure from his father and the accidental fracture of a cousin's collarbone, is some sort of attention- seeking deceptive who, for reasons not other than malice, got off on tricking and harming people (Castañedas Journey 134-36, 42). Another accusation made by de Mille, to belabour a moot point, is on the improbability that the apprentice-character could have sewn some lizards' eyelids and mouth with an agave thread because it was dusk and the needle was imprecise,4 thereby calling the integrity of the entire text into question. Besides being mostly speculative, de Mille's arguments are especially cir- cumstantial: something apropos to arguing that, because Castañeda reports doing something on one day when it was instead another (though none of his "proofs" are this specific), the veracity of Castaneda's entire report must be suspect. In fact, the most solid evidence that de Mille proposes in his Allegory against Castañeda are both his ridicule of the historicity of events reported by the author - that Carlos had been reading in the library on topics akin to those of his study at the time he reports field-working: god forbid! - and the attention paid to the narrativity of events - that the texts were arbitrated in one way or another (as are all), and there-</page><page sequence="5">David MJ. Carruthers 123 fore false. Til not go into any further detail of de Mille's accusations against Castañeda, for he's not an especially interesting nor an especially good critic, but suf- fice it to say that because of an academic audience already eager to bury Castañedas work - for its provocative claims that threaten the very foundations of the rationalist and materialist discourses on which the modern disciplines are founded - de Mille ushered in the beginning of the end for any serious intellectual treatment of the magic of Castaneda's psychotropisms.5 That is, at least, until, writing in 1980, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, still feel- ing the effects of Castañedas legacy and circumventing the problem of authenticity, decide that: "In the course of Castaneda's books, the reader may begin to doubt the existence of the Indian Don Juan, and many other things besides. But that has no importance. So much the better if the books are a syncretism rather than an ethno- graphical study, and the protocol of an experiment rather than an account of an ini- tiation" (161-62). As a syncretism, Castaneda's is a noble attempt to explain the unassimilable, asemiotic experience of the psychotrope into the signifying regime, using any and all ideological instruments available at his disposal; as the "protocol of an experiment," the daturay or its similar nightshade familiars, is one tried and tested throughout the ages. Castaneda's flight at the plant-human intersection is but a part, albeit one of the most recent and most popular, of a long literary tradition, both Old World and New, reporting similar observations to the experimentům of flying with the aid of the lamiarum unguenta , the witches' flying ointment. Perhaps one of the most controversial and yet, contradictorily, one of the most accessible of the magical feats claimed by Castañeda, in The Teachings of Don Juan , describes the anthropologist-become-apprentice's experience of flight under the powerful spell of the datura nightshade. He enlightens, [Don Juan] guided me in applying the [datura] paste on the inside part of my whole left leg, on my genitals, down the inside of my whole right leg, and finally on the sole of my right foot. I followed his directions. The paste was cold and had a particularly strong odor. When I had finished applying it I straightened up. The smell from the mixture entered my nostrils. It was suffocating me. The pungent odor was actually choking me. It was like a gas of some sort. I tried to breathe through my mouth and I tried to talk to don Juan, but I couldn't. Don Juan kept staring at me. I took a step towards him. My legs were rubbery and long, extremely long. I took another step. My knee joints felt springy, like a vault pole; they shook and vibrated and contracted elastically. I moved forward. The motion of my body was slow and shaky; it was more like a tremor forward and up. I looked down and saw don Juan sit- ting below me, way below me. The momentum carried me forward one more step, which was even more elastic and longer than the preceding one. And from there I soared. [. . .] I</page><page sequence="6">124 Mosaic 48/2 (June 2015) saw the dark sky above me, and the clouds going by me. I jerked my body so I could look down. I saw the dark mass of the mountains. My speed was extraordinary. (126) Upon descending, Carlos explains, The next thing I remembered is the feeling of waking up. I was in my bed in my own room. I sat up. And the image of my room dissolved. I stood up. I was naked! The motion of standing made me sick again. I recognized some of the landmarks. I was about half a mile from don Juan's house, near the place of his Datura plants. (127) One can see here the blurring of traditional anthropological writing into perhaps ethno- or even entheo-botanical writing, and the reason for such a din surrounding these works. One's own skepticism at encountering such seemingly radical exposi- tions of a man in flight, however, is succeeded only by the overly anxious anthropol- ogist's, by the subject's own. Carlos, in an attempt to assimilate this non-ordinary experience into his presumably otherwise-"rational" worldview, to narrate the experience of flight in accordance with his presuppositions about the world, demands, "Did I really fly, don Juan?" (129). The radi- cal break here - akin to a psychic trauma - between the apprentice's expectations of a rather static, even mundane "world" and another, seemingly discontinuous with the familiar, prompts him in disbelief to question the ontological status of his experience. Bound up in this question - did I really fly? - are two contentious positions on the nature of reality: the one, a social constructivist or consensus reality, wherein the real is authorized and verified by expressed agreement between social subjects; the other, a radical and metaphysical subjectivism, perhaps even a perceptual solipsism, wherein the perceiving subject is the sole measure of the real, independent of another subject or consent. While it is in the first instance - with its necessary violence in the erasure of novel experience, homologizing and analogizing, compromising phenomena into the agora of language - that we locate Carlos's request for consent: "As birds do?"; it is in the second - with its risk of precluding other subjects, reduced, at worst, to mere objects or, at best, subjects in potentia - that benefactor don Juan locates personal power: "No, he flies as a man who has taken the weed"; "That is what you told me. Didn't you?" (129). In devil order his to due appease by entertaining character-Carlos's the consensus incessant model demands of truth, for let assent us, then, and dredge to give the the devil his due by entertaining the consensus model of truth, let us, then, dredge the archive for historical experiments of the flying ointment that might affirm or dispel Castaneda's findings.</page><page sequence="7">David M J. Carruthers 125 The earliest of these experiments recorded in the Western tradition, Luceius's transformation in the ca. 160 CE Metamorphoses , comes from the Roman philoso- pher, orator, and prose-writer Apuleius, notoriously tried (and exonerated) for witch- craft, ca. 158 CE, for his suspicious acquisition of the wealthy widow Pudentilla of Oea ("Apologia"). Apuleius belonged to several of the Greco-Roman mystery cults, including the ecstatic Dionysian Mysteries and the Cult of Isis. It is initiation into the latter that transforms Luceius, the protagonist of the Metamorphoses , back from an ass into his human form. On the means of becoming an ass, Apuleius writes, Fotis, on a certain day, ran to me, agitated and trembling exceedingly, and informed me that her mistress, because she had not hitherto made any proficiency in her amours, by other arts, would, on the following night, assume wings, and be changed into a bird, and would, thus transformed, fly to the object of her love. I cautiously, therefore, prepared myself for the survey of a thing of such importance. And now, towards the beginning of the night, Fotis brought me, with doubtful and silent steps, to that lofty chamber, and ordered me to look through a certain chink of the door, that I might see what was transacted. And, in the first place, indeed, Pamphile divested herself of all her garments; and having opened a cer- tain small chest, took from thence many boxes, from one of which the covering being removed, she rubbed herself, for a long time, with an ointment contained in it, from the extremities of her feet to the crown of her head. When, also, with the lamp in her hand, she had said much in a low voice, she shook her limbs with a tremulous agitation; and from these, lightly fluctuating, soft feathers extend themselves, and strong wings burst forth, the nose is hardened and incurvated, the nails are compressed and made crooked, and Pamphile becomes an owl. Being thus changed, and emitting a querulous sound, she made a trial of herself, and gradually leapt from the earth; and soon after, being raised on high, she flew out of doors, with all the force of her wings. Thus she, indeed, was voluntarily changed, by her own magic arts. (45-46) Though shapeshifting, the transfiguration of the physical body, is not uncommon among popular recollections of the experience under the nightshade, Castañeda describes no such radical animal transformation in his report: for don Juan explains to young Carlos that his body was "in the bushes" ( Teachings 129). While there is no direct indication in Apuleius of the ingredients of Pamphile's flying ointment, one can implicate the nightshade family, Solanaceaey by correlating other similar historical flights that do identify the nightshade as an active ingredient. That the psychotropic (and medicinal) properties of the nightshade were well-known to the scholars of Classical antiquity, and more specifically to the Platonist school under which Apuleius studied, comes to us through Theophrastus, writing in the 4th century BCE, and Dioscorides, writing between 50 CE and 70 CE - both describing</page><page sequence="8">126 Mosaic 48/2 (June 2015) the qualities of the family strychnos: the Classical Greek adjective, used substantively here, meaning acrid or bitter , specializing into the Latin to exclusively denote the nightshade family. Incidentally, the acrid or bitter quality of plants is attributable to high alkaloid content: in the Solanaceae family, these are the psychoactive scopo- lamine , atropine , and hyoscyamine , serving the plant in its evolutionary complexity as a powerful herbicidal, insecticidal, and generally pesticidal cocktail. Theophrastus, in his Enquiry into Plants and Minor Works on Odours and Weather Signs , explains, Of the plants called strykhnos one induces sleep, the other (thorn-apple) causes madness. [. . .] The "bark" of the root of this they bruise severely, and soaking it in neat wine give it as a draught, and it induces sleep. It grows in water-courses and on tombs. The kind which produces madness [. . .] has a white hollow root about a cubit long. Of this three twentieths of an ounce in weight is given, if the patient is to become merely sportive and to think himself a fine fellow; twice this dose if he is to go mad outright and have delusions; thrice the dose if he is to be permanently insane; [. . .] four times the dose is given, if the man is to be killed. (IX.xi: 5-6) And, Dioscorides, in De Materia Medica , imitates, "It grows in hilly places open to the wind, and among rocks near the sea. A teaspoon of a decoction of the root [. . .] is able to effect not unpleasant fantasies. Two teaspoonfuls of a decoction make one beside himself for three days, and four will kill him" (IV: 73). Note that in these two accounts of the effects of the nightshade, Theophrastus's Enquiry into Plants and Dioscorides's De Materia Medica - one, a taxonomical study; the other, a pharmacopoeia - there is no mention of the experience of flight in the subject. In fact, both maintain a presumably objective, that is external perspective on the effects of the nightshade: a point emphasized with Theophrastus's use of the verb construction "is given," assuming a hegemonic position over a subaltern other to whom the plant is administered - for the nightshade suppresses speech in its host - as opposed to a self- authorizing subject who takes the nightshade. This externalized perspective, speaking on behalf of a subdued patient, regards the experience of the nightshade strictly in terms of its soporific, narcotic, deliriant, and deleterious effects, isolating and confining the phenom- ena to the exclusively internal territory of dreams and madness - so much epistemological cargo too hastily jettisoned by the rationalist and realist proclivities of Western thought. Very few of the historical authors of this phenomenon of herbal flight are so for- tunate as to report from both sides of this insoluble magical formula; with the excep- tion of very few, observers are either privy to the inside or outside and adamantly defend the position from which they were introduced to the plant.</page><page sequence="9">David M J. Carruthers 127 Abraham of Worms, alternately Abraham ben Simeon, writing sometime between 1387 and 1427, is just such an anomaly, revealing in his grimoire, The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage, as delivered by Abraham the Jew unto his son Lamech , that At Lintz I worked with a young woman, who one evening invited me to go with her, assur- ing me that without any risk she would conduct me to a place where I greatly desired to find myself. [. . .] She then gave unto me an unguent, with which I rubbed the principal pulses of my feet and hands; the which she did also; and at first it appeared to me that I was flying in the air in the place which I wished, and which I had in no way mentioned to her. [. . .] However, I asked her one day to go alone to that same place, and to bring me back news of a friend [. . .] She rubbed herself with the same unguent, and I was very expectant to see her fly away; but she fell to the ground and remained there about three hours as if she were dead, so that I began to think she really was dead. [. . .] Whence I concluded that what she had just told me was a simple dream, and that this unguent was a causer of phan- tastic sleep. (Simeon I: vi) Abraham, writing to his son in admonition against the Devil's dark arts, of various chicanery and ineffectual ritual, in favour of Cabbalistic incantation and prayer, the summoning of angels and daemons for good purposes, decides that, because of the ambivalence of the nightshade's flight - the competing phenomena of corporeal flight and phantastic sleep - that the latter is to be privileged, despite his first-hand encounter with the other. For brevity's sake, and not to overburden the point, it suffices to say that there are several other attempts addressing this perceptual problem, coming from both points on the perspectivai paradigm - including Galileo's contemporary, Giambattista della Porta, in his Magia Naturalis ; the surprisingly sober reflections of witch-hunter Nicolas Remy in Demonolatry; to the most recent representations of the powers of the nightshade, including German photographer Gustav Schenk's henbane flight in the Book of Poisons. Incidentally, they are from these two competing perspectives of this plant-human intersection - the first-person observation of flight against the third- person observation of mortal slumber - that spring the originary iconographies of both the witch in flight upon her broomstick, oft regarded as the phallic means of suppository application of the ointment,6 and the resurrection of the corpse in the undead zombie. Raphael Holinshed, most likely the source text through which this image of the witch in flight upon the broomstick is popularized,7 in his Chronicles of Ireland , amends our knowledge of Ledrede's A Contemporary Narrative of the Proceedings</page><page sequence="10">128 Mosaic 48/2 (June 2015) against Dame Alice Kyteler, Prosecuted for Sorcery in 1324 , drawing from "the Annales Hiberniae , printed by Camden, (Britannia, Ed. 1607, p. 818) apparently a mere com- pilation of the fifteenth century, and not very correct" (Wright 46), adding that, after Kyteler 's flight from Ireland to England and out of the annals of history, "In rifling the closet of the ladie [Kyteler], they found a wafer of sacramental bread, having the divels name stamped thereon in steed of Jesus Christ, and a pipe of ointment, wherewith she greased a staffe, upon which she ambled and galloped thorough thicke and thin, when and in what manner she listed" (58). Wade Davis's most recent investigative anthropology into the source of the Haitian voudon ritual of raising the dead, the enslaving of souls made subject to pow- erful sorcerers, in The Serpent and the Rainbow, while ultimately inconclusive, strongly suspects the datura nightshade as the toxicological source of this ancient magic - knowledge carried from Africa by colonial slaves: a magic so powerful as to resonate in every manifestation of the witch or zombie in the popular imagination since. While many of these reports of the nightshade, in the words of della Porta, "mix in a great deal of superstition" (II: xxvi), whether hearsay or heresy, they are far too numerous and varied a sample of the potential, the power of the topically applied ointment to produce in its applicants the experience of flight and trans- or tele- portation, to merely disregard or discredit these phenomena as simply sleep-induced dream and deliria. Furthermore, the experience of the witch's flight is deficient in the quintessential quality of absurdity , as asserted in Thomas Hobbes's Leviathan , so oft requisite to the dreamscape and all-too-familiar to the dreamer upon waking. This is not, of course, to suggest that such flights are not the very essence of absurdity, but that they are only so in direct relation to the contradictory perspective of the third person. Abraham of Worms, after all, reports being "really and corporeally in the place" of assignation (Simeon I: vi). Even Freud's Interpretation of Dreams cannot touch upon the nightshade vision, for the phenomena lack the very condensation, the codification that would allow them to be read symbolically; desire is met unimpeded by the aviator in his or her arrival at the intended destination: the sorcerer's flight is asemiotic, representative only of itself. In a like manner, the plant-soul, in all its desiring, expresses desire in its being met. That is, the root, desirous of liquid and mineral nourishment, desires by probing the earth whereby it is nourished; the leaf, in desiring solar energy, unfolds into daylight. There is no distanciation between the plant and its object of desire; in the object's absence, it fails and ceases desiring. This is not to say, however, that the nightshade merely produces in its applicant the experience of the object of desire, a flight of fancy, as though it were the magic mirror of Goethe's Faust or the amnesia of</page><page sequence="11">David M J. Carruthers 129 the Homeric lotus-eaters. For many report experiences, equally as lucid and corpo- real, that could only be summarized as unwelcome, hellish nightmares: perceptions of the body splayed open, a world and body ablaze, populated by insects and the reani- mated corpses of beasts in decay8 - not the materialization of the death-drive, a well- sought cessation of desire, but a continuation of life beyond its corporeal confines. The firsthand reports of the experience of the nightshade, whether flight, folly, or phantasm, signal a sort of plant communication: a dialectic of experience produced, and reproducible, at the point of plant-human intersection. In a strong materialist turn in the apprehension of "the language of plants," and thereby "plant-thinking," Michael Marder, in his text of the same name, acknowledges that, "Aside from communicating their distress when predators are detected in the vicinity by releasing airborne (or in some cases below-ground) chemicals, plants, like all living beings, articulate themselves spatially; in a body language free from gestures, 'they can express themselves only by their postures [ils ne s'expriment que par leurs poses]"' (75). The flight induced by the nightshade - topical in both its application and its magical expression - suggests an extension of the plant that moves beyond its material, chemical expression in the body. In all its own material immobility, the nightshade expresses itself in the human by sending it away, extending the range of its influence far, far beyond both the plant's and the human's immediate proximity. Returning to Castañedas appeal for confirmation of his flight, it becomes impos- sible, in consideration of this assembly of aviators, to deny it him, even and especially considering the observance of his "body [. . .] in the bushes" - not so small an impedi- ment for those who might otherwise unreservedly take the leap of faith into the sor- cerer's abysmal belief. The sorcerer's vision evokes, conjures up the necessity for a phenomenological approach to flight, privileging the subject's deeply and richly per- sonal sensory experience of the environment, of the "world" - for "the experience of perception is our presence at the moment when things, truths, values are constituted for us; that perception is a nascent logos ; that it teaches us, outside all dogmatism, the true conditions of objectivity itself; that it summons us to the tasks of knowledge and action" (Merleau-Ponty, Primacy 25). And yet, the marked continuity of the physical body with the perceived world, essential and primary to Maurice Merleau-Ponty - intersubjectivity and the Flesh-of-the-world ( Visible ) - fails, split open by this meta- morphosis, the shedding of the flesh and the yawning chasm carved between the sen- sate corpse and its perceptual capacity. In short, the plane of consistency is rent inconsistent. The witches' flight annuls the contract binding sense and sensibility, and otherwise unfolds the in-folding of the perceptual environment to the body by aban- doning the body itself - fleeing the fold in experience of disembodied perception, of flight.</page><page sequence="12">130 Mosaic 48/2 (June 2015) The strange plant, convergence, then, as well this as the human-vegetal human, oversteps assembly. its own The material plant, embodying limitations "an in inte- this strange convergence, this human-vegetal assembly. The plant, embodying "an inte- riority immediately identical to the process of exteriorization" (Marder 41), in pro- ducing a vegetative human body, immobilized on the floor or "in the bushes," exacerbates human interiority, paradoxically, by moving it to the outside. It is from this privileged, this damned, this mad, this anomalous position, out- side of the fold - at the edge of the pack, at the Sabbath just beyond town, at the "crack between the worlds" ( Teachings 185), and where the imagined distinctions between human, plant, and animal become blurred, even eradicated - that the sor- cerer operates, subverting and deterritorializing the established limits of knowledge, supplanting them with the wisdom of the outside : an irreconcilable question, a line of flight that necessarily demands new assemblages, new constellations and calendars that might better reflect the course of the heavens and its wandering bodies. It is pre- cisely within this clearing exposed between the witch in flight and the somnambulant corpse that "plants quietly subvert classical philosophical hierarchies and afford us a glimpse into a lived (and growing) destruction of Western metaphysics" (Marder 53). NOTES 1/ In the later texts, Castañeda renounces his dependence on psychotropics as the source of one's personal power, instead emphasizing their import in initially transforming one's perception of the world in order to embark on the journey toward becoming a "man of knowledge." 2/ Investigative reporters discovered Castañeda engaged in polygamy in the years leading up to his death. 3/ Most likely the foremost cause of the growing disbelief in his work. 4/ See Castaneda's Teachings (154) and de Mille's Castaneda's Journey (42). 5/It is worth noting here that de Mille never once takes issue with the most radical claims made by Castañeda, viz. his non-ordinary experiences with and without the aid of his power-plant allies.
