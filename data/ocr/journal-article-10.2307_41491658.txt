U.N.Y. In Historia personal del boom 1 José Donoso gives the impression of being the one left out of the moveable feast of his contemporaries, a late-comer to the feast of panthers and literary lions. The writer's nearly self-imposed marginality becomes a privilege which allows him to distance himself from others of his "generation," not a bad move for a writer. In Donoso's novels the elusive, marginal character of the narrative voice allows the writer to construct the text even as he questions the very process of its production. Such ironic questioning, characteristic of the novel, goes hand in hand with the relative acceptance and sometimes acclaim that a published novel brings to a writer in the literary marketplace. By contrast, the handwritten journal comes to the reader in another medium. The relative privacy of the scrawled text seems closer to the body, less oblique than the printed language of fiction. The handwritten text suggests a hierarchy of writing based on the alibi of the author. The manuscript, a marginal text, presents a writing subject which seems closer to the body, more "real." The novel, canonized or canonizable, presents the fragmented subject of modern fiction. Yet the handwritten text may merely present another version of the same subject, ever fragmented in the search for the complicity of the reader. Having left the privacy of personal ownership, Donoso's notebooks at Princeton's Library invite such speculation on the characteristics of the writing subject that they reveal.2 1 (Barcelona: Editorial Anagrama, 1972).

The published novel means an entrance, or at least a foot in the door, into the literary marketplace, with its privileges and compromises. The journal, on the other hand, belongs to the realm of the private, the subjective; it is temporarily removed from the scrutiny of the reader, from this one's gaze or that other one's wallet. The two documents, the handwritten journal and the published novel, define a kind of frontier between the possible utopia of a scribbled, subjective discourse and the hard- edged realm of the printed, the priced commodity bought by the eager reader, as if printing defined not merely a literary reputation, but also a passage from the space of writing to that of reading. Specially interesting are the notebooks written while Donoso struggled to complete El obsceno pájaro , an enterprise which he admits obsessed him to the point of insanity. Reading over the notes, one may wonder if the scribbled pages could represent a kind of backdoor to the writer's world. Perhaps the downhome scrawl contains something missing from the neat rows of print in the novel. To read someone's private notes is considered a violation, possibly a legal one, certainly a moral one; but once these notes become part of a library's collection, they almost require a reading. In Notebook 43, Donoso comments on a project to write "el revés del pájaro," the other side of El obsceno pájaro . Several of the notebooks deal with the writing of this novel, and they present in a sense the other side of the finished work. Donoso outlines the plot of the novel as it progresses, comments on the characters, sets deadlines for himself, agonizes over them, and describes the difficulty of achieving a particular effect in some carefully constructed narrative scenario. The workaday side of writing surfaces in the notebooks: the deadlines, the repairs on the typewriter. In Notebook 37 in bold red ink, there is an account of the author's financial situation: money in the bank, money coming in from the English edition of This Sunday . In the cracks of this biographical discourse, Donoso comments on his ideas about personality, about characterization and its practice in the narrative. It is as if for the writer there were no radical separation between the discourse of the narrative and the private discourse, the marginal day-to-day absent from the published fictional work. It is as if the I in the notebook were as elusive at times as the constantly shifting narrative persona of El obsceno pájaro de la noche , as if for the writer, the limit between the private note and the finished work were not a limit at all but an area of transition where a hierarchy of texts does not hold. One approach to the notebooks would be to read them as a complement to the novels. The note would be the other side of the creative process, seen only darkly in the novel. Another approach may be to read in the frayed discourse of the notebooks the traces of a subject never solid and never complete, always in transit to the next scrawl. It is a movement which may be associated with a recurring theme in Donoso's work, that of the dissociation of the personality, the lack of unity of the individual dispersed in the discourses that constitute him</page><page sequence="3">WRITING ON THE MARGIN: JOSE DONOSO'S NOTEBOOKS 193 or her. In a 1971 interview Donoso refers to "la unidad psicologica" as ese mito horrible que nos hemos inventado y que hoy día ya se está viendo que no vale siquiera la pena, nada de nada, hablar de él. Entonces, llegar a la conclusión y llegar a la vivencia de esta no-unidad del ser humano, causa horribles angustias y horribles dolores: significa la destrucción de 'patterns' de vida, de esquemas de comportamiento; significa la necesidad de volver a construir mil cosas.3 The notebooks record the process of such a splintering of the personality, one which can lead to despair or to renewal. But if the anguish and pain of such a process are presented obliquely in the novel, the notebooks do not give these emotions a more direct form of expression. Anguish and pain in the notes do not take the form of the language of despair. The despair recorded in the notebooks is really a fear, the fear of the absence of language. If a novel such as El obsceno pájaro simulates chaos, it is in fact the most orderly of worlds, and what the notebooks record, more than a private version of an exorcism through art, is the struggle to find the best order for a certain chain of narrative events. The notebooks record not so much the fear of a madness which has at times haunted Donoso as the writer's dread of the blockage of language. As long as the words continue, the fear is deferred. Real madness, the dissolution of the personality into a dreaded silence, is transformed through writing into the legible pattern of the narrative. It is a narrative in which the writing subject is removed from "ese mito horrible" of the unity of the human being and endowed with a liberating plurality. In the notebooks Donoso records the making of fictional characters as well as the making of himself as a subject realized in the activity of writing, an activity that becomes its own reward, that allows the writer to go on: "seguir adelante sin miedo - a pesar de que estoy helado de terror", (Notebook 37). In Donoso's writing the idea of a corporeal authority, removed from his work and setting order to it from the outside, yields to a notion of the text as the place where writing is the pleasure of a "body" offered to the reader, whose complicity the writer demands in order to complete the pact of fiction. In Notebook 37 Donoso writes of the depression he feels because for five days his "body" has been away from its work, from writing. Away from work, the writer may be either mad or depressed or out playing tennis as ordered by the doctor. But it is in the work that he sets out to build a legible body, a sensible one. Even in the notebooks, it is as if the writer would ban the man named Donoso from entering the realm of the written. To let him enter is already to alter, to mutate him, to transform him into another fiction. 3 "La novela como Happening: Una entrevista de Emir Rodríguez Monegal sobre El obsceno pájaro de la noche ," (Interview with Emir Rodríguez Monegal), Revista Iberoamericana , (julio-dic. 1971), nos. 76-77, p. 525.</page><page sequence="4">194 OSCAR MONTERO The notebooks show that for Donoso the process of building a character is also a subjective process. He feels the changes in a character in his own body. He writes of Jerónimo, the wealthy aristocrat of el obsceno pájaro : Esta idea borgiana [sic], debo desarrollarla. Todo lo que NO elegí para mi Jerónimo, me quedo, veo, yo, testigo, vivente, lleno de ello. Me llena y se estanca y se hincha dentro de mí, y me duele, me deforma - y finalmente, me define, y al definirme, define también qué voy a elegir de Jerónimo y da otra vuelta la rueda. Bonita idea, que desde luego, usaré y desarrollaré. (Notebook 37, pp. 2-3). What is left of the character in the writer deforms him and hurts him, but ultimately defines him, and defines him precisely in the process of writing the notebook. In Notebook 37, Donoso identifies the sewing up of all the bodily orifices of "el Mudito" in El obsceno pájaro with the arduous process of writing the novel, which he cannot find a way to finish. He writes, No veo la hora de salir de este atolladero INFERNAL en que me encuentro metido sin salida de ninguna clase ni para ningún lado. Estoy trancado, (p. 36) The writer's block is treated by reading Paradiso or Fuentes. The notebooks in turn provide an alternative writing space that does not necessarily prefigure the writing in the novel but that becomes its complement, metaphorically a more private, more disorganized realm, removed from the taxing rigors of fiction. The hermetism of El Mudito is associated in the notebooks with the inability to go on writing the novel; there is also a parallel between the activity of writing and the literary frustrations of El obsceno pájaro* s Humberto Peñaloza. In the notebooks it is difficult to tell if Donoso is writing a fragment of this character's dialogue or if he is writing about himself: Tarde de cal en el patio de los santos: como el maquillaje teatral después de una función, voy a quemarlo todo. Por eso me salió este cuaderno, era lo último mío que quedaba afuera. Durante años, fíjese, he ido robando libros. Ahora sí que voy a estar completo. (Notebook 37, p. 15) In the novel the writer Humberto remains trapped, swallowed up by the cardboard figures he admires. The writer's impasse dramatized by Humberto and his mute double is what Donoso himself must overcome. He writes in Notebook 37, p. 102, "demostrarse a sí mismo que el mundo de Jerónimo no tiene atractivo ni vigencia." The world of Jerónimo is the "real" world in El obsceno pájaro , the world of power, of images without words; and it is this world, peopled with anthropomorphic emblems, that is, if not destroyed, certainly deferred, displaced by the unraveling of the tale. In El obsceno pájaro</page><page sequence="5">WRITING ON THE MARGIN: JOSE DONOSO'S NOTEBOOKS 195 the power of the narrator's shifting point of view overrides the illusory power of the perfect couple, Jerónimo and his wife, the heirs of the oligarchy whose history the novel parodies and subverts. Likewise, the notebooks display a power, a significance, that does not depend so much on a biographical absence that would lend them its authority as it does on the graphic activity which they record, perhaps the only possible biography to which a writer has access. There is in the notebooks a conception of personality which parallels the approach to characterization used by Donoso. The first person in El obsceno pájaro shifts from one character to another, lingering at the end on El Mudito, sewn up into a bundle by the old women. At the end of the novel, the narrator writes, "He recuperado entera mi claridad. Se ordena mi pensamiento otra vez y cae hasta el fondo de mi transparencia donde su luz desentraña los últimos miedos y ambigüedades enfundadas: soy este paquete" (p. 537). The layers which completely hide the character finally are that character, "el contenido de un envolvente ... no vacío sino vaciado," like Barthes' Japonese gift.4 Donoso's idea of characterization and personality as a multiplicity of languages is correlative to a lack of unity that is ultimately to be celebrated, not mourned. Referring to characterization, Donoso comments on the idea of human beings as constructed from layers, "capas," "película de goma inflada, una careta de cartonpiedra con la cara pintada." In the same notebook (37), he adds, "Yo soy todas las personas que imagino - yo he sido todo lo que he logrado imaginar" (p. 33). This "idea borgiana," as he calls it, recurs throughout the notebooks, perhaps another "layer" spun by Donoso. For him, the act of writing is hardly an act of liberating creation; rather it is an activity tainted by worries which might be called petty if they were not necessary, "sórdidas maquinaciones" he calls them, about deadlines, about possible reviews, about money. For the writer pleasure will come at the moment of reading, an act in which he can only be present through a perverse kind of proxy. It is somehow disconcerting to consider that the same man who penned El obsceno pájaro is this man who schemes to get a review of his book written by a stellar figure in an American magazine. It would be pointless to set one against the other and demand an explanation. The crafted ambiguity of the novel also surfaces in the notebooks. Even in their relative privacy, they reveal no definitive /, as if the first person of the writer were always destined to flow into that of a character in the making. The notebooks suggest that this nearly involuntary unfolding is not peculiar to any one genre, but that it is characteristic of the writing process itself.5 The writer is the one who celebrates in his work what other discourses may judge as shattering: the dissolution of the personality, the emptying of the self, the banishment of its obsessive monologues, its symbolic 4 Severo Sarduy, "El arte narrativo de José Donoso: Regalo japonés, crónica goyesca, lugar sin límites," La cultura en México (Suplemento Siempre ), no. 965 (diciembre 22, 1971), II.

The notebooks reconstruct fragments of an interior world of self-doubt, insecurity, jealousy, a world that ultimately leads to the dreaded absence of writing. For the writer, the tale of his "sordid" schemes, the lists of home repairs, the naive figurings of the do-it-yourself accountant are preferable to the blank page. For Donoso to write is to be lucid; outside the written page there may be madness, represented perhaps in the unintelligible scrawls that appear in some of the notebooks, as if the scribble were a transition not so much between sense and non-sense as between the possibility of sense and the feared absence of all tracings. If for Donoso writing has been at times a kind of disease, it has ultimately been a healing disease. After the publication of El obsceno pájaro , he said, "la terminé en diciembre del año pasado, y todavía estoy convaleciendo de ella."6 But in a later interview he says, "Yo creo que la tarea de escribir es la mayor lucidez que uno puede tener."7 The notebooks affirm that ultimately, as in the Bunraku theatre described by Barthes; "le travail se substitue a l'intériorité."8 The activity of writing, ordering, sorting, even sharpening pencils, replaces or at least defers the interior, private world of the individual, a mute world, full of mystery for some, but for the writer full of a kind of dread which only the word, sublime or banal, can soothe. If one were to pursue a metaphor of psychological depth, the notebook may seem to lead to a non-verbal world of madness, to the inaccessible boundaries of language, to the scrawl, the garabatos that appear in some of the notebooks, a kind of emblem of an illusory pure signifier. But where the notebooks lead us is back to the writer's work, to the doubling worlds of El obsceno pájaro , to the trompe l'oeil parody of Casa de campo , to the mock biographical El jardín de al lado , to that continued search of the writer not so much for the exorcism of private demons through art as for the pleasure of the shared realm of reading, which is the same as the renewal of writing, its continuous project. In a sense, the notebooks are that other novel, those other novels that Donoso has never written or has yet to write. "OTRA NOVELA," is the title of one of the fragments, in which the writer goes on to explain, "La de identidades que se van multiplicando", adding in English, "Keep this in mind" (Notebook 39, p. 73). Donoso's novels are now finished projects, but in their frayed state the notebooks represent the desire for "that other novel," the life project of a writer to create for himself a literary visage. "Hay tan pocas máscaras," Donoso writes, que a lo largo de las generaciones mueren las personas, y otras las substituyen en el uso de esas pocas máscaras. Las gentes son intercambiables, sin importancia, las máscaras, eternas, compatibles, se presetan, se compran, se roban, se heredan, no se 6 "La novela como Happening," p. 527. 7 Nelly Martínez, "Entrevista: José Donoso," Hispamérica , VII, no. 21 (diciembre 1978), 59. 8 L'empire des signes (Geneva: Skira, 1970), p. 83.</page><page sequence="7">WRITING ON THE MARGIN: JOSE DONOSO'S NOTEBOOKS 197 pierden jamás, mientras bajo ellas, van cayendo individuos que creían haber amado o creado o sufrido, amor, creación, sufrimiento que se pierde y se muere, mientras la máscara, la persona, se eterniza porque es un objeto, y los objetos no mueren, a no ser que se destrocen . . . Hay pocas máscaras: a mí no me tocó ninguna, nací sin rostro, y e [sic] emigrado por todas partes para buscar una máscara, pero no dan abasto. (Notebook 41, p. 141) For Donoso writing must be not the lament of a lost unity but the vigorous search for those mutliple masks, each text becoming another layer, otra capa. Like Barthes' Japanese cook, once the work is finished, it is the writer who can say to the reader, "you are the one who has eaten, but it is he who has played, who has written, who has produced." Donoso's literary works turn into fiction the dispersion of the subject in a language that duplicates the mechanisms of play and thus insures the verisimilitude of fiction by demanding the participation of the reader.9 The notebooks contain the graphic traces of the writer's search for his common reader; they display the quirks of writing still close to the idiosyncracies of the hand, not yet packaged in the marketable finality of the printed volume. They display what may be Donoso's, perhaps his generation's profoundest nostalgia, not the nostalgia of time or place but that of writing, of scribbling on the edge of print, as if the prestige of the published marked for the writer a defeat, the end of writing and the ineluctable entrance into the marketplace of priced things. It is the self-conscious defeat of the moderns, which is also a sort of triumph, the end of writing yet the beginning of reading, of a lovers' truce on the edge of inevitable, often harsh and grating realities. 9 Ricardo Gutiérrez Mouat, José Donoso: impostura e impostación (Gaithersburg, MD: Ediciones Hispamérica, 1983), pp. 188-189.</page></plain_text>
