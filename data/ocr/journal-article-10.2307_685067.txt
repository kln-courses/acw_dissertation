While only a small proportion of married women participate in the labor force in South Korea, the vast majority of Korean immigrant wives work outside the home, most working long hours. Parallel to the increase in Korean women's economic role, their husbands' provider role and social status have significantly weak- ened with immigration. Despite Korean women's increase in their economic role, most Korean husbands have not modified a rigid form of patriarchal ideology brought from Korea because they are socially segregated from the mainstream society. A big clash between Korean women's active economic role and their husbands' traditional patriarchal attitudes causes serious marital conflicts in many Korean immigrant families. In addition, Korean partners' (particularly husbands') frustrations over their downward social mobility, the long hours spent together in the family store, and their midlife crisis are additional causes of marital conflicts. Other contemporary immigrant groups, mostly from non-European, Third World countries, seem to encounter lower, but similar marital conflicts caused by sudden changes in women's gender role.

Not surprisingly, new immigrant groups experience enormous changes in family life. One of the major changes that contemporary immigrants experience in the family sys- tem is the increased participation of married women in the labor force. Although a small proportion of married women work in most of these Third World countries, many non-white immigrant groups show high female labor force participation rates, even higher than non-Hispanic whites (Chow, 1994; Ferre, 1979; Foner, 1986, 1998; Kibria, 1993; Perez, 1986; Sluzki, 1979; Stier, 1991). This change is not surprising at all, considering immigrant women's greater motivation to participate in the labor force resulting from the gap in the standard of living between the home and host societies. The participation of a married woman in the labor force increases the likelihood of her marital conflict and marital instability (Booth et al., 1984; Cherlin, 1981; Moore and Hofferth, 1979; Rubin, 1983; Spitze, 1988; Spitze and South, 1985). It increases the wife's marital conflict and insta- bility, particularly when her employment entails working long hours and/or contributing to a significant proportion of the family income (Menaghan and Parcel, 1990). The division of house labor is a major source of mari- tal conflict (Kluwer et al., 1996; Pleck, 1985). The wife's long hours of paid work and her great contribution to the family economy increase the likeli- hood of marital conflict about the division of housework. Her new role puts pressure on her husband to spend more time on housework. Moreover, role reversal usually hurts the husband's ego, which may lead him to react to his wife violently. Role reversal contributes to marital tensions and violence, particularly when the husband maintains traditional gender role attitudes (Rubin, 1983). The economic role of married women in the United States has gradually increased since World War II, partly as a result of their and their husbands' increasing liberalization of gender role attitudes, although they, too, suf- fer from cultural lag. By contrast, immigrant women's economic role has increased suddenly, dictated by the exigencies for their economic survival, without changing their own and their husbands' traditional patriarchal cus- toms brought with them from their home countries. Although immigrant wives participate in the labor force, not from their feminist consciousness of increasing their marital power and social status, their increased economic role has inevitably increased their bargaining power. Despite this change, the immigrant husbands stick to the traditional patriarchal authority, not ready 302 Min</page><page sequence="3">Changes in Korean Immigrants to increase their share of housework and reduce their patriarchal authority. Thus their traditional gender role attitudes severely clash with the reality. Several studies have indicated that the increase in immigrant wives' economic role with no significant change in their husbands' gender role at- titudes has caused marital conflicts and tensions (Gold, 1989, 1995:36-38; Kibria, 1990,1993; Lim, 1997; Mahler, 1995:107; Park, 1997:132,133; Pessar, 1995:56-72; Rubin, 1994; Sluzki, 1979). Kibria (1993), for example, shows that the increase in Vietnamese women's control over economic and social resources, and the concomitant decline in their husbands' earning power and social status brought about conflicts in their marital relations. Pessar (1995:58) made similar comments on marital conflicts in Dominican immi- grant families in New York City: "Prolonged male unemployment, com- bined with men's insistence on maintaining the perks of male privilege in the household, can also lead to marital discord...." Mahler (1995:107) also documented that Salvadorian immigrant women's increased economic role enhanced their bargaining power at home, but that the latter became a new source of tensions in marital relations when their husbands expected their wives to serve them meals. Most new contemporary immigrant groups encounter the problem of marital tensions caused by the discrepancy between women's increased eco- nomic role and persistence of traditional gender role attitudes. Yet different immigrant groups encounter differential levels of discrepancy between gen- der role behavior and attitudes because they differ both in the level of the patriarchal ideology brought from their home country and in the degree of preserving it in the United States. Koreans are one of the few immigrant groups who experience a high level of discrepancy between women's in- creased economic role and persistence of traditional gender role attitudes. While most Korean immigrant wives are active in their economic role, the structure of the Korean immigrant community has hindered Korean immi- grants, particularly men, from modifying the patriarchal ideology that they brought with them from Korea. As a result, many Korean immigrant couples experience a high level of conflict in their marital relations. This paper examines the effects of the discrepancy between Korean immigrants' changes in gender role behavior (women's increased economic role and the concomitant decline in their husbands' economic power and status) and persistence of their husbands' traditional gender role attitudes on their marital conflicts. The first section intends to show how the eco- nomic structure of the Korean community has enabled Korean immigrant women to play an important economic role and has weakened their hus- bands' economic power and status. The second section will examine how Korean immigrants' social segregation hinders them from modifying the pa- triarchal ideology they brought with them from Korea. The third and final 303</page><page sequence="4">section will examine how the sudden increase in Korean immigrant wives' economic role without significant changes in their husbands' gender role attitudes has increased their marital conflicts. DATA SOURCES This paper is based on the following four data sources: (1) a telephone interview with 297 Korean immigrant women in New York City, (2) in-depth, personal and telephone interviews with 31 married or divorced women and men, (3) discussions with two social workers, and (4) the author's participant observation. A telephone survey was conducted in 1988, utilizing the Kim sample technique in sampling Korean households in New York City (Shin and Yu, 1984). Approximately 22% of Koreans have the surname Kim (National Bureau of Statistics, 1977). Kim is a uniquely Korean surname and Kims represent the Korean population socioeconomically (Shin and Yu, 1984). Therefore, a relatively unbiased sample of Korean households can be ob- tained through sampling Kims from local telephone directories. Six hundred and fifty Kim households were randomly selected from the five 1988 New York City public telephone directories. Only Korean women who were married immigrants were asked to be in- terviewed. Of the selected households, 125 were not eligible for the interview because they were either nonmarital or nonimmigrant households. Only one married woman from each household (the wife of the household head) was interviewed. A total of 298 Korean women from the 525 eligible households (56.8%) were successfully interviewed by telephone. The interview sched- ule included 54 items, almost all closed-ended. The interview items focused on the respondents' and their husbands' background information, economic activities, share of housework, marital power, and gender role attitudes. Tape-recorded personal interviews with 18 Korean immigrant women and men-all but one married-and telephone interviews with additional 13 married Korean women and men in New York were conducted to in- vestigate the dynamics of marital relations, with a focus on marital conflict and child socialization. Almost all interviews were conducted using a loosely structured, open-ended questionnaire, adjusting questions to fit the special characteristics of each respondent. Most interviews were conducted between June 1996 and February 1997, with four respondents being interviewed in January and February 1998. Personal interviews lasted from 30 min to 1 h. Personal interviews with these married Korean immigrants have provided the major qualitative data that are indispensable to documenting marital conflicts, the main focus of this paper. I have used pseudonyms to protect the privacy of interviewees. 304 Min</page><page sequence="5">Changes in Korean Immigrants In order to understand Korean immigrants' marital relations better, I also interviewed two directors of the Korean American family counsel- ing centers in New York, who offered me many anecdotes about Korean immigrants' marital conflicts. Finally, my insider's knowledge of Korean immigrant families in the form of participant observation is a valuable source of data for this paper. My casual observations of Korean immigrant fami- lies, my informal discussions with Korean social workers, and my reading of Korean ethnic newspaper articles have sensitized me to the role rever- sals and the pervasiveness and seriousness of conflicts and tensions in many Korean immigrant families. KOREAN WOMEN'S INCREASED ECONOMIC ROLE IN THE ETHNIC ECONOMY Confucianism, which originated in China, began to have a powerful cul- tural influence in Korea during the Chosun dynasty (1392-1910) when the government adopted it as a social, political, and economic philosophy (Park and Cho, 1995). Confucian ideology accorded men the dominant position and thus helped to establish an extreme form of patriarchy in Korea. In tradi- tional Korean society, the husband was considered the primary breadwinner and decision maker in the family and exercised authority over his wife and children. The wife was expected to obey her husband, devotedly serving him and his kin, and to perpetuate her husband's lineage by bearing children. High levels of industrialization and Westernization since the 1960s have modified the traditional family system in South Korea. However, there has been no significant change in patriarchy and gender inequality based on Con- fucian ideology. Both traditional gender role expectations and employment discrimination continue to discourage married women from participating in the labor market. Only 17% of 15-64-years-old Korean married women in urban areas participated in the labor force in 1980 (Park, 1990:116). The mar- ried women's labor force participation rate increased to approximately 25 % in 1990 (National Statistical Office, 1993:1), still much lower than those in the United States and other Western industrialized countries. Although many women work outside the home before they get married, upon marriage they usually quit their jobs, often involuntarily, to be hyonmo yangch'o (a wise mother and good wife). According to one survey conducted in 1985, over 80% of the women who had been employed prior to marriage quit their jobs upon marriage to concentrate on housework and childcare (Kim, 1994:246). Even Korean women with a school-attending child have difficulty working outside because support for their child's education is considered their im- portant job. Indeed, the level of women's success is largely determined by the level of their children's success in education. 305</page><page sequence="6">Table I.

The immigration of Koreans to the United States has led to signifi- cant changes in the traditional Korean family system. The most noteworthy change is probably the radical increase in Korean married women's labor force participation rate. According to the 1990 U.S. census, approximately 60% of Korean American married women participate in the labor force, in comparison to 58% of non-Hispanic white married women (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1993a, Table XLVIII). The census underestimates the labor force participation rate of Korean women because many Korean women who work for family businesses or other Korean businesses do not report their work to the census. In a 1988 survey of Korean married women in New York City, 70% of the 297 respondents participated in the labor force, with 54% work- ing full time. Eighty-seven percent of the respondents reported that they had worked outside the home at one time or another. Although 42% of the re- spondents reported that they worked outside the home in Korea at one time or another, many worked before they married. Only 23% of those respon- dents who were married in Korea, said that they worked after they married. As shown in Table I, nearly half of the Korean working women were self- employed in small businesses. Thirty-eight percent of the women in the labor force worked together with their husbands in the same businesses, another 12% ran their own businesses independently of their husbands, and 36% were employed in co-ethnic businesses. Working in a green grocery, a nail salon, or dry cleaning store-typical Korean businesses in New York-means that Korean working women put in exceptionally long hours. As shown in Table II, Korean married working women in the survey spent 51 h per week Table II.

Those engaged in their own businesses spent 56 h a week in their businesses, only 5 h less than their self-employed husbands. Korean immigrant working women make an important income con- tribution to the family finances, many making a greater contribution than their husbands. When two partners run the same business, the wife is usu- ally in charge of the cash register and the husband takes care of the total management of the store. The wife's control of the cash register is one of the central factors that make Korean retail businesses, such as produce, gro- cery, and liquor retail businesses, successful (Min, 1988:114, 115). A grocery storeowner in Bayside, New York City, told me about how important his wife's help was to the success in the business. I open the store at seven and work with an employee. My wife joins me at nine after sending our two children to school. During the daytime, I often have to go out to buy grocery items on sale from large chain stores. I can go out mainly because she takes care of the cash register. At six, my wife goes back home to prepare dinner and take care of our children while I work with our employees. I don't know how I can operate my grocery store without my wife. Owners of large businesses can run their businesses with employees and arrange for their wives to stay at home to take care of their children. But most Koreans, particularly new immigrants, start with small family businesses where husbands and wives need to coordinate for economic survival. Korean wives play a more important role than their husbands in many family-run businesses, particularly small dry cleaning shops and small restaurants. I was a regular client of a dry cleaning shop that was run by a Korean wife and her husband for several years (the shop was closed 2 years ago). The husband played a marginal role in running the shop; he cleaned sidewalks and received laundry materials, while his wife ironed and altered dresses. The husband, an engineer in Korea, did not enjoy his job at all and was reluctant to talk with customers probably because he felt the job was demeaning. By contrast, his wife who received a high school education seemed to enjoy her job, most of the time smiling and talking with customers. The 1,500 Korean-owned nail salons in the New York area are usually owned and run by women. Some Korean men just drive their wives to and from the nail shop and help them open and close it while they either baby-sit or play golf during the daytime. They are often called "shuttermen" or "househusbands" in the Korean community. As will be shown later, in the Korean community, where the husband's main role is considered to be financial support for the family, this kind of role reversal puts pressure on husbands. Korean immigrant wives can also find jobs in Korean-owned stores more easily than their husbands. Although various managerial jobs available in 307</page><page sequence="8">Korean-owned stores are filled by male immigrants, they are limited in num- ber. There is more of a demand for blue-collar workers. But Korean male immigrants, mostly highly educated,3 are not attracted to blue-collar jobs in the ethnic economy. Korean business owners usually turn to "inexpen- sive, hardworking" Latino male workers for these blue-collar jobs (Min, 1996; Yoon, 1997:213). The large number of sales-related white-collar jobs are usually filled by Korean women. The modal category of Korean immi- grant women's educational levels is high school graduation. As high school graduates, they are not satisfied with working as saleswomen or cashiers in co-ethnic businesses, but they do not consider it demeaning either. Thus, the structure of the Korean ethnic economy has helped Korean wives to play an active economic role. While it usually takes newly arrived Korean immigrant men a few months to find meaningful jobs, their wives often find jobs quickly and become the main breadwinners. The structure of the Korean ethnic economy also gives elderly women advantages over elderly men for making money. Elderly women can find jobs easily as babysitters and housemaids in the Korean community in New York since many dual-working Korean immigrant families with children need these services. Some women offer babysitting services at their own apartments while others get paid to take care of their grandchildren. Elderly women can also find jobs as cashiers in Korean grocery stores and even as cooks in the Korean Senior Center. Some widowed women sublease their apartment bedrooms to Korean college students and cook for them to help pay the rent. By contrast, the major employment sources for elderly men are several Korean senior citizens' centers where they help other elderly peo- ple with paperwork and driving taxicabs. After taking an English language course for 1 year, Byung Kyun Han, 63, found a job working 20 h a week at the Korean American Senior Citizens Society, for $350 a month. His wife, who can barely speak English, however, earns $600 per month by keeping two elementary school children after school. SEGREGATION AND PERSISTENCE OF PATRIARCHY We have noted thus far that the economic structure of the Korean com- munity has enabled Korean immigrant women to increase their economic role significantly. While Korean women's increased economic role provides 3According to the 1990 census (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1993b, Table III), 47% of Korean male immigrants 25 years old and over completed 4 years of college education in comparison to 26% of female immigrants. This suggests that the majority of economically active Korean men are college graduates. 308 Min</page><page sequence="9">Changes in Korean Immigrants an impetus for changing traditional gender role attitudes associated with the Confucian patriarchal system, other structural forces in the Korean commu- nity help to perpetuate the patriarchal ideology. Three structural factors- Korean immigrants' cultural homogeneity, their economic segregation, and their high affiliation with Korean ethnic churches-keep Korean immigrants socially segregated from the larger society. This social segregation, in turn, perpetuates the patriarchal ideology Korean immigrants brought with them from Korea by preventing them from learning the more egalitarian gender role attitudes prevalent in American society. Korean immigrants are a very homogeneous group in culture and histor- ical experiences, more homogeneous than any other Asian group, including the Japanese (Min, 1991). Language probably is the most significant element of culture, and Korean immigrants have a single language. Korean immi- grants, almost all of whom can speak, read, and write the Korean language fluently, depend mainly upon Korean-language ethnic dailies and television and radio programs for news, information, and leisure activities (Hurh and Kim, 1988:83). With advances in technology and communication, Korean im- migrants in New York as well as in most other major Korean communities hear the same-day news broadcasts from Korea via satellite and watch new Korean movies and television programs on videotapes produced in Korea. Although Korean immigrants live physically in the United States, most of the time they speak the Korean language, and practice Korean customs, in- cluding more patriarchal marital relations based on the Confucian gender hierarchy. As presented in Table I, about 85 % of the Korean immigrant workforce in New York City is involved in the ethnic economy either as business own- ers or employees of co-ethnic businesses. This economic segregation gives Korean immigrants advantages over other immigrant groups for maintaining their cultural traditions and social interactions with co-ethnics (Min, 1991). Yet it also hinders their interactions with American citizens. The vast ma- jority of the employees in Korean-owned stores are either Korean or Latino immigrants (Min, 1996:114; Yoon, 1997:213). It is noteworthy that Latino workers hired by Korean stores usually hold a conservative gender role ide- ology similar to that of Korean immigrants. Although Korean-owned busi- nesses usually serve native-born white and African American customers, their communications with customers for the most part are minimal. For these reasons, Korean immigrants, concentrated in the Korean ethnic econ- omy, have little opportunity to learn American customs, including a more egalitarian gender role orientation. The participation of most Korean immigrants in a Korean Christian church also perpetuates the patriarchal ideology. Korean immigrants are 309</page><page sequence="10">heavily drawn from the Christian population; although Christians compose only approximately 25% of the population in South Korea, over 50% of Korean immigrants attended a Protestant or Catholic church prior to im- migration (Hurh and Kim, 1990; Park et al., 1990).4 Many other Korean immigrants who did not attend a Christian church in Korea do participate in a Korean immigrant congregation for fellowship and other practical pur- poses. As a result, approximately 75 % of Korean immigrants participate in a Korean immigrant Protestant or Catholic church (Hurh and Kim, 1990; Min, 2000). Although neither Protestantism nor Catholicism is Koreans' indigenous religion, both religions have incorporated much of Korean culture in their adaptation to Korean society. In their efforts to maintain Korean cultural tra- ditions through their ethnic churches, Korean immigrants have Koreanized Christian religions even further (Min, 1992). The patriarchal ideology based on Confucianism is one of the central elements of Korean culture. The par- ticipation of most Korean immigrants in Korean churches bolsters the patri- archal ideology inherent in both Confucianism and Christianity in two dif- ferent ways. First, the hierarchical structure of Korean immigrant churches reinforces the patriarchal ideology. Korean immigrant churches usually do not allow women to serve as head pastors or to hold important positions, although women compose the majority of church members both in South Korea and in the Korean immigrant community (Min, 1992). In 1997, women served as the main pastors for only four of the approximately 600 Korean immigrant churches in the New York-New Jersey area. In a Korean church, women are usually involved in fundraising, prayer meetings, visiting the sick, and so forth, all activities related to women's traditional roles as nurturers and caretakers. On the other hand, men hold important positions that in- volve decision making in organizational and financial affairs (Kim, 1996:76; Min, 1998). Second, Korean immigrant churches reinforce the patriarchal ideology by teaching women their subordinate position in the family and society. Many Korean women, working women in particular, experience conflicts between the sexist and hierarchical Korean culture and the more egalitar- ian American culture. Most of these women resolve their inner conflicts by accepting the Korean patriarchal ideology. One way they resolve their in- ner conflicts is by appealing to "Christian" religious beliefs to legitimatize Korean culture and women's subordinate status (Kim, 1996:118). Kim in- terviewed many Korean Christian women to examine how they rationalized 4The overrepresentation of Christians in large cities in Korea and the middle-class segment of the Korean population from which Korean immigrants are largely drawn and the selective mi- gration of more Christians to the United States explain why the majority of Korean immigrants were Christians in Korea. 310 Min</page><page sequence="11">Changes in Korean Immigrants male supremacy by accepting sexist anthropomorphic views of God. One of her interviewees said (Kim, 1996:90): I believe men are superior to women. If men and women are equal, there is al- ways collision. Therefore, God made women inferior to men so that He prevents collision.... Gee I had such a hard life after getting married. My husband and I fought so much during our twenty-five year marriage, but I could not win. Oh, I was miserable. Now, I've given up. I realized that to win against a husband is not possible because God made men superior to women. MARITAL CONFLICTS AND DISSOLUTIONS My interviews with Korean immigrants and discussions with Korean family counselors suggest that divorce and separation occur far more fre- quently among Korean immigrants than in the population in Korea. Census data support this. According to the 1990 census (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1993b:14), using the number of divorced persons per 1,000 people 15 years old and over, Korean immigrant men have a divorce rate three times higher than that of men in Korea and Korean immigrant women's divorce rate is five times higher than that of women in Korea. This great sex differential in divorce seems to be mainly the result of an exceptionally high divorce rate of Korean women married to American servicemen.5 Yet the census data show that the Korean immigrant population as a whole has a much higher divorce rate than the population in Korea. Koreans' divorce has increased with immigration partly because exposure to American culture has led many Korean immigrants to accept more liberal views of marriage and divorce. Yet Korean immigrants' gender role reversals and Korean men's status anxiety, too, contribute significantly to their marital instability. Gender Role Reversal and Marital Conflicts In her Gendered Transitions (Hondagneu-Sotelo, 1994:195), Hondagneu- Sotelo pointed out that Mexican immigrant women achieved more egali- tarian marital relations not because they were influenced by the feminist ideology but because their contribution to the family economy increased their bargaining power. As previously noted, Korean immigrant women live in the sociocultural milieu that perpetuates the Confucian patriarchal ide- ology. However, the increase in their economic role inevitably increases their voices at home. At Korean churches and other community settings, 5Although there is no hard data on the divorce rate of Korean"military brides," two social workers familiar with these women told me that the majority of their marriages end with divorce. 311</page><page sequence="12">they are forced to conform to patriarchal norms. Yet at least at home many Korean immigrant women who are economically active try to challenge their husbands' authority and the unequal division of housework (Lim, 1997). But their husbands, who have been immersed into the Confucian patriar- chal ideology, are not ready to give up their culturally prescribed authority and undertake housework chores. This situation creates tensions in marital relations. Marital conflicts that Mr. and Mrs. Kim experience typify conflicts that many other Korean immigrant couples experience. Yong Ja Kim, a 41-year-old Korean woman, worked at her retail store with her husband from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., six days a week. When they came back home around 8 p.m., she usually prepared dinner while her husband read a Korean daily and watched Korean television programs. Recently she argued a lot with her husband over his not helping with dishwashing and housecleaning. She recounted her complaint to her husband: I work in the store as many hours as you do, and I play an even more important role in our business than you. But you don't help me at home. It's never fair. My friends in Korea work full-time at home, but don't have to work outside. Here I work too much both inside and outside the home. Did you bring me to this country for exploitation? Chun Ho Kim (her husband) could not understand how much and how fast his wife had changed her attitudes toward him since they had come to the United States. He did not remember her talking back to him in Korea. When I told him about his wife's complaint that he was not helping her with housework at all, he responded: It makes no sense for her to accuse me of not helping her at home at all. In addition to house maintenance, I took care of garbage disposal more often than she and helped her with grocery shopping very often. I did neither of the chores in Korea. Chun Ho Kim agreed that he rarely did dishwashing and housecleaning. But he said that the image of the husband washing dishes in the kitchen is far from the ideal family pattern he dreamed of in Korea. Dong Sik Kim, a middle-aged Korean man who ran a dry cleaning shop in Manhattan with his wife, responded in a similar manner when I asked him whether he believed he should assume more housework responsibility: But how can we, men, change our custom (not working in the kitchen) so quickly and maintain equal relations with them [wives]? Further, if marital relations are equal, we will have lots of conflicts. See, American families! They are more equal, women are more aggressive, but that's why they have lots of conflicts and divorces. There is no order in them. We earlier noted that some Korean immigrant women play the pri- mary provider role while their husbands are chronically unemployed. As 312 Min</page><page sequence="13">Changes in Korean Immigrants documented effectively by Rubin (1983), gender role reversal often causes family violence and divorce even in native American families because it can destroy the husband's self-esteem easily. Role reversal can create more seri- ous problems in Korean immigrant families than in native American families because Korean husbands have more difficulties accepting their economic incompetence and their wives' increased voices. Consider one example of the way in which gender role reversal led to marital conflict and ultimately divorce. When Kyung Ja Choi married Mr. Lee in Korea, she did not know him well; her mother arranged the match mainly because Mr. Lee was well- educated, with a master's degree in linguistics. Upon immigration to the United States, Choi became the main breadwinner by changing several odd jobs while her husband was, for most part, unemployed. Mr. Lee's unem- ployment was prolonged because as a highly educated man he was unwilling to take the kind of blue-collar job that was available in a Korean business. He tried setting up a few semiprofessional businesses, such as real estate and insurance, but these failed. Choi had difficulty understanding her husband's "economic incompetence." When she argued with him, she often screamed, "Why won't you find a blue-collar job in a Korean produce store?" She also pressured him to take more responsibility for housework. This situation eroded the husband's patriarchal authority, which led him to react violently to his wife. When they argued, he often used physical force. When his punch caused a broken nose, she called the police and pushed him out of the house. She is now legally divorced. I know of several similar cases where the husband's economic incom- petence and role reversal led to marital conflicts, violence, and ultimately divorce. The men were usually highly educated and therefore unwilling to take blue-collar jobs, but they were not business-oriented and so were unsuc- cessful in running a business themselves. Meanwhile, their wives had stable jobs, many as nurses. Because women's economic role increases their bargaining power and marital conflicts, many Korean immigrant men do not want their wives to work full time outside the home.6 But most Korean men in New York al- low or even expect their wives to participate in the labor force because they cannot support their families by themselves. They feel very frustrated over their inability to support independently. They feel frustrated particu- larly because they know that most of their friends in Korea do not depend upon their wives for any portion of the family income. Partly because of fre- quent marital conflicts in dual-worker families, even some Korean women 6Korean immigrant husbands also do not want their wives to work outside the home for their children's education. 313</page><page sequence="14">consider the wife's labor force participation undesirable. As one woman described I deliberately decided not to work outside the home, although it is not easy to stay at home as a full-time housewife. I saw many Korean dual-worker couples having marital conflicts. When women make money they become aggressive and argue with their husbands. In order to maintain order in the family, we need to maintain the gender division of labor and the patriarchal system. This is why I decided not to work. Status Anxiety and Marital Complications Most Korean immigrant men held high-level white-collar and profes- sional occupations in Korea. But they experience significant downward mobility in their occupational status in the United States (Min, 1984). Korean men find it difficult to cope with the loss in occupational status they expe- rience in this country. In the face of downward occupational mobility, they seek to assert their authority in the home, but increasingly they feel that their wives and children no longer accept it without question. Often their frustration over low status becomes serious when they reach middle age, leading to a midlife crisis. Korean middle-aged men's status anxiety often strains their marital relations. Young Soo Lee, who worked as a manager for a major bank branch in Korea, immigrated to this country in the late 1970s to achieve his "American dream." In his early fifties now, he has been running his delicatessen for 10 years. His wife said, He has often expressed his bitterness about his position as a small storeowner. And his frustration over his low status greatly influences our relations. Five years ago, he left home after a little argument with me and came back two weeks later. He wanted to get respect from me. But a real source of the problem was not me, but his frustration over low status. Some Korean women, too, go through a midlife crisis derived from status anxiety, complicating their marital relations. Women may feel that they have spent too much time caring for their families-and not enough on their own careers. Husbands may resist their wives' new career goals and independence. I interviewed He Ran Park, a Korean woman in her late forties. She had four children under 18 but had just begun a college degree program. Before immigration, He Ran taught for 8 years in an elementary school in Korea,7 including 2 years after marriage. She spent all her years in this country helping her husband with his business and caring for her four 7At that time people with 2 years of college education were certified to teach in an elementary school in Korea. 314 Min</page><page sequence="15">Changes in Korean Immigrants children. She commented I decided to start a college degree program at this stage of life to save myself, to save my career. For so many years I had been preoccupied with child care and family survival. But suddenly I realized that I had lost too much of myself. Of course, my study complicates my family life and marital relations. But I am now so determined that my husband cannot stop me. She said that the Korean custom that stresses a mother's sacrifice for her children's education victimizes so many women. She emphasized that her career is as important as her children's education. One way Korean men compensate for the low status associated with their occupations is to seek status in the Korean community by joining var- ious ethnic organizations. There is strong competition and intense struggle for high-status positions (gamtu ssaum) as ethnic organizations can provide only a limited number of such positions. Many successful businessmen spend large amounts of money ("face-saving money") to secure positions in large ethnic organizations, including churches. Many Korean women resist their husbands' excessive donations and frequent social meetings to get gamtu (a high position) in the Korean community. In one extreme case, a husband spent so much money and time on his election campaigns that he neglected his grocery business and children. To get his friends' strong support for his election campaign, he organized several golf trips and used credit cards to pay for the trips. His waste of the income from the family business led his wife to go back to Korea for separation. Status anxiety and frustration can lead Korean immigrant men to turn to excessive drinking, golfing, and gambling, which, needless to say, con- tribute to marital difficulties. Soon Hi Kwon, a woman in her mid-forties, commented on her husband's drinking problem: When our discount store did well, my husband began to drink in Korean clubs reg- ularly. Each night, he paid over $300 for a bottle of liquor and around $100 to the girls as tips. Sometimes, he drank until early morning and came back directly to the store. After sleeping in the store, he left for the club early evening with money from the cash register. Another woman described her husband's "habitual drinking" as the most serious problem in their marital relations: Two or three times a month he is involved in heavy drinking. Two weeks ago, the police called me from a Korean club. Because he did not want to leave the club when they were closing it, they called the police. At 3:00 in the morning, I tried to pick him up from the club, but he resisted. Two police officers helped me to put him into the car. He closed his business on the day. Korean immigrant men's heavy drinking is partly cultural. In New York, as well as in Korea, many Korean men often go ich'a (going to another 315</page><page sequence="16">place for drinking in the same night) and samch'a (going to a third place for drinking in the same night) partly because it is an accepted custom, at least among men. But Korean immigrants' boredom and status anxiety related to their monotonous lives in labor-intensive small businesses also contribute to heavy drinking. They are looking for an outlet for their stress and the monotony of their lives and want to get respect from women in Korean clubs. Hang Ja Kim, the former director of a Korean family counseling center, observed: "With $400 in a Korean club, each of them is treated like a king by young Korean girls. For at least two or three hours, they can release all their tensions and stress. With their blue-collar jobs, nowhere can they get that kind of treatment." Long Hours of Working Together and Marital Conflicts The husband and the wife working in a family store for long hours can be another source of Korean immigrants' frequent marital conflicts. Many Koreans who run family businesses spend almost 24 h a day with their spouses, usually in a very stressful environment. It is easy for them to argue over business matters. Since there is no clear demarcation between family and work life, tensions in one area can spill over and exacerbate tensions in the other area. The fact that two partners working together in the family store creates marital conflicts is well known to Korean immigrants (see Lim, 1997:39). One of my male interviewees in his sixties said: If I had been engaged in a business with my wife from the beginning, I would have made a lot of money. But learning that many of my self-employed friends were experiencing marital conflicts, I have tried to work separately from my wife. Working with their spouses in a family business for long hours is more stressful to women than to men because Korean husbands can continue to exercise their patriarchal authority in the store. A few Korean women complained that their husbands try to restrict their freedom in the store as well as at home. He Soon Kim, a Korean woman in her late forties, has run a dry cleaning business with her husband for 10 years. She commented, Staying together all day has increased our chance for arguments and conflicts. My husband, whether at home or in the store, always tries to exercise his patriarchal authority over me. Meeting him in the evening at home would give him enough chance to restrict my freedom. Staying together all day, he does not give me any breathing room. I wish he, like other professional men, could take business trips often. Korean women like professional husbands because they often stay away from home for a business trip. In Korea, many women complain that their husbands take a business trip too often, spending little time with them at home. Ironically, many Korean 316 Min</page><page sequence="17">Changes in Korean Immigrants immigrant women wish that their husbands took a business trip so that they can have freedom. CONCLUSION It is an important theoretical perspective that the increase in the wife's hours of paid work and/or earnings in general and the discrepancy be- tween gender role behavior and attitudes in particular cause marital conflicts and instability. This paper has examined Korean immigrants' marital rela- tions, using the same theoretical perspective. The foregoing analysis shows that Korean immigrant wives' increased economic role and their husbands' decreased economic power and social status have significantly increased their marital conflicts and instability. In fact, Korean immigrants provide a salient case for testing the hypothesis deriving from the theoretical perspec- tive regarding the positive effects of role reversal on marital conflicts and instability. Korean immigrants may experience a higher level of marital conflicts than other immigrant groups because there is a greater discrepancy between their gender role behavior and traditional gender role attitudes. Yet, as cited in the Introduction, other contemporary immigrant groups in the United States, mostly originated from Third World countries, encounter similar mar- ital problems caused by a phenomenal increase in women's economic role and role reversals. The influx of family-sponsored immigrants since the lib- eralization of the immigration law in 1965 has led to a dramatic increase in the number of immigrant families. In 1990, the households headed by immigrants composed 9% of all households in the United States. As of 2000, they may compose well over 10%. As a result, social scientists are beginning to pay more and more attention to immigrant families. A key factor that has significant effects on marital relations in most immigrant families is the increase in the immigrant woman's economic role. This factor was much less important for understanding white immigrant families at the turn of the twentieth century because at that time whether in Europe or in the United States women usually did not work outside the home (Foner, 1999). The adjustment of Third World, contemporary immigrants to American society involves both assimilation and multiculturalism (Alba, 1999). The radical increase in contemporary immigrant women's economic role, com- parable to white American women, reflects their assimilation to American society. However, Korean and other immigrants' marital relations are largely regulated by traditional patriarchal customs based on Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, or other patriarchal ideology transplanted from their home 317</page><page sequence="18">countries. Their practice of traditional patriarchal customs has greatly con- tributed to cultural diversity in American society. Significant for this paper, the radical increase in contemporary immigrant women's economic role without altering their husbands' traditional patriarchal ideology has created conflicts and tensions in their marital relations.
