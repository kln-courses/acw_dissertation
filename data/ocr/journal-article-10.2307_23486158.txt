Barro The new classical approach to macro economics has been the most important theoretical advance since the Keynesian revolution of the 1930s. These chapters by prominent figures of the new classical macroeconomics surveys the major contri butions of the 'second generation' of pro ponents of this approach, emphasizing real business cycle theories and applying them to a variety of phenomena. $35.00 cloth ORGANIZATIONAL ECOLOGY Michael T. Hannan and lohn Freeman Hannan and Freeman examine the ecology of organizations by exploring competition for resources and trying to account for rates of entry and exit and for the diversity of organi zational forms. By showing that the destinies of organizations are determined more by impersonal forces than by the intervention of individuals, the authors take issue with the anthropomorphic view of organizations as exemplified by most management books. $29.50 cloth THE HISTORY OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED STATES TO 1914 Mira Wilkins This new book by Mira Wilkins provides the first complete history of foreign invest ment in the United States from the colonial era to 1914. It shows why the United States was attractive to foreign investors and traces the changing role of foreign capital in the nation's development, covering both port folio and direct investment. The immense new wave of foreign investment in the United States today, and our status as the world's largest debtor nation-makes this strong exposition far more than just historically interesting.
