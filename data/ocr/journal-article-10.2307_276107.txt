UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA Tucson, Ariz. April, 1954 JADE AND STRING SAWING IN NORTHEASTERN COSTA RICA S. K. LOTHROP COSTA RICAN jade ornaments have been known chiefly through collections made by Padre Jose Maria Valasco in the Nicoya penin- sula, which forms the northwestern corner of the country, and through the subsequent pub- lication of these specimens by C. V. Hartman (1907). The Velasco jade is now in the Museo Nacional at San Jose and the Carnegie Museum of Pittsburgh. The term jade is loosely used by archae- ologists. Hartman employed it to describe 3 minerals: a blue-green jadeite, saussurite, which in Costa Rica usually is blue-green with white spots, and a dark green bowenite. These shades are characteristic of Nicoya specimens but not of the jades of northern Central America and Mexico. More recently, W. F. Foshag has identified the principal minerals used for orna- ments in Costa Rica as diopside-jadeite and chalcedony (Anonymous 1947, Specimens 1-7, 15-18). Hartman wrote (1907: 85), correctly for his time, "On the whole mainland of Costa Rica objects of jade are very rare. In all my excava- tions on the highlands I only came across a few small beads of this mineral. But some fine specimens of jade amulets have been found sporadically in graves on the slopes of Irazu [volcano], and even on the Atlantic coast at Mercedes, and one or two other places. All these finds, however, have been of Nicoyan origin." In addition to the Nicoyan jades, it can now be stated that a second center of aboriginal jade manufacture existed in Costa Rica. In recent years, many jade carvings have been brought to light in the vicinity of the town of Guapiles in northeastern Costa Rica. This area produced its own styles and technics, which we propose to discuss, as well as their relationship to other regions. I am indebted to Carlos Balser of San Jose who has recently published on Costa Rican jades (1953) and has kindly sent me photographs for my illustrations. The town of Guapiles is on the Atlantic coastal plain northeast of Turrialba volcano. It marks the end of the linea vieja, an un- finished railroad line which passes the well- known Las Mercedes archaeological site. The distance between the two is only about 10 miles but the archaeological remains are radically different, for Guapiles was a trading center which both imported and copied pottery, gold, and jade of foreign styles from as far away as Honduras and Panama. Although Mercedes is close to Guapiles and has been ransacked for the last 70 years, only 2 examples of Guapiles jade are on record as being found there (Skinner 1920), apart from the vague statement of Hartman already quoted. Guapiles jades are of many forms but may be divided into groups on the basis of shape, stylistic affiliations, or technic of manufacture. We shall discuss first the types which show the 43 LOTHROP ]</page><page sequence="2">'uo!aII?0o3 J*sleu '01/6 '*IE3S ?IU!T -So03 'ssallduen jo 0uAll!uA 'sluepuad apet '61 'oIY</page><page sequence="3">C6 6 .2 o U Cu ou 4) o0 - F9 tct e o ON li) U) *e CI Cu , 4), Cu ' * ' U g) *Cu</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY influence of other areas, then the local styles, and lastly the local technic. Group 1. Types Related Both to Nicoya and Northern Honduras. Hartman (1907) illus- trates nearly 300 ornaments of stone from Nicoya, most of which could probably be classed as jade. About a third of these are various types of "ax gods" such as are seen in Figure 19, n-p. This name was applied to these specimens on the theory that, when a finished celt proved to be of very fine stone, it was sawed in half, drilled for suspension as a pendant, and the outer surface was carved to represent a god. It is indeed true that the backs of many pieces show the marks of sawing. It is also true that complete celts of jadeite or chalcedony have rarely been found in Costa Rica, nor is there any record of a partly divided celt. On the other hand, jadeite boulders il- lustrated by Hartman (1907, P1. 32, 1-4) reveal cuttings which correspond to the backs of ax gods in size, shape, and technic. By far the greatest number of ax gods has been found in the Nicoya peninsula, where the greatest diversity of forms also occurs. They are not uncommon in the Guapiles region where they constitute about 7 percent of the jade carvings as compared with over 30 percent in Nicoya. Simplified and smaller ax gods also are found on the north coast of Honduras, especially in the vicinity of the Guaymoretta Lagoon (Stone 1941: 52; Strong 1948: 81-3). Another type of jade artifact with a similar distribution consists of large tubular jade beads (Fig. 21). In the Guapiles region they are about an inch thick and up to 14 inches or more in length. The Honduranean examples are fatter and a little shorter. The Nicoyan specimens also are smaller. In a private collection we have seen pieces fully as big as those from Guapiles, said to have been found on the Rio Frio on the north slope of the volcanoes above Lake Nicaragua. These beads were drilled from both ends with such skill that the 2 holes meet almost exactly. The geographical distribution of these jades seems peculiar, but other types of artifacts also link these distant areas. We may mention related pottery and figurine types found in northern Honduras and northeastern Costa Rica (Lothrop 1926: 374). Also similar pot- tery, figurines, and metates are recorded in northern Honduras and northwestern Costa Rica (Spinden 1925; Lothrop 1926: 168-9, 273- 5). The cultural connections between these areas are in fact stronger than the publications cited would indicate, for there is much still un- published evidence. The only serious attempt to explain this distribution (Spinden 1925) was the suggestion that a predominantly Choro- tegan culture once extended from the south- eastern Maya frontier to the borders of Panama. In recent years, however, local cultures such as Cocle and Veraguas have been distinguished in Panama, and it has been possible to show that their products, especially gold jewelry, were traded by land and by sea as far north as Yucatan and central Mexico. These known journeyings may better account for the ap- pearance of Costa Rican styles in Honduras and vice versa than the concept of a common cul- tural tradition, which, however, is not entirely ruled out. Group 2. Types Related to Isthmian Gold Jewelry. Another class of Guapiles jades, il- lustrated in Figure 19 a-d, g, is grouped together because they repeat in stone well-known Pana- manian styles of cast metal ornaments. The birds (b, g) are of the type called "eagles," the commonest form of cast pendant in the Prov- ince of Veraguas, which was traded to the north as far as Yucatan. The frog (a) also is a common Veraguas shape (Lothrop 1950, Figs. 71-9, 96-8, 138). The animal with a curling tail (c, d), which has been identified as a cebus monkey, is characteristic of Cocle but several gold examples have been unearthed near Guapiles (Lothrop 1937, Figs. 169-73; 1950, Fig. 141; 1952, Fig. 108). The bird with a long beak (f) also occurs in Cocle but in stone rather than gold. The Guapiles jade frogs and monkeys are types also recorded from the Nicoya peninsula (Hartman 1907, Pls. 40, 1-10 13-6; 41, 11-4, 19, 20, 23). The Nicoya examples, however, tend to be less vigorously rendered. The people of Guapiles evidently maintained direct trade con- tacts with Cocle and Veraguas, but they made local copies of foreign forms which pleased them. This confirms a statement made to Columbus in 1502 (1744: 585) by the natives of Cariay, now Port Lim6n, that they traded along the coast of Panama as far as a town named Cubigua. This is located by Morison (1942 Vol. 2: 353, 360) between the Belen and Cocle del Norte rivers. Nicoyan contacts with Panama seem to have been principally with the Province of Chiriqui 46 [ XXI, 1, 1955</page><page sequence="5">JADE AND STRING SAWING IN COSTA RICA as attested by the large number of Chiriqui figurines and whistles found in Nicoya and by stylistic influence noted on local pottery. As recently as 1882, a party of Indians from Chiriqui travelled to Nicoya to fish for pearls (Bransford 1884: 823). Group 3. Types Related to Panama and the Caribbean. "Winged" pendants are a type of ornament found in Costa Rica, Panama, north- ern Colombia and Venezuela, and in the West Indies as far north as Puerto Rico (Lothrop 1937: 163). The usual form is a flattened, elongated oval which was suspended hori- zontally. The material may be jade, agate, or other stones, or shell. Occasionally the body and head of a bat were carved in the center, and the whole, either with or without the carving, evidently symbolizes a bat with ex- tended wings. Figure 20 a, illustrates an ex- ample found near Guapiles, which is perhaps the most complex yet recorded. The head with pointed ears and the short legs are typical. The wings, however, are elaborately carved to repre- sent crocodile heads in profile. Hartman has published an almost equally intricate jade example from Nicoya as well as simpler speci- mens which make possible the bat identifica- tion (1907, Pls. 41, 3, 6, 7; 44, 6, 7). Group 4. Types Related to Peru. The Guapiles jades still to be described are particu- larly characteristic of the area, for they have been manufactured at least in part by string sawing, a technic to be discussed presently. A group which cannot be very exactly defined consists of human or anthropomorphic figures shown in profile. The head may be angular and often there are projections on top of it (Fig. 19 k). In some cases, the figure carries a staff or a serpent in front of the body (Fig. 20 e-g). These features and the position of the body give an impression of remote coastal Tia- huanaco influence from Peru, more clearly dis- cernible in stone carvings from the Diquis delta in southwestern Costa Rica. The expansion of Tiahuanaco art motifs from a small district in southern Peru far to the north and south is a phenomenon which ar- chaeologists have traced in some detail but have not yet satisfactorily explained. Blend- ing with local styles and degeneration of the original Tiahuanaco forms to the point where they can scarcely be recognized have both been noted. Curiously enough the closest parallels to the Guapiles jade figures occur on the south- ern margin of Tiahuanaco influence in Chile, where small wooden figures of comparable shape were cut in part by the string technic (Bennett 1954, Fig. 114, right). Group 5. Presumably Local Types. We have eliminated, so far as was possible, all Guapiles jades which show any outside influence in their form. The remainder, at least at present, may be regarded as types which developed locally. One of these, illustrated in Figure 19 m, is a square-mouthed, broad-nosed, anthropomor- phic figure shown full face. Two small animal heads in profile form a headdress. There are also small animal heads flanking the hips and knees, recalling gold anthropomorphic pendants from Veraguas (Lothrop 1950, Figs. 110-6). This piece as a whole, however, does not belong with any standard group of Veraguas gold. One of the jade specimens found at Las Mercedes by Skinner (1920, P1. 1) evidently is of the same type. Figure 20 h, shows a weird female figure surrounded by a stirrup-shaped frame, all cut from one piece of jade. The head consists of a horizontal rectangular block with no other features than 2 eyes. It is surmounted as usual by 2 small animal heads in profile. These heads and the frame evidently have some symbolic significance by themselves. A specimen in the Balser collection portrays a similarly shaped frame and heads with no enclosed figure, and there is another piece of this form in the Bliss collection. A specimen published by Skinner (1920, P1. 2) perhaps belongs in this group. Animal figures of various types are found near Guapiles, of which the most definite is a monkey which can be recognized by its tail (Fig. 19 e, h, i). Birds are shown in profile (Figs. 19 1; 20 b, d), all marked by exaggerated beaks, which in 2 cases have become spirals. A realistically curled snake appears in Figure 20 c. One feature shared by all these pieces is that their forms, simple or complex, could only be created by string sawing. Jade-working Technics. Very little is known about aboriginal methods of stone working in Middle America beyond what can be learned by inspection. This seems to be true of other areas, with the result that far more has been published on easily seen flaking than on abra- sive technics. Sahagun's description of Mexican jewelers (Seler 1892: 418-20) is unduly vague, and it applies to the final shaping and polish- ing. He wrote of grinding one stone against 47 LOTHROP ]</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY another, scraping (or incising?) tools of flint or bronze, the use of sand or emery as abrasives, and a final polishing with hard wood such as bamboo. Saws may be of 2 kinds. If the saw is harder than the material to be cut, it operates by direct abrasion. If the material to be cut is the harder, then an abrasive agent such as sharp sand must be employed and the saw itself replaced when it wears out. Flat saws for slicing jade pre- sumably were thin slabs of very hard wood. The slots of unfinished cuts in jade may be as narrow as 0.2 cm. (Lothrop 1936, Fig. 66 i). If a broad slab was to be cut, usually it was attacked from opposite directions and worked until the central uncut wall was so thin that it could be broken. This left a characteristic rough ridge both on the freed section and main mass. Although it has been suggested that the Nicoya ax gods had been cut with string (Brown 1898: 145), we believe that the speci- mens themselves and the cores published by Hartman (1907, P1. 32, 3) definitely indicate a flat-bladed saw. String sawing, as its name implies, consists of coating string with an abrasive and rubbing it back and forth across the place to be cut. It seems a method better suited to softer material than jade, the cutting of which must have con- sumed a vast amount of fiber. It had certain advantages over other methods, however, as appears from the following: 1. With a flat saw, all initial cuts must start on an exterior surface. With a string saw, a small hole may be drilled and the cutting started anywhere (Fig. 19 m). 2. By string sawing it is possible to cut curved interior lines which could not be made with a flat saw (Fig. 20 b-d). 3. Conversely, as is the case with a narrow jigsaw, it is not easy to cut straight lines. Note the wobbly interior of the frame in Figure 20 h. 4. It is characteristic of sawing away from a drilled hole that the cut is narrower than the hole (Figs. 19 m; 20 g), because the string, when pulled tight, becomes narrower. 5. To obtain enough pressure, the string must be bent across the surface to be cut. The end of the cut, therefore, will not be flat but rounded. Identification of string sawing in Guapiles jades was based primarily on visual examina- tion in the light of the characteristics here noted, but it is supported by eye-witness state- ments that string sawing was practiced in Panama in the early 16th century. Ferdinand Columbus wrote of the natives of Veraguas (1744: 590), "Their food is fish, which they take with nets and hooks made of tortoise-shell, which they cut with a thread, as if they were sawing; the same they use in the [West Indian] islands." Las Casas (Lib. 2, Cap. 26) confirms this statement and adds that they could cut iron by this method of sawing. Apart from the Guapiles region, cutting jade with a string is of great rarity but considerable antiquity. We have already mentioned 2 speci- mens found by Skinner (1920) at the nearby Las Mercedes site. Hartman (1907, Pls. 35, 14; 39, 31, 33) illustrates only one certain and 2 possible examples from Nicoya. The most ancient jade object now known which has been cut by string is a large Olmec figurine in the museum at Puebla, Mexico (Covarrubias 1946, Lam. I). It is of the standing type. Arms and hands have been freed from the body by drill- ing holes in the armpits and by cutting down- ward with string. This apparently was not a common Olmec practice. An Olmec jade, however, has been found in Costa Rica (Covar- rubias 1946, Fig. 18) and the sawing technic there may have been derived from that source. In the Guatemalan highlands at Kaminaljuyu, 2 pieces of Mayan jade cut by string sawing date from the Esperanza (Early Classic) phase (Kid- der, Jennings, and Shook 1946, Figs. 148 f; 149 h). The same authors (p. 121) refer to a simi- larly cut jade from Ococingo published by Spin- den (1913, Fig. 95). Finally, there is a Late Classic Mayan example which was discovered at Nebaj (Smith and Kidder 1951, Fig. 52 f). Three other specimens from the Cenote of Sacrifice at Chichen Itza in the Peabody Mu- seum of Harvard probably are of equivalent date. It is not our purpose to examine exhaustively the New World distribution of string sawing. In prehistoric times, no doubt it was employed most frequently on softer materials than jade, which often have perished in the ground, and, after the introduction of iron, this technic was abandoned in favor of less laborious methods. We may point out, however, that owing to the unusually arid climate found on the coasts of Peru and northern Chile, many artifacts of bone and wood have been preserved, some of which appear to have been shaped in part by [ XXI, 1, 1955 48</page><page sequence="7">JADE AND STRING SAWING IN COSTA RICA the string-cutting technic. Sawing with a leather thong and sand was practiced in regions which did not produce proper vegetal fiber to make string. Another characteristic of Guapiles jades is that there is a lot of fine detail which may be incised or in relief (Fig. 19 m, n). How this was done and with what tools we cannot be certain. The suggestion has been made that the spines of cactus or tropical vines plus a very fine abrasive might have been employed for such delicate workmanship. How the long tubular beads were drilled we cannot say. The holes taper slightly from the ends to their meeting point. Obviously a strong drill was needed as there must have been stress from torsion. Two specimens in the Peabody Museum of Harvard are 13 and 14 inches long and about an inch in diameter (Fig. 21). The openings of all holes are 5/16 inch in diameter, tapering to about 3/16 in the center. The larger bar was drilled 8 inches from one end and 6 from the other. This is the deepest drilling of jade yet recorded in the New World. The Maya in the Classical period wore tub- ular or rectangular beads of jade as bar pend- ants, which they drilled from both ends with more taper than appears in Costa Rican exam- ples. The largest Maya specimen we have seen, from the Cenote of Sacrifice at Chichen Itza, is about 7 inches long or half the size of typical Guapiles bars. The discovery of a large jade boulder during excavations at Kaminaljuyui, Guatemala (Kidder, Jennings, and Shook 1946, Fig. 154 c, d), indicates that the Maya possessed the raw material to cut beads equal in size to those of Honduras and Costa Rica. That they failed to do so may have been the result of inability to drill them. -hI.- iIII IN 1.1 i,.f. Discussion. An unusual feature of Guapiles jades is that in some anthropomorphic speci- mens the legs have been separated and the arms have been freed from the body (Figs. 19 m; 20 h). Most aboriginal American stone sculpture is in bas relief and no attempt was made to liberate the limbs from the block. The only jade carvers, apart from those of Guapiles, even to attempt to free the limbs were the Olmec of eastern Mexico, who did it habitually and successfully. This Olmec trait persisted in the sculpture of central and eastern Mexico among later cultures, including Teotihuacan, Huastec, and Aztec, but in softer stone than jade. Carving of arms and legs in the round also occurs in the central and southeastern United States. Stone statues are uncommon but there are many carved stone effigy pipes. The Maya very seldom made statues in the round, in spite of their ability to handle large blocks of stone and to carve in high relief. The remarkable architectural sculptures seen at Copan are almost completely in the round but they in fact are mosaics with separate arms, legs, torsos, and heads attached to walls by projecting tenons. The roof combs of Maya buildings often were adorned with realistic sculpture (Tozzer 1941, Figs. 22, 31). In Costa Rica, apart from jade there are 3 major styles of stone carving. One is centered in southwestern Nicaragua with examples oc- curring across the border in Nicoya. Very occa- sionally the arms are cut partly free (Bovalius 1886, Pls. 4, 15, 18, 19; Squier 1852: 52). In northeastern Costa Rica, many stone statues have been found, notably at Las Mercedes (Mason 1945). Characteristically the arms and legs are carved in the round. In the Diquis delta in the southwest another style occurs which often has the arms and legs separated i .1 ' 7I Ir- ?, i 1.-.A i. : .-; FIG. 21. Calcined jade beads. Vicinity of Guapiles, Costa Rica.

Finally, in the Province of Chiriqui in Panama, a few statues with freed limbs have been dis- covered (MacCurdy 1911, Fig. 40). In South America there are several centers where carving of statues in the round is charac- teristic. We may mention San Agustin in Co- lombia, Chavin de Huaintar and the Callejon de Huaylas in Peru, and Tiahuanaco in Bolivia. In every case, realism has been sacrificed to symbolism and the carving has been confined to bas relief details. The natives of Middle America apparently did not mine jade except in Honduras and their principal source of supply was waterworn boulders which they picked up in stream beds. In Maya workmanship, except in the case of large pieces which had to be cut up, the orig- inal shape of the stone was modified as little as possible in producing an ornament. In many cases, the backs of manufactured objects still retain the patina produced in the stream. It is characteristic of Costa Rican, Mixtec, and 01- mec jades, however, that they have been so cut down that no trace of the original surface remains. We can say little about origins of the Costa Rican jade industry or of Costa Rican archaeo- logical remains in general. The megalithic stat- ues of Nicoya and Nicaragua are probably not of great age and their stylistic affiliations appear to be chiefly with South America (Richardson 1940: 408-9; Kidder II 1940: 452). The poly- chrome pottery shared by the Guapiles and Nicoya regions admittedly was inspired in part from the north in its shapes, color technics, and designs. By association in the ground, how- ever, it cannot be dated earlier than the well- known Plumbate ware, which is placed as pre- Aztec but mostly following Classical Maya. The few in situ associations indicate a full de- velopment of the Costa Rican polychrome style. The quality of Costa Rican jade rules out all possibility of importation from the north but the local sources may have been discovered long ago. The fact that Olmec (Lines 1942: 222) and Classical Maya jades (Hartman, 1907, P1. 45, 10) have been found in Nicoya implies but does not prove an early knowledge of jade. During the latter part of the Classical Maya period, frequent use of the tubular drill in working jade caused stylistic changes in north- ern Middle America. This tool, held vertically or diagonally, can cut either a circle or an arc. Tubular drilling was commonly employed in Nicoya in the manufacture of stone club-heads but very rarely for shaping jades. It has not yet been detected in the Guapiles area. The inference is that what technics, if any, the Costa Rican jade workers owed to the north were older than use of the tubular drill for carving jade.
