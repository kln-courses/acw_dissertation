<plain_text><page sequence="1">William Stafford. The Way It Is: New and Selected Poems. St. Paul, Mn. Graywolf. 1998. xx + 268 pages. $24.95. ISBN 1-55597-269-1. William Stafford, who died at age seventy-nine in 1993, left behind an impressive body of work that in- cluded sixty-seven volumes of poetry, a staggering amount for any editor to tackle. The editorial team for The Way It Is, faced with the knowledge that their edition would rep- resent Stafford's last published poems, decided to include earlier work in order to contextualize the later verse and to give some idea of Stafford's life work, if one's "life work" can ever be characterized without facile reductions or oversimplifications. In the case of The Way It Is, the questions of how the collection came about, who decided what to include, why decisions were made, and what agendas were being served become impossible to overlook. The editorial team con- sisted of Stafford's son Kim Stafford and the poets Naomi Shihab Nye and Robert Bly, who organized the work in re- verse chronological order. The first part of the book con- sists of Stafford's last poems, from Sometimes I Breathe (1992) and There's a Thread I Follow (poems written in 1993). In addition, the collection includes a reproduction of Stafford's final manuscript, a paper containing a hand- written poem. In addition, there are groupings of selec- tions from earlier books. The first of these is titled "Sto- ries That Could Be True," all published in the sixties or seventies. The poems have been successfully selected, because they clearly demonstrate Stafford's precise, sensitive, and always personal vision. The worlds he creates are private paradises where perception resolves the tension between the wild and the tamed. "One Home" illustrates this: "Mine was a Midwest home - you can keep your world. / Plain black hats rode the thoughts that made our code. / We sang hymns in the house; the roof was near God." Stafford's dialect creates an impenetrable conflict be- tween interior and exterior worlds, with the interior one always surging forth as the only one possible for survival. The second grouping, "Why the Sun Comes Up," con- sists of selections from Smoke's Way (1983), My Name Is William Tell (1992), Even in Quiet Places (1996), and other volumes (1980-93). These show Stafford's remarkable consistency even as his work becomes more based on na- ture and that nature becomes the access point for the workings of the psyche. In "Over the Mountains" this technique is clear: "The world we all came from reaches out; its trees / embrace; its rocks come down ready to cover / us again. Moss clings to the feet and climbs / care- fully, protecting its own. It wants us back." Stafford's intimate vision is brought to the forefront in the third grouping, "How These Words Happened." In "Keeping a Journal" the poet's task is to downscale the vi- sion so that it is a universal expressed through the most minute and revealing details: "At night it was easy for me with my candle / to sit late recording what happened that day. Sometimes / rain breathing in from the dark would begin softly / across the roof and then drum wildly for at- tention." The anthropomorphic gaze is humanely affirm- ing, and Stafford manages the balance between the exis- tentially challenging and the sentimental very well. Perhaps the most disturbing work of the collection is the poem written on the poet's last morning, "'Are You Mr. William Stafford?'": 'You can't tell when strange things with meaning / will happen. I'm [still] here writing it down /just the way it happened." It is a sad but fitting tribute to a great poet, dedicated to his art despite adversity and a society that might poten- tially call him out for not being "productive." It is difficult to imagine a poet more dedicated to his work and to his standards of quality than was William Stafford. Thanks to this elegant and well-edited edition, many more will know his work.
