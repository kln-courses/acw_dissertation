<plain_text><page sequence="1">MANKIND IN THE MAKING, William Howells, 382 pp., $4.95, Doubleday &amp; Company, New York, 1959. One of the neglected areas in secondary schools, existing in the "No-Man's Land" between biology and the social studies, is physical anthropology. This book is an excellent effort by a distinguished anthropologist to put the findings of this science into an easily readable form for student and teacher. The arrangement of the book is an intro- ductory set of chapters on evolution, and verte- brates, mammals, and primates, followed by a series of historical sketches on the discovery and significance of various skeletal materials, and concluded by chapters on the various races. The author uses an easy style with many references of a personal nature to the prominent anthropologists who have made the important finds of skeletal material of human and sub-human remains. All of this wealth of evidence is then used to piece to- gether a probable explanation of man's past with USEFUL OPTICAL BARGAINS!

DIFCO LABORATORIES DETROIT 1 MICHIGAN USA its many mysteries clearly indicated. Sometimes the author assumes an almost anthropomorphic teleology in his tour de force explaining the di- rection of human evolution, but there is no doubt that this is one of the most lucid, readable, and carefully up-to-date accounts of man's history. If the biology teacher is ready to assume some initiative with the social studies teacher in getting some physical anthropology in the student's courses somewhere, this book will probably be the major reference.
