Collection of Karen and Robert Duncan, Lincoln, Neb. (artwork © Elizabeth King; photograph © Lynton Gardiner). The sculpture is a small articulated right hand, half life-size (6X2X2 in.), carved of English boxwood. A stop-action animation made with the hand shows it in motion: a sequence of fleeting involuntary gestures (a five-minute loop). The animation, built of 6,350 high-resolution photographs played directly from a computer hard drive, has been rotated to make the onscreen hand a left hand. The sculpture itself is mounted on a stand and placed before the screen, relit for a close match. The two hands—one in motion, the other live—make a pair.</page><page sequence="2">NOTES FROM THE FIELD Anthropomorphism Elizabeth King I have been working on a new bronze head. Yesterday I finished smoothing out the inside walls of the casting, with my small flex-shaft grinder. People forget bronze sculptures are hollow, even small ones like this. The head is exactly half life-size, and open at the back so I can get inside. It is a self portrait. I cast the back of the head as a separate piece to fit on later, like a surgeon replacing a section of skull; the occipital hatch. Why so smooth, these inside walls? They will not be visible once the head is closed. Nonetheless, the interior must be coherent, habitable. The bronze perimeter is thin and strong; I caliper the wall: a little over one-eighth-inch thick. Today I'm working on the openings: nostrils, eyes, ears, mouth—the ele gant apertures of the head. Our points of congress with the world. In spite of our knowledge, we persist in feeling that when we close our eyes, we adjourn to a private interior, our sovereign estate, something we experience as a space. We move around in here, arranging this and that, checking the windows. But gazing out, across the contested territory between our separate bodies, we shudder at the terrible darkness in an other's ear, another's nostril. How far in do we dare look? Can I sculpt in a bit farther, maybe all the way in, to be sure I represent that darkness? I hold the head and bring the spinning grinder bur through the open back and into the ear canal from the inside—steady!—while eyeing the operation from the outside. Looking in the tunnel from one end at my bur entering from the other, with tiny strokes I refine the negative shape of the curved passage. Is there an exact boundary between outside and inside? Sculpting the open mouth is a particularly difficult chal lenge. One would like an exhibition of works on just this theme (Bernini's Costanza, Houdon's Diderot...). Two ex traordinary examples were on view last year in exhibitions in the United States. The Sacred Made Real: Spanish Painting and Sculpture 1600-1700, at the National Gallery of Art, Washing ton, D.C., brought us Pedro de Mena's 1663 Saint Francis Standing in Ecstasy (Fig. I).1 A small polychrome figure carved of wood, the saint stands in arrest on an ebony plinth, pale face suspended in the dark recess of the drawn cowl, glass eyes raised under real eyelashes, mouth open to reveal two uneven rows of ivory teeth (some missing), the teeth parted over a black interior. Years ago I had searched for this figure in Toledo. The day I visited, it was all but a shadow in the cathedral, installed in the sacristy many paces behind a closed balustrade. In Washington, you could step up to within inches of the vitrine. The sculpture was lit with subdued but focused precision (what saint lit this show?). One tooth caught a tiny highlight and glinted from within the mouth. You see this and catch your breath—then realize the figure, too, is inhaling. No mistaking it: the contracted lift of the head, beard just sprung free of the cowl, indrawn gulp at the mouth and jaw, taut chest: an inspired pressure at the back of the throat is inferred from every part visible around it. All who looked at this sculpture held their breath. A more hyperbolic performance was Franz Xaver Messer schmidt's The Yawner, in a formidable lineup of Messer schmidt's character heads at the Neue Galerie in New York (Fig. 2).2 Has any sculptor, save the great eighteenth-century Italian anatomists of La Specola, undertaken so close a study of the floor of the mouth? The underside of the lifted tongue, the frenulum, sublingual caruncle, and salivary ducts, delicate connective epithelium—Messerschmidt has executed every clinical detail. A sculptor's paradise of ridges, bumps, grooves, hollows, and undercuts. So thin is the mem brane beneath the tongue that the body absorbs a drug faster here than by swallowing, and the thermometer best reports our fever. But yawning this fevered head is not! Air is rushing out of the mouth, not in. The eyes squeeze shut so tightly that the forehead and cheeks buckle into a rack of bulges and fissures. Veins stand out on the temples. The upper lip is pulled back from the teeth. The jaw contracts back into the neck, not out from it, to marshal strength to the larynx. Could we hear the sound that goes with this face, we would never lean in for so close a look. A third head, to calm down: this one with mouth closed, holding its tongue, but in possession of palpable interior volume. It is the Head Called "Lajuwa" in the exhibition Dynasty and Divinity: Ife Art in Ancient Nigeria, on tour in Europe and the United States from 2009 to 2012 (Fig. 3).3 A life-size terra-cotta portrait, dated between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries, this head is as poised and self-contained as the Messerschmidt is torqued and agape. Those muscles that hold the body at full attention are in supple play across the face. The fall of light allows us to identify the slight sinus swells at forehead and flanking the nose, the lift of the muscle orbiting the mouth, the modulated rise of the cheekbone intercepted by the faint crease beneath the eye. Our eye is caught almost more by these zones of transitional contour than by the nameable features, although each of these— mouth, nose, eye, and ear—delivers a smaller topology of quickening curves. The mouth in particular, most powerful symbol in Yoruba oral culture, is articulated as a coherent set of muscles in near perfect equipoise. Nose and ear openings penetrate through to the hollow interior ("the nose, imu, the source of ventilation for the soul"4). I am struck by a para doxical evenness of pressure in the rise and fall of the flesh. Perhaps the air of composure arises from this buoyant even ness. Flesh and air: there is breath in this clay head. Ife sculpture is famous for its depiction of nobility of character. Who was Lajuwa? Oral tradition identifies him as steward to a ruling Ooni, who usurped the throne after concealing his master's death. He was beheaded when the ruse was discov ered.3 The portrait head, like its subject, is a noble deception.</page><page sequence="3">12 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2012 VOLUME XCIV NUMBER 1 1 Pedro de Mena, Saint Francis Standing in Ecstasy, detail, 1663, polychromed wood, glass, cord, and human hair, with plinth, 38V4 X 13 X 12V4 in.

Toledo Cathedral (artwork in the public domain; photograph provided by the Instituto del Patrimonio Cultural de Espana, Ministerio de Cultura) As are the tricks by which the sculptor gains access to the interior of a form. One might almost expect Mena to have carved not just the inside of the saint's mouth, but the throat and very trachea to the lung. Close to it: the face was carved as a separate piece, the mouth hollowed out from the back, eyes and teeth set in place, and the whole then fastened like a mask into the deep concavity of the cowl.6 The medium, and sometimes the method, provides the way in. The lost-wax casting process makes a hollow shell that is filled with molten metal. Messerschmidt gives us two hollows, the cavern of the mouth and behind it the hollow of the head, cast in tin. Terra-cotta, "baked earth," must be hollow to be fired, and one can imagine the Ife sculptor coiling the wet clay with hands both inside and out. Indeed, the interior walls of the Lajiiwa are so smooth the coils are barely visible. The sculptor finds the way in, then holds the door open for us. Wood, tin, clay. Sculpture can do this. It can take us from outside to inside. A carving made long ago addresses us via our common nerve. We are sensitive to the minute angle of the head to the neck. Imitators all, we practice the angle unconsciously as we look. And the pose itself reaches back ward into our somatic repertoire and selects the originating emotion, reverse engineers it. We look at a little statue and say, "Oh, this is Saint Francis receiving the stigmata." And our own mouth drops open. And we are wounded.

Willis) For better or for worse (according to some, for much worse), art would appear to be the natural abode of anthropomor phism. Every artwork—of whatever media—could be consid ered as a moment in an endless effort to ascribe human form to the forever nonhuman, as if we could only make sense of our humanity by seeing it projected onto what is patently other than human. This thought is certainly the quietly insis tent leitmotif of Werner Herzog's film Cave of Forgotten Dreams (2011). Sweeping across the walls of the Chauvet cave in southern France, Herzog's camera reveals a throbbing me nagerie of horses, bison, reindeer, lions, antelopes, almost all with faces that spontaneously bear the inscription of human</page><page sequence="5">14 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2012 VOLUME XCIV NUMBER 1 emotion (intense, angry, frightened), or two rhinos, horns locked, fiercely fighting it out. Animals depicted as fighting, fleeing, hunting, roaring proudly, and whinnying nervous ly—how else might one describe such behavior, apart from saying that we—artists and spectators alike—spontaneously and inevitably ascribe emotion and meaning to the move ments of the animals, movements that are never perceived as raw or uncoded but always interpreted as actions? Herzog's assertions, that we here witness "the beginnings of the mod ern human soul" and that the superimposed drawings of an animal's legs in different positions create a sense of move ment, a kind of "protocinema," jointly take us to the preci pice of an argument binding art and anthropomorphism: art in its earliest fulfillment (these 32,000-year-old drawings are too sophisticated and accomplished to be thought of as raw beginnings) and the animistic art of the moving image are joined in their commitment to anthropomorphism, which is construed, in turn, as a fundamental mechanism of soul making. The argument's finale comes into view with the sole in scription of a human figure in Chauvet: the drawing of the forequarters of a bison embracing the sex of a naked woman. This image offers the fierce critical reminder—everywhere in evidence in Herzog's cinema—that projection of the human onto the nonhuman is simultaneously a projection, in return, of the nonhuman onto the human. In its serious guises, anthropomorphism cannot avoid being aware of itself as an effort of projection; it inevitably tracks what resists the hu man, what is inhuman in the human, the trembling place where humanism and antihumanism touch. For Herzog, that place is fathomless. But Herzog's routine flirtation with mys ticism can be ignored, for what is necessary here is only to acknowledge the aesthetic image—as the meeting ground of human and nonhuman, form and matter, Apollonian and Dionysian, world and earth—as excessive to the claims of a rationalized cognition that would seek to capture and dis place it. Of course, stating the matter in this heroic way utterly misstates the role of anthropomorphism in modern thought. From the launching of the term in the eighteenth century (the concept is ancient, already a trope when it is used by Xenophanes in the fifth century BCE), anthropomorphism has functioned primarily as a term of abuse—as a critical concept delimiting a perennial, yet nonetheless utterly illu sory habit of thought. How could anthropomorphism fail to be anything but an act of falsifying the appearance of what is emphatically nonhuman and, on this account, a reduction of the objective to the forever merely subjective? Enlightenment is one name given to the ruthless critique of anthropomor phism. Enlightenment, in Theodor Adorno and Max Hork heimer's perspicuous account, is constituted by the reitera tive practice of detaching the objective from subjective effects (including those perceptual and sensory), which is, itself, a fair description of the project and practice of modern sci ence.1 Construals of modern science exist that interpret it as a form of anthropomorphism, but the dominant ideology of scientific naturalism wagers that truth is just the systematic overcoming of anthropomorphism until an absolute concep tion of the universe is achieved.2 From here, it becomes tempting to romantically stage the fundamental debate about the meaning of modern life as occurring between the artistic inscription of the unavoidability of anthropomorphism on the one hand, against the scientific project of its extirpation on the other hand; the triumph of the latter would be com plete when even the human is understood in nonhuman— causal, mathematical, mechanistic—terms.3 It will come as news to no one that such a staging of the debate over modernity would flatly belie the history of mod ern art. Any robust history of modernism would have to include art's own immersion in Enlightenment rationalism, which is to say, modernism's many-sided attempt to join art making with the overcoming of anthropomorphic projection. In a brutal condensation of much of the scholarly literature, the achievement of Cubism can be interpreted as promising an art premised on de-skilling, on photographic techniques, and so forth, in favor of an increasingly mechanical and serial abstraction. Completing this thought, Rosalind Krauss urges that if "the photographic image is notoriously spun out from a single negative, the structure arrived at by abstract paint ers—the grids, the nested squares, the monochromes, the color fields—are themselves submitted to the mark of the multiple. . . . The logic of abstraction ... is, then, a fight against the unique, the original, the nonreplicable."4 From this view, Krauss castigates Pablo Picasso for a retreat into classicism after Cubism. Against the background of the cele bration of the abstract and mechanical, it is but a short step to the processes of digital imaging that relocate vision "to a plane severed from a human observer," in which the human body becomes "a component of new machines, economies, apparatuses," making subjectivity "a precarious condition of interface between rationalized systems of exchange and net works of information."5 When anthropomorphism is regarded as the constitutive malady of the human mind, what began as the philosophical project to destroy the gods and to construct an immanent universe in their stead devolves into a generalized misan thropy in which the human placement in the natural world and the perspectival torsions of bodily experience are inter preted as if they were themselves privative, as if the vital human is nothing other than a source of error besmirching the abstract and the replicable. The idea that anthropomor phism is the primary malady of the human mind is fueled by at least two sources: a materialism that reacts against a view of the universe as composed of mysterious mind stuff and math ematically knowable matter and an opposing tendency, the desire to separate the (rational/ensouled) human from both the nonhuman animal and the causal forces of material nature. Both sources—the misanthropic and the narcissis tic— depend on the blind omission of the self-moving, animate, animal world of living things to which humans belong. My impression is that in both art and criticism, the exor bitant postmodern critique of anthropomorphism has, of a sudden, wilted—and with good reason. When human subjec tivity is artistically actualized in works possessing touch, style, signature, uniqueness, and originality, the result is not a blinded subjectivism but the normal formation of cultural objectivity, of soul making, as Herzog would express it. There is a lovely irony in Herzog's use of primitive 3-D technology, not just in celebrating the power of the Chauvet cave draw</page><page sequence="6">NOTES FROM THE FIELD: ANTHROPOMORPHISM \§ ings but, equally, in locating his technologically mediated art as arising from the same anthropomorphic impulses as those that inspired our great artistic progenitors.

Carolyn Dean All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.—George Orwell, Animal Farm, chap. 101 Anthropomorphism depends on the notion that human be ings are different, whether in appearance or behavior, from other species of animals and, indeed, distinct from all other kinds of things. This is accepted despite the fact that many of those traits that have been said to differentiate human beings from all other animals have been proven not to be exclusively human, including the use of tools, a sense of humor, and abstract reasoning. In Orwell's terms, although human be ings know that they are animals, they hold themselves to be "more equal" than other animals. But do all people really think this way? Is "human" even a particularly important category of beings universally? Here we may have a problem of terms: whether our understanding of what is meant by "human being" is identical to, somewhat similar to, or com pletely at odds with the perceptions of other people in distant times and places. "Human beings" is commonly translated into Quechua, the dominant indigenous language of the Andes of western South America, as runa. Quechua itself is called Runasimi, which means "human language." Logic would imply either that only Quechua speakers are fully human or that there is something else going on. That same something else (or something very similar to it) goes on in many parts of the world where linguistic commonality supersedes species iden tification. Accordingly, the words translated into English as "people" or "human beings" would be more accurately trans lated as "beings who speak my language," while the category "human beings" would not exist at all. Many indigenous Andean peoples categorize human beings into complemen tary groups: "us" and "those like us." Together, these two groups form a set that can be described as "inside"; the "inside" set is then distinguished from the set comprising "other people." Historically, the set "other people" has been located outside culture since, from an insider perspective, "other people" did not share cultural beliefs and practices (including some linguistic commonality) with "us" and "those Notes 1.

In addition to "others like us," many native South American groups recognized commonality with spirit entities and animals who, while not "us" or "people like us," were certainly closer to "us" than were the set comprising "other people."2 Under this system, would anthropomorphism imply likeness with "us" or with "other people" (and so not like "us" at all)? Indeed, is the term anthropomorphism even helpful, since it suggests a unified category—that of human beings— that has not been significant to many Andean peoples across history? Michel Foucault most famously entered into the debate over ways of categorizing things in his book Les mots et les choses, translated into English as The Order of Things. As Fou cault discusses in the preface, his influential study was appar ently inspired by an animal taxonomy featured in a book by Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986), the Argentine essayist and poet, who provided a list of animal categories derived from a mysterious ancient Chinese compendium entitled the Celes tial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge.3 The Chinese encyclo pedia divided animals into an odd assortment of categories, including "those that are trained," "mermaids," "those that have just broken the flower vase," and "suckling pigs." Un fortunately, Borges may have been a bit of a trickster: al though the Argentine author cited Franz Kuhns (1884 1961), a well-known German scholar and translator of Chinese literature, there exists no actual evidence that Kuhns ever discovered or translated such a taxonomy.4 Despite the apparently fictional nature of the Celestial Emporium, Fou cault's point about the historical and cultural specificity of categories of things is well taken. Human beings order their perceptions of the universe of things in ways that fit their experiences of the world, even if their taxonomies are not so astoundingly uncanny as those created by Borges. Consider the Inka of western South America, who reached the height of their power in the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. The Inka identified certain rocks as sharing many characteristics with human beings. Such rocks were sentient and had the ability to speak and move. They were said to eat and drink the foods and liquids humans eat and drink, dress</page><page sequence="7">10 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2012 VOLUME XCIV NUMBER 1 in human clothing, and speak Runasimi. The puruawqa, for example, were a group of rocks who became animate in order to help the Inka defeat a powerful enemy. After the battle, the puruawqa repetrified, with the promise to spring to life again to defend Inka territory should the need arise. Visitors to the Inka capital were introduced to various named puru awqa, who were positioned around the city, consulted on matters of significance to the state, and given gifts. Certainly the puruawqa could be described as anthropomorphic. Rather than pronouncing them as such, however, we may reveal more and be more accurate by defining them as Inka "insiders," understood by the Inka as being "like us." The Inka recognized the humanity of lowland Amazonian dwellers whom they called And (or Chunchu), though they were definitely not part of the set "humans like us." The Anti were said to be cannibals who did not practice agriculture, live in houses (by which the Inka meant permanent dwell ings), wear clothes (by which the Inka meant clothing of woven fabric), nor did they follow Inka gender norms. Inka rhetoric tells us that the Anti were less like the Inka than were the petrous puruawqa. In these cases, the category "human beings" and its adjectival comparative "anthropomorphic" obscure categories and comparisons even more fundamental to Inka thinking. The Inka understood that rocks could host various es sences, and valiant warriors like the puruawqa were just one example. Other essences embodied by rocks included the spirits of places, culture heroes, and even the Inka ruler himself, who existed simultaneously in flesh and lithic form. Caroline van Eck Anthropomorphism, endowing artifacts with human forms or characteristics, is an almost universal feature of creating and understanding art. In medieval and Renaissance architec ture, it provided formal patterns for design and metaphors to understand architectural form.1 In the nineteenth century, a new variety of anthropomorphism arose in the aesthetics of empathy, or Einfuhlung, which explained the artworks' effects on the mind by relating those effects to human shapes and to the physical or psychological processes they expressed.2 Per haps the boldest attribution of human traits in the history of art, Aby Warburg's vision of art's history as a process of remembrance and revival, of Mnemosyne and Nachleben, hu manized the succession of events related to art.3 Warburg's vision of art history cast away chronological and stylistic de velopment, the collection of successive events and actions that together make up history, in favor of an understanding of art history as a process of human, psychological retrieval and of images that appeared to migrate through time. In the course of the twentieth century anthropomorphism underwent significant change. In modernist architecture, in Le Corbusier's Modulor, for instance, the analogy between the building and the human body continued to play a role. After 1945, however, anthropomorphism came to be consid The Inka acknowledged a basic similarity between rocks and themselves that cannot be fully characterized as anthropo morphism. To practice anthropomorphism is to employ a category that does not resonate universally. The more rele vant category for the Inka is "like us," whether human, an other kind of animal, spirit entity, or rock. Carolyn Dean, professor of pre-Hispanic and Colonial Latin Amer ican visual culture, the University of California, Santa Cruz, re searches Inka visual and performance culture before and after Span ish colonization. Her recent book, A Culture of Stone: Inka Perspectives on Rock (Duke University Press, 2010), considers various aspects of Inka rock work [History of Art and Visual Culture Department, University of California, 1156 High Street, Santa Cruz, Calif 95064, csdean@ucsc.edu].

In art and architecture, modernist abstraction and defiguration took over, while in art history, Heinrich Wolfflin's formalism gave way to Erwin Panofsky's iconology. Recently, anthropomorphism has returned as a hermeneu tic mode. The Paris exhibition Une image pent en cacher une autre (One image may hide another) of 2009 brought to gether a vast collection of double images that, on closer inspection, revealed human faces and figures.4 Instead of the reassuring insight that buildings turn out to conform to human features, the conceit of anthropomorphism in Renais sance architecture, viewers at the Paris exhibition became aware that what looked like a hill or a crevice in a rock in a Hieronymus Bosch landscape turned out to be a face staring at them. In viewing, recognition gave way to an uncanny sense of human life where one did not expect to find it. The Paris exhibition thus asked to what degree the human form is inevitable in shaping what viewers see, and which psycholog ical and perceptual processes are involved in recognition. In a seminar on the fear of images, directed by Luc Bachelot and Claude Pouzadoux at Nanterre, that brings together</page><page sequence="8">NOTES FROM THE FIELD: ANTHROPOMORPHISM \*J archaeologists, ancient historians, and philosophers, fear of the image is linked in another anthropomorphic move to fear of the body: here, the image is considered to be an embodiment. As such, the image inspires the same fears and desires as the human body itself.5 Alfred Gell's 1998 book Art and Agency has presented a new, anthropological variety of attributing human characteristics to art, which he terms agency and personhood.6 Gell's book, an anthropological theory of art, arises from the idea of the art nexus, meaning the network of social relations in which artworks are embedded, while art objects, for their part, are considered to be systems of actions. According to Gell, these actions are intended to change the world rather than to encode symbolic propositions about it. Artworks thus become equivalent to persons, or, more particularly, to social agents. Gell's move from anthropomorphism to anthropology has already had a considerable impact. In inquiries into idolatry and iconoclasm, for example, Gell's theory enables the study of viewer response, and it also facilitates the analysis of re sponse in a much wider, non-Eurocentric context. The Lei den research project "Art, Agency and Living Presence," which brings together art and theater historians, philoso phers, and psychologists, has conducted a series of very de tailed case studies on early modern instances in which viewers attributed human and social life to works of art. Gell's art nexus has here proven to possess considerable heuristic value, allowing a fine-grained and historically grounded un derstanding of early modern behavior, including the ways in which viewers made sense of such apparently irrational be havior as people kissing paintings, taking them to bed, or depriving statues of their eyes. Elsje van Kessel, for instance, has shown how Venetian viewers treated the portrait of Bianca Capello by Scipione Pulzone, a sixteenth-century Venetian patrician who eloped with a Florentine to become grand duchess of Tuscany, as the living person it represented. These viewers kissed the por trait, talked to it, and took "her" to visit the doge, who asked it to stay the night. By reconstructing the nexus in which the portrait acted, van Kessel has shown in what sense the portrait had a social life. Moreover, she has reconstructed the viewing attitudes and social and political agendas its spectators brought with them. By so integrating archival research, art historical analysis, social history, and anthropology, van Kes sel has made such apparently irrational behavior understand able. Joris van Gastel, meanwhile, has studied the interaction between sculptor, viewer, and statue in seventeenth-century Roman sculpture. He has integrated well-known and often rehearsed topics of praise, such as the speaking likeness, or vivacitd,, with recent psychological research into synesthesia and the embodied character of perception.7 One of the main results of the Leiden program is a new awareness of the importance of sculpture and the reactions it evokes, and with it, a reconsideration of viewer responses claiming that the statue they see is alive. Far from being a hackneyed cliche, a trite rehearsal of ut pictura poesis, the living statue became the focus of a large variety of texts on sculpture from Europe and other parts of the world, ranging from the ethnographic studies of fetishism by Charles de Brosses and Octavien de Guasco to Johann Joachim Winck elmann and Antoine-Chrysostome Quatremere de Quincy's histories of classical sculpture and polychromy.8 In their treatment of viewer response, we can observe the birth of modern anthropological approaches to fetishism on the one hand, and the development of academic art history and the birth of the art museum on the other hand, in which art works, exhibited for aesthetic appreciation or art historical anal ysis, are at the same time deprived of their life and agency. Gell made the attribution of personhood, emotions, agency, or animation to artworks a psychological and social phenomenon that can be studied in fieldwork. His recent, anthropological variety of anthropomorphism thereby opens up the possibility of interdisciplinary research into the rela tions between works of art and their viewers. As the Leiden project demonstrates, art history, anthropology, and psychol ogy can collaborate on the study of these relations. The Berlin project, led by Horst Bredekamp, on empathy and embodiment; the Harvard project, directed by Frank Fehren bach, on liveliness, or Lebendichkeit, as well as the research of psychologists, such as Alva Noe on action in perception, or Lawrence Barsalou on grounded cognition, show us that our viewing of art is ultimately founded on our own experience as embodied beings.9 The new developments signaled here have in common that they posit the human as the foundation for any understand ing of art. One of the major challenges for art history in the twenty-first century will be the transformation of one of the discipline's core beliefs—the significant relation between art and man, expressed in anthropomorphism—into a bridge between the humanities and the social sciences.

Finbarr Barry Flood In Henry James's short story The Last of the Valerii (1874, revised 1885), the eponymous Conte Valerio falls in thrall to the charms of a malign statue of the goddess Juno, excavated at his villa. Enchanted by the marble sculpture, the count revives a form of polytheistic worship inflected by amorous desire. Revealing the situation to the count's hapless wife, the narrator explains: "In a word, dear child, Marco is an anthro pomorphist. Do you know what that means?" Fortunately, the count's wife understands perfectly and saves the day by or dering the reinterment of the enchanting statue. Despite the occultation of the object of the count's desire (not entirely, since he retains the marble hand of the goddess), the narra tor concludes that he "never became, if you will, a thoroughly modern man."1 To be an anthropomorphist is, it seems, to be at odds with modernity. The first recorded English use of the term anthro pomorphism is in 1753, during the height of the Enlighten ment, when it was used to denote the erroneous ascription of human form to the deity. This imputation of religious error was informed by new and specifically European formulations of the rational, but its polemical thrust was common to cognate terms deployed much earlier in monotheistic polem ics to name conceptual errors often associated with idolatry. The pejorative connotations of "anthropomorphism" (and its cognates) in both theological and secular polemics highlight the generally tendentious nature of the term as applied to two distinct problems of iconicity. Historically, the most fun damental of these has been the conceptualization and rep resentation of divinity, specifically, the question of whether a transcendental deity or deities could be embodied or should be depicted in embodied form. The issue is not exclusive to monotheism; polytheistic cultures have always had dissenters on this question. Even within Judaism and Islam, seen as the most aniconic of faiths, biblical and Qur'anic verses apparently impute not only form (and, thus, spatial qualities) to a transcendental deity but also attributes common to man, including eyes, feet, fingers, and hands. Readings that took these passages as transparent descriptions were generally rejected as literalist errors. However, anthropomorphic conceptions of God may have been relatively common in the early Islamic world; one early tradition (considered heterodox, if not heretical) even identified a mark on the rock within the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem (692) as the footprint of God himself. Similarly, the anthropomorphic language of mystical Judaism provided ammunition for Christian polemicists such as Agobard, the bishop of Lyons (writing about 840), who accused the Jews of idolatry by virtue of their literal investment in a corporeal God who resembled man in all respects except that the fingers of his hand did not fold, since he had no need to work with them. One notable aspect of anthropomorphist traditions in monotheism is their presentation of the divine body in dis crete parts: hands, fingers, feet. Perhaps not serendipitously, this is a quality that scriptural and mystical evocations of the deity share with the profane phenomenon of premodern prosopopoeia, in particular, the inscription on factured ob jects of poetic and other texts written in the first-person voice. Insofar as these texts anthropomorphize the objects to which they give voice, they usually offer a fragmented evocation of the body—referring to breasts, faces, mouths, and so forth— that frustrates the conception of a corporeal whole. This reticence brings to mind the role that the fragmentation of the (re)presented body has often played in satisfying the desires of both iconophiles and iconoclasts, Conte Valerio's retention of Juno's marble hand being a case in point. The production of objects as actors in prosopopoeia high lights a second series of phenomena integral to "anthropomor phism" and perhaps more directly relevant to the discipline of art history. These entail the ascription of agency to apparently inanimate objects. The "presence effects" associated with crafted images that reproduce the human form and are capable of taking on a life of their own as a result are perhaps the most familiar facet of this aspect of anthropomorphism. In The Last of the Valerii, both modes of anthropomor phism—humanizing the deity and animating material forms—are projected onto a remote polytheistic past that erupts into modernity through the ambiguous mediations of an embodied fragment of antiquity. Associating anthropo morphism with pagan fetishism, the tale subscribes to a view of anthropomorphism as a category error contravening dis tinctions between subject and object, animate and inanimate, agentive and passive that have been naturalized and univer salized in post-Enlightenment thought. As an irrational con</page><page sequence="10">NOTES FROM THE FIELD: ANTHROPOMORPHISM J9 fusion of animate life with inanimate matter, the anthropo morphism disdained by moderns resembles the idolatry denounced in the Old Testament as a misapprehension of humanly crafted things that lack breath. Discussing the ascription of agency to images of divinities, the anthropologist Alfred Gell insists on a distinction be tween biological and social life, an approach that has inspired recent attempts to explain "living presence response," the experience of life associated with the perception of anthro pomorphic sculptures.2 However, approaches to anthropo morphism at the level of cognition and culture also highlight an important distinction between the anthropomorphism disdained by premodern theology and modern rationalism, a distinction that operates at the level of ontology. In many pre-Enlightenment traditions, the inanimate idols taken for omnipotent beings find their inverse not in the figure of the deity but in man himself, fashioned from clay (or other matter) and then infused with breath by a divine artist. In Judaism and Christianity at least, the man thus fashioned is made in God's image, a "living icon," as Christian theologians of the post-Iconoclastic period put it. In Christianity, the chiastic paradox of man made in God's image found its ultimate logic in the Incarnation, which provided a powerful imprimatur for anthropomorphic depictions of the deity. The attempt of man, as the living, breathing creation of God, to offer worship to inanimate images crafted by his own hand entails a double hubris that reveals the inadequacy of human artistry. The contrast between human and divine ability in this respect is an ancient theme; after all, Pygma lion's love for Galatea could be consummated only through the intervention of the goddess Venus, who, unlike Pygma lion, possessed the ability to transform his marble creation into a flesh-and-blood woman. The transubstantiations cen tral to these kind of creation narratives in both monotheistic and polytheistic traditions admit the possibility of enlivening inanimate matter. Within these narratives, the anthropos of anthropomorphism is therefore always already constituted in a manner that blurs the oppositions between art and nature, subject and object, physis and techne integral to the modern usage of the term. Although anthropologists and psychologists often see the ascription of agency to nonhuman actors, whether transcen dental deities or alluring marble statues, as a recalcitrant anachronism (albeit one essential to religious belief), they disagree about whether or not anthropomorphism is intui tive.3 The jury is also still out on the related question of whether the distinction between animate and inanimate is hardwired or acquired (or both), although it has been noted that humans tend to ascribe agency and intentionality to moving forms in general, including even self-propelled dots on a screen. Recent suggestions that it is not merely form tout court but specific elements of form—chief among them markings resembling eyes and faces—that are crucial to the development of this distinction in complex animals, including humans, hold an obvious interest for the history of reception.4 The importance of eyes was noted by Sigmund Freud in his classic essay on the uncanny, a condition manifest, in Ernst Jentsch's classic formulation (which Freud rejected), by "doubt as to whether an apparently living being is animate and, conversely, doubt as to whether a lifeless object may not in fact be animate."5 Jentsch's insight that the greater the degree of verisimilitude, the more intense the feeling of the uncanny aroused by anthropomorphic forms has been vali dated by recent work on robotics, which has identified an "uncanny valley," a realm of negative human emotional re sponse to sophisticated simulacra that, counterintuitively, in creases rather than decreases beyond a certain point in direct proportion to the degree of verisimilitude. The locus classi cus of the uncanny is, of course, the corpse, and one likely explanatory factor is that the gap between expectation and performance reminds the observer of her or his own mortality. In The Last of the Valerii, a return to the earth, the ultimate fate of all animate beings, also solves the "problem" of an thropomorphism. Whether one sees this as the pragmatic dispatch of a fetish object or a live burial depends, of course, on whether one identifies with the count or the narrator. From the point of view of the narrator, the statue's disappear ance into its tomb heals a rupture that began with its emer gence, restoring both the ontology and temporality of mo dernity (although not entirely—the severed hand remains to frustrate the undertaking). However, the tale's ending also suggests that the polemics of "anthropomorphism" are rooted in more extensive anxi eties about our own agency and mortality. These anxieties constantly threaten to undermine the ontologies asserted to assuage them, despite the naturalization of the latter as com monsensical and universally valid. Most of us have had the experience of feeling "thwarted" by machines, usually cars and computers, devices with which we have a close haptic relationship and that function in effect as prosthetic exten sions of our distributed personhood. The attribution of agency in extremis may seem cute or quirky. Yet it provides a practical instance of the subversive ontological hybrids of nature and culture, human and nonhuman that Bruno La tour has argued necessarily result from the ontological strat ifications that characterize modernity. Ultimately, the com plex entanglements of mortality and ontology may be relevant to the creation of all images of (potentially) animate beings, and to the tensions between reference and presence that inform their function and reception. Such tensions undermine attempts to relegate anthropomorphism to a dim and dis tant past. As W.J. T. Mitchell (paraphrasing Latour) puts it: "When it comes to images ... we have never been and prob ably never will be modern."'3 Finbarr Barry Flood is the author of Objects of Translation: Material Culture and Medieval "Hindu-Muslim" Encounter (Princeton, 2009), which won the 2011 Ananda K.

Dario Gamboni "Anthropomorphism" is an explanation I encountered often while researching the artistic use of visual ambiguity for my book Potential Images} A "potential image" is a way of seeing and interpreting visual data that becomes actual with the viewer's subjective participation. When a potential image bears resemblance to a human being or a part thereof, its existence can be attributed to the artist's anthropomorphism, to his or her tendency to attribute humanlike traits to non human realities. If the existence of this image is disputed, then the claim for its existence can be attributed to the interpreter's anthropomorphism. In the latter case, anthropomorphism is rejected as the source of a misguided perception. In the former—for exam ple, in landscape paintings of the Renaissance—it may be accepted as expressing a historically documented worldview.2 But it is a worldview that is obsolete, and for a long time, anthropomorphism has been at best tolerated. It is regarded as an illusion and has accordingly been condemned since at least 1620, when Roger Bacon defined the "Idols of the Tribe" in Novum organum: "And the human understanding is like a false mirror, which, receiving rays irregularly, distorts and discolors the nature of things by mingling its own nature with it."3 While there is no doubt that perception can be misguided, by construing accidental configurations as significant pat terns or by attributing one's own properties to beings and things devoid of them, the validity of all that is subsumed under the term anthropomorphism should not be dismissed without examination. Epistemology pleads against this: there is no object of knowledge without a subject, and even resort ing to mechanical prostheses and mathematical tools does not dispense with the eventual need for the interpretation of data, nor does it rid interpreters of their human characteris tics. As far as art is concerned, the late nineteenth-century "aesthetics of empathy" located the basis for aesthetic com munication in the interaction between object and recipient before John Dewey spoke of "art as experience" and the phenomenologists of "embodied perception."4 The condi tions of this interaction, now studied experimentally by neu roscientists, are not an impediment but a resource that must be harnessed to the study of sensory phenomena.5 "Anthropomorphism" also suffers from being an umbrella term, broad and vague, and often a misnomer. The charac teristics imputed to its effects are often not specific to hu mans but are shared by other animals, by bodies in general, or by all animate entities. In such cases, one should rather speak of "anthrozoomorphism," "somatomorphism," or sim ply animism. During a recent study of the work of Paul Gauguin, I was struck by the frequency with which his depic tions of animals, humans, and deities incorporated plantlike features (Fig. 1). In order to describe this trait, I resorted to what I thought was a neologism, "phytomorphism," until I realized it is in common usage among specialists of other cultural traditions, including Americanists studying Moche ceramics (Fig. 2), a major source of inspiration for Gauguin.6 Pascal Boyer has proposed to distinguish, within anthropo morphism, between the "projection" of anatomical structure, physiological processes, personal identity, social organiza tion, and intentional psychology, as well as between the var ious "source domains" of anthropomorphism, its different types of representations, and the effect of these representa tions on its "target domains."7 Such distinctions are welcome, but Boyer's terminology expresses a unidirectional under standing of the epistemic process epitomized by the notion of "projection," introduced in psychology by Sigmund Freud and generalized by Lawrence K. Franck.8 Hermann Ror schach, author of what is now regarded as the quintessential projective test, never spoke of projection; instead, he aimed at providing a "diagnosis of perception," and he regarded interpretation (Deutung) as a part or moment of perception (Wahrnehmung) itself.9 For Boyer, anthropomorphism originated in religion. This restriction, which I find problematic, permits him to explain how it could survive, over many cycles of cultural transmis sion, as a "salient counterfactual speculation," opposed to intuitive ontological categories and principles. The evidence I encountered so far in my own research does not support this view but agrees, instead, with Stewart Elliott Guthrie's account of anthropomorphism as an effect of the cognitive dimension of perception and "our need to find whatever pattern is most important": "The most important pattern in most contexts is that with the highest organization. The highest organization we know is that of human thought and</page><page sequence="12">NOTES FROM THE FIELD: ANTHROPOMORPHISM 21 1 Paul Gauguin, Vase in the Shape of a Tree Stump, ca. 1887-88, stoneware with slip and gold, 8% X 5% in.

Therefore we typically scan the world with humanlike models."10 Yet philosophical and psychological accounts leave insuffi cient room for variability in the historical and cultural ways in which the relations between ontological categories have been experienced and conceptualized. In an essay on ethnometa physics devoted to the "ontology, behavior, and worldview" of the Ojibwa (one of the largest groups of Native Americans), A. Irving Hallowell has argued that the notion of person entertained by the Ojibwa included "other-than-human per sons": objects (such as stones) that were not permanently animated but possessed a potential for animation associated with specific circumstances and verified by experience.11 Comparable claims are made by anthropologists about the Moche, who lived in northern Peru, mostly on the basis of the interpretation of artifacts such as vases.12 The anthropohistorical relevance of anthropomorphism does not preclude an experiential basis that may extend its validity into the present. As I tried to understand the impulse, in Gauguin ceramics, to combine human and vegetal ele ments, and as I compared them with Moche "Surrealist" tuber vases based on the shape of potatoes (Fig. 2) or manioc, I noticed that their focal points of animated presence, the 2 Stirrup-spout Vessel in the Shape of a Potato with a Human Face, Moche, lst-8th century, earthenware, brown and white paints, 8% X 5'/a in. (21.3 X 14 cm). Museo Arqueologico Rafael Larco Herrera, Lima, Peru (artwork in the public domain; photograph provided by the Museo Larco, Lima—Peru) eyes, are located on the spots—called "eyes" in many lan guages—where plants grow shoots or branches. For the artists concerned, as for the viewers of these objects, the animation process coincided with the morphological expression of the plant's inner dynamism. Similarly, it became clear to me that the cross-cultural use of the ontogenetic development of a plant to represent the phylogenetic development of a human lineage or group (in "genealogical trees") is in agreement with the fact that plants can breed by budding and that trees can be colonies rather than individual organisms.13 I there fore believe it would be worth exploring to what extent certain forms of anthropomorphism can be ascribed not to a unilateral and illusionary projection of human characteristics but to an awareness (obtained by intuition and observation) of the existence of shared morphological traits and morpho genedc principles. This exploration need not be limited to the biological domain, for, as D'Arcy Thompson has shown, forms are shaped by physical laws, and they exhibit regular ities across a broader range of ontological categories.14 Finally, one may do better justice to all that the term anthropomorphism encompasses if one does not assume the existence of a mechanical, indiscriminate impulse to anthro pomorphize—which that ending "ism" deterministically sug</page><page sequence="13">22 art bulletin march 2012 volume xciv number 1 gests—but examines instead concrete acts of "anthropomor phosis," to use a term that aligns with metamorphosis. We can note that one rarely speaks of "metamorphism," probably because the principle of metamorphosis is not static but consists in transformation. This, however, is also the case with anthropomorphism, at least quite often. We do not know whether we should call Gauguin's Vase in the Shape of a Tree Stump (Fig. 1) in the shape of a human head an outcome of anthropomorphism or phytomorphism: the point of this ob ject is not a "source domain" or a "target domain" but the meeting between them. Whatever the prefix, morphosis is there fore crucial for images at large. In fact, images tend to be polyiconic so as to connect, and to articulate, several realities.

Jane Garnett and Gervase Rosser In Christ Stopped at Eboli, Carlo Levi's account of village life in the 1930s in the southern Italian province of Basilicata, the visitor in exile marvels at the tutelary deities on display in the houses of the local peasants. In each case, two images, and two only, preside on the wall above the bed: the dark and ominous visage of the local cult statue of the Madonna di Viggiano and the broadly smiling face of American President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In a desperately poor environment in which the hope of material salvation lay in emigration across the Atlantic and that of simple survived was entrusted to the Virgin Mary, each presence had its raison d'etre. The study of mirac ulous images continually encounters such juxtapositions within the quotidian life of the home and the street. In the Italian city of the present, the Madonna of the street corner continues to observe and, intermittently, to engage the attention of the pass erby—to contest the boundary between the sacred and the secular. In one of the narrow alleys of the old port of Genoa, a prostitute until recently kept flowers before the shrine of a Madonna, which was lit by her own red light. Business-suited men on their way to work enter the cathedral of Chiavari to speak to the miraculous Madonna of the Garden. The attempt to understand the place of the reputedly miraculous image in the lives of its devotees presents partic ular problems, not least that of establishing a necessary de gree of empathy for the subject without becoming its apolo gist. Much of our work (for a forthcoming book on miraculous images in Italy and beyond, between 1500 and 2000) has consisted of reading and listening to stories: the dominant medium of this kind of image is not the direct sight of the venerated statue or picture but the story told about it. To find oneself in the side chapel of a church with an elderly woman who confides the graces worked in her life by the medieval crucifix on the wall is to appreciate how such a narrative, by its very telling, seeks and finds validation. It is also to perceive how far the engagement with a certain image may be invested with past experience and memory: a complex of sensory and imaginative qualities that together extend far be yond present visual perception.

Bacigalupo, Ex voto a Montallegro [Comune di Rapallo, 1989], pi. xxvi, reproduced by permission) merely art history's preoccupation with aesthetic quality. The very language that we habitually use of images— of figuration, representation, expression—threatens to be reductive in this case. The language of the "visual" is inadequate to capture the ways in which the image is experienced. Sounds, smells, musical cadences, atmosphere, movement, reflections of can dlelight in a puddle beneath a street shrine—all can trigger connections and signal the zones within which the miracu lous can be felt. Context, therefore, is vital, yet context does not suffice to explain the experience of the supernatural. The belief in the miraculous powers of an image and the behavior that results from such belief throw into heightened relief the usual difficulties of historical interpretation. One of the principal challenges is that of grasping a concept of the mysterious that for believers readily coexists with the familiar and the everyday: that which resists explanation sits along side, and within, that which demands no explanation. What Michel de Certeau wrote of mystical literature applies to the interpretation of miraculous images. To transpose his meta phor, miracle-working images "mark out the boundaries of an 'elsewhere' which is not remote, a place which they both produce and guard."1 Not confined to its wall or its street shrine, the miraculous image extends its presence, through its reproductions but also through the imagination of its human devotees, across an extendable space and over a lifetime. A man's childhood memory of the annual feast of the Madonna of Recco in the early 1900s captured both its dynamism and its multisensual ity. In his recollection, the conventional prayer on his lips was silenced by the spectacle of gold catching the last of the evening sun and of fireworks erupting, by the sound of bells as the Virgin was carried out of the church, and by the imagined sensation, as he closed his eyes, of clutching the silk of her dress while she looked down on him—an intensely private moment yet felt and reenacted annually as part of a devotional community. The shared ownership of reproduc tions of, and stories about, a miraculous image creates com munities with particular spatial and temporal coordinates. In the 1640s, when the bell rang at the Genoese church of the Madonna delle Vigne to announce the regular Saturday af ternoon sermon in the chapel of a miraculous statue of the Virgin, in every house within earshot candles were lit at that moment before engraved copies of the venerated Madonna. Stories can reinforce an extended community of votaries of a particular image over far greater distances—a patria trans ported beyond the ocean by the gaze of the image. A painted ex-voto sent to the sanctuary of Montallegro in Liguria in 1871 depicts three members of the Costa family of Rapallo, lying side by side in sickbeds in Buenos Aires (Fig. 1). On the wall above them is depicted the copy, which they certainly</page><page sequence="15">24 art bulletin march 2012 volume xciv number 1 possessed, of the miraculous Montallegro icon of the Death of the Virgin—the embodiment of the community to which, even at so great a distance, they felt themselves to belong. Unwell, their thoughts turned to the image, and once recov ered, they commissioned this thanks offering for the shrine. These tales and habits create the context for the miraculous: when the need arises, they help to make sense of the convic tion that the Madonna has saved a life or averted disaster. A familiar background presence in daily life, the image shifts occasionally into sharper focus, claiming concentrated atten tion through narratives that partake at once of the supernat ural and the ordinary.

James Meyer Modernist art historians have long held the idea of anthro pomorphism at arm's length. What's so troubling, embarrass ing even, about this notion? When did anthropomorphism get a bad name? Is there not, first of all, a certain fraudulence in this word human which is always being thrown in our faces? ... A certain anthropocentric atmosphere, vague but imbuing all things, give[s] the world its so-called signification; that is, investing it from within by a more or less disingenuous network of sentiments and thoughts.1 In "Nature, Humanism, Tragedy," an essay of 1958, Alain Robbe-Grillet established the terms of an antianthropomorphic discourse whose reverberations are still felt. Note the semantic slippage in his writing: anthropomorphism, a principle of re semblance ("the attribution of human characteristics to a god, animal, or object"),2 is renamed anthropocentrism, the invest ment of things with a metaphysical substance. Anthropocen trism is the misguided belief that the world is inherently mean ingful and that human beings can order reality in a meaningful way. Things do not so much resemble us as they exist for us. In Donald Judd's critical writings of the 1960s, anthropo morphism and anthropocentricism also became homologous.3 Judd observed, for instance, that Mark di Suvero's sculptures resembled "truncated bodies." "A beam thrusts, a piece of iron follows a gesture. Together they form a naturalistic and anthro pomorphic image."4 Di Suvero's wood beams and metal ele ments suggest a figurative arrangement. His sculptures imply a space inhabited by a human figure.3 This space (imagined, virtual) has been organized in such a way that a viewer will comprehend and master it. Di Suvero's works evoke a rational system of representation, what Judd called the tradition of "Eu ropean" art, stretching back to Nicolas Poussin and before. Judd claimed to have rejected this inheritance, since his artworks embodied a provisional order at best.6 We can identify the materials comprising one of his boxes, how the artwork has been made, and how it holds its shape. We can perceive the screws and steel wires joining the sides and the floor on which it stands. Yet a sculpture by Judd resists attributions of meaning fulness. AJudd is. Like those objects, devoid of meaning or affect, described with such excruciating precision by Robbe Grillet in his novel Jealousy, a Judd box posits no "truths" beyond the mere fact of its existence. During the 1960s, then, critiques of anthropomorphism and anthropocentrism typically went hand in hand. A third term was subsequently introduced into the discursive field, which I will call the bodily. The seminal critical debates of this period centered on the dialectic of the anthropomorphic and the bodily. Judd, however, never got around to describ ing the spectator of Minimalist work; that was left to Robert Morris. Morris conceived this viewer as a body, and though this word has become a cliche of postfeminist and Fou cauldian theory, it is imperative to understand the initial import of the term for Minimalist theory.7 Morris envisioned the viewer as a somatic being. The new sculpture was exact ingly scaled, he explained, for it was meant to be experienced by an active spectator who would circulate around it, com paring its actual shape with the mental impression, or Gestalt, of its form, in the mind's eye. The same size as a viewer, the sculpture impressed the fact of its existence—its object ness—on the beholder. In 1967, in "Art and Objecthood," Michael Fried suggested that to be confronted by these bulky objects was "not entirely unlike being distanced ... by the silent presence of another person."8 Fried turned the mean ing of the anthropomorphic on its head. Instead of the beholder endowing the art object with meaningfulness, the viewer of the Minimalist work was the subject of a manipula tive—a "theatrical"—encounter. Judd imagined the Minimal ist artwork as having escaped anthropocentric projection.</page><page sequence="16">NOTES FROM THE FIELD: ANTHROPOMORPHISM 25 Fried insisted that it reminds us of other bodies. The new sculp ture induces those emotions of isolation, that terrible solipsism we often feel in the presence of others. Rather than escape human associations, Minimal art calls up anthropomorphic sug gestion only to rebuke it. In a brilliant about-face, Fried criti cized Judd's art in the very terms established by the artist.9 "Art and Objecthood" describes two kinds of bodies and emotions: the alienated subjectivity of Minimalism and the tran scendental encounter, the momentary reprieve or "grace" from theatricality experienced by the beholder of modernist art In Passages in Modern Sculpture, Rosalind Krauss revisited the crucial critical exchanges of the preceding period, characterizing the history of modern sculpture since Auguste Rodin as a progres sive dismantling of sculpture's ontological "core."10 In her ac count, the viewer's actual body, which passes around and through the sculpture (the body invoked in Minimalist and Land art), overtakes the beholder of the modernist work, who perceives the artwork's form at a glance. Krauss heralded the defeat of presentness by presence, of the anthropomorphic by the bodily. Yet the anthropomorphic cannot be so easily de feated. For as Fried noted, Minimalist sculpture alludes to and evokes the body in order to critique the anthropomorphic. A latent anthropocentrism would seem to inhabit any sculpture, including those works that we take to most strenuously under mine such associations. Some of the most compelling sculptural endeavors since the early 1990s have attempted to do exactly this by means of an uncanny or queer figuration, making ex plicit the anthropomorphism that the Minimalist artists sought to repress. The sculptures of Charles Ray, Tom Burr, and Rachel Harrison summon the body with shameless blatancy. Ray fabri cates mannequins, Harrison combines them with other forms, Burr assembles sheets of wood into shapes resembling lounging figures (Fig. 1). In the work of more conventional sculptors like 1 Tom Burr, The Poet from the Waist Up, 2005, plywood, zinc hinges, framed mirror, book and book pages, thumbtacks, 42% X 235/s X 130V4 in.

These artworks project a mournful meaningfulness, a tragic aspect of the anthropocentric. Ray, Burr, and Harrison, by contrast, explore the uncanny reaches of resemblance, the strangeness of the anthropomorphic. The figures of Ray—over sized and miniaturized, cast in fiberglass and aluminum—are unsettling and inhuman. Harrison's mannequins are lifeless and empty. Burr's supine "bodies" are so obviously figurative that whatever human associations they bring up quickly fade. Works such as these reprise Judd's critique in a seemingly opposite formal register, subverting anthropocentrism by means of resemblance. The human figure returns, utterly divested of its "humanity."11 Nonetheless, like Minimalist practice, these works are scaled to a standing body. Ray's sculptures of businesswomen tower over a viewer, while the children in his Family Romance, 1993, are the same height as the parents (Fig. 2). The tilted sections of Burr's Deep Purple, 2000, are slightly taller than we are, though not nearly so high as the Cor-ten panels of Richard Serra's destroyed Tilted Arc, whose memory Burr's work invokes. Similarly, Harrison's columnar work John Locke looms above a beholder in homage to the great philosopher (Fig. 3). As these works remind us, in order to be effective as sculpture, a sculpture must be sized for a beholder to see and to grasp. However antianthromorphic its intention, the work of art remains inescapably anthropocentric. James Meyer is the author oj Minimalism: Art and Polemics in the Sixties and the editor of several books.

Miya Elise Mizuta The ideal of feminine beauty in Japan was measured, until the twentieth century, according to clearly established stan dards, within the framework of a cultural discourse that drew on Japanese and Chinese aesthetic traditions. In the Meiji period (1868-1912), however, understanding feminine beauty became a much more complex endeavor. Before Meiji, the reputed beauty of the Japanese empress had marked the esteemed limit of all that was pleasurable to the Japanese eye. The empress had served as the supreme exam ple of feminine beauty, and she symbolized the embodiment, or personification, of beauty.1 In 1873, the widespread circu lation of the Empress Meiji's official photograph destroyed this former idealization (Fig. 1). Artistic and literary repre sentations had approximated her beauty, but the photo graph, which presented her "as is," anthropomorphized her. In doing so, the photograph destroyed the traditional repre sentational order. The empress no longer signified an im mortal unrepresentable; as an extension of the emperor, who was thought to be directly descended from the gods, she, too, was "divine." She was, instead, clearly human and infinitely representable. All the attributes of beauty could not be con ferred on one person alone, and the photograph, which exposed the illusion of the empress's peerless beauty, left in its wake the demand for a new aesthetic paradigm. The anthropomorphizing photograph of the empress did more than rupture the imaginary order for beauty that had existed prior to the modern period. With the demand placed on Japan to enter into the international community, the image of the empress was also expected to maintain a contradictory set of significations: she should embody national distinction (that is, she should be relative, contingent, and modern, as a symbol of national Japanese identity), yet exude universal appeal (be absolute, immutable, and eternal, to be accepted in the global configuration). The encounter with photography and artistic realism at 1 Empress Meiji, photograph, 1899 (photograph in the public domain)</page><page sequence="19">28 art bulletin march 2012 volume xciv number 1 2 Kaburagi Kiyokata, Konjiki yasha (Gold Demon), 1947, original for an illustration in Kuraku. Private collection (artwork © Nemoto Akio; photograph © Osaragi Jiro Memorial Museum) the turn of the twentieth century in Japan raised the question of how best to represent the empress as an icon of the nation-state and as a living model for modern Japanese women. In painting and photography, a debate was waged over whether she should be depicted in Japanese or Western dress, holding a fan or standing beside a vase of roses, and so on. The question of the empress's representation indicates how, at this juncture, the representation of feminine beauty became an urgent part of the national project. During this period, the artistic representation of women played a critical role in the Western evaluation of Japanese art, which was itself being used to appraise how Japan measured as a civi lized nation. The recognition ofjapan as an artistic country— and ofjapanese art as "fine art," as opposed to mere "craft"— was an important factor in determining how the West received Japan. As the Japanese art historian and critic Okakura Kakuzo famously remarked, "It is only art that rep resents Japan to the world."2 Beginning in the 1860s, follow ing on the era of Japonisme (the fashion for Japanese art in the West), Japanese art was largely lauded, but it was also seriously criticized for not engaging the figure of the woman as a central theme. The way in which the representation of women was perceived in the West played no small part in what was often a dismissive characterization of Japanese art as mere "decorative design," inferior to Western "fine" or "high art." Some critics went so far as to say that the Japanese did not satisfactorily express beauty in the human form, a failing that underscored, in their view, a problem with the Japanese national character. In the eyes of the Western critic, an art that did not depict beautiful women in a manner to which they were accustomed signaled a mistaken estimation of beauty. The beauty of Japanese women was thought to suffer from "self-inflicted ugliness," the effect of a deformed Japa nese aesthetics. Western critics premised their evaluation of Japanese art on Western notions of beauty, which they considered to be universal. Without regard for differing standards of beauty, those critics designated the delineation of the human figure</page><page sequence="20">NOTES FROM THE FIELD: ANTHROPOMORPHISM 29 in Japanese art, and Japanese women in particular, as ugly, "pudding-faced, greasy-haired, knock-kneed, and bandy legged little creatures." What was at stake in the representa tion of women and feminine beauty was Japan's very capacity to produce art. In response, Japanese art during this period became a woman, a beautiful woman (bijin, HA). The dis cussion of what constituted feminine beauty and aesthetic beauty in general, and how such beauty should be repre sented in traditional Japanese forms as well as in newly im ported artistic styles became the basis for a larger discussion on the fate of modern Japan and its arts. Writers, artists, scholars, journalists, critics, and politicians joined in the dis cussion, producing a national discourse on the standards of Japanese feminine beauty and its artistic representation, which laid the foundation for the dissemination of Japanese aesthetics into the world—for the entry, that is to say, of a modern Japan into world culture. The Japanese artistic es tablishment, in seeking to secure a place among industrial ized nations, promoted the image of Japan as an artistic nation, a nation of artists, through the idealized image of the material body of the beautiful woman. In engaging the West as a nation of artists, Japan allowed for the conflation of beauty, women, and art. The nation played strategically into the desire of the West—the desire for Japan as aesthetic Japan, Japan as an artistic representation—by performing an aesthetic self-production, in part through the beautiful woman incarnate. The imperialist nation hid behind this self-produced facade as it advanced militarily into other parts of Asia. At a time when defining artistic "beauty" became an in creasingly urgent part of Japan's national project, an active feminization of Japan occurred, above and beyond the regu lar designation of countries as paternal or maternal entities. In the case of Japan, its aestheticization is the result of a specific feminization rather than a maternalization. The aes thedcization of the nation was produced partly through the figure of the woman and through the myth of the Japanese woman, which imagined her as an object of art. It was by means of an anthropomorphic body, personified as feminine, that Japan interrelated with the outside world; the visible, material body of the woman-as-art constituted a new limit and perspective for the nation, and it became the unified mode of access through which Japan's position among "civilized" peo ples could be established. Capable of initiating and prolifer ating desire, Japan's presentation of itself to the world was anchored in the corporeal schema of a feminized body. The anthropomorphized nation of Japan appeared not as an inanimate artwork-object that could be colonized but as an uncolonizable human-subject, an artistic, feminized nation. In the era when the advent of photography anthropomor phized the Empress Meiji, the nation of Japan was itself anthropomorphized, inhabiting and establishing the lived time of a modern subject (Fig. 2). Miya Elise Mizuta, an independent scholar of Japanese art and literature, is managing editor of the Review of Japanese Culture and Society (Josai University). Her manuscript "Aesthetic Life: The Artistic Discourse of Beauty in Modem Japan " studies the figure of the beautiful woman in the Meiji period [Departments of Art History and East Asian Languages and Cultures, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, Calif. 90089, mizuta@usc.edu]. Notes 1. Significantly, the name that the empress took on her ascension in 1868, Haruko, was written with the Chinese characters she was literally named "Beautiful Woman." The use of the character bi (beauty, j|) in the empress's name coincides with the newly coined words bigaku (Japa nese aesthetics, Jl|^) and bijutsu (fine art, ), and one can specu late on the interrelation. 2.

Alina Payne Architecture has been a traditional—even preferred—site of anthropomorphic strategies, a locus classicus, especially in the Renaissance.1 Indeed, in about 1450, Leon Battista Al berti, the father of Renaissance theory in the visual arts, proposed the classic definition of anthropomorphism: to conceive of a building as if it were a human body, from the point of view of location of parts, their relative dimensions, their connections, and in some cases even their appearance. With this definition, Alberti clearly followed Vitruvius, whose even more familiar prescription for architectural beauty was based on the proportions of the human body, and the (per fect) geometries derived from them. Vitruvius's anthropo morphism was in fact a more specialized subcategory, better known as anthropometrism, or an anthropomorphism based on measurement, and it was iconically embedded in his fa mous image of the man in the circle and square. But he also envisaged a more mimetic moment within the analogy when he described the columnar orders as visual counterparts of specific body types, the Ionic volutes being representations of women's hairstyles, for example, or the fluting of the column shaft a reference to the folds of matronly vestments. Vitruvius's body-based architecture invited a dialogue with the figural arts that Alberti was quick to develop even further, exploring—albeit metaphorically—not only the appearance of the human form as an analogue for buildings but also its subcutaneous makeup. For him, as for generations of readers who paid heed to his work, ligaments and tendons, flesh and muscles, bones and nerves became the means by which to understand walls and columns, beams and arches, stone and brick. Yet despite this original development of the Vitruvian trope, the ideal geometries of circle and square remained the principal lens through which the anthropomorphic dimen</page><page sequence="21">30 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2012 VOLUME XCIV NUMBER 1 1 Teofilo Gallaccini, L'idea cLetta fortijicatione ad uso dell'architettura militare e dell'arte della guerra, after 1610-31/2, pen and black ink, each page S'A X 11% in. (21 X 29 cm). Biblioteca Comunale Siena, MS S.IV.2, fol. 34r (artwork in the public domain) sion of his architecture has been traditionally read. The work of Donato Bramante, Michelangelo, and Andrea Palladio, to name only a few who added their own more or less organicist or abstract twists to the Albertian definition, has been viewed in a similar manner. Ornament has been equally significant, if not more so, in carrying the anthropomorphic story. Most scholarly attention has focused on the columnar orders either as elliptical rep resentations of human body types or as humanoid formations that illustrated their carrying function literally. Yet more was at stake. Ornamental details such as the column entasis, the Ionic curved frieze, and the various column bases were thought of as representations of forces traveling through a closed structural system, producing swellings here and con tractions there. As such, they were key sites of anthropomor phic correspondence and functioned as mediators "explain ing" architecture. Ancillary ornamental forms (humanoid, zoomorphic, or simply organic) deployed across facades and roof parapets performed an equally rhetorical (and anthro pomorphic function), providing elliptical references to movement and body forms under stress. This, then, is where the center of gravity of anthropomor phism in architecture has lain. Or so I thought. However, like a background chord that holds a persistent note, or a sine curve that never entirely disappears but resurfaces periodi cally, in the seventeenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centu ries, anthropomorphism reemerges in an interestingly mu tated form. For Renaissance architects, reference to the human body was either a way to claim a link to antiquity or a way to humanize and make more accessible the abstract forms of architecture. At other times, though, the anthropo morphic interest linked architecture with newly forming dis ciplines. In the age of Galileo, for example, dilettante architect and scientist Teofilo Gallaccini (medic and professor of logic and mathematics in Siena from 1622 to 1641) embraced an an thropomorphic approach in more utilitarian work (rather than in church or palace design, where the topic is normally discussed). Military architecture was informed by perspective construction, that is, by the mathematical organization of space embedded in the viewer's eye and body but also, in creasingly, by ballistics. Here, rays of vision, surveying lines, and gunshot trajectories become one and the same, and they overlap with the layout of fortifications so closely that their walls become the very embodiment of human sight. Con scious of this slippage, Gallaccini, like others before him, represented the subliminal presence of the human element in military architecture with bizarre but eloquent body-tower and body-bastion visual analogies (Fig. 1). More original still, he turned to the human body to under stand mechanics and forces at work in structures that the eye could not see but only imagine. The matematica media, which he also called matematica anatomica, allowed him to explore the folding of upright organic bodies (such as of humans or birds) in order to deduce the sequence of angles that pro duce equilibrium and apply them to construction. Interested in ship and fortification design as well as architecture, he turned once again to the human body to visualize forces and joints and, through them, to understand basic engineering. This is not classic anthropomorphism, to be sure, but it is a way of thinking about building in human terms, of processing the challenges set by the emerging Galilean physics. In some respects, the situation does not appear much different in the mid-nineteenth century. Writing in the 1870s, philosopher of technology Ernst Kapp turned to anthropol ogy and psychology to bring the alien forms of steel and iron produced by a buoyant industrial world closer to the body. Iron trusses, wire cables, and sundry tools are presented by him as so many "organ projections"—a form of elliptical mimesis or translation of the operation of man's organs (such as the arm or the nervous system) into everything it produces, however distant the resemblance to its bodily ref erent might be. Anthropomorphism here goes even one level deeper than Alberti's: Kapp sees the bone material and its very weave lying at the origin of steel trusses, and he reads the composite wire cables as an unself-conscious projection of the nerve bundles that make up the human nervous system. Whether he knew of Kapp or not, Le Corbusier returned to</page><page sequence="22">NOTES FROM THE FIELD: ANTHROPOMORPHISM this analogy half a century later. In a striking recall of Alber ti's animation theory (of tools as organic members), Le Cor busier characterized the objects of daily use—the equipment of architecture—as "limb-objects," prosthetic devices at tached to human bodies, which extend their gestures and offer so many haptic bridges to the containers within which they live. From tools to spaces, it is but one step. If Walter Benjamin pejoratively described the bourgeois man as an Etuimensch, cocooned inside his house like a pen comfortably embedded and isolated inside its case {etui), or like a mollusk carrying its home on its back, Le Corbusier turned to the same metaphor (if not anthropomorphic, at least zoomor phic) to define the nomadic life of the metropolitan man. For him, modern man had attained the mobility of the snail due to the portability of his chattels. The Villa Savoie is not portable, to be sure, but it certainly conveys the idea of a permanent state of impermanence, of movement only briefly arrested, like the overstuffed "grand comfort" chairs lifted on their thin pilotis-like legs. Anatomy explicating mechanics and engineering, psychol ogy and anthropology making sense of industrial products, empathy theory and medical technology justifying the emp tied, possessionless modernist house—each is a moment of major shift in the architectural episteme, and it would seem that each turns to the human body to find its footing. Far from being the characteristic of the Renaissance, the period icity of the phenomenon suggests that the turn to anthropo morphism occurs at times of stress and crisis, as a way to understand, unpack, and domesticate ideas and forms that pose significant challenges—a reassuring and perhaps inevi table way to get closer, bodily, to what otherwise might remain disturbingly alien.
