For me to make critical comments on Sri Lanka's cultural policy is more complicated. Policy is one thing and its implementation another. Cultural aims, like other government plans, look impressive in print but do not necessarily reflect realities. Moreover, Bandara's study was completed before the world economic situation demanded that developing countries, such as Sri Lanka, devote the bulk of their financial resources to feeding their people. In former years Ceylonese involved with the arts would have been surprised to know that a government cultural policy existed; today one reads about the 'policy' as described by Bandara and recognizes that, ill- implemented as it was, the situation in 1974 can only be worse. Disheartening to those who respect tradition is the erosion of the natural good taste of a people when it encounters an alien culture. The same unhappy results accompany 'development' in Sri Lanka as elsewhere: the primary objective of the arts and crafts becomes the tourist market; an upward-mobile populace apes the cliches of last generation's Western architecture and interior decora- tion; vulgarity and conspicuous display replace realistic desires when money and consumerism become goals. It may be true that Westernization is inevitable and that money is required to foster culture; however, I believe that a strong cultural policy, implemented without expenditure at a local level, could go far to counteract some of the atrocities of aesthetics that one notices today. For ex- ample, in the town where I live: (a) the Kandy Art Asso- ciation should produce, as was originally intended, only traditional Kandyan art and craft objects, refusing to sell, for example, harem-scene paintings on Rigifoam and table legs imitating elephants' trunks; (b) motorcar races should not take place in front of the most sacred temple in Ceylon; (c) the carnival accompanying the Kandy Perahera should not become more important than the procession itself; (d) loudspeaker music, now generally used for domestic and civic occasions, should be controlled; (e) especially in a hill town, tin or asbestos roofs, which give the appearance of a shanty town, should be prohibited and (f) Kandyan dancing should not be modified to suit the schedules of tourists. On a national scale, it is an outrage that visitors are still allowed to take antiques out of the country, in spite of a cultural policy that forbids this. Literary prizes and new civic auditoriums may have to be postponed for the present; the paper shortage indicates that book production will remain inadequate. In little ways, however, as suggested above, a people's taste can be guided at no expense by policies sensitive to local traditions. However, Ceylonese affairs are characteristically heavily politicized and until appointments to cultural posts become motivated more by cultural than political considerations, one cannot expect the current situation to improve.

The title of Tormey's book is misleading, suggesting a work of much larger scope. As the preface indicates, Tormey is not writing a history, nor even an exploration of all contemporary uses of the concept of expression. His real concern is to differentiate expressiveness from expression; for his conclusion is that works of art are not expressions at all but are 'ambiguously self-expressive'. Tormey elaborates a comparative model. A work of art is analogous to a person. Expression, he says, when states of Unesco.

Cultural Policy in the Federal Republic of Germany. 1973. 53 pp., illus. Reviewed by Gerhard Charles Rump* The monograph has the following headings: Culture and the State; Institutions and Instruments; Cultural Sectors; Training for Artists and Art Teachers; and Art Education. In the chapters are described the various institutions, activities and governmental regulations that form part of what is termed 'Cultural Policy'. Thus, the book is a useful companion to Federal German cultural policy and by reading through the pages one obtains an overall view of the subject. One cannot expect here a critical analysis of the nation's cultural policy and one does not find it. In Federal Germany, freedom of the arts is a constitu- tional guarantee, as 'after the bigotry and mediocrity of National Socialist State policy on the arts, the main aim after 1945 was to ensure a neutral and liberal attitude on the part of the State' (p. 11). The State cannot interfere in artistic life by imposing prohibitions or other regulations or interfere with styles of individual artists. (The study bluntly overlooks the part played by penal and civil codes, which are misused from time to'time against individual artists and art works, mainly because of alleged 'obscenity' but more recently on political grounds; examples are the Staeck-trials and the dismissal of Beuys from the Diissel- dorf Academy.) The official neutrality of the State towards the arts does not result in a complete disengagement in cultural matters. It is a widespread view that public art and cultural pro- motion are essential. The relevant activities in this field are listed in the book and the list is a useful guide to official cultural policies, however the book does not provide insights into their fine structure. Cultural Policy in Iran. Djamchid Behnam. 46 pp., illus. Reviewed by Fazlollah Reza** The author begins with a historical review of the origins of the different forms of Iranian culture and their evolution under foreign influence. He then embarks on the main subject by first discussing the organization of the Ministry of Culture and Art and its affiliated groups. No mention is made of secondary schools, universities and the Ministry of Education. Archeological and ethnological research, the conservation of ancient monuments, manuscripts and language, the various media for the diffusion of culture and the teaching of art are discussed briefly in succeeding chapters. In conclusion, the author expresses his views on Iran's cultural policy as regards how leisure time should be used and the impact of Occidental art upon the policy. The appendix contains material on the coordination of cultural activities and an organization chart of the Ministry of Culture and Art. Cultural Policy in Sri Lanka. H. H.

Only intentional states are subject to expression. These states are characterized by their 'aboutness', which is indicated by the use of prepositional locutions. The intentional state of a person is partially constituted by the varieties of behavior, linguistic and nonlinguistic, in terms of which it is appropriately ex- pressed; and, likewise in the case of works of art, the global expressiveness that is ascribed to them is a resultant, constituted by such nonexpressive properties as pitch, color, shape, balance and contrast, which they also possess. The expressive properties of a work of art are 'revealed' through the 'presentation' of nonexpressive properties. Tormey's analysis of expression-expressiveness identifies him squarely in the tradition of Anglo-American Ordinary Language philosophy, a school whose forte is largely critical, rather than constructive. The butt of Tormey's criticism is the classical 'expression theory' of art, whose defenders, ranging from Collingwood to Ducasse to Dewey, agree, with some variations, that a work of art is an 'embodiment' of a feeling or experience undergone by an artist and 'put there' by him. As Arthur Danto says in the introduction to the book, expression theorists hold that works of art are the 'exudates' of souls. Tormey rejects this view both as a theory of art and as an adequate explanation of what expression is. His book makes a small contribution to the replacement of tradi- tional expression theory. He offers a model: Expression Expressiveness Person as Work of art and he makes some moves in the direction of exploring the systemic implications of that model. The logic of expressiveness must have some analogues with the logic of expression. But there are also differences, and above all, they are causally independent of one another. But Tormey does not plumb the depths of his own model-a pity, for it is an interesting one. What further insights into art or, for that matter, into persons, might be derived from this analogy ? Both the products of an act of creation, they leave the hand of their maker, existentially unique, to be shaped and completed by their own interaction with the world to whose shaping they also contribute. Both persons and works of art lead a life of their own, inde- pendent of the predestination of the shaping author. Both have the capacity to elicit love, to be companions and to impose obligations, to reward cherishing and to submit to exploitation. To explore such parallels would surely go beyond the rigid restrictions to which Tormey has confined his study but it might render the book a richer source of insight to artists, teachers and nonphilosophers to whom the logic of expression is less challenging than is the practice of it. To critics Tormey offers the encouragement that, while the expressive properties of a work of art are revealed by way of the nonexpressive ones, the mediation is a non- mechanical one. The inherent ambiguity of works of art is, in fact, so rich that no single expressive constellation is exclusively warranted by a given set of nonexpressive features and hence a wide latitude of critical disagreement is permissable and welcome. Beyond this, Tormey proposes no practical counsel to artists and teachers, no guide to art historians and appre- ciators, no general theory of art. Those who will be most delighted by Tormey's book are the philosophers and logicians whose experience of the arts, as well as that of persons, tends to be predominantly indirect. By contrast, Sircello's study is much more generous in scope, both in the range of modalities of expression that the author explores and in the expanse of the philosophical and cultural tradition from which he draws. As a con- sequence, the book is less restrictively an analysis of a neatly delineated aesthetic 'problem' but is rather an alternative route to the study of fundamental philosophy. As Sircello announces in the preface, the study of the concepts of expression moved him centripetally from the aesthetic periphery of philosophy to its core. In modern terms that core has been designated the 'philosophy of mind' but the book may be understood more traditionally as a work in such categories as metaphysics, epistemology or ethics. And those passages that are most speculative- e.g., those exploring the nature of formal causality or of the self-are among the most provocative. Like Tormey, but less categorically, Sircello rejects the classic expression theory of art (Dewey, Ducasse, Langer et al.). But he is also critical of the modern detractors of that theory, among whose number Tormey must also be counted. Sircello groups these critics together as holding the 'Canonical Position', canonized by John Hospers, with Beardsley and Bowsma as its spokesmen. According to these philosophers, expression is present in art only inasmuch as certain anthropomorphic qualities-sadness, gaiety, delicacy and the like-are attributed to it by the application of a peculiar logic. Sircello finds this view simpleminded and inadequate. The bulk of his book is concerned with elaborating and displaying the varieties of things that may be expressed by way of a rich assortment of modes of expression. Art is surely one of the most effective and rewarding of these modes but scientific treatises, style of dress and deportment, as well as work and play, are also ways of expressing ideas, global emotive qualities and objective properties of the world, and even means to the expression of self, a notion that Sircello discusses briefly and rather crudely in the final chapter. Despite the breadth of his purview, Sircello is analytic- ally precise. He examines with painstaking care the niceties of resemblance and discrimination between expression and showing, revealing and making manifest, being a sign or a symptom, being an expression of F, or of someone's F, and a host of other detailed points of comparison. These examinations are relieved of their potential tedium and pedantry by their delightfully original illustrations. One can imagine the author chortling with friends and colleagues over the complex fantasies that his labyrinthine mind has invented. The book as a whole is a pleasure to read. More than a compendium of analytical insights, it is a sustained argument in defense of a single thesis, which is stated, reiterated and qualified with loving attention to clarity, distinctness and completeness. Sircello identifies his position as 'romantic', even as 'outrageous', but it is reservedly so, for he repudiates any form of mystery- mongering or sentimentalizing of private, inaccessible states of interiority. Sircello's romanticism lies in the belief that the mind is creative, not merely reflective. In so far as anything is expressible, he says-a person's attitude, feeling, mood, belief or whatever-it shows as a characteristic pattern of the behavior (including artistic acts) of that person and it is causally efficacious in pro- ducing that behavior which is its expression. Because the book itself is the expression of a full-bodied and humane intelligence, it should reward the study not only of philosophers, to whom, like Tormey's book, it is chiefly addressed but also of critics, teachers and practising artists.
