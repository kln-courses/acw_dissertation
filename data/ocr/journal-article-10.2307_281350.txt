<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTES River Style, was divided into four periods by W. W. Newcomb based upon superimposition. This style is characterized best by large anthropomorphic figures, often referred to as shamans, who hold atlatls, pouches, throwing sticks, etc. While it is noted that there are no similar figures in the rock art of nearby areas, some of these figures bear resemblance to those from Barrier Canyon, Utah, as noted by Schaafsma (The Rock Art of Utah, 1971). The later Red Monochrome Style is marked by human figures carrying bows and arrows. Human figures in this style appear more realistic and less surrealistic than those of the Pecos River Style. The Red Linear Style, of limited distribution, consists of small paintings of humans and animals. Historic- period pictographs portray horses, churches, etc. Ex- cellent color and black and white photographs by Jim Zintgraff in this chapter and others enhance the book, however, it would be helpful to have a scale in the photos. Painted and engraved pebbles are also part of the art of the Lower Pecos. These occur in deposits that date ca. 8500 to 550 B.P. Analyses of these pebbles by Mark Parsons showed that all shared three basic elements and could be grouped into six styles. Early styles 1-4 seem to be quite geometric, but in styles 5 and 6 the pebble designs appear to represent human faces. Detailed discussions of rock art by other contributors follow. Terence Grieder discusses methods for record- ing, dating, and interpreting pictographs. Solveig Tur- pin adds more data on the Red Monochrome and later styles of pictographs. To attempt to understand how the art might have functioned in the Lower Pecos, Shafer includes a de- scription of Bushman art in southern Africa and the rock art of Australian Aborigines. More detailed dis- cussion of Bushman paintings is presented by Megan Biesele, who notes the recent interpretations of the paintings by Lewis-Williams as depictions of trance states and soul transformations. A good discussion of Australian rock art by Richard Gould shows how the paintings reflect Aboriginal culture. This art contrasts with that of the Lower Pecos, which Gould sees as more variable and expressive than that of Australia. He sug- gests the Lower Pecos was a more affluent environment that allowed more individual variation in the art. A good discussion of shamanism by Peter Furst pro- vides information on the role of hallucinogens and ecstatic trances in religion. He notes the possibility that some of the paintings may represent images seen by people who had ingested mescal beans, Sophora se- cundiflora. Furst's description of the shamanic ecstatic experience is similar to the trance state described by Lewis-Williams for Bushman paintings. The book concludes with a note on the destruction of archaeological sites and a short history of archaeo- logical work in the Lower Pecos. All in all, it is an excellent introduction to the archaeology of the Lower Pecos River. While more detailed discussions of the rock art are present in The Rock Art of the Texas In- dians (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967) and in site re- ports, Ancient Texans provides a very readable syn- thesis of the archaeology which can be enjoyed by both the general public and professional archaeologists. Jumano and Patarabueye Relations at La Junta de los Rios. J. CHARLES KELLEY, with forward by JOHN D. SPETH. Anthropological Papers No. 77. Mu- seum of Anthropology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 1986. xvii + 180 pp., illustrations, plates, biblio. $10.00 (paper). Reviewed by Harry J. Shafer, Texas A&amp;M University. The area west of the Pecos River in Trans-Pecos Texas and adjacent portions of Coahuila and Chihua- hua, Mexico, constitutes one of the least known ar- chaeological regions in North America. Few major ar- chaeological studies have been carried out in the southern Trans-Pecos area despite the visibility and preservation of archaeological materials, conditions which usually attract researchers. Most of the work was carried out over 45 years ago. One was a pioneering effort in geoarchaeology that examined the association of archaeological materials with geological deposits and provided an important step forward in developing a chronology for the region (Kelley et al., TheAssociation of Archaeological Materials with Geological Deposits in the Big Bend Region of Texas, 1940). Another was the research in the La Junta district by J. Charles Kelley which is the subject of this volume. The monograph is Kelley's dissertation submitted at Harvard in 1947 and published essentially without revision, and despite the outdated archaeological interpretations, it repre- sents one of the most important archaeological studies of Trans-Pecos Texas. Archaeologically, the La Junta district is part of a broad, arid intermontane area that stretches from cen- tral Texas to Oaxaca. Characterizing the earlier ar- chaeological assemblages are those of an Archaic ad- aptation that spanned some 9,000 years of prehistory in northern Mexico and southwest Texas (Shafer, An- cient Texans: Art and Lifeway Along the Lower Pecos, 1986). This Archaic adaptation gave rise to complex civilizations in Mesoamerica, but the northern frontier remained little changed throughout the long cultural sequence. Some of these groups in the La Junta district became marginal agriculturists sometime after the be- ginning of the Christian era (Griffen, Culture Change and Shifting Populations in Central Northern Mexico, 1969); the hunting and gathering life style of other groups essentially remained unchanged. The degree to which the La Junta groups took to agriculture is a mat- ter of debate, but they can certainly be described as marginal southwestern farmers when Espejo first en- countered them in 1582; Cabeza de Vaca may have visited them as early as 1535. La Junta lies in narrow, deeply entrenched valleys of the Rio Grande and Rio Conchos surrounded by arid hills and mountains of the Chihuahuan desert, and some 300 miles southwest of the bison herds of the southern High Plains. La Junta archaeology involves a study of Chihuahuan desert Archaic adaptation, mar- ginal agriculture along the rivers, and bison hunting. Kelley addresses all three issues, which is one reason why this work is so important. Furthermore, some of the archaeological sites recorded and studied by Kelley are no longer available for archaeological research. 207</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY The volume synthesizes Jumano and Patarabueye ethnohistory and archaeology. The author compiled a detailed ethnohistorical account by using both histor- ical documents and archaeological investigations. Ju- mano, a term commonly used to refer to all rayados (painted or tatooed) Indians, was used by Kelley to refer to a nebulous group of Indians in the southern High Plains and Trans-Pecos area. Kelley acknowl- edges the problem of defining the Jumano as a separate cultural entity, but by sorting through the historical archives was able to isolate groups of nomadic hunters who seemed to have had some ethnic consistency. The separation of the Jumano and Patarabueye into distinct groups by Kelley is an interpretation that contrasts to that of Newcomb (Indians of Texas, 1961) who groups the Jumano and Patarabueye together at La Junta. Kel- ley traces Jumanos history from 1535 to 1771 and Patarabueyes history from 1535 to 1800. Kelley provides good archaeological documentation of the La Junta pueblos with which he identifies the Patarabueyes. These data are from Kelley's own field research in the area conducted in the 1930s. Using the Midwestern Taxonomic System, Kelley defines three foci- La Junta, Concepcion, and Conchos of the Braz- os Valley aspect. The earliest is the La Junta focus, dating from A.D. 1200 to 1400 followed by the Con- cepcion focus, dating from 1400 to 1700, and the Con- chos focus, from 1700 to beyond 1800. The Conchos focus shows a strong admixture of Spanish colonial artifacts. The La Junta assemblage is related to the desert Mogollon of the El Paso and northern Chihua- hua area. The ceramic assemblage of the Concepcion focus is distinctively local, but evolved out of the Mo- gollon and northern Chihuahua traditions. This archaeological documentation of the La Junta pueblos, while lacking in moder thoroughness, is sound and generally supports Kelley's hypothesized Patara- bueye cultural identity. Less convincing, however, are the archaeological assemblages that he associates with the Jumano and other ethnic groups. The reader of this monograph must realize that Kelley's interpretations were drawn from work done in the pioneering days of Texas archaeology and that they bear little resemblance to the archaeological assemblages and ethnic associa- tions of the Late Prehistoric and Historic periods as they are now understood. For example, his descriptions of the Austin and Toyah foci (now referred to as phases, see Prewitt, Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society 52:65-89) are outdated and essentially incorrect. We know now that the Austin phase material preceded the Toyah phase and cannot be associated with the Ton- kawa Indians. Furthermore, identifying ethnic groups on the basis of slim material evidence is risky indeed. However, this reviewer cannot fault Kelley for his hy- pothesized model of Jumano material culture deduced from historical records; the main problem is that the Late Prehistoric period of Texas (A.D. 1250-1600) was far more complex than when Kelley viewed it. Recent archaeological work only has begun to document the rather dramatic affect that the bison influx had on the Late Prehistoric indigenous hunting and gathering groups over much of Texas. The shift toward oppor- tunistic exploitation of bison resulted in contempo- raneous Late Prehistoric archaeological assemblages spread over much of the state that display a vague material sameness, including pointed-stem arrow points, end scrapers, flake awls or drills, and beveled knives. This broad assemblage is essentially what Kel- ley identified as Jumano and represents a major weak- ness in his theory about their mobility. Jumano travels are chronicled in Spanish archives and are traced by Kelley. These movements, however, were set into motion by Spanish interruption of native Indian cultures. The Spanish brought about sweeping changes in northern Mexican and Texas Indian groups both by acculturation and magnetism of the Spanish Colonial missions and by Spanish exploitation of the Indians themselves. Not the least important was the introduction of the horse into Jumano culture which greatly enhanced their mobility. It was the chronicled travels of one Jumano leader, Juan Sabeata, that Kelley (American Anthropologist 57:981-995) used as his ex- ample of Jumano mobility and cultural diffusion among the Indians of early Texas history. I seriously doubt that this pattern of mobility and diffusion was char- acteristic of the Late Prehistoric Jumano, although pre- horse movement to and from the buffalo plains from La Junta is documented convincingly. The historic mo- bility undoubtedly was accelerated by acquisition of the horse and the dynamics of the times stirred by Spanish Colonial activities. The major shortcomings of this volume are the out- dated archaeological interpretations. Regardless, the publication makes available a major contribution to Trans-Pecos archaeology in general and to the study of the symbiotic relationships between hunters and gatherers of the mountains and plains and pueblo farmers specifically as John D. Speth notes in the Fore- word. While aspects of Kelley's research are available elsewhere, many archaeologists will find this an im- portant archaeological and historical study. The mono- graph also provides a synthesis of the data and proposes a testable model that needs to be followed up by new field and archival research. Lithic Studies Among the Contemporary Highland Maya. BRIAN HAYDEN, editor. University of Ar- izona Press, Tucson, 1987. xii + 387 pp., index. $35.00 (cloth). Reviewed by Richard A. Gould, Brown University. During a month-long visit to a series of Kekchi Maya villages in the Alta Verapaz of Guatemala in 1968, this reviewer was impressed by the ethnoarchaeological po- tential of the Maya highlands. While I did not pursue this at the time, I am pleased to see the results of long- term and systematic ethnoarchaeological research pre- sented in this volume. This book represents a signifi- cant addition to the corpus of findings in ethnoar- chaeology and should be read closely by anyone interested either in contemporary Maya ethnology or in lithic technology. What is especially significant is the empirical treatment of variables affecting a wide range of human behavior in relation to the procure- 208 [Vol. 54, No. 1, 1989]</page></plain_text>
