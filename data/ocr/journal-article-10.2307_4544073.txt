FORTY years ago a somewhat lively controversy was being waged as to the exact significance of the term " force " in physical science. Some physicists, notably in this country Tait, of Edinburgh, maintained that there was no such objective reality as " force," that the term " force " was merely a convenient name for express- ing a certain rate of change, the rate of change of momentum, understanding by " momentum " the product of the mass moving into the velocity with which it moves. "Force" ought no more: to be regarded as an actual fact than the bank rate of interest (be it two, three or four per cent.) ought to be looked upon as a sum of money, or than the birth-rate of a country ought to' be looked upon as the actual group of children born in a year.* That the protest which this contention embodied had a certain measure of justification may be at once conceded. The way in which the term " force " had come to be employed in physical science was no less a scandal than the way in which the term. " faculty," against which Locke inveighed, had come to be' * Nature, vol. xiv, p. 459 8qq., and Recent Advances in Physical Science, p. 338 sqq. I1</page><page sequence="2">78 G. DAWES HICKS. employed in psychology. "Accelerating force," "centrifugal force," "polarizing force," " vital force," and a host of others, were freely spoken of as though they were substantive powers, perforiming functions in the world similar to those performed by the spirits and deities of primitive cultures. Too frequently it had become the fashion to fall back upon these occult agencies for explanation of natural events when other explanation failed- a mode of procedure which reached perhaps its culmination in Herbert Spencer's First Principles, where " Force " appears as " the ultimate of ultimates "-a sort of almighty potentate, directing from without the affairs of the universe. Nevertheless, I doubt whether it has ever been possible for the physicist to adhere consistently to the use of the term " force " as signifying " the rate of change of momentum " or " the rate of doing work per unit of length." Tait himself did not succeed in doing so. While insisting with peculiar vehemence upon the definition just quoted, he is constantly to be found making use of the term in the very sense which he deprecates. Following Newton, he attributes to " force " any change whether in the direction or in the rate of motion of a body. He asserts that " the longer a given force acts the greater will be the change of momentum which it produces," and in reference to " a certain force acting through a certain distance," he speaks of the possi- bility of calculating how much work it will do. That is to say, within the compass of a few pages " force " is declared, on the one hand, to be the agent which does work, or changes the rate of motion,* and, on the other hand, to be the rate at which some * Cf. Thomson and Tait's Natural Philosophy, vol. i, ? 183. " Force is any cause which tends to alter a body's natural state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line." Force, it is said, " is wholly expended in the Action it produces," and " may be of divers kinds, as pressure, or gravity, or friction, or any of the attractive or repulsive actions of electricity, magnetism, etc." And agfain (? 185), "the measure of a force is the quantity of motion it produces in unit of time."</page><page sequence="3">THE DYNAMIC ASPECT OF NATURE. 79 other agent does the work or changes the rate of motion. It is little short of nonsense to plead in excuse that in the former case the term " force " is merely a convenient symbol employed to shorten what would otherwise be a cumbrous mode of expression. As an affair of terminology it matters not at all whether the term be used in the one sense or in the other. What does matter is that if the latter usage be adopted it shall not be assumed that the reality of that which had been denoted by the former has been thereby disposed of. No gain to accuracy, the sine quda non, as Tait affirms, of all science, can accrue by confusing that which is measured with a way of measuring it. In point of fact Dr. Broad is, I think, clearly right in denying that anyone " ever does mean, or ever has meant, by ' force' rate of change of momentum."* No doubt the perceptive experience from which the scientific concept of " force " was originally derived can be safely said to be the familiar experience of the initiation of movement by us as living beings. The primitive representation of such a situation is crudely anthropo- morphic; the ageficy is taken to be the agency of the conscious subject. By degrees, however, what may fairly enough be called the mechanical side of the transaction is distinguished from the subjective aspect. The latter comes to be regarded as that in which intention or purpose is prevailingly manifested, while the former comes to be closely connected with bodily effort, the change produced being vaguely thought of as the overcoming of resistance by muscular energy. On the strength of considerations such as these Professor Tait contended, as so many others have done, that the experience of strain or tension is purely a subjective phenomenon, that we have no warrant for supposing that strain or tension is a real property of physical nature. To vision the universe appears to be filled with light and colour, although reason, as he thought, * Scientific Thought, p. 162.</page><page sequence="4">80 G. DAWES HICKS. convinces us that what we understand by brightness, etc., does not exist outside our minds, that the sensation of colour is sub- jective, the only difference possible between different so-called rays of light outside the eye being simply in the extent, form and rapidity of the vibrations of the luminiferous medium. In like manner, so he would have us conclude, when the muscular sense induces us to believe that the body is exerting power, as in pushing and pulling, or when we resist the impetus of a gust of wind, we ought to guard ourselves from the anthropomorphism of attributing the strain or tension wvhich we feel to the external world. When the earth attracts, as we say, a stone, it cannot be conscious of exerting effort, nor can the stone be conscious of being pulled. So far as secondary qualities are concernled I have tried to show on more than one occasion* that the doctrine which this distinguished scientist accepted as indisputable will not bear the test of critical scrutiny. I have tried to show, further, that a perfectly intelligible and coherent account of the process of perception can be given when colours, sounds, etc., are regarded as characteristics of natural objects, and that strong reasons can, in fact, be furnished for holding that they are characteristics of natural objects. If they are, then obviously the analogy which Professor Tait sought to constitute makes for a conclusion very different from that which he, in common with numerous other writers, would have us draw. He committed, it seems to me, the fallacy of assuming that because vibratory motions give rise to, or condition, our acts of perceiving colours and sounds, these vibratory motions must be the equivalents in the external world of the colours or sounds which we perceive. But that does not follow-not, at least, until the possibility has been ruled out that both vibratory motions and sense-qualities may be comprised in a natural object, the former conditioning the occurrence of * See e.g., Proceedings, N.S., vol. xvii, p. 318 sqq., and p. 434 sqq.</page><page sequence="5">THE DYNAMIC ASPECT OF NATURE. 81 the act of perception, the latter forming part of the content perceived. And what I am desirous first of all of maintaining on the present occasion is that, because we become aware of strain or tension through muscular sensibility, it likewise does not follow that the strain or tension of which we are aware must be suLbjective in character. Let me dwell for a moment upon the analogy to which I have been alluding. As it is requisite to distinguish the act of perceiving a colour from the colour perceived, so it is requisite to distinguish the act of perceiving a strain from the strain per- ceived, or, as Dr. Broad expresses it, ourfeeling of strain from the strain which we feel. Manifestly it is absurd to identify " force " with the feeling of strain, for in no sense in which we use the term " force " can the feeling of strain be said to be a " force." But we are no more debarred on that account from maintaining that the strains which we perceive or feel are " forces," or indica- tions of " forces," than we are debarred from asserting that the content which we perceive when gazing at a certain object is blue because the act of perceiving it is not blue. Here I cannot do better than borrow Dr. Broad's illustration. Unless after the manner of Plato or Fechner we suppose the heavenly bodies to have minds or souls it is clearly ridiculous to imagine that the sun is conscious of a strain when it pulls the earth. It is ridiculous, as Dr. Broad says, not because the sun could not be exposed to a strain, but because, presuming it to have no mind, it could not be conscious of anything, and not, therefore, conscious of a strain. Consequently, there is no incongruity in describing " forces " as the sort of entities which we become aware of in and through our perception or feeling of strain or effort, nor in asserting that physical bodies, such as the sun, are influenced by and exert " force " in this sense. In other words, there is no more reason for identifying tension or strain with the conscious- ness of it than for identifying colours or sounds with the conscious-</page><page sequence="6">82 G. DAWES HICKS. ness of those colours or sounds. Not only so. Dr. Broad presses, I think successfully, the further point that on the view one is opposing it would be no less unreasonable to say that a physical body, such as the earth, is round or rotates, than to say that it is subject to the strains or stresses which are what we ordinarily mean by " forces." For the concepts which we form of roundness or of rotation are after all grounded upon the particular instances of these universals which we apprehend through means of sight and touch. Without sense-experience of round objects the meaning of the term roundness would be as completely hidden from us as the meaning of the term blueness is hidden from a man born blind. " The person wvho uses the argument about the sun not feeling strains, as an objection to the view that the feeling of strain is the sensational experience which gives a meaning to the concept of force, may," writes Dr. Broad, "be invited to consider the following parallel argument: 'How can the concept of roundness be based on our sense-perceptions of sight and touch when the earth, which can neither see nor feel, is admitted to be round ? ' " And, as he says, " the answer, of course, is that the earth has the sort of properties which we have become acquainted with by seeing aind feeling, and that it does not need to see or feel in order to have those properties." Just, then, as the earth has the properties of being round and of rotating without being conscious that it has them, so it may be subject to forces of which it is not conscious, and these forces may be the sort of entities of which we become aware in and through our perceptions or feelings of strain.* It is, in short, a gross blunder to confuse " force " with the awareness of force. I should be prepared, indeed, to carry the argument further, and to dispute altogether the legitimacy of conceiving the mind or the " self " as being either subject to strain, in the sense in which that term is used of material things, or as putting forth * Op. cit., p. 163.</page><page sequence="7">THE DYNAMIC ASPECT OF NATURE. 83 energy. The doctrine that in what is called the " will " there is to be found the prototype of what is ordinarily meant by "force," and that even in mature experience the " will " is the one and only " force " with wvhich we are immediately acquainted has long been current in certain modes of philosophizing. " In willing," we are often told, "w we feel that we are active; we are aware of exerting energy, and we know it directly." The so- called " sense of effort " is accordingly pointed to as the essential factor in volition, and this is supposed to yield the information that the " ego " is pre-eminently the seat of force, which operates upon what is contained in the realm of the " non-ego " and initiates changes therein. Nothing, it has been said, sooner brings home to one the poise and counterpoise between self and nature than the attempt to shut a door against a furious wind.* If, however, the " self " be regarded as in this sense an efficient agent there still remains the task of showing how, in that case, the conscious subject comes to be aware of itself as this agent. And not only has that task not been fulfilled, but I think we may safely predict it never will be. It has, for instance, been contended that, while it is in the act of willing that the self has existence, yet the self is cognized as a self only in so far as there is a felt opposition of the muscles to its activity. In the experience of voluntary movement, so, it appears to be thought, there is supplied a pure inner perception both of the body and of the mental agent that operates through means of the body; and, somehow, in the duality of will-force and muscular resistance, out of which self-conscious- ness is supposed to spring, the ego is revealed to itself as the originator of the act through which it becomes known.t But can a shred of evidence be furnished of our having any consciousness, even the vaguest, of a situation such as is here depicted ? Can we, indeed, form so much as an intelligible conception of the * Martineau, A Study of Religion, vol. i, p. 199. t UEuvres inedites de Maine de Biran, tome i, p. 204 sqq.</page><page sequence="8">:84 G. DAWES HICKS. activity of the self being opposed by the resistance or the organic inertia of the muscles ? In spite, however, of an assumption so extraordinary, it has to be admitted* that the contraction of the muscles is due to the stimulus of the efferent nerves, and then it is alleged that the volitiornal force acts upon the latter, although the awareness of such force only arises through the kineesthetic sensations attendant upon the muscular contraction. So that, according to this account, it turns out after all that the " sense -of effort" is no revelation of will-force, but that the supposed xevelation is, as Mr. Bradley would ha-ve said, " an intellectual construction " which may quite well evince itself as " a thorough misinterpretation " of the facts.t Or, to take a less crude mode of dealing with the matter, it has been contended that in all \voluntary activity there is, in Professor Baldwin's phraseology, 4 an earlier fiat than the will to move, and that is the fiat of attention to the particular idea of movement "; that, in truth, even in muscular exertion, the real " effort " is to be found in " attending " to the idea. Without seeking to unearth the mnysteries covered by the term " fiat," I will content myself * Ibid., p. 212. t In the present instance it is easy to show that it is a misinterpretation of the facts. De Biran argues that we come to distinguish voluntary action from instinctive or involuntary movements on account of the unique character of the kinmesthetic sensations attendant upon the former. In the case of involuntary movements, the kinesthetic sensations have a passive character which reflects the mode of their origin; in the case of voluntary movements, on the other hand, the kinmesthetic sensations take on a character of " reduplication " whereby we are enabled to be conscious of (a) the inertia of the muscles, and (b) the volitional force which causes their contraction. But (i) there is, in fact, no such difference between kinesthetic sensations in the two cases; (ii) confessedly muscular contraction comes about through nervous impulse, and if there be resistance on their part it must be to these impulses; and (iii) muscular movement is certainly taken by the conscious subject, in the great majority of cases, not to be opposed to what seems to him to be his volitional activity but to be part of it.</page><page sequence="9">THE DYNAMIC ASPECT OF NATURE. 85 with urging two considerations: (a) Apart from the circumstance -that the " feeling of effort " is not always present in voluntary .attention, careful observation has brought to light the fact that -in cases where it is present attention usually starts before the " feeling of effort " makes its appearance, and that when the process of attending attains its highest degree of efficiency the " feeling of effort " dies away. One would conclude, therefore, -that so far from being a condition of attention it is rather a con- dcomitant, more or less variable, of the process, and that it by no means belongs to its essence. (b) It is evident, I think, that the *content we are aware of in the experience described as the " feeling of effort " is composite in character. It involves certainly the -awareness of a subjective motive and the idea of an objective change to be produced. The direct experience which we may legitimately assume as lying at its basis is no doubt that which through kinaesthetic sensations we obtain of what is happening -in contracted muscles, stretched ligaments, and so on.* When -these constituents are removed, we may well inquire, with Bradley, what is left of the consciousness of effort put forth ? In short, I cannot see that the content of which in these experiences we are .aware gives us any direct information of the condition of ourselves in such awareness, for we have no more reason for thinking that -the consciousness of strain or effort is itself a condition of the strain or effort than we have for thinking that the consciousness of blue is a conditioni of blue being there in front of us.t * W. James, Collected Essays and Reviews, p. 151 sqq., and Principles of Psychology, chapter xxvi. Cf. Bergson, Essai sur les donnees, p. 16 sqq. f Cf. my paper on " The Nature of Willing " (Proceedings, N.S., svoL xiii, pp. 57-58), where I have sought to show that, from what we are able to lay down concerning the development of self-consciousness, it is readily explicable how the effort or strain of which we are conscious has come, in our mature experience, to wear for us the appearance of self- aetivity.</page><page sequence="10">86 G. DAWES HICKS. Let me not be misunderstood. Nothing could be farther from my purpose than to imply that willing is not an active process. Every state of mind, be it of the cognitive or of the conative type, is, I should agree, essentially a state of activity. None the less, it seems to me a manifest error to assimilate mental activity to that kind of activity which we ordinarily ascribe to material things, to suppose that " feeling and cog- nition operate as psychical forces which are analogous to physical forces, except that the latter involve spatial relations."* For, on the one hand, the mental life, the psychical continuant (in Dr. Johnson's phraseology), is obviously not made up, as a material body is, of discrete particles in various conditions of agitation. A rough illustration may be permissible. When a horse pulls a cart, we speak of the horse as active, as exerting force, meaning that the initiation of the cart's movement is due to the horse's pull. But we cannot point to separable entities in the stream of mental process, one of which may thus be said to act and the other to be acted upon. Psychical causality, assuming we are justified in using that expression, is at any rate causality of a kind very different from that of physical causality. And, on the other hand, the relation of the mental act to its object in no way involves that the object is exposed to any exertion of force or energy on the part of the mind. The object is neither attracted nor repelled, nor, so far as is discoverable, in any way affected, by an act of apprehension directed upon it. In volition, it is true, the mental act culminates, or may do, in the conversion of afaciendum into afacturni, but the actual conversion is effected by the bodily and other physical mechanism. In short, there is no evidence either of one mental state acting upon another mental state or of the mind acting upon matter in a manner at * W. E. Johnson, Logic, Part iii, p. 104. Cf. Proceedings, N.S., vol. x, 1910, p. 269 sqq.</page><page sequence="11">THE DYNAMIC ASPECT OF NATURE. 87 all analogous to that in which one physical entity acts, or appears to act, upon another physical entity. II. Thus far our argument has been directed to making good the position that " force " or " energy," as ordinarily understood, is invariably something of which we are conscious, and is wrongly taken to be something either inherent in or characterizing the mental life itself. But, even if this position be sound, it does not, of course, necessarily follow that what we are in such experiences conscious of is a veritable constituent, as it appears to be, of physical reality. For our apprehension is liable in various ways to error, and although we may have excluded the possibility that the error, if in this case there is one, is due to the importation of a subjective feature into the content of what we take to be the physical world, we have not excluded the possibility of our having from other reasons misinterpreted what is presented to us. I shall attempt presently to point to positive grounds for thinking that we are not in this connexion misinterpreting the facts; but, before proceeding, it will be well to say something in reference to an objection that may at this stage be pressed. "Granted that ' force ' or ' energy ' is a content cognized and not a condition of psychical existence as such, yet it may still be true," so it might be urged, " that ' force ' or ' energy,' as thus cognized, is a purely bodily phenomenon, and that except where physiological processes are in operation is not present in nature." Now, it has, no doubt, at once to be admitted that, in the experience of tension or strain, what through kinmesthetic sensations we are immediately conscious of is usually a series of happenings or occurrences in the muscles, tendons and other tissues of the body. But these are, of course, material structures, parts of a complex material system, which is in its turn a part</page><page sequence="12">88 G. DAWES HICKS. of the inmmense material system with which physical science is concerned. Those physiologists who, like Dr. Haldane, insist that the living organism is not merely a physical and chemical mechanism would not question the truth of the proposition that the contraction and relaxation of muscular tissue is due to the strains and stresses in the constituent fibres of which it is composed. Even though relaxation and contraction as they occur in living tissue are subject to guidance and control of a special kind, yet the mechanism by means of which such relaxation or contraction is effected differs, it would -be conceded, in no essential way from the mechanism of inorganic substances. Compress a liquid or a compressible solid, and you are conscious of its exerting a force of expansion which decreases as the compres- sion is allowed to decrease. Stretch between your two hands an elastic band, and you are conscious of its exerting a force of con- traction which likewise decreases as the extension is allowed to decrease. I can find no more ground for supposing that these strains and stresses are intra-organic phenomena and not properties of the things they appear to be properties of than for supposing that the movements of the things in question are not their own movements but movements of ours in respect to them. It is true that strains and stresses cannot be apprehended through the organ of sight, while movemnent can be. Yet, what of that ? While no one need be concerned to dispute the tremendous part played by vision in the building up of our knowledge, it would be attributing to it an altogether extravagant pre-eminence over the other senses to regard it as having a monopoly in revealing the characteristics of the external world. Were our experience limited to visual experienice, even though supplemented by hearing and organic sensation, the objective scene might present for us a panorama of successive appearances (though I do not think it would); but, without the experience of pressure and resistance, we should assuredly obtain no conception of either</page><page sequence="13">THE DYNAMIC ASPECT OF NATURE. 89 matter or causality. I agree with Mr. Bradley that the experience of resistance is a secondary product and that it is absurd to find in resistance the one manifestation of reality ;* but the fact that it is not the sole manifestation of reality does not prevent it from contributing its share to that manifestation. And it is, I take it, certain that visual apprehension would be a vastly less efficient mode of cognizing than it actually is had it not been developed on the basis of the experience acquired through motor and muscular sensibility. The supposition that what wve are cognizant of as " force" or " energy" is confined to organic phenomena would, it seems to me, necessitate a theory of vitalism, cruder and more unten- able than any hitherto suggested. The advocates of a " vital force " or " vital principle " have not hesitated to make use of physical and chemical explanation of physiological processes so far as they could; they have invariably taken for granted, namely, that the "forces " and " modes of energy," differentiated by the physicist, are actually operative in organic structures and account for a great number of the processes which these structures exhibit. Their contention has been that over and above these there is an autonomy of the living organism which is not physically explicable. And, consequently, they have assumed the presence in the living organism of a non-physical influence which co-ordinates, regulates and guides the chemical and physical processes. Dr. Haldane's criticism of this viewt will be suffi- ciently familiar, and I am not now concerned to discuss it. But its difficulties, already formidable, would surely be enhanced, and its unphysiological character be made at once apparent, if it were understood to imply that what we are conscious of as * Appearance and Reality, second edition, pp. 116 and 225. t See, for example, Mechanism, Life and Personality, p. 24 sqq.</page><page sequence="14">90 G. DAWES HICKS. stress and strain is, in truth, rightly attributable to " vital force" alone and wrongly extended by us to processes in the inorganic world. III. There is, of course, no direct way of proving that strain and stress as we are conscious of them are actual factors of physical nature any more than there is a direct way of proving that colours and sounds are. We can but proceed indirectly, first by showing, if we can, that other and alternative modes of explaining their presence in experience are unsatisfactory and then by attempting to show that those physical theories which either assume or are compatible with the objective realitv of these factors are on the whole more coherent and true to fact than those which are incompatible therewith. That the conception of force is not ultimately a very important one in mechanics, and that the main advantage of retaining it there is for the purpose of making general statements is no doubt true,* and is not in the least surprising. The fundamental law of mechanics, which states how masses move under the influence of given forces, is, as Professor Weyl expresses it, simply a blank schema, which acquires a concrete content only when the concept of force appearing in it is filled in by physics. " The unfortunate attempts which have been made to develop mechanics into an independent science have not," he says, " been able to help themselves out except by converting the fundamental law into * C. D. Broad, Scientific Thought, p. 167. " You may regard the laws of motion as being expressed by equations, with force on one side and rate of change of momentum on the other. You may regard the special laws of nature as being expressed by equations, with forces on one side and the special configurations, electric charges, magnetic properties, etc., of the bodies you are dealing with, on the other. Thus you might just as well express the facts by a single set of equations, directly connecting the configurations, charges, etc., with the change of momentum, and drop the mention of force altogether."</page><page sequence="15">THE DYNAMIC ASPECT OF NATURE. 91 the merely verbal statement that force signifies mass X accelera- tion."* On the other hand, in any particular sphere of physical phenomena, such as that of electrostatics, the investigator is, he urges, confronted with the fact of force, and sees how it is determined from the phase-quantities, charge and field, according to a definite law. Assuming that what we directly observe is the motion of matter, it is, he insists, only this entire network of theoretical considerations that is susceptible of experimental proof. Modern physics takes its rise, I suppose it may be said, from Faraday's striking and characteristic conception of " lines of force." Profoundly influenced by the atomic theory of Bosco- vich, Faraday's mind was imbued with the idea that the space surrounding a body was filled with what he named the " force " which that body could commulnicate to other bodies; and he ,clearly enunciated the view, upon which in recent years Professor Whitehead has so strongly insisted, that an atom is not confined to the infinitesimal portion of space where its material is supposed to be, but that it extends wherever its action extends. In his great paper " On Static Induction,"t he concentrated attention on the dielectric, the non-conducting medium surrounding electric circuits, and localized the phenomena that occurred mainly in it, not in the conductors as it had been customary to do. He pictured the space surroundinig electric and magnetic bodies as filled with "lines of force," resembling those revealed by iron filings in the presence of a magnet, each " line of force " being conceived as a closed curve that at some part of its length passed through the particular magnet or electro-magnet in question. And a " line of force " could be regarded as forming the axis of what he named a " tube of force," which was so constituted that the product of * Baum, Zeit, Materie, 4te Aufl., p. 60. t Experimental Researches, vol. i, p. 360 sqq.</page><page sequence="16">92 G. DAWES HICKS. its cross-section into the magnetic force was constant along its. entire length. There cannot be the least doubt that to Faraday at any rate these lines and tubes of force involved that stress and strain were objectively real, and as such fundamental aspects of nature. His truly epoch-making discovery of the action of magnetism upon light-rays enabled him, as he put it, to "illuminate " the lines of magnetic force. Then came later, and through the labours of nmany investi- gators, the development of the doctrine of energy, anlticipated in some measure by Faraday's reiterated belief that " the various forms under which the forces of matter are made manifest have one common origin." It was partly due to the circumstance that the steam-engine was coming into general use, and to. recognition of its value as being proportional to the work it could do-in other words, the distance through which it could move a body against a definite amount of resistance--that, in England at any rate, the term " energy " came to be substituted for the term " force " in many of the senses that Faraday had employed the latter term. Energy was defined as " the power of doing work, in whatever that power may consist," and work as a trans- ference of energy from one system to another. So soon as. potential energy (which, by the way, Helmholtz had named Spannkraft) had been distinguished from kinetic energy (first definitely by Rankine in 1853), the principle of the conservation of energy could be formulated-a principle which Clerk Maxwell declared to be " the one generalized statement which is found to be consistent with fact, not in one physical science only, but in all." While, then, Faraday, conceived of electric and magnetice forces as pervading the space surroundiing electric or magnetie bodies, Clerk Maxwell likewise conceived of eniergy, that by which the bodies in question could do work, as pervading this space, or, in some way, stored up in it. Probably he reasoned in some such wise as this. A body, we say, is acted upon by a force,</page><page sequence="17">THE DYNAMIC ASPECT OF NATURE. 93 and in consequence moves so as to acquire energy. But there is as little ground for thinking that this energy is given to it immediately, without reference to the intervening space, as there is for thinking that the force acts at a distance. If, therefore, the energy must enter from the surrounding space, the energy may quite well be in the space; and it may be assumed would have been there even though there had been no body to be acted upon. That a body is acted upon indicates, in other words, that either moving through or stored up in the space of its vicinity there is energy, ready to be imparted to it. Thus, Maxwell was led to inquire as to the amount of energy there was in the space sur- rounding electric and magnetic systems, and as to its distribution; furthermore, he was enabled to determine the relation between the quantity of energy and the force that was being exerted. Not only so. He showed how it was possible to reduce all electric and magnetic phenomena to stresses and motions of a material medium, the former being energy of the potential type, existing in the form of some sort of strain in the medium, the latter being of the kinetic type, energy of translation. In order, however, that either kind of energy should move from one body to another, or from particle to particle of the same body, it was requisite that both kinds should be present. Only when the strain of the medium had, so to speak, been relaxed could the energy be set in motion. And on investigating the rate at which the energy thus set in motion would travel in a particular case-that, namely, in which the electrical disturbances were of an alternating character-he discovered that it coincided with the rate at which light-waves travel, and was thus led to formulate the modern electromagnetic theory of light. Physicists, as Mr. Bradley would have said, know their own business, and when they insist upon the necessity, for their purpose, of distinguishing force and energy, it would be ridiculous for the philosopher to raise any question. Obviously if force is K</page><page sequence="18">94 G. DAWES HICKS. to be defined as the change of momentum of a body considered as depending upon its position relative to other bodies it is some- thing very different from that which is expressed by I MV2 (i.e., mv X v, not m x v2). Force, in this sense, is, for example, not conserved; on the contrary it is perpetually appearing and disappearing. Indeed, even when force is taken to be " that which alters the motion of a body," it is still true that it is not identical with what the physicist means by energy. Two bodies tend to move towards each other, and this tendency is spoken of as the force of attraction. If the restraining influence be modified and the tendency becomes realized, the bodies in moving towards each other acquire energy. The energy acquired is not the force alone; but the force is an ingredient of it. The motive which weighs with physicists in now endeavouring to avoid the notion of force as that which produces change of motion is not far to seek. So soon as the equivalence of energy in its different forms and the fact of its conservation had been established the temptation was strong to confuse energy with force, in the sense just mentioned, and to conceive of force as a separate existent and matter as another separate existent, each possessing the characteristic of indestructibility. But the doctrine of energy, rightly understood, had undermined a conception of that sort. In his classical essay of 1847, Helmholtz protested against the notion of force as something per se that acts on matter, and acts across space, or as something lying hidden in material bodies and ready on occasion to leap out of them. " Pure matter would," he said, " be for the rest of nature a thing of indifference, because it would never determine any change either in other matter or in our organs of sense. Pure force would be something that ought to exist and yet again ought not to exist, for the existent we call matter." In nature, he argued, neither the one nor the other of these "pure" entities is to be found; we meet there with matter and</page><page sequence="19">THE DYNAMIC ASPECT OF NATURE. 95 force only in inseparable connexion.* It is, however, one thing to repudiate the notion of force as an entity per se and quite another thing to deny that force has objective reality. We are, as Helmholtz said, acquainted with matter only through its activities, but the fact that the activities are its activities does not lessen in the least their claim to be considered real. If a distinction is to be drawn between space and that which occupies it, and no physical.theory of energy has yet contrived to advance a step except on the basis of that distinction, Helm- holtz's insistence upon both the duality and the inseparability of matter and force would seem to be incontrovertible. Any occupancy of space, be it even that of a single electron, involves, on the one hand, cohesion of the parts within the space occupied, and, on the other hand, exclusion of parts external to the space occupied. We cannot, that is to say, form any concept of an occupancy of space apart from the idea of mass. Buit cohesion between the parts of a specific occupant of space implies a mode of force--that which Newton described as vis insita and vis inertiv. Again, exclusion of parts belonging to other portions of space implies a condition of stress-what Newton described as vis impressa. So far Kant's thesis in the Metaphysische Anfangsgrinde der Naturwissenschaft is justified, namely, that matter, in order to occupy space, must be endowed with the two forces of attraction and repulsion. When, however, Kant goes on to contend that as each part of space is infinitely divisible, so also is each part of matter occupying space infinitely divisible, his argument is, I think, inconsistent with the former position. For, if the conditions of space-occupancy be those just indicated, it follows that we must come ultimately to a particle, such as at present an electron is taken to be, which is indivisible. The parts into which any portion of space may be divided are them- * Ueber die Erhaltung der Kraft (Ostwald's Klassiker), p. 4.</page><page sequence="20">96 G. DAWES HICKS. selves spaces; but the parts into which a unit occupant of space could be divided would not themselves be occupants of space, because ex hypothesi space is only occupied by their cohesion. There cannot, that is to say, be a force of attraction except between two parts at least; so that, if the force of attraction be requisite for the material occupation of space, these two parts cannot, taken severally, be material; the minimum of matter involves their togetherness. In short, the concept of force existing, as it were, in vacuo is a pseudo-concept, and cannot really be formed. And the concept of merely passive matter, although it may be formed, is, in truth, equally self-contradictory. The very coherence or consistence of matter, that which we apprehend as resistance, compels us to think of it as active and to guard against confusing its inertia with inertness. IV. This conclusion is borne out in a sufficiently striking manner by the revelations as to the nature of atomic structure which have been pouring in upon us during the past twenty years. The old Democritean atom has been relegated to the keeping of the historian more unreservedly than even Helmholtz and his contemporaries could hiave anticipated; and the chemical atoms of Dalton have now been shown to be not atoms in the strict sense at all, but complex and loose structures, each consisting of a nucleus, wherein nearly the whole mass is concentrated, and of the much lighter electrons (or, in the case of hydrogen, of one electron) circling round it. As everyone knows, the nucleus is positively charged and the electrons are negatively charged, and thus electrical attraction plays the part in this minute system that gravitation plays in the systems with which the astronomer is concerned. " Between matter, which is the atom, and non- matter, which is radiation, the electron stands," it has been said, " as the connecting link, since it forms part of the structure of</page><page sequence="21">THE DYNAMIC ASPECT OF NATURE. 97 the atom on the one hand, and by its movements in the atom gives rise to radiation on the other hand." The nucleus, with the exception of the nucleus of hydrogen (called a proton), is not, like the electron, indivisible, nor is it merely a collection of protons; there is strong evidence that it is a collection of protons and electrons. When one thinks of the incredible swiftness of the particles thrown out in radio-activity by the nucleus, one realizes what enormous dynamic agencies are concentrated therein. And when one thinks of wvhat is happening in a single undisturbed hydrogen atom, of the electron spinning round its tiny orbit at a velocity of fourteen hundred miles a second, one is surely brought fiace to face with the fact that here we have work going on which, as Sommerfeld expresses it, is of a quite different order of magnitude from that of other physical processes. If this does not mean that stress, tension, strain, etc., are real factors belonging to the innermost structure of nature, one is at a loss to understand what it can mean; to look upon it all as simply " the expression of the metrics of the world " seems to be like substituting mere formulhe for concrete actualities. I have tried to show the impossibility of conceiving of force as an independent existent, and in reference to that there is no difference of opiniion among present-day scientists. Clerk Maxwell was equally convinced in regard to any independent existence of energy. " Energy," he declared, " cannot exist except in connexion with matter," and he would, there is no doubt, have likewise affirmed the truth of the converse of this proposition. But, in recent years, an attempt has been made by an influential school of physicists to conceive of energy as the one ultimate reality of physical nature. Their contention is that the notion of a material substance has been rendered obsolete by the electron theory, that the inertia of matter has been completely superseded by the inertia of energy, that an atom, as a system of protons and electrons, possesses no</page><page sequence="22">98 G. DAWES HICKS. material but only " electromagnetic " mass. "It is," says Pro- fessor Weyl, " not the electromagnetic field that requires matter as its carrier in order to be able itself to exist, but on the contrary matter is an offspring of the field." And he tries to show that an electron may be looked upon as an " energy-knot "-that is to -say, as a region of the field for which the field-quantities and the electrical densities assume tremendously high values- which propagates itself in empty space in a manner no different from that in which a water-wave advances over the surface of the sea, that there is no " one and the same substance " of which at all times the electron is composed.* The view seems to me untenable for several reasons. In the first place, an " energy-knot " in wvhich " electrical densities " are concentrated is an excessively obscure notion, wlhich seems at any rate to suggest that we are being given back with one hand what has been taken away with the other. The very circumstance that this " energy-knot " can be pulled back by the action of the field in a way in which other parts of the field are not pulled back would appear to indicate that we have here something which is, to say the least, very different from the rest of the field. Density multiplied by volume in space gives us mass; but, then, what is this density, and how does it come to be there? In the second place, the chief argument that is relied on does not strike me as conclusive. It is argued, namely, that while the mass of a material substance would be un- changeable, it has now been proved that the mass of an electron is not unchangeable, but that it rapidly increases when the velocity of the electron approaches the velocity of light- waves. Now, the only ground for saying that the Taass of an electron changes is that when its velocity is increased the field surrounding it exerts upon it a greater pull backwards. Yet * Op. cit. p. 183-4.</page><page sequence="23">THE DYNAMIC ASPECT OF NATURE. 99 surely it might quite well do that even though the mass of the electron did remain constant, because the greater pull backwards may, as Professor Sheldon has suggested, be due simply to its increased velocity. In the third place, the positive grounds already given for holding that force is inseparably combined with matter* seem to me applicable here also. Assuming that electrons and protons are atoms in the strict sense, that is to say, are indivisible, then an electron or a proton possesses a cohesion which is not a characteristic of anything else. If it moves, it moves as a whole, and no part of it can move while leaving the rest behind. As we have seen, what we mean by a material entity is just this cohesion of parts. In the case of material aggregates chemical atoms, molecules, so-called "things "-such cohesion is relative only; the parts can be torn asunder. In the case of an atom in the strict sense, such cohesion is absolute; the parts can never be torn asunder. The parts are charged with electricity of the same kind, and should, therefore, repel one another; yet none the less they are irresolvably held together. And not only is there cohesion of parts ad intra, there is also exclusion of parts ad extra. To use again Professor Sheldon's phraseology, two electrons never fuse into one, neither do two protons; indeed, an electron never fuses with a proton, although they mutually attract each other. What explanation can be given of this behaviour if the electron or proton be regarded as pure energy and nothing else ? Waves of radiant energy pass through each otlher repeatedly; one and the same portion of the electromagnetic field may be occupied at the same time with waves moving in various directions ;t * See supra, pp. 95-6. t I am not unmindful of the fact that the problem of radiation energy is, in this connexion, thrust upon us, and that the question might be raised whether, then, it at least is not energy devoid of material substance. But if radiation energy is in the form of undulatory motion the difficulty of dispensing with some kind of material medium is notorious.</page><page sequence="24">100 G. DAWES HICKS. but electrons and protons do not pass through one another. Again, it is this exclusion of parts ad extra, no less than the co- hesion of parts ad intra, that is characteristic of material substance. In short, atomicity-discreteness-differentiates matter from the space which it occupies. " Yes," it will be objected, " but is not atomicity-discrete- ness-a determination, as we now know, of energy?" We shall be confronted, namely, with the quantum theory, according to which radiation energy is emitted, and would seem also to be absorbed, not continuously but in definite amounts. Radiation energy goes about, that is to say, in bundles or indivisible units, any one of which contains a specific store of energy, and any one of wvhich can liberate that energy and produce an effect, yet of which no fractions are possible. But there is, so far as I can judge, nothing in this discovery, when rightly interpreted, which at all conflicts with what I have been urging. For, as Professor Nicholson told us at the Reading Congress, the one indubitable fact of the quantuni theory is Planck's constant h, and this is not a constant of energy. While the theory constrains us to think of eniergy as present onily in quanta, yet the quantum depends in each case upon circumstances. That is to say, in any system containing energy there is a" " frequency," and the energy in that system is hiv (where v is the frequency), or some whole multiple of it, so that the real constant is the quotient of energy and frequency, or produict of energy and time, a constant of what is now called " action." And this "' frequency would seem to presuppose, in Professor Nicholson's phrase, "something structural." In other words, what the constant ratio between energy and frequency appears to involve is not the discontinuous nature of energy as such, but the discontinuous nature of its emission and absorption by the atoms of matter, or rather by the electrons and protons of which such atoms consist. Moreover, what has sometimes been regarded as a difficulty in the quantum</page><page sequence="25">THE DYNAMIC ASPECT OF NATURE. 101 theory-the discrepancy, namely, between the discontinuous process by which energy is emitted from the atom and the continuous process by which it is transmitted in the form of waves-would then at once disappear. The attempt to conceive of energy as dissociated from. material substance and to picture it as an entity per se appears to me invariably to lead to one of two results, either of which is in truth inconsistent with the view in question. (a) The dematerialization of matter, as it has been called, has meant in the hands of some physicists, that while energy is declared to be the fundamental reality of which at any rate we are aware, the properties which it has been customary to regard as the properties of matter have been transferred to a hypothetival all-pervading ether in which electrons and protons are supposed to be strains or vortex motions or singularities of some kind. In order that it should be capable of fulfilling its functions there has to be assigned to the ether a whole host of mutually exclusive characteristics. That it should not retard the motion of the heavenly bodies, it must behave as a fluid with a density less than the lightest gas, while in the neighbourhood of electrons it must have a density, that is truly enormous, and yet again, in order to transmit the transverse light-vibrations, its behaviour must be that of an elastic solid, endowed with extreme rigidity. Even Sir J. J. Thomson's hypothesis of a mass-producing material made up of particles all of the same kind and excessively small compared with even an electron, these particles moving with the velocity of light, and the distribution of them depending upon the number or concentration of lines of force, would seem to be an ingenious effort to re-introduce the features of which the atom has been deprived. (b) The other altermative culminates in what has been named the materialization of energy. The inertia of the electron is supposed to arise from the energy accumulated around it in the form of fields. The L</page><page sequence="26">102 G. DAWES HICKS. mass of the electron is taken to be due not to any material substratum which it does not possess, but to its own energy, which constitutes its only substantial reality. In short, energy is endowed with mass and with weight in proportion thereto and with structure; it becomes to all intents and purposes a materialized body, although matter is supposed to be dispensed with. One is reminded of a procedure of a somewhat similar kind on the part of Leibniz, who, although he insisted uponl disposing of the Cartesian notion of substance and substituting for it the concept of force, was yet constrained to bring back what he had discarded in so far as he had to recognize an element of passivity within the compass of active force itself. V. I will conclude by referring to certain consequences which have been thought to follow from the general theory of relativity. It has been maintained, namely, that if the general theory of relativity be interpreted strictly, the "forces of nature" turn out to be " illusions," and reduce to nothing more than our subjective ideas of what are really special properties of the four-dimensional continuum in which we live our lives. Briefly, the contention, as I understand it, is based on considerations such as the following. Taking first the so-called " force of gravita- tion," we are bidden, in accordance with relativity principles, to conceive of space in the vicinity of what is familiarly called " matter " as non-Euclidean in character. In other words, space in the neighbourhood of so-called material bodies is to be thought of as " warped " or " curved," although the curvature is to be conceived as curvature in a four-dimensional continuum, in which time forms the fourth dimension. Wherever there is a " warp- ing " or " curvature " of space, there is what we call " matter," and, conversely, wherever there is " matter " there is a " warping " or " curvature " of space. In the presence of " matter " there</page><page sequence="27">THE DYNAMIC ASPECT OF NATURE. 103 must always be a gravitational field, a peculiar kink or twist in space, but " matter " is rather an " outgrowth of the field " than the field a consequence of the existence of "matter." Now, according to Einstein's principle of equivalence, " a gravitational field of force at any point in space is in every way equivalent to an artificial field of force resulting from acceleration, so that no experiment can possibly distinguish between them." Hence the conclusion is drawn that " gravitational force " is a pure fiction, and what is really there is acceleration due to curva- ture inherent in the continuum. Having thus disposed of gravitational force, it was natural to extend the method to the other " forces " with which the physicist has to deal, and to make an effort to explain these as likewise illusions arising from our faulty mode of interpreting the special metrical properties of the continuum. This, in fact, is what Weyl tries to do in his brilliant and subtle work. He labours to prove that the new curvatures which would be introduced by further generalizing the notion of a continuum are sufficient to account for the properties of electromagnetic fields and electromagnetic foTces as we are acquainted with them. It is not possible to do more here than indicate in the barest manner why intellectual constructions such as these strike me as singularly unconvincing. At the conclusion of his work Weyl has to acknowledge that "the problem of matter is still wrapt in the deepest gloom"; and it can hardly, I think, have escaped notice how the writers who follow the line of thought which I have very inadequately sketched are constantly using phraseology which implies a theory of material substance such as they would explicitly reject. Thus, for example, Mr. J. H. Jeans speaks of " the path of a particle " in the continuum as being simply its " world line "; and of the curvature of path as being " thrust upon the particle by the nature of the continuum."* * Art. " Relativity," in Ency. Brit., twelfth edition, vol. xxxii, p. 266.</page><page sequence="28">104 G. DAWES HICKS. But what are we to understaned by a "particle" ? Is it a material entity of the kind we have taken electrons and atoms and complexes of them to be? If it is not, the reasoning would appear to break down; if it is, the mere fact that the particle is moving would surely constitute it into an efficient agent of the very type that is repudiated as being illusory. Or, to put the point in another way, while a " particle " is continually being treated as though it were an occupant of the continuum and moving along geodesics in it, what the view really demands is that it should be a part of the continuum, which as such cannot step, as it were, outside the continuum and move along one of its paths. But the main objection I am concerned to press is that the position I anm criticizing throws a burden upon what is described as " our subjective interpretation " which that faculty of ours, whatever it is, is wholly unable to bear. You cannot get rid of an awkward fact by the easy device of proclaiming it to be a subjective illusion. Evenl an " illusion " has a being of its own, and you are not entitled to treat it as belonging to a sort of no-man's land of which you need take no further notice. In the present instance, if the human mind invariably " interprets " changes in nature as due to the operation of forces, then, even though that irnterpretation be a misinterpretation, there must be in the objective world that which will account for the interpre- tation coming to be made and being what it is. And, on the theory before us, if it be understood literally, there is nothing in the objective world which by any conceivable manipula- tion could render such experience possible. The readiness with which the mind is supposed to be capable of creative functions when in the interests of a theory it is necessary that nature should be regarded as destitute of properties it seems to possess is certainly astonishing. For example, Mr. Jeans, in the very able article to which I have alluded, after asserting that the</page><page sequence="29">THE DYNAMIC ASPECT OF NATURE. 100 apparent "force of gravitation " arises solely from acceleration, and pointing out that acceleration results not only from changes in the amount of a velocity but from a change in its direction also, gives the following illustration to bring out his meaning: " A motor-cyclist riding in a circle at a uniform speed of 60 miles an hour will be the subject of arn acceleration towards the centre of the circle. He knows that the apparent force so produced is just as real in its effects as gravitation, and to save himself from falli'ng as a result of its influence he must incline the direction of his machine to the vertical." If, however, the " force " so produced is merely apparent (that is to say, as Mr. Jeans implies, unreal and non-existent), how is it intelligible that it canl give rise to effects so unmistakably " real" as those which are here depicted ? Certainly, confronted with a theory of this sort, a poet may be allowed to protest, "If Nature be a phantom, as thou say'st, A splendid figment and prodigious dream, To reach the real and true I'll make no haste, More than content with worlds that only seem." One of the distinctive features of Professor Whitehead's more philosophical rendering of the theory of relativity consists, I need hardly remind my readers, in his resolute rejection of the view of the non-uniform structure of the four-dimensional continuum, and his insistence upon the necessity of regarding it as. homaloidal in character.* It would, therefore, be impossible for Whitehead to acquiesce in the attempt to reduce either matter or force to subjective interpretations of the special properties of the space-time continuum. On the contrary, he expressly refuses to countenance any conception of psychic additions to * For the grounds of Whitehead's contention see The Principle of Relativity, chapters ii, iii and iv, and cf. his Address on " Uniformity and Contingency " (Proceedings, N.S., xxiii, p. 8). M</page><page sequence="30">106 G. DAWES HICKS. the objects known in perception, any antithesis between nature as it really is and experiences of it which are purelv psychological. For him our experiences of the apparent world are experiences of nature itself; there is but one nature, the nature which is before us in perceptual knowledge. And he would, I take it, agree that just as " the nature which is the fact apprehended in awareness holds within it the greenness of the trees, the song of the birds, the warmth of the sum," etc., so likewise it holds within it that which we denote by such terms as force, activity, strain, stress, tension and the like. Indeed, in his emphasis upon " passage" and " process " as the fundamental characteristics of nature, he is meaning, if I mistake not, to include under these phrases the features with which I have been concerned. I am afraid that the sharp contrast he seems to draw between " objects " and "events "' will preclude his concurring with some of the things I have been urging, but, I hope the main drift of my argument is not out of harmony with whiat he has taught us.</page></plain_text>
