The Printed Work of Carroll Dunham by Susan Tallman by Susan Tallman</page><page sequence="2">\ll Oil Pill ICI- ■+.*&gt;</page><page sequence="3">The idea that it's a mad mad world out there has been with us a long time, and it has fos tered its fair share of great art (Goya, Grosz, Guston in the Gs alone).The somewhat more dis comforting idea that it's a mad mad world in there —that it's not them, it's me—has had its masters as well (Francis Bacon, James Ensor), although these are rather fewer in number, given the difficulty of representing a psychotic misunderstanding of the world in terms that the world can understand. Both notions resonate with us because most of us feel both ways: some of the time (all right, most of the time) it's them, but at least occasionally, maybe, it might be me. This tricky and uncomfortable truth —that our sense of self is based in a kind of mud dling about between Out There and In Here—has been Carroll Dunham's subject for years. But in his recent printed work, this vision has acquired both a belligerence and a clarity that place it at a distance from his previous art, or that of anyone else, for that matter. Back in the early 1980s, when the pixilated, postmodern soul was being widely scrutinized in photography, installations, and performance art, Over the last 16 years, Dunham has produced some 60-odd printed images by one technique or another—lithography, etching, drypoint, linocut, woodcut, monoprint, digital media. "Printmaking," he says, "is part of the way I think."2 Throughout this time, the pole position in his art has rotated between painting, drawing, and printmaking. Sometimes drawing led the way, with its tap roots in the subconscious; sometimes it was painting, with its insistence on dramatic presence. But fre quently it has been printmaking because of, rather than in spite of, the medium's analytic discontinu ities and mediated surfaces. It is the combination of these elements—the psychic drama married to the careful premeditation—that makes Dunham's art so peculiar and affecting. In 1984 Dunham was part of a group of young painters who were invited to work at Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE) in West Islip, part of Bill Goldston's attempt to rejuvenate the hallowed printshop after the death of Tanya Grosman. Like most painters, Dunham began by seeking out lith ographic analogies for the methods and effects he knew from painting, an approach that quickly "Printmaking," he says, "is part of the way I think." Dunham was hailed for revitalizing the catatonic hulk of painting. His structurally elegant paintings on wood, in which autonomous genitalia sailed past fountains of spewing ooze, were wise, and funny, and complicated. They managed to speak the lan guages of Freud and of Formalism, with just a titch of Elmer Fudd. Later on in the 1990s, when identity pixilation was replaced by identity politics, Dunham was credited with the resurrection not just of painting, but of the very idea that visual imagery could be an exposition of interior emotional experience. Just when everyone had concluded that "originality" and "direct experience" were artificial constructs, there was Dunham, picturing desire and anger and despair in paintings populated by a bizarre race of toothy, eyeless creatures who snarl about, genitals akimbo, like psychotic escapees from a "Mr Men" book ("Mr. Borderline-Personality-Disorder" per haps, or "Little Miss Intricate-Orifice"). These are not clever paintings, or pretty ones, but as one crit ic has put it, they "restored painting's integrity."1 Curiously, this new painterly language, this salva tion of canvas and content, evolved not from a sin gle-minded devotion to painting but, in large part, through the making of prints. proved frustrating and, as he puts it, "undignified." He got interested, however, when he discovered characteristics of lithography that had no parallel in painting, when he saw that there were other ways things could look. His early lithographs, such as Untitled (1984—85) and Accelerator (1985), were im mediate successes—visually seductive, dynamic to the point of explosiveness, impeccably produced, serious, and entertaining. They celebrated the tac tile pleasures of lithographic materials—stones, crayons, tusche, etc.—and they exalted a layered, additive, printerly way of composing pictures. Goldston had told Dunham that lithography would "break apart" his thinking. The mechanical stages of producing a print necessitate parsing the image in non-intuitive ways: in color prints, obvi ously, the colors must be broken out onto separate plates no matter how integrated they are at con ception, but there are countless more subtle exam ples. (Each of the cascading bubbles in Accelerator, for example, had to be masked off from the others and painted individually on the stone.) At the same time, having many different pieces of an image available on many different stones and plates can be a boon, allowing the artist to play with elements— to add, subtract, change colors, change directions, 46 March-April 2001 46 March-April 2001</page><page sequence="4">(Prev ious spread) Carroll Dunham.

For Dunham, this was a logical extension of the layering, or "filling up," that he used to compose his paintings. In order to reflect "what feels true," Dunham piled many different states of mind and ways of working into each image he created: fetishistically elaborated de tails, messy splats, languid lines, all came together in a perfectly composed froth of fragmented self understanding. Familiarity, however, can breed discontent. After a while, looking around the studio at "smear A on this plate and blob B on that one," Dunham found that the business of composing through accumula tion began to feel "habitual and fuzzy"—a device for making pictures rather than a visualization of felt experience. Three years into printmaking, his paintings underwent a major transformation as "a direct result of what was happening in the prints." Fie was tired of filling up. He was also tired of the wooden panels that had been such a distinctive sub structure of his painting. The panels provided a dis tinct material presence, a geometric structure, and a way around the nerve-racking confrontation with blank canvas. Working at ULAE and at 2RC in The ten drypoints of Shadows (1989) are quick, light, shimmering, and fabulously inventive draw ings. Pages from a small catalogue of hysterical morphology, each portrays a giddily unstable shape, equal part gonads and goat horns, tubers and tumors, asteroids and sigmoid colons.3 It took just a day or two to draw each plate (Dunham describes the process of scratching a line into the pewter plate as "drawing on butter"), and the sense of direct contact between mind and hand and image is almost tangible. The portfolio Seven Places (1990—94), on the other hand, represents an almost perverse embodi ment of technical indirection.The images began life as crayon sketches, which were first blown up into lithographs, then transformed into photogravures and elaborated with soft-ground etching. The ini tial appearance of rough immediacy is quickly undone by the tactile smoothness of the page. The crumbly line can be seen but not felt, like a bright ly colored crayon drawing under ice. One of Dunhams most salient characteristics as a painter is his sensitivity to the emotional implica tions of surfaces. His eccentric use of the thin, dull Dunham learned to doodle on the face of the tabula rasa. Rome, where he made a set of etchings, Dunham learned to do without the wood—to doodle on the face of the tabula rasa. What he wanted now was a "subject"—not a narrative focus, but a shape that was visually cogent yet could accommodate the complexity of inner life. In 1988 Dunham began work on a series of gigantic etchings (they are each about six ft. long) featuring a large, central, hammer-like form. In Untitled (1988—89), it is a massive brown thing, geo logical or even paleological in feeling; in Wave (1988-90), it is a lemon-yellow, psychedelic swelling that swings round and envelops the sky; in Point of Origin (1992), it is a lava-like outburst, wet and messy and uncontrollable. Its identity was ambigu ous, but its presence was not. There were other shapes, too: a mound swelling from some invisible interior agitation; a bulbous, pointy-tipped thing; strange intestinal coilings. This was a period of intense and diverse printmaking for Dunham. In addition to large, multi-plate works, there were straightforward line etchings, lithographs, dry points, and an extraordinary woodcut. The eclecti cism was still there, but rather than piling multiple states of being into a single image, he shared them out amongst distinct objects. skin of casein in his early paintings was at least as striking as the acrobatic penises. In printmaking he became a virtuoso manipulator of the printed sur face, exploiting not just the "breaking apart" of image into component parts, but the breaking apart of image and affect. One of the things about print making is that any given picture, whether imagined or quickly jotted in a notebook, can be given a number of different guises, different affects, differ ent beings—a crayon drawing can become some thing poised and deliberate; a tiny, linear sketch can become a massive jigsaw of woodgrain and color. The power of these prints lies in the weird gap they open between the apparent content of Dunham's drawings and their physical body. In 1992 Dunham began working with Leslie Miller of Grenfell Press in New York on a set of color multi-block linocuts (Places and Things), and two years later on a number of reduction linocuts, a process Dunham accurately describes as "the most conceptually twisted there is."4 In Places and Things, brightly colored silhouettes of mounds rise and sink—flat forms adorned with flat goop and flat encrustations. The images are mesmerizingly dopey and utterly compelling—the Yellow Submarine pays a visit to Endoscopy Land.

All the quick witted doodles that had seemed so intrinsic to Dunham's art are gone, replaced by shapely swaths of hard color tied up with a licorice-black line. By the time of the reduction linocuts, Dunham's mound shape had undergone a startling transfor mation: it had squared off, sprouted floppy and expressive lips, and, most alarmingly, a dense array of not entirely friendly looking teeth. It no longer suggested geology or biology, it suggested personal ity, and the personality it suggested wasn't sunny. While such eruptions of psychologically revealing anthropomorphism might be expected in off-the cuff doodles, reduction linocut is a process in which spontaneity, improvisation, and sudden invention have no place whatsoever. It is obvious that every aspect of the image has been planned out and locked tight. Strange, yes. Accidental, no. Dunham's paintings, meanwhile, were getting seriously goofy. He had imported from linocut a simplified vocabulary of engorged forms, but now swatches of dotty patterns and globular adornments began to attach themselves to the shapes. Foam rubber balls glued to the canvas gave them an effer vescent, pustular touch. They were beginning to look contagious. This kind of protuberant physical presence is not a feature of most printmaking, since paper is usual ly flat and presses habitually make it flatter. One exception is the hydraulic process employed by David Lasry at Two Palms Press in New York, with a press capable of exerting 750 tons of pressure (the hydraulic press was invented to mold rubber at extreme temperatures). In a set of three wood en gravings, Waiting for Wood (1995—96), Dunham used the press to print woodcuts as if they were etchings, forcing thick paper down into the carved lines, molding it to the contours of a woodblock. The line sits above the depressed plane of the image like a rawhide lash. Ink-encrusted carbuncles dot the surface like fungi or suspicious new moles, decora tive and distressing in equal measure. Once again, there is a disturbing disconnection between differ ent aspects of the image: the angry baring of teeth, the cheerful colors, the jolly loop-de-loops of hair, the obvious physical exertion of its making.

Courtesy Two Palms Press, New York. effect and content is, of course, one of the classic hallmarks of madness. Madness became Dunham's overt subject in the drawings he did for an edition of The Alienist, the 1881 novella by Machado de Assis, published in 1998 by Arion Press in San Francisco. The alienist of the title is a provincial Brazilian doctor who, upon realizing that he and his wife would never have children, packs up his procreatory urges and devotes himself to the identification and catalogu ing of madness, with disastrous results for everyone concerned, not least himself. In Dunham's drawings for the book and the accompanying print portfolio, his toothy blockheads step over the line into life. No longer just subjects, they are characters. The doctor has become a tube with bared teeth and a black hat—Mad magazine aggression buttoned into a doctor's suit; figures inside the asylum are subject to all kinds of pathological morphology: hands and penises sprout from foreheads, snaky appendages writhe above hairlines, the usual bor ders between inside and outside run amok, giving way to all sorts of intricate interpenetrations of body and background. In the story, a friend of the doctor argues that "with the current definition . . . madness and sani ty are perfectly delineated. We know where one ends and the other begins. Why move the fence?"5 Dunham pictures not just the moving but the col lapse of the fence, and with it all familiar bound aries between organic and inorganic, between the body and the environment, between interior and exterior. The drawings were made with Magic Marker, then cast as relief blocks that could be printed letterpress, so they are loose in visual struc ture but curiously solid in feel. The slight indenta tion of the black line in the paper only emphasizes the essential flatness of the image. Figures don't so much sit atop a background as interlock with it. These "deformed characters," as Dunham calls them, with their multipurpose genitalia and their overdeveloped dental arrays, have become the focus of his art. In his most recent painting show, they covered the canvases, bristling with weapons, destroying planets, arguing and gesticulating, roar ing and gorging. But in his new prints, the vicious group dynamics have been pared down. These are, quite simply, portraits.

Like the overflowing pictures of the 1980s, these characters are vessels of compulsive visual invention, churning emotional drive, and bad behavior. But they are not agglom erations, they are distillations. Dunham's habitual concerns—love, hate, sex, prevarication, the pleas ures of keeping busy with your hands—are ren dered with the bare essentials: a rope-like black line and flat fields of color that are locked together in ferocious intercourse. The Deformed Characters wood engravings made at Two Palms Press last year depict hostile duets: couples with teeth bared, backs turned, brows (if that's what you call the area between lip and hair on a figure without eyes or nose) furrowed. Stove Pipe Hat (cover image), also from last year, presents a sin gle bust, penis-nosed, all poky angles and pompous chuffing. Killer is noseless but armed. Like the ear lier Two Palms prints, these were printed, from woodblocks slathered with oil paint, under huge sketch, but also the profound authority invested by the printed surface. Just as we're more likely to believe what we read in print, a printed image— particularly a masterfully printed one—carries a mantle of credibility. The investment of time is vis ible in these surfaces, whether it's the bulging mus cularity of the Two Palms prints or the seductive blushing skin of the ULAE lithos; and it makes them weightier—and weirder—than any Magic Marker sketch. They look like we often feel: caught between violent emotion and bizarrely distanced observation of that emotion. "Lithography," Dunham has said, "makes room for analysis," and the point can be extended beyond lithography to all print media. Poised between the gush of hot emotion and bloodless eloquence, that "room for analysis" is the gap in which expression and control collide. It is where Dunham has, uniquely, situated himself. His deformed characters are the result of digesting, rather than simply col lecting, contradictory states of being. Their por These characters are a kind of millennial Everyman and Every wo man. amounts of pressure. (Months after printing, they still smell like an art school hallway.) The paper is as thick as a plank and rises up above the compressed color fields. The woodgrain is not just printed onto the image but molded there. You cannot look at the images without perceiving the sheer tonnage that went into bringing them about. Therein lies their profound strangeness: they are physically repressed but psychically unleashed. And while it may seem as though you're looking at the spontaneous outpour ings of the id, there is nothing natural or sponta neous about them. They are like carefully cal ligraphed swear words—their apparent content and the manner of their making are totally at odds. For the past year, Dunham has been back at ULAE, working on several concurrent projects, including a just-completed set of 13 Female Portraits (2000). Each features a single figure joined to the space around her through wiggly interstices, like those of some intricate coastline. These are small scale lithographs, rosy in color, silken in texture, dis turbing in content. They are based on Magic Marker sketches, but the quick minutes devoted to making the drawings were followed by months of consideration and experimentation. They were scanned, colored, and resized digitally, transferred to etching plates, and when that didn't seem quite right, transferred to litho plates. The final result has the lubricated ease and unlabored line of a quick traits, freed from distracting addenda, purged of nostalgia and the soft touch of a painterly hand, are the clearest statements yet of what Dunham is about. Unflattering though it may seem, these char acters are a kind of millennial Everyman and Everywoman—a maze-like mingling of internal and external events, of them and me, tons of pres sure, dirty secrets, nice make-up.
