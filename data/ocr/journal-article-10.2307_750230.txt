<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CONFLICT OF IDEALS IN MUTIANUS RUFUS A Study in the Religious Philosophy of Northern Humanism By Lewis W. Spitz C rotus Rubeanus, upon his election as rector of the University of Erfurt in the autumn of 1520, following his return from Italy, had his coat of arms displayed surrounded by those of sixteen humanist and reformer friends.' In the four corners of the design, larger than the rest, are the shields of Luther, Erasmus, Reuchlin, and Mutianus Rufus, symbolizing their special place in the intellectual life of the day and suggesting a unity between them which was destined soon to be shattered. The study of the religious philosophy of Mutianus Rufus, the least well known of the four, holds promise for a better understanding not only of the relationship of these great historical figures, but of the nature and spiritual content of northern humanism itself. The interpretation of the northern Renaissance, lacking from the start the uniformity and comprehensiveness of the traditional view of the Italian Renaissance, nevertheless stressed in the first decades of the post-Burckhardtian period the Italian origins, the significance of the revival of antiquity, and the modernity and revolt aspect also of the philosophic and religious tenets of northern humanism. At the turn of the century revisionism was already seek- ing redress and the religious thought of northern humanism was being sought in sources indigenous to the North and more closely related to mediaeval culture. The first half of the present century has seen some progress towards a new constructive synthesis. Further advance requires sound study on the level of individual personalities who played a significant r6le in the developing world of thought.2 Towards this end a study of the intellectual development of Mutianus Rufus should be rewarding for several reasons. He himself was an important personality in the cultural life of his day, even though his own fame has not weathered the passing of the centuries so well as that of some leading humanists. He held the undisputed leadership of the Erfurt humanist circle, not unlike the Rhenish league of Celtes or the Erasmian Strasbourg league. As the key figure in the humanist movement of central Germany, he main- tained a kind of literary censorial office which extended his influence far 1 Alfred Overmann, Erfurt in zwiilf Jahr- hunderten, Erfurt, 1929, p. 201, reproduces the design from a drawing on parchment in the Erfurter Universitdtsmatrikel, II, in the Erfurt city archive.

Typical of the classic interpreta- tion of the religious concerns of humanism was Paul Wernle, Die Renaissance des Christen- tums im i6. Jahrhundert, Tiibingen, 1914, who believed not only that the religious concep- tions of Italian humanists were decisive for northern humanists, but also strongly in- fluenced Oecolampadius, Zwingli, Luther, Bucer, and Capito as well. H. Hermelink, Die religiisen Reformbestrebungen des deutschen Humanismus, Tibingen, 1907, spearheaded revision by maintaining that the humanism of northern Europe was essentially indepen- dent even of Florentine Platonism and found its sources in Biblical humanism and Catholic reform efforts. R. Wolken, Literarisches Zen- tralblattfiir Deutschland, LVIII, no. 30, p. 946, suggested important correctives to Herme- link's thesis. The most recent article on the varying interpretations is by Henry S. Lucas, "The Renaissance: a review of some views," The Catholic Historical Review, XXXV, 1950, pp. 389 ff. It adds little, however, to Wallace K. Ferguson, The Renaissance in Historical Thought, Boston, 1948, pp. 253 if. 121</page><page sequence="2">122 LEWIS W. SPITZ beyond that of his immediate personal contacts. In his own day he was highly regarded by such fellow humanists as the legist Zasius, who, although not a member of the Erfurt circle, nevertheless considered Mutian "the most learned German," a second Varro. Mutian on his part, with due respect for Zasius whom he regarded highly, thought such adulation "stupid" and said so quite plainly.' Posterity has given him fourth place after Luther, Erasmus, and Reuchlin.2 This prominence suggests that Mutian participated actively in the intellectual life of the period and will therefore serve as a useful index to the changing thought currents of the time. He is a particularly useful subject for study because in him the major conflicting sources of the religious thought of northern humanism combined or sought to combine. The product of a home environment representative of the new rising lay culture, he absorbed in turn the northern piety of the Devotio Moderna with its mystic tradition, piety, and biblicism, the late scholasticism of the via moderna predominant especially in many university centres, and the Italian religious philosophy developing particularly in Florence towards the end of the century. More- over, he was only a few miles removed from the centre of Protestant activities during the crucial initial years of the Reformation movement and was in close contact with its principal and secondary figures. Mutian's religious philosophy has been subjected to a wide variety of historical interpretations. In his own day his detractors, particularly his fellow- canons, simply labelled him an "Italian." The rabid Cochlaeus accepted this evaluation with all its implications and gave it currency in Catholic historio- graphy with some modifications down to our own day.3 Similarly, 'Luther, although he mentioned Mutian only three times after 1517, spoke of him loosely as an Epicurean.4 Following this cue, the leading Lutheran historian of the seventeenth century, Veit Ludwig von Seckendorff, in the first book of his Historia Lutheranismi, castigated him roundly for his lack of religious feeling and the secularization of Biblical narrative. The primary sources for an intimate study of Mutian's thought, his letters, were published for the first time in 17o01 by Wilhelm Tentzel.5 His edition contained only a fifth part of the total volume which has since been published but contained the Frankfurt collection of Mutian's letters to Urban including those exchanged between 1503 and I508, Mutian's most radical period. Without the corrective of the predominantly conservative letters of the later years, it is understandable that scholars using this edition in the subsequent two centuries should see Mutian 1 Carl Krause, Der Briefwechsel des Mutianus Rufus, Kassel, 1885, Letter 89, p. 99.

The very influential and often cited work of Karl Hagen which reached several editions, for example, presented a series of quotations from Mutian which served to illustrate the thesis that "he went the farthest and deepest of all into the free-thought point of view towards Christian theology."' Similarly David Strauss in his popular biography of von Hutten pictured Mutian in this light, although he suggested that Mutian made a rather dramatic return to the fold at the end of his life.2 As a result of this concatenation of circumstances writers have "ascribed to him opinions varying from pantheism to atheism."3 Kampschulte in his enthusiasm for everything related to Erfurt became Mutian's ardent apologist and declared that all his expressions must be viewed as a mistaken reaction against his un- fortunate environment.4 It has been only since the publication by Krause and Gillert of more complete source materials that a truer evaluation of Mutian's religio-philosophical position has become possible.5 Conrad Mutianus Rufus was born in Homberg, Hessia, October 15, 1471, into relatively prosperous circumstances. His father, Johann Muth, was a patrician and popular city councillor and mayor. The family fortune was adequate to afford Mutian a measure of financial independence during his travels and years at Gotha, although his unstinted hospitality and costly book purchases, especially from Aldus and Froben, steadily depleted his resources until his small stipend as canon became his sole remaining income. When this was eliminated in 1525, he was reduced to absolute poverty and depen- dence upon his friends. It is, however, perhaps not too fanciful to see in his bourgeois background the influence of the "rising lay culture." It was perhaps this which produced in Mutian that optimistic mood which prompted him to predict the advent of a new better world, an aetas superior in which ingeniosi would grow, life and light would flourish." 1 Karl Hagen, Deutschlands literarische und religidse Verhdlltnisse im Reformationszeitalter mit besonderer Riicksicht auf Willibald Pirkheimer, Erlangen, 1841. 2 David Friedrich Strauss, Ulrich von Hutten, London, 1874, PP. 22 f., 365.

SPITZ Mutian's intellectual development was conditioned during three distinct periods of formal education in Deventer, Erfurt, and Italy. At the age of ten he entered the school of the Brethren of the Common Life at Deventer. Estimates of the position of Deventer in the development of northern human- ism have varied greatly. It is clearly impossible to consider the Brethren's founder, Gerhard de Groot (d. 1384), the "father of northern humanism." Rather, the trend of recent scholarship has been to stress the mediaeval character of the Brethren.' The strong emphasis on piety was a prominent characteristic of the Devotio Moderna. The Westphalian Alexander Hegius was responsible for Deventer during the years of Mutian's studies there. Under Hegius Deventer was dedicated to Thomistic realism, and Hegius, who learned Greek and made partial concessions to humanist learning, was him- self concerned with problems of post and ante rem. Metaphysics was still the "praestantissima omnium scientiarum," high above grammar and rhetoric, alone deserving the name of wisdom. In his work directed against scepticism, the De scientia et de eo quod scitur, he argued that Aristotle was basic to a know- ledge of the res naturales and to metaphysics as well and expressly polemicized against Plato and Platonists.2 Such was the Hegius and Deventer that Mutian knew. In 1486 Mutian entered Erfurt University where he received his A.B. degree in 1488 and his M.A. degree in I492.3 The following two years he taught at the university where he was an able and popular teacher.4 The University of Erfurt, founded in 1392 as the fifth university in the Empire, was distinguished during the first century of its history by two characteristics, the anti-papal sentiment of many of its leading figures, and the adherence in the faculties of theology and philosophy to the via moderna.5 Several factors combined to accentuate the independent, anti-hierarchical tradition of the university. It was established during the great schism and sought authoriza- tion from several popes in succession, Clement VII, Urban VI, finally opening under Boniface IX, a fact not apt to benefit papal prestige at Erfurt.6 Like Cologne, it was a bourgeois foundation, controlled by the city council.

Two members of the faculty were especially widely known for their dissenting sentiments. Jacob of Jiterbock was a confirmed conciliarist, a close friend of the sensational popular preacher Geiler von Kaiserberg. The rector of the university in 1456, Johann of Wesel, a Mar- silian, after many years of criticism of abuse, received wide attention through his famous tract against indulgences on the occasion of the papal Jubilee. Jacob Wimpheling hailed him as the "Doctor saecularis." He was opposed by Heidelberg and Cologne, recanted at Mainz with the attendant burning of books. Nevertheless, Luther stated over half a century later, "Johann Wesel and his books ruled the University of Erfurt where I received my M.A." Much anti-papal feeling, however, was not overt and there was actually a great deal of external conformity on the part of the faculty as a whole. For example, on the occasions of his visitations in 1502 and 1504, Cardinal Raimund von Gunk was well received at Erfurt.x Nevertheless, the critical tone persisted and gained volume through the first decades of the sixteenth century. Much Italian humanism was severe in its attacks upon church conditions and the scholastic philosophy. It was this fact in part which has deluded some scholars into a premature discovery of humanism at Erfurt and even to conclude that the "University of Erfurt was the first in Germany to decide for humanism."2 In Erfurt the chapter school had established the studium generale long before Charles University or its own University had been founded. Moreover, the writings of Nicolas de Bibera around 1282 show that to a certain extent the classics were in use in the thirteenth century, for he cites freely from Juvenal, Terence, Horace, Plautus, and Virgil.3 But the poems of Nicolas, the Carmen satiricum, for example, were after all essentially ecclesi- astical and mediaeval.4 For at this stage of development, as at Deventer under Hegius, the attitude towards classical learning was still "utor, non frui," use, but do not enjoy it for its own sake. The more purely humanist approach received new momentum with the increasing influence of the travel- ling poets. Humanism as a distinct cultural phenomenon had early begin- nings in the Empire, particularly in the South.5 In 1460 Peter Luder and Jacob Publicius (Politian) of Florence taught at Erfurt. One of their most 1 Theodor Kolde, Martin Luther, I, Gotha, I884, p. 39. Theodor Kolde, Das religiose Leben in Erfurt beim Ausgange des Mittelalters, Halle, 1898, p. 40, holds that in the city itself the ideal of mediaeval piety persisted so that as late as 1518 new brotherhoods were organ- ized in Erfurt. Similarly Paul Kalkoff, Humanismus und Reformation in Erfurt (I5oo- 153o), Halle, 1926, p. 16, believes that the spirit of dissent in the University has been over-emphasized. While individuals may have expressed critical sentiments, the faculty of theology was not anti-curial, but con- formed even in the crisis of 1520. 2 F. W. Kampschulte, op. cit., pp. 30 et passim, argues that scholasticism was not so dominant here as elsewhere, there were no tourneys of disputation, more stress on bibli- cal knowledge, and the like. 3 Acten der Erfurter Universitdt, p. viii; G.

SPITZ promising students was Johann von Dalberg who later became closely asso- ciated with Rudolph Agricola in the humanist movement at Heidelberg. At Heidelberg Conrad Celtes also studied under Agricola. He later became a leader in the sodalitas literaria Rhenana, a humanist association of the second generation of humanists, men like Dietrich von Plenningen, Eitelwolf von Stein, Trithemius, Ulrich Zasius, John Reuchlin, and Willibald Pirkheimer. In 1486 Celtes in turn taught at the University of Erfurt and proved to be an inspiration to many of the students, including Mutian, who recalled his in- struction gratefully many years later. Thomas Wolf of Strassburg also taught at Erfurt during Mutian's student days, as did Sommering, who gave popular lectures on Terence.2 But in spite of this introduction of humanist learning and its gradual extension at Erfurt, the via moderna was still the characteristic and dominant intellectual mode at Erfurt to the end of the century, that is, through and beyond Mutian's student days. It is true that the three leading figures at the University at the turn of the century, Henning Goede, professor of jurisprudence, Jodocus Trutvetter, in philosophy, and Bartholom'ius Arnoldi of Usingen, the leading theologian, made concessions to the new learning and even promoted it in a limited way. But it is also true that the young "humanists," including Mutian, were still formally within the framework of the old pattern, debating quaestiones with zeal. Significantly, one of the most important questions under consideration in this late scholastic philosophy was the problem of epistemology. The basic scholastic presuppositions were under examination and the next decades were to see a variety of answers to this leading quaestio. If the scholastic philosophy showed surprising virility and longevity, the transition to a humanist predominance was rapid and sensational. Henricus Aquilapolensis, a humanist of the more tentative hesitant type, was active in reforming the old mediaeval grammar. In 1494, the year of Mutian's departure from the University, Maternus Pistoris, an avowed humanist, joined the philosophy faculty. Camerarius later praised him lavishly, Eobanus Hessus called him "the foremost devotee of the Muses," and Mutian himself corresponded with him concerning classical learning.3 In 1501 Nicolaus Mar- schalk published the first Greek book in Erfurt, but the following year he moved to the new University of Wittenberg.4 In the year 1509 Mutian wrote to Herbord, a wealthy young protege who was, after a long conflict between pressure for a legal career and classical learning, becoming an important figure at the University, "I congratulate the younger instructors, for they are freeing themselves from barbarism." At the same time he wrote to the rector of the University: "You may like it or not, but the number of the cultured is increas- ing. I want you to know it."5 A city revolution took place in that year in which the townspeople fought the council.8 The consequent disturbance 1 Krause 636, pp. 654 f. 2Krause 174, p. 223. 3 Krause 32, p. 39; Krause 59, p. 65. 4 For publications of the classics in Erfurt, cf.

He does not discuss the r61e of the humanists in the affair, however.</page><page sequence="7">THE CONFLICT OF IDEALS IN MUTIANUS RUFUS 127 resulted in the temporary disbanding of the humanist circle, but by 1512 most of Mutian's friends had returned to Erfurt and in the summer of 1512 one of them, Heinrich Eberbach, was chosen rector of the University and humanism had at last gained a triumph. But Erfurt was by no means the pioneer in the establishment of a humanist programme. Indeed, by 1520 the new culture had made its way into all the larger universities of the Empire. In fact, the Rhenish universities of Basle and Heidelberg were at least twenty to thirty years ahead of Erfurt.' In the struggle for humanist learning at Erfurt Mutian was a participant, rather than a direct beneficiary, of its triumph. In its progress he and the circle of poets gathered about his pupil Eobanus Hessus played a decisive r6le.2 Up to the time of his departure for Italy, Mutian had been exposed to a variety of influences. At Deventer particularly, he was impressed with the emphasis upon inner piety that remained a component part of his religious philosophy. Classical learning was but a means to serve religious ends. He had been alternately exposed to the via antiqua and with equal enthusiasm to the via moderna. He was personally committed to neither and became increasingly hostile to scholasticism of any kind. The severe criticism of ecclesiastical practice and dogma made a lasting impression upon him. The intense concern for the problem of epistemology must have raised for Mutian the question of validity and certitude and inspired him to a further search for a satisfactory philosophy. Perhaps it was this stimulus in addition to the humanist inspira- tion supplied by Celtes and others which prompted him to give up his position at the University of Erfurt and journey southward. His itinerary included Bologna, Ferrara, Rome, Mantua, Venice, and Florence. He enjoyed the friendship and hospitality of the then popular poet Baptista Mantuanus and of Francesco Piccolomini, later to become Pius III. He devoted a year and a half to legal studies at Bologna. Above all, in Italy, at a still impressionable age, he learned to know the philosophy of the Floren- tine Platonists. After a brief term as councillor upon his return to Hessia in 1503, he entered the chapter of Mary in Gotha as a canon where he spent the remainder of his life. A strong scholastic and Aristotelian tradition persisted in Italy throughout the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, particularly in the University of Padua. This was not merely a residue carried into a new period from a former one, but was an indication that the earlier humanism had not provided a substitute in the form of real philosophy. The humanists produced primarily literature, not philosophy, and while bitterly criticizing scholasticism and opposing Aristotle, they "put in his place not Plato, but Cicero."3 It was only in the last half of the century that Manetti, Pico, and Ficino sought to construct a 1 Friedrich Zarncke, Aufsitze und Reden zur Kultur-und Zeitgeschichte, Leipzig, 1898, p. 163.

Paul Kalkoff, op. cit., p. 13, maintains, however, that the opposition to scholasticism demonstrated real strength only after the Leipzig debate, when Justus Jonas assumed the leadership in the University and the influence of Mutian receded. 3 P.

There was some truth in Guiseppe Toffanin's attempt to describe humanism as an orthodox Catholic movement, which was designed to defend the church against unchristian individualism. But it is more accurate to understand the Florentine movement as an effort to recon- struct scholasticism not only by way of an apologetic or change of form, but as a new theological affirmation, with the special objective vis-d-vis Averroism of maintaining the dignity of the individual soul. Pico's Conclusiones and Apology as well as his three theological works were clearly in the scholastic tradition.1 Similarly Ficino's Theologia Platonica was as much a reconstruction of a positive metaphysical structure as a defence against Averroism. He believed in the harmony of Platonism and Christianity, both representing real spiritual values in identifying the highest good with the knowledge and enjoy- ment of God.2 Thus humanism which began as a non-philosophical reaction against scholasticism, in order to supply a philosophical substance, came to absorb the scholastic tradition. It has been suggested with some plausibility that the Savonarola episode tended to repress this speculative philosophy further into the older catholic piety.3 In any case, the Florentine Platonism which Mutian learned to know represented an effort at a constructive theology in the service of Christian piety and in opposition to Averroism, lifeless scholasticism, and the half-stoic eudemonistic religiosity or irreligiosity charac- teristic of some earlier Italian humanism. The full and most significant impact of the Italian travels and studies upon Mutian must be measured not in terms of his increasing impatience with abuse or of his phenomenal acquisition of a broad humanist learning, but primarily in terms of the influence of Florentine Platonism upon his thought. Platonism was far from being a new phenomenon for Mutian. Neoplatonic thought, of course, had contributed much to Christian theology throughout the patristic and mediaeval period, so that one scholar has ventured the sug- gestion that what could be learned from Plato and the Neoplatonists for the purposes of a constructive distinctively Christian theology had been learned long before.4 Moreover, some of the men at Erfurt who directly or indirectly exerted a great influence upon Mutian were not strangers to Platonic ideas. Johann Wesel, for example, prized Plato above Aristotle and studied himself under the Greek Platonists in Italy. Similarly Celtes had gathered an im- pressive library of Platonic writings at Augsburg. But the consciously con- structed synthesis of the Florentine Platonists with its striking Neoplatonic features developed in a metaphysically arid time had a special impact upon 1 Leon Dorez and Louis Thuasne, Pic de la Mirandole en France, 1485-1488, Paris, 1897, p. 28. 2 P.

The nature and extent of that impact remain to be considered. Mutian wished to be considered a philosopher, not a mere philologist, rhetorician, or literatus in the purely humanist sense of the word. He disliked very much being compared with Cicero and much preferred speaking of the "philosophus sanctus."2 Thomas Wolf the younger called Mutian "without a doubt our greatest philosopher and orator."3 Although his suggestion for the organization of a model university was no doubt in part a jest, especially in view of the fact that when Erfurt was reorganized in 1519 according to humanist ideals, he participated very little, it may indicate in some measure the value he placed upon the sound philosopher. He wrote to Urban in 1513: "It would be enough in a great university, if there were one sophist, two mathematicians, three theologians, four jurists, five doctors, six orators, seven Hebraists, eight Graecists, nine grammarians, and ten right-minded philoso- phers as presidents and chiefs of the whole literary undertaking."4 It was an all but inevitable result of Mutian's previous education and experience that he should react strongly against the sacramental-sacerdotal system as it had developed in the late scholastic period. As a foil to his positive philosophy this negative emphasis merits special examination. One of the dominant notes in Mutian's writing was the protest against ceremonies, including the whole concept of sacramental efficaciousness ex opere operato. References to the barbarous practices, mocking the tonsure, and the like are very numerous.5 "Only the ignorant seek salvation in fasts," is a recurring theme. Himself a canon, he reacted violently to the theory and practice of rote prayers. "When I am called by the hour bell to the pious murmuring with the canons, I am like a Cappadocian fireworshipper (Pyraethian)," he wrote.6 Not oracular confession and prayer, but work and virtues deserve reward.' Relics, benefice seeking, usury against the peasants, all were roundly condemned. He excoriated the ethics of the clergy. Rome was the "hell of all crimes." He had seen Borgian Rome. In a Donatist fashion he doubted the efficacy of the religious acts of corrupt priests. A typical example of his jibes at current beliefs and practices is his letter to Peter Eberbach in i512: I always chuckle heartily, when Benedict tells me of the complaints of your mother that you go to church so seldom, do not wish to fast, and eat eggs contrary to the common usage.

SPITZ ... He fasted and died.... That he ate eggs was due to the fact that he had no hens. If these had been there, they would never again have laid eggs. When some heard this, they wrinkled their brows and said, "Who will absolve you wicked Christians?" "Studies," I answered, "and knowledge !"1 A second illustration of this kind of criticism must suffice. It re-emphasizes his concern for spirit over ceremony and the institutionalization of the office of the keys. To Herbord he and Urban wrote: We are taken under the protection of the living God and confess with the Apostle, what is beyond faith, is sin .... This is worth so much to all people that usually it is believed that the keys of heaven have been de- livered to us. Who therefore despises our keys will feel the nail and the rod. ... We pastors and bishops (for Presbyters and bishops are used in the Holy Scriptures in many places to mean the same thing) will strike you with a great scourge, if you will not listen to the meaning of our commands. You may say in opposition: "A cleric who bears weapons should be excommunicated," or, "A good priest should be no manslayer." But do you not know what the weapons are? We have accepted from the breast of Serapis a magic character, which Jesus of Galilee did not lend to his authority. With that figure we frighten the enemies, entice money, sanctify God, shatter hell, and do miracles, heavenly or criminal. It is irrelevant that we actually are only the blessed guests of Jupiter. Fare- well.2 This raises the problem of Mutian's own ethical standards. It is clear that his criticism of the morals of the priesthood did not stem from a Puritanical attitude of superiority. He freely admitted his share of minor vices. He con- cluded not a few letters with the confession, "Haec scripsi bene inebrius."3 Moreover, he himself enjoyed the income of a prebendary and played the game of benefice seeking with gusto, actually securing "livings" for a good number of his humanist friends. There is some truth in the judgment that while ethical himself he was in expression sharp and cynical.4 His oft-cited letters to Urban on the occasion of his difficulties with a nun in the neighbour- ing convent reflect a want of respect for the common morality which seems to stem from the fact that the humanist ideal was aristocratic and aesthetic, distinguishing the beautiful and the ugly, the refined and the vulgar, tending towards a relativity on matters of morality. On the other hand, it must be remembered that these letters were written to an Urban who was actually very distressed and Mutian may have felt that a certain amount of bravado would supply as much comfort as any other approach.5 Many statements 1 Krause 596, p. 636, text in Gillert 163, p. 233.

He forbade his students to write Goliardic verse. Very significantly, he opposed the crowned poets who were zealous in opposition to theology. The youth should read only chaste poets, the priests should read none, with the exception of Baptista Mantuanus. The mysteries of theology are not to be profaned.' Much of Mutian's criticism was of a conventional nature in the old tradi- tion. General dissatisfaction with prevailing conditions was increasing during these decades.2 The general pattern of the humanist criticism is familiar to all through the Epistolae Obscurorum Virorum and Brant's Narrenschiff. Unlike Heinrich Bebel's popular Facetiae, which Mutian read and recommended in 1509, Mutian's criticism employed the resources of a remarkable classical erudition.3 But a more fundamental factor distinguished most of his criticism from the common expressions of dissatisfaction and ridicule which were the order of the day. He stressed individuality and personal responsibility in contrast to the objectivization of religion in the institutionalized framework. He consistently protested against the externalization and vulgarization of spiritual meaning and values. That his characteristic expressions were of this nature can be explained only in the context of his positive philosophy. The characteristic attitude of much humanism was critical and negative in its orientation. Mutian in contrast opposed the poets who attacked theology. He desired renovation rather than rejection. He reflected the concern of contemporary Florentine thinkers for a constructive theology to replace in part and revitalize in part the desiccated and 'vulnerable structure of late scholasticism. The externalization of dogma into mechanical formulae ad- ministered by an institutionalized organization had reduced Christianity almost to the do ut des, the quid pro quo basis of more primitive, less highly rationalized religions. Mutian developed his religious conceptions with a full awareness of the urgent necessity for a renewed emphasis upon spirituality. The most significant element in Mutian's constructive religious thought was his consistent spiritualization of the Judaeo-Christian theological heritage. This tendency was related to the very heart of philosophy as it was understood by Ficino. In a letter to John Gozaltes he wrote: "Since philosophy is by all defined as love of wisdom, wisdom is in truth the contemplation of divine things, certainly the end of philosophy is a knowledge of divine things." True philosophy, then, consists in transcending the phenomenal world to the world of ideas. "For whoever is avid for truth, turns his mind to the contemplation of divine things and places little significance upon the desires of the body." The meaning of philosophy, then, is in rising above nature through the spirit, not by despising or denying the corporeal and the natural-Ficino was a doctor-but things corporeal should be strictly limited in the totality of human existence and directed towards correct ends. This dualistic world picture and 1 Krause 142, p. 189 (1510). On the signi- ficance of Mantuanus for English literature, especially Spenser, cf.

SPITZ the striving of the philosopher to rise above the corporeal was a dialectical conception, Ficino warned, which was not to be understood in terms of a formal logic, but rather in terms of a method for attaining to the truth. Philosophy is thus a way for the identification of man and God. The philoso- pher can become on earth a mediator between God and man (Quippe inter Deum et homines medius est Philosophus, ad Deum homo, ad homines Deus). Such was Ficino's conception of the rational ethical and religious value whose last and deepest meaning was in the final step the redemption of man. In the end the soul of man returns to its supermundane home where it contemplates the secret mysteries of the Creator.1 The undogmatic and dynamic nature of this view of God, man, and nature is reflected in Mutian's religious philosophy. In contrast to a static Aristotelian-scholastic conception of God as pure being to be approached only through well-defined formal theological avenues, Mutian viewed God as dynamically and immanently active. His was a "deus vivus," a Spirit in and with all life and being.2 God could and did inspire men immediately to charity and friendship. The Spirit of God fills the orb of the earth. "He is that God, pure love, who breathes where He wills and establishes true and perfect friendship among mortals. He is, I say, that divine inspiration who makes you religious men of unanimous and harmonious minds, through whom no love is dishonest, without whose intervention there is no pure delight. Of this must be understood that saying: Whom God has joined together, let not man put asunder."3 This view of God had also important implications for his christology. The significance of ChriSt to Mutian lay in the spiritual qualities which He essentially was and represented. He distinguished in that way between the Christ and the historical Jesus. True religion recognized the Christ who descended from heaven as righteousness, peace, and joy. Opposition to anthropomorphic views of God was certainly nothing new with Mutian. Dante had explained it beautifully: Few only through the senses can it grasp What later it makes fit for intellect. Therefore the Holy Scripture condescends To meet your faculties, and speaks of God As having hands and feet, but means it not. -Paradiso, Canto 44 Mutian went further. He attacked any unusual reverence for the humanity of Christ stemming from His divinity. Reacting against the profane regard for relics of the human Jesus, he exclaimed to Urban: "Janus will tell you of the beard of Christ. Oh, what a beard! Christ detested falsehood and yet no one lies more impudently than the priests of Christ. I do not revere the tunic and beard .... I worship the living God, who did not appear in cloak and beard. ... The theologians err."5 In this vein Mutian suggested that 1 Cf.

Apollonius was a Pythagorean who died around 98 A.D., the author of several books on sacri- fice, astrological prediction, and letters. But his real biography had no relation to the myth which grew about him as the incarnation of the religious ideal of the Neopythagoreans. Philostratus's Life of Apollonius of Tyana, published by Aldus in 1504 and therefore available to Mutian, was clearly analogous to the picture of Christ in the four gospels and included the story of his trial before Domitian in Rome. This spurious biography originated most likely in the circle gathered, around Julia Domna and was designed to discredit the gospel narrative. Mutian accepted it, or at least used it, and thereby approximated the ancient Docetist heresy that Christ's body was a phantasm and that His passion was a mere appearance. He faced the question posed by Ignatius, "If, as some godless men say, Christ suffered in mere appearance, being them- selves mere appearances, why am I in bonds?"2 Clearly in his view of the person of Christ Mutian was on the thin edge of historic Christianity. In much the same fashion Mutian spiritualized the sacraments. He considered sacraments and mysteries as then practised ridiculous.3 The real significance of the sacrament lay not in the corporeal transubstantiation, but in the essence of the sacrament, in love. No host can be more holy than mutual love.4 The true Christ is not food and drink, he wrote to Urban, in a very explicit passage: They are ignorant of the fruit of true religion. Oh, Urban, our Re- deemer is the lamb and the shepherd. But who is our saviour? Righteous- ness, peace, and joy. This is the Christ who descended from heaven. The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, fortunate faith, and untroubled tranquillity in humility. This chalice of salvation I will receive and call upon the name of the Lord. Would that we would consume such bread of angels worthily! "My food," says the eternal truth, the living law, the head of the church, "is that I do the will of Him that sent me and accomplish His work." If therefore the will of God is to obey the divine commands, if it is the highest of commands that we love God and our neighbour, think, my Urban, whether those fools rightly take the food of God, who devour the host and against the sacrament of Christian love, destroy the peace and disseminate hatreds.5 As the basis of ethics Mutian urged the universal applicability of the law of love in contrast to legalism. The two commandments, love of God and love of fellow-man, comprise the essence of the natural law written in the hearts of man as a kind of natural knowledge." This moral law is closely associated with the peace and harmony ruling in the wider universe, the law 1 Krause 85, pp. 93 f. 2 Documents of the Christian Church, Henry Bettenson, editor, New York, 1947, P- 50.

SPITZ which the nations revere with the instinct of nature. He wrote to Urban: Moses, Plato, Christ taught it. This is prescribed in our hearts. For who does not know that harmony and mutual love is divine, holy, and very dear to God, since God rules all things in a certain order, so that nothing opposes another. From this eternal law priests and emperors make constitutions not entirely bad, if the evil of the interpreters is absent. For you yourself feel that men are evil who for the sake of money itself turn black to white and worthless glosses, so that they defend unfair interest rates and usuries. The others imitate equity and the common good and law of nations, which by me is rightly called eternal law, which I observe and admire in the work of the heavenly spheres, and the high God in that great and most beautiful and best arranged world I laud and praise with the church.1 Though Christ represented and made explicit this natural law to the fullest extent, it was given at least partial expression in the laws of Draco, Solon, Lycurgus, Moses, Plato, Pythagoras, the decemvirs, and others.2 In so far as Mutian was not bound by traditionalism or by humanist aristocratic notions, this concept of natural law also influenced his political and social thinking, though not as immediately as it did his ethical theory. When, for example, the people's party arose in the city of Erfurt against the city council, the rich bourgeois syndics, for shielding a city official from punishment for fraud, Mutian and the young humanists sided with the commoners, while Goede and the older men sided with the council and went down to defeat and exile. Mutian cited every authority from Solon down in the people's cause. He wrote to Herbord that who entered the fray was wise, the most honest, and the most virtuous. "It is foolish to believe that princely men are just born; they come often from the lowest class; already Isocrates said there would be better rulers if they were elected. An Emperor is made, not born."3 Is it fanciful to see in this association of the idea of natural law with the political representative ideal an anticipation on the individual level of the later development of the republican system based on natural right?4 Different social and political conditions might have given Mutian's suggestion wide historic consequences. There is a close relationship between Mutian's theory of natural law and his whole anthropology. Man is intimately related to all other beings in the universe. For Mutian, as for Ficino, man was an intermediate being in the universe, drawn towards God, truth, and goodness, and at the same time bound by the sensual. To describe this duality, Mutian used two terms current in Christian theology from Paul to late scholasticism, but not used in the Theologia Platonica, corpus and carnis. In so far as man is a mirror of the macro- cosm, a divine reflection of God Himself, he belongs to the genus of God, he is a little god. To Urban Mutian explained: "By discourse alone we reveal 1 Krause 52, p. 57. 2 Krause 69, p. 75; Krause 52, p. 57. 3 Krause 147, P. 195. 4Cf.

Whence we are spoken of as servants of heaven, if we have lived spiritually or philosophically or in a Christian way, conforming more to the spirit than to passion."1 The religious man especially is a divine light and majesty.2 This view of man and his spiritual and philosophical affinity to God is clearly related to the idea of man as microcosm as developed by Pico and Ficino.3 The carnis, or sensate side of man, related to the material world, does not participate in the higher life and will have no part in the resurrection. Mutian at times questioned the possibility of the soul itself being sentient in an after-life.4 The resurrection was spiritual, as the soul rises after the remis- sion of sins.5 Nevertheless, Mutian did not consistently maintain an absolute identity of man with the divinity. A qualitative difference remained. The ethical difference still represented the chasm between absolute and relative good. God is the judge, man the judged. All will be called before the judg- ment seat of God. Who then will maintain the validity of worldly wisdom and secular learning before the eternal God?6 God and man are still extremes joined in the mediator Christ.7 Similar conflicting modes of thought are evident in his view of nature. A new feeling towards nature appeared during the Renaissance, a kind of mystical sentiment coloured by a variety of religious ideas. This view of nature very understandably prospered among the Florentine Platonists. There is really nothing bad in nature, for all the world is much alive, Ficino main- tained.8 Mutian in a similar way viewed the cosmos in a more metaphysically mystic than in an empiric way, stressing the beauty and form of the world, referring to the peace reigning in the planets and the great mother earth, our goddess.9 Drawing inspiration from Pliny, Lucian, and Ovid, he exclaimed, "For at the same time Sol, the father of gods and men, pours out the breath of life abundantly, the true soul of the world, the highest Godhead of nature and heaven."10 The world reflects brilliance and soul as the sun. Nature itself is pious. The earth is most holy.11 It is this type of expression which has earned for Mutian a reputation for pantheism.12 In this respect the problem of Mutian's view of nature closely resembles that raised by Nicolas Cusanus. Nicolas held God to be the Possest, the abso- lute potentiality in actuality, including all the positive attributes of God, and in this Principle is contained all that can in any way exist. Moreover, God is the coincidentia oppositorum, for by being infinite He is the principle of all number 1 Krause 85, p. 94. 2Krause 553, p. 621: "Religiosus salu- tandum erat numen."

Io 3, developed from Dionysius the Areopagite the idea of man as lumen divinum. It is a curious fact that astrology, related to the microcosm idea from antiquity and seem- ingly its natural consequence, played no part in Mutian's thinking. Perhaps he rejected it on ethical grounds, following Pico's lead, as being inconsistent with the creative autonomy of the individual. 4 Krause 223, p. 278. 5 Krause 49, p. 53. 6 Krause 331, p. 403. 7Krause ii, p. 12. 8 Marsilii Ficini, Philosophi, Platonici, Medici atque Theologi clarissimi, Opera, etc., p. i082. 9 Krause 52, p. 57; Krause 89, pp. 97 ff. 10 Krause 75, p. 8o. 11 Krause 25, p. 28; Krause 488, pp. 551i f. 12 Ludwig Geiger, "Mutian," Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, p.

Thus God for Cusanus was demonstrably the coincidence of all opposites. The world and nature was then the explicatio complicati by a kind of Neoplatonic emanation from God.1 Nicolas did not teach that the concrete world was related to God as the part to the whole. Rather, he brought God and the sensible world under the same concept of a reality having two sides. God is the invisible side of creation and creation is an apparition of the invisible God. This close identification of God and nature raised the question of pantheism from his own day to our own.2 Interestingly, Giordano Bruno in the sixteenth century arrived by an intellectual Odyssey much like Mutian's from scholasticism to Neoplatonism, to a feeling for the infinity of the universe and, in partial dependence on Nicolas, to a pantheistic position.3 Mutian's view of nature has essential features very similar to both men: the Neo- platonic sources of their thought, the mystic view of nature, the close identifi- cation of God and nature. Several basic differences, however, must be noted. Even in his exalted feeling about man and nature, Mutian was forced to qualify his expressions by, the sheer facts of life. "Being born, we die, and the end hangs already from the beginning." Moreover, Mutian's statements on the relation of God to the world actually occur as a result of rhetorical or literary inspiration and are buttressed by citation from classical authors. Un- like the case of either Cusa or Bruno, he did not arrive at this extremism as a logical necessity following from a closely argued metaphysical system. Finally, his thought on the whole reflects the Hebraic-Christian historical view of the distinction between creature and Creator. He wrote, for example, "We read Aristotle and Plato and this suffices. Turned to Christ, we picture Christ to ourselves. We leave behind the entelechy of Aristotle and the ideas of Plato. God created all things from nothing. He spoke and they were done .... We know that nature is nothing, if not, as Empedocles said, a mixture of elements. In the same tenor Anaxagoras said nature was condensation and diffusion, that is a rising and a falling."4 Mutian agreed with Paul that God was "ultramundanus."5 For Mutian, therefore, time and eternity, the finite material and the infinite immaterial stood in a paradoxical rather than an analogical relationship. He was intellectually clear of pantheism and even of panen- theism, to borrow Dilthey's terminology. The second major aspect of Mutian's constructive theology was the univer- salism implicit and expressed in his religious thinking. His spiritualization of 1 Edmond Vansteenberghe, "Autour de la docte ignorance, une controverse sur la thto- logie mystique au XVe siecle," Beitrdge zur Geschichte der Philosophie des Mittelalters, XIV, 1915, P.

Mutian implied such a tendency by using classic and Christian terminology interchangeably. He called Benedict "Pythagoras," heaven was the realm of Jupiter (Christ), Hell was Tartarus, Mary, the mother of the great thunderer.1 His statements on this universalist thesis are so explicit as to merit direct quotation. In agree- ment with the Koran which he often cited, he stressed virtue as the essence of true religion: New clothes, new ceremonies are introduced, as though God were honoured by clothes and garments. In the Alcoran one reads, "Who prays to the eternal God and lives virtuously, he may be a Jew, Christian, or a Saracen, he receives the grace of God and salvation." Therefore through right living and not through new garment is God satisfied: for the only true honouring of God consists in not doing evil. He is religious, right living, pious, who has a pure heart. All else is smoke.2 Just as no faith has a monopoly on the essence of true religion, so the physical accoutrements of one religion have no special significance not common to all: I do not agree with those who hold only the churchyard for holy. Every place belongs to the holy Tellus, which the learned call also Ceres, Rhea, Ops, Cybele, Proserpina, and the great Mother. He is therefore in the lap of mother, whether the credulous brother wishes it or not.3 Mutian argued that the spiritual nativity of Christ occurred before all ages, so that Christ, much as Justin Martyr had conceived of the spermatic logos, the true wisdom of God, was present with the Jews in Syria, with the Greeks, Italians, and even the Germans, though their religions were observed by different rituals and priesthoods.4 This religious universalism was certainly not a legacy of the Devotio Moderna as Mutian came to know it at Deventer under Hegius. There one brother was sharply reprimanded for writing "thus God is spoken of in Ovid just as in Augustine."5 Rather it was clearly derived from the Florentine Platonists, the probable source for Zwingli of a very similar idea. Ficino held the Alexandrine historical myth that all philosophical and religious knowledge both before and after Christ was derived from the Hebraic-Christian special revelation. Plato was a pupil of Moses. His Neoplatonic commentators were imitators of St. John, St. Paul, Hierotheus, and Dionysius the Areopagite.6 1 Krause 25, p. 28: "There is but one God and one Goddess, but there are many names: Jupiter, Sol, Apollo, Moses, Christ, Luna, Ceres, Proserpina, Tellus, Mary. . . .

I ff. Cf. Clement of Alexandria,</page><page sequence="18">138 LEWIS W. SPITZ Similarly Pico's unity of truth presupposed a syncretism of philcsophical and religious truths. Mutian concurred in this universalist view, but deduced it metaphysically from his belief in the immanent activity of God's spirit inspiring men to truth and virtue, rather than from the historical myth of transfer or borrowing from Palestinian sources. The third major component of Mutian's positive philosophy was the moral interpretation of Paulinism. Ficino following Dionysius and Plotinus had stressed the idea of the free spirit and the fatherhood of God, the overcoming of the flesh, and beauty, purity, and form in ethics.1 Mutian's inclination towards this type of piety may have been partly temperamental, well suited to the Beata Tranquillitas, his home. "If only my life finds rest in piety and the leisure of teachings! Our study concerns God and holy men and a knowledge of all antiquity; if to delight in this itself is possible, I am de- lighted and I rejoice," he confided to Urban shortly after his arrival in Gotha.2 The return to original sources was in a sense the heart of Renaissance humanism. The stress on the return to Christian sources was the heart of the new humanism of the Florentine Platonists. Particularly Pico and Ficino were interested in a renascens pietas, the restitutio Christianismi, and in Christum ex fontibus praedicare. The drive adfontes led them to a renewed appreciation of the writings of the Fathers, and most significant of all, to a renewed study of the New Testament, and especially of the epistles of Paul. In urging the study of the Scriptures and Fathers, Mutian held up Pico himself as an example of respect and devotion to this type of study.3 Ficino directed much of his study to Paul's epistles. He tried by referring to the Greek text of the New Testament to grasp the meaning of the epistle to the Romans, for example, in terms of its own historical setting and its specific concepts. It remained more noteworthy as an attempt than as an achievement, for his interpretation was so full of Plato that he failed to overcome either his own philosophical preconceptions or the dogmatic tradition by a discovery of the true historical context or of the unique religious insight of Paul. An interesting study in contrast would be the comparison of Ficino and Luther's exegesis of the Epistles of Paul. The key passages of Romans so significant for Luther's fidistic insight, chapter 5, for example, receive an entirely different treat- ment from Ficino. Faith is that which justifies by love. The accent through- out is on love and charity rather than on the reconciliation with God through faith.4 This emphasis was beyond a doubt a carry-over from his overwhelm- ing emphasis on divine love as Plato defined it, the desire to contemplate anew the divine beauty, an emphasis fully developed in the De religione Christiana and the Theologia Platonica, both of which Mutian knew well.5 Stromateis, I, v. 28, in Documents of the Christian Church, p. 70. 1 Plotini Enneades cum Marsilii Ficini inter- pretatione castigata, Paris, 1845, p. z 6, de beatitudine, Ennead IV, III, p. 207: "Lex divina animis insita ducit eos tam sponte quam necessario ad terminos affectioni eorum convenientes.

He was less concerned with problems of grace and justification than Colet or Lefevre, more in the synergistic morality position of Erasmus. Mutian read and valued many of Lefevre's writings on Aristotle, the Commentary on Paul's Epistles, the Psalms, and the like. Bossus (Florentine preacher), Zenobius (Vatican librarian and translater of Eusebius), Baptista Mantuanus, Erasmus, and Reuchlin he considered "true theologians."' Although he does not seem to have read Colet, Mutian, of course, knew Erasmus well, corresponded and exchanged gifts with him, and developed a striking intellectual affinity with him.2 Mutian knew Biblical literature and the Fathers, having read all of Augustine, Ambrose, Leo, and especially ofJerome.3 He cherished Erasmus's edition ofJerome and of the New Testament. He called Erasmus the restorer of theology upon whose shoulders Oecolampadius, Melanchthon, and Luther stood.4 This first aspect, then, of Mutian's ethical Paulinism, the return to the original norms of Christian behaviour and primitive sources of inspira- tion in the early church had the result of minimizing the importance of the sacramental-sacerdotal system. The second aspect of Mutian's ethical Paulinism, also parallel to Erasmus's philosophia Christi, was his emphasis on piety, the lex Christi. "We are pursuing a narrow and deep, arduous and difficult path.... We aim at righteousness, temperance, patience, concord, truth and friendship."5 "The highest God must be revered with the greatest piety."6 His appreciation for Benedict, Bernard, and other monastic leaders stemmed not from their ascetic lives or foundations (he hated Francis, Dominic, and the mendicant friars especially), but from their examples of Christian virtues. He praised Bernard for his humility on the one hand, and the humanist Eitelwolf von Stein for his learn- ing on the other, with perfect consistency.7 This trust in piety and the ability to lead the good life presupposed a confidence in human freedom and moral capability. Mutian himself lacked a deep sense of sin, the meaning and implications of the ethical and qualitative difference between God and man which he himself acknowledged formally. At one time he said that he himself had lived innocently for twenty-two years and had lived without offending anyone. He could say with full conviction that piety is the guide to life. Tranquillity of conscience and the security of innocence removes all doubt as to sinless self-sufficiency.8 The essence of the lex Christi, then, was not a sin-grace antithesis, but was the teaching of Christ as the new and highest revealer of true ethical principles. The essence of the new dogma lay in the good examples, holy morals, Christian rules. "The Christian religion teaches me that it prohibits the evil which I would prefer to enter into," he wrote to Urban.9 This was "the heavenly and pious philosophy," he wrote in Erasmian terms.10 Through his higher morality and 1 Cf.

SPITZ keener insight, Christ gave man decrees and laws by which men can bring their lives to a richer fulfilment. He wrote, "I therefore rest quietly in the simple gospel, having turned myself wholly to the decrees of Christ and cast off all cares."' This piety, while possibly related to the self-assurance of the rising lay bourgeoisie, was nevertheless not a secular morality divorced of ecclesiastical implications. In 1510o Mutian wrote: I have decided to direct my studies and my learning to piety and to take from the poets, philosophers, and legists only that which serves a pious life. It is godless to try and be wiser than the church. Should I offend God and men through frivolousness? Certainly I must not offend. We carry on our forehead the seal of the cross, the standard of our King. We do not wish to be transgressors. No one can serve Christ and Baal. Holy is the army of our general. Nothing shameful shall be with us in our camp.2 This last statement in particular raises the question of Mutian's conformity to institutional standards of life and dogma and of his mysterious desire to restrict his ostensibly considered religious ideas to the knowledge of a few intimate friends. This attitude of Mutian's has puzzled many students of northern humanism. Ludwig Geiger asked whether this Mutian who asked Urban and Herbord to burn his letters was the Mutian who boldly condemned the Cologners for burning the Augenspiegel. Did he wish to forbid the unlearned entrance to the sacred halls? Was he a hypocrite, offering one hand to the learned and another to his unlearned friends? Was it fear of joining in the vae victis? Who can solve this riddle, the solution of which would be important with respect to the individual man, but becomes of the highest importance, since in a sense it characterizes a generation?3 We may suggest a variety of reasons for his reluctance to publish his views. He himself described how he had resolved never to publish any of his work or seek the laurel wreath. In- deed, he felt he had good precedent for his habit of non-publication, for Galba, Socrates, and Christ had written nothing.4 In fact, we know of only one sizable work, a book on rhetoric which Melanchthon planned to publish in 1538 but never actually did. But Mutian sought to restrict the circulation of his own letters in an age when the common code allowed the printing of personal letters. Mysteries must not be popularized, he wrote to Urban.5 To Herbord he wrote: "If you love me, you will tear up my letters. If you fail to do so I shall not dare cavil as I do."6 He even refused to lend his reading notes to Herbord for fear they might be made public. One possible explanation for this esoteric restriction of his views to his philosophic friends may be that of personal timidity. He frequently pleaded, after expressing some unconventional religious viewpoint, that he was merely jesting, just playing. Another possible factor was the aristocratic tradition of humanism. Perhaps, though this seems unlikely at least in any immediate 1 Krause 201, p. 256. 2Krause 137, P. 175. 3 Ludwig Geiger, Johann Reuchlin, sein Leben und seine Werke, Leipzig, 1871, p. 351. 4 Krause 96, p. 112. r Cf.

Even the Occamist tradition of the division of rational and revealed or willed (voluntarist) truth, may have influenced his distinction between restricted and common knowledge. Cer- tainly the problem was not unique with him. Possibly all of these factors were of importance in the formulation of his attitude. The most likely explanation, however, lies elsewhere. The basic reason for Mutian's reluctance to express his positive philosophy openly was the fact that he himself was not completely certain of its validity in relation to the old norms and he feared the consequences of its populariza- tion. This did not mean mere timidity out of fear for his own quiet and reputation, but a genuine concern for the good of mother church. In March of 1514, even while supporting Reuchlin with Crotus and the Erfurt men, he wrote in a letter to Urban: Leave to us the paternal religion, most learned Reuchlin, and harm the Christians not, while you defend the Hebrews. You actually harm them, however, when you introduce two Nazarenes with the name ofJesus and oppose to us testimony from Celsus, Julian, Porphyry. For what else is it than that you create a new dogma and darken the truth with old deceptions ?1 Was this expression of concern for the paternal religion the result of a sudden return to religion, an answer to a call received while reciting the breviary? Clearly during and after 1514 expressions of regard for the church and its religion are more numerous. Indeed in that year after a lapse of a decade, he returned to the celebration of the mass. To Urban he wrote: ". .. I shall sing to the Lord a song mystic and divine. I cannot save piety and still stay away longer from the altar and sacrifice. Up to now I have been more an observer than a participant. ... Now I wish with God's grace to sacri- fice the Lord's supper and remembering pray for the living and the dead."2 In that year he accepted Urban's poem Carmen de doctrina domini nostri Jesu Christi pendentis in cruce per modum dialogismi Christi et Christiani, which he had written at Mutian's suggestion in a manner reminiscent of the believing mystic of earlier centuries. Nor was this religious manifestation a phenomenon of old age in line with the transcendentalist idea of infancy and old age being in proximity to infinity, an old age conversion. By 1524, says Strauss, Mutian had exchanged Virgil for the Psalms.3 Baptista died in 1518 as the general of the Carmelite order, Wesel's last request was that he be buried on monastic grounds, and Pico was laid to rest in a Dominican monastery. But Mutian was not old. Both before and after 1514 he expressed both sides of his religious thinking, the novel and the conventional, varying only in frequency and emphasis. Perhaps the shift in emphasis was a matter of temperament, so that after the storms of the Reuchlinist controversy, he retired to the quiet 1 Krause 287, p. 353. 2 Krause 335, P- 408. 3 David Strauss, op. cit., P. 365-</page><page sequence="22">142 LEWIS W. SPITZ and rest of conformity.' But he was always fond of the Psalms and wrote poems on them. He urged Baptista to honour Benedict in verse in the early radical years.2 In August of 1513 he wrote: To reject the authority of the church, with whose body you wish to be a member, is damaging and full of impiety, even if you perceive errors. We know that many things are lies to the wisest men and are not ignorant of how to lead life successfully, as men who are beguiled by religion. In one way the simple reader, in another the erudite understands it. That one is content with bare history, this one, however, is inspired by mysteries, searches the anagogic, allegoric, and tropologies.3 In 1509 Mutian wrote to Herbord, "Who should not submit himself to the authority of the church?"4 At no time, therefore, in spite of abuse or the impulse towards his own constructive theology did Mutian entertain the idea of harming or leaving the church. He desired reformation and not rejection. In this fundamental viewpoint lay the crux of Mutian's differences with the Reformation. It is significant to note that Mutian had taken a more consistently conservative turn long before I5I7. At Erfurt with a student body of around two thousand, Luther had known some of the larger circle of Mutian's poets. Luther knew Peter Eberbach, Crotus Rubeanus, Venatus, Johann Lang, whereas Eoban, Spalatin and others he learned to know only after his emergence from monastic life.5 Luther may have belonged to another circle of humanists gathered by Maternus Pistoris.6 In 1516 Luther and Mutian became friends through Lang and Spalatin, but the friendship was not close or of long duration.7 In 1521 Mutian still admired Luther, but vacil- lated wildly and finally as disorders increased and the Reformation became a matter of obviously serious consequences, Mutian turned against it.8 One reason for the division between Mutian and Luther was simple misunder- standing. Luther, for example, repeated the report which came to him that Mutian denied God's omnipotence.9 Again, Mutian's timidity and a certain amount of self-interest was undeniably a factor. In June 1521, Mutian wrote to Lang, "I am a good friend of the Lutherans. But I must consider my circumstances and position. Doors are broken, windows smashed, and one lives in barbarity. I would be a fool to acknowledge the boisterous Lutherans openly. The holy fathers would murder me. If you good people were in my position, what would you do?"'0 Two months before, Luther had faced the Diet of the Empire. In the same year Eoban wrote that Erasmus pointed out what pruning was needed in God's vineyard and that Luther, a greater man for that reason, took the axe and did the pruning." Why did Mutian 1 Carl Krquse, Helius Eobanus Hessus, sein Leben und seine Werke, I, Gotha, I879, p. 38. 2 Krause 585, p. 634. 3 Krause 287, p. 353; cf. also Krause 146, p. 194. 4 Krause 120o, p. 5. 5 Theodor Kolde, Martin Luther, I, p. 41. e Otto Scheel, Martin Luther, I, Tilbingen, 1917, p. 230o. 7Julius K6stlin, Martin Luther, I, Berlin, 1903, p.

The really fundamental reason for Mutian's opposition to the Reformation lay in the fact that his universal religious ideas, ethical Paulinism, his conformity to the church tradition and institutionalism were simply not compatible with the intensive personal religious ideal of the Reformation. Mutian was not in accord with the sola gratia, solafides, or sola scriptura, the three cardinal elements of Luther's movement. In the conflict of reason and faith, an almost perpetual metaphysical problem and specifically the legacy of the Augustinian and Occamist tradition, Mutian never overcame the bifurcation, the conflict of ideals. Unlike many of his circle of Erfurt humanists, he did not decide for the Reformation.' In brief, then, Mutian was assuredly not a Renaissance man in the Burckhardtian sense.2 Aeneas Silvius in the preceding century was perhaps a better example of this type of churchman. Mutian was not only not a pantheist by intention, but was intellectually clear of this position. He was a theist. Ernst Cassirer's observation that the philosophy of the Quattrocento in its concern with the problems of God, freedom, and immortality was essen- tially theology applies unconditionally to Mutian.3 Moreover, while he stood in a long tradition of criticism of the church, he made an effort to supplant the intellectually sterile scholasticism with a positive philosophy. His con- structive theology might be described in terms of Erasmus's Philosophia Christi, but it was clearly analogous and not derivative. It comprised three main elements, the spiritualizing of dogmatic and ecclesiastical conceptions, the promotion of universalistic ideas, and the moral interpretation of Paulinism. Neoplatonic sources, specifically the Florentine school, had the decisive in- fluence upon his thought. Plato was to him the "summus Philosophus." Finally, in the course of his intellectual development, in statements derived from various sources, and even in single letters, there is revealed a conflict of ideals which he never fully resolved. His last written words were: "The peasant knows many things which the philosopher does not know. Christ, our life, died for us. This I do believe as most certain." And so in his last days he turned to a thought which he had learned at Deventer from the Imitatio Christi of Thomas a LKempis. He had actually never ventured far beyond the shelter of that faith. 1 Ernst Troeltsch, "Protestantisches Chris- tentum und Kirche in der Neuzeit," Die Kultur der Gegenwart, part I, IV, I, Berlin, i9o9, discusses the humanist theology especi- ally as presented by Erasmus, its relation to the theology of the Reformation, and its con- tinuity in the thought of Ochino, Castellio, Servetus, and the Socinians. He fails to con- sider the deeper religious and psychological factors which led many younger humanists to join and even lead in the Reformation movement. 2 The picture of the egotistic, immoral aesthete, the frivolous despiser of religion except as a bridle for the masses has, of course, long since been proved inapplicable to the leading and representative figures of Italian humanism.
