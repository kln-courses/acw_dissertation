Hassell We review recent research on the behavioural ecology and population dynamics of parasitoids. After a brief introduction to the biology of parasitoids, we describe how the application of behavioural ecological techniques has lead to greater insight into the behaviour of parasitoids. Concentrating on reproductive strategies , examples are given from studies on host searching , clutch size and sex ratio. Turning to population dynamics , we show how the incorporation of environmental and biological variability into simple population models of hosts and their parasitoids leads to the prediction of stable associations. This is in marked contrast to earlier, unstable models which assumed homogeneous environments. We also describe recent work on the population dynamics of tropical host! par asitoid systems and the interaction of hosts and parasitoids with insect pathogens. Introduction Insect parasitoids represent one of the major lifestyles on this planet, making up at least 10% of all multicellular animal species. They are recognized by their characteristic life cycle which has aspects in common with that of both predators and parasites. The adult female parasitoids lay their eggs on, in or close to the bodies of other arthropods (usually insects) which are eventually killed by the feeding parasitoid larvae. They are in effect, therefore, predators where the act of 'prédation' involves oviposition rather than direct consumption of the prey. Parasitoids occur in a number of different insect groups, but by far the greatest number are found in the order Hymenoptera, which contains the ants, bees and wasps. Parasitoids can be classified in other ways than by their taxonomie grouping; for Drs Godfray and Hassell are members of the Department of Pure and Applied Biology, Imperial College, Silwood Park, Ascot, Berks SL5 7PY. 531</page><page sequence="2">Population biology of insect parasitoids instance, by the stage of the host life cycle - egg, larvae (nymph), pupae or adult - that is attacked. Egg, larval and pupal parasitoids are all relatively common, but only rarely are adult hosts attacked. Parasitoids that inject their eggs into the bodies of their hosts and whose larvae develop inside the host are known as endoparasitoids , in contrast to ectoparasitoids where the egg is laid on the surface of the host and the developing parasitoid larva feeds through small punctures in the host's cuticle. At the time of oviposition, the female parasitoid normally paralyses the host to allow uninterrupted egg-laying. This may be permanent, the normal case for ectoparasitoids, or temporary as in most endoparasitoids, followed by normal host behaviour despite the host harbouring the seed of its eventual destruction. The advantage of not killing the host is that the parent wasp can attack a host that is currently too small to support the development of a wasp. The host recovers and continues feeding until it reaches a certain size at which the quiescent parasitoid larva starts to grow and the host is soon destroyed. In some species {solitary parasitoids) only one wasp ever develops on a single host, while in others (gregarious parasitoids) more than one, and sometimes as many as several thousand, can develop in one host. Some parasitoids - known as hyperparasitoids or secondary parasitoids - have become specialized to develop on other parasitoids feeding within or on a host. Those that attack with equal readiness another parasitoid or a healthy host are known as facultative hyperparasitoids, while those that have completely lost the ability to attack healthy hosts are obligate hyperparasitoids. A very few tertiary parasitoids (those that attack hyperparasitoids) are also known, while there is one group of parasitic wasps whose females develop as normal parasitoids, but whose males are hyperparasitoids of females of either the same or a different species. Parasitoids vary considerably in the range of types of hosts they attack. Some (monophagous) species are completely restricted to a single host species, while others (oligophagous) are restricted to a group of closely related host species. Wider host ranges are also common and frequently a ( polyphagous ) parasitoid will attack a range of hosts, even if they are not related. Good examples of this are certain parasitoids of leaf-miners (insects whose larvae feed within leaves) which will attack beetle, moth, fly or sawfly hosts, as long as they have the same form of leaf-mine. Parasitoids have been the subject of intensive research for a number of reasons, two of which we shall discuss here: (1) In the last 20 years there has been much interest in the evolutionary significance of animal behaviour, which has prompted much work on the adaptive significance of a range of parasitoid behaviour. (2) As mentioned earlier, parasitoids make up a sizeable fraction of the world's fauna and therefore play an important part in most ecological communities. They have been shown to be important causes of mortality of insect populations, and thus of interest both to population ecologists and to applied entomologists when the host happens to be a pest. Readers interested in research into other aspects of the biology of parasitoids will find a series of reviews in the proceedings of a recent conference on insect parasitoids.24 532</page><page sequence="3">H. C. J. Godfray and M. P. Hassell Behavioural ecology of parasitoíds In this section, we shall focus mainly on parasitoid wasps, which have proved excellent subjects for studying the evolution of behaviour. They are a very diverse group ranging in size from the minute fairy-flies (Mymaridae), some of which are under 1 mm in length and develop in the eggs of other insects, to large and active ichneumons (Ichneumonidae) which parasitize the caterpillars of butterflies and moths. We consider first the location of hosts, followed by the reproductive strategy of a wasp once a host has been discovered. We shall often imply that the wasps are 'deciding' to do something, or to a particular behaviour 'being in a parasitoid's interest'. This does not, of course, imply any anthropomorphic motives on the part of the wasps: such shorthand is often a convenient substitute for rather cumbersome statements such as 'natural selection will act on the wasp population leading to the spread of genes that influence individual behaviour such that. . .'. Searching for hosts Consider the problems faced by a female parasitoid commencing to search for a host. Both host and parasitoid are small animals in a complex environment. Unless the host is extremely abundant, the searching parasitoid is very unlikely to encounter a host simply by chance. The environment does, however, provide a number of clues that may direct a parasitoid towards a host, and natural selection should lead to the evolution of parasitoid behaviour that makes use of these clues. Several examples of how parasitoids search for their hosts are now well understood and illustrate a level of behavioural sophistication that was previously quite unexpected. The most straightforward cues that a parasitoid can use in host location are stimuli emanating from the host itself. A number of parasitoids are known to 'home in on' chemicals secreted by their hosts.17 These chemicals (1) may be deliberately released by the host, as in the sex pheromone of bark beetles which parasitoids use to locate infected trees, or (2) they may be by-products of normal host activities, such as the chemicals present in the salivary secretion and faeces of moths, both of which are often used by parasitoids for host location. They may be volatile substances which the parasitoids can use for long-range attraction, or non- volatile arrestants which result in the parasitoids remaining longer, and searching more diligently, in the immediate neighbourhood. While chemical cues are the most common host stimuli used by parasitoids, other types of stimuli are also used. Visual cues such as shape and movement are used by some species, especially when chemical stimuli lead them to expect a nearby host. The detection of vibration can also give information about the presence of a host. Parasitoids of leaf-miners can detect the movements of their host inside a leaf and the parasitoids of flies living in rotting fruit are also able to locate their hosts by vibration. A very unusual instance of attraction by host stimulus is exhibited by a parasitoid fly 533</page><page sequence="4">Population biology of insect parasitoids that attacks adult crickets. In this case it is the noise made by male crickets that is the attractant.5 In the absence of cues produced directly by the host, some parasitoids use other stimuli in host finding, such as those emanating from a particular habitat or host plant. For example, wild species in the same genus as the laboratory fruit fly, Drosophila , occupy a variety of habitats including fermenting fruit, fungi, rotting leaves and sap runs in trees. Their parasitoids are attracted to the appropriate habitat whether or not it contains flies. Recently, two very similar parasitoid species of drosophilids were distinguished by their different responses to habitat stimuli. Only after this behavioural identification were additional minor, but consistent, morphological differences observed.21 While chemical cues again seem to be the most important stimuli involved in habitat and host plant location, there is evidence from some species that visual stimuli may also play a part. For instance, the parasitoids of insects living in asparagus and hawthorn berries investigate artificial models that appear visually similar to natural fruit.1 The adaptations for host finding in parasitoids discussed so far have all been of the form of constant, inflexible behavioural rules. It has been known for some time, however, that parasitoids can learn from experience. In a classic set of experiments, Arthur3 investigated learning in an ichneumon parasitoid that attacks a wide range of moth caterpillars (including the important pest, the pine shoot moth) living in webbed leaves. Potential hosts were placed in artificial shelters made of crepe paper that loosely mimicked rolled leaves and other caterpillar shelters. Arthur discovered that when presented with two types of artificial shelter, one containing hosts and the other empty, the parasitoids would learn which type was the more profitable and then preferentially search such types in the future. He found that the wasps were able to distinguish between different coloured and shaped shelters, but not shelters with different orientations (vertical versus horizontal). In the wild, the ability to distinguish between different shelters probably allows the wasp to search more efficiently for the most abundant host which might feed on any of a wide variety of host plants. The type of learning displayed by this wasp is termed associative learning - the wasp learns to associate a stimulus with a reward. A second example of learning in parasitic wasps concerns the same parasitoids of Drosophila discussed above. A newly emerged female has the choice of searching for hosts in one of a number of possible habitats, all of which can potentially contain suitable flies. Unfortunately for the wasp, there is much variability in habitat quality in different localities and at different times of year. A simple behavioural rule, search for habitat X, will thus not be universally successful. The female wasp, however, does have one piece of information about the relative value of local habitats: she knows that the habitat in which she emerged contains hosts, or at least contained them in the recent past. Vet and her collaborators22 have shown that some drosophilid parasitoids initially commence searching for habitats similar to those in which they developed. This prefer- ence is overridden in the event of the wasps discovering hosts in alternative habitats. 534</page><page sequence="5">H. C. J. Godfray and M. P. Hassel! Reproductive strategy On discovering a potential host, a parasi toid wasp must make a series of decisions. First, she must decide on whether or not to parasitize that host. For a given species of host, individuals may vary in size and age, and a wasp may be unwilling to waste eggs or time parasitizing a host in or on which its offspring will have a reduced chance of survival. If the parasitoid does oviposit, a second decision concerns the number of eggs to be laid. A large host may support more parasitoid larvae than a smaller one. The final decision is peculiar to parasitic wasps: what sex should the offspring be? All Hymenoptera have a haplodiploid genetic system; the haploid males develop from unfertilized eggs, while the diploid females develop from fertilized eggs. The parent wasp is thus able to determine facultatively the sex of an offspring by controlling whether or not she fertilizes the egg with stored sperm prior to oviposition. Such control over the sex of one's offspring is unavailable to non-hymenopteran parasitoids and to the vast majority of organisms that are diploid in both sexes. A very productive technique for investigating these types of decision-making problems is the construction and testing of behavioural optimality models. The approach rests on the assumption, implicit in the work of all evolutionists since Darwin, that given a series of alternative traits, natural selection will favour the trait that leads to the maximum fitness for its bearer. Fitness is formally defined as the genetic contribution to the future population gene pool, although in practice it can usually be approximated by a quantity that is simpler to measure. In studying reproductive strategies, the number of offspring, or number of grandchildren, is frequently used as a measure of fitness, while in the study of foraging strategies, a very common approximation to fitness is the rate of gain of energy. In the construction of an optimality model, the investigator defines the set of possible traits and the relationship between each trait and the chosen measure of fitness. The investigator then calculates the 'optimal' trait - the trait that leads to the greatest fitness for its bearer - a process that normally involves a mathematical argument. The investigator then observes the behaviour of the animal and sees if the prediction is confirmed. It is very important to note that what is being tested is the investigator's model of the animal's behaviour: the hypothesis about the set of possible traits and the way the traits affect fitness. What is not being tested is the underlying assumption that natural selection maximizes fitness. If the prediction is proved incorrect, the experimenter's model is wrong: in no sense has it been shown that the animal is behaving suboptimally. Consider the problem of whether or not a parasitoid should attack a particular host individual where host size and suitability for parasitism can vary. Suppose that the wasp has a virtually unlimited supply of eggs, but that oviposition is a lengthy, time- consuming procedure. Should the wasp spend time ovipositing on a poor quality host (where the chance of its offspring surviving are low) when this time could be used to search for better quality hosts? The trait we are considering in this case is the range of 535</page><page sequence="6">Population biology of insect parasitoids hosts attacked by the wasp, ranked by quality. The wasp should obviously attack the 'best' host, but should it also attack the next best and, if so, the third best, and so on. Now, if the range of host quality is too small, the wasp spends most of its time searching for a few good hosts and so has a low rate of offspring production. When the host range is too large, the wasp spends all its time ovipositing but many of its eggs die as they are laid on poor quality hosts: again the rate of offspring production is low. The problem is to choose the best intermediate host range. However, if we know the qualities of the different types of hosts and also the length of time it takes to attack each host, a simple mathematical calculation leads to the prediction of the intermediate but optimal host range. (It turns out that the arguments used to predict the range of hosts accepted are structurally identical to those used to predict diet breadth, a subject on which there has been much research, especially by ornithologists, see e.g. Ref. 13.) Experimental tests of these types of host range models are just beginning to be carried out. The models predict that the range of hosts accepted should increase as the best hosts become less common, for which there is now good evidence from several experimental studies.2 The models also predict that the optimal host range should remain unaltered as the abundance of prey types outside the host range are manipulated. This, however, is not supported by the available data, indicating that the models of host searching are at fault. The problem may lie in the assumption that the wasp can identify instantaneously the quality of the host, which is unlikely to be true. Incorporating an 'identification' time brings the predictions into line with the results of experiments. The process of successive prediction, testing and reformulation of the model is typical of this approach to understanding animal behaviour. We now consider the second component of reproductive strategy - clutch size. Once again an optimality model will predict the clutch size an animal should lay. Fig. 1 shows a graphical model of clutch size, that applies to a range of organisms (e.g. birds). A test of this prediction is shown in Fig. 2 where the data suggest a clutch size smaller than that predicted. The assumptions of the model in Fig. 1 imply that the fitness returns from a single clutch are maximized. This is legitimate if opportunities to produce clutches set the limits to the reproductive success of the wasp. However, suppose that hosts are abundant but that the wasp has very few eggs to lay. Selection will now maximize fitness returns per egg, in which case a smaller clutch size is predicted (Fig. 1). In reality both host and egg limitation may be operating simultaneously giving rise to intermediate clutch sizes. Clutch size is an example of a case where the choice of the quantity to be maximized, fitness returns per egg or per host, has a major bearing on the predictions of the model. Seeing if the observed behaviour conforms to one prediction or the other provides useful information about the biology of the animal. The analysis outlined above suggests that solitary and gregarious life histories should be part of a continuum of adaptive clutch size strategies. One difference between the two life histories is that the larvae of solitary wasps very frequently 536</page><page sequence="7">H. C. J. Godfrey and M. P. Hassell Fig. 1. Graphical model for the calculation of optimal clutch size for the case when each clutch can be considered in isolation. The shaded bars represent the fitness of a larvae developing in a clutch of a particular size. In (a), larvae do best when they develop alone and progressively worse as clutch, size increases. In (b), larvae do best in intermediate sized clucthes, those developing in particularly small or large clutches being heavily penalized. As it is the mother who decides what size clutches are produced, the optimal clutch size will maximize her fitness which is simply the sum of the fitnesses of all clutch members. Multiplying the per capita fitnesses (shaded bars) by the clutch size gives the mother's fitness (total height of bars). In both examples given here, the mother's fitness is maximized when she lays a clutch of three eggs which is thus the optimal clutch size. Arguments of this sort were first put forward by David Lack14 to explain clutch size in birds. Note, if the parent is selected to maximize fitness returns per egg, rather than per clutch (see text), the optimal clutch size will be one in (a) and three in (b). (Figure after Godfray.8) possess large mandibles which are used to destroy other wasp larvae present in the same host. Were the parent to lay two eggs in the host, the resulting sibling larvae would fight until only one remained. It is thus clear that selection would have to operate simultaneously on the parent to lay more eggs and on the larvae to stop fighting before a clutch size greater than one could evolve. Analysis of the population genetics involved suggests that once a species has evolved the solitary, fighting life history, it may be very difficult for selection to lead to its reversal. This is an example of a genetic constraint complicating a simple optimality model.9 537</page><page sequence="8">Population biology of insect parasitoids Fig. 2. Tests of optimal clutch size predictions of the type described in Fig. 1 for six species of parasitic wasps. The filled squares represent the predicted clutch sizes and the shaded bars the range of clutch sizes observed in nature. Observed clutch sizes are consistently below predicted clutch size (note logarithmic axis). (After Waage &amp; Godfray. ) Finally, we ask what sex offspring should a female wasp produce. The great evolutionist, Sir Ronald Fisher,7 first provided in 1930 an explanation for the near ubiquity of an equal sex ratio. He argued that in a population with excess females, a mother that produces more males than average would be at an advantage since her sons would then get a disproportionate number of mates. In contrast, if the population were male-biased, a mother would be at an advantage if she produced more daughters since sons would have a disproportionately low reproductive success. Only when the sex ratio is equal will there be no selection for mothers to alter the sex ratio of their offspring. Fisher showed that the relevant sex ratio in these arguments is the sex ratio at conception (or at the end of parental care in some organisms) and that differential mortality later in life does not affect this conclusion. It should be noted that Fisher provided an ultimate reason for the widespread occurrence of equal sex ratios. In practice, equal sex ratios are found in many organisms because of the balanced segregation of sex chromosomes. The importance of Fisher's work is that it provided an evolutionary explanation of why sex chromosome systems that guarantee an equal sex ratio are so common. Fisher's argument is based on a number of assumptions that when violated predict biased sex ratios. The prediction and confirmation of biased sex ratios has been one of the most successful areas of behavioural ecology and much of this work has involved tests with parasitic wasps.6 Fisher's argument assumes in the first place that mating takes place at random amongst the members of the population. Hamilton11 showed that if siblings mate with each other more frequently than expected by chance, a female-biased sex ratio should occur. If all matings take place between siblings, a mother should lay only enough sons 538</page><page sequence="9">H. C. J. Godfray and M. P. Hassell to mate with all her daughters. The explanation for the presence of female-biased sex ratios with sibling mating is rather complex and still the subject of argument today. One way of looking at it is in terms of sibling competition. If one sex competes for a limiting resource more than the other sex, selection should lead the mother to bias her sex ratio against the sex in which the competition is strongest. When mating takes place among siblings, females are the limiting resource and competition only occurs between sons; a female-biased sex ratio is now predicted. (Other examples are known where sons disperse and compete for food with randomly chosen members of the population whereas females remain near the place of their birth where they tend to compete with sisters. In this case, male-biased sex ratios are predicted.) Parasitic wasps frequently attack hosts that are very patchy in their distribution, with typically only one, or a few, wasps managing to discover a patch of hosts. If the wasps of the next generation mate within the patch before dispersal, sibling matings will be common and a female-biased sex ratio should result. Alternatively, if the progeny from a gregarious parasitoid emerge and mate together, sibling mating will again be frequent and female-biased sex ratios should be found. Interestingly, such female-biased sex ratios are widespread amongst parasitic wasps and are found most frequently in circumstances where the probability of sibling mating is high. In the laboratory, it is possible to control the level of sibling mating and to compare the parasitoid sex ratios with the theoretical predictions. Close correspondence between observations and predictions has been found from several of these studies.6 Fisher's second assumption was that environments are homogeneous. For parasitic wasps, this amounts to assuming that all hosts are of equivalent value to male and female wasp larvae. But we have already stressed that hosts frequently differ in size, or in some other measure of quality, and these differences are reflected in the sizes of the wasps that eventually emerge from them. Differences in size should not affect the sex allocation decision of the mother if the fitness of both sexes are equally affected. However, there are good reasons to suppose that males suffer less in fitness loss from being small than do females - small males can probably copulate almost as well as large males and thus mate with as many females. Female fitness, however, is determined by the number of eggs laid, and large females seem able to produce more eggs than small females. Assuming that females suffer disproportionately from developing in a bad host, Charnov6 showed that selection will favour a mother placing female offspring in relatively good hosts and males in relatively bad hosts. This has now been observed in many parasitic wasp species. The theory makes a further stronger prediction: that the correct measure of the quality of a host should be relative rather than absolute. For instance, in a choice between high and medium quality hosts, a wasp should place females in high quality and males in medium quality hosts; in a choice between medium and low quality hosts, female eggs should be placed in medium and male eggs in low quality hosts. Thus, medium quality hosts may get either male or female eggs depending on the other hosts present. Such experiments have been carried out with several wasp species; the results of some have conformed with 539</page><page sequence="10">Population biology of insect parasitoids theory while in others the effect was not observed (review in ref. 6). A possible explanation for the failure of some tests is that the wasp might never have experienced different combinations of host quality in its evolutionary history, and thus would never have been selected to develop the capability of adjusting its sex allocation strategy in this way. Population dynamics of parasitoids From the behaviour of individual parasitoids, we now turn to host-parasitoid interactions at the population level. The two subjects are interrelated since the crucial components of population interactions can often be traced back to individual behaviour patterns.12 In particular, we are interested in whether parasitoids can regulate their host populations at levels below that set by resource-limitation. This question is of fundamental interest to population ecologists interested in the dynamics of natural enemy-prey interactions in general, and also of practical interest since parasitoids are the basis of most biological control programmes that aim to reduce the abundance of pest insects. Let us consider first an interaction between a host and a specific parasitoid that attacks no other host species. Although the majority of parasitoids do attack more than one host species, specialist parasitoids are by no means rare in nature and afford a convenient starting point for understanding the dynamics of host-parasitoid interactions. Our main tool in understanding the range of possible dynamics resulting from parasitism is the development of mathematical population models. Two broad approaches have been adopted. The first takes a specific interaction and aims to build a model incorporating as much as is known of the biology of the system as well as of the environment in which the species live. This tactical approach has the advantage that it can lead to specific predictions on population change under different conditions, something that is obviously important in pest management. A major disadvantage, however, is that the predictions require very detailed observations from the specific system, and do not readily lead to general statements about host-parasitoid interactions. It also often proves difficult to demonstrate just which of the many inputs in the model are responsible for the observed output. An alternative, strategic , approach is to construct minimally complicated models that incorporate only the salient features of the biology of the interaction under study. The predictions of such models have wider generality and are normally easier to analyse and understand. The cost of such abstraction is that detailed predictions can rarely be made about specific systems. The first people to construct strategic models of host-parasitoid interactions were W. R. Thompson, A. J. Nicholson and V. A. Bailey in the 1920s and 1930s. The model of Nicholson &amp; Bailey16 has formed the basis of much subsequent work. The crucial assumptions of the model are that the host and parasitoids have synchronized discrete generations, that the reproductive success of the parasitoid is only limited by 540</page><page sequence="11">H. C. J. Godfrey and M. P. Hassel! its ability to find hosts (i.e. that egg limitation and the time it takes to attack a host can be ignored), and that the search for hosts is random and characterized by a constant searching efficiency, the 'area of discovery'. This gives the model Nt+l = FNtf(Pt) Pi+i = Nt[l - f(Pt)] Here N and P are the hosts and parasitoids, respectively, in generations t and /+1, F is the net host rate of increase per generation and/(Př) is the fraction of hosts escaping parasitism, which in this case is given by f(P,) = exp (- aP,) where a is the per capita searching efficiency of the parasitoids. The model predicts an unstable equilibrium of host and parasitoid around which the populations show rapidly expanding oscillations (Fig. 3). Fig.3. The observed ( ) and predicted ( ) populations from a laboratory interaction between the greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum (•) and the parasitic wasp, Encarsia formosa (o). The heavy lines show the observed populations and the fine lines come from a Nicholson-Baily model with a = 0.068 and F = 2. (From Varley et al.20) 541</page><page sequence="12">Population biology of insect parasitoids It is ironic that Nicholson, who was much concerned with the ways that populations might be regulated, should develop a host-parasitoid model that is unstable. Although some very simple laboratory experiments show results of this kind (Fig. 3), the model as it stands is clearly not very useful in explaining the persistence of host-parasitoid interactions under natural conditions. Parasitoids could, of course, be contributing nothing to the stability of insect populations, in which case natural interactions are only persisting by grace of some other regulating factors. But it is more likely that the Nicholson-Bailey model is deficient and that host-parasitoid interactions can persist without invoking other, additional density dependent processes. Faith in this latter view has fuelled much of the more recent work on the population ecology of host- parasitoid systems. One of the first attempts to increase the realism of this basic model was to incorporate a more realistic functional response. This describes the relationship between the number of hosts attacked per parasitoid per unit time and host density. The Nicholson-Bailey model implicitly assumes that the response is linear; in fact, as host density increases the numbers of hosts attacked by a parasitoid must eventually reach a maximum, perhaps because the parasitoid has run out of eggs, or because it has spent all its available time ovipositing and so is unable to attack further hosts. Limiting a parasitoid's maximum attack rate in this way, however, only further destabilizes the interaction. Only if the functional response is sigmoid in shape can there be any contribution to stability from this component alone, and the effect is usually weak. If parasitoids are to regulate their hosts, other factors must be important. Much of the early theory of population ecology was set in homogeneous environments with uniformly distributed populations where each individual is equally affected by the factors affecting mortality and fecundity. Theoretical population ecology has now largely veered away from this idealized, uniform world, and variability between individuals in populations is now widely regarded as having a most important affect on population dynamics. Thus, in contrast to the Nicholson-Bailey model that assumes each host individual to be identically at risk from parasitism, there are many factors in the real world that will lead to some host individuals being more susceptible to parasitism than others. Some may be better able to mount a haemocytic reaction to parasitoids in their blood stream, some may escape parasitism by being slow or fast developers, some may escape by virtue of their spatial location, and so on. Let us consider, for example, the possible effects of a patchy environment, where the patches are the plants upon which the host insects feed. The distribution of hosts across such patches is typically clumped. The parasitoids, in turn, are likely to be attracted particularly to patches of high host density, responding to the kinds of cues described above. Some patches, therefore, will contain more searching parasitoids than others, leading to different levels of parasitism from patch to patch. It is this differential susceptibility of host individuals to parasitism that is the essential ingredient for heterogeneity to promote the stability of host-parasitoid interactions. 542</page><page sequence="13">H. C. J. Godfray and M. P. Hassell The reason that this heterogeneity in host susceptibility promotes stability can most easily be understood in terms of refuges. If some hosts are protected from parasitism in a refuge, the host population as a whole has a 'buffer' against over-exploitation by the parasitoids. The refuge might, for instance, be a physical refuge (e.g. scale insects on the trunks of Citrus trees are less prone to parasitism, compared to those on the branches and leaves.18 Equally well, however, the refuge effect may arise from any mechanism - physiological, behavioural, developmental, etc. - leading to some host individuals being less at risk than others. The model framework discussed so far is appropriate to specialist parasitoids with discrete generations that are synchronized with those of the host. We conclude by illustrating a quite different framework that is needed when hosts and parasitoids are no longer constrained in this way - they may have several overlapping generations per year and unequal generation times. Such is the situation often found in the tropics. While the tropics are by no means aseasonal, tropical insects are frequently able to breed throughout the year. Host-parasitoid models now need to be constructed in continuous time, rather than with discrete generations. An interesting conclusion from such models is that the populations need not necessarily be stable with all stages overlapping (the expected result); they can also cycle with a period of roughly one host generation interval, and thus more-or-less recovering the discrete generation intereactions described above. Which of these outcomes occur depends largely on the ratio of the lengths of the host and parasi toid life cycles. If the life cycle of the parasitoid is the same, or twice as long as that of its host, then continuous, stable populations are likely as long as there is sufficient heterogeneity promoting stability. If, however, the parasitoid life cycle is 0.5 or 1.5 times that of the host, the populations are more likely to break into the discrete generation cycles (Fig. 4). The basis of this population behaviour can be understood by considering a population at a continuous equilibrium which experiences a short-term increase in the number of hosts. The hosts will reproduce and produce another peak in host numbers one host generation later. The parasitoids will also be able to make use of this increase in host numbers and so produce a peak in parasitoid numbers one parasitoid generation later. Now if the host and parasitoid have equal generation lengths, the host and parasitoid peaks will coincide and the parasitoids will, over successive generations, return the system to continuous generations. However, if the parasitoid has a generation cycle half that of the host, not only will the host and parasitoid peaks not overlap, but the parasitoid peak will cause a trough in host densities and thus tend to promote discrete generation cycles. A further example where age-structure is very important to the observed dynamics is shown in Fig. 5(a). It shows the results of a long-term laboratory experiment in which host and parasitoid fluctuated erratically.19 One obvious interpretation of these irregular patterns of abundance is that they arise from some environmental stochasticity in the system. However, they could also be determined from the internal dynamics of the interaction, as illustrated by some recent work by Bellows &amp; Hassell.4 543</page><page sequence="14">CX 10000) Fig. 4.

(a) The observed population dynamics of the bruchid beetle Callosobruchus chinensis ( ) and its pteromalid parasitoid, Anisopteromalus calandrae ( ), from the laboratory system of Utida.19 (b) The predicted dynamics for the interaction between C. chinensis ( ) and Lariophagus distinguendus (Ptero- malidae) ( ) from the simulation model of Bellows &amp; Hassell.4 They developed a simulation model including the full age-structure of the interacting populations based directly on detailed studies of a laboratory system similar to that illustrated in Fig. 5(a) using the same host species ( Callosobruchus maculatus; Bruchidae) and a closely related species of parasitoid wasp ( Lariophagus distinguendus ; Pteromalidae). The predicted population dynamics (Fig. 5b), using the parameters independently estimated in the laboratory, show not only a persisting host-parasitoid interaction, but also irregular fluctuations. Age-structured population dynamics clearly reveal interesting properties not apparent from much simpler models. 545</page><page sequence="16">Population biology of insect parasitoids Unpredictable fluctuations that are deterministically driven by the interaction itself, as shown in Fig. 5, have been termed 'chaotic'.15 Their existence poses considerable problems to ecologists studying natural populations in distinguishing between population fluctuations that are driven by randomly varying processes (e.g. climate) or by the complexities of the population processes themselves. In general, chaotic fluctuations become increasingly likely as the degree of non-linear density dependence acting on the population(s) increases - for instance, by moving from two-species interactions to systems with three or more species. The emphasis in population ecology has largely centred on the dynamics of single- and two-species systems, divorced from the more complex webs of multispecies interactions of which they are an integral part. Increasingly, however, this emphasis is shifting towards studies on more complex systems with the ultimate aim of determining how population dynamics can influence the structure of simple communities. To achieve this end, it is clearly important in the first place to determine how the dynamics of two interacting species are influenced by the additional linkages typically found with other species in the food web. Interestingly, in several of these systems the dynamics are not just the expected blend of the component two-species interactions. Rather, the additional nonlinearities introduced by additional species lead to quite unexpected dynamical properties. For example, let us consider the case of a host insect with discrete generations attacked by a specific, synchronized parasitoid and also a pathogen (virus, bacterium or protozoan) that is directly transmitted between hosts by a free-living infective stage released into the environment on the death of the infected host. The model combines the continuous production of infective pathogen stages and the continuous mortality of infected hosts within a single host generation, with the discrete, generation-to- generation processes linked with host reproduction and attack by parasitoids (M. E. Hochberg, unpublished). A range of conditions defines whether the pathogen and parasitoid can coexist together on the same host population, or whether only one or the other can persist. Of particular interest is the wide range of dynamics that can occur on moving from two to three species - the addition of the third species (parasitoid or pathogen) may either stabilize the existing two-species interaction, or it may induce oscillatory, or even chaotic, fluctuations depending on the precise combination of parameter values. Conclusion The study of parasitoids has been extremely fruitful in understanding general processes in behaviour and ecology. It has led to the development of basic theories and, to a limited extent, their testing by observation and experiment. The way forward is now to place a much greater emphasis on the closer integration of theory with detailed observations and experiments on individuals and populations both in the 546</page><page sequence="17">H.
