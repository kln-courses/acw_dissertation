Price. $ 38.00 Were's "Lines that Connect" is a bold attempt to rethe orise social life in the Pacific in terms of pattern. This is the kernel of an excellent idea that deserves considerable attention. The book itself, however, fails to live up to its promise. Were begins with the ethnography of Nalik people from New Ireland. In the first section of the book, he ex plores the significance of kapkap, a well-known but pre viously unstudied valuable made up of a white shell disc overlaid with an incised turtle-shell plate. These strik ing objects are in use as items of display and ceremonial throughout island Melanesia in dilferent forms. Surprisingly, kapkap are little understood and Were makes it his mission to explicate what these objects mean and how their patterns are implicated in social life. This takes him on an interesting journey through the history of missionisation and social change experienced by Na lik people since the nineteenth century, culminating in an analysis of Nalik adherence to Baha'i religious prac tice. Throughout, Were attempts to show how pattern has served as a mediator of social relations and a thread of continuity in Nalik social and cultural life. Continuing its exploration of pattern and social change, the book then turns to consider how indigenous Melanesians co-opted and made use of imported cloth during the colonial period. Were argues that Melanesians did not simply imitate European clothing, nor did they passively respond to missionisation, but actively appropri ated textiles to their own purposes. Finally, Were turns to his other field site in Tonga, where he analyses develop ments in Tongan women's corded textiles such as crochet. One of the main failings of this book is that it is sim ply too short for everything that it attempts to undertake. This is Were's first single-authored monograph and curi ously, he uses the opportunity to make a cross-cultural analysis of artworks rather than to develop either of the two ethnographic projects that he has undertaken in detail. The exploration of kapkap alone would merit a book of twice this volume's 180 pages. Unfortunately, in a book of this length, Were inevitably proceeds through sugges tion and assertion rather than patient ethnographic expo sition. Similarly, the discussion of colonial Melanesian history and Tongan textiles are too brief and in the former case almost wholly speculative. Conceptually, "Lines that Connect" is rather a muddle. At the heart of this book is a very good idea: that human life might be rethought in terms of patterns. Pattern is, as Were points out, fundamental to a vast range of human ac tivity. Indeed, drawing on the geometric logic of patterns - their potential to engender new patterns through their own transformation - Were suggests how the idea of pattern as a relational form might come to supplant the notion of culture, which he regards as founded on difference rather than relations. It is in this guise that his claim that pat tern is a "meta-media" is most convincing - an assertion that he bases on Alfred Gell's now famous discussion of Marquesan designs in "Art and Agency" (Oxford 1998). The fruitfulness of this idea is immediately apparent. The location of pattern in geometry and the logic of math ematical operations offers to make of pattern what LÃ©vi Strauss made of incest. That is, pattern might serve as the form to bridge the gap between logical and social rela tions as the geometry of patterns passes from the leaf and the snail-shell to barkcloth and shell valuables. Indeed, this is clearly what Were intends, when he suggests that pattern, because of its geometric logic "transcends any specific incarnation" and therefore (he cites Piaget) plays a role in the formation of specifically human intelligence. The remainder of the book, however, does not live up to this headline promise. Central to the argument regard ing the Nalik material is a formal exploration of kapkap. Were draws on Gell's analysis of Marquesan patterns to suggest that the patterns of kapkap can logically be gen erated from one another. He suggests that the "prototype" Anthropos 107.2012</page><page sequence="2">316 Rezensionen pattern is an anthropomorphic form. However, as with so much in this book, there is not enough material: this cen tral discussion is contained in some half a dozen pages and leaves the impression of a gesture towards Gell rath er than an actual analysis. Moreover, the artifact Were analyses and which shows the anthropomorphic pattern he dwells on is admittedly unusual: recognizable figures are not a normal feature of kapkap. Puzzlingly, the an thropomorphic nature of the design then vanishes from the analysis, to be replaced by the vague assertion that so cial relations and designs are cognate or analogous forms. This problem is compounded by a sloppy definition of what constitutes a pattern. In his introduction, Were suggests a number of examples of patterns, which fo cus on plastic and graphic arts and performance. Yet hav ing invoked pattern as a logical meta-medium, these and the concrete examples in the remainder of the text seem needlessly prosaic. It is unclear (and unexplored) what separates a humanly created pattern showing a "trace of consciousness" from a naturally occurring one, such as a crystalline formation - or where this line might be blurred, as in the mathematical models that he also al ludes to. Indeed, there is no mention of language, or of the pattern which necessarily forms a part of all intelligible acts, beyond a passing reference to Benedict. Shying away from these issues, the text often aban dons a deeper exploration of pattern to focus rather nar rowly on objects which are rather unproblematically "pat terned" in a limited sense - although it does reserve a stronger use of the term to incorporate ideas and argu ments that would otherwise fall outside its schema in a weaker version. Hence, where his argument is strongest and most interesting, Were is concerned with the idea of pattern as a geometrical figure whose logic implicates it in other patterns, both extant and potential. However, at other points in the text, pattern appears simply as a deco rative feature of objects. Hence, chapter 6 is concerned with transformations of clothing across Melanesia and chapter 7 discusses in novations in Tongan textiles. In both these chapters, the fact that the objects in question are patterned appears to be rather incidental - certainly "pattern" does not oper ate at a conceptual level to integrate the argument. In deed, while the objects in question do indeed mediate so cial relations in extremely interesting ways, there is no evidence that they are able to do this because of the pat terns that they embody. Rather, pattern is subjected to a familiar cultural analysis of appropriation and resistance. Some conceptual role for pattern is hinted at in the con cept of a "pattern system." However, this term remains unexplained, is not listed in the index and must be under stood as a placeholder for culture - unfortunate consid ering the notion of pattern was introduced as a means to displace heuristics of difference. The result of all this conceptual confusion is that Were's book suggests a powerful, indeed compelling con ceptual framework which is unfortunately at odds with much of the material he wants to cover. A great deal of that material is extremely interesting and would merit fur ther publications. It is therefore sincerely to be hoped that this disappointing volume represents the beginning of a longer programme of research and publication to develop the obvious potential of its component parts.
