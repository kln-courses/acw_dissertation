<plain_text><page sequence="1">214] Recent Literature Bird-Banding productivity, and management of sage grouse in Idaho," by P. D. Dalke and others in therefore timely. The population studied was highly mobile, moving 13-27 miles to brood range from strutting grounds, and 30-50 miles to winter range, for an annual round trip of 50-100 miles. Counts of strutting cocks, and brood censuses in early July, are useful. Sex, age, and reproductive criteria are discussed. These latter points are also considered in the other two papers. The final two papers are reviews "Disease and infection in the Tetraonidae," by C. M. Herman. cautions against the tenacious assumption that a single "grouse disease" is a cause of grouse mortality, and calls for new tools and techniques to attack problems in wildlife diseases. Gardiner Bump's "History and analysis of tetraonid introductions into North America," recounts unsuccessful attempts to stock capercaille, black, hazel, and willow grouse. He also makes a case for the possibility of successfully introducing the first two species, though without con- sidering possible effects on native species. The symposium is closed by an ex- cellent evaluation of the constituent papers by Frederick and Frances Hamer- strom, who served as its assistant editors. Those wishing informative summaries of the contents should turn here first. In such a heterogeneous array of contributions it is not possible to point out minor errors or points of disagreement in individual papers and I shall make in- stead only a few general comments. The photographs do not indicate sex of the birds illustrated, and in some cases this is not evident by inspection.. Usage of common names is somewhat confusing; in some papers both racial names (ex. dusky, sooty grouse) and species name (blue grouse) are used. Finally, a more representative survey of work currently in progress might have been possible had a longer time (say, several years) been allotted to assembling the contributions. This is said in full appreciation of the difficulties faced by editors of such a sym- posium, but a better volume could have resulted from the elimination of certain minor papers and the inclusion of more reviews and major papers. It is to be hoped that The Wildlife Society will continue to publish symposia, and in the future more frequently than once every ten years.-Robert S. Hoffmann. 53. Argen the Gull. Franklin Russel. 1965. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. New York, 239 pp. 9 photographs by the author, 1 map (the coast of Atlantis or per- haps Shangri-la). Price $4.95 Mr. Russell is a fine professional writer but he reminds me of the so-called Very Important Persons who came to Japan during the American occupation for a visit of five days or perhaps five weeks. When they returned to the United States, they felt qualified to write a book about Japanese life and thought. It is possible after a brief visit to describe superficially Japanese geisha girls, a shrine, and Fujiyama, but not even after five years of daily associa- tion with Japanese in their homes would a student of far eastern mores feel com- petent to write of Japanese life and thought. Franklin Russell dares to put thoughts and emotions into a Herring Gull's brain and heart that a lifelong student of animal behavior would hesitate to presume existed. He has even endowed Argen the Gull with the ability to dream. Mr. Russell makes a very exciting story of the evolution of gulls and the life of a Herring Gull from egg to senility. In his first chapter he introduces a theory new to science when he suggests that perhaps feathers developed to keep primitive birds warm and were later found useful for flight. The book contains some factual Herring Gull behavior, probably adopted from Tinbergen's The Herring Gull's World. Certainly much of the story of Argen's first mating came from the section entitled "The Formation of New Pairs" in that fine work. But Russell takes no notice of Tinbergen's theory that can- nibalism among gulls occurs only in overcrowded colonies. If one can overlook scientific inaccuracy, anthropomorphism, and the author's over-active imagination, Argen the Gull may be labeled "Leisure Time Reading." The pictures are more "Art Photography" than bird illustrations. The jacket design is pleasing.-Elizabeth S. Austin. 54. Rare and Exotic Birds. Robert Cushman Murphy. 1964. The Odessy Press, New York. 45 pp., 75 color photographs by Arthur Singer. Price $0.95. This beautiful little book is a delightful combination of the lesser known abilities of two very gifted men. Robert Cushman Murphy, outstanding as a scientist, demonstrates his fund of bird folklore and his gift for story telling. Arthur Singer,</page><page sequence="2">Vol. XXXVI Notes and News [215 1965 outstanding as a bird artist, demonstrates his ability as an exceptionally fine nature photographer. The text links together sound science, ornithological anec- dote, and little-known legend to hold the interest of the reader who is less inter- ested in birds than an ornithologist. The pictures amply illustrate Dr. Murphy's last sentence, a quote from Dr. F. M. Chapman, "Birds are Nature's most eloquent expression of beauty, joy, and freedom."-Elizabeth S. Austin. 55. Bird Songs / Adventures and Techniques in Recording the Songs of American Birds. Norma Stillwell. 1964. Doubleday and Company, Inc., Garden City, New York. xix + 194 pp. Price $4.95. An attractive tale of 12 years and 180,000 miles of travel throughout the IT. S. by the author and her husband, the late Jerry Stillwell. After his retirement, the Stillwells became ab- sorbed with recording bird songs in the wild, with the encouragement of Peter Paul Kellogg and others at Cornell. The high quality and wide variety of the results led to a series of commercial records, which were praised by reviewers and have given a great deal of pleasure to their public. This is not a technical treatise, though the author does comment on such matters as trying to record songs clearly by a babbling brook. It does convey the enthusiasm and enjoyment the Stillwells derived from the project, and the sheer hard work involved. I had the pleasure of meeting the Stillwells early in their journeys (over some buff-bellied humming- birds in the Rio Grande Valley), and of receiving Jerry's characteristic brief post- cards with pointed comments on their later travels. From one standpoint, the book is a vivid illustration of the possibilities of a second career after retirement. From a broader standpoint, few of us accomplish this much in a full career, much less in 12 years.-E. Alexander Bergstrom. NOTES AND NEWS We note with regret the death of Lawrence Boylston Chapman on May 13, 1965, at the age of 78. He was professor emeritus of marine transportation and marine engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His services to NEBBA included a term as president from 1941 to 1948. He contributed major papers to Bird-Banding on Tree Swallows, based upon his colony of the species at Princeton, Mass. Many NEBBA members will recall pleasant and informative field meetings at Princeton. Effective with this issue, printing costs of Bird-Banding have risen somewhat. We intend to absorb this increase within present membership and subscription rates. However, now more than ever we need the help of readers in recommending the journal to others who maight enjoy it. Because of this increase in printing costs, the price of whole copies of an issue to authors, when ordered in advance, is now 40c each, including postage within the U. S. Prices for separates of papers or notes are still as shown in the July, 1963 issue. Favorable comments from users of type H nets (30mm mesh, otherwise like type A in specifications, and like type C in price) continue to reach us. One sizeable station comments: "On the whole, I think they are excellent. They seem to be equally good for catching warblers as well as thrushes, tanagers, etc. I did see one or two warblers slip through, but these were the exceptions . . . Some larger birds were caught but quite a few got away, i.e. robins, blue jays. All things considered, I think that they can and should be the net type used where small birds are predominant." Another user comments: "30mm. seems to be just right for warblers, especially yellowthroats. My experience has been that when they are caught in 36mm. mesh they are usually extremely tangled, otherwise they go right through." Another large station comments: "We used a lot of the 1 1/2" [36mm.] nets last year and our final totals really showed the difference; we had many more of the larger birds (thrushes, catbirds, etc.) but fewer warblers, hum- mingbirds, etc., so we've decided to go back to the smaller mesh [30mm.] in most of our lanes." These experiences confirm that no one net size is effective for all sizes</page></plain_text>
