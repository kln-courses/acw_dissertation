<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SCIENTIST'S BOOKSHELF Views and Reviews by Kirtley F. Mather, Harvard University Science in Progress, Eighth Series, edited by George A. Baitsell; xiv + 285 pages; 103 figs.; $6.00; Yale University Press, 1953. Scientific American Reader, edited by Gerard Piel, et al; xiv + 626 pages; illustrated; $6.00; Simon and Schuster, 1953. Each of these books is a collection of authoritative articles by outstanding scientists who are personally respon sible for significant advances in our understanding of the world we live in and of ourselves as part of that world. Each contains much information of real value to every citizen of the modern world. Each gives true insight concern ing the way in which contemporary scientists are pushing outward the frontier of knowledge in many direc tions. Each is a demonstration of the vitality and diversity of scientific re search. There are, however, many differences between the two volumes. Science in Progress is the eighth in the now well established biennial sequence in which authoritative reports of active research areas in the sciences are published. Its rather lengthy and well-illustrated ar ticles are based on material presented during the last two years in the Sigma Xi National Lectureships and at the national conventions. Although con taining much that is of interest to the layman in science, its target is the sci entist who is alert to what is going on in other fields than his own, rather than the "man in the street." On the other hand, the Scientific American Reader is a completely new venture. It brings together in book form fifty-seven articles that have ap peared during the last five years in the magazine which has so effectively filled "the gap between the specialized jour nals of the professional press and inci dental coverage of science in the general press." Few of these articles are more than ten pages in length, and the num ber of illustrations is comparatively small. Most of the articles report inde pendent work by the different authors, each of whom is a distinguished special ist in some field of scientific research. A few chapters were written by profes sional writers working in close collabora tion with scientists. All are adeptly co ordinated into a smoothly flowing se quence by apt comments, skillfully composed by unnamed members of the "editorial board." The aim is ob viously to make the book appeal to all readers who have "a lively and intelli gent interest in science," whether or not they happen to have any special training in any of its subdivisions. It is interesting to note that the ten chapters of Science in Progress extend over almost as wide a range of mate rial as do the twelve sections of the Scientific American Reader; and also that both books begin with an article by George Gamow on the origin and evolu tion of the universe in space. The many scientists who have contributed to these volumes deserve praise and gratitude for their acceptance of the responsibility of aiding in the wider dissemination of knowledge as well as in its acquisition. Both books are worthy of high com mendation. The Reader may have more appeal for the general public; but the eighth volume of Science in Progress, although primarily of interest to pro fessional scientists, has a special per manent value for layman and scientist alike. Added to the previous seven volumes of this series, it makes available a veritable encyclopedia of modern sci ence to the fortunate possessor. 143</page><page sequence="2">144 AMERICAN SCIENTIST Amazon Town by Charles Wagley; xi + 305 pages; 8 line drawings; $5.00; The Macmillan Co., 1953. lt?, is the fictitious name of a little town in the lower Amazon Valley in Brazil, first visited in 1942 by the author, but the book is based mainly "on data collected from June to Sep tember 1948, during the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization Amazon survey for the International Hylean Amazon Insti tute." Mr. Wagley, his wife, and Brazil ian assistants entered completely into the life of the village, held long inter views with all sorts of people and col lected case histories of 113 families. From these contacts emerges a lively book on the tropical way of life, fused from the American Indian and Portu guese cultures during the last three cen turies, which Margaret Mead considers "a study of uniformly high quality." The physical aspects of the town and its relation to its surroundings are de scribed, the origin of the people is traced and their history related, with some space devoted to the "rubber crash" and its consequences. The reasons for the town's "backwardness" are analyzed. Ways of making a living in the trop ics, and social relations and family af fairs in an Amazon community provide material for two long chapters. "From Magic to Science" demonstrates how entrenched traditional benefits still hold back scientific knowledge, al though with constantly lessening in fluence. "The main factors which make for the difference between those com munities which furnish only a bare minimum existence and those which provide more amply for human needs are, in a broad sense, social and cul tural. . . . The contemporary society and culture of such communities as I ta are the product of [the] historical proc ess." For improvement there must be not only a new technology but social change on many fronts. "It is to be hoped that a new Amazon culture will be formed combining the productive powers of modern technology and sci ence and the efficiency of modern in dustry with the many positive values of the present way of life." The Making of a Scientist by Anne Roe; ix + 244 pages, illustrated; $3.75; Dodd, Mead &amp; Company, 1953. The Making of a Scientist presents to a popular audience the results of a three year psychological study designed to assess the relationship between success in scientific vocations and the life his tories and personality structures of 64 eminent biologists, physicists, psycholo gists, and anthropologists. The major part of the author's investigation con sisted of an analysis of life histories and various personal data obtained by in terview, together with the results of Rorschach studies, Thematic Appercep tion Tests, and a Verbal-Spatial-Math ematical Test especially devised for the group by the Educational Testing Serv ice. In a subsidiary study the Rorschach was administered as a group test to 382 additional scientists. Some expected and some rather sur prising patterns of data were obtained, of which only a few may be enumerated here. About half the scientists studied were sons of fathers belonging to the professions; many were oldest sons or an only child. Many of them tended, even when young, towards attitudes of isolation and independence, though this was less true for the social scientists than for the natural and physical scien tists. The results of the Rorschach study showed biologists to be preoccupied with form, physicists with three-dimen sional space and inanimate motion, so cial scientists with people. The social scientists were found more deeply con cerned about human relations than either of the other two groups; the phys icists exhibited greater anxieties than the biologists. A study on the predomi nance of visual versus verbal imagery suggested a relationship to the type of science practiced, and also to paternal professions. Drive and intensive interest</page><page sequence="3">BOOKSHELF 145 in their subjects characterized all groups. The author herself raises the question as to the degree to which some of her findings are related to success itself, rather than success in science in partic ular, and one would wish to compare similar data obtained from comparable groups who devote their energies to other intellectual pursuits. While mod ern statistical methods affirm that valid distinctions can be drawn between groups numbering less than two dozen members each?that is, the size of the groups used by the author to represent physical, biological, and social science? the numbers seem small to warrant con clusions concerning the central problems of intellectual superiority. But although present methods of testing and analysis fall short of answering the still unanswer able questions as to the primary factors determining the creative process, the results already obtained will prove of considerable interest to scientists and laymen alike. Readers of the American Scientist who are interested in the study itself would be well advised to turn to the more technical publications for its con tent, since the mode of presentation in this volume leaves something to be de sired. The author's technique is to de scribe the aims of the investigation, its methods, its results and their interpre tations, through the device of relating her own personal and professional ex periences while carrying out the tests. The text is extensively written in the first person, which in itself might be no defect. But it degrades itself in content, style, and even grammar ("If I could not get the subjects the study was a bust"; "I showed the blot to Chico, our poodle, who is the only other person anywhere near. He was very naughty about the whole thing and a little insulted") in an apparent attempt to bring the material down to the level of the lay reader. The more technical portions of the text, which have escaped transposition to colloquialism, prove to be the most readable, since they follow the first of the cardinal rules for success fui popular exposition, that is, they re spect rather than belittle the intelligence of the reader. Dr. Roe is to be com mended for her decision to describe psychological research in subjective terms, but it is a pity, particularly in view of the great inherent interest of the material presented, that she has mis judged the key in which to compose her theme.?Jane Oppenheimer. Puritan Sage: Collected Writings of Jona than Edwards, edited by Virgilius Ferm; Library Publishers, 1953. Edwards speaks for himself in this volume celebrating the 250th anniver sary of his birth on October 5, 1703. An acute observer whether of spiders, rain bows, or revivals; diagnostician of the varieties of religious experience a century and a half before William James; orderly recorder of all he saw and thought; nat uralist, pastor, philosopher, and theolo gian, Edwards rewards the reader. Dr. Ferm's introduction is concise and in clusive. No other selection of Edwards' works will be necessary for a generation. The title, Puritan Sage, is a theorem: Edwards was a sage because he was a Puritan. The Puritan college which reared him insisted on the unity of all knowledge. Edwards incarnated this belief and refused to truncate himself, his experience, or his world. The physics of Newton, the logic of Locke were the best tools his reason could use to answer the intermediate questions with which science wrestles; he used them magnifi cently. With equal gusto and skill he used philosophy and theology for the ultimate questions only they can answer. Is there any other way for a scientist to become a sage??David Nelson Beach. Man, Time, and Fossils. The Story of Evolution; by Ruth Moore; xvii + 411 pages; index, xiii pages; illustrated; $5.75; Alfred A. Knopf, 1953 Man, Time, and Fossils represents a newspaperwoman's attempt to report the story of human evolution to a lay</page><page sequence="4">146 AMERICAN SCIENTIST audience. It is divided into three por tions; the first describes the development of the modern concepts of evolution and heredity from Darwin and Lamarck through to Haldane, Fisher, and Wright; the second discusses the finding of the fossil remains relating man to the other anthropoids; the final section considers the problems of human evolution which arise in consequence of the recent dating of the past by fluorine and carbon-14 techniques. The book is beautifully constructed and illustrated, and the story, although somewhat sensational ized, is written both lucidly and plau sibly. It is therefore particularly unfor tunate that its argument is in many ways highly misleading. In the first section, after taking up the concepts of Darwin, Lamarck, Giard, Cope, Mendel, and DeVries, the author jumps next to the statistical studies of Haldane, Fisher, and Wright. The names of Morgan and his co-workers and of Goldschmidt are never men tioned; the very brief discussion con cerning mitosis, meiosis and cytoge netics is incorporated into the chapter on Haldane in such a way as to suggest that he performed single-handed all the great accomplishments of classical ge netics. The second section of the book is as distortedly selective as the first, and the final section fares little better. Here, where modern theories of popula tion-genetics might well have been recon sidered, there is no mention of Simpson's theories on the tempo and mode of evolu tion; instead, to the experiments of Wash burn are attributed a weight which it is difficult to believe that time will support. If the importance of a single genetic change can be as great as the author seems to believe, it is a pity that her own dominating mutation has been that for starry-eye rather than vision-in perspective; a moral of her book is that "the" missing link between newspaper reporter and scientific investigator is yet to be evolved.?Jane Oppenheimer. The Primitive City of Timbuctoo by Horace Miner; xx + 297 pages; $5.00, Princeton University Press, 1953. Although the word "science" is not in the vocabulary of Timbuctoo, this study of the primitive city is filled with scientific data gathered in 1940 by a com petent American sociologist during seven months of residence in and about the city. The book is highly commended to any reader, and for the student in particular it will greatly enlarge his total view of primitive culture. The city is full of Arabs, Tuareg no mads, and Negro tribesmen, each group observant of its somewhat peculiar cus toms (even the Arabs with their higher Islam are near the primitive level), and each group still resistant to the ways of "civilization." This reviewer, a comparative religionist, long a student of Islamics, has found the book richly rewarding, although there is a paucity of knowledge of Islam on the author's part. The book, however, does represent vividly the contrast between the higher Muslim and the lower primitive cul tures. Muslim law, for example, pre vailed for many hundreds of years be fore the French Catholic conquest, and Islam has continued to be the core of religion as observed in Timbuctoo, whatever its adaptation to local custom. Many native rites are observed in Al lah's name, although all of them should not be attributed to Islam, as the au thor seems to do at times. For the extension of his knowledge of primitive culture in these modern days, any reader, nevertheless, will be grate ful. There is heterogeneity still in Tim buctoo, despite the long mingling of various cultures and the prevalence of the Muslim calendar for yearly observ ance of special days and rites. Chapter 13 with its 27 pages on "Patterns of Conflict" will be of special interest to any reader. The book is an excellent de scriptive study of a too generally un known region of the earth; its descrip tions have recourse to intimate details faithfully recited.

Newton Friend; ix + 354 pages; 4 plates, 14 figs.; $6.00; Charles Scribner's Sons, 1953. Originally published in England a year ago, this encyclopedic account of man's manipulations of the chemical elements, "from stone-age hearth to the cyclotron," is now available in an Amer ican edition. It is a notable contri bution to the history of science, with its emphasis upon the discovery of the various elements and the progressive steps that have been taken toward their industrial application. Mingled with the important data concerning each element are many interesting historical side lights. Dr. Friend's great erudition is permeated with humanity and humor. Adrenal Cortex. Transactions of the Fourth Conference November 12, 13, and 14, 1952, New York, N. Y., ed ited by Elaine P. Ralli ; 165 pages; $4.00; The Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation, 1953. The contents of the Transactions of the Fourth Conference on the Adrenal Cortex include a verbatim transcript of an informal group discussion on the permissive action of adrenal cortical hormones, and three prepared addresses: "Mechanisms through which the ad renal cortex produces qualitatively dif ferent effects," by Hans Selye; "Exist ence, nature and site of production of a salt hormone (mineralo-corticoid) se creted by the adrenal gland," by Marthe Vogt; and "Adrenalectomy in man," by F. D. W. Lukens. The three papers present interesting statements of pr ogress within the fields they cover through 1952. Each of them is followed by a complete transcript of the ensuing discussion. The verbatim re ports of what the volume calls "group interchange" are highly enlightening when the comments made are relevant. They are unfortunately not always equal in this respect, and there is some question as to the value of reproducing every word when not every word is to the point. "Who shall decide when doctors disagree, And soundest casuists doubt, like you and me?"?Jane Oppenheimer. Ferroelectricity, No. 1, Investigations in Physics by E. T. Jaynes; edited by Eugene Wigner and Robert Hof stadter; 142 pages; $2.00; Princeton University Press, 1953. Although ferromagnetism is one of the oldest known phenomena in physics, its electrical analogue was only discov ered in 1917, during the investigation of the piezo-electric properties of Rochelle salt. Since then, this property of spon taneous polarization in a certain tem perature region (ferroelectricity) has been discovered in other materials, and has led also to many practical applica tions. Barium titanate is one of the most interesting ferroelectrics since it has a far simpler crystal structure than Roch elle salt. Its properties were discovered independently in various parts of the world during the World War II, and most of the theories which have been developed have been tested in connection with the properties of barium titanate. After a historical review, the author discusses the various theories which have been developed to account for fer roelectricity, and then gives a detailed discussion of the electronic theory first proposed by E. P. Wigner in 1949 and further developed by the author in some detail. This monograph is of interest not only to the theoretical physicist but also to the experimenter, because of the comparison between theory and experi ment, and the discussion of experiments which may decide between the various theories. The book contains a large amount of information ; the bibliography goes to December, 1951.?Karl Lark Horowitz. Social Behaviour in Animals with Special Reference to Vertebrates by N. Tin bergen;</page><page sequence="6">148 AMERICAN SCIENTIST xi + 150 pages; 67 test figures and 8 plates; $2.50; Methuen &amp; Co. Ltd. and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1953. Biologists who center their interest on the living organism as such rather than on its chemical and physical consti tution have taken encouragement re cently from the liveliness of the move ment in Europe and England which is cur rently applying itself to the study of animal behavior. It is the purpose of this movement to analyze, by observation and experiment, specific types of be havior in terms of innate responsiveness to definite external stimuli. Its partici pants recognize that each aspect of a particular form of behavior, whether this is itself a reaction of response or a type of behavior which stimulates or releases a response in some other organism, has some biological significance; and their goal is to investigate and interpret this significance 'naturalistically" without recourse to anthropomorphism. As the author has put it elsewhere, "the be haviour of animals puzzles many of us even more than our own behaviour." It is the even-more-ness that constitutes a challenge to ingenuity and insight: ingenuity to detect what part of the structure of an organism or what phase of the organism's behavior acts as a cue or releaser for the reaction of another organism; insight to ascertain to what degree particular types of behavior are affected by factors internal as well as external to the organism. Tinbergen's book, one of the Methuen Monographs on Biological Subjects, deals with the function, causation, and evolu tion of social behavior. Specifically, it examines, from the point of view outlined above, four types of social cooperation in animals: mating behavior, family behavior, group behavior (including re lationships between different as well as the same species), and fighting. It then describes some of the ways in which various species organize these four types of cooperation, and finally discusses some evolutionary aspects of social behavior. In the conviction that the amateur can contribute much to the science of animal sociology, the author has addressed to him a chapter at the end on method. He has succeeded, in his whole text, in presenting his ma terial sufficiently clearly to be intelligible to the layman; and at the same time, he has included enough hard data and interpretive argument to be able to expound summaries of his own particu lar hypotheses to specialized profes sionals. The book contains a bibliography of well over a hundred titles; a special word must be added for the illustrations, which are delightful. To interpret behavior in terms of stimulus and response is clearly no new approach, no matter how the stimulus and response are named and defined. If the uniqueness of the present investiga tors' contribution is their endeavor to accomplish this unanthropomorphically, twin questions are raised: the first, as to the degree of their success; the second as to the validity of the premise from which they proceed. It is true that the dominating trend through the whole his torical development of science has been the gradual emancipation of thought from anthropocentric influences; but may it not be precisely in the realm of animal behavior that clues to the or ganization of biological pattern may be derived from inward speculation? And if these are frankly recognized for what they are and interpreted honestly and judiciously might they not be exploited to the advantage rather than the detri ment of science, particularly in fields bor dering so closely on the psychological? In essence, is not precisely this one of the accomplishments of the new science of ethology for which Tinbergen is one of the eloquent spokesmen? Could Lorenz ever have appreciated the significance of imprinting if he had never known a mother? Are not mating and fighting, as types of social cooperation in animals, activities intelligible to Tinbergen through the intuition he inherits as a member of a species which mates and fights? The point about anthropomor phism may not be that it is to be shunned in itself, but that it requires to be stripped of the sentimentality which so (Continued on page 150)</page><page sequence="7">BOOKSHELF (Continued from page 148) often surrounds and imbues it, and here is where the new ethology makes its most considerable contribution. But wholly aside from its present ition and interpretation of actual facts, this book has two primary importances for biology in general. It reminds the modern biologist of a lesson he rarely remembers, that he still has much to learn from sheer observation, or at least from Observation and Reflection. And it re-emphasizes again, in the most forceful terms, what is probably the most significant generalization for the whole of biology, namely, in the words of the last sentence in the book, that "the animals themselves are always more important than the books that have been written about them."?Jane Oppenheimer. Explorations in Science by Waldemar Kaempffert ; vii + 296 pages; $3.50; Viking Press, 1953. One of America's ablest science writers demonstrates in this book the fine art which he and others of his craft have developed in recent years. Each special ist in science is a layman in at least a few of the more distant fields of re search, and he who writes "for the lay man" is writing for scientists as well as bankers, salesmen, and members of the reading circle in a women's club. I am sure that Mr. Kaempffert was well aware of that fact as he assembled and revised for this book the numerous articles which he had penned in the last eight years. Certainly he took every pre caution to check his material with the numerous scientific advisers in his large circle of friends. Certainly, also, he has succeeded "in letting fact dominate romantic speculation." The thread that ties together the twenty chapters, each a unit in itself, is simply the novelty of the otherwise dispa rate explorations into the unknown. But one senses the fact that it is not just the discoveries of basic research that are in triguing; it is the application of the new knowledge for human welfare that lures 150 the author. Thus he probes the minds of research scientists, in every field from nuclear physics through aerodynamics to malignant diseases, to ascertain not only how they are progressing toward the solution of their problems but also what will be the probable or possible impact of their discoveries upon the life of man. Infancy and Childhood, Transactions of the Sixth Conference, March 17 and 18, 1952, edited by Milton J. E. Senn; 160 pages; $2.50; Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation, 1953. A distinguished group of pediatricians, psychiatrists, and child psychologists assembled at the Conference on Problems of Infancy and Childhood recently held in New York under the auspices of the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation. Verba tim reports of the speeches delivered at the conference and transcripts of the group discussions following each paper make this little volume lively reading. Except for "A Brief Review of World Health Organization Activities" by Knut Kjellberg, Regional Health Officer in the field of maternal and child health, the papers read at the conference are centered around the emotional problems of the first year of life. Dr. Anne Stewart, of the University of Washington Medi cal School, reports on her study of ex cessive crying in infants, which has been carried out for the past two years in the Child Health Center on the campus in Seattle. This study has recently re ceived considerable notice in the press. Dr. Katherine Wolf's "Observations of Individual Tendencies in the First Year of Life" is a report on "a small part of a research project" undertaken by a group of child psychologists at the Child Study Center at Yale. She frankly states: "I shall leave out all theory," and presents two case histories which illustrate her findings. A particularly interesting paper, "Emotional Development in the First Year of Life," is by Dr. Sibylle Escalona, an assistant professor at the Child Study Center at Yale who has recently been appointed executive officer of the Social Research Foundation's fund for re search in psychiatry.

"The difference be tween the two emphases," says Dr. Escalona, "is that when the interaction principle is taken seriously, very dif ferent constellations of circumstances can lead to very similar interaction proc esses and hence to similar behavior." Dr. Escalona's spirited defense of her ob servations, when pressed by her medical and psychiatric colleagues regarding the use of such terms as "communication" and "anxiety," is an illuminating side light on the theoretical limitations which tend to restrict, or even re-evaluate, clinical observations in the field of human behavior. 152 Problems of human development in the first year of life are beginning to be recognized as of vital importance in all aspects of social behavior. The diffi culties inherent in observing the speech less and vegetative human infant, es pecially in relation to his devoted and often too articulate mother, are obvious. The many ingenious methods now being used to surmount such difficulties, and the account of the trials and errors of individual observers reported in these papers, offer the reader an interesting insight into the actual process of as sembling and evaluating the data upon which future hypotheses in the field of child development may be based.

New knowledge concerning clay materials has been re cently secured by many investigators, approaching the numerous difficult problems from diverse points of view. He himself is widely recognized as among the foremost mineralogists to direct research into this long-neglected phase of mineralogy. Never before have the widely scattered data been as sembled, organized and integrated to present their nature and significance in a unified and inclusive monograph. The information it contains is funda mental to many phases of the work of petroleum geologists and engineers, stratigraphers, soil scientists, construc tion engineers, and even paper manu facturers. There could scarcely be a better 154 demonstration of the dependence of geologists upon the tools and concepts provided by physicists and chemists. Not until the electron microscope had been developed could there be such important information as that which it reveals. X-ray diffraction data are extremely valuable in the identification of clay minerals, but the technique was made available only a few years ago. The physical properties of clay mate rials are commonly dependent to a large extent on the exchangeable ions carried by the clay minerals, but it was not until chemists had developed the principles of ion exchange that the exchange capacity of the different clay minerals became really useful in their study.

The inclusion of a number of the physical methods of analysis adds little to the real value of the book. Fourteen of these methods are covered in only twenty-one pages, and the treatment of each method is too brief to do more than remind the analyst that such methods exist. Like the first edition, this is an out standing reference book of chemical separations and determinations. The theory, practice, and applications of tried and tested analytical procedures are presented in a very comprehensive manner. This book is recommended without reservations to those chemists interested in applied inorganic analysis. ?H. C. Harrison.

This book not only meets the needs of the investigator already familiar with the theory and practice of ion exchangers, but it should awaken the interest of those investi gators not familar with the field. Its title is somewhat misleading in that the material presented goes far beyond the somewhat limited sphere often associ ated with the analyst. The historical introduction is a brief and interesting review of the earlier developments in the field. The theo retical presentation adequately covers such topics as fundamental properties of ion exchangers, ion exchange equilibria, ion exchange kinetics, and the theory of column operation. The sections on techniques of ion exchange separations and ion exchange chromatography con tain all the information necessary for the beginner to apply these methods in investigations. The section on applica tions includes specific examples of the use of ion exchangers in such fields as inorganic analysis, inorganic colloids, organic chemistry, medicinal chemistry, toxicology, biology, biochemistry, high polymer electrolytes, trace element analysis, and the purification and recov ery of analytical reagents. The appendix contains important information regard ing commercially available ion ex changers, while the author index is unusually complete for so small a monograph.

The ex planation of the formulae appears to be entirely adequate for those having some familiarity with the subjects involved. Occasional references have been made to books and articles where more ex tensive treatments and tabulations may be found, but no attempt has been made to present an extensive bibliography. The book contains no tabulations of mathematical functions.?William Di ment. Physics by Noel C. Little; viii + 648 pages; tables, figs.; $6.00; D. C. Heath and Company, 1953. This textbook is designed for an intro ductory course in college physics. It is intended to meet the requirements of both students concentrating in science and students seeking only an introduc tory knowledge of physics. The mathematics used in the body of the text is limited to elementary algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. Some derivations using the calculus are pro vided in a short appendix. The exposi tion is clear and was obviously prepared by an experienced teacher well ac quainted with the problems of intro ducing students to physical concepts. The organization of the text departs from the traditional approach. The first part introduces the concepts of length, time, force, electricity, and temperature. Five fundamental phenomena (ener getics, flow phenomena, field phenom ena, periodic phenomena, and quan tum phenomena) form the basis for the divisions of the second part. In adopt ing this grouping, fundamental theories and interrelations receive additional emphasis. The book covers a wider range of topics than most introductory physics texts. In addition to the usual topics, there are chapters on subjects such as the kinetic theory of gases and the special theory of relativity. Numerous problems (with answers) and discussion questions accompany each chapter.? William Diment.

This textbook, designed for an intro ductory course in solid state physics, is primarily intended for graduate stu dents in physics, chemistry, and engineer ing. A good undergraduate background in physics is assumed. Some acquaint ance with quantum mechanics is help ful in reading portions of the text. Several advanced topics are developed in an appendix. The more fundamental aspects of solid state physics are discussed, but the breadth of the field requires the omis sion of numerous topics. Thus, such subjects as surface physics, thermoelec tricity, piezoelectricity, and molecular crystals are not considered. Several chapters, particularly "The Classification of Solids and Crystal Structures" and "Elastic Constants," serve only as introductions. Magnetic phenomena receive considerable atten tion. The bibliographies accompanying each chapter are not exhaustive but appear to be very much up to date and provide an adequate starting-point for further study. Exercises for the student accompany each chapter.?William Di ment. Microwave Spectroscopy by Walter Gordy, William V. Smith, and Ralph F. Trambarulo; xii + 335 pages; 40 tables, 95 figs.; $8.00; John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1953. That the newest member of the spec troscopic family has come to full man hood is evidenced by this treatise, the first book on microwave spectroscopy. In their preface, the authors state that "one of the aims...is to provide for microwave spectroscopists, chemists, physicists, and other scientists a con veniently available source of the large amount of very precise information which has been obtained to date through microwave spectroscopy." This objective they have surely achieved. 166 In the first chapters, the components, instruments, methods, and electronic; techniques of the new science, are clearly and carefully explained, well illustrated and diagrammed. Later chap ters on the spectra of gases, the Stark and Zeeman effects, the spectra of solids and liquids, nuclear properties, includ ing quadrupole and magnetic moments, maintain the same high standard of excellence. The sixty-eight page appendix con tains the latest data on magnetic quadrupole moments, molecular rota tional constants, molecular dipole mo ments, nuclear quadrupole coupling, nuclear moment, molecular structures, and Zeeman coefficients. These are ap propriately cross-referenced to a fine bibliography, and help to make this a valuable contribution to the field.? Arthur L. Quirk. The Fungi.

This textbook presents in a condensed form the morphology and phylogeny of the organisms that are classified as fungi according to the modern concept. Bacteria or slime molds are not included, except that parasitic slime molds are considered to belong to the primitive fungi. Lichens are not treated. Four classes of fungi are recognized. The Archimycetes, termed primitive fungi, comprise the families Olpidiaceae, Syn chytriaceae, Plasmodiophoraceae, and Olpidiopsidaceae. The Archimycetes are probably degenerate flagellates that have become parasitic and are charac terized by a naked vegetative body. The Phycomycetes, Ascomycetes, and Basidiomycetes are the true fungi with hyphae enclosed normally by cell walls. Keys are given to the orders, in some instances to the families, and in the rusts and smuts to the genera.

It is important to realize what this monograph is, as well as what it is not. The author has no intention of reviewing or compiling the literature on the physiology or bio chemistry of Euglenae, which is increas ing at such a rapid pace these days, nor is she interested in giving a classical account of the history of these flagel lates (for example, references are not made to Leeuwenhoek's 1674 letter or to Harris' 1696 paper). On the other hand, she has succeeded admirably in the difficult, self-assigned task of criti cally considering the extensive litera ture on the taxonomy and morphology of members of the genus and incor porating it, for the first time, into a single, compact treatise.

Interest in the avifauna of Mexico has been growing prodigiously during the past decade, but the absence of a field manual for the identification of the 1000 species which occur within the country has been sorely felt. To ornithologists, professional and amateur alike, the publication of this handy volume is a welcome event. A brief description is given of every species of bird known to occur in Mexico, whether as a resident, transient, or visitant. The distribution in Mexico of each species, and of any races, is briefly outlined. Under every species is a sec tion entitled "Remarks" in which there is a wealth of data on breeding, migra tion, habitat, etc. Keys, based on field marks, are given for the larger families, which although not always fully satis factory should enable one to identify at least 95 per cent of the species without difficulty. Skillful line drawings by D. E. Tibbetts are helpful.

These two volumes, written by a number of physicists each an authority in his special branch of nuclear physics, 174 constitute an excellent review of the main results obtained in this rapidly growing field up to the end of 1951. Because of the tremendous expansion of nuclear physics, it is impossible for one person to be an expert in all of its specialties. Accordingly these much needed volumes had to be a collabora tive effort, and Dr. Segr? is to be con gratulated on his fine editing work which has produced a satisfying unification of the separate discussions. This is not a popularization of the subject. The authors have written for the serious students and research work ers in nuclear physics. Included are up-to-date discussions of experimental techniques and valuable selections of the significant facts and data. The general ideas and important formulas of the theoretical interpretation are men tioned for each topic, and there are a number of good tabulations of impor tant nuclear constants, such as nuclear moments, nuclear reaction Q values, and isotopic weights.

Bainbridge concludes Volume I with a discussion of charged-particle dynamics and optics, relative isotopic abundances of the elements, and atomic masses. Volume II is devoted to a survey by P. Morrison of nuclear reactions of all kinds, including of course nuclear fis sion, and a complete review by B. T. Feld of all the important work with neu trons. There is to be a Volume III. These volumes are so authoritative and useful that all students of nuclear physics will find it necessary to consult them. They are a fine example of the great value of a timely and fairly com plete survey of investigations in a very active research field.?W. W. Watson.</page></plain_text>
