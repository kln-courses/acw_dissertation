KAIL Hume's 'Natural History of Religion' offers a naturalized account of the causes of religious thought, an investigation into its 'origins' rather than its foundation in reason'. Hume thinks that if we consider only the causes of religious belief, we are provided with a reason to suspend the belief. I seek to explain why this is so, and what role the argument plays in Hume's wider campaign against the rational acceptability of religious belief. In particular, I argue that the work threatens a form of fideism which maintains that it is rationally permissible to maintain religious belief in the absence of evidence or of arguments in itsfavour. I also discuss the 'argument from common consent', and the relative superiority of Hume's account of the origins of religious belief. I. INTRODUCTION Does Hume's The Natural History of Religion (1757, hereafter NHR) present a threat to the rationality of religious belief?' Since Hume elsewhere targets the epistemic acceptability of religious belief, leaving only a 'true religion' so vacuous in its contents and consequences that it is scarcely a religion, it would not be surprising if NHR contributed to that campaign. Indeed, William Warburton, an early critic, thought that NHR aimed 'to establish naturalism, a species of atheism'.2 But this is not the prevalent view. NHR presents itself as a psychological-cum-historical account of the 'origin in nature' (NHR Intro., p. 33) of religious belief. This, for many, makes it 'essentially a sociological enquiry'3 or predominantly 'a work of scholarship from which general factual conclusions emerge'.4 It has therefore attracted only a fraction of the attention lavished on Hume's other writings on religious 1 Page references are to T.L.

The few who consider NHR as a threat to the epistemic rationality of belief argue that it is an ineffective weapon (see Webb; Yandell); and one commentator holds that this alleged ineffectiveness implies that Hume cannot even have intended it as an attack on religious belief. Thus Lorne Falkenstein (p. 4) argues that Hume 'did not consider [NHR] to have any significant role to play in the broader critique of genuine theism prosecuted in his other works'. The prevalent view is incorrect. NHR is a philosophically important and powerful component in Hume's campaign against the rationality of religi- ous belief. It addresses a form of rationalfideism, according to which religious belief is rationally acceptable even when lacking positive evidence or argu- ments in its favour. Though he offers formidable attacks on arguments purporting to give positive reasons in favour of the belief, Hume is thought not to address those who think religious belief can be rational in this permissive sense.6 I argue that NHR does attack this position. §II of this paper outlines key aspects of NHR and its threat to fideism. §III shows how NHR's account of the origin of religion is superior to the alternatives. §IV briefly considers NHR as a response to the argument from common consent. II. ORIGINS II.I. The explanandum in NHR NHR distinguishes two issues for religious belief, its 'foundation in reason', and its 'origin in human nature'. Of the first, Hume says 'The whole frame of nature bespeaks an intelligent author; and no rational enquirer can, after serious reflection, suspend his belief a moment with regard to the primary 5 Recent discussions include A.

KAIL principles of genuine Theism and Religion' (NHR Intro., p. 33). I shall con- sider this puzzling claim presently, but religion's 'foundation in reason' is not the ostensible concern of NHR. The book investigates the causes or 'origin in human nature' of religious belief. But what is meant by 'religious belief' and its 'origin'? NHR does not attempt to catalogue the different ways by which token psychological states of religious belief are fixed or caused in particular thinkers. It ignores too many obvious kinds of causes, like preachers, parental teaching, an experience interpreted as conversion, or wonder at the beauty of the universe. Instead, its explanandum is the content or idea com- mon to any religious belief (the core content), namely, the notion of 'invisible intelligent power'. Hume treats this as a necessary and (for the most part) sufficient condition of any religious belief,7 writing that this notion is 'the only point of theology, in which we shall find a consent of mankind almost universal' (NHR IV, p. 44). He seeks to trace the emergence of this core con- tent in human psychology. This content is common to any form of religious belief. It first emerges in a form of polytheism, a belief in many invisible intelligent powers. NHR also explains how this belief in many invisible intel- ligent powers becomes transformed into belief in a single one. But it is this core content which is NHR's primary explanandum. Before continuing, I need to guard against a misunderstanding. Else- where Hume appeals to causes in order to differentiate between kinds of religious belief, namely, the 'false' religions of superstition and enthusiasm and the philosophical 'true' religion.8 The beliefs differ in the way in which God is conceived, a difference explained by their causes. Superstitious belief conceives the deity as malevolent, and is causally explained by fear and melancholy, biasing the subject's conception of God. Enthusiasm involves the passion of hope, and generates courage and a conception of the deity as personally inspiring. Both are false, in as much as they involve biased con- ceptions of the deity determined by passions. True religion is monotheism, determined by the operation of unbiased reason. As I shall show, NHR's causal explanation of religious belief makes much use of fear, the passion associated with superstition, and ignores hope and reason as possible causes. Falkenstein, finding the absence of any discussion of enthusiasm 'genuinely perplexing' (p. 7), and noting the emphasis on fear, concludes that NHR is only an explanation of superstition, and not of religious belief per se. This is 7 There is a complication with the sufficiency condition: NHR IV implies, contrary to all the suggestions elsewhere, that polytheism sometimes amounts to a belief in elves and fairies, resembling atheism more than monotheism. See Baier, 'Hume on Religion', pp. 68-9. 8 See Hume, 'Of Superstition and Enthusiasm', in E.F. Miller (ed.), David Hume: Essays, Moral, Political and Literary (Indianapolis: Liberty Classics, 1985). For the contrast between the true and the false, see Dialogues XII. © 2007 The Author Journal compilation C 2007 The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly</page><page sequence="4">UNDERSTANDING HUME'S NATURAL HISTORY OF RELIGION 193 one reason why Falkenstein thinks Hume does not intend NHR as an attack on religious belief per se. This is a mistake. What NHR seeks to explain is how people originally started to think in terms of invisible intelligent powers. This core content is a complex idea, readily intelligible in virtue of its constituents, something that the imagina- tion could conjure up; and it does not obviously violate any restrictions on meaning, nor face combinatory obstacles. So, qua possibility of coherent thought, there is nothing puzzling about the core content (Hume's scep- ticism about the idea of power is absent in NHR). The imagination, though, can combine contents to produce innumerably many novel complex con- tents which never gain currency (the idea, say, of flying rats in swimming trunks is semantically impeccable, but is not the object of debate, dispute, belief or concerted denial). In order for this complex idea to become the object of speculation, belief or denial, rather than simply an idle daydream, the content must emerge in an original form of belief, and I shall display Hume as appealing to fear in order to explain this original form of belief, a polytheism of malign invisible intelligent powers. But having emerged in this original form, the core content can subsequently figure in different forms, including monotheism of various sorts, true philosophical religion, or enthusiasm, all fixed in the attitude of belief by causes other than fear. Fixed by hope, the belief is that of benevolent invisible intelligent power; fixed by reason, the belief is the philosopher's conception of invisible intelligent power. Without an account of the initial emergence of the content, however, there would be no notion of invisible intelligent power with which reason, hope or faith could work. 11.2. Rational destabilization: what NHR examines the origins in human nature of the core content of any religious belief in a form of polytheism, and its subsequent transformation into monotheism. Hume (NHR XV, p. 87) concludes his investigation thus: The whole is a riddle, an xenigma, an inexplicable mystery. Doubt, uncertainty, sus- pence of judgment appear the only result of our most accurate scrutiny, concerning this subject. But such is the frailty of human reason, and such the irresistible con- tagion of opinion, that even this deliberate doubt could scarcely be upheld; did we not enlarge our view, and opposing one species of superstition to another, set them a quarrelling; while we ourselves, during their fury and contention, happily make our escape, into the calm, though obscure, regions of philosophy. This is intriguing; commentators, however, have had little, and little satis- factory, to say about this 'enigmatic' conclusion. Gaskin (p. xxvi) suggests that Hume holds that the 'real content of the beliefs is ... confused and obscure', but does not expand on this. Yandell ('Hume on Religious Belief, C 2007 The Author Journal compilation © oo007 The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly</page><page sequence="5">194 PJ.E. KAIL p. 114) suggests that Hume thinks we can temporarily escape the natural propensities responsible for religious belief, but that this at most shows that suspense of judgement is possible, not that it is the only 'result of our most accurate scrutiny'. Webb (p. 144) reads this as the outcome of Hume's rhetorical strategy: by showing that monotheism grew out of polytheism, Hume connects 'sober' orthodoxy with 'frivolous' vulgar polytheism. Why this implies doubt is not made clear, partly, I suppose, because Webb sees the strategy of NHR as 'engaging our affections' rather than as offering a genuine argument. Baier, in 'Hume on Religion', appears to hold that NHR brings the suspense of belief because it embodies the self-reflection of re- ligious sentiment; but it is obscure how this move is supposed to recommend suspending belief. The three important points in this conclusion are as follows. First, the only conclusion of the investigation is suspension of belief. I shall say that the account 'rationally destabilizes' belief concerning the content it explains (I explain this below). Secondly, it is difficult to maintain the suspension in the face of contagious opinion. Thirdly, we should escape the contagion by turning to philosophy. I concentrate here on the first. That 'scrutiny of this subject' commands deliberate doubt or suspense of judgement suggests that suspending judgement is a normative consequence of the scrutiny. The account provides a reason for suspending belief, a point reinforced by the remark that doubt is the only result of 'scrutiny of this subject'. Since NHR's 'subject' is the origin of religion in nature, it may seem that Hume is expressing dissatisfaction with his account of its emergence (religion is 'inexplicable'). But this cannot be right. The doubt fostered by 'the scrutiny of this subject' is undermined both by the 'frailty of human reason' and the 'contagion of opinion'. If reflection on the cause of religious content meant that we should suspend judgement about Hume's explanation, we are left with the absurd conclusion that frailty and contagion would restore our confidence in a philosophical theory. The suspense of judgement must apply to the explanandum, and not to Hume's explanation of it. The account, in showing the origins of the core content for religious belief, pro- vides a reason to suspend beliefs employing this content. Since this content is necessary and sufficient for any religious belief, the suspense in doubting applies to all religious belief. This provides the 'rational' element of what I called rational destabiliza- tion. Understanding the origins of the core content of religious beliefs provides a reason to suspend them. The account destabilizes them, because although we are provided with a reason to suspend belief in invisible intel- ligent power, it does not follow from this that the belief cannot be justified in some other way. NHR's subject is the 'origin in nature' of religious belief, C 2007 The Author Journal compilation C 2007 The Editors of The Philosophical jQuarterly</page><page sequence="6">UNDERSTANDING HUME'S NATURAL HISTORY OF RELIGION 195 and not the alleged 'invincible reasons' that provide its 'foundation in reason'. If you consider the origins of the core content of the belief alone, independently of its 'foundation in reason', you have reason to suspend it. How Hume's account provides this reason is examined presently. The first question to ask is why this should be a significant conclusion. 11.3. Rational destabilization: why NHR provides a reason to suspend religious belief which does not rest on showing that there are no positive grounds in favour of it. That is to say, the reason to suspend the belief does not depend on attacking the soundness of some argument in favour of the belief or showing there is no evidence in its favour. The reason to suspend the belief stems instead from a correct under- standing of its causes, which is quite independent of the 'invincible reasons' in its favour. Because of this, the account threatens the position that it is rational to maintain religious belief in the absence of evidence or of argu- ments in its favour. I shall call this position 'rational fideism'. As Popkin showed,9 the early modern revival of scepticism went hand in hand with a fideist conception of religious belief as independent of positive reasons in favour of it, a view championed by Montaigne, Bayle, Huet and others. Detailed versions of fideism vary considerably, ranging from Ter- tullian's heroic embrace of the belief because of its absurdity to the moderate view that it can be epistemically permissible to maintain a belief without having to be in possession of positive evidence for it. Clearly Hume's NHR cannot respond to versions that reject any and all considerations of ration- ality, but then no philosophical assault could. The version of fideism I have in mind I shall call 'rational fideism', and it rejects W.K. Clifford's claim that it is 'wrong always, everywhere, and for every one, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence'.10 It holds that one can be a rational agent while maintaining religious belief in the absence of any reasons or evidence which speak in its favour. This view is given modern articulation by, among others, Alvin Plan- tinga" and Robert Audi,12 though different versions display detailed and subtle articulations and differ among themselves. Audi, for example, takes faith to be a psychological state distinct from belief, and talks of rational 9 R.H. Popkin, The History of Scepticism from Erasmus to Spinoza (Assen: Van Gorcum, 1960).

KAIL faith, whereas Plantinga thinks in terms of belief. But both distinguish the rationality of religious commitment from the availability of evidence or argument. Audi writes that I can have 'rational faith ... even when I have little evidence' (p. 219). Plantinga in 1983 argues that a believer can be 'entirely within his epistemic rights in believing in God's existence even if he has no argument or evidence at all', and that we need not think that a 'theist must have evidence or reason to think there is evidence' in order to be rational ('Reason and Belief in God', p. 30; my italics). Plantinga disavows the term 'fideist' because he construes fideist belief as consciously set against reason. 'Why', he asks, 'is it not entirely ... right, proper and rational to accept belief in God without any argument or evidence whatsoever?' (p. 39). In earlier work, his answer is foundationalist. A range of religious commitments are non-inferential, properly basic beliefs, providing a foundation for the beliefs inhabiting an inferential superstructure. For any justification to accrue to the superstructure, the agent must be 'justified' or 'within his epistemic rights' in accepting a basic belief. The notion of 'justified' here is permissive: broadly, one is rational in a permissive sense when, among other things, one is responsive to demands such as consistency, and appropriately responsive to evidence against the belief. Basic beliefs may have grounds, but it is im- portant not to confuse these with evidence or reasons. Perceptual grounds are experiences which confer justification without figuring in propositions which are contents of arguments or reasons. With respect to religious belief, Plantinga appeals to a generalized religious disposition, analogous to Calvin's sensus divinitatis, to ground the beliefs (p. 8o). Later, 'grounds' and 'foundations' give way to more externalist notions of 'proper function' and 'warrant', where the Calvinist instinct is given a teleological twist.13 But these notions are entirely different from the thesis that there must be evidence or arguments in favour of the belief, of which the subjects must be in possession if they are to be rational. For Plantinga, believers can be rational when they are in possession of no evidence, or can offer no argu- ment in favour of their belief. NHR threatens such positions, however articulated or detailed, simply by providing a reason to suspend religious belief which does not rest on merely showing that no positive justification is available for the belief. If fideists acknowledge that Hume's account is the best explanation of religious belief, they therefore have a reason to suspend the belief. NHR completes Hume's campaign against the rational acceptability of religious belief: Hume attacks not only arguments in favour of the belief, but also the general position that one can be rational and continue to believe without evidence. 13 See Plantinga, Warrant and Proper Function (Oxford UP, 1993). C 2007 The Author Journal compilation C 2007 The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly</page><page sequence="8">UNDERSTANDING HUME'S NATURAL HISTORY OF RELIGION 197 Reading NHR as targeting fideism also explains two features of the text. First, there is the injunction of the final sentence to maintain suspense of judgement and to turn to philosophy; secondly, there is the presence of otherwise puzzling allusions to 'invincible reasons' for 'genuine theism'. These jointly constitute an invitation to examine the arguments. For though Hume frequently says there are arguments or invincible reasons, he never gives them. There are, instead, statements of conclusions, claims that the evidence supports these, or else anaemic allusions to general considerations. We are told (NHR Intro., p. 33) that 'the whole frame of nature bespeaks an intelligent author', which is no argument for theism except in a formal sense: the evidence supports theism, therefore theism. Again, 'A purpose, an intention, a design is evident in every thing.... The uniform maxims ... throughout the whole frame of the universe ... lead us to conceive this intelligence as single and undivided' (NHR XV, p. 85). This is more a statement of a conclusion than a concerted argument. The closest thing to a stated argument is en- tangled in his claim that the rise of monotheism is not caused by a grasp of these 'invincible reasons'. An ordinary thinker will 'never mention the beauty of final causes' and 'will not hold out his hand, and bid you contemplate the suppleness and variety ofjoints in his fingers' (NHR VI, p. 52). But again this is not a statement of an argument but an allusion to one. Any reader recognizing the force of NHR further recognizes that the belief now requires positive justification, calling for enquiry into these 'in- vincible reasons' in the calm waters of philosophy. Such a reader is also unlikely to be satisfied by promissory notes and oblique allusions to 'invincible reasons', especially since it is Hume making the allusions. His notoriety in religion was sufficiently established by 1757 for such claims to sound alarm bells. So the reader now must turn to examine these 'reasons', reasons which we know Hume undermines elsewhere. II.4. Rational destabilization: how I now turn to Hume's explanation of the core content and of how his account destabilizes religious belief. NHR begins with the conjecture that pre-religious thinkers (a) lack knowledge of all but the most obvious natural regularities, and (b) are consumed with the pressing business of survival, such as where the next meal might come from and when the drought will end. Meeting these needs is sometimes a life and death matter, success de- pendent on predicting and manipulating nature. Early humans, however, are ignorant of the causes of the natural events upon which they pin their hopes and fears, and so are incapable of predicting or manipulating them. This makes for a psychologically intolerable situation. The passions 'are kept in perpetual alarm by an anxious expectation of ... events' (NHR III, p. 40): © 2007 The Author Journal compilation C 2007 The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly</page><page sequence="9">198 P.J.E. KAIL We hang in perpetual suspence between life and death, health and sickness, plenty and want; which are distributed amongst the human species by secret and unknown causes, whose operation is oft unexpected, and always unaccountable. These un- known causes, then, become the constant object of our hope and fear. The anxiety generated by this situation triggers and sustains an independ- ently established disposition to anthropomorphize, a 'universal tendency among mankind to conceive all beings like themselves, and to transfer to every object, those qualities, with which they are familiarly acquainted, and of which they are intimately conscious' (NHR III, p. 40; cf. Treatise I iv 3). It is from this situation that religious belief emerges in its first form. The disposition manifests itself in the guise of primitive polytheism, wherein there are multiple invisible intelligent powers controlling events. This belief checks the anxiety such thinkers feel. And on similar principles, polytheism is transformed into monotheism. The pantheon is modelled on human social order, where one god is picked out as prince or supreme magistrate, be- coming the central target for the believers' hopes and fears. As these become more extreme, more flattery is directed towards the chosen god, his attributes being increasingly magnified. The end-point of the process is a God conceived as infinitely powerful, all-knowing, and perfectly benevolent. Thinkers 'coincide, by chance, with the principles of reason and true philo- sophy; though they are guided to that notion, not by reason, of which they are in a great measure incapable, but by the adulation and fears of the most vulgar superstition' (NHR VI, p. 54). The core content then emerges through the causation of belief. To show how the account destabilizes, I need to distinguish between epistemically vindicatory, neutral and destabilizing belief sources. Vindicatory sources are those awareness of which putatively justifies belief. Neutral sources are those awareness of which neither adds to nor detracts from the epistemic standing of the beliefs they cause. Destabilizing sources are those awareness of which provides a reason to suspend beliefs thus sourced. 'Awareness' signals both a grasp of the belief's origins and a judgement concerning those origins' epistemic credentials, which are linked to but not identical with its reliabil- ity. In vindicatory accounts, one's awareness of a belief's cause involves a judgement of its epistemic reliability, which in turn constitutes a reason for the belief. Suppose I forget how I came to believe that Atherton played for Cambridge, and am reminded that Edmund, a cricket expert, told me so. Independently of other considerations, awareness of the reliability of the belief's source, not its reliability as such, lends epistemic support. Neutral sources tell neither in favour nor against the belief. I learn that Fred told me, but I have no idea whether he knows anything about cricket; here, learning C 2007 The Author Journal compilation © 2007 The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly</page><page sequence="10">UNDERSTANDING HUME'S NATURAL HISTORY OF RELIGION 199 the origins of my belief does not affect my belief's standing one way or the other. But learning that I acquired this belief from a habitual liar destabil- izes my belief, for I come to learn that I acquired the belief from a source I have a strong reason to mistrust. I thereby have a reason to suspend the belief if nothing else speaks in favour of it. Hume's account of the origin of religious belief appeals to a source that is of this third type. What fixes and sustains the disposition to anthropo- morphize, expressed in the belief of invisible intelligent power, is a conspir- acy of anxiety, ignorance and the passions. Roughly, the belief is acquired because it removes our anxiety. But, as Hume writes in 'Of the Immortality of the Soul', all 'doctrines are to be suspected which are favoured by our passions' (Essays, Moral, Political and Literary, p. 598). We can reconstruct Hume's grounds for suspicion by reference to what David Pears calls motivated irrationality.14 Here, belief-fixing, understood as acquisition and/or sustenance of belief, is irrational, in as much as the cognitive processes governing belief are not appropriately responsive to evidence or reasons, or indeed are biased against evidence or epistemic reasons. This failure is motivated, in as much as it is brought about by the believer's non-epistemic attitudes, desires and evaluations. Believers believe because it suits their desires or interests, rather than because of any evidence or epistemic reason in favour, or indeed in spite of evidence to the contrary. Alice believes Edmund is faithful, despite what would otherwise be salient evidence to the contrary. Edmund 'works late' too often, takes mysterious phone calls, hides his credit card bill, and often smells of perfume. She is blind to salient evidence to the contrary (she refuses to acknowledge the lipstick on his collar), fails to seek evidence to the contrary (she will not look in his pockets), rationalizes, in the bad sense of the word, the evidence ('I must have lipstick of that colour somewhere ... '), or fails to draw inferences which the evidence otherwise suggests. Since Alice is not generally epistemically incompetent, why she believes what she does is puzzling. But we can explain why she con- tinues to do so: because the awful truth is just too awful for her, her desire interferes with her epistemic processes so as to hide it from her. Awareness of such causes provides a reason to suspend the belief, because rather than being vindicatory or merely neutral, such causes work against the epistemic aim of belief, namely, representing correctly how things stand in the world. This aim (truth) is subverted if the mechanisms that infix belief are biased, in an effort to avoid what the evidence would otherwise suggest. We go for the belief despite the evidence, or the lack of it. No epistemically rational agent can endorse a belief which is produced or sustained by a 14 D. Pears, Motivated Irrationality (Oxford UP, 1984). C 2007 The Author Journal compilation C 2007 The Editors of 7he Philosophical Quarterly</page><page sequence="11">200 PJ.E. KAIL source biasing belief against its very aim. Knowing that my belief has such a source provides a reason for me to suspend it unless and until some posi- tive justification is provided. Any belief that is so produced is to be suspected because of the general unreliability of its source. Such bias is central to the emergence of religious belief, on Hume's account. The anthropomorphic disposition is manifested in the formation and maintenance of belief because holding this belief palliates the anxiety pre- religious thinkers feel in the face of their situation. Religion does not emerge as solely a disinterested conjecture about unknown sources, nor do fear and ignorance motivate merely theoretical enquiry.'5 Instead, belief emerges directly from, and is sustained by, the relief it offers from the anxiety generated by ignorance, fear and impotence. It offers an intelligible model for the unknown causes, and importantly promises a way to manipulate those causes, removing the powerlessness that ignorance engenders. Gods, being like humans, are open to flattery, bribery and persuasion; and so thinkers can do something about our wretched state. We have 'recourse to every method of appeasing those secret intelligent powers, on whom our fortune is supposed entirely to depend' (NHR III, p. 42); and again, As the causes, which bestow happiness or misery, are, in general, very little known and very uncertain, our anxious concern endeavours to attain a determinate idea of them; and finds no better expedient than to represent them as intelligent, voluntary agents, like ourselves; only somewhat superior in power and wisdom (NHR V, p. 51). It is because the core content of religious belief is explained ultimately by motivated rationality that the account destabilizes. But matters are not straightforward. If it were true that each and every token religious belief- state had such causes, all thinkers would have a reason to suspend their belief simply in virtue of the causation of their psychological states. But of course it is simply implausible to think that each state is fixed thus. I could agree that the very idea of invisible intelligent power only came into circula- tion because of such irrationality, but quite reasonably disagree about the proximate cause of my own belief. So the reason to suspend belief cannot rest in the particular psychologies of present-day thinkers. Instead, the reason to suspend belief applies to such states because they deploy essentially the core content which is ultimately sourced in motivated irrationality. For the content comes into circulation because of the formation of an orig- inal form of belief, namely, superstitious polytheism. This, again through a process of motivated irrationality, transforms itself into monotheistic belief. Of course, my use of the content depends on more immediate sources in the social environment - parents, teachers, books and so on - rather than on 15 Pace Herdt, Religion and Faction in Hume's Moral Philosophy, pp. 171-2. © 2007 The Author Journal compilation © 2007 The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly</page><page sequence="12">UNDERSTANDING HUME'S NATURAL HISTORY OF RELIGION 201 the psychological operations described in NHR; and so one's thoughts about God are not derived immediately from motivated irrationality. But pointing to a proximate or immediate cause pushes the question back: whence did our parents and teachers get the notion? Unless some other originating explanation for the content can be found, we are returned to Hume's. Our present beliefs therefore deploy a content originating in a source which no epistemically rational agent can endorse, and the requirement for justifica- tion is transferred to present beliefs via knowledge of the irrational origins of the content it deploys. Until and unless an alternative explanation, superior to Hume's, is offered, all groundless beliefs employing such contents are destabilized in virtue of their use of that content. A final point: NHR's genetic approach is on all fours with Hume's investigation into the origins of ideas in the Treatise. Indeed, I have shown elsewhere that NHR perfectly mirrors the structure of Treatise I iv 2, 'Of Scepticism with Regard to the Senses', which itself offers a destabilizing causal account of belief.16 But this general parallel between NHR and the Treatise hides a difference. In the Treatise the discussion of origins tends to concern the simple constituents of thought, the origin of ideas in sensory impressions. Awareness of origins can throw doubt on the representational legitimacy of some idea: for example, the idea of power has its origin in a feeling of compulsion or a 'customary transition', making it difficult to see how this idea can represent what is 'in the objects'. NHR, unlike the Treatise, is not concerned with the possibility and legitimacy of the simple constitu- ents of thoughts, but with the genesis of a complex idea and its fixing as a belief. No worries are voiced concerning whether the idea represents, or whether we can mean anything by the terms 'God' or 'gods', and Hume's general scepticism about the notion of power is ignored. So although considerations of origins can offer reasons for disquiet in both texts, they nevertheless offer different kinds of reason, one concerning the represen- tational legitimacy or otherwise of some idea, the other the rationality of maintaining belief in the light of the origin of its content. III. COMPETING ACCOUNTS III. 1. Neutrality, priority and historicity NHR explains the emergence of 'religion', identified as the content necessary and sufficient for any religious belief. The explanation destabilizes it because the distinctive content emerges from sources which no epistemically rational 16 PJ.E.

This does not mean that religious belief cannot be justified; it is merely that in acknowledging that the content essential to religious belief has this source, one is provided with a reason to suspend the belief unless and until justification is provided. The 'only result' of the 'accurate survey' of the origin of religion is 'suspence ofjudgement'. Such a reason is provided only if one thinks that Hume's account is the best explanation available. In what follows, I argue that Hume's account is, despite objections from commentators, better than its contemporary alter- natives. First, some general points are in order. When Hume wrote, there were three rival accounts of the origin of religious content: the deist thesis that pre-religious thinkers reflected on the structure of the world and arrived at the notion of a single organizing intelligence,'7 the orthodox or funda- mentalist view that God revealed himself through miracles or religious experience, and the Calvinist claim that there was (and is) some natural instinct or sense of deity. Leaving aside deism for now, the orthodox and Calvinist accounts share a feature that complicates any direct comparison with Hume's. Hume's account is strictly neutral about the truth of the belief it explains, whereas the fundamentalist and Calvinist accounts are not neutral: their explanations presuppose God's existence. God either reveals himself in experience or has implanted in us some sensus divinitatis. As explanations of the core content, these are perfectly in order as long as the existence of God is not in dispute. But NHR's neutral approach deprives its opponents of explanatory resources which a religious believer might employ in a com- peting account of the origin of the idea of God. Hume's account assumes that we do not invoke God in the explanans, whereas the others do appeal to God. We cannot therefore decide that Hume's account is the better one without deciding on whether or not the belief is true. This objection only serves to remind one that NHR, and any other aspect of Hume's philosophy of religion, is part of an overall campaign and not a self-standing piece. This means that those who offer, in good intellectual conscience, competing non-neutral explanations of the idea need also to contend with Hume's attacks on our entitlement to believe in the explanans - God - launched elsewhere. This leaves the following options: (i) rebut the arguments casting doubt on the belief, thus restoring the option of non- neutral explanation; (ii) argue that the presence of the core content is inexplicable unless God is assumed; (iii) offer modified versions of the ortho- dox or Calvinist accounts which do not require God's existence in order to compete directly with Hume's. Option (i) lies beyond the scope of this paper. Option (ii) is no real option, since NHR shows that the belief is not 17 Representative texts include Herbert of Cherbury, The Antient Religion of the Gentiles (1705); John Toland, Letters to Serena (1704); Matthew Tindal, Christianity as Old as the Creation (1730). © 2007 The Author Journal compilation © 2007 The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly</page><page sequence="14">UNDERSTANDING HUME'S NATURAL HISTORY OF RELIGION 203 inexplicable. This leaves (iii). I shall show below that Hume's account is superior to neutral versions of the orthodox and Calvinist positions, and is therefore the preferable neutral account. There is a related point that needs to be addressed. The fideist of the species targeted by NHR contends that we can believe without the need for positive evidence; is he not therefore entitled to offer a competing non-neutral explanation? Can he not assume, in line with his fideism, that God exists, and then offer an explanation of the idea of God by saying that God has revealed himself or implanted an instinctive 'sense of deity' in us? If this were possible, it would seem that the fideist can appeal to God to explain the presence of the core content, and so avoid Hume's destabilizing account. This move will not work, however. NHR changes the dialectical situation, crucially blocking this response. The fideist holds that we are entitled to be- lieve without evidence, but NHR offers a destabilizing explanation of this belief. The fideist cannot simply ignore this explanation. He must show that the account fails on its own terms, or offer an alternative in order to defeat its destabilizing force. And he cannot simply revert to his fideism and appeal to God as an explanans. To be entitled to invoke God in the explanation, one must be entitled to hold that God exists. The fideist's entitlement holds only if he has independent grounds to think that Hume's destabilizing account is not the correct one. He must show that it is a failure, and that the belief is naturalistically inexplicable, or else offer an argument for the existence of God so as to be entitled to use it in the explanans, thus abandoning fideism, or else offer a competing neutral account of the presence of the content. He cannot assume that fideism is permissible in order to reject a threat to it. There is a final and general objection I should mention here. Deism, Cal- vinism and the orthodox accounts hold that polytheistic belief is a corrupted form of an original pure monotheism. Hume's account holds, on the con- trary, that monotheism emerges from polytheism. Webb, Falkenstein and Yandell think Hume fails to establish the priority claim, and that this is one reason why Hume cannot establish his account's superiority over the com- petition. But these objectors falsely take Hume as attempting to establish the priority claim as a matter of empirical or historical fact. Instead, the priority claim is supported by the explanatory power of the account, and so Hume's failure to establish it empirically is irrelevant. What misleads is a combina- tion of his remarks that polytheism is widespread among the 'barbarous nations' of the eighteenth century with the following (I, p. 34): It is a matter of fact incontestable, that about 1700 years ago all mankind were polytheists. The doubtful and sceptical principles of a few philosophers, or the theism, and that too not entirely pure, of one or two nations, form no objection worth regarding. Behold then the clear testimony of history. The farther we mount up into C 2007 The Author Journal compilation C 2007 The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly</page><page sequence="15">204 PJ.E. KAIL antiquity, the more do we find mankind plunged into polytheism.... The most ancient records of [the] human race still present us with that system as the popular and established creed.... What can be opposed to so full an evidence? This sounds as if Hume is trying to establish the priority of polytheism by appeal to historical record. But if this were Hume's entire argument, it is pretty thin. The admission of the 'not too pure theism' of one or two nations fills what is obviously a major lacuna in the place of any historically based claim; and that the 'barbarous nations' of 1757 are polytheistic cuts little ice. But we should not agree with Yandell (p. 85) that Hume 'too readily assumes that the data of polytheism suffice to prove that the theistic pro- pensity is unoriginal'. The passage above shows that Hume is not trying to establish the priority empirically. First, the passage's implied date, 'about 1700oo years ago', is the birth of Christianity. Hume knows as well as anyone that Christianity emerged from Judaism, and so taking the phrase 'all mankind were polytheists' as a strict quantificational phrase makes him monumentally stupid (or worse); the historical record tells of the existence of Judaism prior to that date. In any case, the passage explicitly allows the existence of 'one or two forms of theism'; presumably Judaism was one. Since Christianity emerged from Judaism, the date of the passage cannot refer to when religious belief first emerged. Secondly, his philosophical opponents' cases for the priority of monotheism do not appeal to historical record. They think the origin of religion extends beyond the reach of historical record (e.g., Malherbe). For the deist, the priority rests with the alleged reasonableness of monotheism; for Calvin, with a view of uncorrupted human nature. Appeals to what happened 1700 years ago are irrelevant to the priority claim. Indeed, Calvin, deists and the orthodox can happily agree with the truth of the first sentence of the passage, charitably understood. For them, religious belief was origin- ally monotheistic, but 'around 1700 years ago' mankind, apart from the Jews, were in a state of corruption. In fact, absolutely nothing in the para- graph contradicts anything in any of the competing accounts; no wonder Hume thinks it is all 'incontestable'. Since the passage does not contradict anything his opponents think, the priority claim cannot be supposed to be established historically. Instead it turns on the explanatory power of the account in general, which in turn supports the view that 'polytheism ... necessarily must have been, the first and most ancient religion of mankind' (NHR I, p. 34). Given that we have no records concerning the origin of religions, the 'history' of NHR is what Dugald Stewart, in direct response to NHR, called a conjectural or theoretical history: 'when we cannot trace the process by which an event has been pro- duced, it is often of importance to be able to show how it may have been C 2007 The Author Journal compilation © 2007 The Editors of The Philosophical QuOarterly</page><page sequence="16">UNDERSTANDING HUME'S NATURAL HISTORY OF RELIGION 205 produced by natural causes'.8" What is at stake is not whether there is some independent ground for Hume's priority claim, but whether NHR's account is better than the competition. But is it? 111.2. Deism According to deist accounts, belief in invisible intelligent power - the core content - emerges in theistic belief, prompted by the grasp of some 'obvious and invincible argument', such as the argument from design. Hume offers a two-pronged attack rendering this implausible. First, he appeals to the kinds of cognitive interests that early humans are likely to have, given their circumstances and environment. They will be interested in their immediate survival and well-being, rather than in speculations concerning the origins of order. There is no Miltonian paradise in which Adam had 'the leisure to admire the regular face of nature' but a world in which humanity is a 'bar- barous, necessitous animal ... pressed by ... numerous wants and passions' (NHR I, p. 35). The presently unpredictable interests them far more than the reliable and dull. This seems eminently sensible: if religious belief emerged in early humans, it seems likely that their cognitive interests were more practical than speculative. But the deist might now press the 'obviousness' of design (supposing it to be so): regularity cries out for explanation, and design is the obvious one. Even in a demanding environment, the obviousness of design impresses itself on early thinkers. Hume anticipates this objection, and plays the obviousness card against the deist: given that deists concede the exist- ence of polytheism, but see it as the corruption of original theism, we need now to know how this could happen in the face of the 'obviousness' of the argument for monotheism. The obvious force of an argument supposed to operate even upon the barbarous and necessitous would be such that we 'could never possibly leave that belief, in order to embrace polytheism' (NHR I, p. 36). The deist is offered a dilemma of which Hume's account does not fall foul: if the argument is so obvious, the existence of polytheism is difficult to explain; but if it is less than obvious, it is hard to see how the belief could acquire any purchase on thinkers in a hostile environment. 111.3. The fundamentalist account I turn to what Falkenstein (p. 4) calls the 'fundamentalist alternative' to Hume's account, whereby religion originated in 'direct sensory experience of the words of God and of the miracles that he performed to demonstrate his presence'. NHR does not directly address this view, and Falkenstein asks 18 Quoted in Malherbe, p. 268, to whom I owe this observation. C 2007 The Author Journal compilation C 2007 The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly</page><page sequence="17">206 P.J.E. KAIL why not (cf. Yandell, pp. 121ff.). As noted, the orthodox account is standardly a non-neutral account, but Falkenstein suggests recasting it by treating experiences as of divine presence, or as of miracles, as natural psychological phenomena. We should admit that people do have such experiences, whether veridical or not, and use these to construct a neutral account of religion's origins alternative to Hume's. And according to Falk- enstein (pp. io-ii), NHR cannot do better than this neutral version of funda- mentalism, for in order to compete, it must 'explain away claims to have received revelations or witnessed miracles by appeal to special operation of the imagination'. Since no such attempt is made, Falkenstein concludes (p. 4) that Hume did not consider NHR as 'an alternative to the fundament- alist account of the historical origins of genuine theism'. Therefore we need not accept Hume's as the best account, and so may avoid its destabilizing threat. What is more, if this modified fundamentalist account turns out to be the best account of the origin of religious concepts, it could lend support to a further argument in favour of the truth of religious belief. Though the presence of such experiences, as of the divine and as of miracles, is consistent with the non-existence of God, one might argue that they require explanation, and failing a naturalistic one, the best explanation of the experiences might be their being caused by God (cf. Yandell, pp. 123ff). But NHR need make no attempt to 'explain away claims to have received revelations or witnessed miracles by appeal to special operation of the imagination' in order to be the better explanation. The explanandum is the ac- quisition of the core content in the minds of thinkers who lack religious notions. For the neutral version of fundamentalism to compete on this score, it must hold that people had certain experiences as of the divine or as of the miraculous, in virtue of which they acquired the notion of invisible intelligent power. That some people are and were apt to describe otherwise inexplicable experiences as revelatory, or inexplicable events as miraculous, cuts little ice: their aptness to do so most probably rests on an antecedent grasp of the concept of God, and on interpreting the experiences in the light of it. Even overnight converts, who switch from non-belief to belief in the light of such experiences, already have the concept in terms of which the experience is interpreted. The phenomena constitute of course something that interests a naturalistic account of religious belief. But the widespread application of religious concepts to otherwise inexplicable experiences and events does not yet tell us anything about the emergence of those concepts. As NHR con- cerns only the emergence of the concepts, it is simply not its business to explain or explain away all the uses of them. What matters is whether fundamentalism provides a better explanation of the acquisition of the concepts than Hume's. C 2007 The Author Journal compilation © 2007 The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly</page><page sequence="18">UNDERSTANDING HUME'S NATURAL HISTORY OF RELIGION 207 But on this score Hume's account is considerably better. First, it appeals to quite general and familiar features of human psychology. These are readily intelligible to those who lack any religious concepts, and the emergence from them of the core content is straightforward. Fundamental- ism, in its appeal to distinctive experience or events, lacks this kind of generality. If it is said that the original experience was as of a voice announ- cing itself as invisible intelligent power, this 'explanation' loses any claim to identifying a psychological feature either common to most humans or intelligible independently of the concept involved. Is there then a special feeling? If so, what is it about such experiences that determines that we acquire the notion of invisible intelligent power? It seems impossible to answer without triviality ('the kind of experience that produces the con- cept ...'). Of course some concepts do require certain experiences in order for the subject to acquire them, notably phenomenal concepts such as green, red, etc. My point here is not that all concepts must be explained in a way intelligible to those who lack certain experiences. It is rather that Hume's account adequately explains the acquisition of religious concepts without the need for any special experiences. It scores highly on grounds of parsimony. NHR also explains how early thinkers start to and continue to believe when the notion is suggested to them: the priest's talk appeals to the fear and anthropomorphizing dispositions common to thinkers. But is the funda- mentalist to suppose that all in the tribe have the 'special experiences'? If only a few have them, why should others find the notion of invisible intel- ligent power at all appealing? Again Hume's account specifies features that are common and persistent features of human psychology, whereas 'special experiences' are rare, and difficult to grasp independently of the concept they are supposed to explain. Similar considerations apply, mutatis mutandis, to miracle experiences. The account is supposed to be neutral, so one cannot say that there were genuine miracles. Instead, we need to identify experiences as of a miracle in a way specifiable in terms independent of the concept of God, so that the descrip- tion can explain the acquisition of this concept. Perhaps they are experi- ences apt to produce the belief that a law of nature has been violated. As a psychological kind, this category of experience is hardly common (to put it mildly). Even if there were experiences as of violations of laws of nature (rain falling upwards, perhaps), recognizing them as such seems to require credit- ing early humans with the concept of a law of nature and its violation. Hume's account requires no such conceptual sophistication. Suppose now that we allow such experiences, and that they are recognized as such: still, why should the power that apparently violates the law automatically be © 2007 The Author Journal compilation C 2007 The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly</page><page sequence="19">208 P.J.E. KAIL thought to be intelligent? The fundamentalist has no explanation. Answers to these objections will become increasingly ad hoc. None of this casts doubt on the sincerity of claims to revelation or miracles; and nothing in NHR alone offers an argument against their veracity. It is simply that in the context of a neutral explanation of the acquisition of the core content, the neutral version of the fundamentalist alternative is quite clearly a less plausible explanation, lacking the theoret- ical virtues of Hume's. III.4. Calvinism naturalized? Calvin explains the our possession of religious concepts through 'instinct'. According to the Institutes, we have an instinctive sense of deity ultimately explained by God.19 This 'sense of Deity' (i.3.i) is a persistent and very widespread feature of human beings, a 'natural instinct' (1.3.1) 'fixed as it were in our very bones' (1.3.3). Experience 'testifies that a seed of religion is divinely sown in all' (I.4.I). This is the third alternative to NHR's explanation of the origin of religion. As it stands, the account is explanatory and non-neutral, but it is hostage to Hume's other attacks on entitlement to the key feature of the explanation, namely, God (cf. §III.i above). Its explanatory powers are moot unless and until those objections are met. Our concerns lie with a neutral, naturalized version of it, namely, that as a matter of human nature there is an instinctive sense of deity. Is Hume's account better than this? NHR denies any 'original instinct' (pace Calvin and Plantinga), and this denial is given a modal interpretation, that religious belief is not 'absolutely universal' (NHR Intro., p. 33). But it might seem to amount to nothing more than blunt denial, leaving a standoff between two conceptions of what is 'natural' to humans (cf. Yandell, pp. 84ff.). Hume claims there are nations without religious sentiments, whereas Calvin claims there is no single house- hold without religion. Both agree that there are reports of people without religious sentiments, and that religious belief is extremely pliable and expresses itself in polytheism as well as monotheism. But the data under- determine the choice of theory. For Calvin, all this means is that the natural instinct to believe in a (monotheistic) God can be, and has been, corrupted or even masked. Hume's assertion (ibid.) of the variability of religious belief and of travellers' reports of nations without religious sentiments does not, without further consideration, confirm that there are humans without religi- ous instinct. If the data underdetermine the choice of theory, there is no reason to prefer Hume's account to one postulating an innate instinct. 19 Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion, bk I, ch. 3, §I. © 2007 The Author Journal compilation © 2007 The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly</page><page sequence="20">UNDERSTANDING HUME'S NATURAL HISTORY OF RELIGION 209 However, although both accounts seem empirically equivalent, the one positing an 'instinct' has a virtus dormitiva quality which Hume's account does not have. The non-neutral account, Calvin's real one, does explain the origin of the content, since the ultimate explanandum, God, is independent of the instinct. But in its neutral version, an instinct is simply asserted. Hume's account genuinely explains why the concept of God is in circulation, whereas the other account posits an unreduced instinct and seeks to explain away apparent counter-examples. The difference between Hume and a modified Calvin is not simply a standoff between two different explanations of the same historical and sociological data (pace Yandell). One is a genuine explan- ation, the other is not. IV. APPENDIX: COMMON CONSENT So far I have considered NHR as a response to rational fideism. But it has an additional target (NHR XV, p. 86): The universal propensity to believe in invisible, intelligent power, if not an original instinct, being at least a general attendant of human nature, may be considered as a kind of mark or stamp, which the divine workman has set upon his work; and nothing surely can more dignify mankind, than to be thus selected from all other parts of the creation, and to bear the image or impression of the universal Creator. This seems to be a version of what is called in Dialogues IV the 'celebrated' argument from 'universal' or 'common' assent (henceforth ACC). The Dia- logues does not attempt to refute (ACC), and it appears that NHR seems to endorse, albeit tentatively, a version of it. Commentators therefore hold that although Hume might not ultimately endorse (ACC), there is nothing in NHR that does or could constitute an attack on it.2o I shall show, however, that quite the reverse is true. By way of preliminaries: Falkenstein (p. 12) argues that NHR cannot be an attack on (ACC), on the ground that the work states that genuine theism has a foundation in reason: 'if genuine theism is independently established ... denying that there has been a general consent to its principles constitutes nothing more than a geographical and historical remark on the extent of its popularity, not an objection to its validity'. This is a mistake. First, if genuine theism is understood as the proposition that a single invisible intelligent power exists, there can be both good and bad arguments in favour of it. So one can consistently hold that although 20 See Falkenstein; Webb, p. 149. Webb does not address (ACC) directly, but nevertheless asserts that Hume's account cannot undermine our confidence in the belief. © 2007 The Author Journal compilation C 2007 The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly</page><page sequence="21">210 PJ.E. KAIL there are good arguments for that proposition, (ACC) is not one of them. The fact, therefore, that NHR says that those other reasons are solid is quite irrelevant. Secondly, if genuine theism is instead understood as a combination of that proposition with the reasons for it other than (ACC), then quite trivially NHR is not an objection to whether common consent can support 'genuine theism'; this is because genuine theism is defined in such a way that common consent could never support it. Falkenstein also misconceives the drift of Hume's argument. He implies that Hume's rebuttal of (ACC) merely consists in the observation that there are some people without religious belief, and that this belief varies through historical and social contingency. If so, Hume's argument is not very telling. All (ACC) needs to claim is that the quite widespread belief in some kind of invisible intelligent power is evidence for its truth. As previously noted, Hume's opponents happily concede that religious belief varies across history and cultures; so anyone trying to run such an argument is unlikely to be impressed by the claim. In any case Hume's own formulation of the argu- ment allows for this variation: it states that the propensity to believe is universal to mankind - consequent, presumably, on the universality of fear and the disposition to anthropomorphize - and that this propensity, rather than its manifestation in any particular form of belief, can be considered the 'mark' or 'stamp' of the deity. As long as there is a universal propensity to believe in invisible intelligent power, (ACC) can be run. Variation in the disposition's manifestation in different historical or social contexts cannot be Hume's argument against (ACC). Nor can this consist merely in the fact that the propensity to believe is naturalistically explicable. A sufficiently clear-eyed theist might argue that although the propensity is itself naturalistically explicable, this simply pushes us back a level: he could then say that the best explanation of why our nature is so constituted is that God created us with a propensity to believe in the divine. Nothing in Hume's statement of (ACC) is at odds with this move: he allows that the propensity is not 'original', i.e., underived, and yet says that it may be considered as a 'mark' or 'stamp'. So what is Hume's response? It rests on the actual nature of the propensity. This propensity is a form of motivated irrationality, the formation of belief in spite of the lack of evidence, or even in the teeth of counter-evidence. No rational thinker can endorse a belief from that source. The propensity to assent, the premise of (ACC), is undercut by a recognition that its source is something we would recognize as providing a reason to suspend beliefs sourced in it. This is why, after the claim that the propensity 'may be considered' a mark or image of God, (NHR XV, p. 86), Hume continues: C 2007 The Author Journal compilation © 2007 The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly</page><page sequence="22">UNDERSTANDING HUME'S NATURAL HISTORY OF RELIGION 211 Examine the religious principles, which have, in fact, prevailed in the world. You will scarcely be persuaded that they are any thing but sick men's dreams: Or perhaps will regard them more as the playsome whimsies of monkies in human shape, than the serious, positive, dogmatical asseverations of a being, who dignifies himself with the name of rational. We could consider the propensity a mark of the divine, if it were not for the fact that the mark is the mark of irrationality and fear. The proponent of (ACC) must now, in full knowledge that rational agents should mistrust such sources, argue that the presence of such sources is best explained by God's giving us this nature. God made us believe by making us irrational: this would have us 'bear the image of the creator' by being epistemically irrational. We must either reject (ACC) or view God as leaving his stamp by making us irrational - not, I think, a welcome consequence. V. CONCLUSION If this is right, the kind of approach NHR offers is philosophically important: the best explanation of religious concepts makes rational fideism a position difficult to maintain. Plantinga, aware of this kind of threat, complains ('Reformed Epistemology', p. 387) that Marx and Freud simply assert that religious concepts are explained by wishful thinking. Whether this is right about Freud or Marx, Hume's actually offers a genuinely explanatory account of the origin of religion which does away with a Calvinist instinct. When put together with his attack on revealed religion - 'Of Miracles' - and on rational religion - the arguments of the Dialogues and elsewhere - The Natural History of Religion completes Hume's case against the rational accept- ability of religion.21 Oxford University 21 Thanks to audiences at the Universities of Central Michigan, Oxford and Bristol, and at the APA Central Division at Chicago, 2005.
