<plain_text><page sequence="1">Foundations of the world republic. By G. A. BORGESE. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1953. Pp. 320. $6.50. This volume is the persuasive historical and moral apologia for the noble Preliminary Draft of a World Constitution (published in the appendix), prepared by the distinguished com- mittee of academicians of the University of Chicago of which the late G. A. Borgese was the secretary-general, as well as director of Common cause, its prophetic journal. This is a tough and a beautiful book to read. It is prose poetry, dialectic, philosophy, and religion. The author calls in Plato, St. Paul, Dante, Goethe, and Kant as great pred- ecessors and really as contemporaries to sup- port his thesis. It would take one of these to do justice to this profound book. The histori- cal analyses are fresh and arresting. The au- thor defines his terms, such as "community," "myth," and "the natural law," in convincing terms. Throughout, there are original and sug- gestive interpretations of the Old Testament and of the Christian Gospel. The volume is full of, quotable material, every bit of which would provoke long and fruitful Socratic dis- cussion. It must be added that in places the writing is a bit labored and strained. It is regrettable</page><page sequence="2">434 REVIEWS OF BOOKS that the high and pressing purposes of this volume are not also served in simple, lucid, and compelling terms for the nonintellectual but intelligent and earnest citizen whose name is legion. Only the very erudite will follow the writing and logic easily and appreciate all of the rich allusions. In his brilliant and epigrammatic opening chapter the author declares that "the era of humanity has not begun but the age of nations has ended" (p. 3). In answer to the objection that world government is impossible because there exists no world community, he writes: "History, correctly questioned, does not an- swer that a government, a state, arises when the respective community is fullfledged. It answers that a government, a state, meets halfway the needs of a fledgling community, arises at the critical stage when a community in the making demands a pattern, a mold of law, for its further maturation to take shape" (p. 25). The author treats of "The meaning of war," pacifism, and the various proposals for a world republic fairly and cogently. He looks searchingly at the Soviet Union, at the United States, and at the cold war, in both power and moral terms. His own final description of jus- tice, elaborately treated, as the prerequisite of peace, is: "The mediator between justice as unconditioned righteousness and justice as functional adjustment . . . cannot be called by a less sentimental name than charity. It is more than brotherhood, more than mercy. Charity is Eros, which is Love" (p. 149). Later, more plainly, he writes: "Justice, then, as she captained in Plato the other virtues, temperance, wisdom, courage, so is she now guided by, ultimately identified with, caritas in the meaning of reverence to life, submis- sion to and co-operation with the destination of the universe enfolded in the process which anthropomorphic idioms call the will of God. * . . Act then in such a way that thy action and its norm should become 'a universal law,' intended for the growth in freedom and crea- tive advancement of the universality of man" (p. 220). Later he writes of "justice first, then peace as the fruition of justice, and reinter- preted justice as the adjustment of society, stretch for stretch of evolution's road, to the however unseen destination of man" (p. 292). One has left unmentioned so much in this rich volume. In the unusual treatment of the welfare state the author concludes that "one must nevertheless believe with all true poetry and science that man is, as far as we know, -the vanguard of the divine in. the universe; he must be trusted . . ." (p. 249). On this note of mature, informed, and inspired faith we close this noble and enduring book. HUNTLEY DUPRE Macalester College</page></plain_text>
