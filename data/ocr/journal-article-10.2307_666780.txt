<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ecological Factors in the Origin of Incest MARIAM KREISELMAN SLATER Queens College INTRODUCTION T HE universality of the incest taboo and/or exogamy is almost as puzzling t a phenomenon today as it was at the dawn of anthropology. Although the latest attempts to account for it are satisfactory in some respects, they seem to be at variance with widely accepted developments in general anthropological theory, chiefly with interaction theory (Chapple and Arensberg 1940; Homans 1950; Homans and Schneider 1955; Polanyi, Arensberg and Pearson 1957). In an attempt to align current theory and hypothesis, I suggest here a new approach to the origin of exogamy. The procedure used could be considered an exercise in the derivation of an hypothesis from theory, or simply the explora- tion of some implications of interaction principles in a purely speculative area where they have not yet been applied. Juxtaposed with this methodology is another line of research-human ecology. The level of analysis within this dual orientation is neither psycho- logical nor culturological but, in the broadest American sense, anthropological. That is, I do not hold human biology constant, but consider it a variable affected by changing techno-environmental contexts. Not only the search but even the need for new questions about exogamy seems to be obscured by a number of philosophical presuppositions in the work of current authors, some even contrary to the principles of evolution. Perhaps certain assumptions have gone unnoticed because recent theories account ade- quately for certain stages of the problem, but not, I believe, the initial ones. My point of departure, therefore, must be a summary and critique of current opinion, for which I have selected the following representative anthropologists: Leslie White (1949); Brenda Z. Seligman (1950); and Claude Levi-Strauss (1949, 1956). THE PROBLEM First it is necessary to make a brief statement about the cross-cultural data, the general problem, and the clarification of terms. To be concise, let us say that all societies have patterned some form of marriage, and in doing so, usually forbid an individual to mate with his parents, siblings, or children. These pro- scriptions may extend beyond the nuclear group. The following statement qualifies the above generalizations: No society ever permits an individual to mate with all members of his or her family of orientation or procreation. The problem, of course, is to explain why this model is universal. The man- ner in which societies regulate restrictions on sexual intercourse and the forma- tion of marriage ties has been described variously as "incest prohibition," "exogamy," and "incest taboo." 1042</page><page sequence="2">[SLATER] The Origin of Incest 1043 In the semantic juggling of these sometimes overlapping concepts, most students recognize three basic distinctions. First, there are differences between rules qua rules and those accompanied by behavior connoted by the word taboo. Secondly, some of the rules or attitudes pertain exclusively to the nuclear family, and some extend beyond. And finally, there are distinctions between norms governing sexual relations and those regulating marriage. In the ensuing discussion we trust that the context will make concepts reasonably clear. CURRENT THEORIES Seligman, White, and Levi-Strauss all discuss whether temporal and func- tional priority should be granted to exogamy or to incest prohibitions. Seligman takes the latter position: "All marriage prohibitions [exogamy] are generaliza- tions of the two incest prohibitions [against parent-child and sibling sex rela- tions], exogamy being a simple generalization of incest to the unilateral descent group" (1950: 307). She cites societies that have never possessed rules of group exogamy but do possess sexual taboos within the nuclear family. Some forms of these taboos are universal, she points out, whereas group marriage rules only appear after long development and only in some societies. The function of the incest prohibitions, Seligman continues, is to consoli- date and maintain the cohesiveness of the nuclear group, for society rests upon the cohesiveness of separate families. Such a theory is similar to that of Mali- nowski, who points out that sexual desire within the family would destroy the only social order a primitive society knows by replacing previously existing sentiments with sexual emotions, a process which he considers to be disruptive (1927: 243ff.). White, on the other hand, believes that the incest taboo is derived from exogamy, whose function is a socioeconomic one. He names as his intellectual ancestor Tylor, whose "marry-out-or-die-out" formula was intended to explain how the compactness of a tribe is maintained despite the spreading of clans: "Again and again in the world's history, savage tribes must have had plainly before their minds the simple practical alternative between marrying-out and being killed out . . . ," for life demanded the cooperation of ever larger groups (Tylor 1888:267). Although, as Seligman points out, the incest taboo antedates clan organiza- tion, White thinks that the "definition and prohibition of incest" can also be explained by Tylor's insight concerning exogamy or group rules. He reasons thus: mutual aid is necessary for cultural life, and incest would short-circuit the cooperation that symbolling (culture) makes not only possible but neces- sary: "Other factors being constant, the tribe that exploits most fully the pos- sibilities of mutual aid will have the best chance to survive" (1949:315). With the emergence of culture, White maintains, a "new cooperative or- ganization for food and defense was built upon a structure already present: the family. After all, virtually everyone belonged to one family or another" (1949:315). He continues: "Cooperation between families cannot be estab- lished if parent marries child; and brother, sister. A way must be found to over-</page><page sequence="3">1044 American Anthropologist [61, 1959 come this centripetal tendency with a centrifugal force. This way was found in the definition and prohibition of incest . . ." (1949:316). And finally: "Incest was defined and exogamous rules were formulated in order to make cooperation compulsory and extensive, to the end that life be made more secure" (1949: 329). As evidence for this theory, White adduces the economic nature of marriage throughout the world. According to him, the whole question has confused an- thropologists because of their "anthropomorphic predilection for psychology," despite the fact, he says, that psychology shows the wish to commit incest, not the motive for preventing it. Psychology tells us "the way the human primate organism behaves . . . within, or with reference to one of ... [the extant] cultural forms . . ." (1949:312), but only culturology, he maintains, can ac- count for the origin of the prohibitions. Seligman, on the other hand, shows that "By itself, exogamy might have no survival value," for it has led to capture or feuds, even to the extinction of the group, as Bridges discovered in Tierra del Fuego (Seligman 1950: 308). Like Seligman, Levi-Strauss seeks to account for the existence of discrete families, which he assumes to be the necessary condition for the fabric of so- ciety. A family, he says, is defined only as a group which cannot marry into itself. (We shall retain this definition of the family throughout.) Offspring must therefore seek mates elsewhere. Add to this his alleged facts that the male is naturally polygynous and dominant and the female a scarce commodity (1949:30), and we see why the exchange of mates between family groups links them into the wider and wider networks which are the essence of all societies. In this view, the prohibition of incest and exogamy are therefore negative and positive statements of the same idea. Let us clarify this insight with the follow- ing quotation: Exactly in the same way that the principle of sexual division of labor establishes a mutual dependency between the sexes, compelling them thereby to perpetuate them- selves and found a family, the prohibition of incest establishes a mutual dependency between families, compelling them ... to give rise to new families (1956:277). The existence of the family, says Levi-Strauss, is not caused by psycho- logical bonds, the mother instinct, the needs of procreation. "For the whole of mankind the absolute requirement for the creation of a family is the previous existence of two other families" (1956:277). He says that "unlike animals, a family could not exist if there were no society: i.e. a plurality of families ready to acknowledge that there are other links than consanguineous ones . . ." (1956: 278). And how did this process begin? ... If society had a beginning, this could only have consisted in the incest pro- hibition, since . . . the incest prohibition is in fact a kind of remodeling of the biological conditions of mating and procreation (which know no rule, as can be seen from ob- serving animal life) compelling them to become perpetuated only in an artificial frame- work of taboos and obligations. It is there, and only there, that we find a passage from nature to culture, from animal to human life . . . (Levi-Strauss 1956:278). The incest taboo exists, he concludes, both to insure the fact that families</page><page sequence="4">SLATER] The Origin of Incest 1045 will exist and to prevent their becoming self-sufficient units. " ... .Mankind has understood very early that he must marry out," for too much hate and fear lie in the isolating influence of consanguinity (1956: 278). CRITIQUE Final Cause. To use philosophical terms for the moment, all three of the theories discussed deal with final cause insofar as they equate function with ultimate motive or origin: we have rules for the sake of (whose result is) a cer- tain end, whether it be consolidation of the family, cooperation, or social soli- darity. Even granting that these ends are properly identified, that they were necessary to survival, and that no other means could have accomplished them, an essential question remains unanswered. By what process did man develop prohibitions in order to survive? That is, why did he not die out? Teleology must be reconciled with some evolutionary model. Either exogamy was an ac- cidental variation, a "mutation," that led to survival, or it was a result of socio- economic pressures of the environment-the Lysenko model. In either case, how did the emergent appear? And once it appeared, is its universality attrib- uted to convergence, parallel development, or monogenesis? These theories cannot tell us, for they suggest no social equivalent of genetic principles, which is necessary if theory and hypothesis are not to be out of joint. Tylor and White even consider exogamy to be a "simple, practical alterna- tive." But how likely is it that even one group, let alone many isolated societies, would have had a Ways and Means Committee with sociological clairvoyance and the power to enforce their decision? Whether exogamy persists as a cradle trait or whether it occurred repeatedly, no exponent of final cause can say why the human race did not die out, for an answer lies elsewhere than in the method of observing only the end products of evolution. Such phenomena as the paral- lel cleavage of marital and economic lines of exchange point up only a connec- tion between the course man took and its consequences, not why or how he took it. That living societies have behaved in a prosurvival manner is a tautol- ogy. Furthermore, we cannot harbor hypotheses whose unstated assumptions are teleological. One other functional approach must be mentioned. Talcott Parsons has made an analysis of the nuclear family as a "small group" whose primary func- tion is the socialization of the young (1954). He believes that the family could not exist as such a unit without the incest taboo and that the taboo creates the only possible emotional atmosphere for socialization. A detailed account of his discussion falls outside the limits of this paper because the functions he delineates for the incest taboo do not, according to him, explain origins. Efficient Cause. As Homans and Schneider (1955:16) demonstrate in their analysis of Levi-Strauss's patterns of marriage, long-term interests are served only if they conform to short-term interests: no society sees what is good for it and does it. But neither sociology nor psychology has shown any short-term interests that are sufficiently generalized as to account for the origin of exog- amy or the family that does not marry within itself.</page><page sequence="5">American Anthropologist [61, 1959 1046 Like Malinowski's disruptive-force-of-sex theory, Seligman's examination of individual psyches offers us only efficient causes; that is, mechanisms operat- ing within an already established system. That incestuous emotions are dis- ruptive in societies where they are not allowed is redundant. Where nuclear- family matings are allowed, insofar as they are, they are not disruptive. Cases like those of the Azande and Chuckchi demonstrate that there is no potentially disruptive sentiment preventing sexual relations between parent and child because of the nature of-their interaction per se. Such cases cannot be explained away as anomalies, for the emotions are characteristic of cultures, not of individuals deviating from cultural norms. And the idea of "insane" cultures is untenable insofar as the concept of culture implies an orderly and regular learning process. However, even if these fortuitous examples were not empirically known, what we know of the nature of culture would indicate that such occurrences were possible, and each would have its appropriate psychological mechanism. We must use other evidence than end-products or accidental remains of the ethnographic record, other laws that would connect existence with necessity. The problem of incest involves more than empirical generalizations. If only brown people had survived to be observed, we would not be justified in assum- ing that some law made it the only possible skin color compatible with survival. Efficient-cause analysis can predict probable sentiments and the institu- tions with which they might correlate, once a specific organization of social relations is given. But no psychological law can determine nor any efficient cause explain the initial organization. Furthermore, it is clear from the cultural variability of several phenomena associated with exogamy that no general psychological law explains it; that is, one man's taboo "sibling" is the same man's wife elsewhere. Formal Cause. Levi-Strauss formulates final-cause explanations that are not very illuminating: the incest taboo is "instituted only to found and guar- antee ... an exchange" (1949:65). But in addition he makes brilliant use, as we have indicated, of formal cause-the pattern or model or blueprint with reference to which a system operates. Through such an analysis he has identi- fied the dynamic behind the proliferation of all possible marriage systems; namely, the emergence of groups that do not marry within themselves. The family by this definition is the original organizational set mentioned above, or what Homans calls the "external system." To know what determined the external system is to know what influenced all primordial men to marry out. If we had such knowledge, we would then understand not why men require more than the isolated family "in order to" survive, as people have assumed, but rather, we would know why the family and the larger society happen by nature to be co-eval. To understand the emergence of the family is the prior methodological task. This realization has been latent in each of the incest theories examined, and only the principles of interaction theory make it explicit. To have shown the lacunae in present ideas, we hope, will stimulate search in new directions, even if the path we propose should prove in turn to be blind.</page><page sequence="6">SLATER] The Origin of Incest 1047 As we have seen, Levi-Strauss says that he cannot account for the emer- gence of the family, but that somehow it marks that point where nature and culture meet. White begs the question of the emergence of the family by as- suming part of what he sets out to prove. According to him, the family (which means an exogamous group) appeared before the emergence of culture. Yet he claims that only the exigencies of cultural life produced exogamy. Thus, it seems to me that the emergence of the family cannot be explained by exogamy, since he conceives them as one. His view implies that the family became a dis- crete unit in need of mutual aid without ceasing to breed within itself, since he says the prohibition could not arise without culture. (Freud creates a similar paradox by stating that the prohibition of incest was the first cultural phenom- enon, yet it was prompted by remorse, which he fails to identify as also a cul- tural phenomenon.) Seligman faces the question with an inadequate efficient-cause explanation. White evidently excludes the problem of the emergence of a group that has not married into itself because he thinks it would commit him to dealing with the psychological: "Rules of exogamy originated as crystallizations of processes of a social system rather than as products of individual psyches" (1949:318). We are in agreement with this last statement, but there are more social pro- cesses than are dreamed of in his culturology. How can we both face the prob- lem and continue to avoid the reductionism that White has so successfully circumvented? The apparent impasse results, we believe, from the assumption, shared by all three theorists, that the prohibition of incest is the only means of preventing it, the only guarantee of maintaining discrete families. The road to the impasse is paved with the following suppositions. First, equal weight is given to all variations of the ethnographic record without considering ecology. And sec- ondly, it is assumed that what something is and what it began as are closely related if not the same. Today we see taboos and prohibitions that accompany mating out, and the theorists assume that no primates would have mated out without cultural prohibitions. But I think that any animal would do so under certain conditions. After all, a certain species of wasp must mate out because its mother dies before it is hatched. I suggest instead the possibility that both incest prohibitions and exoga- mous rules are late in social evolution. I suggest that intranuclear matings were nonexistent long before any prohibitions against them ever occurred. Interaction theory demands such an assumption. According to the precepts of interaction theory, taboos and prohibitions, being symbol systems, indicate an external system that gave them impetus. What else could lead to them except what we shall call nuclear exogamy? This term is not introduced as mere verbal dialectic, but as a reminder that we are not dealing with cultural rules or taboos but with the mere absence of a certain kind of mating. An absence of nuclear mating (except for the parent couple) implies that other interactions were occurring. We do not know empirically that all socie- ties had or even have (see p. 1058) prohibitions against incest. We know only</page><page sequence="7">A merican Anthropologist [61, 1959 1048 that no group has elaborated rules which include unrestricted mating of that sort. The key is not in the prohibition but in the absence of positive sanctions. Only late in the developmental cycle of culture patterns do values (such as prohibitions) come into being. Some sentiments solidify into taboos and re- main for reasons that efficient-cause analysis might explain. But they are pre- ceded by the interactions they represent. As Arensberg puts it: . . . Social arrangements make their own values in the process of becoming culture patterns .... The evolution of a culture pattern is just such an emergence of ... symbolizing values, meaning . . . and concept about a ... pattern of action, making it ready for recognition, sanction, and transmission. Action comes first, in anthro- pology's view of culture, whether it be the wheel, or divine monarchy, or parallel cousin marriage, and values come second.... In this anthropology repeats the dis- coveries of small group and industrial studies, where new group norms . . . likewise arise out of changes in interpersonal and group action (Arensberg 1957: 104-05). I will discuss what early ecological conditions independent of cultural rules determined nuclear exogamy, but first I must anticipate objections and sug- gest why taboos were ever invented, if incest was for some reason impossible. The answer is that under some ecological circumstances (but, we must infer, not the earliest ones), people became capable for the first time of forming child- rearing alliances within the family. Then why, you might ask, were they not formed and crystallized into rules more frequently than in the few royal clans that did so? This is the point in the cycle where the Seligman-Malinowski hy- pothesis is explanatory: incest was not permitted because it would have been disruptive to an already existing system. Why did such a system have so conservative a nature? Why was it not re- placed? The insights of White and Levi-Strauss are relevant to this question. Kinship systems had become closely and delicately enmeshed with economic patterns, and together they formed the very fabric of society. Today the incest taboo in any non-kin-based society is a cultural lag. Furthermore, on another level, we could point out that it is not anomalous to find that what is not pre- scribed yet possible becomes proscribed-perhaps always so with sexual be- havior for reasons it is outside my focus to explore. My methodological focus is only on the determinants of the external system. That the solution to the puzzle lies in this direction is a necessary deduction within the framework of interaction theory. But can we be more concrete? SOLUTION Material Cause. One other Aristotelian category remains; namely, the ma- terial cause, the constituents from which a thing is made. If we were discussing a house, the material cause would be the bricks instead of the builder, the blue- prints, or the final object designed for the purpose of shelter. These constit- uents may be called structural in the sense of being conditions to which things not only do but must conform. To recapitulate, I have implied that early hominids did not mate out be- cause of expediency, sentiment, or an accident that gave them a chance to</page><page sequence="8">SLATER] The Origin of Incest 1049 survive. They did not mate out to form bonds of mutual aid or because of cul- tural prohibitions. On the contrary, the cooperative bonds as well as the pro- hibitions must have been consequences of their having already mated out because of structural necessity. My hypothesis is, then, that a certain kind of group even mating at random, both incestuously and otherwise, would form extra-nuclear child-rearing ties with sufficient frequency (a tenet of interaction theory) as to be the only pos- sible focus for elaboration once culture emerged. Random mating, of course, could not long persist among cultural animals, for where there is culture there is regularity. But such patterning or structuring must have a beginning and must make use of what exists. To repeat, marriage patterns must have been based on behavioral interaction that is statistically likely to have occurred among animals of a certain kind before they developed any cultural biases. To prove the hypothesis, one would have to find an animal that had to seek individuals other than parents, children, or siblings for mates. An animal would be so compelled only if his kin were not of the proper ages for mating. Then one would have to demonstrate that the earliest hominid patterns arose from such a background. If these conditions were met, all variations of the ethnographic record pertaining to rules and taboos would be as explicable as any other cul- tural elaboration. The reason why the ideal solution has not been considered self-evident is that in most contemporary cultures-as among lower animals-incestuous groups could function as long and as well as many others in terms of vital sta- tistics. However, the very simplest technologies and subsistence ecologies in- volve biological factors not immediately apparent. It is in societies which ap- proach this simplicity that one finds hints of that structural necessity which theory demands to have been the basis for the earliest form of human society. The structural necessity that determines nuclear exogamy is complex, in- volving birth, fertility, and maturation rates as well as life expectancy and birth order. Let us first consider nonhuman primates and reconstruct some hypothetical vital statistics to demonstrate in a new sense how certain animals would have to mate out or die out. (Note that Tylor did not refer to marrying out or "dying out," but to marrying out or "being killed out." He did not as- sume natural death, but death as the result of actions of other people or the effects of a hostile environment if people did not band together.) Let us imagine that the life span of a species is four years. Puberty occurs at the age of three years, after 75 percent of the life span has passed. The fe- male produces only one offspring per birth, and the gestation period is three months. The progeny must be nursed for two months, whereupon the mother becomes pregnant again and three months later bears her second child. After the second child has nursed for two months and can fend for itself, the mother becomes pregnant again, but within two months she is dead, and thus no in- dividual can give birth to more than two offspring in her lifetime. Further- more, each child has a 50 percent chance of reaching the age of reproduction. By the time the first child reached puberty, the parents would have been</page><page sequence="9">1050 A merican A nthropologist [61, 1959 dead for about two years, thus preventing any parent-child incest. Even if sexual play occurred between adult and small child, sexual intercourse could not occur in the case of the immature male. At any rate, the species could not be continued through parent-child matings. Let us now see whether the siblings, the Fi generation, could continue the species, assuming that both live and are of opposite sex, a possibility realized in only one out of every five families. If two siblings mated, the female could produce only one offspring instead of her potential two, due to the five-month age differential between siblings. Thus, to continue the species, the single grandchild would have to mate out. Furthermore, as we have seen, in 80 per- cent of families any member of the Fi generation would have to breed out or die childless. Even in families with two opposite-sexed siblings, the probability of incest is further minimized by the fact that the older child has already lived half of his or her sexually mature months before the younger reaches puberty. The chances are that this individual would already have mated out or left home before the other sibling comes of age. Similar results would occur if the life span of a species is 20 years, if the female can give birth only every fourth year, and if each sex reaches the age of reproduction at 15, considering the gestation period to be one year. No mother could have more than two children, and the second child would have to be self- sufficient at the age of one. By the time the first child reached puberty, the parents would have been dead for ten years. If the first child is female, she could conceive a child by her brother only in her next to last year of life. Again the Fa generation would have to mate out. Finally, we see that a family with two children could occur only if the parent couple are closer age mates than intrafamily mating allows, except in the case of twins. If the same age of puberty prevailed, but we raise the life expectancy to 27 and the fertility rate to one birth every five years, the following would occur: Again, parent-child matings would be impossible. But the female would be able to bear three children in her life. If the first child were female and the sec- ond male, the former could produce only two children by him. She could bear a third child only if the third sibling were male. In other words, any two chil- dren of opposite sex born in succession could produce only two children, thus causing the noncontinuance of the family as in the first case. Only rarely would the birth order permit a woman to have the three children she was capable of bearing. It would be possible to extrapolate known human life cycles and approach the assumed vital statistics of some creature intermediate between the first hominid and his nearest precursor. But instead of postulating detailed patterns of a form whose fossil remains are unknown and whose habits are perhaps un- knowable, let us examine only those hints available in the life of primitive con- temporaries. Surprisingly, the more primitive the ecology, the more closely we approach the hypothetical ideal. So close do we approach it that we call the next heading "evidence" for the hypothesis that theory demands.</page><page sequence="10">1051 SLATER] The Origin of Incest EVIDENCE Ludwik Krzywicki, in his book Primitive Society and Its Vital Statistics (1935), has made a thorough search of the literature that underscores the fol- lowing points necessary for our thesis: Relatively speaking, the life of the most primitive people is short, few children reach maturity, and the reproductive period is reduced. He quotes Spencer and Gillen on the subject of the Austra- lian woman: "By the time she is 25 or, at most 30, she is completely passee, and at 40 is a veritable hag .... There are probably few who live beyond the age of 50" (Krzywicki 1935:120). Of 25 of these women studied, 16 percent were under 12 at the birth of their first child, and 16 percent over 16, with an average age of 14. The average period of child-bearing is 15 years (Krzywicki 1935: 129), and the mother is usually barren by the age of thirty-five. No woman gives birth to more than five children, and from 40 to 50 percent of them die within a few months. As among most hunters and gatherers, one finds in Australia a long suckling period, although this is not a nutritional necessity if the environment is a lush one providing easily digestible food. I have not found any material on the rela- tion of suckling periods to exigencies of the ecology. I can only deal with exist- ing practices, assuming some relation to necessity if there is a high correlation of long suckling and unfavorable ecologies. According to Krzywicki, among the Australians each child is nursed from two to four years. If the mother dies within this period, the child too is likely to die. If a confinement occurs before three years have passed, the new child is killed or else it would die for lack of mother's milk. Such are the conditions of life in Australia whose surplus is sufficient for polygyny to be possible. Even so primitive a contemporary as the Australians have an ecology vastly more developed than at the beginning of culture. They possess stone celts; their dart thrower is probably no earlier than the Wuirm glaciation. But even allowing for the greater ease of food getting among them, their vital sta- tistics suggest corroborative evidence for our hypothesis. Under harder condi- tions, there must have been even fewer children born, and they had even shorter lives. In the stationary population of the Andamans, where food is more abun- dant, Krzywicki reports (1935:147) that each woman raises from three to four children. The Bushmen raise only two or three of their children, nursing each for three years and killing later infants. Only 50 percent of the Fuegians' aver- age of four children reach maturity. One woman had 18 children, but all died except three. In Alaska the Eskimo have only one or two living children; on Bering Strait, from two to three (Krzywicki 1935:151). In The Role of the Aged in Primitive Society, Leo Simmons (1945) produces similar samplings and figures. "Between the thirtieth and fortieth years, in the case of men, and even earlier in the case of women," he quotes from Im Thurm's report on the Arawak, ". . . the body, except the stomach, shrinks, the fat disappears and the skin hangs in hideous folds." Jenks describes the Igorot as</page><page sequence="11">1052 A merican A nthropologist [61, 1959 getting old at thirty, their muscles losing form by forty-five. Howorth in Mon- golia notes that the women are middle-aged at thirty. On the whole, Simmons concludes, only 3 percent of primitive people reach sixty-five. And long before this they have passed the age of reproduction, for old age sets in between the ages of thirty and forty-five. Although reproduction may be possible despite the appearance of old age, the time of death shortens the period of child- rearing. According to Todd, (1927:481-496), the mean age of death in West Africa was 30, and more than half the Tasmanians were dead at twenty-five. Of 600 Indians at Pecos between the years 1800 and 1838, only sixty reached the age of sixty-five. In general, he says, 15 percent of deaths of primitive people be- tween the ages of 20 and 39 are due to childbirth. He places the difference in peaks of mortality between primitives and moderns at thirty years. Not only is the child-rearing cycle shortened by the early onset of senes- cence or death among primitives, but the human animal under all conditions does not as a rule begin to reproduce until relatively late. Neither ovulation nor spermatogenesis occurs before puberty (Henshaw 1953:572), a stage marked in the female by the menarche. The onset of menstruation is the same on the average throughout the world, occurring at the age of 15; the lowest average reported is that among the Spanish-Maya at 12.81 years of age; the highest, among the Spanish from Asturia, at 16.98 (Hooton 1947:251). But puberty in women does not always coincide with the beginning of fertility, for: "... The first few years after the menses appear as a period of relative sterility" (Ford 1945: 22). In modern Europe, the menopause occurs between the ages of 45 and 50; the male usually is fertile until after 50 (Hooton 1947:266). And post-Neolithic man has a longer breeding period and is more prolific also because he possesses foods that render long suckling unnecessary. Depending on the culture and ecology, weaning takes place at any time from six months to twelve years (Ford 1945:78; Hooton 1947:259). However, modern man is weaned on the average at 18 months; primitive man on the average at 2 or 3 years (Hooton 1947). This difference lowers the birth rate among primitives because ovulation occurs only rarely during lactation. The technical reason for this is that "puri- fied lactogenic hormone will induce functional activity of corpora lutea, which secrete progesterone, which in turn inhibits pituitary release of lutinizing hor- mone" (Henshaw 1953). It takes a theoretical minimum of 280 days after the first menstrual flow following weaning to the birth of a new baby (Hooton 1953: 255). From the above data we have made two charts illustrating the degree of incompatibility between incestuous unions and child-rearing units in a society where the vital statistics conform to probable models. Among the vital sta- tistics, there are five significant variables: age at menarche; length of sterile period; duration of suckling; onset of menopause; age at death. Although men can produce more children in a given time than women, this does not alter the situation. It is pointless to draw a chart for every possible combination of</page><page sequence="12">1053 SLATER] The Origin of Incest factors. In Chart 1 we take average conditions. Chart 2 shows the ages when the variables are the lowest points of the range. In both of these cases, one sees the relative ages of one mother and her children. Since half of any woman's offspring are likely to die, each child has an equal chance of life or death. The relative ages of the siblings or half-siblings, then, depend on the time of death in relation to the order of birth. The relation of sex to order of birth is also an influence on mating patterns, and the chance of being male or female in any one case is of course equal. We are led by the scant available literature to believe that on the average each woman bears five children within fifteen years of reproductive life. The number of children reaching maturity depends on all the variables mentioned. In interpreting these charts as opposed to the imaginary life cycles out- lined previously, not only vital statistics but another factor must be taken into consideration; i.e., the sexual division of labor, which is a given in all known human societies and totally absent among all other living primates. The sexual division of labor influences breeding patterns, but we cannot reconstruct the phylogenetic appearance of the phenomenon. Regarding this factor, we cannot extrapolate from human to protohominid society. In the earliest human societies (possessing the simplest inventory of ex- ploitative techniques), we know that no significant surplus is possible, what- ever the environment-whether warm eolithic prairies and soft-wood forests, the woolly mammoth's habitat, or an interglacial environment like that of today. With no surplus, developmental laws assure us that there could have been no more than a sexual division of labor. It is also probable that this much division of labor was necessary. We are familiar with some Eskimo groups whose adults cannot survive without mates, or children without both parents. This is a special case, but Levi-Strauss says that among primitives in general: "there are no bachelors, simply for the reason that they could not survive" (1956:269). Furthermore, "The number of males and females in any random grouping is approximately the same with a normal balance of about 110 to 100 to the advantage of either sex" (1956:267). Since polygyny is unlikely with such an ecology, men and women are approximately equally paired off at any given time, even if there is a continual succession of different mates. Among the first hominids, food gathering was probably more insecure than it is among most of the simplest cultures observed by anthropologists in the ethnographic present. As Childe says, primitive contemporaries are more like Mesolithic than Paleolithic peoples; that is, their life is more settled and there is a larger surplus (Childe 1956:97). According to Sauer, certain types of vege- tation could not even have appeared until population pressure produced man's wanderings, which precipitated changes in his habitat (1947:7-20). Even after they existed, millennia later, many items could not have been incorporated into the diet before fire. Nor could people use hard seeds before grinding. Sauer points out that there were probably no specialized hunters until the Solutrean period, and these were limited to the arctic and plains regions.

The density of these primitive sedentaries, although greater than that of mod- ern gatherers, did not exceed one or several to a square mile (Sauer 1947:19). Such a human group is something like Steward's patrilineal band, and an in- crease of total population in the band is impossible (Steward 1955:126). We mention these details to show that until migration and expansion occur, the possibility of surplus is at a minimum. And if primordial groups could not have risen above the lowest ecological balance, this balance has specific sequelae. Only relatively stable pairs rather than lone individuals can rear children to maturity. The effects of such patterning are considered below in a discussion of the interactions of individuals represented in the charts. Mother-Son. Working with Chart 1, assuming the mother's menopause or death at 35, only one of her five possible children could be the father of any of his mother's children. This could occur if the first child is a male and if he lives to maturity. He would then be the father of his mother's fifth child. However, if the first child dies between weaning and puberty, the second child, if alive and male, could not produce a child with his mother, for the last child she can have would already be three years old when he reaches puberty. Only if the first child dies within the first year could the second child impregnate his mother; again, it is only one among her children who could do so. If death oc- curs before the age of 35, none of her children could father a child; if before 33, none could be a mate. We see, then, that the chances of mother-son child-rearing units are at a minimum, reduced by the probabilities of the sex and viability of the first child and by the age of death. Even under the most favorable conditions, a son could father only one child by his mother, and her death or old age would fol- low soon after. For all but the beginning of his reproductive life, the son would seek sexual partners elsewhere and be bound to outside child-rearing units of longer duration. In Chart 2, where the reproductive cycle begins earlier and the conditions enable a mother to be more prolific, the mother has already had her fifth and probably last child, if we go by averages, by the time the first child reaches puberty, setting puberty in both sexes back to the age of 13 instead of fifteen. With the maximum of viable offspring, the mother is still suckling her fifth child when her first son reaches puberty. If he remains with his mother for the first two years of his reproductive life and if she has a statistically improbable sixth child, he can be its father. If some of her children die between her first living child and her last, the son could also father the fifth child. If her death occurs at 35, she could have a seventh child, but if she dies at 30, she would not have a sixth child. Again, the second child reaches puberty close to the onset of the mother's old age or death. And for an even longer period of his life than the first son, he would have to find mates elsewhere. Father-Daughter. Again, the early death of the parent group would make the frequency of father-daughter matings low, but they would be more fre-</page><page sequence="15">A roerican A nthropologist [61, 1959 1056 quent than mother-son unions from the view of producing rather than rearing offspring because the death of the father would not interfere with suckling the infant. In Chart 1, we see that the fifth child is likely to die because the mother cannot nurse it for three years. This reduces the chances of having three gen- erations of intrafamily matings. If a boy mates with his mother, the offspring would be this fifth child whose death prevents its father from mating in turn with it. Only very rarely could a male produce offspring by his mother and her daughter. He cannot even mate with the age-mates of such a child for a very long period of time. Again, the greatest number of breeding years of a woman cannot be with her aged father. In Chart 1 a father is 16; in Chart 2, 14, when his daughter is a year old. By the time, in Chart 1, she is 17 and could conceive her first child, her father or any of his age mates would be 33, with little if any life expectancy. By the time, in Chart 2, that she is 13 and could conceive her first child, her father would be twenty-seven. He could provide for her for per- haps six years, during the suckling periods of her first two children, before death occurred. In none of these cases are we considering death at 25, which occurs with some frequency, according to our data. In such cases, there could be no parent-child incest whatever. At best, any relationship between a person of the Fi with a member of the F2 generation, when the life span is from 25 to 35, and when puberty starts from 13 to 16, is extremely short-lived. Even if a marriage rule fostered such matings where they were possible, the rest of the members of the F2 generation would have to seek mates elsewhere as would the incestuous siblings for most of their breeding life, for they cannot survive without mates, to the extent that there is a sexual division of labor. (To the extent that this whole mating picture depends on the sexual division of labor, a cultural phenomenon, it might indi- cate the emergence of culture before vital statistics evolved so divergently from those of the prehominids.) Brother-Sister. In Chart 1, assuming that all the offspring live to maturity, and assuming that the first two adjacent siblings are of opposite sex, the sec- ond a male, by the time the male reaches puberty his sister will already have a suckling child. If the first child is the male, his sister will not be able to bear his child until he has already had at least six breeding years behind him. During these six years, chances are that because of the division of labor, he will already be tied to providing for another woman or series of them. Such are the conditions with only four years' difference in age. With a difference of eight years, as between the first and third siblings, there is half the chance of establishing an intrafamily child-rearing-and-labor unit. The possibility of relations between the first and sixth child are even more remote than parent-first-child unions, for there is a twenty-year gap between their ages. If the first and third children live, with a preweaning death of the intervening sibling, there is at least a six-year gap between the oldest and next oldest children. Even in the case of twins, the chances of incest are one divided by all the other eligible potential mates in the society. If there are one female and four males, the population would increase</page><page sequence="16">SLATER] The Origin of Incest 1057 only as if there were one pair. Nor would the one female be able to produce the maximum number of children if she were the first or last child, unless outside mates entered. If the children are preponderantly female, the children of those without exclusive male partners would die. In all diadal interactions mentioned, most sex-and-labor units would be outside the family. The probability of the occurrence of incestuous unions, as we have shown, is the lowest for mother-son relationships. Next in order of frequency is father-daughter and the highest probable frequency is between siblings. Interestingly, these frequencies are mirrored in the ethnographic record of the incidence of positively sanctioned incest relations. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION Levi-Strauss, as we quoted earlier, thinks the reason human organisms first began mating outside the family was that incest prohibitions existed, for he believes that animal life knows no rule in mating and procreation. But animal mating follows whatever "rules" its biological statistics reveal. Animals that are not born in litters, that must be suckled for about three years (instead of the chimpanzee's 18-21 months), that do not reach maturity for a decade and a half (unlike the macaque at three and a half and the chimp at eight years and eleven months [Hooton 1949:251]), and animals that die after some 25 or 35 years-such animals would almost always mate outside the family for most of their breeding life. The reason, we maintain, is that these animals are born in families that break up with the relatively early death of the parent couple. Among the siblings or half-siblings, the mating system is weighted in the direction of out-breeding because of the age distribution and the 50 percent chance of the birth order yielding two like-sexed adjacent siblings. Additional weights are offered by the fact that any child has only at most a 50 percent chance of surviving the first few months. In short, under the most primitive conditions, where there is only a sexual division of labor, the probability of producing and rearing children is proportionate to the parity in ages of the parents. Most intrafamily breeding units, as we have seen, are always impossible: those between the mother and four of her five children; those between the father and three or perhaps four of his daughters; those between the oldest and youngest of six children. Even when parent-child breeding units are possible, they would last only long enough to produce the female parent's last child and the daughter's first child or two. Even with age and viability permitting, parent-child unions could occur only if the oldest child happened to be of the right sex. Most of the siblings most of the time would be bound to outside mates. It is, I suggest, around such patterns of interaction that all marriage rules crystallized, almost all of them showing an absence of sanctioned intranuclear matings. When in time cultures produced sufficient surplus or in other ways changed their ecology to the extent of shifting the balance in vital statistics, they either created rules permitting some incest (e.g., Egyptian royalty) or established prohibitions against it. I also suggest as probable that the earliest</page><page sequence="17">1058 A merican A nthropologist [61, 1959 hominids were able to commit incest even less frequently, perhaps not at all. I have taken several steps in advancing my suggestions. First, I empha- sized the inadequacy, in my opinion, of present hypotheses to account for the origin of certain universal mating patterns, although they explain later stages in the development of the culture complex. Then I offered the only type of substitute hypothesis compatible with the theory that value follows action. This new hypothesis contains, so to speak, a Copernican twist: Cooperative bonds were determined by mating patterns, not vice versa. And these mating patterns were ecologically determined: in brief, by the time the children are of an age to mate, their parents would most likely be dead. There was nuclear exogamy. Eventually, changing ecology made it possible to break this external system, but it was functionally impossible to change the institutions that had become enmeshed with it. Next I tried to see what hints could be found in current societies to support these inferences, and found evidence for the frequency postulate of interaction theory: In the simplest ecologies, most of the people most of the time mate out, not in order to survive, but in order to mate at all. A thorough re-examination of the ethnographic data in the light of this theory would be interesting, since a brief glance yielded the following three cases that may now be put in perspective. Hoebel reports that the Plains Indians think incest neither a crime nor a sin, but impossible. The Comanche cannot recall any case of incest, nor can they conceive of a public reaction to it (1949:195) which indicates that they have no taboo, but simply an absence of incest. Among the Tallensi, according to Meyer Fortes, father-daughter and brother-sister incest are "shameful, but not subject to supernatural penalties" (1936:246). But the idea of incest with one's mother, he reports, if suggested by the anthropologist, produces nothing but an incredulous laugh. It is said to be unthinkable in view of the fact that an adult male's mother is always an old woman. Sex relations between old and young people, it may be objected, seem fre- quent enough in primitive societies where, for example, a nephew marries his classificatory father's sister or his mother's brother's wife. However, in one society where these intergenerational marriages were studied, the Tikopia, Firth shows that the partners are about the same age. ". . . Rivers' sugges- tion," says Firth, "that marriages which are anomalous in terms of kinship status of the parties who unite are necessarily between persons of disparate age as well is not borne out" (1936: 267). He continues: "The marriage of people of approximately the same age but of disparate kinship grades tends to level out . . . discrepancies in terminology."
