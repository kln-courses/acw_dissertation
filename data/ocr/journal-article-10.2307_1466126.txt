<plain_text><page sequence="1">Faces in the Clouds: A New Theory of Religion. By Stewart Elliott Guthrie. Oxford University Press, 1993. 290 pages. $30.00 cloth; $14.95 paper. With few exceptions, the implicit assumptions about religion current among scholars in the field of religious studies can be traced back to Mircea Eli- ade, Rudolph Otto, the theorists who flourished in Weimar Germany, and even earlier to Friedrich Schleiermacher, their conceptual tools consisting largely of unexamined terms such as 'experience,' 'the sacred,' 'the numinous,' homo reli- giosus, and 'meaning.' More recently, however, authors such as Lawson, McCau- ley, and Boyer, influenced to some extent by Robin Horton, have emphasized the role of cognition in the genesis of religion. One of the latest contributions to this approach is Faces in the Clouds, a book in which Stewart Elliott Guthrie develops the ideas he originally presented in "A Cognitive Theory of Religion" (Current Anthropology 212, 1980). For Guthrie, "the progenitors of religion are our perceptual uncertainties and our need to see any people who are present ... All religions do share a fea- ture: ostensible communication with humanlike, yet nonhuman, beings through some form of symbolic action" (197). The question about the persistence of reli- gion, changed into the question about the persistence of humanlike models, is answered thus: "Humanlike models persist because they identify and account for the crucial component of the world: humans and their activities and effects ... In sum, religion arises and persists because the strategy from which it stems often succeeds in identifying phenomena-real humans and their actions that</page><page sequence="2">458 Journal of the American Academy of Religion are uniquely important" (201). In the context of survival, and of the need to choose among interpretations in order to make survival possible, anthropomor- phism is "neither peculiar nor unreasonable," but rather "a plausible, though in hindsight mistaken, interpretation of things and events" (64). By emphasizing cognition and significance in the context of interests and needs (188 and pas- sim), Guthrie makes a contribution to the study of religion and provides a valu- able corrective to theories centered upon meaning and experience (his critique on pp. 27-32 of C. Geertz's vacuous notion of meaning is most welcome). Because of his interest in cognition, particularly those forms not mediated by language, and his recognition that interpretations, however rich and mean- ingful, may be mistaken (a perfectly sensible position that unfortunately would be anathema to many social scientists influenced by postmodernism), one could expand Guthrie's research and explore, along with Maurice Bloch, the connec- tions between cognition and ideology. Unfortunately, and surprisingly for a social scientist, Guthrie does not seem to be concerned with the role society and social interests may have in shaping cognitive process. For instance, he neglects the cognitive function of social representations emphasized by Drukheim and Mauss in their essay on primitive classification, first published in 1903. Similarly, while attempting to put in their place sociological theories of religion he writes, "Nor is religion necessarily social ... Religious hermits in such traditions as Christianity, Hinduism, and Japanese folk religion emphasize the role of iso- lation" (18, emphasis added). Is it possible, however, to study isolation apart from the societies, or from the 'traditions' within which it appears, or without taking into consideration the social functions of hermits? But even remaining with the issues that Guthrie sets out to explore, one finds extraordinary omissions. There is very little about the gender of gods and also about those divine figures that seem to embody the desire to transcend the limitations of gender, either through androgyny or sexlessness. There is no dis- cussion, and hardly any mention, of polytheism, surely the form of religion in which it is almost impossible to deprive gods of their anthropomorphic (or sometimes theriomorphic) characteristics. In view of these absences several questions come to mind: What is the cognitive function of pantheons on the one hand and of single gods on the other? Is it perhaps the case that mono- theistic religions are more likely to deanthromorphize their gods? How is the problem of iconoclasm to be understood? Can one possibly relate the last two issues to some form of religious and social evolution? Is there, on the other hand, a dialectical relationship between our apparent proclivity to perceive non-human realities in anthropomorphic terms, and the reverse process, by which one per- ceives human beings in divine terms? Do the cognitive processes described by Guthrie help us to understand phenomena such as divine kingship, or the di- vinization of human beings which is common enough, particularly in Chinese religions? What are the connections, if any, between anthropomorphism and the religious legitimation of political structures? Can one place Guthrie's re- search in the larger context of the biomorphic, technomorphic and socio- morphic explanatory models developed by Ernst Topitsch (beginning in 1958 with Vom Ursprung und Ende der Metaphysik)? Returning to the issue of poly- theism vs. monotheism: Should one agree with Burkhard Gladigow, when he claims that the separation of god from domain has its parallel in changing forms of subjectivity and political legitimation? Do pantheons, generally orga-</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 459 nized in a hierarchical fashion, provide models for political arrangements and certain types of perception? Can the opposition between groups of gods help us to understand social conflicts? (Gladigow's relevant articles, containing some of the most insightful ideas in the field of religious studies, can be found in Der Name Gottes, ed. H. von Stietencron, 1975; Gottesvorstellung und Gesellschaftsent- wicklung, ed. P. Eicher, 1979; Wort und Bild, ed. H. Brunner et al., 1979; Saecu- lum 34, 1983; Handbuch religionswissenschaftlicher Grundbergriffe III, 1993 s.v. "Gottesvorstellungen"). Too many questions perhaps. But without expecting Guthrie to write a book that conforms to Topitsch's, Gladigow's, or to anyone else's research pro- gram, one is justified in expecting to find these issues, if not explored in detail, and certainly not solved, at least mentioned, especially when one reads a book that claims to provide no less than a new theory of religion, and when consider- ing further the length of the book under review. Indeed, Guthrie gives the impression of having taken too much to heart a suggestion made by one of the critics of "A Cognitive Theory of Religion" (Current Anthropology 21, 1980, 198), and having spent two hundred pages (plus another seventy of notes and bibliography) in what could have been said in a hundred or less. Some of the chapters, particularly chapter 5, "Anthropomorphism in the Arts," and chapter 6, "Anthropomorphism in Philosophy and Science," and to a lesser extent chap- ter 4, "Anthropomorphism as Perception," could have been shortened sub- stantially or even eliminated without making the author's argument any less compelling; in fact, it would not be unfair to say that the multiplication of examples tends to dilute the points the author wishes to make and transforms the book into a kind of encyclopedia of anthropomorphism. What could have been substantially expanded in the space devoted to the study of the social con- straints of cognition, including the problem of ideology. Despite all these caveats-raised, it should be stressed, by a reviewer who is sympathetic to Guthrie's position-this book is to be welcomed for its am- bition, for its attempting to provide a cognition theory of religion, and for its emphasizing the role of practical concerns in the genesis of religion. Since cog- nition may indeed be one of the keys to understanding religion, Faces in the Clouds, not least because of its readability and commonsense approach, will ful- fill an important role. But this is only a first step, one that may entice its readers to engage in a serious study of cognitive science and to become acquainted with research in languages other than English-research that is routinely disre- garded by North American scholars (and reviewed only sporadically in English- language journals).
