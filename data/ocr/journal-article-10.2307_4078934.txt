<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vol. 58] Recent Literature 1941 RECENT LITERATURE Bent's 'Life Histories of North American Birds.'-This latest volume' of the celebrated 'Life Histories' contains the available information concerning 59 forms of parrots, cuckoos, trogons, kingfishers, goatsuckers, swifts, and hummingbirds. It follows the same plan as the previous issues, treating each species or subspecies under the topics of spring, courtship, nesting, eggs, young, plumage, food, be- havior, voice, enemies, autumn, field marks, and distribution. For many species information is not available concerning various topics. Taxonomic problems are not considered. The biographies of the several species mention many interesting facts. The discussion of the Carolina Parakeet points out the destructive feeding habits of the birds and, important in comparison with other kinds of parakeets, the probability that our species nested in colonies, sometimes apparently building large nests of sticks. There is also a short discussion of the Mexican parrot, Rhynchopsitta. The chapters on the two species of Ani and the Roadrunner abstract most of the available information although several references are omitted. For example, Gund- lach long ago (1874) exploded the myth that the Anis lay their eggs in layers; Chapman (1938) wrote an accurate chapter on Crotophaga ani and Hartley (1917) studied its development. Our two North American cuckoos are discussed at length. However, the classic work of Herrick (1910) is not mentioned, although some of his extensive data are contained in the 1935 reference. The life histories of two Asiatic cuckoos by E. C. S. Baker contain much unpublished data and clearly point out the territorialism in these species. The only North American trogon is mentioned briefly. The chapters on the two Central American king- fishers add perspective to his excellent account of the Belted Kingfisher. The territorialism and long incubation period are notable. A comparison of the life histories of the Whippoorwill, Nighthawks and allies indicates the uniformity of habits within the group. A comprehensive chapter on the Chimney Swift is accompanied by chapters on the western species and on one Asiatic form. Within the group there is a striking contrast between the uniformity of flight and feed- ing habits on the one hand and the variation in nesting habits on the other hand. The chapters on the hummingbirds are a most useful compilation of informa- tion. The nesting habits are uniform throughout the group. The male ordinarily does not take part in the nest activities, although there is evidence that the male Broad-billed Hummingbird incubates. Two eggs are laid by all the species dis- cussed. The behavior of several species indicates that the male has a courtship and a feeding territory and that the female has a nesting and a food territory. Saunders' (1936) recognition of this fact is omitted. Interspecific fighting is spectacular throughout the group. Arnold's (p. 372) description of breast to breast coition is questionable. The erroneous statement (p. 422) that "the court- ship performances of the hummingbirds all follow the same general pattern" is correctly contradicted by the splendid generalizations of Skutch (p. 433) concern- ing the 'static' and 'dynamic' types of courtship. In static courtship the birds gather singly or in assemblies to display from one particular spot. The dynamic I Bent, Arthur Cleveland.

It is of interest that no temperate species uses the static type although this type is widespread throughout Central and even South America (Phaethornis and Pygmornis). The discussion of two tropical species by Skutch supplies much unpublished information. The chapter on the Ruby-throat describes the courtship and gives an analysis of the flight, as photographed by high-speed cameras. Since this volume discusses several difficult families, some brief generalizations and analyses of the groups would be a desirable improvement. Further, while many of us decry the tendency to consider ornithology as no more than the study of territorialism, nevertheless the topic is of sufficient importance to merit a separate section in the life-history discussions. Thus the observations of Bullock in 1825 (p. 431) and of Henslow in 1877 (p. 416) on territorialism are obscured in the description of other topics. A refreshing feature is the wealth of data gathered from the older literature, indicating the author's familiarity with his subject. At times the point of view is too anthropomorphic. Others vie with modern authors in verbosity. The description of field marks is good, but at the present time probably superfluous in a book of this nature. The volume contains 135 excellent photographs, a detailed table of contents and an index to species and authors but not to subjects. The ten pages of bibliography unfortunately do not give the name of the publisher of the books included. This volume provides the basis for detailed life-history studies and exposes the deficiencies in our knowledge of many species.-D. E. DAVIS.</page></plain_text>
