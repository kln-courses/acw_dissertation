<plain_text><page sequence="1">Comment and Discussion FEIGL ON INTUITION P. T. RAJU PROFESSOR FEIGL'S CRITIQUE of intuition is not a rejection of intuitive experience but of its validity as knowledge. Or, rather, it is a rejection of intuition as a form of knowledge. Again, it is the mystic in- tuition that is rejected along with any philosophy that is based upon it, for intuition has many meanings, such as clairvoyance, hunch, etc., which Feigl accepts. Apparently, Feigl did not read my article, "Intuition as a Philosophical Method in India"2; otherwise, the conclusion he arrived at, namely, "it simply does not make sense to ascribe truth or falsity to im- mediate experience itself,"' and the statement "intuition (in the sense of direct experience) is neither rational nor irrational,"4 would have been noticed by him as mentioned in my paper, for even those who accept intui- tion as a form of knowing maintain, as do the Naiyiyikas, that non-discur- sive knowledge is neither true nor false.5 The Naiyiyikas drew a distinc- tion between indeterminate and determinate cognition, which is somewhat similar to the distinction between immediate experience and description of immediate experience or acquaintance and knowledge by acquaintance" drawn by Feigl.7 Further, I contended in my paper that intuition by itself had never been used as a philosophical method in India and could never be so used in the East or the West for building up a metaphysical system.

SFeigl, op. cit., p. 9. 4Raju, op. cit., p. 195. 5Ibid. 6Feigl, op. cit., p. 9. 7I hesitate to accept the view that acquaintance is the same as indeterminate cognition. See L.S. Stebbing, A Modern Introduction to Logic (London: Methuen and Company, 1950), p. 24, foot- note. Acquaintance is not immediate experience; but indeterminate cognition is. My acquaintance with Mr. Nehru is with an object with a definite form. But a thoroughly unmediated experience is without any form. There have been differences of view on this point even in Indian philosophy. For instance, Riminuja thinks that even indeterminate cognition has a definite form; this is really Russell's knowledge by acquaintance. The Advaitins follow the Naiyiyikas. 149</page><page sequence="2">150 P. T. RAJU religious insight,8 Feigl says, always needs the help of discursive reason- ing. Insight is insight into the relationships of a plurality and is relational, rational, and discursive. But I attempted to show that this relational knowl- edge is permeated by intuitive knowledge also and is based upon it, for even rational insight is insight into the meaning of existential forms. I do not know whether this point is acceptable to Feigl or not; if it is not, then metaphysics for him cannot be a rational insight into what one ex- periences directly. However, all this applies to the role of intuition in empirical knowledge. But what is its role in the trans-empirical knowledge of the mystic? Or, does he have no knowledge at all, but only live his experience?9 It is here that the mystic takes issue. Feigl says that mystic experience cannot be called knowledge, because it is not descriptive and communicable. But, first, how is my experience of the pen in front of me communicable? Can my experience be transferred to another person? I can only make him have a similar, but not the same, experience. In the second place, in some cases I cannot even make him have similar experiences, but can only make him understand. Suppose I have a tooth- ache, but without any external symptom. A boy who has never had a tooth- ache cannot even imagine that experience, though I describe it. He may understand it by analogy to a stomachache or a headache, and may even have sympathy for me. The case of the boy who is born blind but who understands colors when light waves are transformed into sound waves is similar. He can never be made to experience colors. For him, they are hypothetical entities corresponding to different sounds. He understands them as we understand the letters a, b, c, etc., in algebra. They are only symbolic. But the mystic experience is not symbolic, though the mystic may describe it symbolically, often in negative terms. In the third place, can I communicate my experience of the pen in front of me if my experience is not conscious? If my acquaintance with it also is conscious, why should we not call it knowledge? Here I am speaking of acquaintance, but not of what the Naiyayikas call indeterminate per- ceptual knowledge. When I am acquainted with the pen, my physical body is not in contact with the physical pen; my physical eyeball is not in touch with it either; nor does the acquaintance consist of the mere passing of light rays from the pen into my eye. In this case, also, there is no acquaint- ance, which is an awareness, a consciousness of the object by my mind. 'Feigl, op. cit, p. 16. 9Ibid., p. 9.</page><page sequence="3">FEIGL ON INTUITION 151 Even if that consciousness is not as definite as "pen" but as mere "some- thing," which is indefinite and indeterminate, it is awareness or knowledge. We say, then, that this knowledge is logically insignificant, because, when I say, "I see something," there is no possibility of denial. Even if it is a hallucination, it is "something." But if I say, "It is a man," there is a pos- sibility of denial, for the object may not be a man, but a pillar or lamp post. But the "something" is always a "something." And my knowledge of "something" is also knowledge. If indeterminate knowledge is knowl- edge, a fortiori, acquaintance is also knowledge. Does Russell mean by "knowledge by acquaintance" "knowledge by acquaintance including des- cription"? For him, also, there can be knowledge by acquaintance without any description. In the fourth place, we therefore have to ask: If my acquaintance is not knowledge, how can I describe it? I can describe only what is known by me. Of course, what is known by me may also be lived by me. In some cases, what is lived by me is not known by me, for instance, the involuntary pro- cesses of my nervous, digestive, and muscular systems, and my unconscious memories. But these processes are not part of my experience. Experiences which are lived by me are also known by me. Acquaintance is such an ex- perience. Hence, to deny that mystic experience is knowledge is not justified. It may be objected that the above discussion is only about terminology, namely, whether the mystic experience is to be called knowledge or not, and is therefore unimportant. What is important is that it has no connec- tion with other experiences or forms of knowledge, that it cannot be con- firmed by other forms of knowledge, as my clairvoyant knowledge that my house at a distance of six hundred miles is on fire can be confirmed by ringing up the fire brigade at that place. Clairvoyant knowledge is true or false, but mystic experience is neither since it cannot be confirmed in that way. Feigl admits the occurrence of mystic experiences,'0 such as clairvoyant experiences, but doubts their interpretation. The aim of his criticism seems to be double-edged. He seems to say that mystic experience, though it occurs, cannot claim to be true knowledge, because it cannot be verified by non-mystic methods, that is, according to him, by methods of scientific empiricism; and also that the philosophical interpretation of mystic intuiton to the effect that it gives metaphysical insight into the es- sential nature of reality is false or at least irrational. I should think that these points are separate, for, if there are mystic experiences, and, if they are had by the same person who has other experiences also, they have to 'Olbid., p. 7.</page><page sequence="4">152 P. T. RAJU be related philosophically to his total experience; and by this relating he gains insight into the totality of his experience and being. If dream ex- periences throw light on the mind of the person, as psychoanalysts claim, then much more assuredly does mystic experience throw light on his deeper being. If there is something in our being that is susceptible to mystic experience, then it must belong to our being even though it is not possible to verify it by the methods of scientific empiricism. But is it a justifiable demand that mystic experience should be capable of being verified by methods of non-mystic scientific empiricism? Empiri- cism itself is a vague idea. If it means a philosophy of experience, then mystic experience, also being experience, should be capable of being included in it. If it means a philosophy of experience confined to the physi- cal world, then it excludes much that is humanly important. It has been shown that the methods of studying the physical world are not applicable even to the biological world, much less to that of the pychological and the spiritual. Have all psychologists accepted the view that behaviorism has succeeded in explaining thought-processes? Yet, behaviorism wants to be "scientific." One may as well demand-and it has been demanded- that the addition of consciousness to the physical body must make a differ- ence to the weight of the latter! What does the mystic mean when he says that his knowledge is true? He means that he actually had the experience, that his ordinary being was transformed in it, that he had no possibility of even doubting whether it was true or false, that his personality had a feeling of complete satisfaction, and that in that experience he had no consciousness of the ordinary world. Mystic experience is an inward experience, not knowledge of an external object the reality of which can be tested by others in other ways. The mystic does not say that his experience cannot be had by others; others can have it, provided they follow the same methods for arousing it. It is true in the sense that it can be had all who want it. It is true in the sense that it belongs to our deeper inward being. If Freud's psychoanalysis is "rational," then the analysis of our inward being also can be rational. If Freud gives a "rational" explanation of the "irrational," then the philos- ophy of mysticism can give a rational explanation of the supra-rational. If the meaning of "scientific empiricism" can be made to cover Freud's analy- sis,," then it can be made to cover also the analysis of mystic experience. 11I do not refer to Freud's explanation of the concept of God as Father or Mother, but only to his theory of the unconscious. For the sake of the present argument, it is not necessary to accept or reject the theory.</page><page sequence="5">FEIGL ON INTUITION 153 But to explain it will not be the same as verifying it in other ways or ex- plaining it away as an illusion. Feigl seems to have overlooked the fact that many mystics do not call God by the name "Father" or "Mother," but describe the experience as inexplicable, indescribable, and so on. He is not clear as to what metaphysical position based upon religious experience he is attacking, for there are many even in the West. He speaks of "religious realists,"12 but that term also does not convey a definite meaning. He says also that "metaphysical or religious insight" cannot be obtained from mystic intuition."3 But this term also does not mean anything definite. Had he denied the occurrences of mystical experience, it would have been easy to fix his position. I may interpret him, therefore, as meaning that mystic experience or intuition is of no use in the obtaining of philosophical insight. But if mystic experience is admitted and man is capable of having such an experience (as he is of having a clairvoyant experience), should we not say that it belongs to the nature of man? Should we not study it, then, if we are to understand fully the being of man? Will not a philosophy of man that does not consider it be inadequate and incomplete and give an incorrect picture of man? If "scientific humanism" is to make a proper study of clairvoyance, etc., should it not also make a proper study of mystic experience and include it? Or, does the adjective "scientific" exclude mystic experience? If so, science must admit that there are experiences beyond its powers of study. But the world, even if it is independent of man's experience, must be understood via the medium of his experience. If this is anthropomorphism, then not even the scientist can avoid it. He can explain the natural forces only as man can understand and explain them. Then, for philosophy it is as necessary to explain man's nature in terms of its correlation to the objec- tive world as it is necessary to explain the objective world in terms of the forms of experience man can have. At one extreme, namely, that of atoms, electrons, protons, etc., man's sense experience is transcended, and correla- tion with his direct experiences is given up. Similarly, at the other extreme of mystic experience, correlation with physical objects is transcended. But if both extremes are developments out of man's experience in two direc- tions, can no philosophical insight be gained into the nature of man by considering both? And is it not necessary to consider both? Psychoanalysts tell us that a perverse unconscious can affect even our ordinary perceptions " Feigl, op. cit., p. 13. 13lbid., p. 16.</page><page sequence="6">154 P. T. RAJU and therefore our reality attitudes. This means that, for a proper reality attitude, the depths of our mind should be healthy. Similarly, if the mystic core of our being is actual, as Feigl admits, is it not necessary for us to study it and say when it is healthy and when not? If it is actual, it must be present in every man, whether he is aware of it or not. Then a study of its nature becomes as much a part of philosophy as the study of his other forms of experience. If through the latter forms of experience we decide about the nature of reality, it is important to determine how the mystic form is related to them. If the mystic form is deeper than the others, then the reality attributed to mystic experience may be at the root of the realities attributed to the other experiences. Perhaps Feigl's difficulty is due to the usual confusing of the mystic ex- perience with arguments like the cosmological and the teleological for the existence of God. If the mystic knows God, and if God is the causa sui of the world, does the mystic when he knows God know him as the cause of the world?'" And does he therefore establish the reality of God as the cause of the world, therein using his intuition for metaphysics? No mystic philosopher in India has done this. Many, e. g., Saxhkara, did not even ac- cept the usual arguments for the existence of God. Those who accepted them did not confuse them with mysticism. Then, what metaphysical in- sight did the mystic experience provide? The insights are many. The most important is that the mystic experience at its highest and purest is deeply inward to man and is the ground of all other experiences including sense experience. And it is of the highest value, because at least after death man ought to be one with it if he is to enter into a blessed and blissful state. And because it is the ground of all other experiences, they can be under- stood best with reference to it. Even if these philosophies are not acceptable, the experience gives a deeper insight into the being of man as pointed out in the above paragraph. One special point may be mentioned here about mysticism in Indian philosophy. A distinction is made between true and false mysticism. The mystic gets his experience in trance (samulhi). The SiTrhkhya-Yoga, for instance, speaks of absorption in primeval matter (prakrti) Deep sleep undisturbed by dream is also like trance. In both cases, man is not con- scious. And even in cases in which man is conscious, there are various stages of trance, in all of which there are mystic experiences. The highest or the deepest of these is the realization of God or the Absolute. But man may mistake any of the others for this. So, the ideas of truth and falsity are 1"In the Aristotelian sense of the word "cause."</page><page sequence="7">FEIGL ON INTUITION 155 applicable to mystic experiences also. In order to know which is true and which is false, mystic literature describes their characteristics. These stages are stages of man's inward being. Can scientific humanism or scientific empiricism, in the narrow sense of the term, test their existence? The methods of objective experience, as the existentialists contend, are not ap- plicable to inward experience. How can what cannot be sensed be tested by sense experience? How can what may not even express itself in sense experience be tested by it? The test can be man's inward experience alone. And the use of mystic experience is man's realization of his inwardness and its freedom. Feigl says that the experience itself is not irrational. Then, also, the use to which it is put need not be irrational. After all, the selfsame conscious- ness of man passes through all stages, from the objective empirical to the deepest mystical, and is continuous through them, just as it is continuous through the states of waking, dream, and deep sleep. But the objects of the three states are not continuous. Then, how can the experiences of the one be tested by the experiences of the other? Similarly, when man's con- sciousness in some of the stages of its inwardness gets detached from the objects of the external world, how can the external world be a test of those inward states? If it cannot be a test, should scientific empiricism re- ject their reality or their usefulness for a proper understanding of man? As man's consciousness passes through those states, when it returns from them to the ordinary empirical level, he interrelates them, just as he interrelates his dream and sleep states with his waking state. And this act of interrelat- ing is rational, and is the work of his reason. It may be noted that certain physical effects are observed when a man goes into trance. He can live without food, water, and even air for days at a time. Some of the yogis of India have given demonstrations by burying themselves for days. Some have swallowed deadlist poisons without being harmed;'5 they are able to do this by complete control of the involuntary system and by preventing the digestive fluids from coming into contact with the swallowed poisons. This is an indication of the freedom of man's con- sciousness from the physical and vital systems of the body and is a disproof of consciousness as a quality of the body. Even if one yogi can live for a day without air, we have some evidence for the independence of life from matter. These examples are meant to show that so-called scientific empiricism '1This is not done in trance but in the ordinary waking state. But the case is mentioned in order to show the peculiar nature of our being, which can be made in some ways independent of the laws of physiology.</page><page sequence="8">156 P. T. RAJU or science as it is now understood is not sufficient to explain man's being and has no right to reject what it cannot explain. On the other hand, these demonstrations are not sufficient to prove that the yogis have God-realiza- tion. They might have been able to attain some of the lower forms of trance or a certain amount of freedom from the laws of matter and life. Whether this realization is God-realization can be known by the yogis themselves if at all, and by others who have that realization. Even in the case of the lower realizations, a few external effects can be tested by scientific methods; what the yogis actually experience remains only symbolic to us, and they themselves must tell us what they experience. Feigl requires that the mystic experience be capable of being tested by empirical methods. But what will these methods test? Let us, for argu- ment's sake, agree that the mystic has an experience of God. Let us also agree that God is the world ground sustaining the universe. But, even after the mystic experience, the world goes on as usual. If my cognition of the pen in front of me does not change the pen, the mystic's knowledge of the world ground does not change the world either. No change occurs in the world after the mystic's realization except in the experience and the outlook of the mystic. The only test, therefore, can be by his own experience. Yet, this experience should not be dismissed as valueless either for man or for philosophy. For man, it provides a new understanding of himself and a new outlook. It gives him an experiential basis for communion with the Divine Spirit. The discovery of the deeper levels of his consciousness clari- fies for him the nature of his ethical consciousness,'6 that is, the ability of his conscious being to transcend his egoistic particularity. The so-called mystic practices, if they are truly spiritual, should enable man to reach these levels and be steadfast in them. But, unfortunately, there are all kinds of practices passing for mystic experiences, for instance, the trance introduced by drugs. If true mystic experience is God-realization, and vice versa, then God has to be explained as the Spirit within the spirit of man; otherwise, communion with God could not have been possible. This is a philosophical insight. Whether the two spirits are one and the same or similar but different is a question about which philosophers have disagreed both in India and the West. But there can be no communion and no mystic experience that can be called divine if God is like the God of Aristotle or the deists, keeping aloof from the world processes he started or created. He must be immanent in man's "*This point was discussed in my paper, "Religion and Spiritual Values in Indian Thought," contributed to the Third East-West Philosophers' Conference.</page><page sequence="9">FEIGL ON INTUITION 157 conscious being if communion is to be possible. Now, making the con- sciousness of man central to philosophy, several systems have been devel- oped both in India and the West. They have always been more or less idealistic, giving primacy to spirit; and many of them are realistic in epistemology. It is true that this method of approach is not suited to the explanation of the structure of an independent material world. But, equal- ly, we have to note, the method of explanation suited to the material world is not suited to the understanding of the inward being of man. We have to recognize the validity of each and find a way of co-ordinating and cor- relating them. This can be done through proper co-operation of Eastern and Western philosophers. Matter and consciousness exist as co-ordinated and correlated in man. Mystic experience baffles scientific empiricism and shows its inadequacy. From the purely outward point of view, for those who do not have mystic experience, the method to be used is not that of scientific testing, but postula- tional technique. But this can give only plausibility, not direct experience. When direct experience is not had, there can be several speculative philos- ophies as there can be several hypotheses. Direct experience cannot be pro- duced by the methods of scientific empiricism; and mystic experience cannot be tested by them, unless the meanings of the words "scientific" and "em- piricism" are made wide enough. After all, scientific methods are not to be a priori determined, but must be made suitable to the kind of reality they are to study. Feigl refers to Einstein's conception-of God as the order or rationality of Nature as a good example of his method of approach to intuition."7 But do we not find it in the Greek conception of the Logos and the Indian concep- tion of Mahan Atma (the Cosmic Person, Cosmic Reason)? Suppose, then, that God as the Divine Spirit is immanent in the order of the totality of Nature. Similarly, the consciousness of the individual, particularly his ra- tionality, is immanent in his physical body and forms with it something like an integral unity. Is there nothing in man, then, that corresponds to Cosmic Reason? If man is part of Nature, if reason in man corresponds to reason in Nature, then has his reason nothing to do with Cosmic Reason? To a man with only a "scientific outlook" these questions may appear only speculative. But to the questioning philosopher as well as to the mystic they are questions about man's existence and its nature. One difficulty with the so-called "scientific outlook" or "rational outlook" in Western philosophy is that it has never taken man's consciousness serious- "Feigl, op. cit., p. 15.</page><page sequence="10">158 P. T. RAJU ly, on the ground that our consciousness of objects makes no difference to the objects. But our consciousness of ourselves does make a difference to our existence; for, if we are not conscious of ourselves, we cease to exist, though the objects do not cease to exist even if we are not conscious of them. For man himself, it is his conscious being or the being of his con- sciousness that matters most. Its importance is directly realized in the em- pirical world in ethical and aesthetic activities. In pure science it is treated like a mirror reflecting objects as they are, and not affecting the nature of their existence. But man's existence also is consciousness. Rdmdnuja, an In- dian Veddntin, speaks of two kinds of consciousness, the existential con- sciousness and the attribute consciousness. I should like to call the latter projective consciousness, because in the mystic experience of one's self, it can be withdrawn into existential consciousness. The distinction is that be- tween consciousness of my existence and the consciousness I possess of ex- ternal objects. I am the former; but I have the latter. The latter presents objects as they are and does not transform their nature in the process. It is this consciousness which the scientific philosophers consider and treat as unimportant for scientific purposes. They ignore existential consciousness altogether. And this cannot even be known through scientific methods. It has now asserted its presence with a vengeance in the several forms of European existentialism. Feigl says that he keeps an open mind"s to these problems. Then he should also keep an open mind about the methods of study, without limiting them to the "scientific" as usually understood. Other- wise, to say that every form of knowledge, if true, must be capable of being tested by other forms of knowledge will be dogmatic. There are experi- ences which can be so tested, but others which cannot. Experience and knowledge are not limited to one type. If indeterminate knowledge of ex- ternal objects is useless as a truth, it does not follow that indeterminate knowledge of inward reality is also useless as a truth. Again, if we accept Einstein's idea that God is reason in Nature, and, if God is Spirit, how can scientific tests establish that reason in Nature is Spirit? The real question is: What is the specific field of intuition and what is that of reason? In part they overlap." This is due to man's being and hav- ing more than one kind of consciousness. In the transcendent objective field of atoms, electrons, etc., everything is posited by reason. Similarly, in the transcendent subjective field everything is experienced intuitively. And philosophy in its epistemology should study at what points and how they is Ibid., p. 16. "See my "Intuition as a Philosophical Method In India."</page><page sequence="11">FEIGL ON INTUITION 159 overlap and interpenetrate, and at what points they do not. But man's con- sciousness in one form or another is continuous through all. Feigl has not examined the psychological and epistemological processes of reason and intuition. Had he done this, he would have seen that the mystic's intuition is not supernatural. Feigl uses the words "naturalism," "rationalism," "scientific humanism" and "scientific empiricism." But if mys- tic intuition is a fact-as he admits-then it is as natural as any other fact and must be as capable of scientific and rational explanation. But, if we delimit the meanings of the words "natural," "scientific," and "rational," then mystic experience must be treated as supernatural or as a freak of Nature. Then science, dangerously to man, will be narrowed down to the realm of physical objects. After the above comment on Feigl's main contention, I may make a few observations on some of his other incidental views, not necessarily to criticize them, but to clarify them as far as I understand them. (1) How is intuition a way of knowing? Feigl distinguishes between acquaintance and knowledge by acquaintance, and says that, if intuition is only acquaintance, it cannot be knowledge. Here I take the word "intui- tion" in the sense of acquaintance, not in the sense of indeterminate cogni- tion of objects. Let us take the example of clairvoyance. X says: "The house is on fire," and communicates this to Y. X has acquaintance, first, with "the house on fire," and then communicates it by the proposition, "The house is on fire." Then, is this communicable proposition knowledge, but not ac- quaintance with the "house on fire"? If he has no knowledge at the time of acquaintance, what can he communicate? Suppose he does not want to com- municate and does not make the proposition; then does he have no knowl- edge? Is not knowledge involved in acquaintance itself? Or, does Feigl mean by acquaintance simple awareness of sense-contact without the mind's fixing the object as something definite? But there is no sense-contact in clairvoyance. If mind knows the object directly without the senses by devel- oping the object somehow, then it knows the object as a definite something. Let us leave out clairvoyance, and take the example of the pen in front of me. I am acquainted with the pen. The object is the pen. This acquaint- ance, it is said, is not knowledge. If the object is "This is a pen," then it is knowledge, because it can be communicated. But if my acquaintance is not knowledge, how can I make the assertion, "This is a pen"? In this in- stance, it may be said that during acquaintance my sense of vision is in contact</page><page sequence="12">160 P. T. RAJU with the object, but my mind is not there. But, if so, my acquaintance could not have been with "the pen" but with "something." Knowledge by ac- quaintance, Russell says, is with individuals, and so acquaintance must be with individuals. The individual here is "the pen," a fixed determinate object, not a mere "something," not even a mere color. Otherwise, acquaint- ance will be absolutely indeterminate, and knowledge by acquaintance will be the same as indeterminate knowledge. Nor can we say that, when my eyesight is fixed on the object, my mind is not fixed on it; for then the object cannot be "the pen." I may not even see anything, if the impression is not taken by the mind also. And as long as the mind is fixed on the object, it is not conscious of even the class concept "pen." So, if acquaintance is what Russell wishes it to mean, then it is knowledge, though it may not be prop- ositional and communicable. But this knowledge is later developed into propositional form. For the sake of information, it may be mentioned that among Indian philosophers Rimdnuja thinks that indeterminate perception gives definite knowledge of definite individuals (vyaktis). And what he means by in- determinate perception is what Russell means by acquaintance. But Rdmd- nuja adds unnecessarily and wrongly that this kind of knowledge is pro- duced only when we perceive an object for the first time. When an Ameri- can boy sees an elephant for the first time, he has this knowledge. But when he sees it again or sees another elephant, he has determinate percep- tion. Rimdnuja's reason is this: When we see an object for the first time, the class concept could not have been prior; yet we see it as an object with a definite form. The form as a class concept could not have been detached from the object as yet. This is done later, when we see the same object again or when we see another object of the same class. But Rimanuja does not see that, even when we see the same object again, during the process of perception itself, the form or class concept is not detached from the object in order to turn the perception into the propositional form, "It is an ele- phant." It is of the form "the elephant." Psychologically, the detachment takes place only when the mind with the form detaches itself from the object before me. But so long as it is conscious of the form, mind is fixed on the particular object and so cannot have an abstract class concept before it. So we have to say that the propositional form is a later development by our consciousness for purposes of reasoning and communication. Then acquaint- ance becomes descriptive. Yet, acquaintance also is knowledge, as without it the propositional form could not have been developed. But, indeterminate perception is not knowledge, as I know nothing definite but am only aware that one of my senses is in contact with something.</page><page sequence="13">FEIGL ON INTUITION 161 Then, if mystic intuition is acquaintance, it can be knowledge. In Indian thought it also is wrongly called indeterminate knowledge. Riiminuja should have called it acquaintance, because God, the object of knowledge here, has personality and individuality. But for Sainkara it is indeterminate knowl- edge, as the Absolute for him has no determinateness. Yet it is knowledge, because consciousness is fully present, though mind is transformed and absorbed. In short, there is no separate individual there to reject the knowl- edge as unimportant, as in the case of indeterminate sense-perception. Both Sarhkara and Rdmdnuja are mystics. (2) Feigl challenges the view that the essence of reality can be known only by intuition and that reasoned discursive knowledge does not even penetrate into the heart of things.20 But a philosopher may retort by saying that the man who is born blind but who knows about colors through sounds does not penetrate into the reality of colors but has only symbolic knowledge. Like him, the mystic may say that his inward mystic experience may be symbolically explained through reasoning but cannot be experienced except directly.2" Bergson meant the same thing when he said that dura- tion is known or experienced only by living it, and this knowledge is intui- tion. Time spatialized as a straight line is only a symbolic representation. Even if it is symbolized algebraically, it is not knowledge of time that we get but an analysis. Of course, Bergson used many analogies to explain what he meant, and many arguments to show what time was not. But the main question is: Unless we have direct knowledge of time, how can we frame its symbolic representation? What is the symbolic representation about? Do we know what we are explaining. Or, are we constructing a conceptual fiction called time with the help of a graph or algebra? Is time real or only a conceptual fiction? (3) Corresponding to the distinction between intuition and intellect, Feigl points out a number of other distinctions given by Eddington, North- rop, Bergson, Russell, and Schlick. As Northrop is closely connected with this journal, I should say a little about his distinction. Are concepts by postulation merely descriptive in the sense of Russell's? Or, are they intui- tive also? Neither Plato's Ideas nor Aristotle's Forms are merely descrip- tive. For both, they are objects of rational intuition. Considering Kant's philosophy, one may say that the categories are hypothetical entities postu- lated for explaining experience. As hypothetical entities they may be called O?Feigl, op. cit., pp. 12 if.

RAJU conceptual constructions or epistemological fictions. Vaihinger would call them "as-ifs." But, first, Kant himself treats them as constitutive of experi- ence. And, second, the problem which the categories are postulated to solve is: How is physics possible? In fact, Kant took physics to be actual, not as a possible science. Or, to make the question less wide and more specific, it is: Why do I see the object in front of me as a substance with qualities when actually my senses see qualities only? Kan't answer is: Had our mind not used the category of substance-quality in constructing the object, it would not have seen the object as a substance with qualities. Kant does not construct the category substance-quality, but transfers it from the side of the object to that of mind. And what is constructed is the object. Then Kant's postulation is not conceptual construction, but assigning the category to mind. Then what is postulated need not always be a conceptual con- struction, but may be an intuition. Indeed, one may give a different interpretation of Kant or even say that Kant was wrong. But my point is that there is often intuition and then description of the intuited object even in Western thought. Even the mystic can have intuitive knowledge of something and then describe it. We gen- erally think that description is description of something with which we are acquainted. The so-called description of a constructed concept like that of multi-dimensional space is description by metaphor, which may better be called a proposal. But the object of mystic knowledge is not an object proposed. The mystic has a right to describe without being silent. If Rus- sell can hold that we can have knowledge by description without corres- ponding acquaintance-which is a deliberate product of thought, and he is right there-the mystic can at least have the right to describe, however imperfectly,22 that with which he is acquainted and also say that he has knowledge of what he describes. What Russell means by pure description without possible acquaintance is only mere conceptual construction, which is not really the description of anything except that of the concept con- structed. I wonder whether Kant's categories are such pure conceptual con- structions. If they are not, then the distinction between concepts by intui- tion and concepts by postulation cannot be clear-cut. I do not mean, of course, that there can be no concepts by mere postulation as we have in multi-valued logics and multi-dimensional geometries. We can have con- "Russell's theory of "incomplete symbols" and "logically inappropriate expressions" shows that he does not think that even definite description can be a complete substitute for knowledge by ac- quaintance. So, intuition, if we mean acquaintance by that word, is necessary for complete knowl- edge. And there is nothing strange in the fact that the mystic's description of his object is an incomplete and inappropriate expression. And neither we nor the mystic need be silent about what is known by acquaintance, as Feigl demands.</page><page sequence="15">FEIGL ON INTUITION 163 cepts by intuition also, such as that of color or man. We have no acquaint- ance in the former case; but in the latter we have acquaintance, and that also is knowledge. I have knowledge of man, not only when I have the concept of man, but also when I am looking at a man. (4) Feigl seems to suggest that, since the Kantian intuition of space and time, the intuitions of the axioms of Euclidian geometry, and instinctive knowledge23 are now explained otherwise, they are false. But do we not have those experiences? However it is explained, do we not see Euclidean space? Do we not have parental instincts now? Suppose space is explained symbolically in purely algebraic terms. Are the symbols the same as space or is the experience of those symbols the same as the experience of space? Similarly, in the case of mystic experience, let us for argument's sake agree that it can be explained in other terms. But these other terms do not con- stitute that experience. The greatest difficulty lies in the mystic's conten- tion that in his experience all distinctions between subject and object vanish: this is at least the contention of many. All say that it is beyond mind and reason. So, we cannot explain mystic experience in terms of Freud's Father- image. There is no image at all. The experience is sui generis and cannot be explained in other terms. Even supposing an explanation to be possible, it is no substitute for the original knowledge. To be able to explain a form of knowledge in terms of another form does not mean that the former is not real. To understand colors in terms of sounds does not mean that there are no colors. (5) Feigl's reference to the "nomological net" of naturalism suggests that he has an a priori set of rules and laws, and that he will accept as real whatever is caught by the net and reject whatever escapes. But this is a dogmatism which he introduces, while assailing religious dogmatism. No nomological net can be given to us ready-made and complete. This net in its completeness must be what Einstein calls "reason in Nature." This has to be constructed slowly and patiently, studying every form of reality with "natural piety." A net that can catch physical reality may not be able to catch other forms. What any particular science may safely regard as unim- portant and even as non-existent for its own affairs may have tremendous importance for the affairs of other studies and for man's life. If Kant was wrong in constructing an a priori net of categories on the basis of current logic, then the net of laws constructed by naturalism on the basis of external Nature may not suit inward reality and may suffer from similar inadequacy. The mystic philosopher may say this, and we have to keep an open mind even with regard to methods of study. 2 Feigl, op. cit., p. 3.</page></plain_text>
