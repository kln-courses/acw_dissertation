<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Concept of Primitive* By Catherine H. Berndt In this 10th anniversary year of the new series of Sociologus, it seems appropriate to look again at the term 'primitive', to consider briefly both its meanings and its implications. The relevance here is ♦ This paper was provoked by the ways in which a number of Anthro- pology students in the University of Western Australia used the term 'primitive*, in essays and in seminar discussions, and the reasons they gave for doing so. They held that because the term appeared so frequently in anthropological and other literature there could be no reasonable objec-</page><page sequence="2">The Concept of Primitive 51 two-fold. On the one hand the founder of this journal, Professor Richard Thurnwald, was firmly convinced that despite wide diver- gencies mankind was essentially one: that there was no inherent cleavage between peoples often called primitive, and those often called civilized. On the other hand Sociologus , following in this tradition, is centrally concerned with relations between peoples, and the problems arising from contact between different ways of living. The views which members of any given society hold about those who belong to others (and, conversely, about themselves) influence both the nature and the content of interaction between them. They represent a charter or guide to behaviour, which may or may not be modified by what takes place in the actual situation. Assumptions, or stereotypes about 'other people' are notoriously persistent even in the face of contrary evidence. They are part of an ideological framework within which 'facts' are examined, or a screen through which facts' are perceived. These frameworks or screens are inevitable up to a point in social affairs, when the peoples concerned may be evaluating one another in accordance with very different criteria. Nevertheless they con- stitute barriers both to communication and intercourse among them, and to relatively objective statements about them. There are thus two facets to this question. One is the theoretical issue, the place of the concept of primitive in generalizations about human society and culture, its usefulness in the ordering of data on a comparative basis. Efforts to classify or explain differences between peoples and ways of living have been going on for a long time, and have taken a number of forms. But perhaps the most persistent and most popular is the approach in which a category labelled primitive is separated out from another or others, with or without specifying criteria for doing so. The other issue is one of expediency. Objections to either the term or the concept, or both, may be such that they cannot lightly be disregarded. But merely changing the term may not satisfy either its protagonists or its opponents. In the first place, the contention may be that the label itself doesn't matter: that it merely points to a conceptual, objectively ascertainable reality, which exists tion to it ('Everybody say s iť), and certainly no need to define it ('We all know what it means'). Some of them treated it as a polar opposite to 'contemporary', which they restricted to Western European-type society: in other words, peoples called 'primitive' were, by definition, not 'con- temporary'. A few students inferred from this that generalizations relating to one type of people or society, that is, 'primitive', could have no relevance to the contrasting type, that is, 'contemporary' or 'Western'. There was some confusion as to where non-'tribal' Asian societies fitted into this scheme, and in fact when they were under consideration labels of this sort were often dropped. On the whole, however, the tendency was to make a clear-cut division between 'primitive' on the one hand, 'contem- porary' or 'Western' on the other. 4*</page><page sequence="3">52 Catherine H. Berndt independently of any name that may be applied to it. In the second place, this point of view itself may be challenged, as an attempt to distort the -facts' for political or other reasons. Since it is not possible to engage here in an exhaustive discussion on the subject, nor to do more than touch on the relevant literature, this paper will be confined to outlining a few of the points which should be borne in mind in regard to it. Meanings of the term 'Primitive9 (a) In a general sense, it suggests crudity, lack of development, roughness, inferior quality, (i) In some contexts it connotes inadequacy of means in relation to stipulated or inferred ends. This has special reference to the technological sphere, but is just as relevant to con- ditions within a society as it is in cross-cultural comparisons. For example, a digging stick is 'primitive' in contrast to a machine such as a tractor; a hand-worked pump, to a system of obtaining water through pipes and taps; a tent or shack, to a house; an open fire or a wood-stove to gas or electric appliances for cooking - and possibly the last two in turn will one day be called 'primitive' in contrast to devices which draw on solar heat, or atomic energy. And so on. 'Primitive' modes of transport are laborious, time-consuming or un- comfortable, as against those which are both speedier, and designed to afford passengers the minimum of inconvenience in reaching their destination. (ii) Sometimes it is taken to mean 'simple', or undifferentiated, as the polar opposite of 'complex'. Conversely it may mean 'complex', as the polar opposite of simplicity: that is, differentiated in respect of certain features which are negatively evaluated. Language is a notable example (Cf. R. R. Marrett, 1912/1923: 139-45; M. R. Cohen and E. Nagel, 1943/1949: 389; H. Good, 1958: 17-18): the loss of in- flections in English is sometimes seen as a move toward clarity (sim- plicity positively evaluated), as against retention of inflections in such languages as Latin and German. (b) In accordance with its etymology it may imply a point on a time scale, that is 'early' or 'first' or, more dramatically, 'primeval', 'primordial', 'pristine'. It has to do with the 'beginning' of things, the 4dawn' of human society. In the unilinear-evolutionary framework which is still fairly widely accepted, the same term embraces societies remote in time and accessible only through archaeological exploration, and present-day societies said to resemble them in a number of signi- ficant respects: for example, use of stone tools, and a hunting or slash-and-burn-agricultural economy. The latter are then taken as living respresentatives of 'early man', and therefore more or less</page><page sequence="4">The Concept of Primitive 53 straightforward examples of prehistoric culture and society (Cf. C. von Fürer-Haimendorf, in W. L. Thomas ed., 1955: 149 - 68). An offshoot of this view, not entirely abandoned even to-day, was the 'recapitula- tion theory': the suggestion that the development of human society through time paralleled the growth of individual human beings from childhood to physical and social maturity. There were references to the 'childhood of man', to the immaturity of prehistoric man and his living counterparts, and their naive, un-adult approach to reality1. In all such cases the term primitive suggests the persistence of certain features over long periods, with the minimum of change. In this sense it has a 'timeless' quality. People or societies so labelled are conceived as being, as it were, outside time. As physical organisms, it is conceded, such people are contemporary with ourselves: but this is an anomaly. They are in our time, but not of it: because, they belong to another world, the world of the past. It is not, however, accepted unquestioningly even by all of those who continue to use it. Its vagueness has led to difficulties at times in the realm of 'practicar, non-academic affairs. A topical example, in Australia, is a proposal put forward by the Common- wealth Government as part of the 1959 Federal Budget. The relevant section was reported in the local Press ( The West Australian , Perth August 12, 1959): "Under proposed legislation, Australian aborigines, unless they are nomadic or primitive, will be eligible to receive pensions and maternity allowances on the same basis as other people." The Western Australian Sitatie department responsible for handling the scheme, once it had been legally finalized, immediately raised the question of 'What does the word primitive really mean? How do we interpret it in actual situations?* They had some general idea of what was involved, but this was not enough to guide them in making decisions on individual cases. On the one hand it has been applied to semi-nomadic Aborigines with a minimum of out- side contact. On the other it has been used in a blanket way for all people of Aboriginal descent, ranging from those who speak little or no English to part-Aborigines who closely resemble the Australian-Europeans among whom they live: some of the latter too have been labelled 'primitive', though in this case the criteria are usually poor living conditions, careless- ness about hygiene, and so on. Persistence of the term Among the intangibles sometimes associated with 'civilization' are a broadening of conceptual horizons, an extension of the notion of 1 S. Langer (1942/1954: 121) speaks of arrested development at an 'adolescent* stage. See also A. L. Kroeber (1952: 224) for a parallel between 'primitive culture* and children's play. In a different setting, it has even been suggested that 'primitive' peoples in the process of becoming 'civilized* need to personalize authority before they can reach this goal, just as children in a 'civilized' society must do if they are to achieve social maturity: G. Freyre (1959: 50).</page><page sequence="5">54 Catherine H. Berndt humanity to include peoples outside one's own social environment, and tolerance or appreciation of other ways of living. A contrast is drawn between this and the closed society of the noncivilized world, with its arrogant rejection of 'foreigners' and 'foreign' customs, its jealously ethnocentric definition of humanity, its indifference to any moral claims except those of its own members. This distinction, however, is more of an ideal than a reality. The unit of membership in to-day's world is wider than it was, and so is the acknowledgement of humanity: but it is sometimes a grudging acknowledgement (cf. R. Bemdt, 1959: 60 - 77). Although ethnocentrism in some degree is a feature of most societies, as part of the process by which social boundaries are maintained, the dominance of Western European na- tions in world affairs meant, also, the dominance of their particular varieties of ethnocentrism. The gulf between their living standards and values and those of the nonr-literate people they encountered on other continents was perceived by most of them as far-reaching and almost unbridgeable - far more so than the differences between themselves and the settled peoples of Asia (India, China and Japan for instance), with their textiles and other material equipment for living, and their tradition of literacy at least among the élite. The discovery of the non-literate world may have reinforced the belief in an essential opposition between civilized city-dwellers and the nomads who threatened them from without, a belief deriving perhaps from man's early history in the Middle East and kept alive by the popular conception of the Tall of Rome'. Much of what has been written about the people and societies of the non-literate world is not easily explained except in terms of some such framework of assumptions. In the early days of contact with them, a certain insensitivity in such matters was only to be expected. Anthropology and empirical Sociology were barely developing. In spite of the wealth of literature dealing with Europe and its traditions, the people of that continent (as of others at that time) were not accus- tomed to a systematic, relatively objective scrutiny of their insti- tutions and values. At the risk of oversimplifying, one might say that the position of Europe in the 19th Century, not seriously or consistently challenged by the rest of the world, may well have supported the view that only the 'lower' races, like the 'lower' classes, were a proper subject for this kind of scrutiny. In reading some of the accounts of that period relating to non-literate peoples, one cannot help being impressed by their lack of 'self awareness' in social-cultural terms. Herodotus-type reporting was still very much in vogue. Partly because of the very nature of their subject matter, the social sciences were slower in systematizing their methods and their handling of data than the natural and physical sciences; and the evolutionary</page><page sequence="6">The Concept of Primitive 55 framework built up after the Darwinian model, although later qual- ified to some extent, seems to have had in some quarters almost a petrifying effect. Increasing sophistication in methodology and techniques, in the reporting and analysis of social and cultural events, have led anthro- pologists to be more cautious in accepting at face value the 'facts* reported by early ethnographers, missionaries and travellers. The assumptions underlying their reporting in the first place, and in the se- cond place the use made of their statements by others, have (not always been treated so critically. Many of them affirmed their belief that all contemporary peoples, however odd some of them might seem, shared a common humanity; but this was counterbalanced by the suggestion of an equally fundamental cleavage, between 'civilized' and 'nom-civilized' man. The linkage here, where one was admitted, was often claimed to be so tenuous as to be almost negligible for most practical purposes. As reporting became less obviously subjective, similarities assumed increasing importance. The framework within which they were perceived, however, has remained very much as before. One difficulty in social reasearch is that 'hunch' statements often take much the same form as generalizations which have undergone a certain amount of empirical testing, and on the face of it the two are not always easy to distinguish. Deductive systems built up with the help of a few 'facts' may appear very much like carefully considered accounts of actual phenomena. Synthesizing statements designed to 'map out' areas on which information is scanty are undeniably useful, as part of the two-way relationship involved, in theory-building, bet- ween empirical 'facts' and idea-systems. The danger lies in treating them as more than tentative formulations, as statements of actuality rather than as hypotheses for testing2. The 'halo' associated with some writers tends to perpetuate them as authoritative statements, espe- cially but not only among persons within their particular fields of interest. The words of Marrett and of Tylor, in the same or a slightly different form, have been repeated over the years in a variety of contexts as reliable empirical generalizations: . . in primitive society - in a general way of speaking, no one dreams of breaking the social rules"; "Custom is king, nay tyrant, in primitive society" (K. R. Marrett, 1912/1923: 182-3); "life in the uncivilized 2 One example, among many, is Talcott Parsons' account of the "Kinship System of the Contemporary U.S." ( Talcott Parsons , 1949/1954: 177-96). In Ispitfe of the author's qualifying remarks, this is often treated as a firmly grounded empirical account of that subject. In regard to this general point, especially where earlier writers Were concerned, see Furfey's remarks on "the fallacy of speculation plus illustration" (P. H. Furfey, 1953: 174).</page><page sequence="7">56 Catherine H. Berndt world is fettered at every turn by chains of custom*' (E. B. Tylor, 1930: 137); "one might almost say that the savage sees himself so consistently through the eyes of the rest that he thinks of himself as 'sonand-so' rather than as T ... Self-consciousness, in the sense of self-criticism based on an analysis of motive, is quite beyond his reach3." The evolutionary scheme which classified people in such terms as 'savage' and 'barbarian' has had, indirectly, a far-reaching impact. Among present-day anthropologists the word 'savage' is no longer in vogue, although Malinowski used it as one substitute for 'primitive'. Its appeal, however, has not been confined to the 'popular' field. It appears as a descriptive label in a wide range of settings4. Stereotypes of this sort seem to remain unaffected by the accumu- lation of data: or rather, such data are used selectively within the preferred conceptual setting. In extreme instances they are drawn upon to build up a self-supporting or self-perpetuating system, as in a recent study by Kelsen5. The earlier generalized assertions have a well-merited place in the history of anthropological methodology and theory, as provisional syntheses which served to order such material as was available, and so contributed to the refinement of conceptual frameworks and techniques. Their influence, however, has been more extensive and more pervasive than this. To take the case of a writer who made considerable use of ethnographic material, the interpre- tations of Lévy-Bruhl have had a tremendous influence on both academic and popular views about 'primitive thought*. Because his earlier works on this subject have been available for some time in English translations6, as his later reformulations are not, these 'second 3 R. R. Marrett (1927/1928: 77); see also p. 8, for a summing up^ of 'savagery' as a state of 'Intellectual confusion combined with physical discomfort'. 4 S. Langer (1942/1954: passim - see index references, but especially pp. 83~-4); J. Huizinga (1950/1955: e.g. 25); J. Dewey (1922/1950 and 1955/ 1956): e.g. 9-10; J. Piaget (1955: 26 - 7, in reference to "the language of savages, imbeciles and young children"; H. and H. A. Frankfort et al. (1949/1951: e.g. 12). 5 H. Kelsen (1946: e.g. 24): "The savage cannot pronect his ego upon the external world becausei he has not yet discovered his ego". To support hiis thesis, on the development of the 'idea of causality', he draws most heavily on earlier secondary accounts, of the type already mentioned. Cf. footnote 21 on p. 271, where the reference is to D. Brinton (1897: 68), as saying of 'the savage': "His language has no word meaning 'to die', but only 'to be killed'." 6 See e. g., L. Lévy-Bruhl (1926), (1923). For an example of the author s bias in favour of a special category of 'primitive thought', clouding his own assessment of what it involved, it is interesting to contrast two statements in this last volume: on the one hand the missionary's complaint (quoted on p. 23) that some South Africans refused to believe in God unless they could actually see him (they "only believe what they see"), on the other the author's comment on 'primitives' (p. 31): "We cannot rid their minds of the belief that an infinite number of invisible beings and actions are actually real. Livingstone tells us that he often found wonder in the</page><page sequence="8">The Concept of Primitive 57 thoughts' seem to be less widely known7. In them he rejected the term 'prelogicar, and acknowledged that there were common qualities inherent in all human thinking: for instance that the 'law of partici- pation' was not confined to the 'primitive' world. Nevertheless he continued to employ the dual characterization of 'primitive' as con- trasted with 'ourselves', and inferred that only 'primitive' man was a predominantly social being, unable to separate himself as a distinct, individual person from his social and natural environment (Lévy- Bruhl, 1949: e. g. 247, 250-1). Even studies designed to challenge or to controvert allegations of difference in kind between 'primitive' and 'civilized' mentality have tended to use the same schema of classification. Boas called his volume on this topic The Mind of Primitive Man (1938). Driberg gave his the title of The Savage as he Really is (1929: cf. his reference on p. 2n. to the categories 'primitive' and 'savage'), evidently taking it for granted that there were human beings who could legitimately be categorized in this way. We no longer speak of the 'ruder' peoples, as some earlier writers did, perhaps because the word has a different connotation in present-day English usage. Nor do we speak so readily of 'lower' or 'inferior' peoples, although 'Stone Age' remains a popular label. The assumptions which underlie this kind of distinction, howe- ver, in other words the emotional as against the rational 'reasons' for retaining it, are still with us. Person, or Environment? A distinction occasionally drawn here has a partial parallel in the 'nature-nurture', 'heredity-versus-environmenť controversy. It is suggested in the contrast between such titles as 'The Religion of the Primitives' or 'The Mind of the Primitive' and 'Primitive Religion', 'Primitive Mentality' or 'The Primitive Mind'. The first two point to the social dimension, inferring that there are specific persons or so- cieties which can be so labelled. The others might be expected to focus on the cultural dimension, dealing with certain ways of thinking or behaving but not necessarily relating them to any specific social units. (a) Primitive Man has become almost a mythical figure in the lite- rature of most European languages, and not just in that part of it conventionally labelled 'anthropological'. He is a convenient peg on which to hang a variety of views: but this is variety only within a rather narrow range. At one extreme, in his 'uncontaminated' state incontrovertible faith of the negroes of South Africa in beings whom they had never seen." 7 L. L évy-Bruhl (1949). He had already suggested earlier that 'pre-lagical' thinking was not confined to 'primitives': see e.g. Lévy -Brühl (1931: 26).</page><page sequence="9">58 Catherine H. Berndt he is seen as a noble character8, exemplifying all or most of the virtues which less fortunate human beings have lost or been deprived of: in a word, Adam, before his 'fair and expulsion from the Garden of Eden. More often he is shown in a less favourable light. In this guise he often appears as a 'marginal man' in the most fundamental sense, human only by definition or extension of definition. His intelli- gence or 'mental ability' is limited, if not 'childish'. His world is not only restricted, but framed almost wholly in anthropomorphic terms. He is unable to differentiate between personal and non-personal, animate and inanimate, living and dead. He is incurious, content to accept without question the traditions handed on to him from the past, bound by custom, mystical, non-rational, uncritical, given to confused symbolizing, improvident, dirty, irresponsible, swayed by emotion and habit, incapable of discursive reasoning, and incapable too of achieving more than a limited development in his moral stand- ards. The picture, even without further elaboration, is a depressing one. Anthropologists to-day, on the whole, handle this label of 'primitive man' more warily than they did a few years ago. Extravagant characterizations persist; but they are mainly in other fields, especially those in which there is a preference for the sweeping but confident impressions of the past rather than for the more sober accounts which are increasingly demanded within the profession. (b) ' Primitive Culture9: Even writers concerned with 'the mind of primitive man', or 'the primitive mind', mostly took the cultural setting into account as either a limiting or a determining factor. At the present time, however, it is generally accepted that there are no innate differences in 'mental ability' or in 'intelligence' on the basis of race: or, rather, that no such differences have been satisfactorily established. What is more, this issue is not a popular one in many parts of the world. To raise it there is to question the creed that, in this respect at least, all but the physically brain-damaged are poten- tially equal: that hereditary handicaps, where such exist, do not take this form. The cross-cultural validity of tests designed to measure 'intelligence' has been repeatedly challenged. At the same time the political implications of ranking or grading different peoples in these terms, and the possibility of manipulation to suit politically framed ends, have become more obtrusive, and more a matter of internatio- nal concern. This means that 'primitiveness' is no longer regarded as an indi- vidual or personal attribute in quite the same way or to the same 8 For a recent example, where the word primitive is used as a term of respect", see V. Elwin (1959: 15).</page><page sequence="10">The Concept of Primitive 59 extent that it was. There is rather more emphasis on the flexibility and malleability of human material, rather less on rigidity and inherent inequalities. This is in line with the view adopted by a number of writers, in the last century as well as in this, that there is no such thing as 'primitive man' or a 'primitive mind', merely man living in a 'primitive' culture or society. Responsibility for lack of 'progress' is then attributed to absence of opportunity rather than to innate incapacity. Isolation, for instance, equivalent to lack of cross- fertilization of ideas, infrequent contact with other peoples who might have stimulated changes in various fields of living, has been seen as a major factor here. The 'primitive isolate' (see e. g. R. Redfield, 1956: Chapter I) is contrasted with 'folk' or 'peasant' or urban societies. The current trend is to speak less in terms of 'primitive man' as such, and more in terms of the society or culture, or religion, or art which is said to be associated with him. The major problems involved, how- ever, have not been allowed to lapse. They have merely been for- mulated in slightly different ways. Assessment of 'Différences* In the study of social affairs, much use has been made of conceptual divisions as a means of understanding or explaining uniformity and diversity, conservatism and change. Usually they are framed in terms of two basic types, occasionally three: Gemeinschaft-Gesellschaft, or 'Community- Association'; folk-urban, rural-urban, or folk-peasant- urban; mechanical solidarity-organic solidarity; sacred-secular; society of status-society of contract; traditional - value rational - purposive rational; tradition-directed - inner-directed - other-directed. All these have some features in common, approaching the same broad set of problems from varying angles. Two methodological points are relevant in connection with all of them. Firstly, there is the question of whether they are heuristic de- vices for exploring the empirical situation, or descriptive labels which correspond to certain aspects of that situation. Secondly, there is the question of what is involved in each case: a dichotomy or a continuum. Although opinions differ, in practical as well as in ideal terms the weighting does seem to be in favour of treating them as logical or fictional constructs, 'ideal types' which abstract from the real situation in order to explore significant relations within it, but have no exact counterparts there. Recently there have been attempts to reconcile the two approaches and show that they are not mutually exclusive. Freeman and Winch (1957: 461 - 66). for instance, holding that such 'polar ideal types' are all concerned with the same 'unidimensional pheno- menon - societal complexity', selected as indicators of this eight characte- ristics, framed as 'paired opposites'. Because six of them could readily</page><page sequence="11">60 Catherine H. Berndt be arranged on a Guttman-type scale, they concluded that such con- structs were empirically as well as heuristically applicable to social phenom- ena. (The remaining two characteristics they found to be unscalable. This is not surprising: one, concerned with exogamy, was phrased in terms of 'range of incest tabus'; the other, concerned with criteria of mate selection, contrasted 'beauty', alone, with 'beauty' plus consideration of fertility and working ability.) In another example9 twenty 'cultures'10 listed in the Human Relations Area Files were taken, and scaled for "developmental ratings" in terms of 'primitivism' and 'modernity'. The last two terms were used in a more or less arbitrary way, reinforced by the fact that eight of the cultures had been categorized by the Human Relations Area Files as 'primitive', the other twelve as 'more advanced'. Of the 72 categories which the authors tried to scale in these terms, only 16 responded satisfactorily: among those excluded as non-scalable were social stratification and communication, two featoires sometimes regarded as critical in discussions of this sort. Moreover, the authors point out (Rose and Willoughby, 1958: 481) that had they chosen a different source for their information on Indonesia, "a completely different cultural profile would obtain" for that country. One of their concluding comments is of direct interest to us here, in connection with the meanings attached to the term 'primitive': noting Freeman and Winch's concern with 'increasing complexity' they observe that they them- selves, on the contrary, "were impressed by a narrow range of emphases among modern cultures that could well be regarded as a sort of simplicity". There have been other endeavours, over the years, to find valid indexes for comparing and scaling human societies. Some, like these two, have employed statistical techniques. Others have proceded more impressionistically, and others again have drawn on a wealth of more or less systematic empirical data. The basic criteria vary. Pater Schmidt's criterion of the presence or absence of a 'high god' is well known. So are the evolutionary stages centering on means of sub- sistence: the criterion of industrialization, or use of machines, comes under the same broad heading. As has often been said, techniques and material equipment are perhaps the easiest of all cultural features to assess on a unilinear scale11. Another kind of demarcation was 9 E. Rose and G. Willoughby (1958: 476 - 90). Another recent effort to investigate 'levels of development', in this case in an evolutionary frame- work, is afforded by R. Naroll (1956: 687 - 715). 10 Cf. discussion of 'units of comparison' by I. Schapera (1953: 353 - 62). In Rose and Willoughby's study (1958), the 'cultures' treated for their purpose as single units included such disparate entities as the Soviet Union, China. India, Copper Eskimo, northern Paiute, and Tasmania. 11 For a recent comment see J. Cazeneuve (1959: 102 - 24). He suggests that in purely technical matters two stages of human development can be delineated, the first comprising those peoples "whose technical method is oriented toward direct acquisition and simple manufacture". Less specif- ically, he speaks of "societies which stagnate in archaism and those which open up to history". See also R. Firth , in E. Evans-Pritchard et al. (1956: 15 - 16); S. F. Nadel (1956: e.g. 170).</page><page sequence="12">The Concept of Primitive 61 suggested by Kroeber (1952: 317 - 9)12, who took as one criterion a social or ritual forcus on physiological aspects, as against a diminishing social concern with them in 'civilized' societies. It is perhaps useful to have a shorthand label which summarizes a number of features ¡not easily compressed under some more specific heading: smallness in scale; relative self-sufficiency; simple techno- logy; stress on kinship, and on interpersonal relations; absence of a money economy - and so on. But this usefulness is far outweighed by its disadvantages, particularly in regard to applying it in actual situations. Conceptualizing the human world into two broad categories, how- ever subdivided, is widespread in space and time, ranging from moiety systems to more fluid or ambitious formulations. Where the line of cleavage is taken as a shifting one, with societies or cultures classified in different ways for different purposes, or where a series of such lines is suggested, there is less likely to be a hardening of divisions between them and less danger of assumptions about essential or ge- neric differences. To insist on a 'difference in kind' (cf. F. S. C. Northrop, 1956: 1053) between one type of society and another, as a fundamental and far-reaching distinction which extends into all areas of living, is to speak in normative terms, to underestimate similarities for the sake of highlighting differences. It carries to an extreme the distinction often drawn (e. g. S. Tax, 1950; J. H. Rowe, 1950) between scientific and non-scientific (or 'pre-scientific') thinking. A number of writers have warned against making too much of the assumed cleavage (e.g. F. Kaufmann, 1944: 33; A. Macbeth, 1952: 261; R. Mer- ton, 1949/1957: 560), pointing out for instance that such a distinction is relevant within Western industrialized societies, and not just be- tween them and others. There is a tendency to play down this point, by asserting that the existence of 'non-rational' features in Western-type societies has been adequately documented, and that this is already acknowledged as a matter of degree rather than of mutually exclusive alternatives. Such differences in degree are, however, often held to be so massive as to override similarities for comparative purposes. Nevertheless the ma- terial dealt with by psychiatrists and psychoanalysts, for instance, and the field of religious belief as such (i. e. apart from considerations of complexity, or the logical structuring of that belief) indicate plainly enough that 'rational', 'scientific' thinking remains largely an ideal, more relevant to certain categories of persons (e. g. 'scientists') and of culture (e. g. technology) than others. High-pressure advertising, most notably in North America, can draw on a wide range of technical and 12 Also D. Riesman (1954: 301 - 2)š</page><page sequence="13">62 Catherine H. Berndt social scientific developments; but in this sphere, the consideration of how to 'catch' and 'hold' customers, one finds statements strikingly similar to those so often made about 'primitive' man. We are told that most people ordinarily tend to think in 'concrete' rather than 'ab- stract' terms (cf. D. B. Lucas and S. H. Britt, 1950: 123) and are of only 'average intelligence'; that 'the average person' can take in only four or five points at a time (ibid., 42); that the simplest and most direct appeals are the most likely to succeed (W. Albig, 1956: 81); that the language used must be fairly elementary if it is to be understood by the majority of readers (Lucas and Britt, 1950: 50 - 1, 426); that verbal language alone is less easily understood and remembered than pictures or objects (cf. J. Ruesch and W. Kees, 1956: 30, 102, 191; also L. Doob, 1948/1949: e.g. 445 - 7); that potential customers cannot be reached by persuasion through "logic and argument", but only through such means as constant repetition (M. Mayer, 1958: 43 - 4, 57), and the arousing of an emotional response. Fluctuation between two extremes is exemplified too in the current dichotomy of ^East' versus 'West', which in this sense points less to spatial than to cultural or political or ideological positioning. Kipling's portentous assertion that the two could 'never meet' is still echoed in some quarters to-day, more especially perhaps in sections of the mass media. Against it is the stand that cultural and other differences are entirely irrelevant, that 'human nature is the same everywhere' re- gardless of superficial divergences. This duality, wavering between 'mystical incomprehensibility' and almost intuitive understanding, is directly comparable to the kind of attitudes often expressed in regard to 'primitive man'. Conclusion On the one hand, then, there is growing recognition of the similar- ities and common features which can be found among all human beings, and all human societies. In one context this takes the form of acknowledging that the racial differences between them are of a minor sort, seen against the long period of man's evolution13. On the other hand, there are perhaps equally strong and more obtrusive claims of essential dissimilarities. In the genetic sphere, an extreme but deviant position was taken at least until quite recently by Ruggles Gates, who postulated differential development for the principal races of mankind (which he labels 'species'). In the social and cultural sphere, it is illustrated in statements to the effect that 'primitive' societies are so clearly unlike modern 'civilized' societies that the study of the one can have no bearing on the other. Proponents of this view are in some respects following in the intellectual footsteps of earlier writers, who based their arguments on impressions rather than on</page><page sequence="14">The Concept of Primitive 63 sustained empirical analysis. But even these earlier writers were not as consistently dogmatic as they often appear to be. Marrett (1912/1923: 206), for instance, observed cautiously: "I think that we may easily exaggerate the differences in culture and, more especially, in religious insight and understanding that exist between the ruder peoples and ourselves". He went so far as to suggest that contact between peoples with different ways of living could lead to the 'widening of horizons' often associated with 'civilization', in a much broader sense than is sometimes understood by this phrase. In other words, he envisaged it in relation not just to the non-literate peoples coming into contact with the Western world, but to that Western world itself. Although he prefaced his statement with the qualifications in- evitable in his day and age, he nevertheless hoped that: "with fuller experience of the rich content of human intelligence, we shall become more tolerant of diversity, more inclined to widen our own tastes, as in matters of fine art, than to curtail those of our neigh-bours" (Marrett, 192771928: 10). Tolerance of diversity is of course, like conformity, a relative matter, varying in accordance with the type of behaviour or subject matter involved and its social and political context. It is perhaps significant that Marrett selected the case of 'fine art' to illustrate his point, since this is often taken as a sphere remote from controversial issues in the political sense. This is not the place to discuss the question, which is relevant here only in relation to the contention that use of the term 'primitive', as an heuristic tool or a descriptive label, encourages in- tolerance of diversity by taking certain differences as 'given' but con- cealing the premises on which the assumption is based. Despite the confusion attaching to it, some writers despair of any prospect of abolishing it. After pointing to its vagueness, its emotional aura, or the distortion of reality which it encourages with its conno- tation of crudeness and distance in time, they conclude that it is nevertheless too deeply ingrained in European thinking to be dislodged (cf. M. Herskovits, 1940/1952: v- vi, 25 - 8; R. B. Inver arity in W. L. Thomas ed., 1955: 376 - 77), or that there are no convenient labels to take its place (Macbeath, 1952: vi). Even Lévy-Bruhl (1923: 13) was not wholly in favour of it; and Tylor (1930: Vol. 1, 25) suggested that it should not be applied to the stone-age hunters whose remains were found at Abbeville or Torquay, because "this might be understood to mean that they were the first men who appeared on earth, or at least like them". Substitutes which have been tried are all open to criticism on one ground or another. Some point openly to differences in time. 'Stone- Age' man is a device for exciting popular interest, and like talking of</page><page sequence="15">64 Catherine H. Berndt 'archaic'13 or 'old' societies or cultures is misleading where contempo- rary peoples are concerned. Preliterate, pre-agricultural, pre-industrial, imply staging on a fixed evolutionary scale. 'Exotic', which has be- come quite popular lately, is reminiscent of the kind of appeal made by travel agencies. Terms like backward, naive, retarded, unsophisti- cated, stunted, or vegetative, even 'Nature-folk', have a pejorative ring. Speaking of 'arrested development' or even of undeveloped or underdeveloped societies infere much the same tone of superiority, even though the last two are often specifically applied to countries or means of production rather than to social or cultural phenomena. With 'agrarian' societies we enter a more clearly neutral realm of dis- cussion, but with the danger of slipping into the easy scheme of la- belling peoples simply in accordance with such economic categories as 'hunters', 'food-collectors' and so on. Although 'non-literate' (M. Hers- kovits, 1948: 74 - 5) has obvious shortcomings, it does draw attention to the most important single criterion of difference as between one human culture and another, and one underlying the further demarca- tion hinging on the development of the machine. It has the advantage of being a neutral term, which at the same time indicates in a straightforward way what criterion is being employed. 'Primitive' has been employed as a contrast or a polar opposite to 'Western', or 'civilized', or 'advanced'14, or 'historical', or 'prosperous', or 'modern' or even 'contemporary'15. Despite attempts to tighten up its application by the use of more systematic techniques than were available in the past, it carries an emotional aura of disparagement or negative evaluation which cannot so readily be eliminated. The plea which Dozier (1955: 187-202) has made for relinquishing it in favour of less 'loaded' terms is both cogent and timely. The reasons he gives are two-fold. There is the ethical question of applying it to peoples who may regard it as degrading and offensive. Equally im- 13 Cf. M. Eliade (1954: passim). He also uses the terms 'premodern', 'traditional', and 'primitive'; under the latter heading he evidently includes Japan, which he refers to (p. 70) as having "an eccentric culture". See also K. E. Boulding (1956: 126&gt; 49). 14 For a fictional society which superficially appears to be primitive but] is actually 'advanced', see Chad Oliver (1955: "Rite of Passage"): in this case technological achievements are concealed, but nonetheless present. 15 Although both 'modern' and 'contemporary' are of course relative terms, it is interesting to notice the change in meaning which is associated with them in some contexts. Contemporary 'means' existing at the same time, and modern is sometimes taken as a little ahead of this, in the sense of 'new* or 'up-to-the-minute'. But in regard to the construction and sale of houses, at least in Australia, their meanings are reversed 'Modern' popularly to a house which is not quite up-to-date. In effect, it points to the past. 'Contemporary' refers to a house design which is, if anything, in advance of current trends (often impressionistically assessed). It points, that is, to the future.</page><page sequence="16">The Concept of Primitive 65 portant are the practical problems stemming from their reaction: on the one hand the political connotations in the present state of world affairs; on the other, on a smaller scale, their objections to being studied by members of a discipline, Anthropology, which is popularly associated with the study of 'primitives' - often equated with 'subject peoples', under 'colonial* domination16. It is true that some persons who continue to use the word primitive do so in a relatively neutral way, with no evidence of emotional pre- judice. But this does not mitigate its impact on peoples who are aware of its evaluative bias, especially in popular or sensational interpreta- tions. With the spread of literacy and the increase in political aware- ness on an international basis, people so designated are coming to realize something of what it involves, and to incorporate this new knowledge into their own assessment of other societies and cultures. The labels which people apply to one another acquire 'meaning' in the course of being used: their 'flavour' comes from the contexts with which they are associated. Even the word native, which in a general sense has no derogatory meaning, has come to be linked in some regions (India, for instance) with 'colonial' rule, and to be rejected as a sign of unfavourable discrimination. Such changes in meaning are part of a familiar and universal process; but in the sensitive area of international relations, with dealings between peoples in a more public and also a more large-scale affair than they used to be, it is as well to remember that the need for objectivity ini social research is a matter of practical and not just of theoretical concern. A third point, noted at the beginning of this paper, is worthy of attention too. Social scientists, including anthropologists, are concerned with the development of a body of theory relating to social and cultural phenomena generally, and not in a merely local or regional sense. The suggestion of crucial differences distinguishing one 'kind' of society or one 'kind' of people from another17 has a direct bearing on this matter, limiting the range within which generalizations can be applied or tested, inferring that there are no pan-human phenomena appropriate to such study. Man is an evaluating animal, given to ordering his preferences on unilinear rather than on multilinear scales: but there is the danger that highlighting dramatic differences, by means of blanket-categories (or 'weasel-words') such as 'primitive', will obscure equally important similarities. 16 See G. J. Held (1953: 25). 17 This is what Bierstedt implies: R. Bierstedt (1948: 22--30), and the attached 'Comment' by C. Kluckhohn. See also R. Redfield (1953: e.g., Chapter VI, "The Transformation of Ethical Judgement"). 5 Socilogus 10, 1.</page><page sequence="17">66 Catherine H. Berndt Two partly contradictory trends have gathered momentum in the past decade or so. On the one hand there is the tremendous increase in technological achievements, accompanied by growing emphasis on the natural and physical sciences. The current respect for develop- ments in this sphere (earth satellites, for instance), and desire to sur- pass them, is widening the conceptual distance between nations capable of participating in this race and non-literate or non-industrialized peoples with poor material equipment and inadequate financial re- sources. The gap between specialists and non-specialists within such nations is frequently deplored: but it is even more marked between them and others. On the other hand, the post-war period has seen the intensification of demands for 'freedom', 'equality of opportun- ities', 'the rights of man' and so on. Among the foremost in this field have been non-European peoples, including some (for example in Africa) still occasionally labelled 'primitive'. Pressures toward diffe- rentiation among peoples on the basis of technological skills, then, are meeting other pressures rejecting such differentiation on the grounds of fundamental human equality. The clash is, so far, more incipient than actual, but it is likely to have farreaching effects which cannot be confined to the sphere of technology.

Synopsis Der Begriff „primitiv" Die Differenzierung anthropologischer und sozialwissenschaftlicher Kennt- nisse und Theorien hat zwar eine ständig steigende Vorsicht bei Ver- wfendung des Begriffes „primitiv" ergeben, ihn aber bisher nicht völlig eliminiert. Die Tendenz der jüngsten Zeit ging dahin, ihn für individuums- und rassenbezogene Forschungen fallen zu lassen, nicht jedoch, für das sozio-kulturelle Gebiet, jedenfalls nicht konsequent. In diesem Zusammen- hang stellen sich zwei Fragen: 1. ist der Begriff bzw. etwaige Substitute essentiell berechtigt? 2. ist im Hinblick auf die ihm durch traditionelle Assoziationen innewohnenden Wertakzente seine Beibehaltung tunlich, z. B. bezüglich der internationalen Beziehungen oder auch der möglichen Aus- wirkungen auf Forschungstätigkeit in damit apostrophierten Kulturen? Zum ersten Punkt ist zu sagen, daß alle behaupteten Wesensunterschiede primitiver Zustände zu einem angenommenen Gegenteil zu forciert bzw. zu einseitig-beschränkt erscheinen. Auch die Herausstellung einer relativen Primitivität hatte bisher stets nur für bestimmte Sektoren von! Kulturen Gültigkeit, nicht dagegen für einen totalen derartigen Zusammenhang. Rein pragmatisch gesehen schränken außerdem solche grundsätzlichen Dichotomien den Gültigkeitsbereich von Aussagen bei der Untersuchung allgemeiner kultureller Probleme von vornherein ein. Eis scheint also keine wissenschaftliche Notwendigkeit zur Beibehaltung von durch „primitiv" oder synonyme Termini gekennzeichneten Einteilungs-</page><page sequence="20">Sprachkritische Aspekte zur Hamitentheorie über Hottentottenherkunft 69 prihzipien zu bestehen.
