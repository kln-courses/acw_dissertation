Morgan, October 13, 1909; Received November 3, 1909. Professor John Burnet says :2 " So far as I know, no historian of Greek philosophy has clearly laid it down that the word used by the early cosmologists to express this idea of a permanent and primary sub stance was none other than &lt;?wis ;3 and that the title ILepl &lt;$&gt;vo-em, so commonly given to philosophical wTorks of the sixth and fifth centuries B. c.,4 means simply Concerning the Primary Substance. Both Plato and Aristotle use the term in this sense when they are discussing the 1 This paper was begun in the spring of 1908, and was read in substance before the Classical Club of Princeton University, Dec. 17, 1908. 2 Early Greek Philosophy, 2d ed., 1908, p. 12 foil. 3 Burnet, ibid., p. 13 foil., p. 57, n. 1, rejects the traditional view that Anaxi mander so used ?pxh, which, he says, "is in this sense purely Aristotelian." This statement, and the other that "To Anaximander ?pxv could only have meant begin ning,'" are open to question ; cp.

Burnet also says (p. 56) "That Anaximander called this something [i.e. his "Aweipop] by the name of (pvais, is clear from the doxographers." This statement likewise may fairly be challenged. 4 Burnet here adds in a note : "I do not mean to imply that the philosophers used this title themselves ; for early prose writings had no titles. The writer men tioned his name and the subject of his work in the first sentence, as Herodotus, for instance, does."

In Greek philosophical language, &lt;?wris always means that which is primary, fundamental, and persistent, as opposed to what is secondary, derivative, and transient ; what is 'given/ as opposed to that which is made or becomes. It is what is there to begin with." "There is one important conclusion," says Professor Burnet,6 "that follows at once from the account just given of the meaning of 4&gt;v&lt;n&lt;;, and it is, that the search for the primary substance really was the thing that interested the Ionian philosophers. Had their main object been, as Teichm?ller held it was, the explanation of celestial and meteorolog ical phenomena, their researches would not have been called7 Ilept &lt;?vo-eco? IcrTopLYj, but rather Ilepl ovpavov or ILepl /xeTewpwv." Considering its source, this declaration is of sufficient importance to justify an extended examination for its own sake, especially as it has not been adequately met by students of Greek thought ;8 but the pur pose of this study is somewhat different. The words quoted from Pro fessor Burnet serve, therefore, chiefly as a point of departure. It is proposed to consider three subjects, which are of importance in relation to the works entitled Ilept ^o-cw? : .(1) the historical relation of the studies so entitled to mythology and poetry ; (2) the senses in which &lt;t&gt;vcris was employed before 400 b. c. ; (3) the probable connotation of the title liepl &lt;?uo-eot)?, judging by the direction of interest of the writers as indicated by the problems they raised. Before proceeding to the consideration of these questions, however, it may be proper to touch briefly on several subjects suggested by the 5 Burnet here refers to Arist.

Though this use of y?peais is as old as Homer (? 201, 246), and though Plato could employ it in allusion to Homer (Theaet. 180 D), it would be ill chosen to explain &lt;pvats. Ast in his ed.

Burnet might have referred with more propriety to Plato, Legg. 891 C, but it is to be noted that 0rf&lt;ns is singular. 6 Ibid. p. 14. 7 Burnet here refers to Plato, Phaedo 96 A and Eurip., fr. 910. We may add Theophrastus, Ph. 0. fr. 5 (Diels, Dox. 480, 7) and fr. 9 {ibid. 485, 1). In the latter case i] it.

It is probably true that early prose writings had no formal titles ; but our information on this point is really too scanty to admit of dogmatic statement.9 It is reasonably certain that philosophical works were- familiarly quoted as bearing the title Tlepl &lt;f&gt;v&lt;re(?s some time before the close of the fifth century, as we may see from the works of Hippocrates ;10 and from the time of Xeno phon, Plato, and Aristotle u onwards it must have been the accepted designation. In regard to the scope of the title Ilept &lt;?vo-ew? and Pro fessor Burnet's attempt to limit it narrowly to the meaning Concerning the Primary Substance, and to distinguish it, as if coordinate, from such titles as Ilept ovpavov and TLepl ?xere^paw, we shall be in better posi tion to decide at the conclusion of our inquiry. But, while it is clearly impossible, without writing a history of Greek philosophy, to refute his 9 Besides Herodotus, we have incorporated titles from Hecataeus (fr. 332 M?ller), Antiochus of Syracuse (fr. 3 M?ller), Alcmaeon (fr. 1), and Thucydides. It is possi ble that the Mt/cpos At?/coc^os of Democritus had such a title ; cp. Diog. Laert. IX. 41. We have, howTever, what are said to be the opening words of other works, but mention neither the name of the author nor the subject ; e. g. Heraclitus, fr. 1 ; Archytas, fr. 1 ; Anaxagoras, fr. 1 ; Protagoras, fr. 1 and 4 ; Diogenes of Apollonia, fr. 1. For those who hold the fragments attributed to him to be genuine I may add, Philolaus, fr. 1. One may, of course, assume that the incorporated title was in these cases disregarded, either because a formal title had been substituted for it, or because it was considered negligible. The works of Hippocrates, however, do not have incor porated titles naming the author ;. but have in some cases an introductory sentence which announces the subject: e. g. ?. ywaiKe?rjs &lt;p?aLos (7,312 Littr?) irepi ?? rrjs yvpaLK ?7)s &lt;f)?&lt;rios Kai pocrrjfjL?r?vp r??e X?yw ; similarly Democritus, fr. 165 X?yu r??e irepi t?p ?vfjLw?prwp.

I incline to the opinion that the works of the Corpus Eippocrateum (with possibly one or two exceptions) belong to the fifth century ; at any rate, the conceptions and points of view they present show few traces of the influence of Socratic thought. 11 Xen.

Greek philosophy did, indeed, seek the permanent amid the flowing ; but, as the first determined effort of the human mind to frame a sci ence, it sought an explanation of the fleeting phenomena. This ex planation it found ultimately in that which abides, and gave to it various names : but it was not the permanence, but the causality, of the viroKtLfjitvov to which, as scientists, the Greek philosophers devoted their chief attention.12 Aristotle was clearly right in refusing to regard the Eleatics, in so far as they adhered to their metaphysical principles which excluded causality and motion, as &lt;j&gt;v(tlkol. I. "One may say that primitive man has only religious apperceptive niasses." " No matter what historical phenomenon we may trace to a remote past, we come at last to religion. All human conceptions, so far as they fall within the intellectual horizon of a pre-scientific age, have developed out of mythical conceptions ; but religious ideas con stitute the content, or at least, the garb of myth." These words from the pen of the lamented Professor Usener13 strike the key-note of this portion of our study. As later Greek philosophy, so far as it was a philosophy of nature, grew out of the teachings of the pre-Socratics with only here and there a clearly marked infusion of metaphysics, ultimately derived from So crates : so Greek philosophy as a whole was not a creation e nihilo. Long before the dawn of philosophy, properly so-called, the reflective thought of the Greeks had busied itself with many of the problems which later engaged the attention of the philosophers.14 Even if we had no evidence to prove it, we should still have to assume it as a fact. We are not, of course, in position to trace even in the most general 12 In my study, The Necessary and the Contingent in the Aristotelian System, Chicago, 1896, pp. 7-10, I gave a brief analysis of the movement of pre-Socratic thought in logical terms. Somewhat more at length a similar study appeared in The Logic of the Pre-Socratic Philosophy, published as Chapter IX. of Studies in Logical Theory, by John Dewey, Chicago, 1903. 13 Vortr?ge und Aufs?tze, pp. 43 and 45. 14 There is much philosophy held in solution in Greek mythology ; but it is impossible to utilize it for historical purposes, because the early history of the myths is unknown. Unfortunately this is likely always to be the case.</page><page sequence="5">HEIDEL. ? Ilept &lt;J&gt;vct &lt;?S. 83 outlines the stages in the process of organizing the confused mass of primitive human experience into a unified world of thought. We may be sure, however, that there never was a time when the human mind held even two wholly unrelated experiences ; and there will never come a time when all human experiences shall constitute a perfect koV/jios. Somewhere between these limits history moves, the mind now energeti cally striving to achieve a synthesis, now supinely acquiescing in " the cult of odds and ends." When the curtain of history rises on the Greeks, wre find in Homer a strange condition. In the foreground there is a relatively well or dered society of gods and men ; while in the shadows of the background lurk remnants of an ancient barbarism. Politically society is in unsta ble equilibrium, momentarily held together by a common cause : par ticularism clearly preceded, particularism follows. One can with difficulty banish the thought that the union of the Greeks under the suzerainty of Agamemnon was only a poet's dream, ? an ideal never realized and perhaps never to be realized. Homeric religion is in much the same case : Zeus is king of all the gods, but even after his vic tory over the turbulent sons of Earth, his rule is precarious. The Titans fame; and the wife of his bosom nurses thoughts of treason. As for the occurrences of daily life, they are the expression of divine powers 15 lurking everywhere and acting more or less capriciously. Noth ing that occurs occasions much surprise,16 and a ready explanation for even the most unexpected event is suggested by the inscrutable oper ations of the gods. This is not the atmosphere which surrounds and stimulates the birth of philosophy. But while Homer, on the whole, writes for entertainment and tells such tales as may fitly cheer a pleas ant feast, there are not wanting in the Iliad passages which show that the Greeks of that age sometimes thought in a less light-hearted vein. Two portions in particular, the At?? 'A^?r??17 and the ?eo^a^ta, 18 con tain unmistakable vestiges of earlier th?ogonie and cosmogonie poems. The tendency here appearing in Homer finds increasing favor with Hesiod and the cosmogonists of the eighth and seventh centuries b.c. For reasons hardly intelligible to me it has become common to dis 15 Cp. Adam, The Religious Teachers of Greece, p. 22. If Tha?es said irdpra irXf)prj Be?p, it was a survival of ' Homeric ' thought out of harmony with the new philo sophical movement. Such survivals, however, are common in all ages. 16 Cp. Adam, ibid., p. 24. 17 II. XIV. 18 II. xx, xxi. That this passage is cosmological was seen by Theagenes in the sixth century, b.c. (see Schol. II. B on T, 67), and emphasized by Murray, Pise of the Greek Epic, p. 239 if., and by Gilbert, Bie meteorologischen Theorien des griechi schen Altertums, p. 25, n. 2.</page><page sequence="6">84 PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY. tinguish these interesting early thinkers from the illustrious company of the philosophers, headed by Tha?es, as if they belonged to different orders of existence. Certain it is that Aristotle was not aware of any such fundamental difference. " Even a lover of myth," he says,19 " is in a sense a philosopher." Tha?es he calls the founder of the school of philosophy which inquires into the material cause of things ; but he adds,20 almost in the same breath, that "some think that the ancients who lived long before the present generation, and first framed accounts of the gods, had a similar view of nature." By late writers no distinc tion whatever is made between the two classes of thinkers ; thus Hip polytus says,21 "The poet Hesiod himself declares that he thus heard the Muses speak IIcpl ^vo-cw?." Plato, on the other hand, says in a playful vein of the early philosophers,22 " Each appears to me to re count a myth for our entertainment, as if we were children. One says that the things that are are three in number, and that certain of these somehow go to war with one another from time to time ; then again they become ' reconciled, contract marriages, beget children, and rear their offspring. Another says there is a pair, ? Moist and Dry, or Hot and Cold, ? and gives away the bride and lets the pair cohabit. The Eleatic tribe out our way, however, going back to Xenophanes and even farther, recounts its tales as if all beings, so called, were one." However we may interpret the passage in detail, it is obvious that Plato notes and emphasizes the fundamental identity in point of view between the.early cosmogonists and the golden tribe of philosophers. He shows how easy it is to state philosophical conceptions in mytho logical terms, and suggests by implication that the opposite procedure is equally easy. Aristotle also clearly correlates Beo\6yoi and OeoXoy?a with &lt;?vcrioA.?yoi and &lt;j&gt;va-iokoyia in such sort as to show that in his view words and concepts run alike parallel.23 He likens the earliest philosophy toa lisping child,24 and makes repeated attempts to restate in more accept able form the opinions of his predecessors.25 He would doubtless have l?

Ilepl &lt;|&gt;v&lt;r ?&gt;s. 85 offered a like apology, only with larger charity, for the still earlier cosmog onists. Theophrastus 26 in the same spirit remarked upon the ' poetic ' diction of Anaximander because he referred to the mutual encroach ment of the elements as ' injustice/ Indeed, the mythical cast of much of the earlier philosophy is so. marked as to constitute a serious prob lem to the historical student, who desires to interpret fairly the thought of the age. This fact, duly considered, throws light in both directions. It shows, on the one hand, that theogonists and cosmogonists em ployed the names of divinities to designate philosophical, or at any rate, quasi-philosophical concepts ; but it also shows that the philoso phers were not themselves conscious of a complete break with the past. Thus, while the theogonists pictured the origin and operations of the world in terms of the history and behavior of mythical characters, often so vaguely and imperfectly conceived27 as at once to betray their factitious nature, the philosophers applied to their principles and ele ments names and epithets proper to the gods.28 This course was, indeed, extraordinarily easy and natural to the Greeks, whose religion wras in its higher phases essentially a worship of Nature.29 But this very worship of Nature in her more significant aspects was in itselt one of the chief influences which predisposed the Greeks to a philoso phy of Nature. There are certain picturesque effects of this intimate historical con nexion of speculation on nature with theology (in the Greek sense), which are perhaps worth noting. Aristotle repeatedly uses the ex pression /cocr/xov y?vvav alongside KO fjL07roL ?v or KocrfjLoiroda in reference of his precursors in my study, Qualitative Change in Pre-Socratic Philosophy (Archiv, f?r Gesch. der Philos., 1906). There seem still to remain a few scholars who, even after the illustrations of this tendency noted by Natorp (e. g., Philos. Monatshefte, xxx. 345) and Burnet, are unaccountably blind to it. 26 Apud Simpl. In Phys. I. 2, p. 24, 20 (Diels). 27 See, e.g., Diels, Parmenides Lehrgedicht, p. 10 ; Rohde, Psyche, II. 114 and 115, n. 2; Ed.

Empedocles deifies the Sphere, the elements, and the efficient causes, Love and Strife. The practice continues throughout Greek thought. The question is where religious belief ends and metaphor begins : see Millerd, On the Interpretation of Empedocles, p. 34. I do not doubt that Professor Millerd, as well as Gilbert (1. c. and Meteorol. Theorien, etc., p. 110, n. 1) and Adam, The Religious Teachers of Greece, pp. 184-190, 248, 250, go too far in accepting as sober belief what was in fact * poetic ' metaphor. See Burnet, p. 74 foil., p. 288 foil. Rohde says (Psyche n. 2) "Wer unter Griechen unsterblich sagt, sagt Gott : das sind Wechselbegriffe." This statement certainly requires quali fication ; but this is not the place to discuss the matter at length. 29 Ed. Meyer, Gesch. des Altertums, I, a (2d ed.), pp. 97-100, distinguishes,? aside from purely magical beings, ? two classes of gods : I. universal gods, con</page><page sequence="8">86 PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY. to philosophical accounts of creation ;30 and derivative forms of exis tence are called Ikjovol or a-rroyovoL of the elements.31 In other words, the philosophers were in effect giving the genealogy of the world.32 ceived as presiding over certain spheres of the (physical or intellectual) world every, where and for all men ; II. particular gods, having locally or tribally circumscribed spheres. There is, of course, a certain overlapping. The gods of the first class exist as permanent beings by reason of the eternally identical activities proceeding from them ; those of the second class attain permanence and personality by reason of the institution of a fixed cult. Many gods of the first class possess little or no cult, but stand as representatives of natural laws. "No one," says Professor Burnet, p. 75, n. 1, "worshipped Okeanos and Tethys, or even Ouranos." Since the superior gods of Greece are largely of this class, it is not difficult to see how religion proved a schoolmaster to lead the Greeks to philosophy. 30 For examples see Bonitz's Index, 150a 7 foil.

See my article, Qualitative Change in Pre-Socratic Philosophy, notes 36 and 41. 32 In this connexion it is proper to refer to the beginnings of Greek historiography ? both are iaropiai. In each case it is the desire of the ?arwp to go back to first principles. Professor Millerd speaks of Empedocles' Ilepl (pvaetos as a "world story ; " such in truth it is. History appears to have grown up among the Greeks in con nexion with Genealogy, dealing with Kriaeis and other similar events. In Xeno phanes, according to tradition, the two interests of iaropLa were naturally united. His physical derivation of the present world constituted his natural philosophy ; on the historical side, he is reported to have composed poems on the founding of Colophon and the colonization of Elea. While this latter statement may be ques tioned (see Hiller, Rh. M., N. F. 38, 529) on external grounds, it is not per se improbable. The Book of Genesis similarly unites interest in creation and the derivation and early history of a people. It seems to be natural to the human mind to put explanation in the form of a story ; even where it is a question of explaining how present phenomena occur, it is usual to cast the answer into the form of origines. This tendency has misled historians of Greek philosophy at many points into the vain endeavor to distinguish between the current cosmic processes and the story of creation. Another matter of much interest is the relation of creation-story and genealogy, which are thus united in larop?i) irepl &lt;p?aeoos, to the religious lepbs X?yos or gospel. Of this I have spoken incidentally in another con nexion ; but it is obvious, even at a glance, that in Genesis, for example, they are virtually identical. In later schools of Greek philosophy the naturae ratio was clearly and consciously felt to be a gospel. It is therefore interesting to note that of the four Christian Gospels, three in various ways link the gospel story proper with the story of creation. Mark, the "human Gospel," omits this essential link. The later Gospels supply it : Matthew is content to trace the genealogy of Jesus to Abraham, from which point the story was familiar ; Luke carries it back to Adam, "the son of God;" John goes back to the "beginning" and finds the A?yos, or Gospel Incarnate, with God before, and preparatory to, creation. Hence he can dispense with a genealogy. One must bear in mind the supposed compelling force of genealogy in prayers. Among many peoples we find the practice of addressing</page><page sequence="9">HEIDEL. ? Ilepl &lt;(&gt;v'&lt;r ws. 87 The intimate connexion of physical philosophy with theogony and cosmogony has thus been emphasized because it appears fundamental to any intelligent inquiry into the meaning and nature of the former ; yet no one would deny that there is a distinction to be drawn between these cognate forms of speculation on the origin and operations of the world. The important point to determine is just wherein the essential difference consists. In Plato there is a clear distinction drawn between pivOos and \6yog ; with him ?xvOoXoy?a is associated with' ttoltjo-ls, and, when contrasted with ?oyo? or io-Top?a, denotes that which is fictitious as opposed to sober truth. Herein Plato reflects the spirit of the sixth and fifth cen turies, B. c, which brought science to the birth. Of that period Xeno phanes is an interesting representative. We have seen that he com bined the various interests of to-ropta, and he naturally found himself in hostility to Homer 33 and all for which Homer stood. Homer stood for epic poetry, and epic poetry stood for pvOos. To the mind of Xeno phanes the myths of Titans, Giants, and Centaurs are irXdo-jnaTa tw irpor?pt?v . . . ro?cr ovS?v xprjo-Tov evecm. Indeed, what could Such fic tions profit an age that was busily engaged in sweeping the mists from the crest of Olympus to let in the dry light of reason 1 Hecataeus, an other child of the sixth century and a Xoyoyp?fos or devotee of lo-rop?a, in the introductory sentence of his Genealogies, says :34 "I write the following as it seems to me in truth ; for the tales (Ao'yot) of the Greeks are many and, as I think, absurd." He employs the term Ao'yot where a later writer would probably have said jjlvOol ; for he refers to Greek mythical genealogies. Yet \6yos had even in his day come to mean prose 35 as opposed to epic composition, and Hecataeus proposed to use the 'new vehicle of artistic expression in the service of sober truth or to-ropta.36 It is noteworthy that he criticises the stories of "the the gods in prayer and enforcing the fulfilment of the request by giving the genealogy (or as Herodotus, I. 132 says, the Beoyoplrj) of the divinities. This is in turn con nected with the magical procedure, which consists in " assigning the cause " and telling how that which, e. g., produced the wound (say, iron) originated, thus con trolling the cause and effecting a cure. On this see Stewart, The Myths of Plato, p. 10 foil., who calls this the ''aetiological myth." 33 See Diels, Parmenides Lehrgedicht, p. 10. 34 Fr. 332, M?ller. 35 What the substitution of prose for verse meant to philosophical thought can be best appreciated, perhaps, in connexion with Parmenides and Empedocles. Par menides tried to write verse like a philosopher, and was ridiculed as a shabby poet ; Empedocles tried to write philosophy like a poet, and is regarded as a fifth-rate thinker for his pains. 36 For iaroplr/ see Stein on Hdt.

Greeks," 37 finding them utterly ridiculous. The new era of travel and research had brought to light many an evidence that things were not what they seemed, at least that much which passed for true and un questionable among the Greeks was differently conceived or otherwise done in other lands.38 The age of the Sophists merely made common property what had for a hundred years exercised the wits of the great leaders of the new thought. We have seen that Greek religion in the Homeric age harbored two conceptions which contained the promise of disintegration, though they still dwelt peacefully side by side. According to the one conception every event was equally divine and so equally " natural," occasioning no surprise ; according to the other, certain provinces of the world, physical and intellectual, were apportioned to the "wide-ruling gods" of Olympus. The former tended to dull the faculty of curiosity, the latter to stimulate it. For, in a sense, the Olympians were personified laws of Nature. With the increasing organization of experience came greater emphasis upon the " G?tterstaat " and overlordship of Zeus, who assumed more and more the title of Oe?s par excellence and subordinated the lesser gods to himself, reducing them in the end to expressions of his sovereign pleasure. But back of Zeus, even in Homer, lurks the mysterious power of Motpa, before whose might even the "pleasure" of Zeus avails little. As Zeus subdues the lesser gods, so Fate or Law subdues Zeus to her inexorable will. But the bright patterns woven into Greek mythology, based as they were upon personal caprice and 37 Bernays, Abh. der Berl. Akad., 1882, p. 70, refers to Anaxagoras (fr. 17 Diels : rb ?? yipeaBai Kai dir?XXvada? ovk ?pd?s popX?ovaip oi ^XXr/ves), to Hecataeus (fr. 332), Philodemus (II. evae?das p. 84, Gomp. : ?aovs &lt;paaip oi Hap?XXrjpes Oeovs) and adds : "Es ist die vornehme Art der Philosophen von dem Volk zu reden." Compare also Empedocles, fr. 8 and 9 (Diels). The feeling is deeper than mere pride : it marks the exaltation of the philosophical \070s, as the statement of (pvais, over the popular X?70S which stands for poplos and pivdos. Bury, Ancient Greek Historians, p. 51, n. 2, remarks that w7hen Herodotus quotes and criticises oi "EXXr/pes he is contrasting the Greek tradition with that of Phoenicians, Persians, or Egyptians, and "is really quoting criticisms of Hecataeus on oi "EXXrjpes, that is, on the current mythology of epic tradition." 38 It would be foolish to claim for any one cause the determining influence in giving direction and scope to the nascent rationalism of the sixth century. Travel and research could furnish the content and supply the materials for reflective thought ; but both presuppose the divine curiosity which is the parent of philosophy. Many influences conspired to produce the revolution in thought ; but travel may well have contributed most to convert curiosity into astonishment. The curious collections of strange and shocking customs, of which we find echoes in Herodotus, Hippocrates, the AtaX^ets, etc., clearly originated in the sixth century, and supplied the arsenal of the militant Sophists.</page><page sequence="11">HEIDEL. ?

Greek religion experi enced the inevitable conflict between the imagination, the flowering of the capricious faculties of youth, and the reflective reason, in which the maturing powers assert their right to fixed habits of thought. Now &lt;j&gt;vo-Lo\oyicL is simply ?oyos or toTopta 7rcpt &lt;/&gt;ixre(o?, ? the child of the maturing age which set itself to discard or disregard childish things and to see things as they are.

The transition is natural ; but it involves an element of opposition which could not help but be painful and even bitter as the extent and bearings of the inevitable conflict came to consciousness. The history of pre-Socratic philosophy is the history of this conflict ; but the opposition was not final. The strain of conflicting ideals re sulted in a new synthesis. Plato and Aristotle sought to effect such a synthesis, and the endeavor to perfect it is the characteristic of the main current of post-Aristotelian philosophy from the Stoics to Plotinus. Gibbon's saying,39 " Freedom is the first step to curiosity and knowl edge," nowhere finds fuller application or illustration than in the history of Greek philosophical thought; and nowhere did the early Greek thinkers so much feel the need of asserting their freedom as in the sphere of opinion where there was an actual or possible clash with the received theology in the guise of ?jlvOos. From the first, philosophers had broken with it in intention, however much haunted they might have been individually or collectively by presuppositions formulated in their mythology. It should occasion no surprise to find inconsisten cies and lapses from their principles ; for such are common in all ages, because of the imperfect fluidity of the mental content, which refuses to be reshaped at a cast. Nor should we expect to find the principles operating to the regeneration of thought explicitly stated at the be ginning : it is the rule that the clear enunciation of principles follows, often tardily, the tacit application of them. Plato speaks of the ancient feud between poetry and philosophy ; and the point of contention con cerns /xS0oc.40 Plato also well expresses the fundamental difference be tween the two.

In the Epicurean Epistle to Pythocles 44 a distinction is drawn be tween such phenomena as admit of but one rational explanation and such as admit of several explanations equally consonant with the data of sense. In the former, the conclusion must be categorically affirmed ; in regard to the latter, one must suspend judgment : "for one must conduct investigations into the operations of nature, not in accordance with vain dogmas and ex-cathedra pronouncements, but according as the phenomena demand. . . . But when one fails to state one possible ex planation and rejects another that is equally consonant with the data of sense, it is evident that one falls wholly outside the breastworks of science and lapses into /xi)0o?." 45 From the first &lt;$&gt;vo-io\oyLa or laropia irepl &lt;?vo-ea&gt;? is characterized by the fact that it wholly disregards religious authority 46 {vo^o?eo-?a of 43 Repub. 607 B.

Epicurus required that one judge concerning what cannot be seen (r? ??rjXa) on the analogy of that which is visible. In this also he followed the pre-Socratics. See Sext.

But the charge was disingenuous, since the explanation in question was only one of several among which he allowed his followers to choose, since the matter was not one of which strict account was required of the faithful. 46 It would be impossible to prove this without showing in detail ? what is easy but requires more space than can be allotted to it here ? how the conclusions of phi losophers ran from the first counter to the fundamental assumptions of the received theology. The philosophers therefore came to be regarded as a godless crew : cp. Plato, Apol. 18 B C, 19 B, 23 D ; Xen. Mem. I. 2, 31 ; Plut.

If one would catch the spirit of that age one must read the priceless repository of fifth century thought contained in the Hippocratean cor pus and the fragments of the Sophists. So little remains to us of the 47 Rohde, Psyche n. p. 90 draws attention to the conscious opposition of philos ophers to the magicians, etc. The same opposition developed among the philosophical and practical physicians, whence they also have been traditionally denounced as a godless crew.

When later writers charge the Atomists, for example, with having recourse to chance, this is said from the point of view of teleology : a purely physical cause wTas thought to be no cause at all.

The latter were, as is the wont of true men of science, more reserved than the motley crowd of pseudo-scientists who caught up their half-expressed conclu sions and published them in the market places to eager laymen, for whom the scientists entertained only an ill-concealed contempt.52 No opinion was so well established that they would not sap its roots ; no question was too obscure to baffle explanation. A certain decorous respect was still shown for the gods ; but they had in fact become su pernumeraries so far as concerned the explanation of the world. Thus Hippocrates 53 says: " In matters human the divine is the chief cause ; thereafter the constitutions and complexions of women " ; but while the divine is then dismissed, the constitutions and complexions of women are considered at length and made to account for everything. In other cases, as, e. g., in the treatise II. Ieprjs vovo-ov, the gods are definitely ruled out as a particular cause, and only the elemental substances, which rule in the human frame, are recognized as divine.54 Thus the divine working becomes another name for the operation of Nature. A good illustration of this procedure is found in Hippocrates, II. acpwv vS?r?Jv T?7IW. After remarking that the Scythians worship the eunuchs because they attribute their estate to a god and fear a like fate for themselves, the author says:55 "I myself regard this as divine, as well as everything else. One is not more divine nor human 56 than another ; but all are on the same level, and all are divine. Yet every one of these things has its natural cause, and none occurs without a natural cause. I will now explain how in my opinion this comes about." Whereupon the author proceeds to give a purely naturalistic explana tion.

" Every thing has its natural cause and nothing occurs without a natural cause." Nature has usurped the power of deity. Lest any should fail to catch his meaning, the writer, after detailing his naturalistic explanation, repeats: "but as I said above, this is equally divine with other things ; but everything occurs in accordance with natural law." Elsewhere58 Hippocrates suggests that it is ignorance alone which inclines the vulgar to regard epilepsy as a divine visitation. It is in keeping with this view that teleol ogy is excluded ; even where a modern scientist would involuntarily slip into modes of expression which imply final causes, the pre-Socra tics, though at a loss for a satisfactory explanation, offer no such sug gestion.59 To the Socratics it was a scandal that Anaxagoras made no teleological use of his NoS?.60 When nature was thus interpreted, it is clear that the gods must suffer. One recourse was to attribute the organization of the world to them, and then to have done with them. This is suggested by Hip a direct intervention of the gods in the regular course of nature. The scientific assumption of proximate, special causes is perhaps an outgrowth of the suppositions of magic, for which see Ed. Meyer, Gesch. des Altertums, i. (a) p. 97.

Disguise it as he might, Aristotle could find no better solution of the problem. Plato 62 puts the question sharply as between God and Nature, and says that the majority favor the latter. Such, indeed, was for the moment the logical outcome of the pre-Socratic movement of thought. It might be allowed that the idea of God was innate ;63 but, like all other ideas, it was more likely to be regarded as having a history, and as requiring explanation along with the other immediate (&lt;?vcri?) or mediate (vo/xo?) products of nature. Thus, among others, Critias 64 explained belief in the gods as a deliberate fiction concocted by a clever statesman to enforce morality beyond the reach of the law, supporting it with the natural fears inspired in man by r? ^crewpa. It is not necessary here to rehearse the familiar story of rationalism as applied to religion in the fifth century, b.c.; 65 but it is not too much to say that philosophy had deliberately enthroned Nature in the place of God. But nature, thus completely depersonalized, could not so remain indefinitely. Conceived as the power that brings to pass all the events constituting the sum of experience, nature became in fact a Creator and Governor, only deprived of reason and purpose, and identified with the sum of existence.66 The Greek mind, with its plastic imagin ation, was not likely, however, permanently to acquiesce in this imper sonal view of nature, although Qvo-is was extremely late in attaining personification as a deity.67 Yet, as we shall see,68 a good beginning was made in the pre-Socratic period.

From Plato onwards, with few exceptions, philosophers proceed with the synthesis: the gods act according to the laws of nature, and Nature assumes the divinity of the gods. II. After thus sketching the setting of those works which by common consent bore the title liepl ^vo-cw?, it is proposed in this section to con sider the use of the term &lt;j&gt;vo~ls among the Greeks of the pre-Socratic period. Although this study is based upon a collection of passages nearly if not quite complete, it is not intended to treat the subject ex haustively, classifying each occurrence of the term. Such an exhibit, if carefully and intelligently made, would serve a valuable purpose ; its main uses would, however, be lexicographical rather than historical and philosophical. The purpose of this section is the more modest one of determining somewhat roughly the range of the term &lt;?iW, in the period under discussion, as an index of the scope of the conception of Nature. While the chief emphasis will properly fall on works to be dated before 400 b.c., we shall have occasion to use, with proper pre cautions, also certain writings of later date, such as those of Plato and Aristotle. Indeed, the careful student is not likely to be greatly mis led in this matter by any text of ancient Greek literature. The reason is already clear. The philosophy of the Greeks prior to 400 b.c., with the sole exception of that of Socrates, may all be properly described as concerning itself 7rept ^crcco?. As such it is sharply contrasted with the later systems, the main interest of which, with few and relatively unimportant exceptions, lies elsewhere : to wit, in the spheres of logic, ethics, and metaphysics. This new interest did not date from Socra tes, but had, like all conceptions, an interesting history. If we were here concerned with this history we should have to retrace our steps, beginning once more with Homer and the popular notions of the Greeks embodied in religion, mythology, and moral precepts. But all this would yield at most a Vorgeschichte ; for the method, which alone is of importance in philosophy proper, was created by Socrates. There are, strictly speaking, only two periods in the history of occi dental philosophy, the pre-Socratic and the Socratic. The first took external Nature as its point of departure, and fixed for all time the fundamental conceptions of physical processes. Even where it con sidered biological and intellectual processes, it started with mechanical notions and arrived in the end at materialistic conclusions. We may, if we choose, speak of the ethics or metaphysics of the pre-Socratics ;</page><page sequence="18">96 PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY. but every careful student will be conscious of a fundamental difference. Socrates, by introducing the logical method of definition, based upon induction and employed in the interest of deduction, discovered a new order of existence, which was subject not to mechanical, but to teleological laws. Teleological facts were known from the beginning of time, and, as we have seen, Nature herself became, in the latter part of the pre-Socratic period, charged with personality in a measure which made a new interpretation of her operations a foregone conclu sion ; but teleology, considered as a method of explanation, was a dis covery of the Socratics. The significance of this fact can hardly be measured ; certainly it has not been appreciated hitherto by historians of philosophy. Among the pre-Socratics conceptions have been found which were certainly alien to their range of thought ; and the fundamental significance of the revolution wrought by Socrates still awaits the appreciation which is its due. Henceforth the world is definitively divided into two spheres, one subject to mechanical, the other subject to final, causes. The latter alone is really "intelligible " ; of the other we may say on, not Sloti. The later Greek systems owe their basic physical concepts ulti mately, and almost exclusively, to the pre-Socratics: where these con ceptions were in any way modified, the reasons for the change are commonly to be sought in obviously logical or metaphysical considera tions traceable to the Socratics. Hence the two discrete streams of philosophical thought, though externally united, flow in the main peacefully side by side, clear and transparent everywhere save at the line of contact, where they become a trifle turbid. Plato and Aristotle constantly betray their dependence upon the predecessors of Socrates for their physical concepts ; and where the post-Aristotelians departed from the specifically Platonic-Aristotelian doctrines, they harked back frankly to one or another of the pre-Socratics for their physical theories. In the following synopsis the attempt has been made to classify the uses of the word &lt;j&gt;v&lt;tls in such sort as to suggest their relations one to another and to the root-meaning, which is assumed to be "growth." The scheme makes no claim to finality or completeness, being intended primarily as a means of displaying in a more or less logical order the chief connotations of the term. The inner history of the semasiology may be left to others whose interests incline them to such studies.69 69 I regret to say that I have not been able to obtain Ber Begriff der Physis in der griechischen Philosophie, I Theil, von E.

There are several words of similar origin and meaning which should be studied in connex ion with (pv?TLS if a really exhaustive account of the word is to be given from a lexi cographical point of view.

This conception was to the Greeks so obvious 70 that the fact of natural growth lay at the foundation of their thought. Growth implies life, and life implies motion. This is true of Greek thought always. The growth denoted by &lt;?&gt;v&lt;ris refers to animal as well as to vegetable life ; wherefore c?&gt;vtov appears originally to have applied to the former as well as to the latter. It is noteworthy that cj&gt;vo-Ls, as implying motion, seems always to denote a process or a phase of such process ; that is to say, specifically the process itself* taken as a whole,71 or its beginning, progress, or end. It does not lend itself, therefore, to use as an absolute ?pxv ' it is consequently always opposed, or subordinated to, creative force as such.72 These ideas clearly hark back to the pre-Socratic period. In Empedocles we find &lt;I&gt;vo-ls, in the sense of absolute origination, denied ;73 in Aristophanes 74 we find &lt;??W in the sense of origin. It is difficult to classify certain uses of &lt;?ixri?, where it may be rendered birth, descent, age, lineage, etc., but they may be set down here for convenience.75 But &lt;?vW, as a process, may be viewed abstractly (I.

Though they often connote other notions, such as cause, their fundamental reference seems to be to what we call law. The frequency of such phrases is significant of the prevailing suggestion which &lt;?ixris had for the investigators irepi &lt;j&gt;vo-cw&lt;$. There is here a marked contrast between the implicit and explicit signification of terms. Such phrases as irap? &lt;?&gt;vo-iv have no proper sense except in relation to a teleological interpretation of nature ;83 but it is obvious that the pre-Socratics were not aware of this implication. They built up a structure of conceptions which of necessity led to teleology, but it was felt instinctively the parallelism of human and physical law, but the latter was con sciously their point of departure. Yet in trying to interpret physical law, they necessarily imported conceptions derived from human law, as, e.g. the dt/07 of Anax imander and Heraclitus. When Simonides said ?v?yKa 5' ov?? Oe?i ?idxopr ai he meant much the same as the (intermittent) tyranny of Mo?pa in Homer.

Of course, in an age when (pvais and p?paos were contrasted, the opposite interpretation would also be found ; cp. Plato, Protag. 337 C foil., Hdt., in. 38, vi. 104, Critias, fr. 25 (Diels). Cp. Galen, De Usu Partium, xi. 14 (in. 905 f. K?hn), and Nestle, Neue Jahrb. f?r d. klass. Altert., 1909, p. 10 foil. Zeller, Ueber Begriff u. Begr?ndung der sittlichen Gesetze, Abh. d. Berl.

IIcpl 4&gt;v&lt;T ?s. 101 the Socratics who seized the import of their labors, and, by introducing the teleological method, reconstituted philosophy. Even in the post Socratic period teleology, because seen essentially from the pre-Socratic point of view, became, for example among the Stoics, an idle play-thing, being purely external.84 The step is short and easy from &lt;?vo-i?, regarded as a process eventu ating in a result, to &lt;?iW considered as the author or source of that which so results (IL). The distinction must lie in the degree of em phasis laid upon the beginning of the process as distinguished from its end, and, by consequence, in the degree of disruption visited upon the process as a whole. Such a separation is the result of analysis, and the relative prominence of the members into which the unitary process falls may reasonably be supposed to indicate the direction of interest of those who used the terms. This is, however, a point extraordinarily difficult to determine in a satisfactory way. It is safe to say that the layman is chiefly interested in &lt;/&gt;w-i?, the result of the nature-process : he takes it for granted ? his not to question w7hy. It must, therefore, occasion no surprise that by far the most numerous uses of &lt;f&gt;va-Ls belong to this class (III). The philosopher, also, must begin with the finished product and from it reason back to its source. In a peculiar way &lt;?&gt;vo-ic in this sense (II.) will occupy his attention ; but it is obvious that the distinction between cause and law must be difficult to draw. Even in the philosophical and scientific literature of our day it is almost im possible to maintain a sharp distinction between them. We may be inclined to lay this to the charge of the Aristotelian usage ; but this solution would fall short of historical truth. As we shall see, the four fold causation of Aristotle, united in cfrvo-Ls, is rooted in pre-Socratic usage, though Aristotle reinterpreted the pre-Socratic ?oyo? ?ufew?, or chemical definition, converting it into a Xoyo? ovo-?as as the result of logical definition, and at the same time made explicit the unconscious teleology of the pre-Socratics by recognizing in the logical definition the final cause. Touching the beginning of the process, the philosophers were chiefly interested in what Aristotle styled the "material cause" (II. A). There is no reason to doubt that the pre-Socratics used &lt;j&gt;v&lt;ris in this sense.85 Aristotle speaks of Tha?es as the founder of the philosophy 84 From certain points of view modern philosophy, from Kant onwards, may be said to be the attempt to interpret the world in terms of teleology consciously conceived as the method of human thought. At bottom Pragmatism is hardly any thing more than an effort to do this consistently, leaving no Absolute outside the teleological process. 85 It is one of the many services of Burnet (see above, n. 3) that he directed</page><page sequence="24">102 PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY. which deals with the material cause,86 and says that the majority of the first philosophers regarded material causes as the sole causes of all things.87 Empedocles 88 uses &lt;?vW of the substance contributed by the parents to the birth of their offspring, and Hippocrates 89 does so likewise in the same connexion. In another passage Hippocrates well illustrates this force of &lt;?vVi?. He is engaged in a polemic against the monists, who assert that all is one, and makes the point that a living being does not arise from even a multiplicity of substances unless they are mixed in the right proportions,90 and hence ? fortiori, could not arise from a single substance. He then proceeds :91 " Such being the attention to this usage, though I cannot but differ from him in the interpretation of individual texts. It would serve no useful purpose to specify further instances. But it should be noted that &lt;p?ais in this sense means * natural kind,' and hence is proba bly derived from in. A, 2.

It clearly presupposes and combats the theory of Diogenes of Apollonia (cp. espec. fr. 3, beginning). For the interpretation of Empedocles the statements regarding fit conditions of mixture for y?peais are of especial interest, since they imply definite proportions and the admixture of all four elements. The intimate relation of Empedocles to the medical schools should be constantly borne in mind. Medicine, so far as it consisted in the ministration of medicaments, was essentially the art of interfering in the microcosmic ir?Xepios, which reproduced in miniature the cosmic ir?Xepios, and of preventing ?iriKpdreia of the several elements by combatting the overbearing and assisting those which were in danger of succumbing. One might be misled into supposing that Greek prescriptions were not precise, because few such are found in Hippocrates. The reason, I believe, is that Hippocrates insisted on a minute study of the individual case, for which precise prescriptions for general distribution would be unsuitable. That prescriptions were given by formula we know : cp.

Here we find peacefully side by side two uses of &lt;?iW, (1) that of elemental constituent and (2) that of the resultant constitution. Among the strict monists there would be no real distinction, and thus there would be a show of reason for Professor Burnet's main contention if one limited its application to the Ionians and insisted on a strictly monistic interpretation of their thought ;94 but where a multiplicity of elemental constituents are recognized, the two uses must differ at least 92 This is interesting and important in view of its evident dependence upon Empedocles. Those who incline to regard Empedocles as a shifty and inaccurate pseudo-philosopher and decline to take seriously his doctrine of /?t?ts, as does Profes sor Millerd, On the Interpretation of Empedocles, p. 39 foil., should reckon with Hippocrates instead of relying entirely on scraps of his philosophical poem, espe cially when Aristotle agrees with Hippocrates. The fact that Aristotle found Em pedocles' doctrine of the elements inconsistent with Aristotle's own misinterpretation of Empedocles' "union into one " (Millerd, p. 40) means absolutely nothing to those who know how prone the Stagirite was to find his own "indeterminate matter" in his predecessors. (See my essay Qualitative Change, etc., and Burnet, 2d ed. p. 57.) The fact is, and it ought to be emphasized, that the significance for the pre-Socrat ics of a knowledge of Hippocrates has been too much neglected even by scholars otherwise competent. The study of Qualitative Change which I published in 1906 would have gained immensely in value if I had then realized the evidential value of the Hippocratean corpus and of general Greek literature for these subjects and had incorporated the materials drawn from these sources which were then at my command. This is not, however, the proper occasion for a rehandling of that whole question, and it must therefore be postponed. 93 This passage well illustrates the fact that, while the philosopher does speak of the elemental substance as 0&amp;rts, when he uses the term in a general way, as, e.g. the, Quais of a man or the Qvo-ls of the universe, he means the "constitution" of things. This agrees well with the conclusion of Professor Millerd, On the Interpre tation of Empedocles, p. 20. 94 Such an interpretation I cannot accept for the lonians (see my Qualitative Chamge, etc.), since strict monism implies the interpretation of rb ?p as rb 6/uloiop, which appears distinctly first in the Eleatics. Even Diogenes is not to be regarded as a consistent monist, since he admitted distinctions in his One.</page><page sequence="26">104 PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY. in this, that in the second sense $iW is a collective comprising the individual &lt;?iW? 9^ of which it is the sum.96 It is probable that Democritus also spoke of the atoms as &lt;?vW in the sense of elemental constituents of things, though this is not alto gether certain.97 Burnet likewise discovers this meaning in a frag ment98 of Diogenes of Apollonia, though as a would-be consistent monist Diogenes could ill distinguish. Closely allied to this force of &lt;?&gt;v(tis is that in which &lt;f&gt;v&lt;rL&lt;s appears as the natural or original place or condition of a thing. Thus Hippocrates99 speaks of a joint, in dislocation, as leaving, and on being replaced, as returning to, its cfrvo-Ls. It will be recalled that, according to Aristotle, each element has its oLKuos T07TO? to which it betakes itself as naturally as a cat returns home. Thus we find r) aplata &lt;?uVi? denoting the original form or condition in Plato,100 and &lt;/&gt;ixri? coupled with apxata Karao-racm ; but these turns lead naturally, if indeed they do not belong, to the use of &lt;?vo-i? as constitution. 95 The plural (p?creis, in this sense, is rare, cp. Arist., Met. 987a 17 ; [Arist.], Be Mundo, 396M4; Philodem., Be Morte (Diels, VorsoJcr.,2 385, 17). [Plato], Epin. 981 D, uses the singular, not the plural, as one might gather from Diels, Elementum, p. 22. 96 The recognition of this is common ; e.g. Hippocrates, II. &lt;pvo~Los dpBp?irov, 4 (6, 38 foil.

The phenomena of life, cosmic and microcosmic, seeming to occur spontaneously and without external cause101 and direction, naturally engrossed the attention of the philosopher and might well make it appear possible to dispense with a special cause of motion. Aris totle 102 complains that the first philosophers did not concern them selves with this question, confining themselves to the investigation of the material cause ; and such anticipations of his efficient cause as he finds in the early cosmogonists and cosmologists bear the stamp of vital and psychic agencies, hardly distinguishable from the personifica tions of mythology. From these facts divergent conclusions have been drawn, some assuming that the mythical conceptions continued essen tially unchanged, others finding a refined animism to which they give the name of bylozoism or hylopsychism. The first conclusion is shown to be false by the mechanical interpretation put upon the activities of the mythically named agencies ;103 the second presupposes distinc tions which developed only at a later period.104 In general the phil osophers appear to have contented themselves with the recognition of the autonomy of nature, assigning no ground for her activity, since she seemed herself to be the sufficient explanation of events. The strict exclusion of divine agency not unnaturally suggests a conscious effort to eliminate such interference, though this inference might be wrong ; on the other hand the habit of saying that certain phenomena occur " of themselves " or "of necessity" or "by chance" gave, as we have seen, great offense to the teleological Socratics. A modern philoso pher, conscious of the difficulties presented by an attempt to define causality and necessity, would judge these early thinkers with less severity. But the constant criticism of pre-Socratic philosophers by their Socratic successors, due to the teleological prepossessions of 101 Spontaneous generation of animal life, for example, seems to have been gener ally accepted for lower forms. As philosophy advanced the higher forms of life were included, at least at the beginning of the world. 102 Aristotle, Met. 984a 18-985b 22. Cp.

The use of &lt;t&gt;vo-is, with more or less personification, as the author of a process (II. B), appears relatively late, as we should expect.106 Hip pocrates speaks of Nature as arranging the vitals in the inner parts ;107 says of the auricles of the heart that they are instruments by which she takes in the air, adding that they seem to be the handi work of a good craftsman ;108 refers to the vis rnedicatrix naturae^ Nature having discovered the methods without understanding and un taught ;109 she makes glands and hair ;110 she can prepare the way for and offer resistance to instruction ;11A she is all-sufficient ;112 she 105 It is perhaps unnecessary to cite passages, but the intrinsic interest of the following may justify one in quoting it.

Aside from such utterances as these 118 we are reduced to inferences from the general doctrines of philosophers, but it is not our plan to pursue this subject here.

This view of Nature was henceforth to prevail in ever-widening circles. We now turn to consider &lt;f&gt;vo-is regarded as the end of the process (III.). As has already been said the number and variety of cases which fall under this head are very great compared with the foregoing. In most respects there is little occasion for special remark in this connex ion, since the usage of the pre-Socratic period coincides in the main with that of later times. Yet there are implications involved in this same usage which were drawn out and made explicit only in the Socratic age. Most interesting of all, perhaps, is the complete inver sion of the conclusions of homely common sense and common usage in troduced by the doctrine of Aristotle. Thus, e. g., he says :120 " From what has been said, then, it is plain that &lt;?iW, in the primary and strict sense, is the substantial entity (ovo-la ? ^uVts III.) of things which have in themselves, as such, a source of movement ; for the matter is called &lt;?wi? (IL A) by reason of having a capacity to take this on, and the processes of becoming and growing (4&gt;v&lt;tis I.), by reason of being derived from it." In the circular process of the Socratic the end has become the beginning ; that which the pre-Socratic called the reality has become a bare potentiality. Neither premise nor conclusion of this view would have been acceptable or even intelligible to the pre Socratic, although, with one exception, the conceptions upon which the new view rests were common property. Yet that one exception is the corner-stone of Socratic philosophy. When the pre-Socratic asked what a thing was, the answer he desired, if given with ideal completeness, would have presented its chemical formula. Now a formula is, I suppose, in origin and intention, a pre scription. In the pre-Socratic schools, closely associated as they were with the schools of medicine, this procedure was natural : furthermore it was adequate, since the " things " they sought to define were ma terial. But, as we have already seen, the Nature which the philosopher studied became at the end of the pre-Socratic period so charged with spiritual meaning, and in particular in the kingdom of v?/w, the son of cfcvo-is, there was so much, non-material in character, which called for analysis, that a method of definition suited to the new objects of study became an urgent necessity. If the old method sought a d?fini .personality with which the debs of Xenophanes is invested, especially as the negation of the popular view of the gods is so pronounced. What remains after the denials, while containing elements of personality, appears shadowy. 120 Met. 1015? 13 foil., transi, of Ross, modified.</page><page sequence="31">HEIDEL, ? Il pl &lt;j&gt;\J&lt;T ?&gt;S. 109 tion of the material thing, yielding, as its final result, the formula of its productions origin with a view to its possible reproduction, the new method proposed to define the idea of the thing. Henceforth it mat tered little whether the thing was material or not ; nor did it matter whether it was actually or only " potentially " existent. These distinc tions did not and could not arise until the new method supplanted that of the pre-Socratics.121 The thing itself has a beginning, a source, and a history : it is transient. The idea of the thing (for the Socratic) had no relation to beginnings or history : it is eternal. The idea of a key, for example, is totally different from the key itself. The key is of brass or of iron : that is to say, it is defined with reference to its material source : the definition of the idea of a key, however, looks inevitably to its purpose, or end. Thus the limits of the process of &lt;/&gt;i;o-i?, erected by this two-fold method of definition, are polar opposites. In either direction the quest was for the truly existent, and, the human mind being constituted as it is, the ultimate existence must be the first cause. To the Socratic the first cause must -be the end or purpose ; but, since historically this conception was a cadet and could not wholly supplant the first-born, the end must be in the beginning, even if it be only " potentially " present there. Like most Socratic ideas, the conception of the causality of &lt;/&gt;vVi?, as the end of a process, was involved in many pre-Socratic expressions, though their significance was not realized. Attention was directed above to instances of personification (involving agency) of &lt;f&gt;v&lt;n&lt;s in the sense of constitution, talent, etc., falling under III. The same implication belongs to 7ri(j&gt;vK and &lt;f&gt;vo-w ?x^i with the infinitive. Nature thus becomes, as it is by Aristotle expressly re garded, a circular process, in which the end of one cycle is the begin ning of another : ?v6po)7ros avOpayrrov ycvra. The kvkXo? yevecrewc thus established is, however, for the pre-Socratic a real process, with a clear history, comparable to the Orphic cycle, in which the immortal soul experiences the vicissitudes incident to sin. In Aristotle, where the process as a whole is all in all, the single moment tends to assume the guise of something having a reality only for the theorist, ? a kind of psychologists' fallacy. 121 Hippocrates, II. r?xvr/s, 2 (6, 2 foil. Littr?) is an interesting discussion of the "existence" of arts, which could not have taken the form it actually takes if the Aristotelian distinctions had been current. "Potentiality" and "actuality" have no significance in relation to things which have a real history ; the terriis acquire meaning only in relation to an ideal construction, such as we find in the Aristotelian system, where the definition of the ovaia of a thing has reference to its realization of an end as seen from without. Teichm?ller, strangely enough, imported these con ceptions into the pre-Socratics.</page><page sequence="32">110 PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY. It has already been said that the practical man is concerned chiefly with the product, which he takes roughly for granted without too much curiosity as to its origin ; but he is intensely interested in its uses, what ever they may be. He does not reflect upon even this circumstance, however, proceeding in his pragmatic way to do the work in hand. When therefore he speaks of &lt;?vW it is generally some aspect of nature as it is that he has in view. From this attitude springs the common usage of philosophical and quasi-philosophical circles, which regards chiefly things as things, without too much implication of further ques tionings. In so far as there is a suggestion of further questions, they concern the "constitution" of the thing ? that is, "what it is" ex pressed in terms of "what it is made of." This is the regular sense of the phrase irepi ^vo-ews as applied in titles of the works of Hippo crates,122 and there is no reason to think that it bore a different sense when used as a title of distinctively philosophical writings. If it were our purpose to treat fully of the uses of &lt;?iW we should have to gather and discuss here the multitudinous meanings of the term which fall under the third head. This we could not do, however, with out unduly and unprofitably increasing the bulk of this study ; for most developments of (?iW, regarded as the end of ther process (III.), are of slight interest for the particular purposes of our inquiry. We may therefore here content ourselves with a summary glance at the ramifica tions of this main branch, adding such observations as may serve to throw light on philosophical and scientific conceptions. We may then regard 4&gt;vo-l&lt;$, as the end of the pro'cess, from without or from within. As seen from without it is the outward constitution or frame of a thing (III. A) ; viewed from within, it is its inner consti tution or character. Under the former head we may distinguish (1) the individual frame,123 (2) the specific or generic,124 (3) the uni 122 See above, n. 10 and n. 93. The titles of Hippocrates are probably not origi nal, since in many instances they are in doubt, some works that bear specific titles being clearly parts of larger wholes. This is in keeping with the facts mentioned below, n. 204, relative to philosophical works. But in the case of Hippocrates the title in most cases merely reproduces in abbreviated form the subject as stated in the body of the work ; and the invariable meaning of (p?ais, when used by Hippocrates in reference to the subject-matter of discourse, is " constitution." 123 In the individual,, (pvais denotes primarily the (perfect) stature attained, eis ?p?pa r?Xeiop, els pi?rpop ijXiK?as, as Paul says, Eph. 4, 13.

Difficult, and in some cases impossible, it is to distinguish clearly between the outward frame or constitution and the inner constitution or character of things (III. B). Each &lt;j&gt;vo-i&lt;s or frame has its inner constitution corresponding to it, which will of course vary according as the &lt;?iW in question is individual, generic, or uni versal. Description or definition of the &lt;?vo-is relates the individual or generic to the universal. Of course the crude methods of description and definition in use in the pre-Socratic period were not consciously generalized ; but there was an evident desire, manifested most clearly in the parallel drawn between the microcosm and the cosmos, to find the universal in the particular. In accordance with the chemical mode of definition in vogue this desire assumed the form of the postulate that the constitution of individual things was the same as that of the world as a whole. We may, if we choose, denounce this procedure as crude logic, but it was instinctive logic, or logic in the making, for all that. The differentiae specificae were found chiefly in the propor tions of the Xoyo? /xt^ew?, although this method was to a limited extent supplemented, though perhaps nowhere wholly supplanted, by the differentiation introduced in the universal through rarefaction and con densation, or ? what practically amounts to the same thing ? through heat and cold. As to the universal, the wide-spread conviction that each thing shares the attributes, or rather the constituents, of the world one and all in varying proportions, served as a bond of union, making things, on the physical side, capable of interaction, and, on the intel lectual side, capable of being comprehended. The motive that inspired the postulation of a common principle for the explanation of the mani fold data of sense is particularly evident in the case of the Pythagor eans, whose postulate that all is at bottom number or numerical relation has no meaning except that of rendering phenomena intelligible. This is clear even without accepting the so-called fragments of Philolaus, in which it is expressly stated. To Aristotle this principle descended in two forms. For physical theory, it provided a basis of interaction, specific differentiae, of which we have an early example in Horn. Od. 10, 303, the .

Under (2) we might likewise include many uses in which (pvais = ?vpapus, since the pier pa of (pvais and ?upapLis are specific differentiae. Cp. n. 85 above and n. 113, where natural kinds are called (p?aios ?Xaarr)pLara. - * 125 In this sense (p?ais practically = K?apios. For the uses of K?apios see Bernays, Abh. der Akad.

For logical theory, again, the universal is the foundation of the intelligible world. It was said above that while the inquiry irepl ^?o-ewc regarded pri marily the constitution of the world, viewed as a given fact, it did naturally imply a question as to its constituents and hence as to its origin. To this we have now added that this implied question in volved for nearly all philosophers of early Greece the conception of &lt;t&gt;vo-is as a Aoyo? /???eus.126 In effect we had already adverted to this fact in referring to the chemical definition of things as a congener of the med ical prescription. In a curious passage127 Aristotle dimly perceives that the Ao'yo? ?li?eus, which he appears to recognize only in Empedo cles, is intimately related to logical definition, though he seems more fully aware of their differences than of their fundamental likeness. Chemical definition seeks to determine what matter entered into the making of the thing. Whether this matter is of one or more kinds makes little difference ; since even the monist must somehow give variety to his unitary substance, and the Greek monists in particular appear to have conceived of concrete things as ' blends y of the deriva tive forms of matter. Logical definition, on the other hand, aims to discover what meanings or marks (teleologically interpreted) constitute the idea of the thing. Each method arrives at a ?o'yo? : the first at a Xoyos /?tocios ; the second, at a ?oyo? ovo-?as.12* In the Aristotelian scheme &lt;?ucri?, as the Aoyo? ovo-?as, is the " formal cause." Among the pre-Socratics, the Aoyo? /ufccos of the cosmos was the object of scienti fic inquiry ; and it was &lt;/&gt;wi? in this sense which, as we have seen, appears in the titular Ilept &lt;?i&gt;o-6w?. Thus far we have considered chiefly the physical &lt;?ixri? or constitu tion (III. B, 1) ; but we must not overlook the fact that with the 126 Cp. n. 90 above. For (pvais involving X?70S piit-eus see Parmenides, fr. 16 and Epicharmus, fr. 2. The latter fragment, whether rightly or wrongly attributed to 1 Epicharmus, clearly reflects the thought of Heraclitus, a supposed monist. On this subject see my study of Qualitative Change. 127 Be Partt. Animal. 642 a 2-31. The passage is too long to transcribe, but will well repay study. 128 I cannot help feeling that the periphrastic use of (p?ats is a by-product of logical definition and hence essentially peculiar to the Socratic period.

(fr. 11), in Philolaus casts grave suspicion on the supposed fragments ; for ovala in the pre-Socratics means not 'essence,' but 'reality.' Natorp, to be sure, in Philos.

Thus Qvo-is positively regarded (III. B, 2 a), is as (native) endowment, talent, instinct, power, etc., opposed to (acquired) virtue, art, experience, wisdom ;129 negatively con ceived (III. B, 2 b), 4&gt;v&lt;tls marks the bounds set by nature to every creature, beyond which it may not pass.130 III. A glance at the survey just given of the uses of &lt;?lW will satisfy ,anyone that the conception of Nature in tfie pre-Socratic period was developed to a point at which little remained to be added. Certainly little was added in the course of subsequent Greek thought. Already our conclusion as to the connotation of &lt;?uVis when used as a compre hensive term has been, stated ; but it is desirable that this conclusion be confirmed by a consideration of the questions raised by those who wrote llc/ot &lt;^i;o-ea)?. Many a word having a wide range of meanings in the course of its development receives at different times an emphasis 129 Examples of native endowment, talent, or power, are exceedingly common ; cp. Protagoras, fr. 3 ; Epicharmus, fr. 40 ; Critias, fr. 9 ; Democritus, fr. 21, 33, 176, 183, 242, etc. Of (pvais = instinct we have an instance in Democritus, fr. 278. In Democritus, fr. 267 (pvais means 'birthright.' 130 "The metes and bounds of providence" furnish a favorite theme to singers and sages of all ages and peoples. Cp. for example, Psalm 104. Greek mythology found a text in the extravagance of the elemental water and fire respectively in the flood and in the conflagration of the world due to the escapade of Phaethon. Anaxi mander and Heraclitus called in the cosmic o?Kr? to curb such transgression. Xenophanes also recognized this principle in the periodicity of cosmic processes. With later philosophers it was a common theme. Democritus, fr. 3, couples ?vpapas and (p?ais ; cp. also Archytas, fr. 1, and Herodotus, 8, 83. In Herodotus, 7, 16 a, it is said that the winds do not suffer the sea (pvai rrj ?wvrrjs xP&amp;aBai, which is explained afterwards by reference to ??pis. On this see my review of Hirzel, Themis, Bike, und Verwandtes, in A. J. P., xxix, p. 216 foil. In Thucydides, 2, 35, 2 vir?p rr?p (pvaip is set definitely in relation to (pB?pos, which opens up the kindred subject of the jealousy of the gods visited upon all who transgress their proper pier pa, as we find it developed in the tragedians and Herodotus. In fact all things have their limitations, even God, according to the Greeks. There is an interesting pass age in Hippocrates, IT. r?xvr/s, 8 (6, 12 Littr?), where, after rebuking unreasonable critics of the art of medicine, the author says : ei y dp ris r) r?xprjp, es ? ?rj r?xpy, r} (p?aip, es ? pLT] (pvais ir?(f)VKep, d^i?aeie ?vpaaBai, ?ypoe? ?ypoiap ?ppiofovaap p,ap'ir? piaXXop $ dpLaBlr}. &amp;p ydp iarip ijp?p r?ia? re r&amp;p (pva?wp ro?a? re rG&gt;p rex^?ojp opydpois eiriKpar?eip, rovr?wp ?arlp rjpi?p ?rjpnovpyo?s e?pai, ?XXup ?? o??k earip. As limitation and definition are the basis of intelligence and the guaranty of sanity, the Greeks had an antipathy to all extravagance. This appears most clearly in their aversion to the ?-rreipop in all forms. VOL.

We have had occasion to note this tendency in regard to &lt;f&gt;vais and have seen,, for example, that the per sonification of Nature has a clear history, arriving at the close of the pre-Socratic period at a stage that rendered the subsequent teleologi cal interpretation of the world a foregone conclusion. It behooves us, therefore, to inquire what were the principal questions asked concern ing Nature in the pre-Socratic period, in order, if possible, to deter mine the direction of interest upon which depends the selection of meanings attached to the term &lt;j&gt;vo-ls. We may prosecute this inquiry in either of two ways. First, we may study the fragmentary remains of the literature of pre-Socratic philosophy and extract from its implicit logic the answer to our ques tion. Or we may approach the matter indirectly, asking what were the ideals of science in that age as we find them reflected in the non philosophical or only quasi-philosophical literature of the time and of the following period which received its inspiration from the pre Socratics. Strictly both methods should be followed conjointly ; for only thus could we arrive at a conclusion that might be justly regarded as definitive. But a moment's thought will convince any reader that the limits of such a study as this could not possibly be made to yield to a detailed examination of the individual systems with a view to deducing from them the interests of their propounders. So compre hensive a review must be undertaken in connexion with a history of early Greek philosophy, which is not, and cannot be, the scope of this study. Our attention shall, therefore, be directed to the second means of approach, with only an occasional glance at the systems of the pre-Socratic philosophers themselves. We may pursue this course with the better conscience because it is self-evident that the scientific ideals of the age were, or soon became, common property, to the defini tion and development of which every man of science contributed what he had to offer. Nowhere does the unity of pre-Socratic thought more clearly appear than in this field, where philosophers and medical theorists cooperated in laying broad and sure foundations. Hippocrates gives us the best glimpse of the scientific ideals of the age ; and it will prove worth our while to pause for a moment to learn what he has to teach us. The true physician is called the child of his art ;131 he is disinterested in his devotion to it, since the love of one's art involves necessarily a love of mankind.132 The charlatan was 131 napa77 ^at&gt; 7 (9, 260 Littr?) t'^rp?s ?yadbs . . . opi?rexvos KaXe?pLepos. 132 Among the virtues which the physician is said to possess in common with the philosopher in n. evaxw0^7)*} 5 (9&gt; 232 Littr?) is d(piXapyvpir). n. irjrpov, 1 (9,</page><page sequence="37">HEIDEL. ?

In like manner Plato, Euthyph. 3 D, explains his lavish expenditure of wisdom as due to (piXapBpwiria, which would not only refuse to accept remuneration but would even display itself in paying the listener to boot. It seems evident that the exalted and even extravagant disinter estedness of Socrates reflects, though it doubtless carried beyond the common practice, the teaching of the medical schools, and possibly also of the early philosophical schools. In the medical "OpKos (4, 628 foil., Littr?) the physician swears to regard his teacher as a father, sharing with him his substance, and his teacher's sons as his brothers ; if they desire to learn medicine, he swears ?i?d?eip rrjp r?%vr]P ra?rwp . . . ?pev piiaBov ko? ?vyypafrrjs.

The physician will not indulge in useless dialectics,136 but if he knows his art he will prefer to show it by deeds rather than words.137 Life is fleeting, art is long,138 and a cure may depend upon the moment.139 Hence the physician must not restrict his attention to rational inference but must resort to the rule of rote to gether with reason ; 140 he must therefore have a knowledge of prac tice as well as of theory.141 The main object of medicine is to effect a cure;142 above all the physician should avoid making much ado and accomplishing nothing.143 The art of medicine is not, however, a mere routine ; a good share of the ability of the physician is shown in. his capacity to judge correctly touching what has been written ;144 for science is constituted by observations drawn from every quarter and brought into a unity.145 An art or science attests its reality by what it accomplishes.146 The art of medicine cannot always arrive at absolute certainty ; but far from disputing the reality of medicine as an art or science because it does not attain strict accuracy in all things, one ought to praise it because of its desire to approximate it and to admire it because from extreme ignorance it has proceeded to great discoveries well and rightly made, and not by chance.147 Diog. of Apollonia, fr. 1 : X?yov iraprbs ?pxopiepop ?oKe? pioi XPe&amp;v ^vaL tt]v ?pxyv avay.&lt;pia?r/rryrop irap?x^^Gai, rr/p ?? ep/ir/pelap airXr/p Kai ae/ipr/p.

I think not so ; but they are giving an exhibition of their own learning. To me it ap pears that to make a discovery, that were better made than left undis covered, is the desire and function of understanding, and to advance to completion that which is half-finished, likewise ; but to essay with ungentle words to shame the discoveries of others, oneself bettering nothing, but casting reproach upon the discoveries of those who know before those who do not know, this appears to me not the desire and function of understanding, but argues natural depravity even 149 more than want of science." Another interesting passage is the following : 15? " Medicine has long had an established principle and a method151 of its own invention, in accordance with which the many excellent discov eries were made in the long lapse of time and in accordance with which also the rest will be made, if one, having proper capacity and a knowl edge of past discoveries, shall take these as the point of departure for his quest. But whoso, casting these aside and rejecting all, shall essay to investigate after another method and in other fashion, and shall say that he has discovered aught, is deceived and deceives others ; for that is impossible." Elsewhere we are assured152 that the science of medi cine has nothing left it to discover, since it now teaches everything, characters as well as proper seasons. He who has learned its teachings will succeed with or without the favor of fortune.153 From this it will be seen that the ancient art or science of medicine had not only developed the spirit of science and formulated in general its ideals, but that in some minds it had attained to a position of such in dependence that it might lay claim to finality.

It was just this feeling of independence to which we attributed the growing sense of the autonomy of Nature that made it possible for philosophers to dispense with the intervention of the gods. The scien tific movement in philosophy and medicine runs parallel courses with constant interaction. How constant and important this reaction of one upon the other really was we can never know. In the present state of our knowledge it would be foolish even to attempt to say ; but that it is a fact, and a fact of large significance, none will deny. The physicians could not overlook the relation of the individual human organism to the world. They devoted themselves with keen intelligence to the study of atmospheric and climatic conditions 154 affecting the health of man, and in so doing could not avoid trenching on the domain of the physi cal philosopher. In countless other ways subjects of prime importance to the philosopher came within the purview of the writer on medicine. For all these questions the works of Hippocrates are for us an inex haustible source of information, though they rarely enable us to refer an opinion to its responsible author. It.is therefore a matter of interest to see the intimacy of the relation between these kindred disciplines recognized by the physicians. The Hippocratean treatise On Decorum155 sketches in ideal por traiture the man of science (especially the physician) and the philoso pher and contrasts with them the charlatan, who appears in the colors familiar to all in the Platonic portraits of the Sophists. There the physician is called a god-like philosopher,156 since he combines theory and practice of all that is true and beautiful. Philosopher and physi cian have the same virtues ; their differences are slight.157 Elsewhere, however, a distinction is drawn between the physician and the physical philosopher in respect to method. " There are those," we are told,158 " who have essayed to speak or write concerning medicine, basing their argument on the hot or the cold, on the moist or the dry or any thing 154 Cp. especially the treatise n. ??pcop, v?dr p, t?ttojp (2, 12 foil.

This is the more blameworthy, because they err touching an actual art which all men employ in the greatest emergencies and in which they honor most the skillful practitioners. Now there are prac titioners, some bad, some excellent ; which would not be true if medi cine were not actually an art, and no observations or discoveries had been made in it. All would be equally unskilled and ignorant of it, and the cure of diseases would be wholly subject to chance. As a matter of fact, it is not so ; but, as artisans in all other arts excel one the other in handicraft and knowledge, so also in medicine. Therefore I main tained that it had no need of vain hypotheses, as is the case in matters inaccessible to sense and open to doubt. Concerning these, if one es say to speak, one must resort to hypothesis. If, for example, one should speak and entertain an opinion touching things in the heavens or under the earth, it would be clear neither to the speaker nor to those who heard him whether his opinion was true or false ; for there is no appeal to aught that can establish the truth." While the resort to hypothesis in medicine is here denounced there are instances of such use in the works of Hippocrates, notably in Ilept &lt;?vow.159 One more passage160 relating to philosophy we may properly quote here. " Whoso is wont to hear men speak concerning the human con stitution beyond the range of its bearing upon medicine, will find the following discourse unprofitable ; for I do not say that man is wholly air, nor fire, nor water, nor earth, nor any thing else that is not clearly present in man. This I leave for whoso wills to say. Yet I think that those who say this are in error ; for they agree in point of view, but not in statement. Nevertheless the argument in support of their point of view is the same ; for they say that all that exists is one. This is the One and All ; but they give it different names. One calls the One and All air; another, fire; a third, water; still another, earth. And each supports his argument with proof and evidence, which amounts to nothing. For, seeing that they are all of one mind, but say, one man this thing, another that, it is clear that they have no knowledge of the 159 Littr? 6, 90 foil. The treatise is a Sophistic exercise, intended to prove that air, particularly the air in the body, is the cause of all diseases, and employs hypoth esis avowedly. Cp. c. 15 (p. 114 Littr?).

Of this one would be most thoroughly convinced if one at tended their disputations ; for when the self-same men dispute with one another in the presence of the self-same auditors, the same man never thrice in succession prevails in argument ; but now one prevails, now another, and again he who has the most flowing speech before the mob. Surely it is fair to demand that he who claims to have the right opinion about things should cause his argument always to pre vail, assuming that his opinion is true and that he properly sets it forth. As for me, I think that such men for want of understanding refute one another by the terms of their very argument and establish the contention of Melissus." If, now, we recall to mind those ideals and conceptions anticipated above in the first section of this study, we shall have a fair notion of science as it was conceived among the Greeks of the fifth century b. c. But we have still to inquire j ust what questions the scientist addressed to nature ; and to this quest we may now turn. Science essays to determine the facts and to explain them. The one thing depends upon the other. If you find a rock and ask what it is, it becomes necessary to discover whether it is in position or not. It proves to b? a boulder, and examination shows that it is metamorphic in character: finally it is identified as Laurentian, and.its presence here is explained by reference to glacial action. The definition of the fact involves the explanation; but explanation is the motive of the sci entific study of the fact, in contrast to the practical interest which leads merely to classification. The curious child, no less than the philoso pher, asks the question, Why*? But, while almost any answer, judi ciously framed, will satisfy the child, the philosopher knows that the question may receive very different answers according to its specific intention. To ask why is to demand an explanation ; and ' cause ' is our generic name for explanation. Different as individual attempts at explanation may be, they are reducible to a few kinds. We are famil iar with the four-fold causal principle of Aristotle, and with the,fact that, while recognizing four kinds of causation and insisting that in ex planation one should adduce all causes, he did not find it possible to reduce all to one, but was compelled to content himself in the ultimate analysis with two.161 This is, of course, not the place to discuss matters of metaphysics except so far as they pertain or contribute to our purpose ; but there is here a point of some interest for us. We have noted that of Aris totle's causes, the material points to the past. It is that which is 161 Cp. Ritter-Preller, ?? 395-396.</page><page sequence="43">HEIDEL. ? TlepX 4&gt;v&lt;T ws. 121 there to begin with. "In the beginning," says the materialist, "was matter." " No," replies the theist, " in the beginning God created matter ; " and thus a preface is placed before the beginning. The tele ologist and the pragmatic explain all with reference to the end, which justifies the means. All alike endeavor to define the fact in the hope of explaining it ; but it remained for a Socratic to detect the teleologi cal import of logical definition and hence practically to identify it with the final cause. We have referred to the principal classes of philoso phers with the exception of the positivist. If the materialist defines things with reference, so to speak, to the past, and the teleologist, with reference to the future, the positivist asks neither whence nor whither, but how. Definition for him becomes description, and description in universal, timeless terms. Such at least is the logic of his position. The reason why Aristotle did not find it possible to reconcile his ulti mately two-fold causation in his ' formal? cause is that historically he was the heir of the pre-Socratic and the Socratic methods, of which the former deified the material, the latter the final, cause.162 The degree of advancement in the formulation of the positivist attitude was not such as to compel a recognition in logic and metaphysics, although it would not be unfair to say that there was much of the pos itivist spirit in the scientific thought of the fifth century. Apparently it was the concreteness of Greek thinking, more than anything else, that obscured the significance of the scientific impulse as such. Every process, as we have seen, no matter how abstract, assumed in the thought of the Greeks the form of a series in time, or of a history with a proper beginning. How much of this was conscious device, how much instinctive procedure, we shall never know. Even the ideal con struction of the world in Plato's Timaeus was, however, taken as an intended vera historia by the literal-minded Aristotle. Accordingly we are not surprised to find that Aristotle sets down the pre-Socratics as mentioning only the material causes of things. This means, however, as we may now see, that they did not bring forward efficient causes ? that is, chiefly, God ? nor formal causes ? that is, definitions or descriptions ? nor final causes, as sufficient principles of explanation. It does not mean that they were not interested in the processes of nature as such or in their precise methods and laws. This no one would deny ; but it is a point of prime importance, whose significance is frequently overlooked. What Hippocrates says of the monists is true of them all. " They agree in point of view, but not in statement." Why the difference in language ? Because one kind of 162 The logical aspect of this situation I sought to set forth in my essay on The Necessary and the Contingent in the Aristotelian System.</page><page sequence="44">122 PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY. primal matter seemed to lend itself better than another to the explan ation of phenomena. The elements were interesting only as means to an end. It was the regularities of phenomena more than anything else that drew the attention of the philosopher ; presumably it was this aspect of nature which counted most strongly in favor of a single pri mary substance. But the tendency to simplify was indulged too far and led ultimately to the opposite extreme. Science, then, in attempting to explain things, assigns the cause and interprets the facts in accordance with analogies drawn from expe rience. In Hippocrates, II. &lt;j&gt;vo-wv, c. 15 we read : "Airs, then, have been shown to be most mischievous in all diseases : other causes are only accessory and ancillary, but this has been shown to be the real cause of diseases. I promised to declare the cause of diseases, and I have shown that wind (Tn/eS/xa) lords it over other things and particu larly over the bodies of living beings. I have applied the reasoning to known maladies, and in them the hypothesis has been shown to be true." " It is the function of the same intelligence to know the causes of diseases and to know how to treat them with all the resources of the art of healing."163 "What applies to the microcosm,164 is equally true of the cosmos. The causes must be sought everywhere ; for as Plato says,165 citing Hippocrates as his authority, one cannot know the nature of man without knowing the nature of the whole. We are accustomed to think that strict science, based upon the knowledge of causes, dates from the age of Plato and Aristotle, but such is not the case.166 In the Republic167 Plato suggests that in the effort to read 163 Hippocrates, n. r?x^ys, 11 (B, 20 Littr?). 164 The comparison is old (cp.

Of these we have an example in Hip pocrates, Ilcpt ?pxairjs IrjTpLKrj?. " Certain physicians and philosophers," he says,169 "assert that one cannot know the science of medicine without knowing what man is, how he origin-ally came into existence, and of what substances he was compounded in the beginning ; and this he who would properly treat men must be thoroughly cognizant of. Now the contention of these men really looks to philosophy, as do Empedocles and others who have written Hepl cf&gt;vo-eo)s. As for me, I consider that what a philosopher or physician has said or written Hep! &lt;j&gt;vo~eo)s has less relevancy to medicine than to painting ; and I am of opinion that, so far as concerns knowledge Repl cfavo-euc, one can know nothing definite about it except from medicine ; but this may be thor oughly learned when men go about it rightly. Hitherto, it seems to me, we are far from it : far, that is to say, from having a scientific knowledge of what man is (that is to say, what his constitution is), and to what causes he owes his origin and the rest, in any exact sense. Now so much at least it is indispensable that the physician should know Uepl Screws and should greatly concern himself to know, if he is to do any part of his duty ; to wit, what a man is (i. e. what his con stitution is) relative to meat and drink, and what he is relative to the rest of his mode of life, and what results follow for the individual from particular things, and all this not merely in general terms, as e. g., ' cheese is unwholesome food, for it distresses one who eats plentifully of it ' ; but what particular distress it causes, and for what reason, and to what ingredient of the man's constitution it is unsuitable. " The 168 Cp. also the myth in Plato's Protagoras, 320 C foil., where the virtues are illustrated by the story of their origin. An interesting contrast is presented by Aristotle, De Gener. Animal. 778a 16 foil., where he discusses the cases in which biological phenomena are to be interpreted ideologically or physically ; y?peais is for the sake of ovala, and ovala is the cause of y?peais. The ancient physiologers thought otherwise ; hence they recognized only material and efficient causes, not even discrim inating between them. He states his own view thus : ov ?i? rb ylyveadai e mar op iroi?p ri, ?i? rovro iroi?p ri ?ar'ip, oaa reray/x?pa Kai wpiapi?pa ?pya rrjs (p?ae?s ?arip, ?XX? pi?XXov ?i? rb e?pai roia?i ylyperai roiavra. The opposite argument is presented in Plato, Euthyphro, 10 A foil. The latter clearly represents the common logical procedure, based upon the common usage of the Greeks as established in the pre Socratic period, though, strictly speaking, the former conforms perfectly to the teleo logical logic of the Socratics. This is another illustration of the inner contradiction of the Aristotelian logic. 169 C. 20 (1, p. 24 K?hlewein).</page><page sequence="46">124 PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY. writer then proceeds to say that the physician must study the particu lar food-stuff and its physiological action as well as the individual con stitution, determining which of the humors is irXelw ?ve?v Kal fxaWov evhwaorrevw lv tw o-ufxaTi, and then knowing which humor is inimical170 to the particular food-stuff and is roused to hostility by it, he can pre scribe a suitable diet. Here we find set up an ideal that science is still far from realizing. Only a year or two ago an eminent physician stated that the specific physiological action of drugs still remained undiscovered, with the possible exception of two or three. Even for foods a bare beginning has been made. We may recall that Hippocrates elsewhere171 insists that each phenomenon has its own &lt;??&lt;r?s or natural cause (law 1) and that Heraclitus likewise proposed to explain each thing according to its own law, thus aspiring to meet the two-fold requirement of science which aims to discover both the proximate causes of events and the ultimate statement of universal law. There is, moreover, a further interest attaching to the passage just quoted at length. It formulates three questions raised by philosophers and by physicians philosophi cally inclined: (1) what man is; (2) how he originated; and (3) of what he is composed. The first and third questions, as we have seen, practically coincide ; the second agrees with its fellows, except that it regards the process rather than the result, which is, however, only an analysis read backward and cast into the time-form. Hippocrates does not object to the questions, as such; he merely regards them as too general and, therefore, as premature, considering the stage of advance ment attained by positive science in his time. His attitude is instruc tive, however, since it is obviously that of a scientist of knowledge and discernment looking with critical eye upon the venturesome undertak ings of less mature minds ; for science naturally proceeds from the gen eral to the particular.172 The same position is taken in the essay Ilcpt ?Wt^?: 173 " I say that one 170 In the microcosm we thus have a picture in miniature of the cosmic ir?Xe/uLos of elemental forces, in which one element prevails (eVt/c/oaret) at one time, a second at another. It is the function of the physician to support (?orjdeip) the losing ele ment and so to restore the harmony of a proper balance of powers. Cp., for example, n. ieprjs po?aov, 18 (6, 394 foil.

Unless he knows his original composition, he will not be able to know the results that flow from it; unless he distinguish174 the ruling constituent in the body, he will not be capable of administering what is beneficial to the man. This, then, the writer must know ; but he must have learned, in addi tion, the action ? whether due to nature or to human constraint and art ? that each kind of meat and drink has which we employ by way of diet." To these, or similar, words of Hippocrates Plato refers in the Phaedrus175 with cordial approval. It thus becomes a common place that distinction and, above all, analysis of a complex whole into its parts, are necessary to clear philosophical thought ;176 and that, in order to make clear the nature of anything, it is desirable by an act of imaginative synthesis to reconstitute the fact thus analyzed. The boy who takes his watch to pieces and tries to put it together again, ? usually with scant success, because synthesis lags far be hind analysis, ? indulges an ideal, rather than a practical, instinct. He has no thought of making watches, but wants to understand his time-piece. At the beginning of the Politics177 Aristotle puts the matter clearly : " As in other departments of science, so in politics, the compound should always be resolved into the simple elements or least parts of the whole. We must therefore look at the elements of which the state is composed. ...

Quite apart from the obvious debt of Aristotle in this matter to Plato 178 and Hippocrates, it must be clear that this method of procedure has no relevancy to the distinct ively Socratic doctrine of definition in terms of the end or purpose ; it is a survival from the naturalistic or mechanical mode of thought, de veloped in the pre-Socratic age, which explains things in terms of their origin and physical constituents. Socrates, the originator of the teleological method, could not under stand this procedure. To his mind it belonged not to theory, but to the sphere of the practical arts. There is an extremely interesting passage touching this matter in Xenophon's Memorabilia.11* "Nor did he (Socrates) converse," we are told, "about the constitution of the world (jrepl t?)? iw iravTi?v &lt;?vo- a&gt;?), as the majority of the philoso phers do, inquiring how that which the philosophers call the cosmos originated 180 and by what mechanical forces 181 (amy/catc) the phe nomena of the heavens are brought about, but he even declared that they who worry their heads about such matters are fools." ..." He inquired also concerning the philosophers, asking whether, in like man ner as they who learn the human arts 182 think that they shall be able to make what they may learn either for themselves or for whomsoever they please, so also they who study things divine think that when they have learned by what mechanical forces they severally come about, they shall at their pleasure make winds and rains 183 and whatever of the 178 Especially Repub. 368 D foil., Phaedr. 270 C foil.

The difference between the physical and the teleological points of view is beautifully illustrated by the story told by Plutarch in his Life of Per icles : 184 " It is related that on a certain occasion the head of a goat with a single horn was brought from the country to Pericles, and that Lamp?n, the seer, when he saw the strong, solid horn growing out of the middle of the forehead, said that, there being in the city two rivals for power, Thucydides and Pericles, the power would come to the one to whom the sign was given. Anaxagoras, however, cutting open the skull, showed that the brain was not fully developed at the base, but shrunken from its integument and coming somewhat to a point, egg like, af the spot where the horn sprouted. At the time Anaxagoras was applauded by those who were present ; but Lampon's turn came shortly afterwards, when the power of Thucydides was broken and the affairs of the people came steadily under the direction of Pericles. There was nothing, however, so far as I can see, in the way of the phy sical philosopher and the seer 186 being equally in the right, the one State of his poem we are not in position to judge. The promise of fr. 2 is sufficiently modest (cp. Parmenides, fr. 10 and 11). I incline to think that fr. Ill belongs to the concluding passage of his philosophical poem, and voices the high hopes of the author that the secrets of nature will soon be laid bare. The age of Empedocles was intoxicated with the new wine of science and regarded nothing as too difficult to explain. Once the principles were fully understood, as in certain sciences (e.g. medicine, as we have seen) they were by some even then thought to be, it was not strange that men should hope to perform wonders of science equal to the most ambitious miracles of magic. 184 0. 6. 185 It is certain that the Socratic teleology, whether suggested by Socrates' reverence for p.apriK-f) or not, came to the rescue of divination at a time when it was in a bad way, as we may see from Thucydides. The identity of the two points of view is apparent: the question remains whether teleology is immanent in the process of nature or imposed on it from without. In a way piapriKr) differs from iaroplrj chiefly in this that the latter attempts to know the present by reconstructing the past, while the former seeks to infer the future from the present.

Democritus is reported to have said that he would rather make one contribution to the causal explanation of things than be made King of the Persians.186 Surely this does not mean that he wanted to discover an atom ; he was in search of the causal nexus in whatever form, and his atoms and void were only the last link in the chain. Men knew what it meant to explain : they did not confuse explanation with de scription, although they might content themselves with the latter, in default of the former. This was often the attitude of the physician, aware of his ignorance of the real cause. The words of Thucydides about the great plague well illustrate this point. " As to its probable origin," he says,187 "or the causes which might or could have produced such a disturbance of nature, every man, whether a physician or not, may give his own opinion. But I shall describe its actual course, and the symptoms by which any one who knows them beforehand may xecognize the disorder should it ever reappear." It would be easy to multiply witnesses proving that the pre-Socratic philosophers aimed at nothing short of a complete understanding of the world in terms of its physical causes ; but enough has been said. There is, however, one passage in Plato to which reference should be made. In the Phaedo 188 Socrates sets forth, as only Plato could do it, the difference in point of view between the Socratic and the pre-Socratic philosophies. No contrast could be more clearly or sharply drawn : on the one hand we find an explanation of things beginning with matter and operating with mechanical causes, for which Socrates declares him self by nature unfitted ; on the other stands the teleological conception of the world for which Socrates is sponsor. Socrates tells how eagerly he took up the book of Anaxagoras in the hope of finding a real antici pation of his view, but only to meet with utter disappointment. Plato does not often touch directly upon the earlier philosophies, but here he has drawn a picture of their aims and methods which leaves nothing to be desired. Perhaps its full significance is hardly realized. ?6 Fr. 118. 187 il. 48, 3, transi. Jowett.

Certainly it would not be true to say even of the Ioni ans that they restricted themselves to the question as to the primary substance of the world. Nature (and cj&gt;vo-is) meant more than this : it included the law or process of growth exemplified in all things. Aris totle and Theophrastus suggest that Thaies was led to the assumption that water was the primary substance by observations connected with evaporation and precipitation ; be that as it may, it is certain that his successor Anaximander was more interested in the cosmic process of seg regation than in his colorless Infinite, and thenceforward cosmic pro cesses and laws occupy the attention of philosophers more and more. The main sense of Nature was, however, the sum of things as consti tuted by the elements and the cosmic laws and processes. This it was, the Natura Herum, to the understanding of which the philosopher im mediately addressed himself; and it was in this sense that the term &lt;?vo-i? occurs in the titular phrase Hepl ^uo-ew?. Yet, as we have seen, while the inquiry or lo-TopL-q irepl f?o-eus concerned the question ' what is it ' (o TL coti), the answer at once carried the inquirer to the further ques tions ' of what is it constituted ' and 'how did it come about/ There is nothing startling in this conclusion. It is just what we might have expected, knowing the operations of the human mind. It is, however, not without a certain interest that we thus discover the ideals of pres ent-day science informing and impelling the fathers of all science. Science, however, merely formulates in the hierarchy of its ideals the interests of the plain man who goes about his daily business with no particular predilection for matters theoretical. The common mind is chiefly concerned with results, neither asking nor greatly caring how they were obtained. As for the underlying causes, material or efficient, which produced the results, they are relatively unimportant, except for the purpose of attaining the same object either actually or by way of ideal construction or verification. Thus every one has heard of the latest invention, say the aeroplane, and accepts it as a fact of interest. Many, though by no means all, know the names of the inventors ; the human interest in personalities of distinction contributes not a little to the attitude of mind which fixes attention upon the author. Even smaller is the number of those who know of what materials the machine is constructed. That is a question of importance chiefly to the practical experimenter. Fewest of all are those who concern themselves about VOL.

Many an experimenter even will be found to be lacking in a knowledge of these principles which absorb the attention of the theorist. The natural philosopher, however, will devote himself to the determination and for mulation of the laws involved ; from his point of view the inventor is of no consequence, and in his calculations the materials used in the contrivance will figure as a plus or minus quantity. It remains for us to speak briefly of Professor Burnet's dictum189 concerning the scope of the early Greek researches Hep! &lt;?&gt;vo-cm. Since he himself holds that the title is not original and finds it first men tioned in Euripides,190 it is fair to judge it by the conceptions of the fifth century. But we may reasonably go farther and assert that the usage of the fifth"and fourth centuries b.c. merely reflects the ideals of Greek science as they were gradually developed from the beginning. In the Metaphysics191 Aristotle says : * It is owing to their wonder that men both now begin and at first began to philosophize ; they won dered originally at the obvious difficulties, then advanced little by little and stated difficulties about the greater matters, e. g. about the phe nomena of the moon and those of the sun, and about the stars and about the genesis of the universe/' It is clear that the "obvious diffi culties, " which are said to have originally excited the wonder of men, belong rather to the stages of preparation for technical philosophy, and that philosophy proper begins for Aristotle with the investigation of the phenomena of the heavens and of the origin of the universe. Accord ing to Plato192 also it was the observed regularities of heavenly phe nomena that begot the research into the nature of the universe. They were the Oe?a par excellence,1** and wonder born of the observation of them was supposed to have produced the belief in the existence of gods.194 It can hardly be doubted that in the early stages of philoso phy the researches of investigators might have been almost indifferently characterized as irepi fjuertiop^v or irepi (pvo-eoys ?o-Top?rj.

In the Hippocratean treatise liepl o-apK?v occurs an instruc tive passage. "Concerning r? /xerewpa," we read,197 "I do not want to speak except to show, in regard to man and the other animals, how they came about in the,course of nature, and what the soul is, what is health and disease, what it is that produces health and disease in man, and from what cause he dies." The author, while professing to speak irepi tu)v fierewpiuv, proceeds to sketch the origin of things, giving in fact a miniature discourse Uepl ^vo-em after the manner of the philosophers, in the course of which he describes the segregation of the cosmic ele ments and then turns abruptly to tell of the origin of the various parts of the human organism. Each subject is introduced with the laconic but significant phrase, ?SSc ?yeWo.198 We are thus brought face to face with the second sphere of interest included in the researches of early philosophy ; for, however much the cosmos engaged the attention of the investigator, the microcosm soon, if not immediately, made good its claims. We have repeatedly re marked upon the intimate connexion of medicine, so far as it con cerned physiology, with inquiries irepi &lt;/&gt;vct &lt;d?. We need not now enlarge upon this theme. It is sufficient to call attention to the fact that it was recognized by Aristotle199 as well as by the pre-Socratics. But while the philosopher may have devoted the greater part of his attention to these two fields, nothing lay outside the sphere of his in terest. Thus it is not improbable that the study of mathematics was associated with philosophy from the beginning and included in the scope of ?lepl &lt;?vo-c?)? {(TTop?rj. Aristotle, whose empirical method of determining what does and what does not belong to the subject matter of the several sciences is well known, says in the Metaphysics : 20? 196 See Gilbert, Die meteorol.

And for this rea son no one who is conducting a special inquiry tries to say anything about their truth or falsehood, ? neither the geometer nor the arithme tician.

IIcpl 4&gt;v&lt;T ?&gt;$. 133 cj&gt;vo-e(?s io-Topia was set in sharp contrast206 to the ethical and method ological studies of Socrates which resulted in the logic and metaphysics of Plato and Aristotle. It is not surprising that science, sprung from the bosom of religion, and fostered by a spirit of reverence for truth in an age when the crumbling ruins of ancient beliefs testified to a loss of respect for the traditional gods, should have become in a measure itself a religion. Attention was called above to the fact that the philosophical system became in time invested with sanctity and was handed down as a ?ep?? ?oyo?. In the Greek mysteries, even in the fifth century, and possibly in the sixth, ?iroirreia, the final stage of initiation, included a vision of that most divine spectacle, the stellar universe. In Orphic and Py thagorean conventicles there was undoubtedly some consideration of its meaning, though one cannot say how much. Much nonsense is reported of the secrets of the Pythagoreans, but it probably had some basis in fact. The religion of the time tended more and more to be come a matter of the individual, though the public forms were ob served. Science, competing with religion and in educated circles to a considerable extent supplanting it, naturally appropriated its forms. The "Law" of Hippocrates 207 ends thus : "Things holy are revealed to holy men ; to the profane it is forbidden, before they are initiated into the Mysteries of science." We are familiar with the beatitude pronounced by the poets upon those who were initiated in the Myste ries of Eleusis,208 for they should see the gods and dwell with them, released from the distressing cycle of birth and death. Not unlike it is the inspired utterance of Euripides 209 in praise of the philosopher of nature : " Blessed is he who hath got knowledge of science, bent neither on harm to his neighbors nor on ways of injustice ; but, con templating the ageless order of undying nature, knoweth what it is and how. To such men there never cleaves desire for deeds of shame."
