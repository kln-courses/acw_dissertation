Chicago: Aldine-Atherton, 1972. vii + 174 pp., maps, tables, 2 appendices, appendix bibliography, further reading, index. $7.50 (cloth), $2.95 (paper). Reviewed by MICHAEL MOERMAN University of California, Los Angeles This book has two parts, and each part has four chapters. The first chapter describes the physical and demographic aspects of Bang Chan, once a village and now an industrialized suburb in Central Thailand, and compares it with places more familiar to American undergraduates in such a way that life there retains its peculiar local character, but without exotic preciousness. The second and third chapters display an elegant com- mand of the history and biology of rice expressed in properly (because of the use of native metaphor) anthropomorphic terms. They are a strong and lovely evocation of the vast and impersonal forces that make plants and soil. With no loss of the sense of complicated interrelationships, Hanks cuts through masses of detailed knowledge. The concluding chapter of this part both defines his critical ecological concept, "the hold- ing," and provides pithy expression of the knowledge and perceptions of farmers. It also attempts, not too successfully I think, to formalize and quantify the energy ex- changes of various rice-farming holdings. The book's second half traces the history of Bang Chan as it changed from a settle- ment of pioneering "shifting cultivators" to broadcasters, transplanters, and finally oc- casional farmers. Its model of adaptation is quite interesting. The basic adaptive unit is the household. It preserves the integrity of its functions by using constant principles of recruitment (essentially of conscious reci- procity) so that changing circumstances oc- casion the inclusion of different personnel. Of more immediate relevance to ecology, altered types of agricultural production are viewed as the consequences of decisions about production made by households pur- suing their own integrity. This perhaps jus- tifies what would otherwise be solely a fault. Each historical period, "shifting cultiva- tion," "broadcasting," and "transplanting," is used merely as a title of a chapter, with little effort made to trace the relationships between a given form of farming and the social descriptions (e.g., of government, reli- gion, kinship, etc.) presented in that chapter. The consequence, of course, is to assume in advance the conclusion: that the social institutions are adaptations to the form of production. There was a time-between its recording customs and its pursuit of problems, lexi-</page><page sequence="2">ETHNOLOGY 439 cons, and things to be counted-when eth- nography was concerned with people, with how the culturally mediated world impinged upon and was transformed by the percep- tions, goals, feelings, and aspirations of recognizably human beings. Ethnography was then an heroic, humane, and very personal enterprise-an art, not a craft. Its tools were the ethnographer's character and responsiveness that made natives open and truthful, the empathy that permitted under- standing, the cultivation of mind that en- abled him to see implications for humanity, the alert sensitivity that captured isolated moments as illustrations of underlying pat- terns and historical processes, and his liter- ary genius for synthesizing and conveying what he had learned and understood. The gifts were those of the novelist, but the product was different because it focused on general social and biological forces as the constraints upon and resources for the in- dividual destinies they thus explained. This book represents that golden age of ethnog- raphy; its author commands those tools. I commend it to you for both its flaws, which would distort this brief review to dwell on, and its accomplishments.</page></plain_text>
