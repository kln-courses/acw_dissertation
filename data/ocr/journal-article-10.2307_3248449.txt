Among the ideas that shaped it, how- ever, the function of the cave must have been defined in a more general way. The natural human reaction to a cave is a vague, instinctive uneasiness.

In the Iranian legends, the cave is associated with the Enemy as a place of darkness and terror. Such was the home of Franrasyan, the Turanian villain of the Avesta.'23 The modernized enemy of the Shah Nameb, Afrasiab, flees to a great underground palace after his final defeat."'2 It is in the depths of the earth that Rustam meets and kills one of his most terrible antagonists, the gigantic White Fiend of Mazanda- ran."25 The motif, a sort of reverse evaluation of the myth of the Sleeping Hero, is so ancient that it may be traced in the earliest Indo-aryan memories as well. Ahi, the enemy of Indra, 122 Beal, Buddhist Records, II, pp. 156 (a cavern the home of Asuras; from it emerge fearful creatures); 225-227 (the Master of Sastras who dared to enter an Asuras' palace in a mountain to await the coming of Maitreya). Vogel, op. cit., pp. 61 ff. (the disciple of the Brahman Veda who was ordered by his master to pursue a Naga; and followed it through a hole into an underground paradise, from which he escaped only with difficulty). Stein, Kal/zana 's Chronicle, I, pp. 107 ff. (the king who dared to push into a fearful cave past deadly bees, to see a goddess). For earlier references in the Vedic literature to the abode of Evil as an abyss of darkness beneath the earth, see W. N. Brown, "The Rigvedic Equivalent for Hell", your. Am. Or. Soc., LXI, 2, 1941, pp. 76 ff.; and "The Creation Myth of the Rig Veda", ibid., LXII, 2, 1942, pp. 85 ff. 123 Yast V of the Avesta, celebrating the goddess Anahita, tells how she was sacrificed to by "the Turanian murderer, Frangrasyan... in his cave under the earth"; so Darmesteter, SBE, XXIII, p. 64. The "Bundahis", XII, verse 20, locates this underground stronghold in "the Bakyir mountain" (West, SBE, V, p. 38). The Avestan Yast XV, v, locates the lair of "the three-mouthed Azi Dahaka" in a place that Darmesteter (op. cit., p. 263) makes "an accursed palace"; but that Herzfeld, "Zarathustra", p. 165, interprets as "ursprtinglich der kosmischen Drachenhohle". 121 See the Warners' SheTknamna, IV, pp. 259 ff.; and Darmesteter, op. cit., p. 64, note 2. It is a curious proof of the stubborn longevity of Indo-iranian legends that Afrasiab is taken prisoner in his cavern by the hermit Hum: the modernized descendant of Haoma or Soma, the sacred drink, who in Vedic literature as well is personified and made to share in the slaying of the primeval dragon. Odd also is the possibility that the legendary Kaniska may have been introduced into this story cycle as well. The mid 9th century miscellany Yu Yang Tsa Tsu g 1 4f gJ XV, repeats (probably from some returned traveller to India) a story of his war against the South Indian king Salivahana. When his army proved irresistible, the latter's subjects hid him in a cavern, and made in his stead a gold portrait statue that they throned, insisting to the conqueror that they had no other ruler. 125 Skanahma translation, II, pp. 59 ff. Herzfeld, Zoroaster, II, p. 716. 64</page><page sequence="3">"is full of wiles, betakes himself to the mountains, hides in caves, lies enfolded by the waters.'26 On the other hand, the cave is an attribute of the greatest importance to the Buddha image in Gandhdra, Central Asia, and China. Even more remarkable, it is within the shadows of a cave that sunny Mithra slaughters the bull, by an act whose meaning is very different from the smashing of the dragon of darkness. What. is it that makes this difference possible ? It is a commonplace that the religious development of India and the Near East in the last half millennium before Christ, in an age when growing insistence on personal needs led at last to the emergence of savior cults everywhere, brought a revolution among the gods. As the official deities, the Athenas and Indras, became obsolete, they were in part replaced by darker powers: beings like Rudra-Siva and Dionysos, who had perhaps existed in superstition since the Stone Age, who were more ancient than the oldest ethical system, and who in some respects, therefore, were not too clearly distinguishable from devils. Even the high gods who survived, like Mithra, paid for the privilege by undergoing a strange transformation. It was no longer enough to ride a golden chariot across the sky, to kill dragons, to speak in the thunder. The supreme god had now to submit to experiences that were not wholly new, but that in the past had been required of only a few special deities, as part of the de- finition of their natures. As the sun had been imagined a prisoner of night, or as the Corn- god had died annually, so the savior and lord of all had now to submit his radiance to shadows, to be born in human form, sometimes to suffer and die. In the process by which he became more widely loved, he might lose much of his old individuality in exchange for more universal attributes. The Mithra worshipped in the Roman world was a very different figure from the simple light-dispelling-dark of Iranian tradition. He too had been born among men, not merely upon but out of the earth, and only at the end had returned to heaven. The religious values in his story, no longer obviously heroic, were even misleadingly veiled. In orthodox Persian teaching, the ox is the first companion of man in Ahura Mazda's creation. It is the wanton slaughter of the ox by the Arch-fiend that begins the rule of darkness and evil on earth.'27 To preach as the means of human salvation a sun-god who became a man, who slew a bull in darkness that out of death might come life, must have been the extreme of blasphemy in the Zoroastrian sense. Within the Mystery it was possible 126 Rajavade, "Indra's Enemies" p. 232. 127 West, translation of the "Bundahis", III, pp. 15-20. 65</page><page sequence="4">for the initiate to transform grossness and violence into solemn beauty and hope. To the Sasanian Magi who fought so obstinately to restore the purity of Iranian religion, nothing could have been perceptible but a peculiarly shocking heresy. It is not hard to imagine how they would have flayed its founder like Mani if they had been able to find him. The religious environment out of which the Mithra cult grew was of course not merely a phenomenon of the Roman empire, or excluded from Persia by being different from Zoroastrian orthodoxy. It flourished all over the ancient Orient, sometimes sprouting forms of the crudest sensuality and sometimes flowering into reverent speculation or the purest love. Everywhere it was intricate and confused, a puzzling juxtaposition of lights and darks. Its most elaborate growth was the Gnostic system. By the Roman imperial age, Gnostic strains were perceptible in all the higher Near Eastern Mysteries. They were so dangerous in Christianity that much of the energy of the early church was channeled into defense against them. Widespread in central Persia, they furnished the intellectual inheritance of Mani in the third century. I believe that it was an eastward penetration of ideas that may broadly be called Gnostic that explains the prominence of the cave theme in Kushan Buddhism. Gnostic belief exploited the ancient Iranian dualism to an even stranger end than that reached by the sun-god Mithra. The Zoroastrian opposition was a clear-cut symmetry, balancing Light and Goodness on one side against Darkness and Evil on the other. All forms of life entered the combat as auxiliaries, even the animals being divided between Ahura and the Fiend; the sensible world was the battlefield.'28 Gnosticism injected a complication born of the immense disgust for life of a pessimistic age: the conviction that dualism must extend to an opposition of spirit and matter. In this new war, the lines were no longer regular. The enemy was everywhere, even within the fighter himself. The issues were so tangled that it was not clear whether Creation had been a work of supreme Goodness or of supreme Evil. Nothing was certain except the desperate complexity of the present. The only hope lay in the fact that if Evil were omnipresent in the material world, so also was Goodness in some redeeming measure. It was the work of Gnosis somehow to free the light of the spirit from its encumbrance of Evil, and so permit it to rejoin the source of all light. 128 Darmesteter, SBE, IV, pp. lxxii-lxxiii. 66</page><page sequence="5">The Gnostic philosophy explained the creation and present plight of the world by some sort of descent of the divine spirit from its sphere of absolute purity, into lower regions where it had interacted with the opposing forces of darkness. As the allegorical framework of a religion, the premise insisted on the presence of the god in this world. To emphasize the depth of his involvement, it might demand not merely that he be born of a human mother, but that he come from the earth itself, as representing matter most completely. So Mithra emerged from a rock before the shepherds as witnesses, and lived in a cave; "' and 129 I have found a number of scattered references to caves within the Iranian cultural sphere that seem to have possessed a more or less closely related religious significance. The geographical section of the Chinese history of the T'ang dynasty, Tcang Shu, CCXXI, mentions in the envrions of a city of the Eastern Ts'ao f~f (in present Russian Turkestan) "a great cavern to which entry is barred. Sacrifices are offered there twice yearly. Men stand facing the cave; a fire emerges; and he whom it first touches, dies". So Chavannes in Documents sur les Tou-kiue (Turcs) occidentaux, Paris, n. d., p. 138. Ibid., pp. 155 ff., quotes from the same source a description of ancient Tokharestan, the former Bactria. In the realm is a mountain "on the south side of which is a divine horse in a cavern. The people of the land pasture their mares nearby; the latter drop foals that have the peculiarity of sweating blood ". The possible connotations of this cult may be suggested by evidence from various sources. Coins from that general region show an unusual preference for the head of a horse as a reverse design in place of the figure of an anthropo- morphic god; see A. de la Fuye, "Monnaies... de la Sogdiane", pp. 48, 145. The identification of the sun with a horse as symbol is a commonplace of Indo-aryan belief; e. g. in Brahmanical ritual the procession may be led by a white horse standing for the sun, as a means of dispelling evil influences. See J. Eggeling's translation of The Satapatha Brahmana, III, in SBE. XLI, Oxford, 1894, p. 357. A chapter of Howey's Horse shows the wide diffusion of this idea throughout Europe and Western Asia. In Iranian mythology the god Tishtrya takes the form of a white horse in his terrible duel with the drought demon Apaosha (SBE, XXIII, p. 99), an allegory of the opposition of life-giving and death-dealing forces in Nature. Stein in Old Routes of Western Iran, London, 1940, pp. 324 ff., describes the "Caves of Karafto" as a complex natural grotto adapted for cult purposes. Inside are many graffiti of horses, with or without riders; at the front a Greek inscription reads, "Here resides Herakles; nothing evil may enter". He brings in Tacitus' account of a Roman campaign against the Arsacid King Gotarzes, where what he believes to be the same sanctuary is mentioned: the abode of a local "Hercules" who would emerge at night to hunt on horses furnished by his priests. Stein notes that it is the Persian god of victory, Verethragna, who is usually equated to Herakles; but suggests that the prominence of the horse theme at Karafto may point rather to Mithra, so frequently represented as a mounted hunter. Chavannes, op. cit., pp. 71, 201, quotes from Yu Yang Tsa Tszu, the description of a Mazdean shrine in the realm of Kawadhidjan on a northern tributary of the Oxus. The god, who had come there miraculously from Persia, had no image. In the building there were only large and small fire altars and "a horse of bronze, the size of a pony, that the inhabitants claim 67</page><page sequence="6">so Jesus, in the Eastern Apocrypha, was born in a cave in Bethlehem. In at least one Gnostic version of the story of Christ, again, at the Crucifixion when the body hung painfully on the cross, the divinity that had withdrawn itself was symbolically shadowed by taking refuge in a cave. The Resurrection, as a second birth, meant necessarily a breaking from a sepulchre in the earth.'30 descended from heaven. It is in a rearing position, with its front legs in the air, facing the god. Its rear legs are in the ground; from time to time attempts have been made to dig down to its hooves, but even at a depth of several hundreds of feet these have failed... On every New Year's Day a horse of a golden color emerges from the river, whinnies to the bronze horse and is answered, and then goes back into the water again. In recent years an Arab prince, an unbeliever, entered the fire shrine with the intention of demolishing it. Suddenly a fire flared up and consumed his soldiers; so that he never again dared to offer it any harm". Here, where a strict Zoroastrian orthodoxy seems to have prohibited any representation of the god in human form, his surrogate seems to have been the horse; who by the Gnostic formula was imagined both as having come down from the sky, and as being involved in earth to a degree beyond human comprehension. In the official cult of the Sasanian regime, note the unique mortuary cave of Shahpur I, containing his colossal portrait statue (Herzfeld, Iran, p. 320); and his inscription referring to a ceremony in which he shot arrows out of a cave (E. g. Browne, A Literary History of Persia, New York, 1902, pp. 151-152). 130 For the birth of Jesus see James, Apocryphal New Testament, pp. 46, 74, 8o. The simultaneous presence in a cave on the Mount of Olives and on the cross is told in the "Acts of John", p. 254. In the latter half of Trabucco's Porphyre, see P. Saintyves," "Les grottes dans les cultes magico-religieux", etc., especially for the remarkable development of caverns as Christian pilgrimage sites in the Holy Land (continuing earlier subterranean rites in honor of Adonis, Astarte, etc.). Rowland, "A Nativity Panel, with a Note on the Iconography of the Cave", Bull. of the W. H. Fogg Art Mus., VIII, 2, 1939, pp. 59-65, applies similar ideas to explain the iconographic background of an Italo-byzantine panel painting. Interpretation of the cave theme must have taken widely different directions in different religious environments. My thesis regarding the birth of Jesus from the earth is that it was a necessary result of the Gnostic concept of spirit penetrating the corruption of matter. The instance cited by Rowland, p. 65 note 21, from the "Proto- evangelion", XXII (James, p. 48), in which Elizabeth, fleeing with the baby John from Herod's massacre, calls on "the mountain of God" to receive her; whereupon "the mountain clave asunder and took her in"; seems to me to represent quite a different order of ideas. The Earth there is an ally of the right side, as it appears in the Buddha's temptation by Maira, or in the ancient Vedic myths that seem to make a female Earth personification the mother of the champion Indra (Brown, "Creation Myth" pp. 92-93). The moral is the same as that in the Shi'ite story cited by Herzfeld, Zoroaster, II, p. 715: in which the Earth-goddess, pursued by Azi Dahaka, finds refuge inside the rock of a grotto. For another divine birth in a cave, that of Dionysos in the midst of lightning flames, see the description of Philostratos, Imagines, I, 14 (translation by A. Fairbanks in Loeb Clas. Lib., 1931, p. 59). 68</page><page sequence="7">From this deepest penetration of spirit into matter came by allegory the promise that no human being should be entirely beyond redemption. It must have been to insist on this by drawing the ritual parallel as close as possible that the followers of Mithra met in cave-like sanctuaries, designed to present the universe in microcosm. Porphyry wrote of the Mithraic sanctuary known to the Roman world in the second and third centuries. His description might with almost equal aptness be applied to the Buddhist cave shrine of Chinese Turkestan, between the fifth and seventh centuries (fig. 5). There it is the painted decoration that completes the model of the world: the environment of mankind on the lower walls, fabulous mountains above, the firmament Fig. 5 Buddhist Cave-chapel, Simsim 6- 7 th Centuries A. D. (?) with its powers at the summit of the vault.'31 In the Kucha Style, also, the cave cut from the rock must be "a symbol of that matter of which the World consists", gloomy, heavy, formless, permeated by Evil. The Buddha image inside, half enclosed by stone, is surrounded by a great, flaming, particolored aureole, a sunburst of light. The symbolism is much more explicit than in the Shadow Cave or the "Visit" stelae. Its completeness may be the result both of a later date and a more intensive exposure to Iranian beliefs: perhaps even an ex- posure to the Manichaean system, which was spreading into Central Asia at the time with almost as much success as Buddhism (and as we have seen was capable of combining with Buddhist beliefs to form strange new compounds). If the Kucha caves provide the final, unequivocal statement, they merely elaborate what had already been clear in the second century. The Chinese hymn of praise to Hui-yiian's copy 131 As strictly as is possible in a rectangular room, with a major interruption in the cult icon at the rear 69</page><page sequence="8">of the Shadow Cave stresses again and again the theme of a great light in the midst of darkness. The Gandharan sculptors of the "Visit" stelae may show about the Buddha figure conventionalized flames licking out around the mouth of the cavern (fig.4). In this they clearly illustrate as well as they can the detail of the story (apparently peculiar to its telling in the Northwest) which insists that as the host of Indra drew near, the Buddha entered the "flaming ecstasy", so that the whole mountain that enclosed him turned the color of fire.'32 Sculpture is inadequate at best before such a miracle. In one stele, therefore, the picturesque narrative realism of the imperial Kushan style in Gandhara is reinforced by an emphatic symbol (fig. 4). Among the birds and animals that crowd the mountainside, one here is signalled out by its place, just above the top of the cave mouth and over the Buddha's head. It is a peacock with a spread tail. On either side of the bird is a monkey, squatting in the yoga pose. The intention is apparently a double one, first to suggest in non-human terms the familiar framing of the Buddha by the figures of meditating monks;'33 then to equate the anthropomorphic Lord with the peacock, and so through its fanning tail with the sun. The combination seems to be a subtler variant of the juxtaposition of Buddha and Mithra-Helios at Bdmiydn. Here also the Central Asian cave shrines pick up and develop the theme; for in the "PfauenhBhle" at Qyzyl the whole domical ceiling, crowned by the Buddhist lotus, is developed below as a great stylized peacock's tail, with sixteen sectors.31 In the Gandhdran stelae, therefore, the clear purpose is to present, in a symbolic language colored by Gnosticism, the statement that the Buddha is the Savior of the World. With the special setting of Indra's visit, the claim is made as a kind of Buddhist Adoration of the Magi, (staged around a cave like the Epiphany in Byzantine art). and a minor one above the doorway, the shrine seems to present the Iranian cosmological premise of a world ringed about by the fabulous mountain chain of Hara Berezaiti, with the celestial vault resting on its rim: see ibid., pp. 688 ff. 132 I disagree here with Coomaraswamy, "Early Indian Iconography, I: Indra", p. 39, who ascribes the flaming of the mountain in all versions to the coming of the gods. The version of the stele from Loriyan- tangai (fig. 4), where the fire licks out from a cavern occupied only by the Buddha, agrees perfectly with the Sanskrit texts cited in note 7. 183 A familiar story makes the monkey assume theyoga pose to bring about the conversion of a group of stubborn Brahman ascetics. See Przyluski, Ligende, pp. 309-3 I1 . 13a Soper, "The 'Dome of Heaven' in Asia", p. 234. I owe this suggestion to Dr. Schuyler Cammann. 70</page><page sequence="9">It would be unwise to claim that the special prominence of the cave theme in Northwest India and Afghanistan was due solely to extra-Indian influence. Indeed, in such a region of tangled cultures and at such a time, it would be difficult and perhaps impossile to assign any single, clearly defined source to a major religious concept, or even to separate "Indian" from "non-Indian". The most confusing factor is probably the double relationship between Aryan India and the Iranian world, an ancient kinship reinforced by later invasions and cultural penetration.'35 A common derivation of basic ideas has insured that Brahmanical literature should insist, almost as continually as Avestan, on the enormous importance to mankind of the sun and of fire as powers of good. Coomaraswamy has pointed out the many ways in which the cult of the Buddha seems to have borrowed attributes from Agni, the personified Fire. He has shown, again, how the subtle doctors of the Upanishad located the ultimate Person, the "Principial Being", in secret recesses of the heart often symbolized 135 The possibilities of this dual tie may be seen in the Mithraic Tauroctony. The sculptural form given the stele in the West strikingly resembles the Gandharan "Visit" for reasons connected with the political and religious situation of the Kushan empire. On the other hand, the fact that the interpretation given the death of the bull closely approaches one of the central elements of Brahmanical cosmogony, cannot be explained by any such contemporary interchange. Cumont's analysis of the most explicit Mithraic reliefs emphasizes the gushing forth of blood and sperm as life-giving essences from the dying animal (Textes et Monuments, I, pp. 188 ff). It is certainly no accident that the theme of a creator deity who in some way is wounded or dismembered or dissolved, and who in his flowing-apart becomes a universal source of life, should be continually reiterated in Brahmanical literature. The Mithraic version is a manifest borrowing from purer Iranian tradition, where the slain "primeval ox", though murdered by the Fiend, gives birth by its essences to the plant and animal kingdoms (West, SBE, V, pp. 31-32, translation of the "Bundahis", X). In India the late versions have been reinterpreted in ritualistic terms to prove the magical efficacy of the Brahmans' sacrifice; the divine being is usually their abstraction, Prajapati. Occasional statements of the theme suggest an earlier stratum of myth. The hero-victim may be Indra, the god so often described as a bull. A curious story tells how after slaying the monster Visvarupa (three-headed and six-eyed like Azhi Dahaka in the Iranian cycle) he seized and drank the holy Soma juice; and having thus "desecrated the sacrifice", at once dissolved into creative essences (Eggeling, SBE, XLIV, pp. 213 ff., 248 ff., translation of Satapatha Brihmana, V. Cf. ibid., XLI, pp. 130 ff.). Earliest may be the version in which Vrtra, "the coverer", when transfixed by Indra's bolt bursts open and releases the waters of life (Brown, "Creation Myth", p. 96). In remote antiquity there seems to be a clear parallel with the Babylonian epic telling of the battle between the sun-god Marduk and the powers of darkness; where the latter's defeat is signalized by the dismemberment of the goddess of Chaos, Tiamat, to provide the substance of the Creation (Frankfort, Cylinder Seals, p. 96). 71</page><page sequence="10">by guha, the cave.'36 Could not such an association of ideas, wholly within the development of the Indian mind, account for the appearance of the "Visit" stelae-in an age when Buddhism was losing whatever independence of the Brahmanical system it may once have possessed ? I am quite prepared to believe that the acceptance of the cave theme, and particularly its interpretation in Buddhist terminology rather than Iranian, may have been facilitated by a pre-existing environment of Brahmanical metaphysics. Specific evidence shows, however, that no matter how widely and from whatever sources sun and fire symbolism was infused into Buddhist iconography, its most consistent and strongest manifestations occurred in the Northwest, in the region that was also penetrated by Iranian influence. It is on a coin of Kaniska that the standing Buddha was first presented with an aureole of light about his whole body, like the sun-god.'37 In India proper even as late as the Ajanta frescoes the aureole is rare; whereas at Hadda the countless seated Buddhas are shown from the Kushan period on with both the solar aureole and the halo. The Shadow Cave outside of Hadda was a pilgrimage site known all over Asia, while that in Magadha was forgotten. The "Visit" theme, to which the tradition of the Upanishads might have given a special mystical content anywhere in Aryan India, was carved in stone from Gandhdra to Amardvati, to be sure, but won unique emphasis only in the Northwest. One of the two reliefs at Ndgdr- junakonda that illustrate the Indrajailaguha actually omits the cave setting, presumably from failure to understand its symbolic value.138 The type of legend in which the Buddha, or one of his great Arhats, or even Kaniska, quells an evil Ndga assigns him in the Northwest the proper solar attributes, fire or the thunderbolt-mace. It is hard to imagine the same sort of opposition in the iconographic context of the South, where as at Amardvati Naga worship has been so intimately associated with the Buddhist cult that the reliefs show snake bodies knotted around the stzpa, snake hoods shadowing the seated Lord as he meditates, or even a Ngga where one would expect the Buddha himself. Values are so altered that it is no surprise to find, when the Mahavansa describes how the Buddha overawed and con- 136 Coomaraswamy, Elements of Buddhist Iconography, Cambridge, Mass., 193 5, PP. 34, 8 ff. 137 Gardner, op. cit., pl. XVI, 8. 138 Longhurst, "Nagarjunakoinda", pl. XLIV. 72</page><page sequence="11">verted the assembled Yakkhas and Ndgas of Ceylon, that he is made to act through the Ndga's own weapons, darkness, rain, and cold.'9 The process of suffusing the Buddha idea with light symbolism reaches its climax in the "Siftra of the Sea of Mystic Ecstasy", which I have ascribed to the Hadda region. There almost every other value, ethical or metaphysical, has been drowned out in a blaze of light; and the Tathdgata is imagined as something like an enormous electrical display, acting only by the emission of rays that cross the universe. With more specific reference to the iconography of the cave, it is interesting to note that the Pali accounts of Indra's visit make the mountain luminous because of the god's arrival; they are divine beings from a sphere of light."4o It is the Sanskrit Dirghagama-sfttra that (at least in its Chinese translation) varies from its Pali cousin, the Digha-nikaya, most notably by its insertion of a new explanation: the mountain seems aflame because "the Lord is in the flaming ecstasy". Przyluski has shown how this sftra differs from the Pdli text in giving a much greater emphasis to the theme of Maitreya as Savior; and through this contrast has linked it with the Northern ideas of the Sarvdstivddin sect."'4 It would expand the dimens- ions of this paper beyond the limits of tolerance to attempt a supplementary study of the "flaming ecstasy" in Buddhist practise. The fact is obvious, at least, that what seems to have begun in the Pdli tradition as a part of the technique of meditation--the adept visualizing fire as he would the other elements -142 developed in an age of miracles into the exterior- ization of the fire element in the body. Such was the fire component of the Lord's "double miracle" at Srdvasti, which was repeated by his greatest disciples and their later followers, and in Ceylon was even re-enacted by his chief relic."43 By this ecstasy the Buddha downed the evil serpent who haunted the shrine of the Kdiyapa brothers.'" In it passed away to annihilation those Arhats who wished to enter Nirvana instantly.''" When the age of miracles 189 J. Burgess, "The Buddhist Stupas at Amaravati and Jaggayapeta", Arch.

As we have seen, it was in a suitra of Northern affiliations that the detail of the "flaming ecstasy" was added to the conventional account of Indra's visit. The well-known old story of the conversion of the K~ayapa brothers seems to have been modified in the same region to effect a similar combination of ideas. The traditional stage upon which the Lord quelled the Brahmans' snake was the hut in which their fire-worship was performed. The story goes that the Buddha asked the brothers for a night's lodging in their fire shrine, and overrode their objection that the place was made dangerous by a poisonous Ndga. He entered, sat in meditation; and when the creature emerged, emitted a fiery radiance against which its lesser command of flame was powerless. At the height of the contest the place seemed to be afire, and the Brahmans tried unsuccessfully to put it out. Finally the terrified Ndga took refuge inside the Buddha's alms-bowl and was revealed there to the Brahmans the next morning. The encounter, incidentally, is the one major exception to my propo- sition that the Buddha-Ndga duel belongs properly in the Northwest. Its importance, in comparison with the quelling of Apaldla or Gopdla, seems to me lessened by the fact that the Ndga figures as no more than a local nuisance, and so is nameless. Perhaps some of the malignance assigned to it in the story came from its association with the unbelieving Brah- mans. In the Eastern Apocrypha the "Apostolic History of Abdias" invents a similar encounter by St. Matthew in Ethiopia, with two magicians who came to meet him "with two crested dragons breathing fire and brimstone".'"7 The point at present important in the story of the Kdbyapa brothers' conversion is that the majority of those later versions that passed through the Northwest and Central Asia into China, speak of the duel as taking place in a cavern.

'8 THE DIPAMKARA BUDDHA MOTIF The "Visit" theme is re-stated, finally, in new terms explicitly acknowledging its unique importance, in a sutra traditionally assigned to Kashmir as a product of the grand council called by Kanishka: the Abhidharma-vibhasa-astra.149 The characters now have been shifted, and the moral has changed from a simple exposition of ethical teaching to the mystery of mystical experience. There are now only three principals: a Buddha of the Past called Tisya or Pusya (known otherwise only as a member of the group of Twenty-four Buddhas of the Past); and two Bodhisattva-disciples, Sakyamuni and Maitreya, both far advanced in spiritual perfection. The then Lord, finding that Sikyamuni was the riper of the two, decided to present him with an opportunity to complete his advance at one bound. He therefore took his mat, climbed up a mountain path to a cave of lapis lazuli, squatted within it in the 14s Foucher, Gandhara, I, pp. 447-450, fig. 225, b. The cavern is somewhat illogically combined with the incident of the Brahmans' attempt to put out the supposed fire in reliefs on the walls of Caves 6 and 12 at Yiin-kang; see Shinkai and Nakagawa, Rock Carvings, pls. 58, 122. Typical accounts retaining the original iconography are those of the Pali Makavagga, I, 15 (translated by T.W. Rhys Davids and H. Oldenberg in SBE, XIII, Oxford, 1881, as "the room where the fire was kept"; and the Sanskrit Mak~vastu, III, 428 ff. (translated by Vogel, Serpent Lore, p. io8, as referring to a "fire room", agni-s'arana). The group of Sanskrit writings (which I have consulted in their Chinese translations) that transform the room into a cave fj includes the Ekottaragama, III and XIV (Nanjid, no. 543; in Daiz6ky6, II, no. 125); the Dharmaguptavinaya, XXXII (Nanji6, no. I I 17; in Daizjky6, XXII, no. 1428); the MAiIasarvistivada-nik~ya- vinaya-sahghabhedakavastu, VI (Nanjid, no. I 123; in Daiz6ky6, XXIV, no. 1450); the "Sittra on the origin of the lucky fulfilment of the Crown Prince", II (Nanji6, no. 665, in Daiz6ky6, III, no. 185); the "Sfitra on the cause and effect of the past and the present", IV (Nanji6, no. 666, in Daiz6ky6, III, no. I89); the Samantaprabhasa-sitra, VIII (Nanjid, no. I60, in DaizJkyJ, III, no. 186); and the Vaipudya-mahavyuiha- siitra, XII (Nanjio, no. 159, in Dazz6kyo, III, no. 187). 149 Nanji6, no. 1263; translation by Hsiian-tsang in Daiz6kyd, XXVII, no. 1545, passage being in CLXXVII, p. 890, b. The episode is retold in the Abidharma-kosa-idstra by Vasubandhu, a native of Kaniska's capital (see Beal, op. cit., I, p. 105); translation by Hsiian-tsang, Nanjid, no. 1267, is in Daiz6ky6, XXIX, no. 1558. With modifications it appears again in Nagarjuna's Maht-prajnap ramiti-iistra, IV (see note 68).

For seven days and nights he sat thus in awful radiance, as if he were afire. SIkyamuni, following from a distance like a calf after its mother, saw the dread sight; was transfixed with joy, with one foot still in the air; and so remained while he praised his Master in a hymn. When the experience was completed he passed in- stantly across nine kalpas of spiritual development, to the final thresfold of Buddha-hood. This story, postulating a critical turning-point in Sakyamuni's career, suggests at once the more familiar 7dtaka in which he meets the then Buddha DIpamkara, and is for the first time told that he too will one day attain Enlightenment. The two stories of meetings between present and future Buddhas differ in much the same way as do the two "Visits". The Dipamkara tftaka, like the "Visit of Indra", is a picturesque episode, well suited to the il- lustration it so frequently received in GandhIran reliefs, but relatively undeveloped in relig- ious significance.'5" Its crowning action, the prostration of the young hermit so that the Buddha may walk across his long hair, is superficially no more than a courteous gesture. A deeper significance, half concealed as in the Indraiailaguha, probably lies in the fact that the name "Dipamnkara" conveys an idea of light; the translations given by the Chinese are such variants as "Constant Light", "Universal Light", "Blazing Torch". Can anything be done to localize the creation of the Dipamkara concept? He is a familiar figure in the Pdli Canon as well as in the Sanskrit. In Pdli, however, he is known primarily through the long introduction to the Idtaka Commentary that describes his meeting with the ascetic Sumedha, the future Sdkyamuni. The text itself dates as late as the Guptan period. Though the great majority of the 7dtaka tales presented are probably much earlier in origin, the material included in an introduction suggests naturally a tardy addition to the rest. DIpamkara appears as the first of a line of Twenty-four Buddhas of the Past, all of whom were like suns in burning away the dark shadows of evil.151 The set is obviously later than the chronologically-conceived Seven Buddhas, whose acceptance in pre-Kushan India is attested by their frequent appearance (in symbolic form) on the Sfichi gates.152 The number twenty-four is rare among Buddhist collections, which give such overwhelming 150 Foucher, Gandhlra, I, pp. 273-279. 151 H.

On the other hand it occurs several times in the religious imagery of the Near East at a comparable level of importance. It enumerates a set of Invisible Rulers in the Gnostic system of the Pistis Sophia, and the Elders round the throne of God in Revelations. Classical writers use it to define the Yazatas, "beings to be adored", of Zoroastrianism; and (perhaps as source of the rest) the star-gods whom the Babylonians ranked next in importance to those of the Zodiac.'53 The Buddhist series, if borrowed, differs primarily through translation into the only terms proper to Hinayana: a time sequence.'54 It is an interesting corroboration to find that Hsiian-tsang localizes the cult of DIpamkara at Nagarahara (i. e. Hadda);"'" and that the evidence of Buddhist art gives a preponderant importance to the Northwest in presenting his figure. The Dipavkara jataka has not been identified in pre-Kushan art. It is however a favorite subject with the Gandhdran sculptors, who emphasize its potentialities as a vivacious narrative. In Afghanistan the stelae from Shotorak reveal the special local position of Dipamkara by making him an oversized icon, against whose colossal scale even SIkyamuni is dwarfed (fig. 6). What we have found to be an increasing preoccupation with fire and light symbolism, in the passage of Buddhist iconography through the Northwest into Central Asia, explains why the Shotorak image should have flames bursting from his shoulders."'5 153 For the Pistis Sophia see translation by G. Horner, London, 1924, pp. xvii, xviii, 22, 89, 92. The 24 here are described as invisible emanations "out of the great Forefather Invisible". They are "of light more than the light of the sun which is in this world Io.ooo times. There is not any appearance in this world, nor is there light, nor is there shape comparable to the 24 Invisibles". On the Elders see H. Gunkel, Schopfung und Chaos, Gbttingen, 1895, pp. 305-308. The 24 Yazatas are mentioned by Plutarch, De Iside et Osiride, 47; the Babylonian deities by Diodorus Siculus, II, 31. 154 Dipamkara stands fourth in a set of 28 Buddhas; the 7fitaka commentator explains that while the 24 are those who in succession met the future Sakyamuni and prophesied his Buddha-hood, the 28 include 3 at the start who did not meet him, and end with Sakyamuni himself (Warren, op. cit., p. 32). Here the des- ire seems to be to compose within a chronologically more appropriate numeral, that of the 28 lunar stations. On Indian knowledge of these prior to the Buddhist age see A. B. Keith in The Cambridge History of India, Cambridge, 1922, pp. 139-140. 5-)5 Beal, op. cit., I, p. 92; Life, p. 57. Hsiian-tsang connects the two local legends of the Hadda region by explaining that it was at the sti.pa erected in memory of Dipamkara (miraculously intact through aeons) that the cowherd Naga, Gopala, prayed to be reborn as a destructive dragon to win vengeance. 156 See note 42.

The Sanskrit texts that show an interest in Dipamkara underline his role as a Lucifer in the literal sense, by added details. His mother's name may be given as Sun-and-moonlight. By magic he created a city far more splendid than the royal capital, and completely devoted to pleasure; only to have it consumed by fire as a moral lesson (that suggests the fiery purge of evil from the world at the Iranian Last Judgment). Quite properly, these texts are in large part the same as those that transfer the Buddha's duel with the Brahmans' snake to a cavern.157 It is thus apparent that Tisya- Pusya and DI- pamkara were conceived in the Northwest to satisfy one common function: to be present as a source of divine light from which Sakya- muni could take fire. The variation between the two legends may stem from a difference of sects or of dates. The encounter with Tisya-Pusya in the fire-trance seems the more mature of the two. Its emphasis on the act of meditation suits the character of Buddhism in the Northwest that is revealed by early Chinese evidence. The most famous missionaries who came to China in the fourth and fifth centuries from "Chi-pin", like Buddhabhadra and Gunavarman, were primarily experts in dbyanal."5 p. 143, illustrates a Guptan period relief from the Kanheri caves that presents the DZpam.kara 7Kitaka with a similar iconic formality and unnatural scale, but characteristically omits the flames.

The Northwest developed - I believe in the third or fourth centuries, after the breakup of the Kushan empire- a novel feature of stfipa decoration: a kind of dormer, breaking out from the curve of the dome on one or more axes as an emphatic accent. The "dormer" was of course not a window but a closed surface for sculptural enrichment; its design typically superimposed a number of relief panels, crowning the whole with a conventionalized chaitya arch.'59 A number of extant examples show that the sculptors took advantage of the new form to interrelate their reliefs more closely than before, using the superposition of relief fields to present a sequence of illustrations. Most interesting for our present purpose are those in which the subject cycle is the Buddha's "Renunciation of the World". Choice of illustrations for the upper tiers will vary, showing that these were of secondary interest; sometimes the panel immediately above the bottom (and largest) will show the prince leaving his wife's bed. The basic design used for the trapezoidal bottom panel is invariable: a "Departure from the City" shown frontally, the prince and his horse emerging head on from a city gate while persons on either side acclaim him (fig.7).160 The frequency of the theme and the emphasis given it by frontality and symmetry, as well as by placing, are remarkable. The treatment varies radically from the profile layout common for horses in motion. The "Departure" is illustrated in profile on more conventional Gandhdran reliefs (where it bears an odd resemblance to the Entry into Jerusalem in rever- se); and in that vein is most richly presented across a gateway beam at Safici.z61 The frontal horse and rider, moving directly out of the relief plane, represent such technical difficulties and so unusual a process of visualization that they must have a very special reason for (Kashmir and its environs ?), when he reached South China went to live as a hermit outside Canton; and there for a neighboring temple painted "the figures of Dipamkara and the young scholar spreading out his hair".

What that reason may have been, in Gandhdra of the post- Kushan period, is suggested by the one similar motif already available in the religious art of Near and Middle Asia: the quadriga of the sun-god, Mithra-Helios.'62 Early texts pay no marked attention to the "Departure" as such. The "Satra on the Origin of the Lucky Fulfilment of the Crown Prince", I, for example, which was translated into Chinese at the mid third cent- ury, dismisses the act of emergence from the city in a single sentence.'6 A highly developed account like that given in the various versions of the Lalita Vistara, on the other hand, presents it in apocalyptic terms as a drama witnessed by all the heavens. In the Vaipulya-mahavyaha-saitra, VI, the action takes place at mid- Fig. 7 Fragment of Gandhiran Stele. 3 - 5 th Centuries A.D. (?)

At the same time the details of the story suggest another parallel: the figure of Mithra, who from his palace on high keeps constant watch against the powers of evil; is ever ready with chariot, horses, and companions to sally forth against the wicked; and when the sun has set acts in its stead as a power dispelling demons all over the earth. e5 ADDENDUM Since first writing this paper, I have unearthed a number of other early Chinese references that indicate - certainly or with fair probability - an acquaintance with the iconography of the Shadow Cave. There is an unmistakable imitation of the whole story in two of the local Chinese legends collected by the mid seventh century church historian Tao-hsiian in his Tao-hsiian Lii-shih Kan-t'ung Lu ~f giF ~i A, S."66 First in connection with a temple called Hsiang-ssii-ssui in Fou-chou ~i 1 0Mi )V .- (Szechwan) he tells: "In the age of KdIyapa Buddha the mountain god there was named Lo Tzii-ming !R --  . As a native of Shu, he had previously been a monk who observed the commandments, and conceived a hatred of those who broke them. In consequence he uttered many evil prayers that after his death he might be reborn as a demon of great strength to eat commandment- breakers. Because of these prayers he received the body of a mountain god. He had a great host of underlings and ruled over (a vast territory). Every year he would eat more than 10o,o0oo men. This same god had once been the elder brother of Kdiyapa Buddha, and then had become his disciple. The Buddha once more took pity on him, and so came to convert A translation from the same (or a closely related) Sanskrit original into French by way of Tibetan is given by P. E. Foucaux, Lalitavistara (Annales du Mus~e Guimet, VI), Paris, 1884-92, passage being on pp. 185 ff. Similar exits are described in exuberant detail in Nanji6, no. 666 and 680; (passages in Daiz6ky6 III, pp. 633,a, and no. 190, p. 733); and in Nanji6, no. 1351, the Buddhacarita of Advaghosa as translated by Dharmaraksa in 414-21 (DaizJky6, IV, p. io), for which an English translation exists by Beal in SBE., XIX, pp. 57-58. 165 See translation of the Avestan "Mihir Yast" by Darmesteter, SBE, XXIII, pp. 132, 136, 143-144. 166 Reprinted in Daiz6ky6, LII, no. 2107, p. 438. An almost identical variant of this text, with a similar title, is in ibid. XLV, no. 1898, pp. 874 ff. 81</page><page sequence="20">him through all sorts of miracles. (The ogre) submitted and received the Five Commandments; and thus becoming aware of his previous existences, gave up his cannibalism. He feared a relapse, however, so the Buddha left behind a footprint. Over it King Aioka erected a stifpa on the mountain top; whereupon the god stored himself away in the rock. The present building is the one erected by King Aboka, and the god is still visible there". Immediately afterward Tao-hsiian tells a similar tale in connection with the "Temple of the Wonder-working Shrine", Ling-kang-ss(, on North Mountain in Hsiin-chou on the south coast Ai i~# ~ l+I 4lt di &amp; - (Kwangtung). The wide geographical separation of the two versions may well be a sign of general familiarity with the Shadow Cave original. Here the mountain god was said to have been converted in the same way by Mafijusri, and to fortify his resolution was given a footprint. He eventually died and was rewarded by rebirth in Tusita. "Now there was another god, a relative of the first, who came to take over his ter- ritory. He was a great evil-doer; so that the former deity from his place in Paradise became vexed, and begged Manfijusri to reform him as well, by smaller footprints. So (the second god also) followed the True Law; and today on that mountain both large and small prints are visible". Earlier references testify both to the prestige of the Shadow as an iconographic type, and to its imitation in China. Thus Tao-hsiian's anthology of early Buddhist writings includes a eulogy of an image of Sikyamuni made on behalf of the Southern Ch'i Emperor Wu by his son, the Prince of Ching-ling."67 "In (482) was reverently fashioned an image of Sdkya- muni, so divinely beautiful (that it seemed) a work of Heaven's art rather than anything made by man. Its lineaments tallied with those of the discarded Shadow; while in wond- rousness it surpassed the sandalwood (image of King Udydna)". Here as the two perfect prototypes, the cave apparition and the statue seem to epitomize seated and standing images of the Buddha. A rhapsody composed by the Liang prince who later became Emperor Ch'ien WXn (r. 550o-51), in honor of a jewelled replica of the Bodhi Tree manufactured for his father Wu, sums up the blessings of a peaceful and devout realm in this way:1'" "The Eight 167 Kuang Hung Ming Chi, XVI, reprinted in ibid., LII, no. 2103, p. 2II,b: "Ch'i Ching-ling Wang" Ma x 3E etc. le8 Ibid., XV, p. 204, a: "Shang Peu-ti Shu" ?_ . ~ etc. 82</page><page sequence="21">Winds are in harmony and the Vital Effluvia of the Four (Seasons) are in correct relation- ship. The realm is settled, the lands beyond the seas are at peace. The majesty of the Naga Cave is spread abroad, as the precepts of the Vulture Peak are handed on". In the last sentence the special authority given to the Buddha's preaching on the Vulture Peak, as embodied in the words of the great Lotus Si7tra, has its complement in the special authority of images derived from the Shadow. The same imperial prince, in a composition recording his manufacture of an eighteen foot dry lacquer image, draws another parallel. As an epitome of the famous Buddhist shrines of the West, two are chosen for literary balance: "the crystal stipa of the Nagas" in connection with the severed hair (of Sakyamuni), and a "mirrorbright stone shrine" in connection with the discarded Shadow.'69 In a debate held to decide whether or not to continue the Northern Chou persecution of Buddhism, the Buddhist champion, one Wang Ming-kuang I A JX, submitted in 58o a justification of the practise of building stzpas and making icons. The peroration runs: "From the time when the Shadow was discarded among the Kushans and the Body was cremated at (Kubi) nagara, when the relics were making their way everywhere and the Jeta- vana was built, all wise and holy men have had faith (in this means to) great blessedness; all sacred and honored ones have hoped for (this way of) capturing peace".'7 A number of other references to shadows are of more doubtful pertinence. With the general dissolution of conceptual boundaries effected by Mahayana, the idea of the Buddha's shadow as well seems to have lost its once specific character. Shadows, like mirror images, are apt illustrations for the philosopher preaching transience and illusion. When the Bud- dhist Gnostics had transformed their master into a fully transcendent deity, he could walk among men, be seen, heard, and touched, only by assuming the shadow of a human form, like the Gnostic Christ. His departure into Nirvana was then the discarding of a shadow, as the divine Christ abandoned the shadow Jesus on the cross.'7" So a Chinese votive incription of the Sui dynasty is clearly referring to the Paranirvana at Kudinagara, and not e69 Ibid., XVI, p. 21o, a: "Wei J n Tsao" iA -'0_ etc. 170 Ibid., X, p. I 59, a. 171 See note 130. 83</page><page sequence="22">to the apparition in the cave, in the words: "The Shadow reaches the twin trees, the relics are divided"."72 Another of Northern Ch'i uses the term to denote the appearance of the Buddha: the Han Emperor Ming's famous dream of a "golden man" is the result of "the Shadow's flight east- ward. 7' It was perhaps through this Buddhist interpretation that the Chinese ying W, "shadow", acquired the sense of "portrait". One can be reasonably sure that the Presence in the cave outside of Hadda, and not a mere theological abstraction, was meant only when the reference provides some specific clue. On a stele of 533, devotion to Buddhism is summed up in the sentence, "The world honors the teachings left to it, and in all humility depids the pattern of the Shadow"."' Dodrine and image here are made complementary, as in the eulogy by the Liang prince; the writer may have omitted identifying names either because the allusion was too familiar to require them, or because his meaning was now quite general. The same sort of tantalizing uncertainty dims our understanding of what was meant by two references to the great works of Northern Wei emperors. The seventh century anti-Taoist polemic Pien Ching Lun M iF_ =, recording the buildings and images given the church by a series of famous patrons, says of Hsiao Wen (r. 471- 500):.5 "At Ta-chiieh-ssti 3 ; P-f he restored the buildings, and with the most lavish generosity made presents of luxurious and beautiful (things), till Shadow Pagoda and Stitra Tower were splendidly complete. The top he had marked by a golden spire, while silver colums were set out below .. ." The same two building types are later recorded among the benefa&amp;ions of T'ang T'ai Tsung.16 172 Reprinted in Omura, Seigai's ifl J history of Chinese sculpture, Shina Bijutsu-skzi, Ch6chj-hen A 9R - +TV - K 9 X, Tokyo, 1915, P. 396. 17a Ibid., p. 345. 171 Ibid., p. 263. 175 By Fa-lin ItS, reprinted in Daiz6ky6, LII, no. 2110, p. 507, a. 176 Ibid., p. 514, b.

Was the "Shadow Pagoda" so called merely be- cause the relics it housed were portions of that Shadow who once had seemed to be Gautama Buddha? Or was this perhaps a stone building intended to recall the Shadow Cave, except- ional in Chinese architedure like the hundred foot pagoda of stone ere&amp;ed by Hsiao Wen's father ? "7 The latter, Hsien Wen (r. 466- 7), when he decided to abdicate in favor of his son, re- tired to a monastery he had built for the purpose in the palace park.7'" The name of this establishment, the "Deer-park Monastery", is one of the rare examples of a Chinese choice from the life of the "historic" Buddha. A flowery eulogy of the place by Kao Yiin Ai ft (390 -487), one of the greatest scholar-statesmen of the dynasty, runs in part: "Wherefore architects were ordered and craftsmen chosen to cut away the western range. Lavish in devotion and upright in thought, they reverently imitated the Divine Shadow, approaching the semblance of the True Countenance, and setting ablaze the brilliance of the golden radiance ...,79 Nothing more than a theological euphemism may be meant here. Yet it should be remember- ed that only about fifteen years before, the Wei capital had been visited by a party of Western monks who bore with them, as a unique rarity, an accurate representation of the Shadow in the cave.'8s The possible conne&amp;ion between these speculations and the cave sculptures at Yiin-kang would be an interesting subjeA for special study. It is curious to note, finally, that another early T'ang polemic against Taoism, the P'o Ya Lun TO$ 3fi , quotes from what I take to be a lost Taoist scripture this advice: "The student of the Tao should contemplate a journey to the West, (land of) the Great Brahma, Ta-fan -k , to visit the Shadow Palace and adore the Buddha"."8 1-77 Recorded in the Wei Sku's chapter on religions; see translation by Ware in T'oung Pao, p. 149. 178 Ibid. 179 Text in Kuang Hung Ming Chi, XXIX, p. 339, b.
