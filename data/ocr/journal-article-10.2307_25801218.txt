Garcea1 Food production originated in various ways in different parts of the world. Plant domestication with the adoption of agriculture has been successful in some areas, but not in others, where animal domestication with nomadic pastoralism proved to be more effective. Likewise, the preceding phases of pre-adaptation and development of a broad spectrum of wild resource ex ploitation followed different pathways, according to the locally available re sources, climatic and geographic conditions, and social organizations. North ern Africa greatly contributed to the understanding of the origin of food production under preconditions that differed from those in the Fertile Cres cent. Apart from a narrow strip along the Nile valley, northern African lands are arid and scarcely productive for agriculture. Nevertheless, early studies interpreted northern African archaeological records of the Early and Mid dle Holocene according to the traditional north-western Mediterranean and Near Eastern frames of reference. Consequently, terms such as "Epipalae olithic," "Mesolithic," and "Neolithic" were uncritically applied to north ern African contexts. This paper compares and discusses the evidence for food production in the Near East and northern Africa, considering the ques tion of introduction or local breeds of domesticated animals in the Maghreb and the Sahara. It then reviews the relevant data for long-held diffusion ist models of pastoralism into Africa to provide a different perspective and the proper means of interpretation of the northern African archaeological records.

KEY WORDS: animal domestication; pastoralism; northern Africa; Libyan Sahara; Uan Tabu. INTRODUCTION: SOME BASIC ASSUMPTIONS Northern Africa played a prominent role in early discoveries of the be ginnings of food production and the preceding processes of pre-adaptation. Its natural conditions, with oases not far from the Nile river, and subsistence patterns, with the exploitation of a broad spectrum of natural resources, were recognized as the appropriate pre-conditions that led to food produc tion (Caton-Thompson and Gardner, 1934; Caton-Thompson, 1952; Childe, 1956; Clark, 1971). Nevertheless, Near Eastern perspectives have biased in terpretation of the African archaeological data, even though Africa did not follow Near Eastern patterns and has shown distinct pathways to food pro duction. Many Africanist archaeologists relied for long on the artifactual ma terial collected during expeditions that aimed at various purposes other than archaeology. Military, geographic, and geological explorations often included an archaeologist in their team. Surface surveying and collecting were the only activities that could be carried out under those conditions. As a consequence, the cultural sequence of Saharan archaeology was mainly based on single artifactual indicators. Pottery became the indicator for the assemblages of later prehistory. When it was present, an assemblage was considered "Neolithic"; when it was absent, an assemblage was "Epipalae olithic" or "Mesolithic." For several decades, terminological issues have clouded interpreta tion of African data and the history of archaeological research on the beginnings of food production in the Near East and northern Africa. Therefore, they need to be critically reviewed. The terms referring to the cultural horizons of the Holocene in northern Africa have been de rived from the traditional archaeological records of the Mediterranean basin and the Near East: "Epipalaeolithic," "Mesolithic" and "Neolithic." Pottery and polished stone tools were taken as indicators of the "Ne olithic" cultures. As pottery in the north-western Mediterranean and the Near East was contemporaneous or even later than food production, it was assumed that the occurrences of pottery and grinding stones even in other regions, like northern Africa, were "guide fossils" for a productive subsistence economy. The assumption was that any site with pottery or grindstones should have been "Neolithic" (e.g., Balout, 1955; Hugot, 1963;</page><page sequence="3">Alternative Way Towards Food Production in the Libyan Sahara 109 Maitre, 1972). As a consequence, the perspective based on technological data biased the interpretation of the economic system of northern African peoples. A large part of earlier research in the Sahara was based on surface sur veys; organic remains were rarely found and economic data were usually missing, but always inferred. Furthermore, in numerous northern African sites, ceramics appeared much earlier than domesticates. They only oc curred simultaneously in the Egyptian oases of Nabta Playa and Bir Kiseiba (Close et al, 1980; Close, 1984; Wendorf et al, 1989, 2001; Wendorf and Schild, 1998). Nevertheless, all sites including pottery and/or grindstones have been for long attributed to an undifferentiated period of over 6000 years named "Saharo-Sudanese Neolithic" (Camps, 1974). The "Saharo Sudanese Neolithic" was thought to be spread from the Atlantic coasts of Mauritania to the Sudanese Nile valley, covering an immense area of over 7,000 km from west to east, and 2,000 km from north to south. As a conse quence, such an indiscriminate definition neglected regional diversities and local variability. The sense of the term Neolithic emphasizing the revolutionary changes brought by food production in the prehistory of the Near East and Europe (sensu Childe, 1956) received little attention in the Maghreb and even less in most of the Sahara, apart from the Egyptian oases. The technological changes, like the production of pottery and grinding stones, seemed to be a result of the economic innovation that implied sedentarisation, which was usually not the case in northern Africa. Nevertheless, research on African prehistory remained at the margins of the scientific debate. The broad perspective implying human adaptations to the changing environ ment (Binford, 1968) or to increasing population pressure (Cohen, 1977; Binford, 1983) inspired research on the Nile valley and the Egyptian Sahara, but did not trigger a different perspective of the investigations in the rest of northern Africa (see also the considerations by Hassan, 1984; Wenke and Casini, 1989). A few scholars have recently adopted a different approach encompass ing interdisciplinary investigations. Cultural dynamics and human behav iors are considered in relation to climatic and environmental conditions, vegetal and animal landscapes, depositional and post-depositional events (i.e., Wendorf and Schild, 1976,1980,1989; Close et al, 1980; Close, 1984; Barich, 1987, 1998b; Cremaschi and di Lernia, 1998b; Churcher and Mills, 1999; di Lernia, 1999b; Garcea, 2001; Hassan et al, 2001; Wendorf et al., 2001; di Lernia and Manzi, 2002). The question whether domesticated animals were brought into the Maghreb and the Sahara or were locally bred deserves some considerations, which are dealt with below. This paper also offers a review of the relevant</page><page sequence="4">110 Garcea data for long-held diffusionist models of pastoralism into Africa in order to provide a different perspective and the proper means of interpretation of the northern African archaeological records. It also discusses north-eastern African data for the beginnings of food production and recent findings from the Tadrart Acacus, in the Libyan Sahara, which contribute to clarification of distinctive African pathways. NEAR EASTERN AND NORTH AFRICAN PATTERNS The organization of the early villages in the Near East was correlated to the incipient stages of pre-adaptation that led to the new economic sys tem (Flannery, 1969,1973; Braidwood, 1973). Pre-adaptation models were also tentatively applied to the Nile valley (among others, Clark, 1971) and to the southern Sahara (Clark et al, 1973). However, even though some preconditions existed in both areas, their inhabitants chose to respond to their new emerging needs of intensification and increased predictability of resources in different ways. Thus, different indicators must be looked for in the archaeological records. In fact, in northern Africa, domestication was often a later event than pottery and grindstone production. Moreover, semi sedentary settlements came into place before domestication and favored the use of ceramic containers and grinding stones. Unfortunately, research in northern Africa did not follow the path of the scientific debate that went on in the last 50 years in the Near East and in Europe. Other aspects - economic, social, environmental (Zvelebil, 1986; Bar-Yosef and Meadow, 1995; Tchernov, 1995), and even cognitive (Cauvin, 1997) - have received much attention in many parts of the world, but not northern Africa. Furthermore, in the Near East, regionalist perspectives are now pre ferred to a blanket approach (Aurenche and Kozlowski, 1999). Each region is associated to its distinctive ecological niche and has its own specific de velopments. Even though people from various areas were in contact with each other, they were not identical everywhere. Similarities were the con sequence of "political" relations and not caused by common origins. There fore, diversity is regarded as a cultural indicator of the different traditions that developed in the Near East (Caneva, 2001). In view of such an articu lated system, northern Africa was not just a Near Eastern colony or the last frontier of a diffusionist movement. In northern Africa, apart from the exception of the Egyptian Sahara (i.e. Close et al, 1980; Close, 1984; Wendorf and Schild, 1989; McDonald, 1998; Churcher and Mills, 1999), a wider perspective was only recently adopted and applied to the rest of the Sahara, particularly to the Libyan</page><page sequence="5">Alternative Way Towards Food Production in the Libyan Sahara 111 Sahara (cf., Barich, 1987, 1998b, 2002; Cremaschi and di Lernia, 1998b; di Lernia, 1999b; Garcea, 2001; di Lernia and Manzi, 2002). In the Sahara, the Maghreb and the upper Nile valley, the food producing economy was based on cattle and sheep/goat herding. Various attempts at taming and possibly also domesticating other animal species, such as Barbary sheep, might have been made, but could not be fully ac complished. When pastoralism replaced the fully hunting-gathering econ omy, nomadism had to be increased and lighter equipment had to be produced. Therefore, the "Neolithic" economy in the Sahara did not im ply sedentism, as in the Near East, where agriculture was the main eco nomic activity. In contrast, it led to systematic nomadism and to the tra ditions typical of pastoralist cultures, and herding remained the primary economic activity of food production for several millennia. On the other hand, in northern Africa, pottery production had already started even be fore the adoption of the "Neolithic" economy, as semi-sedentary organi zation was in place among the latest foraging populations (among others, Caneva, 1983, 1993; Caneva and Marks, 1990; Close, 1995; Garcea, 2001; Nelson et aL, 2002). The term "pastoralism" used in this paper refers to the economic sub sistence that depends on the exploitation of domestic animal herds for food production. This implies the adoption of a nomadic settlement pattern to fulfil the need to move herds to pasture. Pastoralists are those who raise domestic livestock and move their herds for grazing according to seasonal availability of pasture (Dyson-Hudson and Dyson-Hudson, 1980; Marshall and Hildebrand, 2002). ANIMAL DOMESTICATION IN THE NEAR EAST Animal herding in the Near East is more or less contemporaneous with agriculture, although it was originally thought to be later. Full do mestication is alternatively dated either from the second half of the tenth millennium b.p. (ninth millennium cal. b.c.), corresponding to the Early Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) (Vigne, 2000; Horwitz, 2003), or from about 9000 b.p. (8000 cal. b.c), corresponding to the early Middle PPNB (Aurenche and Kozlowski, 1999). The earliest morphologically modified forms of domesticated caprines (goat and sheep) appeared in south-eastern Turkey, in the southern slopes of the eastern Tauros mountains, where the Euphrates with its tributaries and the upper Tigris flow, as attested to at Nevah Qori (Fig. 1) dated from ca. 9200 b.p. (Hauptmann, 1999). Goat do mestication in the Iranian Zagros was independent from the domestication processes that took place in south-eastern Anatolia (Vigne, 2000). On the</page><page sequence="6">112 Garcea Fig. 1. Map of Near Eastern sites and locations mentioned in the text. other hand, the practice of intensive management of "predomesticated" species of both aurochs and caprines, which were not morphologically mod ified, very rapidly and very early spread from the Zagros mountains to the eastern Mediterranean basin before the end of the tenth millennium b.p. (Vigne and Buitenhuis, 1999; Guilaine et aL, 2000; Zeder and Hesse, 2000). In the southern Levant and possibly in central Anatolia, domesticated species appeared later, in the Late PPNB, around 8000-8500 b.p. (7000-7500 cal. b.c.). Some authors (e.g., Vigne and Buitenhuis, 1999; Vigne, 2000) sug gest that domesticates spread from Anatolia to the south, to the middle Euphrates, and to the west, to Cyprus, where domesticated animals were intentionally imported from the mainland. Others (Horwitz, 2003) main tain local autochthonous domestication of goats in multiple loci, including the southern Levant and central Anatolia. Incipient domestication of goat is postulated on the basis of the presence of the wild progenitor of domestic goat (Capra aegagrus). Domesticated goat (Capra hircus) was found at sites dated from around 8900 b.p. (8000 cal. b.c.) in the Zagros mountains, at Ganj Dareh, Guran and Ali Kosh (Iran), and slightly later, from ca. 8500 b.p. in the</page><page sequence="7">Alternative Way Towards Food Production in the Libyan Sahara 113 northern Levant, along the Euphrates, at Abu Hureyra and Halula (Syria) (Helmer, 1992; Legge, 1996; Aurenche and Kozlowski, 1999). Domesticated sheep (Ovis aries) was dated to 8700-9000 b.p. (7700 8000 cal. b.c.) in the Djezireh, at Nemrik (Iraq) and Tell Assouad (Syria), along the Euphrates, at Abu Hureyra, Halula and Bouqras (Syria), and in the Deh Luran, at Ali Kosh (Iran) (Helmer, 1992; Aurenche and Kozlowski, 1999). During the PPNB, sheep was better adapted to the flat and gently slop ing environment in the northern Levant. On the other hand, goat was more widespread in the southern Levant, which had steep slopes and a dissected terrain. There, the different environment, together with different grazing habits of sheep and goat, led to an abrupt interruption in the occupation of the local PPNB sites (Kohler-Rollerfson, 1988). Such a change probably favored the chances of contact with northern Africa, where there were no local wild progenitors of either goat or sheep. In the central and western European Mediterranean basin as well, sheep and goat were slowly intro duced from the east as domesticates, as they did not have local wild ances tors (Vigne and Helmer, 1999). In the Near East, domesticated cattle (Bos taurus) appeared later than domesticated sheep and goat, along the Euphrates around 8500-9000 b.p. (7500-8000 cal. b.c), at Nemrik (Iraq), Halula and Bouqras (Syria). In Syria, it was also present along the Mediterranean coast, at Ras Shamra Vc (Helmer, 1992; Aurenche and Kozlowski, 1999). The spread or adoption of domesticated animals from their areas of greatest antiquity towards south-western Asia was a long and slow process. It took at least 1000 years before domesticates reached the southern Lev ant. In fact, at Qatif Y2 near Gaza, in Israel, domestic cattle and caprines were dated only to the sixth millennium b.p. and are associated with pottery (Horwitz, 2003). THE POTENTIAL LINKS One direct route of domesticates between the Near East and Africa could have possibly been northern Sinai and the Nile Delta. However, in formation on the Early Neolithic is extremely scanty in northern Sinai, being represented by rare artifactual materials, but no archaeozoological evidence for domesticates (Bar-Yosef and Phillips, 1977; Goldberg and Bar-Yosef, 1982). Not only domesticated fauna, but also pottery was absent in northern Sinai, such as, for example, at Ein Qadis I. The architectural and artifactual remains from this site could be included in the PPNB or Big Arrowheads Industries (B AI), dated between the second half of the tenth</page><page sequence="8">114 Garcea millennium b.p. (ninth millennium cal. b.c) to the end of the ninth millen nium b.p. (eighth millennium cal. b.c.) (Aurenche and Kozlowski, 1999). In northern Sinai, the sites on the Jebel Maghara, particularly in the Mushabi region, were attributed to the Final PPNB, although they were only surface complexes (Cauvin, 1997). East of the Sinai, at lower altitudes, on the edges of the Araba depression, there was the Late PPNB site of Nahal Issaron, which showed circular structures and domesticated goat. This site was con sidered as a temporary station occupied by pastoralists (Cauvin, 1997). An even later evidence for nomadic pastoral occupations comes from the east-central Sinai, in the upper Wadi Girafi Basin, Egypt. These sites date from around 7000 b.p. and were attributed to the Early Chalcolithic (Eddy and Wendorf, 1998; Eddy et al., 1999). Other Pottery Neolithic sites, such as Qatif, located on the Israeli and Gaza coastal strip, confirm that certain cultural contacts between the Levant and northern Africa occurred, but only during the seventh and early sixth millennia b.p. (Smith, 1992b, 1996). However, the pottery from Qatif, in Israel, is cruder and later than that in northern African (Smith, 1989). A specific survey in north-western Sinai, including the easternmost part of the Nile Delta was dedicated to the identification of contacts between southern Palestine and the Nile valley (Caneva, 1992, 1996). In spite of that, neither Predynastic nor Palestinian Early Bronze Age materials could be found. Human occupations in the area have always been seasonal and temporary, including those that left some archaeological materials begin ning from the Ptolemaic period. Several sites in the eastern Delta were also dated from the Late Predynastic time (Abd el-Moneim, 1996). Another sur vey in the north-western Nile Delta yielded a very large number of sites, the earliest of them dating to the Late Predynastic period ca. 4300 years b.p. (3300 b.c.) (van den Brink, 1993). As a matter of fact, rare Early Neolithic sites in the Nile Delta of Egypt seem to have been located only around the edges of the Delta, but not in the interior (Krzyzaniak, 1989). At Merimde-Benisalame, also in the Nile Delta, pig, cattle and caprines only appeared from around 6100 b.p. (Chenal Velarde, 1997) or from 5850 b.p. (Gautier, 1987). The lack of Neolithic sites suggested a discontinuity with the successive Predynastic occupations in the inner Delta. Moreover, local crop production was practiced in the Predy nastic period in the Delta. However, no import of cereals from the Levant could be recognized in the area (Thanheiser, 1996). In the Fayum depression, which is located about 100 km south-west of Cairo, farming of Near Eastern crops, mainly emmer wheat and bar ley, is well attested in the Fayum A period, dated from the middle of the seventh millennium b.p. (Neumann, 2005). However, animal remains of do mesticated sheep, goat and cattle are extremely rare and date from the end</page><page sequence="9">Alternative Way Towards Food Production in the Libyan Sahara 115 of the sixth millennium b.p. (Gautier, 1987). Furthermore, lithic tool-kits are different from those found in both the Nile valley and the Egyptian Western Desert (Wendorf and Schild, 1976). Connections between the Buto-Maadi in Egypt and the Palestinian Ghassul-Beersheba cultures were attested to during different periods, all later than the Neolithic (Schmidt, 1993). Some of these features from Maadi were dated to 4700-4900 b.p. (Caneva et al, 1989). Geomorphological reasons for the lack of archaeological evidence of relations between northern Africa and south-western Asia should also be considered. It is possible that the occasional contacts that the archaeozoo logical evidence seems to indicate left no archaeological traces due to the effect of aggradation with sedimentation or erosion processes that covered or removed most archaeological remains. It has been observed that there were few economic or cultural resem blances between northern Africa and south-western Asia during the Early Holocene. Even the Nile valley did not share the common Neolithic char acteristics that linked the different regions in south-western Asia, from the Mediterranean to Turkistan, including domesticated wheat, barley, pulses, goats, sheep, pigs and cattle, sedentary villages, rectangular houses, and the use of obsidian (Smith, 1976). Furthermore, the Neolithic economy in the Near East displayed a number of changes, such as permanent sedentary set tlements associated with burials, "heavy" stone equipment, stone vessels, hafted "knives," and mobiliary art (Henry, 1989; Kaufman, 1992; Aurenche and Kozlowski, 1999). None of these features occurred together in northern Africa in the eighth/seventh millennium b.p. In northern Africa, they only appeared in northern Egypt, but in later times. Another possible link between the Near East and Africa could have been the Gulf of Suez. The recent excavations in the plain of El Qaa, and particularly at the site of Abu Gedar 2, in south-western Sinai, indicate that the chronology of domestic caprines is between 6000 and 6600 b.p., which is earlier than in Lower Egypt (Close, 2002). Considering the dates from El Qaa in combination with those from Nabta Playa (6500-7000 b.p.), Dakhleh oasis (6500-6900 b.p.), and Sodmein cave (6300^-7000 b.p.), a maritime route across the Gulf of Suez seems a plausible alternative to the land route across northern Sinai (Close, 2002). Sea crossing was also suggested with regards to the colonization of the Nile Delta by Levantine farmers after the collapse of the PPNB civilization (Bar-Yosef, 2002). In addition to contacts between the Near East and northern Africa, an early hypothesis suggested direct movements between Sicily and Tunisia (Camps, 1974; Ferembach, 1986). However, such links can now be def initely ruled out in consideration of the recently acquired chronology of the Uzi cave, in Sicily (Italy) which placed domesticated goats at a</page><page sequence="10">116 Garcea later period than the beginning of the eighth millennium b.p. (Vigne and Helmer, 1999). To put it in P.E.L. Smith's words, the Near East acted not as much as a "cornucopia," but as an "intermittently leaky faucet" (Smith, 1976, p. 170). On the other hand, eastward movements or exchanges of peoples and ideas from the Sahara to the Nile valley did also take place at different times, from around 7000 b.p. (see, among others, Arkell, 1955; Smith, 1976; Hassan, 1987; Caneva and Marks, 1990; Caneva, 1988b, 1993; Garcea, 1993). Due to a climatic deterioration, between 6000 and 7000 b.p., some human groups from the central and eastern Sahara should have entered into contacts with populations in the Egyptian oases and the Nile valley. ANIMAL DOMESTICATION IN NORTHERN AFRICA The eastern Sahara of Egypt has been the main focus in northern Africa where research on the origins and the pre-conditions preceding food production was conducted (cf., among others, Close et al, 1980; Close, 1984; Wendorf and Schild, 1980, 1989; Wendorf et al, 2001). The oases in the Egyptian Western Desert include, from north to south, Gara and Siwa (Wendorf and Hassan, 1980), Farafra (Barich and Hassan, 1984-1987, 2000; Barich, 1996,1998a,b; Barich et al, 1996; Hassan et al, 2001), Dakhleh (McDonald, 1992, 1996, 1998; Marlow, 1998; Churcher and Mills, 1999; Wiseman, 2004), Kharga (Caton-Thompson, 1952; Wendorf and Schild, 1980), Bir Kiseiba (Close, 1984; Wendorf et al, 1989), and Nabta Playa (Close et al, 1980; Wendorf and Schild, 1998; Wendorf et al, 2001). Furthermore, the lower and upper Nile valley provided evidence for distinctive forms of acquisition of domesticated plants and animals (cf., among others, Clark, 1971; Wendorf and Schild, 1976; Hoffman, 1980; Caneva, 1983,1988a; Hassan, 1984,1987; Haaland, 1987; Krzyzaniak, 1991, 1992,1995; Reinold, 1991,1997,1998; Fernandez, 2003). The Fayum has long been another major area of interest to prehis torians (Caton-Thompson and Gardner, 1934; Puglisi, 1967; Wendorf and Schild, 1976; Kozlowski and Ginter, 1989). It appeared of particular inter est as it yielded both wild aurochs and domestic cattle dating to 5900 b.p. (Gautier, 1987). Wild aurochs were also found in both Paleolithic and Neolithic occu pations at Haua Fteah, on the Libyan coast, east of Tripoli, even though domestic cattle, sheep and goat appeared during a period dated between 6400 and 7000 b.p. (Higgs, 1967; Klein and Scott, 1986). The existence of wild aurochs at several sites in northern Africa sug gested that this species could have been locally domesticated, before other</page><page sequence="11">Alternative Way Towards Food Production in the Libyan Sahara 117 domestic species were introduced from the Near East. The North African aurochs (Bos primigenius ssp.) was the endemic wild progenitor of cattle and a colonization process from a center of origin has been postulated. The eastern Sahara appeared to be the most likely region of origin from where migration occurred westward and southward (Hanotte et al, 2002). Further more, the Egyptian cattle was morphologically different from the Eurasian humpless cattle (Bos taurus) and the zebu (Bos indicus), suggesting that the African cattle was domesticated from a common wild ancestor in Africa, Bos primigenius mauritanicus (Grigson, 2000). It has also been noted that the climatic and genetic conditions in northern Africa could have supported local domestication. Diffusion of cattle breeds from western Asia into Africa is now also contradicted on both molecular and morphological bases. Mitochondrial variants suggest a predomestic separation of the ancestors of African and European bovines. Estimates indicate at least 22,000 years since the exis tence of a common ancestor for the two continental strains (Loftus et al, 1994; Bradley et al, 1996; Bradley and Loftus, 2000). The earliest putative cattle bones were found in the Western Desert of Egypt, at Nabta Playa, dating as early as 9500 b.p., and at Bir Kiseiba about 8840 b.p. (Gautier, 1984,1987, 2001; Wendorf et al, 1989, 2001). The chronology of domestic cattle at Nabta Playa is older than in the Near East and, therefore, corroborates an independent domestication of cattle in northern Africa, as also biological and genetic data indicate (Gautier, 2001). Furthermore, the linguistic evidence of Nilo-Saharan language groups sup ports early cattle pastoralism (Ehret, 1993). It has been suggested that cattle pastoralists brought their herds into the desert oases after the summer rains: cattle could survive in these environmental conditions that were drier than those in the Nile val ley thanks to the management skills of their herders (e.g., Close and Wendorf, 1992). As the African aurochs is a typical paleoarctic species, it could live in the Maghreb and the Nile Valley, but was never found in the Sahara (Chenal-Velarde, 1997). Therefore, cattle should have reached the Sahara in its domesticated form, during trading exchanges which earlier implied Saharan influences over Nilotic traditions, such as the use of dotted-wavy line pottery in "pre-pastoral" times (Garcea, 1998b). The origin of domestication of caprines in northern Africa is different from that of cattle. No wild forms of sheep and goat existed in northern Africa and domestic caprines appeared at a later stage than cattle. Caprines were introduced from the Near East into northern Africa during the pe riod around 6700-7000 b.p. (Gautier, 1987; Smith, 1996). Domestic sheep (Ovis aries) is descendant from the Asiatic mouflon (Ovis orientalis), and</page><page sequence="12">118 Garcea domestic goat (Capra hircus) originates from the scimitar-horned Capra ae gagrus of western Asia (Clutton-Brock, 1997). Domestic caprines appeared in coastal northern Africa after the end of the eighth millennium b.p., between 6400 and 7000 years b.p., at Haua Fteah (Cyrenaica, Libya) (Higgs, 1967; Klein and Scott, 1986), and in the Fayum (Lower Egypt) at the end of the sixth millennium b.p. (Smith, 1992a). They are earlier in Upper Egypt, where they were dated, at Nabta Playa, from about 6500 b.p. (Gautier, 2001), or 7000 b.p. (Close, 2001,2002), at Dakhleh oasis, from 6500-6900 b.p. (McDonald, 1998), and at Sodmein cave, in the Red Sea hills, between 6300 and 7000 b.p. (Vermeersch et al, 1994,1996). It is possible that domestic sheep and goat entered Africa together with cattle and probably spread along the Mediterranean African coasts. This does not rule out that independent cattle domestication in northern Africa had already taken place (Gautier, 1987). THE EVIDENCE FROM THE CENTRAL SAHARA In comparison to the Nile valley and the Egyptian oases, the central and western Sahara is still much less well known. Apart from a few cases, little attention has been paid to food production in the central and western Sahara. The consequent assumption was that food production in the interior of northern Africa followed the changes adopted in the oases west of the Nile, in the eastern Sahara. Nevertheless, none of the available data supports the practice of farm ing in the central and western Sahara. Animal herding was the only subsis tence activity based on the exploitation of domesticates. Evidence comes from the Algerian Sahara, at Amekni, Meniet, Adrar Tiouyine and In Relidjem. It has been suggested that pastoralism with cattle and caprines was adopted after the middle of the sixth millennium b.p. (Gautier, 1987). Similar datings were obtained from the southern Sahara, in the Adrar Bous (Carter and Clark, 1976; Gautier, 1987). A slightly earlier date, around 6300 b.p., for domestic cattle came from Adrar Bous 1 (Roset, 1987). The Libyan Sahara appeared to provide earlier dates for pastoral sites. Uan Muhuggiag, in the central Tadrart Acacus, was dated to about 7400 years b.p. However, this radiocarbon date was measured in the early 1960s (Mori, 1965), when radiocarbon dating methods were at their beginning, and should be taken with some skepticism - also in consideration of the other dates of the same site and others in the Tadrart Acacus. In fact, the rest of the Uan Muhuggiag sequence was dated from ca. 6035 b.p. At Ti-n Torha North, in the northern Tadrart Acacus, the lowest layer was dated to ca. 7070 b.p., but did not include animal remains, whereas the upper layers,</page><page sequence="13">Alternative Way Towards Food Production in the Libyan Sahara 119 dated from ca. 5970 b.p., contained an important quantity of cattle bones (Barich, 1974; Cassoli and Durante, 1974). Indications for a pastoral occu pation were also present at Uan Telocat, in the same mountain range, which provided datings from ca. 5900 b.p., although a date obtained in the 1960s was ca. 6745 b.p. (Garcea and Sebastiani, 1995,1998). A review of the data is given below. A Case-Study from the Libyan Sahara The Tadrart Acacus is a sandstone mountain range in the central Sahara, south-western Libya (Fig. 2). It is crossed by several wadis that run from west to east and it is delimited by a steep scarp to the west. Several rockshelters are located along these wadis. Some of them served as human occupations since the late Pleistocene. They exhibit thick accumulations of archaeological deposits, with artifacts, well-preserved organic materials and, occasionally, structural features. Distinctions based on economic subsistence patterns seemed to be more accurate than those based on artifactual material. In fact, pottery or any other technological product by itself is usually insufficient for typify ing the various cultural units unless a broader cultural context has already been described. Therefore, the distinction between "prepastoral" and "pas toral" cultures seemed to be the necessary priority (Garcea, 1993). These broad contexts could be further differentiated into more specific cultural units. Within the prepastoral horizon, two different units could be sepa rated. They were originally called "Epipalaeolithic" and "Mesolithic" (di Lernia, 1996). Later, in order to avoid Mediterranean-biased correlations, they were renamed Early Acacus and Late Acacus (di Lernia and Garcea, 1997). The subsequent horizon was named Pastoral Neolithic (Garcea and Sebastiani, 1995, 1998; Cremaschi and di Lernia, 1996) or Pastoral (Cremaschi and di Lernia, 1998a, 1999a). Three phases, Early, Middle and Late, could be identified within the Pastoral horizon. The following description takes into consideration the Early Acacus, the Late Acacus and the Early/Middle Pastoral horizons. It is mainly based on the data from the latest excavations at Uan Tabu (Garcea, 1996a, 1998a, 2001). It also attempts to integrate this evidence into the general frame work of the concession area of the Joint Italo-Libyan Mission for Prehis toric Research in the Sahara of the Centro Interuniversitario per Ricerche sulle civilta del Sahara Antico e delle zone aride (CIRSA), University of Rome "La Sapienza," formerly directed by F. Mori and presently by M. Liverani, in the central Sahara, south-western Libya.

Between the two ranges, there is the erg Uan Kasa and, south of the Messak Settafet, the Edeyen of Murzuq (Fig. 2). Excavated Sites The northern part of the Tadrart Acacus mountain range includes the wadi Auis, where a complex of sites was excavated in the Ti-n-Torha area. It comprises three main rockshelters: Ti-n-Torha East, Ti-n-Torha North and Ti-n-Torha Two Caves (Barich, 1974,1987). Several sites were excavated in the central part of the Tadrart Acacus: Uan Muhuggiag (Mori, 1965; Barich, 1987) and Uan Muhuggiag Wadi (di Lernia and Manzi, 1998), Uan Afuda (di Lernia, 1999b), Uan Tabu (Mori, 1965; Garcea, 2001) and Uan Telocat (Mori, 1965; Garcea and Sebastiani, 1998). Uan Muhuggiag and Uan Tabu are located in the wadi Teshuinat, a major seasonal water course that runs parallel to the mountain range, Uan Afuda is situated in the wadi Kessan, a tributary of the wadi Teshuinat, and Uan Telocat is located in the wadi Imha, a smaller wadi south of the Teshuinat. On the upper terrace facing the same wadi, another excavation was carried out at the burial site of Imenennaden (di Lernia and Manzi, 1998). In the southern Tadrart Acacus, an excavation was conducted at Fozzigiaren I (di Lernia and Manzi, 1998; di Lernia and Garcea, in prepa ration), which is the main site named after the largest wadi in the mountain range called Fozzigiaren (Mori, 1965). All the above sites are in rockshelters and have rock art paintings and rarely engravings depicted on their walls. Chrono-cultural attributions have been recently revised (di Lernia, 1996; Garcea, 2001) and are summarized in Table I. Some Pastoral pot sherds were also collected on the surface at two prepastoral sites, Uan Tabu and Fozzigiaren I. Middle Pastoral sites were frequent in the Tadrart Acacus, whereas Early Pastoral archaeological records were rare.

The radiocarbon dates for the Early Acacus at Uan Tabu go from 9810 ? 75 years b.p. to 8880 ? 100 b.p. They cover the entire chronologi cal span of the Early Acacus, whereas the Late Acacus occupational de posit is probably partly eroded as it spans from 8870 ? 100 to 8580 ? 80 b.p. (Tables II and III). At Uan Afuda, the latest date is 8000 ? 110 b.p. (di Lernia, 1998; Cremaschi and di Lernia, 1999b). The Late Acacus horizon lasted at other sites in the area until around 7400 b.p. (di Lernia, 1996; Cremaschi and di Lernia, 1998a, 1999a). Continuity in the settlement systems from the Late Acacus to the Early Pastoral occupations has been suggested (Cremaschi and di Lernia, 1998a, 1999a). However, at Uan Muhuggiag Wadi, the Late Acacus sequence is interrupted by a major discontinuity, which was below the Pastoral occupation (di Lernia and Manzi, 1998). At Ti-n-Torha North, the upper Middle Pastoral layers (I and II) were separated from the lower human occupation by a sterile sandy layer (Layer III), which included fragments of the vault of the shelter that collapsed between the two occupations (Barich, 1974). The lower layers (IV and V) showed artifacts similar to those from Ti-n-Torha East, upper layers. However, Layer V at Ti-n-Torha North was dated to 7070 ? 60 b.p. (Barich, 1974), which would be a late date for the Late Acacus. Chronology Table II.

The archaeological deposit corresponding to the Pastoral occupations was probably eroded by the strong erosional activities during the Middle Holocene (Cremaschi, 1998a,b). The beginning of the Pastoral period is supposedly attested to at Uan Muhuggiag by the date of 7400 b.p. However, the majority of dates associ ated with faunal remains of early domesticates are from 6000 b.p. (Gautier, 1987; Cremaschi and di Lernia, 1999a; di Lernia, 1999a; Garcea, 2003a). Climate The climate in the Late Acacus was slightly drier than in the Early Acacus (Tables II and III). Lakes existed until around 8500 b.p., but dried by the end of the ninth millennium b.p. (Cremaschi, 1998b; Cremaschi and di Lernia, 1999a, 2001). Nevertheless, the environmental conditions were substantially similar during the shift from the Early to the Late Acacus (Castelletti et ah, 1999). A more significant change towards aridity occurred during the Late Acacus, as was sedimentologically and stratigraphically at tested to at Uan Tabu from Unit II to Unit I, which are both part of the Late Acacus horizon. Pollen spectra indicated a reduction of the savannah like vegetation and an increase of shrubs, favoring a diversification of the habitats (Mercuri and Trevisan Grandi, 2001; Mercuri and Garcea, 2003). A dry episode is attested to around the middle of the eighth millen nium b.p. Later, between 6400 and 6900 b.p., the climate improved again with wet conditions both in the mountains and the lowlands (Cremaschi and di Lernia, 1998a, 1999a). A wet savannah type of vegetation was identified in both the sediments (Trevisan Grandi et aL, 1995) and the pollen spectra (Mercuri et ah, 1998) in the Messak Settafet plateau and the Tadrart Acacus massif. Animal Exploitation The hunting of wild Barbary sheep predominated in the Early Acacus (Table III). It was reduced to about 45-60% in the Late Acacus and was integrated with smaller taxa, including hare, porcupine, birds, and fish (Corridi, 1998). Barbary sheep and gazelle hunting decreased due to inten sive predation. A longer-term system of exploitation based on delayed and planned consumption was probably developed to compensate for shortages (Gautier, 1987; di Lernia, 1999b, 2001). Animal taming and penning became a common practice in the Late Acacus, as indicated by Barbary sheep kept</page><page sequence="19">Alternative Way Towards Food Production in the Libyan Sahara 125 in enclosures with large accumulations of straw, fodder and dung (di Lernia, 1996,1998,1999b, 2001). The wadi valleys could provide good seasonal grazing, establishing fa vorable prerequisites for animal domestication or adoption of domesticated herds. The exploitation of a broader faunal spectrum in the Late Acacus may have been a reaction to an enduring subsistence crisis, which may have contributed to adopting animal herding (Holl, 1998). During the Pastoral horizon, the faunal assemblage included both cat tle and caprines. At Uan Muhuggiag, lower layers, caprines has a ratio of about 3:1 for cattle. Domesticated sheep prevailed among the caprines (Gautier, 1987). At Ti-n-Torha North, Layers I and II, there were few an imal bones, all belonging to domesticated cattle. No faunal remains were found in the lower layers (Cassoli and Durante, 1974). It is likely that pastoral groups came into the Tadrart Acacus with al ready domesticated herds. The new subsistence strategy could also satisfy economic needs for social diversification (Caneva, 1985, 1999). Pastoral ists regarded their herds as property involving changes in social relations (McDonald, 1998). Food production could provide new forms of wealth, resource accumulation and social differentiation, which could have been desired in the new economic and social systems. Plant Exploitation During the Early Acacus, vegetal resources came from a monotonous savannah-like landscape with a low diversity in plant communities (Table III). They were extensively exploited, but remained abundant and were not reduced by human pressure. Herbs were dominant in the pollen spectra and were mainly harvested for food. No cereal pollen types were recovered in the Early Acacus deposit (Mercuri, 1999, 2001; Mercuri and Trevisan Grandi, 2001; Mercuri and Garcea, 2003). Plant exploitation increased in the Late Acacus. Wild grasses were in tensively collected and used for different purposes. A constant increase in plant exploitation was recorded at Uan Tabu. Unit II, dated to 8800 8900 b.p., indicated that a large spectrum of plant resources was exploited and the accumulation of plants doubled. Unit I showed a higher special ization over a slightly reduced spectrum of plant resources, with an inten sive exploitation of cattails (Typha) (Mercuri and Trevisan Grandi, 2001). Cattails could have been used for food, bedding, weaving, and/or build ing. Cattail stems with flowering spikes were used to make the roof of a wooden hut at Uan Tabu (see below) and twisted cords were also found near the hut. Herbs and grasses were employed for artifacts, grazing, and,</page><page sequence="20">126 Garcea perhaps, medical purposes (Mercuri, 2001). Some tools made of tamarisk wood were found, as well. Gramineae, particularly Paniceae (Brachiaria and Urochloa), were occasionally accumulated at the site. Burned caryopses of Gramineae were only found in the Late Acacus and not before, sug gesting that they were roasted and stored for later consumption (Mercuri, 2001; Mercuri and Garcea, 2003). Charcoal of Tamarix predominated in the earlier fuel resources and was complemented by Chenopodiaceae, namely Calotropis procera in Unit II, and the first scattered tropical elements, such as Salvadora persica and Leptadenia pyrotechnica in Unit I (Neumann and Uebel, 2001). The accumulation of charred plants was interpreted as a shift from short seasonal stays to longer occupations of sites. This also suggested an increase in human pressure (Mercuri, 2001; Mercuri and Garcea, 2003). An increased botanical knowledge allowed the preservation and sur vival of the wild cereals and plants under human care, even when their habi tat was reduced (Mercuri, 2001; Mercuri and Garcea, 2003). It appeared that wild cereals could survive in the Wadi Teshuinat even during a climatic dry phase that could have caused their total disappearance from the area. These grasses survived in the region thanks to both natural and artificial conditions. It is likely that the mountains naturally acted as refugium areas. Furthermore, some specific wild plants could have been artificially cared for by humans (Mercuri, 2001). It has also been inferred that the first stages of the domestication pro cess of Sorghum and Pennisetum, which later spread to the south, may have taken place in the southern Sahara (Neumann, 1999). A few remains of Pen nisetum were found at Uan Tabu (Mercuri, 2001), Ti-n-Torha Two Caves and Uan Muhuggiag (Wasylikowa, 1993). Some plants from the Late Acacus sequence at Uan Tabu appeared to occur in the Pastoral sequence at Uan Muhuggiag. In particular, wild cere als, such as Cenchrus and Digitaria, were found at both sites, suggesting con tinuity in the transmission of the cultural knowledge on plant exploitation from one period to the other (Mercuri, 2001). A similar trend was observed with regard to pollen accumulations of herbs, such as Artemisia and Typha, which were also attested to at Uan Afuda (Mercuri et aL, 1998). It has been observed that at Uan Muhuggiag, in Pastoral times, the number of grass remains is similar to that recorded at prepastoral sites (Wasylikowa, 1993). Spatial Organization A few hearths and a stone alignment, possibly a wind break, were the only evidence of spatial organization in the Early Acacus (di Lernia, 1999b; Garcea, 2001).</page><page sequence="21">Alternative Way Towards Food Production in the Libyan Sahara 127 Fig. 3. A profile of the excavation at Uan Tabu with stone blocks of the hut. A marked intra-site spatial organization appeared as a peculiar feature of the Late Acacus sites (Table III). At Uan Tabu, a wooden hut (Fig. 3) was found in this horizon. A spatial analysis of the artifactual material within the site indicated that some activities were intentionally carried out in the hut area and others outside it (Garcea, 2001). Hearths became another distinctive feature of the Late Acacus (Garcea, 2001). They were the most complex and the largest, reaching over 1 m in diameter and 20-30 cm in thickness at Uan Tabu (Fig. 4). Some of</page><page sequence="22">1A 10 2A 2D i 3A 3D | 4A 4D 5A 5D 0 im, Fig. 4. Sketc ofa thIetr rfl fteecvto tUnTb ihhats</page><page sequence="23">Alternative Way Towards Food Production in the Libyan Sahara 129 them indicated that they were repeatedly used for the same activity over the time (polyphase organizations, according to Taborin, 1989); others sug gested that they were used for different functions (polycyclic organization, according to Wattez, 1996). With regard to the Early/Middle Pastoral period, small hearths were found in some rockshelters in the Tadrart Acacus and a few fireplaces were recorded at open-air sites in the lowlands (Cremaschi and di Lernia, 1998a). Hearth remains were found in the lower layers at Uan Muhuggiag (Barich, 1987). "Stone places," that is, agglomerations of pebbles or rock fragments with traces of fire and some artifacts were recorded throughout the Sahara. They were dated from about 8500 b.p., although they were rare during the ninth millennium b.p., but considerably increased from the mid-eighth mil lennium b.p. (Gabriel, 1987). The presence of rock art in the rockshelters suggests that they could have some symbolic functions, even during the use of the place as house holds (see below). The need of marking the territory by means of perma nent signs, such as rock paintings and engravings, is certainly an important cultural change that occurred in the Late Acacus (di Lernia, 1999b; Garcea, 2003b). Settlement Pattern Early Acacus settlements were spread over different types of land scapes, namely the valleys of the Tadrart Acacus mountain range and the lakes in the lowlands of the Erg Uan Kasa and the Edeyen of Murzuq (Cremaschi and di Lernia, 1998b, 1999a) (Table III). They appeared to be evenly distributed in the different geographic areas, although the mountain sites exhibited a larger surface of occupation and thicker deposits. Sites in the ergs, the sandy lowlands, were smaller and were attributed to single oc cupations. Due to climatic conditions, mountain sites could have been more favorable than erg sites in dry seasons or periods, whereas erg sites were preferentially occupied under more humid conditions. The total number of Late Acacus sites was lower than that of the Early Acacus ones. The only exception was in the Tadrart Acacus moun tain range, where humans concentrated because resources were more abun dant (Cremaschi and di Lernia, 1998a). On the other hand, sites were larger than in the Early Acacus. It has been suggested that more concentrated and more permanent occupations led to a degradation of the landscape (Gautier, 1984; Mercuri, 2001; Mercuri and Garcea, 2003). A population growth seemed to have also been likely (di Lernia, 1996, 1999b; Mercuri, 1999).</page><page sequence="24">130 Garcea Pastoral sites were numerically the most frequent. They occupied all types of landscapes, the mountain ranges of the Tadrart Acacus, the Messak Settafet plateau, and the lowlands in the erg Uan Kasa, the wadi Tanezzuft, and the Edeyen of Murzuq. The frequency of Early/Middle Pastoral sites was particularly high in the mountains of the Tadrart Acacus (Cremaschi and di Lernia, 1998a; di Lernia, 1999a). Mobility The Early Acacus featured a high mobility connected to a high season ally (Table III). Resources were exploited over a wide territory, including the mountains, the plains and the surrounding ranges and plateaus. A circu lating mobility of contemporary sites in different habitats used on a seasonal basis has been postulated (Lieberman, 1993; Garcea, 2001). During the Late Acacus, mobility decreased, although interregional relations and long-distance trade and/or exchange developed. The system shifted to a type of radiating mobility which was organized around base camps that were repeatedly or continuously occupied (Lieberman, 1993; Garcea, 2001). Increased sedentism never led to permanent sedentism in this area, but rather implied a settlement pattern based on an intensive ex ploitation of local resources (cf. Kelly, 1995, for a thorough analysis of the foraging spectrum). It has been suggested that changes towards sedentism were probably related to an increased cultural complexity, large availability of resources, and a trend towards demographic growth (Price and Brown, 1985; di Lernia, 1996,1999b). However, intensive exploitation and popula tion growth probably led to a reduction in available resources as was also attested to the final phase of the Late Acacus. Very high mobility characterized Pastoral settlements. Sites were only briefly and seasonally occupied. The mountain areas were preferred during the dry seasons and the lowlands were occupied in the rest of the year. No madism became the necessary organization to sustain animal food resources based on animal herding. No indications of long-distance trade were at tested to in the material culture or in any other evidence at Uan Tabu (see, for example, Livingstone Smith, 2001). Artifactual Material Pottery was extremely rare in the Early Acacus and became common in the Late Acacus (Table III). It was decorated with impressed rocker stamped techniques producing continuous bands of zigzags, according to</page><page sequence="25">Alternative Way Towards Food Production in the Libyan Sahara 131 Fig. 5. Late Acacus pottery. Caneva's (1987) classification (Fig. 5). Petrographic analyses indicated that Late Acacus pastes included granite, which is not present in the Tadrart Acacus mountain range. Its closest source is in the Tassili n'Ajjer near the Algerian border, about 70 km south-west from the site (Livingstone Smith, 2001). This showed that the Late Acacus pottery was imported and may have not been an ordinary product for domestic use. It has been also sug gested elsewhere that the earliest pottery could be related to concepts of prestige, ownership of stored goods, and social interactions (Close, 1995; Hayden, 1995; Hoopes and Barnett, 1995). Pastoral pottery was completely different from that of the Late Acacus in manufacture, decoration, provenance, and probably function. The sherds</page><page sequence="26">Garcea Fig. 6. Pastoral pottery. collected on the surface at Uan Tabu were locally made (Livingstone Smith, 2001). They were decorated with the alternately pivoting stamp and return techniques (Caneva, 1987) (Fig. 6). This type of pottery was more common than at Late Acacus sites, suggesting that it was used for daily functions related to food processing and consumption. Wooden tools and plant artifacts, like perforators (Fig. 7), baskets and cords (Fig. 8), were only common in the Late Acacus. Baskets have been related to either grain winnowing or storage even in other Mesolithic con texts (Zvelebil, 1994). They were not significant in either the Early Acacus or the Pastoral periods. Polished bone tools, such as perforators (Fig. 9), bevels (Fig. 10), and denticulated tools, were of different types in the Late Acacus (Garcea, 1996b, 2001). Ostrich eggshell beads (Fig. 11), fragments, some of them decorated, (Fig. 12) were typical features of the Late Acacus. Worked cat tle bones were found at Uan Tabu and attributed to the Early Pastoral (Garcea, 2001). Various lithic raw materials, some of them of non-local origin, such as quartzite and flint, were common in the Early Acacus. Microliths were a considerable component in the technological assemblage. Retouched tools</page><page sequence="27">Alternative Way Towards Food Production in the Libyan Sahara 133 Fig. 7. Wooden perforator from Uan Tabu. included important frequencies of endscrapers, perforators, and burins (Fig. 13). The Late Acacus lithic technocomplex mainly consisted of generic formal tools on local sandstone. They were on macroflakes, comprising notches, denticulates and sidescrapers (Fig. 14). This suggested activities that probably required longer time of processing, preparing and manufac turing food and secondary products, which were not directly related to ob taining food, but were seemingly used for scraping, cutting, scratching, etc. (Garcea, 2001). The lithic technology did not basically change from the Late Acacus to the Early/Middle Pastoral. The only innovation in the latter was the production of arrowheads (Garcea, 2004). Polished stone tools were largely produced during the Late Acacus. Wild cereal grinding was probably common. Grindstones were also used Fig. 8. Cord from the hut at Uan Tabu.</page><page sequence="28">Fig. 9. Polished bone perforators from Uan Tabu. Fig. 10. Polished bone tools from Uan Tabu.</page><page sequence="29">Alternative Way Towards Food Production in the Libyan Sahara 135 Fig. 11. Ostrich eggshell beads from Uan Tabu. for pounding ochre (Figs. 15 and 16) and other coloring materials probably used for rock paintings (Garcea, 2001). Polished stone tools were not very important in Pastoral times. At Uan Muhuggiag, handstones were the most common type. Lower grind ing stones, smoothing implements, tablets, axes, and grooved stones were present, but were extremely rare. Polishing was often limited to a portion of the artifacts (Barich, 1987). No burials were found at Uan Tabu. However, one burial was un earthed at Uan Muhuggiag Wadi. The tomb exhibited two sub-circular stone structures. The head lay on a stone and two slabs covered the body (di Lernia and Manzi, 1998). No evidence for funerary practices was attested to in the Early Acacus. Rock Art Several paintings are still visible on the central part of the wall of the Uan Tabu rockshelter. The main representation shows a herd of cat tle (Fig. 17) that was attributed to the Pastoral phase (Mori, 1965). This painting is partially superimposed on the top of an earlier one depicting an anthropomorphic figure (Fig. 18) that has been attributed to the so-called Round Head phase (Mori, 1965). Another anthropomorphic figure, in a worse state of preservation, appears on the right side (for a detailed review of the rock art, see Mori, 1998). Rock paintings belonging to the so-called Round Head phase may be related to the Late Acacus (Garcea, 1998a; di Lernia, 1999b). They</page><page sequence="30">136 Garcea Fig. 12. Ostrich eggshell fragments from Uan Tabu. are the earliest paintings in the Saharan rock art, and Round Head fig ures are the earliest anthropomorphic representations (Mori, 1965, 1998). Anthropomorphic images can be found represented with Barbary sheep, confirming humans' very close relations to these animals (di Lernia, 1999b). Pastoral paintings partly covered the Round Head anthropomorphic figures at Uan Tabu, which is an exceptional finding in the Saharan rock art. In fact, they provided an important relative chronology indicating that Round Head paintings are earlier than Pastoral ones.</page><page sequence="31">Alternative Way Towards Food Production in the Libyan Sahara 137 Fig. 13. Early Acacus retouched tools from Uan Tabu. According to Cauvin (1997), the "praying" anthropomorphic figures with up-lifted arms introduce a relationship of subordination that is un known in previous periods. They seem to appear just before the adoption of a food producing organization, but do not continue after them. This is also confirmed in the Saharan rock art. The style following the Round Head, the so-called Pastoral, often depicts scenes of cattle herds, as shown, for example, at Uan Tabu. FOOD PRODUCTION IN NORTHERN AFRICA The beginnings of food production in northern Africa have been often assimilated with those in the Near East. This has produced a number of as sumptions that were inferred from Near Eastern archaeological records, but not proven by local data and, therefore, biased their interpretation. More critical approaches, based on thorough field research carried out in various</page><page sequence="32">Garcea Fig. 14. Late Acacus retouched tools from Uan Tabu. parts of northern Africa, demonstrated that this area followed distinct path ways towards food production. One of the main differences from the Near East and the north-western Mediterranean basin is that agriculture was not the primary form of food production and was even never practised in most of northern Africa during the Early and Middle Holocene. Early farming activities were only prac tised in the northernmost part of Egypt, which was the only area of northern Africa comparable to the Near East. On the other hand, several human ef forts to increase predictability of wild crops were widely practiced with cul tivation which reached the predomesticated stage without passing beyond</page><page sequence="33">Alternative Way Towards Food Production in the Libyan Sahara 139 Fig. 15.

Even the early attempts at sorghum cultivation, which are only attested to in the Egyptian Western Desert, at Nabta Playa around 8000 b.p., did not reach the domestication stage (Close and Wendorf, 1992; Wasylikowa and Dahlberg, 1999). Instead of agriculture, nomadic pastoralism was the most success ful form of food production in most of northern Africa. Attempts at an imal domestication might have been practised on several species, such as Barbary sheep, gazelle, hartebeest, oryx, etc. Several archaeological Fig. 16. Fragments of ochre from Uan Tabu.</page><page sequence="34">140 Garcea</page><page sequence="35">Alternative Way Towards Food Production in the Libyan Sahara 141 sites yielded evidence for extensive exploitation and penning especially of Barbary sheep. Nevertheless, cattle and caprines provided the most successful results in domestication as they are herd animals, and there fore would have been easier to manage. Furthermore, they could pro vide fair amounts of fat, which was a much appreciated resource (Smith, 1992b). Cattle were the first animals to be domesticated. The earliest cattle herding in northern Africa was independent from Near Eastern influences, as there was their endemic wild progenitor, the North African aurochs (Bos primigenius), which lived in the Maghreb and in the Nile valley. Due to climatic conditions, aurochs could not live in the central and western Sahara (Chenal-V61ard6,1997) and, therefore, cattle reached the central Sahara in their tamed form. In the Egyptian eastern Sahara, domesticated cattle dated from the mid-tenth/early ninth millennium b.p., which is much earlier than the time when domesticated herds reached the southern Levant from south-eastern Anatolia, in the seventh millennium b.p. It is only in this later period that the southern Levant acted as a corridor to Africa. Sheep and goat had no wild ancestral species living in the African continent and en tered northern Africa from the Near East. Thus, domesticated sheep and goat came from the southern Levant beginning from the eighth millen nium b.p. and reached different northern African areas. Sheep/goat herd ing appeared in the eastern Sahara at the beginning of the seventh mil lennium b.p. and in coastal northern Africa in the course of the seventh millennium b.p. Ultimately, pottery production started under different conditions than in the Near East. In the eastern Sahara, pottery appeared together with do mesticated cattle, whereas, in the rest of northern Africa, it was produced since prepastoral times and, in the central Sahara, predated animal herd ing by at least 2000 years. The production of pottery was associated with a reduced mobility which characterized the latest northern African foragers. Therefore, its production was reversed in comparison to the Near East. As a matter of fact, pottery, which was considered as the original "Neolithic" guide fossil, was only the last link of the process in the Near East (Aurenche and Kozlowski, 1999), whereas it was one of the first ones in most of the Sahara and the Maghreb. The Near Eastern model is certainly fascinating but it is supported by an amount of data that are missing elsewhere, and, therefore, it cannot be extended to the entire Old World. Many other examples (e.g. Rowley Conwy, 1983; Price and Brown, 1985; Binder, 1991; Peterkin et al, 1993) show that different pathways led to food production in other parts of the Old World.</page><page sequence="36">142 Garcea ALTERNATIVE PATTERNS TO FOOD PRODUCTION Recent findings in the Libyan Sahara provided new evidence that con tributed to clarification of distinctive pathways preceding and following food production. Several economic and cultural events took place before animal domestication and pastoralism were fully adopted. These transfor mations are attested to in the archaeological records of the Early and the Late Acacus cultural horizons. Barbary sheep was the only local wild caprine present in the Libyan Sahara. Its management and taming started in the Early Acacus (8800 9800 b.p.), as is indicated by several colluviation phases in the archaeologi cal deposits rich in organic matter and coprolites of caprine ruminants, and by thick accumulations of dung layers and plant remains (Cremaschi and Trombino, 1999, 2001). Barbary sheep domestication was never successful, but probably led to incipient taming. Smith (1992b) has suggested that this species may have produced hybrid forms with goats. However, it remained rather insignificant and later could not compete with fully domesticated caprines. Together with the use of a broad spectrum of animal resources and Barbary sheep taming, exploitation was extended to a large number of wild plant-species that were cultivated without being domesticated. Many attempts may have been first made and later abandoned, such as the care of Boraginaceae and Urochloa. These plants could grow or increase their reproduction in certain ecological niches only thanks to human skills (Mercuri, 2001; Mercuri and Garcea, 2003). The storage of vegetable food was also an important cultural and eco nomic change that was attested to in the prepastoral period, as indicated in the Late Acacus. Storing food permitted maximal exploitation of resources that were only periodically, or seasonally, available and to extend the pe riod of duration and consumption of the resources. This practice required developing a specific technology for food preserving and processing. The re sult could have produced a surplus that had never been available before. As a consequence, the social factors of storing did not only concern the need to develop alliance networks due to the requirements of extra labor during foraging, preservation and protection after foraging. They could also have involved unequal accumulation of resources, providing varying prestige and status, as suggested for other contexts (Rowley-Conwy and Zvelebil, 1989). The shift to the food producing economy did not seem to be contempo raneous in the various northern African regions. Independent adoption of pastoralism at different loci in the Sahara, instead of its gradual expansion, has been postulated (Smith, 1992b). The earliest date of cattle from the cen tral Sahara comes from Libya, where it may date from the end of the eighth</page><page sequence="37">Alternative Way Towards Food Production in the Libyan Sahara 143 millennium b.p., although this chronology is based on a radiocarbon date obtained in the 1960s. In the rest of the central Sahara, pastoralism dates from the end of the seventh millennium/beginning of the sixth millennium b.p. At this time the adoption of animal herding became widespread and systematic, possibly due to a later input of domestic species in the Sahara, which, by then, included both domesticated cattle and caprines. It has been suggested that cattle spread from the central Sahara to the west, to the south, into the Sahel, and to the upper Sudanese Nile valley (Gautier, 1987). An eastward shift from the Sahara to the upper Nile valley was also confirmed by pottery. The production of the typical Saharan ware decorated with dotted-wavy line motifs was introduced into the upper Nile valley from the Sahara, as shown by its earlier chronology in the Sahara than in the Nile valley (Garcea, 1998b). Environmental reasons could explain the delayed spread of pastoral ism in the interior of northern Africa. In fact, a climatic deterioration oc curred in the Sahara at the end of the ninth millennium b.p. and probably caused a depopulation of the area. Around 7000 b.p., environmental con ditions improved again and human occupation first increased in the most favorable areas, where water was available. The animal repopulation fol lowed a similar trend bringing animal resources closer to human settlements (Clark, 1980). As a consequence, the already acquired skills of controlling and taming wild species under dry climatic conditions (Klein and Scott, 1986) developed towards controlled reproduction with a modification of the gene pool. Domestic sheep and goat reached the central Sahara at the end of the seventh/beginning of the sixth millennium b.p. and spread all over the Sahara. When pastoralism was fully adopted, intensive wild-plant exploitation was not abandoned. Rather, a mixed economy integrating domesticated animals and intensified collection of wild plants seemed to be particularly successful in the semiarid regions of different parts of Africa (see, among others, Layton et a/., 1991; Sadr, 1991; Smith, 1992b, 1998). This was linked to climatic changes and implied the development of different social net works, as well as technological innovations and skills to identify the most suitable resources for intensive husbandry. The Tadrart Acacus is certainly a marginal area with respect to the cen ters of domestication, being over 2000 km from the Egyptian oases of the eastern Sahara and even farther from the Nile river. Yet, if it is true that we need to study the processes that precede the emergence of domestication in order to understand their real economic and cultural meaning, the Tadrart Acacus displays a very detailed pattern of successful adaptation to an en vironment that has been often adverse to human existence and, therefore, forced the groups living there to develop rather complex techniques of care</page><page sequence="38">144 Garcea and exploitation of the few resources that were available. This organization successfully increased resource predictability and could be integrated in the pastoral economy.
