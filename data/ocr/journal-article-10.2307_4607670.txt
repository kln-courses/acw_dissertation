<plain_text><page sequence="1">Crowell, Marnie Reed. GREAT BLUE: THE ODYSSEY OF A GREAT BLUE HERON. New York: Times Books; 1980, 143 pp., illus. $10.95. Although the great blue heron is still a fairly common bird in North America, few who see it can resist the urge to pause and admire its stately grace as it stalks the shallows hunting for food, or sweeps along the horizon on long, lazy wings. Usually shy and solitary, there is an air of mystery about this great bird-the largest heron on the continent-that makes us wonder about its place in the order of natural things. How does it live and reproduce? Where does it go when it isn't here? In Great Blue: The Odyssey of a Great Blue Heron, Marnie Reed Crowell tells the story of one such bird from the time it hatches on an island off the coast of Maine to its return there the following season after a migration of more than 5,000 miles. The extent of Great Blue's travels during that year is enough to make a budding naturalist-or anyone else for that matter-green with envy. Ber- muda, the Sargasso Sea, Trinidad, the West Indies, and the Ever- glades of Florida are all ports of call. As the author recounts the bird's adventures on this trip, stepping delicately around the dangers of anthropomorphism, she also tells a great deal about the habits of this species and those of other herons as well. More than that, she talks a great deal about many kinds of wildlife encountered along the way: birds, whales, fish, frogs, in-</page><page sequence="2">88 Bios sects, and plants are all woven into the fabric of her narrative. As a matter of fact, it becomes apparent before the reader is halfway through this book that although the story of the heron's first migra- tion is the central theme, the author has really used Great Blue's wings to take the reader on an entirely different kind of journey, one that explores the impact of man on nature, whether it be the efforts to save endangered species in Bermuda, the dumping of pol- lutants into the fabulous Caroni Swamp of Trinidad, or inadver- tently setting deadly bird traps with the cast off plastic rings of six- pack carriers in the Everglades. Informative and well written, my only criticism of this book is that it tries to cover too much in one slim volume. Each time that I have been fortunate enough to visit the Caroni Swamp, for instance, the trip has always seemed far too brief. I felt the same way when I visited it again in the pages of this book and wanted the author to stay a while longer and get a closer look at the potoo, the spinetails and the four-eyed fish. I hope that she plans to make more extended visits to these places in future works. Joseph Bell Department of Ornithology New York Zoological Society Bronx, NY 10460</page></plain_text>
