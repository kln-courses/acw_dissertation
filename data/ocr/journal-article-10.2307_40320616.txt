<plain_text><page sequence="1">Design and Chance: the Evolution of Peirce's Evolutionary Cosmology1 Christopher Hookway 1. Introduction In 1886, Peirce wrote: We must... suppose an element of absolute chance, sporting, spontaneity, originality, freedom in nature. We must further suppose that this element in the ages of the past was indefi- nitely more prominent than now, and that the present al- most exact conformity to law is something that has been gradually brought about... If the universe is thus progress- ing from a state of all but pure chance to a state of all but complete determination by law, we must suppose that there is an original elemental tendency of things to acquire deter- minate properties, to take habits. This is the third or medi- ating element between chance, which brings forth First and original events, and law which produces sequences or Sec- onds... [T]his tendency must itself have been gradually evolved; and it would evidently tend to strengthen itself... Here then is a rational physical hypothesis, which is calcu- lated to account, or all but account for everything in the universe except pure originality itself. (W5: 293) This passage outlines a metaphysical programme which Peirce developed in a series of six papers published in The Monist between 1890 and 1893. It offers a general account of the universe, finding pattern in its development and overall structure. This pattern is of an Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society Winter, 1997, Vol. XXXIII, No. 1</page><page sequence="2">2 Christopher Hookway evolutionary structure: Peirce's approach combines his "tychistic" insistence on the importance of absolute chance with an appeal to a tendency to "take habits" or to reinforce chance patterns. For some early commentators, the whole idea of a Peircean system of meta- physics was a puzzling embarrassment. Since his pragmatism resembled the verificationism of the logical positivists, and was credited with disposing of "ontological metaphysics", such metaphysical specula- tions seemed anomalous. Although we now recognize that Peirce's own metaphysics was supposed to be "scientific" and empirically grounded (and was thus expected to avoid pragmatic criticism), there are still some deep puzzles about its role in Peirce's thought2. This paper examines the emergence of these cosmological ideas in Peirce's writings: why did he suddenly start addressing these topics some twenty years after his first philosophical publications appeared? We might explain Peirce's new interest in metaphysics by appeal to external factors. As Nathan Houser has noted, Peirce's energies turned to metaphysics after his professional duties at Johns Hopkins came to an end: perhaps he now had time to pursue interests that his professional obligations had previously distracted him from. He may also have supposed that a reputation as a metaphysician would im- prove his chances of university employment. Joseph Brent has emphasised that Peirce's interest in "different manifestations of the real" was stimulated by his father's lectures on Ideality in the Physical World, delivered in Baltimore in 1880 (p.204f); and Max Fisch has traced the form taken by the metaphysics to Peirce's intensive read- ing of Aristotle and Hellenic philosophy in the early 1880s (1986, ch 12.). But this cannot be the whole story. As late as 1878, his attitude towards such cosmological endeavours was ambivalent: if it were pos- sible to construct one, this would be of great philosophical and logi- cal interest, but it was rational to be sceptical about the feasibility of doing so. So perhaps exposure to his father's writings or to Greek philosophy enabled Peirce to overcome what had previously seemed to be insuperable problems. Or perhaps problems internal to his work in logic made it important at least to hope that these metaphysical questions could be answered. Murray Murphey has argued that the</page><page sequence="3">The Evolution of Peirce's Evolutionary Costnolojjy 3 new logical discoveries of the early 1880s required revisions in his theory of categories which in turn made it necessary to construct a system of evolutionary cosmology. He has also suggested that Peirce's theory of inquiry ran into problems which could only be met with the aid of these metaphysical doctrines. In a similar vein, Karl-Otto Apel argues that metaphysics was required to rescue Peirce's account of reality. Are there questions which became pressing for Peirce in the early 1880s which can only be answered with the aid of a system of metaphysics? Our best source for understanding the origins of Peirce's meta- physics lies in some unpublished papers which prefigure the views published in The Monist. The most important texts are: (1) "Design and Chance" (1884): a manuscript which was used as the basis of a talk to the Metaphysical Club at Johns Hopkins University. (W4:544-554) (2) "An American Plato" (1885): a review of Josiah Royce's Religious Aspects of Philosophy^ commissioned by the editor of the Popular Science Monthly who declined to publish it. (W5:221-234) (3) "One, Two, Three: Kantian Categories" (1886): some drafts towards a systematic treatment of Peirce's categories. (W5:292-302) (4) "A Guess at the Riddle" (1887-88): an extended manuscript, developing Peirce's theory of categories.3 We must also take account of the 1878 paper mentioned above: (5) "The Order of Nature": published in the Popular Science Monthly as the fifth of the "Illustrations of the Logic of Science."(W3:306-322) Some of the key arguments of this paper are repeated in "A Theory of Probable Inference" (W4:408-450), published in 1883, a year be- fore "Design and Chance" was delivered.</page><page sequence="4">4 Christopher Hookway In his introduction to volume five of Writings of 'Charles S Peirce, Nathan Houser emphasizes that Peirce's metaphysical ideas devel- oped throughout this period, his full metaphysical vision not being in place until "A Guess at the Riddle". The papers contain develop- ments of two kinds. In "Design and Chance", the main focus is on the introduction of evolutionary ideas into logic and metaphysics: Peirce sketched an evolutionary explanation of laws which claimed that the universe had become more regular and law governed through time, and this was refined in some of the later papers. In addition, especially in "A Guess at the Riddle", Peirce developed a "long list of categories". Where earlier discussions of the three categories had con- centrated upon their role in logic and semiotic, Peirce now began to trace the characteristic forms of firstness, secondness and thirdness in metaphysics, psychology, physiology, biology, physics, sociology and theology. These two themes both form part of Peirce's evolving meta- physical system, but my main interest here is with his insistence that a metaphysical cosmology should have an evolutionary structure. After noting some of Peirce's early remarks about the current state of metaphysics and its prospects (section 2), we introduce some themes in the development of Peirce's thought during the late 1870s and 1880s. Section 3 contrasts Peirce's pessimism about the possi- bility of finding a characterization of the universe in general in 1878 with his attempt to develop one just six years later, and section 4 chronicles his growing stress upon the role of innate ideas over the same period. This is followed by an attempt to analyze the chief argument for Peirce's metaphysics, which is linked to his insistence that we should doubt the absolute truth of fundamental logical and metaphysical axioms. The final two sections discuss how far pres- sures facing the theory of inquiry Peirce had developed during the 1870s forced him to address these metaphysical questions. 2. Peirce and Metaphysics before 1884 Although Peirce had happily called himself a metaphysician since the 1860s, his early writings contain many negative remarks about the subject. A typical example is a footnote to "On the Natural Classifi-</page><page sequence="5">The Evolution ofPeirce's Evolutionary Cosmology 5 cation of Arguments" (1867), which records that "almost all men think that metaphysical theories are valueless, because metaphysicians disagree so much among themselves" (W2: 45n). Such remarks did not reflect a positivist rejection of a whole area of knowledge. His aim, rather, was to lament the poor state of contemporary metaphysi- cal writing, and to attribute it to the assumption that an a priori sys- tem of metaphysics was a possibility: "It is of no avail that philoso- phers adopt strictly demonstrative forms of argument as long as they cannot, after all, come to agreement on conclusions" (W2:187). He also criticized the widespread belief that metaphysics could contrib- ute to our understanding of practical (especially religious) matters4. In this section we shall note some of his early claims about how meta- physical inquiry should be carried out. The business of metaphysics, Peirce later wrote (in 1903), "is to study the most general features of reality and real objects" (CP 6.6)} The early remarks we shall look at will concern the means to be employed in such a study. Peirce's pessimism about progress in metaphysics has limits. In- deed, due to the clarification of various "indistinct conceptions", dis- agreement has diminished over the centuries (W2:127). His attack on a priori approaches to metaphysics in 'Potentia ex Impotentia' (1868), leads to the suggestion that progress will depend upon using "hypothetic and inductive reasoning" (W2:187). But in the 1860s he was sceptical that there would be rapid progress even if the scientific method were employed: the current state of metaphysics reflected its immaturity: Every great branch of science has once been in the state which metaphysics is now, that is when its fundamental concep- tions were vague and consequently its doctrines utterly un- settled; and there is no reason whatever to despair of meta- physics eventually becoming a real science like the rest; but at present that is not the case. (W2:127) Suggesting that "dynamics just before the time of Galileo was in a state not dissimilar to that in which philosophy now is", he recom- mended that:</page><page sequence="6">6 Christopher Hookway If metaphysics has the happy future before it which dynam- ics then had, it must be content to rest upon tangible exter- nal facts and to begin with theories not supported by any great multitude of different considerations or held with ab- solute confidence. When these first theories have been sys- tematically traced to their consequences, we can see how many facts they serve to explain, and which are the ones that re- quire to be retained. (W2:188). So metaphysics should be investigated using the method of science, but, in the 1860s, was in a rather primitive "pre-Galilean" state. By the 1880s, Peirce was more confident that he saw the way ahead. There is a second theme in Peirce's early responses to "meta- physics". In 1865 and 1866, lecturing on "The Logic of Science" he claimed to follow Kant and Aristotle in accepting "the Analytic of Logic is the foundation of metaphysics." (W:302, 1865); he endorsed the view "of several great thinkers" that progress in these areas re- quires "adopting our logic as our metaphysics" (Wl:490). Bearing in mind the claim that metaphysics aims to describe the most general features of reality, we can understand these claims by recalling Kant's metaphysical deduction of his categories. Since reality is what is de- scribed in a true proposition, an account of the general formal fea- tures of propositions - an account of their logical forms - will tell us about the most general features of reality. This theme appears to be in conflict with the first: it suggests that metaphysics should be an a priori discipline rather than one which employs the method of science. But this is only appearance. First, Peirce would probably have advocated the use of observation and experiment in contrasting logical systems and in deriving systems of categories from them. Second, the questions discussed in metaphys- ics are not exhausted by the search for a system of categories, and, as we shall see, there are more complex and indirect ways in which logic can guide our inquiries in metaphysics. In his later work, for example, we discover that one task of metaphysics is to provide a scientific account of reality which explains the truth of various propositions</page><page sequence="7">The Evolution ofPeirce's Evolutionary Cosmology 7 that logic adopts as regulative ideals or hopes. Although the meta- physics of the 1880s is clearly intended to be empirical and scientific, Peirce often emphasizes that it grows out of his work in logic. 3. The Order of Nature "The Order of Nature" (1878), the fifth of Peirce's "Illustrations of the Logic of Science," examines some broad questions about the na- ture of reality which are clearly relevant to the metaphysical writings of half a decade later. The introductory section alludes to the tradi- tional argument from design for the reality of God: the only evidence we could imagine for the reality of God, he supposes, would arise out of "the universal subjection of phenomena to laws" or out of "the character of those laws themselves" (as being benevolent, beautiful, economical etc.) (W3:306). Peirce himself supposed that religion does not require grounding in "evidences" of this kind, and indeed found religious belief which was so supported rather distasteful. But he re- tained an interest in whether there was any "general characteristic of the universe" because, if there was, it "would be of such singular assistance to us in all our future reasoning, that it would deserve a place almost at the head of the principles of logic" (W3: 307). So there are logical reasons for investigating: "what sort of conception we ought to have of the universe": "how to think of the ensemble of things, is a fundamental problem in the theory of reasoning." This issue - in the form of the question whether there is "a general plan or design embracing the whole universe" - is taken further in the final section of the paper. Peirce supposed that there could be such a plan only if the material universe was "of limited extent and finite age." If it is infinite, in time or space, then "there is no whole of material things, and consequently no general character to the universe" (W3:319). If, on the other hand, "there are certain absolute bounds to the region of things outside of which there is mere void, then we naturally seek for an explanation of it, and, since we cannot look for it among material things, the hypothesis of a great disembodied animal, the creator and governor of the world, is natu- ral enough". According to Peirce, "The universe ought to be pre-</page><page sequence="8">8 Christopher Hookway sumed to be too vast to have any character." It is rational to be preju- diced against general cosmologies which account for the universe as a whole - especially if they purport to explain the universe in non- mechanical terms. Once again, note "important questions of Iqgic" (my italics) depend upon whether the universe is bounded or not. 'General plan or design' is a vague phrase, but it is reasonable to suppose that Peirce's scepticism about this idea soon diminished. In- deed the cosmological views we saw expressed at the beginning of this paper suggest that the universe is not too vast to have a general char- acter: indeed, it has directions and limits in time and space. More- over, by the time he wrote "An American Plato", his view of God was, not of a "great disembodied animal", but clearly linked to his cosmo- logical ideas. Discussing Royce's view that the real existence of God consists in his imaging or positing Himself, he continues: For my part, I hold another theory, which I intend to take an early opportunity of putting into print. I think that the existence of God, as well as we can conceive it, consists in this, that a tendency toward ends is so necessary a constitu- ent of the universe that the mere action of chance upon in- numerable atoms has an inevitable teleological result. One of the ends so brought about is the development of intelli- gence and of knowledge; and therefore I should say that God's omniscience, humanly conceived, consists in the fact that knowledge in its development leaves no question unan- swered. (W5:229) Belief in God, then, goes together with confidence in a kind of progress or development in human life and inquiry. The evolutionary cos- mology (with its appeal, on occasion, to the "mere action of chance") is plainly of a piece with this account of religious belief. Our question about the relations between the evolutionary cosmology and Peirce's logical views then becomes, in the light of these views, a question about the logical significance of this "cosmic optimism." In view of the last sentence of the quoted passage, this will presumably concern</page><page sequence="9">The Evolution of Peirce's Evolutionary Cosmology 9 the logical significance of the claim that "knowledge in its develop- ment leaves no question unanswered". One focus of Peirce's review of Royce is the latter's criticisms of a view of reality which is recognisable as Peirce's own. This is the view that: Reality, the fact that there is such a thing as a true answer to a question, consists in this: that human inquiries, - human reasoning and observation, - tend toward the settlement of disputes and ultimate agreement in definite conclusions which are independent of the particular stand-points from which the different inquirers may have set out; so that the real is that which any man would believe in, and be ready to act upon, if his investigations were to be carried sufficiently far. (W5:222) One plausible interpretation of Peirce's argument views it as an at- tempt to show that his conception of reality is compatible with a religious outlook that finds room for God's omniscience. It is re- quired to block objections which challenge this conception of reality by suggesting that things may be knowable to God which could never be a matter of unforced consensus among human inquirers. This does not provide a very strong argument in favour of Peirce's evolu- tionary cosmology. Indeed the text of "An American Plato" strongly suggests that the cosmological picture is supported by other argu- ments, not stated here. However we do receive strong confirmation for the view that these ideas are linked to problems with Peirce's account of reality. The older view of God's omniscience tended to think of the limits and fallibility of our knowledge by contrasting it with the information available to this omniscient God. Once the evolutionary cosmology is in place, Peirce is able to describe our lim- its and fallibility in terms that are internal to the process of human inquiry: our beliefs are measured against what would be believed after sufficient inquiry.</page><page sequence="10">10 Christopher Hookway 4. Innate Ideas Some philosophers have turned to the uniformity to be found in nature in order to find a premise from which they can demonstrate various conclusions from the existence of God to the soundness of inductive reasoning. According to a much discussed argument in "The Order of Nature", this premise is too trivial to yield such interesting conclusions: even a wholly chance world would be uniform. More significant, Peirce argues, is the fact that there are regularities which are salient to our senses and intelligence, and relevant to our con- cerns6. It is not interesting that nature is uniform; but it is that we can discover what these regularities are. It is easy to imagine a world gov- erned by regularities which were so recondite, so remote from our everyday concerns, that the prospects of their being discovered were close to zero. Peirce illustrates this by an example. Having completed a statistical induction, for example that one half of all births are of male children, we can search for a description of which births are of male children. He supposes that one can always be found: this reflects the principle that every event must have a cause. But, he continues: [I]f there be nothing to guide us to the discovery; if we have to hunt among all the events in the world without any scent; if for instance, the sex of the child might equally be sup- posed to depend upon the configuration of the planets, on what was going on at the antipodes, or on anything else - then the discovery would have no chance of every being made. (W3:317)7 It is then a short step to being impressed by the ease with which human beings (and even animals) arrive at extremely sophisticated and complex concepts and hypotheses: space, time and force are of- fered as examples, and then to concluding that such concepts must be innate. Peirce does just this, proposing that the innateness of concepts like space, time and force is due to natural selection: crea- tures with such concepts would possess great advantages in the struggle for life.</page><page sequence="11">The Evolution of Petrels Evolutionary Cosmology 1 1 This notion of "innateness" covers a range of phenomena. As well as concepts such as Space which "take possession of the mind on small provocation", it is also required to account for the fact that some concepts and hypotheses, which are not themselves produced in us by natural selection, appeal to our sense of plausibility or sim- plicity. Peirce uses Gravity as an example of a concept which "the mind is particularly adapted to apprehend with facility". In general: [T]he mind of man is strongly adapted to the comprehen- sion of the world; at least, so far as this goes, that certain conceptions, highly important for such a comprehension, naturally arise in his mind; and, without such a tendency, the mind could never have had any development at all. (W3: 318) Peirce seems to be convinced that such an innate aptitude is re- quired to explain the possibility of science: unless we possessed it, progress in science would be so slow as to be indiscernible. But he is aware that natural selection cannot account for all of the innate pre- dispositions which guide scientific inquiry. Since it is implausible that natural selection would favour creatures well equipped to be good at the most abstract theoretical physics, "it is probable that there is some secret here which remains to be discovered" (W3: 319). The cosmic optimism grounded in an evolutionary cosmology which posits addi- tional mechanisms of evolutionary change besides natural selection has a role in his attempt to probe this secret. In a version of "One, Two, Three" written in the summer of 1885, a related appeal to innateness is used to motivate the search for a "long list" of categories.. After offering the logical analyses of signs and arguments which he had long used to defend his categories, Peirce concludes that "the whole organism of logic may be mentally evolved from the three conceptions of first, second, and third...," (W5:245). He continues: But if these three conceptions enter as we find they do as elements of all conceptions connected with reasoning, they</page><page sequence="12">12 Christopher Hookway must be virtually in the mind when reasoning first com- mences. In that sense, at least, they must be innate ideas; and consequently they must be capable of explanation, psy- chologically; - there must be in the consciousness three fac- ulties corresponding to these three categories of logic... We can ignore the details of his demonstration that "the true categories of consciousness" are i) consciousness of quality, ii) con- sciousness of an interruption into the field of consciousness and iii) synthetic consciousness. These, he insists, "afford a psychological ex- planation of the three logical conceptions of quality, relation and syn- thesis or mediation" (W5:246). But we should notice his immediate observation that "Three such fundamental elements of conscious- ness must be capable of a psychological explanation from three fun- damental properties of the nervous system" (W5:247 - the manu- script comes to an end in unfinished speculation about the behaviour of cells). Although nothing in this passage introduces the evolution- ary cosmology, it is significant that - for the first time in his writings - Peirce's reflections on his categories lead from logic to psychology and physiology on the basis of considerations about explanation. Peirce tells us that the three categories (and our grasp of them) must receive such explanations: if our grasp of the categories is not "in- nate", they must be inferred from something more fundamental, in which case the categories would not be truly fundamental. The 'must' here suggests that unless such explanations are forthcoming, Peirce's arguments for his logical categories would be unsatisfactory. These two uses of innateness are both concerned with explana- tion: we can only explain why people have concepts such as Space, Time and the Categories by appealing to structures which are innate in the mind. But they are crucially different in a way that ensures that the innateness of the categories must receive a "metaphysical" expla- nation. Peirce agrees with Berkeley that the concepts of Space and Time are acquired through inference. The focus of his puzzlement is that these complex concepts are acquired so easily, even by those of little education or by animals. The task is to explain why our inductive</page><page sequence="13">The Evolution of Peirce's Evolutionary Cosmology 13 habits lead us to favour some hypotheses so strongly and so unreflectively. The case of the categories is different. Since these concepts are fundamental and are involved in all inference and inquiry, it would be absurd to see our knowledge of them as the result of inference and inquiry. If we acquire them on the basis of an inference from some- thing else, then they are not manifested, as he supposes they are, in the different forms of inference. Once we are capable of reflective inference, on Peirce's view, we already possess the categories. They must be present as forms of the mind, as forms of understanding. Metaphysics must explain the correctness of our rational hope that the categories reflected in the forms of the mind will fit reality. This explains why Peirce believes that, having traced and identified the role of the categories within mental phenomena, he must continue to explore the forms they take in biology, physics and metaphysics. The developing theory of categories is meeting an explanatory demand: a confidence in our skills as investigators depends upon our trust that we are attuned to the structure of reality, and we must explain why and how this can be so.8 5. Doubting the Exact Truth of Axioms The earliest paper which is a clear ancestor of Peirce's evolutionary metaphysics was given to the Metaphysical Club at Johns Hopkins in 1884: "Design and Chance"9. It will be useful to begin with a sketch of its contents. Peirce mentions two fundamental characteristics of the intellectual life of the time at which he was writing: Darwin's work and "the tendency to question the exact truth of axioms" (W4: 544). And he expresses the view that the development of this second idea in mathematics, science and philosophy is "likely to teach us more than any other general conception." Having mentioned some uses already made of this idea, especially in non-Euclidean geometry, he continues: What I propose to do tonight is, following the lead of those mathematicians who question whether the sum of the angles</page><page sequence="14">14 Christopher Hookway of a triangle is exactly equal to two right angles, to call in question the perfect accuracy of a fundamental law of logic. Related comments occur in "One, Two, Three: Kantian Categories": This is the day for doubting axioms. With mathematicians, the question is settled; there is no reason to believe that the geometrical axioms are exactly true. Metaphysics is an imi- tation of geometry, and with the geometrical axioms the metaphysical axioms must go too. (W5:292, 1886) The "metaphysical axiom" questioned in "One, Two, Three" is iden- tical to the "logical axiom" of "Design and Chance". In 1884, Peirce offers four formulations which are not obviously equivalent. i) Real things exist. (W4:545) ii) Every intelligible question whatever is susceptible in its own nature of receiving a definitive and satisfactory answer, if it be sufficiently investigated by observation and reasoning. (W4:545-46) (This is Peirce's preferred formulation.) iii) "In Mill's formulation": Nature is uniform (W4:546) iv) Every event has a cause. (W4:546)10. The 1886 formulation is: v) Every thing that happens is completely determined by exact laws. (W5:293)The earlier paper also cites v) as a corollary of the more basic principle: vi) Every fact has an explanation, a reason. The consequence of denying these fundamental logical principles is the admission that "chance, in the Aristotelian sense, mere absence of cause, has to be admitted as having some slight place in the universe" (W4:547).</page><page sequence="15">The Evolution ofPeirce's Evolutionary Cosmology 15 As before, it will be useful to begin with "The Order of Nature", where Peirce enunciated a "logical principle" involved in our induc- tive practice: When we have drawn any statistical induction - such, for instance, as that one-half of all births are of male children - it is always possible to discover, by investigation sufficiently prolonged, a class of which the same predicate may be af- firmed universally; to find out, for instance, what sorts of births are of male children. The truth of this principle follows im- mediately from the theorem that there is a character peculiar to every group of possible objects. The form in which this principle is usually stated is, that every event must have a cause. (W3:316-17 - note this principle is the same as iv) above.) But he concluded that, although there always is such an exceptionless regularity, our attempts to discover it will be thwarted without "some- thing to guide us". As well as the claim about innateness that we have discussed, Peirce discovers another supposed corollary of this obser- vation. It concerns the fallibility of our inductions: we have no right to assume that "any induction whatever is entirely without excep- tion" or that "we ever do discover the precise cause of things". In- deed, "every empirical rule has an exception". It is evident that Peirce 's views changed between 1878 and 1884. In 1878, he was happy to accept the absolute truth of the principle that every event must have a cause - where he understood this to entail that every event conformed to an exceptionless deterministic law. Although we often use statistical regularities to explain and pre- dict phenomena, there will always be a law accounting for those phe- nomena which is not statistical. But he was sceptical that we would ever arrive at knowledge of such a law: our knowledge will be limited to laws and regularities which, whether statistical or deterministic, are approximately correct. By 1884 he admitted the existence of ab- solute chance, and questioned the absolute truth of the logical or metaphysical principle that every event must have a cause.</page><page sequence="16">16 Christopher Hookway When we ask why Peirce was so confident of this principle in 1878, his reasons appear to involve a nominalistic conception of law. He relies upon a "highly-important logical principle", probably first stated by De Morgan: "any plurality or lot of objects whatever have some character in common (no matter how insignificant) which is peculiar to them and not shared by anything else" (W3:310, 316- 17). Such laws need not be "operative in nature", and there need be no interesting explanation of why the law takes the form that it does: coincidence or accident could have a role in the determination of character which is appealed to in formulating this universal law. Its explanatory value could be extremely limited. Let us now turn to Peirce's reasons for questioning his logico- metaphysical "axiom". For the present, we shall focus on the formula- tion: every fact has an explanation, a reason. What does Peirce gain from questioning it? Once this "axiom" is accepted, we face consider- able explanatory demands: the axiom would be refuted by the exist- ence of a single fact that could receive no explanation. When we ex- plore the range of facts that require explanation, the axiom faces a reductio ad absurdam: if it is absolutely true, we are forced to ac- knowledge that some facts cannot be explained. Once we accept that it is only approximately true, then our explanatory capacities are en- hanced and we escape from the threatening reductio. Unless we ac- knowledge the existence of absolute chance - unless we accept Peirce's "tychism" - , there is a gap between what ought to be explained and what can be explained. Tychism is to be accepted because it provides the best explanation of a range of important phenomena. How does the reductio work: what facts require explanations, but cannot receive them, if the axiom is absolutely true? In "The Architecture of Theories" (1891), Peirce famously argued: Uniformities are precisely the sorts of things that need to be accounted for. That a pitched coin should sometimes turn up heads and sometimes tails calls for no particular explana- tion; but if it shows heads every time, we wish to know how this event has been brought about. Law is par excellence the</page><page sequence="17">The Evolution ofPeirce's Evolutionary Cosmology 17 things that wants a reason. (CP6.12) Evolutionary theory shows how to explain many of the laws and uni- formities of biology. Although such explanations make it probable that "organisms and worlds have taken their origin from a state of affairs indefinitely homogeneous they all suppose essentially the same basis of physical law to have been operative in every age of the uni- verse" ( W4:548, 1884). But, Peirce supposes, it is irrational to think that biological laws require explanations while physical laws do not: Among the things that demand explanation, then, are the laws of physics; and not this law or that law only but every single law. Why are the three laws of mechanics as they are and not otherwise? What is the cause of the restriction of extended bodies to three dimensions?... And then the gen- eral fact that there are laws, how is that to be explained? ... and the postulate that things be explained extends itself to laws as well as to states of things. So we need to explain why the laws of physics (and other disciplines) are as they are. And we also need to explain why the world is law governed at all. These are the explanatory demands that force Peirce's metaphysics to take its distinctively evolutionary turn. The route from these explanatory demands to evolutionary meta- physics can be set out by appeal to a trilemma. Explanations are sought which provide answers to why-questions such as: 1 . Why are the laws of physics not different? 2. Why are there any laws of nature at all? 3. Why is the world governed by laws to the degree that it is? One's first thought is that three styles of answer are possible to these questions, all of which Peirce would find unsatisfactory. First we could deny that these questions have answers at all. This involves a straightforward rejection of the fundamental logical axiom, since it</page><page sequence="18">18 Christopher Hookway acknowledges that some facts have no cause or reason. Secondly, we could offer naturalistic answers to these questions, ones that appeal to laws of nature. This looks circular: what laws are we to appeal to when we try to explain the laws or uniformities appealed to in the proffered explanations? Third, these facts have explanations which do not appeal to laws of nature: perhaps we explain these laws by invoking the power of a transcendent God. Peirce frequently ridi- culed such explanations, and adopting this strategy would threaten the integrity of his system of categories: it appeals to something other than law (mediation or thirdness) in order to understand the rela- tions between laws and the individual events which they govern. If the second and third answers are to be rejected, then we are thrown back on the first and we are obliged to reject the fundamental axiom. Peirce needed to find a way out of this trilemma. His evolution- ary cosmology provides a way of doing so. It frees the second strat- egy of the circularity that it appeared to face. How does this work? Peirce addresses this issue on a number of occasions. Since we are interested in the development of his thought during the 1880s, it will be useful to consider several examples from that period. a) Design and Chance (1884) This is the paper in which Peirce proposed that "on excessively rare sporadic occasions a law of nature is violated in some infinitesi- mal degree" (W4:549). Once we take into account that chance is governed by the laws of the probability calculus, it becomes possible to argue that chance "has the property of being able to produce uni- formities far more strict than those from which it works" (W4:551). Peirce's first illustration of this concerns a gambling game: A million players sit down to play a fair game. Each bets one dollar each time which he has an even chance of winning or losing... [Suppose] that the dice used by the players become worn down in the course of time. Chance changes every- thing and chance will change that. And we will suppose that they are worn down in such a way that every time a man</page><page sequence="19">The Evolution ofPeirce's Evolutionary Cosmology 19 wins, he has a slightly better chance of winning on subse- quent trials. This will make little difference in the first mil- lion bets, but its ultimate effect would be to separate the players into two classes those who had gained and those who had lost with few or none who had neither gained nor lost and these classes would separate themselves, more and more, faster and faster. (W4:549-550) Having illustrated the same point by indicating how certain laws of nature - he mentions Boyle's Law, Charles' Law and the Second Law of Thermodynamics - are "statistical facts" or the results of chance, he ventures that perhaps all known laws are statistical results: Now I will suppose that all known laws are due to chance, and repose upon others less rigid themselves due to chance and so on in an infinite regress, the further we go back the more indefinite being the nature of the laws, and in this way we see the possibility of an indefinite approximation toward a complete explanation of nature. (W4:551-2) This is vague, but a supplement to "Design and Chance" (W4:552-4) takes a further step forward. In "The Order of Nature", discussing innate ideas, Peirce had argued that our innate tendencies had to be treated with caution. His example was the "tendency to personify everything, and to attribute human characteristics to it" (W3:318), an innate predisposition which was "very soon overcome by civilised man in regard to the greater part of the objects about him". If that is taken as warning against thinking of material things in anthropomorphic terms, Peirce soon ceased to heed his own warn- ing. For his next step was to build on his dice playing example to construct an analysis of "Design or Intelligence"-, the principles of probability enabled us to explain "some of the main laws of cerebra- tion and particularly the formation of habits"(W4:553). And he then concluded that the laws of physics may be "habits gradually acquired by systems." n This anthropomorphic suggestion that the processes</page><page sequence="20">20 Christopher Hookway whereby we acquire habits of conduct provides a model that can be used for understanding laws of nature, was already explicitly endorsed in a manuscript of 1881, "Methods of Reasoning": When, in consequence of receiving a certain sensation, we act in a certain way by force of habit, which is a rule opera- tive within the organism, our action cannot be said to be an inference, but it conforms to the formula of Barbara. So when an effect follows upon its cause by virtue of a law of nature, the operation of causation takes place in Barbara. These in- stances give us an inkling that logic is far more than an art of reasonings: its forms have psychological and metaphysical importance. (W4: 252) And we find similar claims that metaphysics should adopt anthropo- morphic categories when he reasons from the premise that philoso- phy seeks to explain or "to show what there is intelligible or reason- able within" the universe at large to the conclusion (ua postulate, which however may not be completely true") that "the process of nature and the process of thought are alike" (Houser and Kloesel, xxix).12 b) Subsequent Formulations Both in "One, Two, Three" and in "A Guess at the Riddle", the idea suggested in "Design and Chance" is further developed. Having put forward the suggestion that "the universe is progressing from a state of all but pure chance to a state of all but complete determination by law", he draws out the consequence that "there is an original, elemen- tal tendency of things to acquire determinate properties, to take hab- its". This tendency to take habits is "the mediating element between Chance, which brings forth First and original events, and law, which produces sequences or Seconds"( W5 :293). In "A Guess at the Riddle", this idea is developed in a way that shows clearly its promised route from our trilemma. "Habit taking" does not introduce something which is categorially distinct from law. This tendency is itself a law which</page><page sequence="21">The Evolution ofPeirce's Evolutionary Cosmology 21 explains the evolution of laws, including itself: This tendency itself constitutes a regularity, and is continu- ally on the increase. In looking back into the past we are looking towards periods when it was a less and less estab- lished tendency. But its own essential nature is to grow. It is a generalizing tendency; it causes actions in the future to follow some generalization of past actions; and this tendency is itself something capable of similar generalization; and thus it is self-generative. We have therefore only to suppose the smallest spur of it in the past, and that spur would have been bound to develope into a mighty and over-ruling principle, until it supersedes itself by strengthening habits into abso- lute laws regulating the action of all things in every respect in the indefinite future. (HK277) Chance may account for the "small spur", and once this is in place, Peirce's metaphysical hypothesis explains the evolution of law. So far, however, it is only an hypothesis and requires to be refined and tested before it forms part of a properly scientific metaphysics. What we need to understand is why it was a plausible hypothesis; why is it an abductive suggestion that Peirce thinks should be taken seri- ously? And, most important, what is the role of logical consider- ations in all this? 6. Laws and Reality: The Fundamental Logical Axiom In view of Peirce's qualified scepticism about the prospects for a gen- eral account of the constitution or character of the universe when he wrote "The Order of Nature", we must now examine why he became embroiled in the search for such an account only half a decade later. Although reflection on the role of evolutionary explanations in biol- ogy and on the possibility of questioning the absolute truth of axioms had a role in determining the general shape which his account took, they do not fully explain why he began to think that such an account was a matter of pressing philosophical importance. Several remarks</page><page sequence="22">22 Christopher Hookway noted in the last section, together with Peirce's long lasting commit- ment to giving a role to logic in grounding metaphysical hypotheses, make it reasonable to hope that the "source" of these developments in his thought lies in demands arising within his work in logic. It will be useful to bear in mind a strategy that Peirce formally enunciated only several years later. Inquiry is governed by a body of regulative principles: norms whose truth cannot be established within logic, but which rationality enjoins us to hope are true13. There is no guarantee that human inquiry can find the answer to every question that arises; but declaring a question beyond our cognitive grasp threat- ens to "block the road of inquiry". Rationality requires us to hope that each question we encounter is capable of being answered even- tually by responsible human inquiry. A metaphysical hypothesis de- serves to be taken seriously if it enables us to see how these hopes might be true - although, of course, it should only be accepted if it survives rigorous empirical testing. If logic enjoins us to accept (or to hope) that laws can be explained - and that law in general can be explained - then a metaphysical theory that enables us to escape the trilemma outlined in the last section deserves our attention. If it seems that only a system of evolutionary cosmology offers an escape route, then we have a priori reasons for hoping that such a system of cos- mology can be attained. Of course, the details of the cosmology will then call for serious scientific investigation. Can we see how developments in Peirce's logic around 1880 could have forced him to take this line of thought seriously? A useful clue is provided by a puzzling feature of "Design and Chance". Re- call that Peirce offered four different formulations of the fundamen- tal logical axiom whose absolute truth he wished to challenge: i) Real things exist. ii) Every intelligible question whatever is susceptible in its own nature of receiving a definitive and satisfactory answer, if it be sufficiently investigated by observation and reasoning. (This is Peirce's favoured formulation of the principle.)</page><page sequence="23">The Evolution of Peirce's Evolutionary Cosmology 23 iii) Nature is uniform; (This is offered as Mill's favoured formulation of the principle.) iv) Every event has a cause. (This is "one of the most popular although not one of the most scientifically accurate statements of the axiom". Peirce claimed that it entailed that every fact had an explanation.) The suggestion that i)-iv) are necessarily equivalent would be interesting and controversial. But Peirce is claiming that they are alternative formulations of the same axiom-, why? Note that the route from questioning the axiom to evolutionary metaphysics focuses on iv) and its entailment about explanation, while i) and ii) are con- cerned with the nature of reality. This offers support for the sugges- tion that problems about reality are at the source of Peirce's concern with these problems; and the claimed equivalence of i) - iv) suggests a close connection between questions about reality and questions about explanation. Sympathetic interpretation will be required: i) is barely intelligible as it stands and should be taken only as pointing us towards questions about reality better articulated in ii); and we must not ignore Peirce's avowed dissatisfaction with the formulations iii) and iv). Our question must concern how the metaphysics allows us to accept ii) while denying that it is exactly or absolutely true. To that end we must consider two separate issues. What is involved in deny- ing the exact truth of ii)? And why does the truth of ii) depend upon there being explanations of laws and of law in general? One might suppose that ii) entails iv) (or its entailment) fairly immediately. Since 'Why are the laws of dynamics as they are?' and 'Why are there laws of nature?' are obviously intelligible questions, then (given ii)) they must have discoverable answers; and the truth of iv) (or of some principle related to it) is a necessary condition of all such questions being answerable. But this argument would estab- lish, at best, that ii) entails iv) - it would not establish the two way entailment which is a necessary condition of their being formulations of the same axiom. And it is not obviousüvaít these abstract and strange questions are intelligible. Peirce's linking of these apparently distinct</page><page sequence="24">24 Christopher Hookway formulations must go deeper than this proposal would allow. We need to find a connection between the formulations about causation and explanation and the application of ii) to less arcane, more everyday questions. If we could find this connection, then we would have an account of how problems facing Peirce's account of truth and reality (the account formulated as ii)) forced him to seek a metaphysical explanation of the nature of law. How might there be such a connec- tion? In "An American Plato", Peirce wrote: If nothing is ever settled [about some practical matter], it will be because the phenomena do not consistently point to any theory; and in that case there is a want of that "unifor- mity of nature" (to use a popular but very loose expression) which constitutes reality, and makes it differ from a dream. (W5:228) This suggests that conformity to law and the possibility of receiving an explanation constitute reality: to be real is to be governed by law; and we distinguish real things from figments or dreams by discover- ing that they conform to laws of nature. An experience of a diamond is dismissed as an illusion when its behaviour contravenes the law we have observed to hold of diamonds. It is important to note that if the uniformity of nature is de- fended in the nominalistic fashion associated with De Morgan, being traceable to the fact that any collection of objects or events has some property in common, then it could not be used to distinguish real diamonds from illusions. For there will be uniformities fitting the behaviour of the collection made up of 'real' diamonds together with this illusory one. This suggests, especially when conjoined with the garbled formulation (i), that we are concerned with Peirce's struggle to defend realism. When Peirce defends the Method of Science in his 1877 paper "The Fixation of Belief, he ties use of this method to accepting a "Fundamental Hypothesis":</page><page sequence="25">The Evolution ofPeirce's Evolutionary Cosmology 25 There are real things, whose characters are entirely inde- pendent of our opinions about them; those realities affect our senses according to regular laws, and, though our sensations are as different as our relations to the objects, yet, by taking advantage of the laws of perception, we can ascertain how things really are, and any man, if he have suf- ficient experience and reason enough about it, will be led to the one true conclusion. Starting from the assertion that "there are real things", he arrives at the claim that (in effect) any intelligible question possesses an an- swer that can be discovered through sufficient inquiry. The bridge between these two rests on his belief that "realities affect our senses according to regular laws". In other words, the link between the first and second formulations of the "axiom" depends upon propositions which are closely related to the views about causation, uniformity and explanation expressed in the other formulations. We can now ask what would be involved in each of these axioms being only approximately true. For the later formulations, this is clear: there are random or chance deviations from laws and regulari- ties. What effect has this upon the second formulation? Peirce con- siders what it would show if it turned out that "some questions even- tually get settled, and that some others, indistinguishable from the others by any marks, never do" (W5:228). If this were the case then, at best, ii) would be only approximately true. In that case, Peirce avows, his conception of reality "was rather a faulty one, for while there is a real so far as a question that will be settled goes, there is none for a question that will never get settled." If we agree that there are questions which will never get settled, "we ought to admit that our conception of nature as absolutely real is only partially cor- rect" (W5:228). It is tempting to conclude that denying the absolute correctness of the logical axiom we are concerned with involves ad- mitting this possibility: some intelligible questions will not get settled and it is only approximately true that nature is absolutely real. The equivalence of these different formulations requires that there</page><page sequence="26">26 Christopher Hookway are chance deviations from laws if, and only if, there are questions that will never get settled. Given the pattern of argument we have been examining, it also entails that allowing that there are some ques- tions which will never get settled enables us to understand how, in general, questions do get settled. These connections are probably straightforward: if some events occur by chance, some intelligible "why" questions have no determinate answer; and if some intelli- gible "why" questions have no fully satisfactory answer it follows that some events are not fully determined by law. 7. Logic, Evolution and Reality "Design and Chance" contains the remark that "Evolution is the postulate of logic itself; for what is explanation but the adoption of a simpler hypothesis to account for a complex state of things"(W4:547). While it is easy to see that evolutionary explanations do account for complex things in simpler terms, this quotation, taken in context, appears to suggest that logic requires us to adopt a fundamental ex- planatory framework with an evolutionary structure. This could make sense on two assumptions: i) Logic requires us to hope that we can overcome the trilemma discussed in section 5) above.14 ii) A priori, logical reflection enables us to see that an evolutionary account of law is the only way to escape the trilemma. We saw how Peirce could argue for the second of these. Our task, in seeking the logical sources of Peirce's evolutionary cosmology, is to understand why he was committed to the first.. The deep issue concerns the intelligibility of very general, meta- physical "why" questions: why are the laws of physics as they are?; why is there lawfulness in the universe at all? According to Murray Murphey, "The theory of inquiry of the 1870s had by 1890 led to problems which are answerable, if at all, only by cosmology" (1961, p. 323). He begins from Peirce's appeal to instinctive or "innate" com-</page><page sequence="27">The Evolution of Peirce's Evolutionary Cosmology 27 mon sense beliefs in order to explain how we can arrive at plausible hypotheses about nature surprisingly quickly. These instincts origi- nate, we may assume, through natural selection, and Peirce's "criti- cal common-sensism" requires us to question instinctive beliefs criti- cally before taking seriously their recommendations about which hy- potheses to take seriously. Once we move away from the contexts in which these instincts have evolved, their reliability is open to ques- tion: "a significant change in the nature of either man or the envi- ronment can alter the desirability and utility of belief or the effec- tiveness of our ways of seeking it"(p.326). Although Murphey does not do so, we could note that our cognitive instincts did not develop because they were effective at meeting the very special needs of post- Galilean theoretical science: "it is quite conceivable that evolution could take a course which would make our current adaptation posi- tively dysfunctional"(p.326). For this reason, we need to "to deter- mine the future course of evolution", to estimate "what sorts of laws, if any, we may expect nature to follow in the future and in areas as yet little explored": "we need a method for finding methods so that we may be able to deal with such situations as may arise". This need is met by the evolutionary cosmology, which thus has a methodologi- cal role15. Apel's interpretation focuses on Peirce's struggles with nomi- nalism. The review of Royce forced Peirce to distinguish between "the final opinion 'which would be sure to result from sufficient investigation' and the empirically conditioned circumstances that the final opinion 'may possibly, in reference to a given question, never be actually attained'" (1981, p. 140). This distinction between what would occur and what will happen calls for a realist conception of modalities and laws: it requires Peirce to attach weight to a distinc- tion between real laws and accidental generalizations which he ne- glected when he appealed to De Morgan in "The Order of Nature". The first step towards introducing this distinction, we might sup- pose, is to recognize that laws, unlike accidental generalisations, can receive explanations: we expect an account of why water expands on freezing. The evolutionary cosmology is suited to meeting this de-</page><page sequence="28">28 Christopher Hookway mand. As Apel has insisted, the most striking tensions facing Peirce's theory of inquiry stem from his reluctance, in the 1870s, to adopt a realist theory of laws (p.76ff). The most famous of these is the prob- lem of the diamond from "How to Make our Ideas Clear"16. Would it be false to say that nothing is hard until it is touched or tested, its hardness increasing with the pressure until it is scratched? (W3:267). If a diamond were crystallized in a bed of soft cotton and then de- stroyed before being touched, would it be false to say that it was soft? (W3:266). Peirce's nominalistic response is to say that while such descriptions would revise current usage, they contain nothing false. Despite some later protestations, it is implausible that these passages were simply a loose expression of issues about which Peirce had a better understanding than he revealed. Nominalistic ideas about the nature of law are too widespread in his writings at this time for that to be the explanation. The evolutionary cosmology offers the tendency to take habits as something that mediates between laws and particu- lar events, whereas the nominalistic view does not regard laws as sepa- rate entities whose relations to events require mediation. By the 1880s Peirce had materials available for a better under- standing of laws and their relations to the events which they explain17. Murphey's analysis finds the motivation for developing a system of evolutionary cosmology in the need for more help with inventing laws than instinct and common sense can provide whereas Apel focuses on the need to take seriously realism about laws and would be's. The em- phasis, in "Design and Chance" and elsewhere, upon how laws are to be explained, together with Peirce's attempt to explain how the ten- dency to take habits mediates between laws and particular events makes Apel's kind of interpretation more plausible. Although, as William Davenport has noticed, Peirce asserted in 1898 that the considerations emphasized by Murphey had provided the "living motive" for his evo- lutionary inquiries, there is little trace of it in the writings of the early 1880s. Davenport's own view was that it would have been "insuffi- cient ground for investigating evolutionism, had he not seen support- ing considerations of a more theoretical character" (1981, p.308). Peirce's own account of his motivation in 1884 appeals to the issues</page><page sequence="29">The Evolution of Peirce's Evolutionary Cosmology 29 about explanation and law that we have stressed above. But even if the problems about laws and nominalism which Apel emphasizes were in the background, it is striking that they receive little explicit recognition in the papers under discussion. Peirce's emphasis is on the need to answer extremely general why questions which seek explanations of particular laws and of lawfulness in gen- eral. The method of science carries a commitment to explaining laws and patterns: this commitment cannot be met without exploiting evolutionary explanations to escape the trilemma I outlined above. If these general "why questions" make sense, then, unless the evolu- tionary cosmology can be defended, there are intelligible questions which will receive no "definitive and satisfactory answer". Peirce does not say, in these papers, that the intelligibility of "why" questions applied to laws is tied to the question of realism about laws. However since possessing an explanation of a law will enable us to predict that and how it would operate in cases which are not ob- served or experienced by human beings, it seems certain that struggles to avoid nominalistic doctrines and formulations during the 1870s would have encouraged the sorts of philosophical developments we have been examining here. We should recall the passage from "An American Plato" where Peirce wrote of that "uniformity of nature" "which constitutes reality, and makes it differ from a dream"(W5:228). A distinction between "real" laws and accidental generalisations can be described as a distinction between those uniformities which are "realities" and those which are figments. The real laws will be those which consistently point to a theory, which can receive an explana- tion. Thus, it seems, the need to distinguish laws from accidental regularities will lead Peirce to ask "why" questions about laws. One further piece of evidence supports this reading: this is Peirce's demand that we explain "law in general". "Why" questions, requests for explanation, are typically contrastive: we ask why diamonds are hard rather than soft18, why the car stopped on the highway rather than contihuing to work, why it stopped on the highway rather than at another stage on the trip, etc. If a scientific (biological, physical or metaphysical) explanation is required, then the contrasting state of</page><page sequence="30">30 Christopher Hookway affairs (the "foil") must be at least logically possible. A physical or evolutionary explanation of why there are no contradictions would make no sense. Thus, when Peirce asks why there is lawfulness, why there are laws in general, he is committed to the logical possibility of there being no laws. The evolutionary explanation accounts for some- thing which, in some sense, might have been otherwise. The discussion of the uniformity of nature in "The order of things" concludes that a lawless universe, one which displays no uniformities, is a logical im- possibility: no sense attaches to it. This argument, we noted, rested upon an argument of De Morgan's which employed a nominalist conception of law. Once there is a real distinction between accidental uniformities and real laws, the logical possibility emerges that there be no laws, although the universe exhibits accidental regularities. Once this distinction is in place, the explanatory demands Peirce confronted in the 1880s make sense. In fact, we have misstated the matter slightly. Given what Peirce wrote in "An American Plato", a "universe" with no laws would contain no realities. In that case, it is far from obvious that there could be such a "universe". It might be better to say that Peirce needed to explain why there is any reality rather than (at best) merely isolated chance events and accidental (unreal) uniformities. Revising the formulation in this manner does not weaken the general point being made. The arguments suggested by "The order of things" entail that such a universe, in virtue of containing uniform regulari- ties, would contain laws and thus contain realities. This would be enough to deprive the "why" question about "laws in general" of any clear sense. Moreover, the reformulation contributes to our un- derstanding of the relations between the four formulations of the logical axiom discussed in "Design and Chance". My concern in this paper has been to understand why Peirce began to search for a system of evolutionary cosmology during the 1880s. My conclusion, not unexpected, is that it was linked to a growing awareness of the implications of realism and of the demands of his theory of inquiry. A full understanding of these developments, however, must await a detailed examination of the developments in</page><page sequence="31">The Evolution of Peirce's Evolutionary Cosmology 31 Peirce's understanding of his categories over the same period. University of Sheffield NOTES 1. This is a much revised and extended version of a paper given at the Chance, Love and Logic Conference in Aarhus. It has benefited greatly from comments made when it was presented and from conversations with other participants at that extremely valuable and enjoyable occasion. 2. See Hookway 1995 for a discussion of these topics. I have attemped to give a general account of Peirce's evolutionary story in chapter IX of 2%m*( 1985). 3 . The best current source of this text is The Essential Peirce (eds. Houser and Kloesel), pp. 245-279. Murphey was aware of "A Guess at the Riddle", but he wrongly dated it as 1890. This understandable error, together with his apparent ignorance of "Design and Chance", explains his belief that Peirce's work on metaphysics began around 1890, representing a sudden fun- damental shift "following five years of very slight philosophical activity" (p. 323). 4. This attitude was present throughout his career. It is most prominent in the first of the Cambridge Conferences Lectures of 1898, where Peirce exposes the intellectual folly of supposing that philosophy can help with the solution of "vital questions". These lectures are published in Reasoning and the Logic of Things. I have examined the grounds of Peirce's view in Hookway (1993). 5 . Of course, 'metaphysics' is a technical term of philosophy, and it is far from clear that his usage of the term was the same in 1868, 1884 and 1903. But we can certainly draw from these remarks the conclusion that Peirce supposed that progress in metaphysics depended upon use of the scientific method and that the discipline was not, in 1868, in a position to make rapid progress. 6. This argument is retained in the 1883 "A Theory of Probable Inference": "That there is a general tendency toward uniformity in nature is not merely an unfounded, it is an absolutely absurd, idea in any other sense</page><page sequence="32">32 Christopher Hookway than that man is adapted to his surroundings" (W4:446). 7. Similar remarks occur in "A Theory of Probable Inference" ( 1883): "Nature is a far vaster and less clearly arranged repertory of facts than a census report; and if men had not come to it with special aptitudes for guessing right, it may well be doubted whether in the ten or twenty thousand years that they may have existed their greatest mind would have attained to the amount of knowledge which is actually possessed by the lowest idiot" (W4:447). In 1883 too, Peirce appeals to innate or instinctive belief: "all human knowledge, up to the highest flights of science, is but the development of our inborn animal instinct" (W4:450). 8. The difference noted here between Peirce's attitude towards the "innateness" of time and space and of the categories is relevant to the diffi- cult issue of how his philosophy relates to Kant's. By treating Space and Time as a priori forms which supplement the categories - rather than as concepts which can be learned through observation and inference - Kant is committed to seeing the cases as parallel. Peirce's "pragmatist" insistence that the only "a priori" forms we require are the categories of the understanding commits him to distinguishing two kinds of "innateness" as suggested here. 9 . William Davenport's account of the links between Peirce's evo- lutionism and his logic places concentrates upon the arguments to be discussed here (Davenport 1981). 10. This is "not one of the most scientifically accurate statements of the axiom". 11. A lengthy and very useful examination of this anthropomor- phic approach to laws of nature is Pape (1984). 12. This passage suggests a kind of justification for "making our logic our metaphysics" which is significantly different from the kind employed in Kant's metaphysical deduction - and is also different from what Peirce had in mind during the 1860s. A parallel formal structure between thought and the external world is proposed as an explanatory hypothesis: it is not an a priori claim. 13. I have discussed this aspect of Peirce's metaphysics in "Meta- physics, Science and Self-Control" (Hookway 1995). 14. It should be emphasized here that Peirce does not set out the "trilemma" as it has been set out in this paper. I claim only that the trilemma encapsulates the structure of argument which is discussed in Peirce's paper.</page><page sequence="33">The Evolution of Peirce's Evolutionary Cosmology 33 15. We noted above Peirce's insistence in 1883 that "all human knowledge, up to the highest nights of science, is but the development of our inborn animal instinct"(W4:450). This appears to be in tension with the views of Murphey discussed here. If so, his account of the source of Peirce's evolu- tionary cosmology is doubtful. 16. Apel traces a number of discussions of this problem from writ- ings earlier in the decade. 17. However, as Apel notes, Peirce was unable to embrace such realism fully (or else unable to grasp its full implications) in papers such as "An American Plato". 18. For a discussion of the contrastive character of "why" ques- tions, see Lipton (1991).
