<plain_text><page sequence="1">TOWARD A DATE FOR THE GREEK FOURTH ECLOGUE A Greek version of Vergil's Fourth Eclogue occurs in chapters 19-21 of the Oration of Constantine to the Holy Assembly, interspersed heavily with prose commentary.' This Oration was presumably delivered in Latin, originally, by the emperor. The Greek speech containing the translation of the Fourth Eclogue forms the conclusion to the Life of Constantine, a work attributed to Eusebius of Caesarea. The time of the translation of the Fourth Eclogue is important for indicating a period of interest in Latin literature in the Greek- speaking world, as well as for understanding the Christianization of the poem which occurred in translation." No one has established the date of the Greek version, however,3 nor has it been located as prior to the Greek form of the Oration (hence independent of it), concurrent with its translation, or subsequent to it. There is evidence from the texts themselves, although no original Latin Oration remains, that points to these conclusions: 1) the Fourth Eclogue was translated after the Oration was;4 2) it was produced for the Oration in its 'Fourth Eclogue found in R.A.B. Mynors' edition: P. Vergilius Maro, Opera, Oxford Classical Texts (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1969; corrected reprint 1976). The most recent critical edition of the Oration of Constantine to the Holy Assembly (including the Greek Fourth Eclogue) is that of Ivar A. Heikel: Eusebius Pamphili, Werke, vol. 1:1 (Leipzig: J. C. Hinrichs, 1902) 149-193. An edition of the commentary with the Greek poem is included in Andries Bolhuis, Vergilius' Vierde Ecloga in de Oratio Constantini ad Sanctorum Coetum (Ermelo 1950). An edition of the Greek version of the poem alone was done by Alfons Kurfess in "Die griechische Ubersetzung der vierten Ekloge Vergils," Mnemosyne Third Series 5 (1937) 283-288. 2This translation and commentary would be the first instances of Christian messianic interpretation of the Fourth Eclogue, according to Pierre Courcelle, "Les exegeses chretiennes de la quatrieme Eclogue," Revue des Etudes Anciennes 59 (1957) 294-315. :The question of the date of the version is generally not recognized as an important issue and hence is not discussed, even in some of the major studies of this century: Joannes Maria Pf'ittisch, "Die vierte Ekloge Vergils in der Rede Konstantins an die Versammlung der Heiligen," Programm des koniglichen Gymnasiums im Benediktinerkloster Ettal, 1912-1913. 3-91; A. Kurfess, loc. cit., and "Zu Kaiser Konstantins Rede an die Versammlung der Heiligen," Theologische Quartalschrift 130 (1950) 145-165, and "Observatiunculae ad P. Vergilii Maronis Eclogae Quartae Interpretationem et Versionem Graecam," Mnemosyne N. S. 40 (1912) 277-284 (although he does see a different hand in each translation, "Die griechische Ubersetzung," 284, and "'Konstantins Rede," 162); Victor Reichmann, R6mische Literatur in griechischer Ubersetzung, Philologus Supplementband 34 (1943) 58-61; A. Bolhuis, op. cit.; Pierre Courcelle, loc. cit., who thinks one person did both translations, 296 n. 1; Barry Baldwin, "Vergilius Graecus," American Journal of Philology 97 (1976) 361-368. The chapter on the Greek version in Ciro Monteleone, L'Egloga Quarta da Virgilio a Constantino (Manduria: Lacaita, 1975), also fails to discuss the date of this version, and where it tries to point out an especially close relationship between the version and the original (p. 88, regarding line 28), it refers to a conjectural emendation in Vergil, rendering the observation worthless. 4Hence the Greek poem is also after the original sermon, which one could closely date if it were authentic; otherwise it would have to be late- or post-Eusebian. On the dates of documents in Eusebius, see A. Piganiol, "L'authenticite et l'historicite de la 'Vita Constantini' attribuee ai Eusebe de Cesar6e, " Bulletin de 1'Academie Belge, Classe des Lettres, Serie 5,39 (1953) 462-479, 336</page><page sequence="2">GREEK FOURTH ECLOGUE 337 Greek form; 3) the translator used the Oration in Greek along with the Latin poem in producing the Greek version of the poem. The method used to reach these conclusions is similar to that used in grouping manuscripts for textual- critical studies, or in source criticism of the Synoptic Gospels. A close textual comparison of the Fourth Eclogue and its Greek version made clear the areas of reliable translation and those of limited or extreme alterations. Next the Greek version was checked against the interspersed commentary, which often repeats or paraphrases material from the poem. The commentary was also compared with the Latin poem. The differences in translation or wording, like the errors in manuscripts, provided the key to arranging the sequence of translation,5 The patterns of translation changes, leading to the stated conclusions, are: commentary and version agree, against original; and, original and commentary agree, against version. Taken together, these two groupings mark the version as sharing irregular translations with the commentary and as adding some alterations of its own. Two apparent counterexamples show original and version agreeing, against the commentary; no other counterexamples are evident. The accompanying table summarizes the evidence. I.

If one translation has an alteration which the other does not, the two are independent at that point. If one translation shares the alterations of the other and in addition has independent changes, it is secondary. In this instance, the possibility of actual copying is ruled out because of the difference in form of the Greek works-one a metrical version of the Fourth Eclogue (hereafter "version"), the other a consciously Christianizing prose commentary (hereafter "commentary").</page><page sequence="3">338 DAVID N.

Commentary plus Greek version against Latin poem. The first group of translation changes-commentary agrees with version, against original-ap- pears in at least seven places throughout the poem. The word orbis at line 17 becomes K6O'-to- in the version, while the commentary in chapter 20 verse 2 calls the poet an dv'C p KEKOo-'LrLo'EVo.6 The pun in Greek is obvious and demonstrates dependence between the commentary and the version. At line 23, cunabula is rendered by the somewhat imprecise oardcpyava, a word which recurs in the portion of the commentary which follows, in 20.3, and blandos is improved to Eai8,&amp;j in both Greek works. The translator expands the term serpens of line 24 to iop6dhov p(150L' gpr7TETOl in the version, while the com- mentary in 20.3 uses the phrase 6 06; To70 6~,pEW, and in 20.5 stands 7radcoa - 70TV iofhXv "l(pL't. Here both the Greek texts have added i6 or an 6id- derivative. The version rearranges line 28, strangely using ijyovro to translate flauescet, while the immediately following line of commentary at 20.7 ex- plains, TO7VTEOTLV, 6 Kap~do' 70To vkiov v6ov 'qOYETO Eo XPEiav, repeating the verb in the same tense but apparently in a different voice, and producing a less forced expression.7 In the translation of line 40 the version shows daoraproap , ro9o, and adK~vj 8pE7~OvoLO, none of which has a source in the Latin poem (except per- haps falx for 8pl.iravov), and dv'rporog as a condensation of the first part of the line.

'qpripa.11 The commentary at the beginning of 21.3 seems to use LLtEL8Ltd in referring to the same phrase; again, the use of the same slightly imprecise verb points to agreement between the version and the commentary. II. Commentary plus Latin original against Greek version. The second group of translation changes-commentary agrees with original, against ver- sion-also occurs frequently. Vergil pleads with the goddess in lines 8-10 to favor the infant boy, and the commentary recognizes this as inconsistent with Christian teaching, so it proceeds to defend the poet for praying and carrying out pagan ritual for the infant. iva 8` "r d&amp;yptov 7q &lt;6"r'oqro09 .KKXiVOL, 'qyayE 7&amp;~ c8tavoa 7T"v aKOOV7'rV 7Trpd~ 7Tv av ro o-vvlrtELav. But the version has altered the poem to show rdv 8E6 VEWOMT r w&amp;Vw TEXivra, ?paEo-pdpopE Pvrll . . . . rpoOrKVEL, which inverts the social order and tells the goddess to adore a superior. If this were the form of the poem that the commentator was using, the defense of Vergil would have been unnecessary and incomprehensible; on the other hand, altering the version despite the com- mentary is not unthinkable. So the two Greek texts must be independent here. At line 23 the commentary renders the word flores with &amp;'vrl at 20.3 and 20.5, but the version's equivalent line is corrupt in the last one or two feet, 4pVOEa 8' E lw8rl'd T do-Trpyava OEt .... The codices read at this point either (o-EL)oTEVVyhIXELV or (o-EL)TEVLITr)Yv,12 which seems to prohibit the insertion of dvvO-r into the last foot-the only space available. Hence the version omits the word for "flowers," which the original and the commentary show. For the word serpens from line 24 the commentary gives 6optL, which is the Biblical word from the story of the Fall, the very reference which the commentator indicates in 20.3, but the version has P7rT0d6v, disagreeing with the commentary and following a pattern, visible elsewhere in the version, of rendering Latin words with similar-sounding Greek terms.13 An alternative punctuation for lines 24-25 precedents for the phrase dorTaprov Kait dvrjporov were available in Horace and elsewhere; then he goes on to deny any real interdependence between the version and the commentary at this point, 275-276. 9Cf. Kurfess, "Observatiunculae," 282. Again, he later reverses himself ("Latein- Griechisch," 275), claiming that only one place seems to contraindicate the theory of a commentary independent of the version; yet he volunteers no disproof of this counterexample. 'oCf. R.D. Williams, "Virgil Eclogues 4.60-63," Classical Philology 71 (1976) 119-121, who argues that the child's smile in line 60 reinforces the reading qui non risereparenti in line 62, 120. "This reading is an emendation of Valois, according to Heikel's apparatus ad loc. The manuscripts, though corrupt, suggest that the participle should modify the child, not the mother, which would lend weight to the argument of Williams. '1Wilamowitz's emendation, o-r6 yE noitqv, adopted by Heikel, merely robs the following line of the ending which the codices indicate and which the original Latin demands. Heikel actually declares, then, that this following line is corrupt, despite the fact that the manuscript testimony is nearly unanimous for this line (and quite comprehensible), while he presumes to reconstruct the preceding line whose testimony is senseless, incomplete (lacking half a foot), and in disarray. 13Note fundere becoming tiow at lines 20 and 23, ferre becoming pitw at line 39, tellus</page><page sequence="5">340 DAVID N.

But the version reads irohkiXov 8E[Tpdwov Kati AavaWv " ITELprJ1ETa . . , substantially altering the terminology found in the other two texts.16 The phrase in line 53, maneat pars ultima uitae, is rendered nearly verbatim in 21.1, 70. f iov 7r rTLhoS Xg) KvVEcor aLt, while the version, which has Etie LE y'qpaXhov (Wdvra tr' .XEt vvi8vtto; lzoxj'/ ...

In reference to lines 62-63, the commentary at 21.3 launches into a denunciation of the anthropomorphic view of God which the poet, it insists, used only because of his time, but the version completely re- verses the original, asserting that what the original viewed as blessings for the child (divine food and marriage) are in fact what the baby will not encounter, so removing Christ from all taint. Here, too, as at lines 8-10, the defense would have been to no effect if the translator of the commentary had used the revised poem.'8 III. Two counterexamples. These lists of agreements between the various texts show that the commentary adheres to the original even when the version goes astray at times, yet at other times it goes astray with the version. Because of the nature of the prose text rendition of the commentary and because of the problems of error in textual transmission, it would be impossible to locate in- stances where all three texts are different. Such an instance could be an argu- ment against the conclusion that the version is dependent on both the original and the commentary. However, there do appear to be two instances from the third possible grouping-version and original agree, against commentary. At line 62, the site of a famous textual problem,'19 the verb risere becomes Eyihao-o-av in the version, but EptEL8iao-av in the commentary, at 21.3. This example loses its effect, however, by the fact that the two verbs are partially becoming 7Ehoov, and sulcus becoming EXKvo-La at line 33. "41 follow the direction of the manuscripts here in reading nroir rather than Heikel's text; cf. Kurfess, "Observatiunculae," 280 n. 1, where, however, he says it was originally a gloss.

Note that both the version and the commentary show yovdE, attesting to their use of a text reading cui non risere parentes in line 62.</page><page sequence="6">GREEK FOURTH ECLOGUE 341 synonymous and that both are appropriate renditions of the Latin verb. In addi- tion, the theory that the translator had both the original and the Greek com- mentary available certainly could allow for a translator to select a synonym. The second instance involves the commentary to line 63, where at 21.3 the commentary asks, hXKTpWO 8E da7rELppov 7i OVK Ot8EV 6v T6 dyYLOV a IT.VE,,a. The subject of interest so far throughout the poem and the commentary has been the boy, taken by the commentary and the version to be Christ. Here the com- mentary suddenly seems to replace the Son with the Holy Spirit. The text of the commentary here, however, shows a rapid shifting of the topics under discussion and is bound together rather by terminology which harks back to the poem. It is noteworthy, first, that there is no reference to any meal with a divine being, which both the poem and the version mention. Next, while the second sentence of 21.3 begins 6 0iv ydip a(7TJV &amp;-o9d in answer to the question posed, "How could his parents have smiled?", the other parent (Mary) neverthe- less fails to be noted. Third, the statement about the Holy Spirit suddenly ap- pears to be a good excuse for an erudite allusion to Aristotle.2" And finally the adjective drTELpo;, used here of the Spirit's asexuality, recurs in 21.4 in an inverted pun, where the unbelieving mob is termed diraELpo; in regard to Theo- sebeia at the end of an apostrophe to her. Hence it appears that the Greek com- mentary uses the first question about the Holy Spirit as an addendum to the question about the smiling of the child's parents and the statements on the in- corporeality of God. There is no intent to follow through with point-by-point interpretations of the poem (as the rest of the sermon-commentary also demon- strates). Thus the incorporeality of God the Father leads to the sexual purity of God, which motivates the apostrophe to Piety, which results in the state- ment about the damned, while the images of smiling, sexual intercourse, and purity are lifted from the poem to suit the commentator's whim. Again here, a translator with both original and commentary may have chosen to render a closer translation in the version. The version of the Fourth Eclogue appears, then, to be made to order for an already translated Oration. It follows the commentary's lead in Christianizing the poem, as at lines 24, 28, 40, and 50, and it often goes even farther, as in the reworking of lines 8-10, 26, and 62-63. This is consonant with the large number of other instances of Christianization in the version.2' Since the Oration is of dubious authenticity, or even if it is at least a part of the original Life of Constantine, the Greek Fourth Eclogue must have appeared late in Eusebius' lifetime or after his death, that is, after the first third of the fourth century.
