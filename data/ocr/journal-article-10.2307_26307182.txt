A CODEX-STYLE MURAL FROM TEHUACAN VIEJO, PUEBLA, MEXICO Edward B. Sissona and T. Gerald Lillyb department of Sociology and Anthropology, University of Mississippi, University, MS 38677, USA bGarrow &amp; Associates, Inc., 13 Glenwood Avenue, Raleigh, NC 27603, USA Abstract Excavation at the Late Postclassic (a.d. 1300-1520) site of Tehuacan Viejo, Puebla, Mexico revealed a room with a codex-style mural. The mural is divided into two zones. The lower zone is composed of white stucco and decorated with red circles. The upper zone is composed of mud plaster and decorated with seven and one-half shields behind which occur crossed lances and banners. Holes in the wall above the painted shields once held wooden pegs for hanging actual shields. The door jambs and circular columns of the eastern doorway are painted with horizontal bands representing the layers of heaven. Streamers hang from these bands. Included in the decoration on these streamers are stylized stars and blue butterflies. These may represent the souls of dead warriors. Symbolically, the room is the heavenly abode of these warriors. The most likely function of the room was as an armory. During the spring of 1991, the University of Mississippi began an archaeological investigation of the Late Postclassic (a.d. 1200-1521) and Early Colonial (a.d. 1521-1570) sites of Tehua can Viejo, Puebla, Mexico. One of the objectives of this first season was to obtain sealed stratigraphic samples from both sites in order to refine the ceramic chronology of this crucial pe riod; this more sensitive chronology will facilitate subsequent archaeological study of the economic and social consequences of the Spanish Conquest. In one stratigraphic test pit (Sondeo 5), a mural was discovered. Depicted on this mural are seven and one-half circular shields behind each of which appear crossed lances and banners. LATE POSTCLASSIC HISTORY OF THE TEHUACAN VALLEY The Tehuacan Valley was invaded in the early thirteenth century by Nonohualca Chichimeca migrants from Tula (Kirchoff et al. 1989:134-138; Velázquez 1975:15). Displacing the original Popoloca and Mazatec-speaking inhabitants of the valley, these Nahuatl-speaking refugees founded a series of small city states, cacicazgos, which incorporated subject towns in the valley and the Sierra de Zongolica to the east. At the time of the Spanish Conquest, Teohuacan (Tehuacan), Cozcatlan (Coxcatlan), and Teotitlan were the cabeceras (capitals) of the three cacicazgos that controlled the valley and much of the Sierra de Zongolica (Figure 1). Some of the subject towns and perhaps the cabeceras themselves were multiethnic. From its cabecera of Cutha, the Popoloca cacicazgo of Tzapotitlan controlled the Zapotitlan side valley to the northwest. By marriage and descent the elites of these cacicazgos (the Teohuaque of Teohuacan, the Cozcateca of Cozcatlan, and the Teotitlanteca of Teotitlan) were linked to one another, to Mix tec elites of the Mixteca Baja (Smith and Parmenter 1991:22, 54, 56) and to Chocho elites of the Coixtlahuaca Valley (Nich olas Johnson, personal communication 1992). In the third quar ter of the fifteenth century, the cacicazgos were conquered by the Culhua Mexica armies of Moteuczomah Ilhuicamina and began to pay tribute to the Aztec empire (Davies 1968:14-16, 1987:213; Hassig 1988:165, 170, 195, 319, 329-330). In 1520, the caciques of Teohuacan, Tzapotitlan, and Coz catlan sent representatives to Tepeyacac (Tepeaca) to pledge loy alty to Cortes (Gerhard 1986:268). In the mid-1530s, Franciscan friars from Huejotzingo established the church and convent of Santa María de la Concepción at the foot of the mesa occupied by the Teohuacan cabecera. The church and convent were moved to the present location of Tehuacan in the 1570s (Kubler 1983:91, 579-580; Martinez del Sobral y Campa 1988:62, 246). Although abandoned by the friars, the general area around the former location was probably occupied on a reduced scale to the present (Goggin 1968:50, 55-56, 169, 180, 194-195). The early Colonial-period site is known locally as Calcahualco or Tehua can Viejo; the Late Postclassic site is known as La Mesa or Ciudad del Sol. DESCRIPTION OF LA MESA The Late Postclassic site of Tehuacan Viejo is located approx imately 6 km southeast of the main plaza of the modern city of Tehuacan. The site occupies all of a mesa that is shaped like an inverted "Y." The mesa has a maximum north-to-south dimen sion of 1.7 km, a maximum east-to-west dimension of .8 km, and an estimated area of 100 ha. The mesa rises 60 m above the adjacent valley floor and would have been easily defended. This probably accounts for the site's location. During the surface sur vey of the mesa, more than 800 distinct structures were identi fied. These include "temples" atop truncated pyramids grouped around plazas and "houses" or long narrow structures arranged 33</page><page sequence="2">34 Sisson and Lilly Figure 1. Cabeceras of Late Postdassic cacicazgos (▲) and contemporary towns descended from them (•). around four sides of sunken patios. The number of individual plazas exceeds 20. SONDEO 5 Sondeo 5 was excavated in the northeast corner of the North Platform. This platform rises 9 m above the Main Plaza of the site and closes it on the north. Access to the North Platform from the Main Plaza is by a stairway that rises in two stages. Atop the platform is a large, enclosed plaza. A narrow, higher platform encloses the North Platform on its north and east sides. Sondeo 5 was placed on this second higher platform. Three Late Venta Salada phase (Late Postclassic) construc tion stages were exposed by Sondeo 5. The uppermost of these was partially excavated revealing two rooms connected by a stairway descending on the south to a third, lower room. Refuse thrown down the stairwell included typical Late Venta Salada ceramics, animal bones, and two pieces of ferrous metal. The pieces of metal indicate that the rooms were still being used in the Colonial period. Built in the Late Postclassic, this structure continued in use until sometime after the Spanish Conquest. Beneath the two upper rooms of this final construction stage were the fragmentary remains of a stucco floor —all that re mained of the second construction stage. This intermediate structure was destroyed by the later building. A single room of the earliest construction stage has been excavated. This room displays a mural painted on its back (west) wall. Entrance to the room is from the east through a wide doorway with two circu lar columns. The columns and door jambs are also painted. The preserved portion of the room is 8.25 m long and 1.64 m wide (Figure 2). The southern end of the room was destroyed when the stairwell of the final construction stage was built. Orig inally, the room would have been 9.22 m long. The western wall of the room is preserved to a height of 1.90-2.27 m. A low plat form 27 cm high, 1.87 m deep, and 1.64 m wide fills the north ern end of the room. There is no comparable platform in the southern end. Entrance to the room was through a doorway 5.54 m wide. Two circular columns divide this opening into three parts. A low raised bump from jambs to columns and between the columns served to keep water out of the room.

Here too there are probably rooms preserved on the north and east sides of a pa tio to the east of the excavated room. The room on the south side would have been destroyed during the final construction stage. The preservation of the room and its mural results from its having been filled so as to serve as a platform for the later struc tures. A wall of uncut stones set in mud mortar and standing 1.23 m high was built in front of the wall showing the mural. This wall was probably built to reinforce this exterior wall and to make the platform more stable. When the wall was com pleted, the room was filled with old adobes and trash to a depth just above the stone wall. Above this, a loose fill of stones and numerous potsherds was laid down. Finally, a thin, hard-packed layer of fine fill was added as a base for the stucco floor of the second construction stage. The destruction of the southern end of the room when the stairwell of the last structure was dug may indicate that the builders were unaware of the room and mural beneath. MURAL OF THE CHIMALES (SHIELDS) Two distinct horizontal zones divide the walls of the room (Fig ures 3 and 4). The lower zone consists of a 75-cm-high stucco wainscot, which continues from the stucco floor up the wall. Twenty-six red circles averaging 35 cm in diameter are painted on the wainscot. The upper zone is composed of an unburnished mud-plas ter base applied to the underlying adobe wall. A burnt-sienna pigment was painted on this base as a ground color for the mu ral. The color of the ground and the unburnished surface give the upper zone a warm rich texture. Thin carbon-black lines out line the designs with great precision. These outlines were filled with red, rose, yellow, orange, blue, white, and black; fine black lines added details. Seven complete circular shields and half of an eighth are pre served on this upper zone. The symmetrical arrangement of the shields around the fifth or central shield and the reconstructed length of the room indicate that there were originally 9 shields on this back wall. Although the shields vary slightly in diame ter, they appear uniform to the eye. The mean horizontal diam eter is 57 cm, the mean vertical diameter 54.5 cm. That is, the shields are slightly flattened vertically. The borders defining the Figure 3. View of room with Manuel Castillo pointing to Shield 3. shields are black (Shield 1), blue (Shields 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8), and white (Shield 5). The symmetrical arrangement of the shields would suggest that the border of Shield 9 should be black. For reasons discussed below, red is a likely alternative. Lances and banners cross diagonally behind each shield. The banners hang from the lance which leans away from the fifth central shield. A "bull's-eye device" adorns the other lance that is inclined toward the central shield. The only exception to this pattern is the fifth shield itself. Here, a bundle of horizontal darts, an atlatl, and a hunter's bag replace the crossed lances and banners. The designs on the shields and on the banners vary from shield to shield. Above each shield is a small circular hole in the wall. The lance shafts are elaborately decorated with red and white diagonal stripes and ties. Above the "bull's-eye device" the lances are tipped with paired streamers and an anthropomor phic blade. The blade typically has red and white fangs beneath a yellow lip, a blue "headband," blue eyebrows, an eye of three concentric black circles with the lateral third painted red, and red vertical streaks of blood on its cheeks. The lance from which the banners hang was also tipped with an anthropomorphic blade. These are only preserved on the lances behind Shields 4 and 6. DESCRIPTION OF INDIVIDUAL SHIELDS Shield 1 Remnants of white paint in the lower-right quadrant indicate that the design in the center of this shield was painted on a white ground (Figure 5). The white pigment used to paint the mural is very powdery and easily detached from the surface. Many of the areas of the shields and banners that now appear to have only the burnt-sienna ground were probably painted white. Blowing on the surface was often sufficient to dislodge the white paint. The design on the first shield is the only anthropomorphic figure in the mural. Iconographic clues easily identify the fig ure as Xipe Totee, "Our Lord of the Flayed Skin." He is de picted in profile facing left (south) and is adorned with his distinctive red and white nose piece, ear plugs, and swallow-tail neck drapes. Copper bells hang from his blue necklace, and on his head appears a feather device with two white feathers and two quetzal feathers attached to a down ball. This representation of Xipe is quite similar to those in the Codex Borgia (Nowotny 1976:2, 24-25, 49, and 67). In addition to the features mentioned above, other shared characteristics in clude the recurved eye, the empty open mouth, the flaccid lower lip, the golden hair below a headband and framing the face, the golden locks down the back of the head, the two erect golden forelocks, the layer of down covering the hair, and the form of the ear. The most striking difference between the Xipe of the mural and versions in the Codex Borgia is the color of the face. In the Codex Borgia, the face is yellow with a red vertical line through the eye. In the mural, the face is red with a black ver tical line on the cheek and black paint about the mouth. Xipe Totee belongs to the Tezcatlipoca complex (Nicholson 1971:398) and is often depicted as the Red Tezcatlipoca. The red color of his face in the mural emphasizes this aspect of Xipe Totee. The artist chose to stress his affiliation with Tezcatlipoca by painting his face red.</page><page sequence="4">36 Sisson and Lilly Figure 4. Perspective drawing of room and mural. The overlapping, vertical banners associated with this shield have a rose ground on which there are dark red stripes and dots. The lower banner has vertical stripes, and the upper one has diagonal stripes. Two streamers top each banner and hang down Figure 5. Shield 1. to the right. The ends of the two upper streamers are painted on the north wall. By painting these ends on the north wall, the artist visually includes the north wall in the composition. This is one of the techniques that unites the room visually and leads us to believe that the room should be viewed as a single composition. The red and white diagonal stripes on the shafts of the lances are like those painted on Xipe Totec's rattle staff. The ends of the ties are scalloped like the tail of a swallow as are the ends of Xipe Totec's loincloth. Shield 2 The circular shield is divided in half diagonally (Figure 6). The lower-right field is predominantly black, and the upper-left field predominantly red. A set of three white parallel stripes is super imposed on each field. Between these two sets of stripes and overlapping the two fields along the diagonal is a row of three feather devices. Rows of two white feather devices occur out side the sets of white stripes. Each feather device consists of four components: "antennae," plume ball, red and white collar, and two feathers. The feather devices resemble the aztaxelli, or forked heron-feather device, associated with Tezcatlipoca, sac rificial victims, and the souls of dead warriors on the roof of the Red Temple in the Codex Borgia (Nowotny 1976:33). The division of the shield into red and black halves is re peated on the lance shafts, the ties, the "bull's-eye device," the banners, and the streamers. This pronounced red and black di vision in combination with the aztaxelli-like feather devices</page><page sequence="5">A codex-style mural from Tehuacan Viejo 37 Figure 6. Shield 2. strongly suggest that the Red and Black Tezcatlipocas are the referents of this shield and its associated banners and lances. The pairing of the Red and Black Tezcatlipoca are common in the Codex Borgia. Shield 3 This shield has the simplest design (Figure 7). A solid red cir cle in the center is circumscribed by a red band. The background is painted white as is the space between the red band and cen ter circle. The design and color patterns of the banners and lances repeat those of Shield 1. Figure 7. Shield 3. Individuals impersonating Xipe Totee in the Codex Borboni cus (Nowotny and de Durand-Forest 1974:24, 27, 34) and the Codex Vaticanus 3738 (1979:8r, 9r, 43r) often carry shields with simple designs like the one on this shield. This correspondence and the similarity between the banners and lances of Shield 1 and those of Shield 3 may indicate that Shield 3 also refers to Xipe Totee. A similar design but with the colors reversed is painted on the left half of the shield carried by Moteuczomah Xocoyotl on p. 85v of the Codex Vaticanus 3738. Victorious over Tolohcan (Toluca), Moteuczomah Xocoyotl wears the Xipe Totee costume. Shield 4 The background of the fourth shield is a checkerboard of red and black squares on the burnt-sienna ground (Figure 8). The checkerboard is divided in half vertically so that the squares on the left are red and those on the right are black. In the center of the shield is a "night eye," or stylized star, surrounded by six concentric bands painted yellow, blue, red, white(?), blue, and yellow. Seven red and blue rays emanate from the fifth band. Flowing from the "night eye" are a blue and black stream and a yellow and black stream. These streams are separated by a twisted rope adorned with feather devices like those of Shield 2 (az.taxeili). These streams represent atl-tlachinolli, "water and burned thing," the Nahuatl metaphor for "war." The rope sep arating the two streams is the aztamecatl, the feathered chord used to bind sacrificial victims. The "night eye," or star, and "war" association suggests a re lationship with Venus, the bright heavenly body in the night sky that is associated with warfare all over Mesoamerica. But Ve nus is usually represented by its own distinctive symbol, which does not occur here. The division of the checkerboard into black Figure 8. Shield 4.</page><page sequence="6">38 Sisson and Lilly and red halves is like that of Shield 2. We suggested earlier that this shield may be associated with Tezcatlipoca. Conceptually, the shield's central motif is very similar to the representation of Tonatiuh, the sun god, in the Codex Borgia (Nowotny 1976:71). Here, Tonatiuh is shown seated on his wooden throne in front of a solar disk. On the left side of the throne, a stream of water, atl, flows from the solar disk. On the right side is a stream of burned things, tlachinolli. Hanging be neath the throne and between the two streams is the aztamecatl. Thus, Shield 4 may be associated with Tonatiuh. The "night eye" in the center of the disc may identify this as either the night sun (Seler 1963:11:42) or the rising sun aspect of Tonatiuh (Caso 1927:34). An anonymous reviewer pointed out to us that a "night eye" appears in the center of the olin sign on the wooden drum from Malinalco. Here, Nahui Olin represents the fifth and final sun or creation and is flanked by eagle and jaguar warriors who carry sacrificial banners and spout atl-tlachinolli from their mouths (Nicholson and Quiñones Keber 1983:146; Pasztory 1983:273). In fact, a "night eye" is common at the center of many representations of Nahui Olin. On a cuauhxicalli (eagle vessel) in the Museum fiir Vólkerkunde in Berlin (Pasztory 1983:Color plates 46-48), the "Stone of the Five Suns" in the Time Museum in Rockford, Illinois (Nicholson and Quiñones Keber 1983:41-42), the Bilimek Pulque Vessel in the Museum für Vólkerkunde in Vienna (Pasztory 1983:Plates 280, 282), and the "temple stone" in the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico (Pasztory 1983:Plates 125, 127, 130), Nahui Olin with a central "night eye" appears to fall into or be inside Tlalteuctli, the earth monster. On the "Aztec Calendar Stone," a god with features of Tlalteuctli appears in the center of Nahui Olin. Ce celia Klein (1976:12) has identified this figure as Yohualteuctli, "Lord of the Night," a fusion of the night sun and Venus in the middle of the night. Thus, Yohualteuctli is another possible in terpretation of the solar disk represented on Shield 4. The banners associated with this shield are the most complex. The lower banner has a black rectilinear design. The upper ban ner is probably identical except for the red color of the lines. Shield 5 This is the central shield, the most complex, and the axis around which all the others revolve (Figure 9). Here the crossed lances and banners are replaced by: (1) a bundle of four darts; (2) an atlatl, or spear thrower; (3) a rope from which the shield hangs; (4) two flags topped by the butt of a spear or a fire drill; (5) an anthropomorphic biface; and (6) a net bag containing an an thropomorphic biface and from which seven white paper streamers hang. The white band defines the outline of the shield. Within this outline is a yellow background divided by black horizontal lines. The effect of this division is to give the impression that the shield is made of thin yellow horizontal slats bound together by two vertical white bands. Fine black designs on the white bands in dicate that these are made of a woven or twisted material. Two red squares decorate each white band. To the left and right of the white bands are rows of two white circular feather devices or large down balls. Between the bands is a row of three such devices. A bundle of four horizontal darts passes behind the shield. From the down balls on the tip of their anthropomorphic points Figure 9. Shield 5. to the down balls at their butts, the darts are 115.5 cm long. The anthropomorphic points are like those of the lances. In the ac companying illustration, the points are shown without fangs. Close examination after the cleaning of the mural indicates that they too have fangs. The finger holes of the yellow and red atl atl appear just above the shield at the upper left and resemble the face of an owl. The curved shaft of the atlatl extends above the oval grip. The shield is suspended by two ropes decorated with black, red, and white chevrons. This design closely resembles that as sociated with the paths to war in the Mixtee historical codices. The ropes are tied together at the hole in the wall above the shield. The elaborate ends of the ropes resemble stylized red, blue, and yellow flowers. If there was any doubt about the function of the holes in the wall above each shield, it is dispelled by the binding of the two painted ropes above this shield. The holes were for wooden pegs from which actual shields were suspended. Double white banners arise from behind the upper-right quadrant of the shield. The one on the right appears to be solid white and ends in a large down ball. The one on the left is white with a wide horizontal red band flanked by two thinner red bands. This second banner ends in a blue, red, and yellow cy lindrical device that recalls a miniature cuauhxicalli seen in pro file. Emerging from this cylindrical device is the butt end of a dart and a feather device. In front of the left banner appears an anthropomorphic biface. Suspended 12.2 cm beneath the lower border of the shield is</page><page sequence="7">A codex-style mural from Tehuacan Viejo 39 an oval net hunter's bag. The bag is suspended from the shield or from something behind the shield by a broad red band 4.5 cm wide. This is bordered by 1.3-cm-wide orange bands. The pe rimeter of the bag consists of an outer orange band and an in ner red band. The field within the bag is blue. Black details on the blue ground indicate the woven nature of fie net bag. Black and white eagle feathers surround the bag. Within ihe bag is an anthropomorphic blade that is poorly preserved with details dif ficult to discern. Scratch marks on the surface of the mural at this point suggest that the defacing of the blade was intentional. The general context in which this blade occurs suggests that it is a sacrificial blade and that the prey sought by the hunter is probably a human sacrificial victim. Seven white paper streamers decorated with small red circles hang from the bottom of the bag. Each streamer is approxi mately 35.0 cm long and expands from 3.7 cm at the top to 5.8 cm at the bottom. Although many of the red circles are faded, there appear to have been 7 circles per strip, 49 circles in all. Smaller red dots surround each circle. The effect is that of a splattering of red liquid around each drop. That this red substance is blood, the blood of the human sacrifice, is a logi cal identification. The paper streamers violate the boundary between the up per and lower wall zones. They are painted on both the upper mud plaster and the lower stucco plaster. This scheme unites the two zones both visually and conceptually just as the streamers from the upper banner of Shield 1 united the fields on the west and north walls. The large red circles on the lower stucco zone are comparable to those on the paper streamers hanging from the net bag. Both are drops of sacrificial blood on paper. The combination of circular shield with a bundle of darts, and a sacrificial banner is common in the codices. In the Codex Borgia (Nowotny 1976), it occurs with Tezcatlipoca (pp. 17, 35, 42), Xipe Totee (pp. 25, 49), Mixcoatl (p. 25), Tlaloc (p. 25), Tlahuizcalpanteuctli (pp. 45, 49), Tepeyollotl (p. 63), and Hue huecoyotl (p. 64). In his commentary, Seler (1963:1:111) inter prets this set of elements as yaoyotl, the hieroglyph for war. The glosses in the Codex Mendoza (Galindo y Villa 1979:Folios 2v, 5v, 7v, lOr, 13r, 15v) refer to it as "the instruments of war." Elsewhere in the Mendoza (Folio 2r) it is glossed as "Tenoch titlan." The most strikingly similar shield occurs on page 70 of the Codex Borgia. Depicted in front of a jaguar is a shield of yel low slats bound by white cords and decorated with four red squares. Associated with the shield are four darts fletched with black and white eagle feathers. The white banner with three horizontal red bands appears with Xipe Totee (Codex Borgia [Nowotny 1976:24-25, 49, 61]), Tlahuizcalpanteuctli (Codex Borgia [Nowotny 1976:45]), and the mummy bundles on p. 26 of the Codex Borgia. The banner also resembles the back ornament worn by Mictlanteuctli (Co dex Borgia [Nowotny 1976:14, 57]). In the codices, the two ban ners of Shield 5 are associated with death and sacrifice. The owl-shaped atlatl is compatible with these associations. The authors are divided in their opinion as to whether Shield 5 and its symbols are more closely related to those associated with Huitzilopochtli (Lilly) or to those associated with the Camaxtli/ Mixcoatl/Tlahuizcalpanteuctli complex of gods (Sisson). The argument for an association with Huitzilopochtli rests largely on the feather decoration of the shield and the bundle of darts. Marked differences include the hunter's net bag, which does not occur with representations of Huitzilopochtli, and the substitu tion of the owl atlatl for Huitzilopochtli's xiuhcoatl atlatl. The alternative argument that the association is with the Camaxtli/Mixcoatl/Tlahuizcalpanteuctli complex is based on the presence of the hunter's net bag and the similarity to the yaoyotl symbol associated with Tlahuizcalpanteuctli in the the Codex Borgia (Nowotny 1976:49). Although these alternative associations are not necessarily mutually exclusive, they do imply quite different histories. The first alternative would suggest a much stronger Culhua Mexica influence since Huitzilopochtli was their tribal deity. Shield 6 The design of this shield is the most geometric of all the shields and the most difficult to interpret (Figure 10). The circular field is divided vertically into two halves. The left half is red, the right half black. Inscribed within the circle and visually superimposed on the red and black fields is a white diamond. The diamond is divided vertically into two equal right triangles. Concentric arcs on the white ground radiate from the acute angles of each triangle. The arcs on the left side are black and those on the right are red, reversing the color pattern of the background. The four largest arcs have a scalloped edge. A second set of arcs is arranged along the line bisecting the diamond. The color pat tern of these arcs matches that of the background, red on the left and black on the right. These smaller arcs are solid on the upper half of the triangles' common side. Groups of three dots on the white ground of the diamond are the same color as the arcs bounding the areas where the dots occur. The lances and banners accompanying Shield 6 are the mir ror image of those accompanying Shield 2. Shields 2, 4, and 6 are all divided into red and black halves. The same may be true for Shield 8. Figure 10. Shield 6.</page><page sequence="8">40 Sisson and Lilly Shield 7 The circular field is divided in half vertically (Figure 11). The left half has a yellow ground on which open black circles and ellipses alternate. This represents a jaguar skin. Three large styl ized jewels painted blue, red, and yellow with fine details in black are superimposed on the skin to indicate that it is precious. The right half is divided into 44 complete and partial squares separated from one another by a grid of white (?) lines. The ground color of these squares is black. Inscribed within each square is a circle with two small concentric circles at its center. The upper half of each circle is painted red. The lower half may have been painted white. These circles are stylized stars —"night eyes" —in a dark night sky. Dividing the jaguar skin and "night eyes" is a narrow white band with fine diagonal black lines that slant down from left to right. This band represents the fringe of fine fur on the jaguar's belly and limbs. Jaguars are depicted with this fringe both in the codices and on "codex-style" pottery. The pairing of the jaguar skin and "night eyes" suggests that the referent of this shield is Tepeyollotl, "Heart of the Moun tain." See, for example, Codex Borgia (Nowotny 1976:63), where Tepeyollotl as the jaguar is depicted sitting atop a hill or mountain within which the night sky with "night eyes" is vis ible. Tepeyollotl is part of the Tezcatlipoca complex of deities (Nicholson 1971:Table 3). He is the warrior as skilled stalker of his human prey, a captive sacrificial victim. The lances and banners accompanying Shield 7 are the mir ror image of those associated with Shield 3. Shield 8 Only the right half of Shield 8 is preserved (Figure 12). The other half was destroyed by the construction of the stairway as sociated with the third and last construction stage. The ground color of the preserved portion of the shield is black. A white St. Andrew's cross is inscribed within the circle and superimposed Figure 11. Shield 7. Figure 12. Shield 8. on the black background. There is a red "T" with thick cross piece at the end of each arm. In the center where the arms meet is an oval. The details of the shield design, lances, and banners are not preserved. Seler (1992a:99, 110-111) has suggested that there is an association between the St. Andrew's cross design and both the night sky and the costume of dead warriors. North Wall With the exception of the ends of the streamers attached to the upper banner of Shield 1, there is no painted design on the burnt-sienna ground of the north wall. There is a round hole in the center of the wall at the same height as the holes above the painted shields. East Wall When the east wall was cleaned by restorers from the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia, small fragments of paint were found on the burnt-sienna ground. The fragments were so small that it was impossible to determine the features of the design. Columns and Doorjambs The same division into upper and lower zones is continued on the columns and doorjambs of the eastern entrance to the room. Contiguous with the stucco floor, the lower zone is approxi mately 75 cm high. On the northern jamb and the two columns, the upper zone reaches a height of 1.54 m. This may indicate the height of the lintel over the doorway. The upper zone on the southern jamb was destroyed by the construction of the stairway. Nine horizontal bands are painted on the upper zone of the northern jamb and the columns. From top to bottom, the color sequence of the bands is as follows: yellow, red, blue, yellow, red, blue, red, brown, and red. Most of the bands are approx imately 7.0 cm in height. The exceptions are the upper and lower red bands. The upper red band is 21.4 cm high, the lower 17.4 cm high.</page><page sequence="9">A codex-style mural from Tehuacan Viejo 41 The bands wrap around the columns. An unpainted gap 46.0 cm wide separates the ends of the bands on the back or west side of each column. Superimposed on the painted bands on the northern and southern sides of each column are unpainted strips, 3.5 cm wide, which fan out from a vertical axis at the front of the column. These unpainted strips are part of elabo rate designs on the front or east side of the columns not yet ex posed by excavation. The lower red band is painted on both the upper and lower zones and marks the boundary between them. Complex designs hang from this lowest band (Figures 13 and 14). These pendant designs are repeated on the door jambs and on the north and south sides of each column. Although they vary in their details, they are basically similar. The upper portion of each pendant design is composed of two horizontal bands, each 7.5 cm high. The details of the up per band are difficult to discern. The lower band is divided in half. A vertical sky band is depicted on the right half. This sky band is composed of a red band, a yellow band, and a blue band twice as high as each of the others. Superimposed on the blue band are three "night eyes." On the left half is a vertical band outlined in yellow and decorated with red and white diagonal stripes and a blue jewel. Hanging from the left of this band are two red and white ties on a blue ground. This motif is repeated at the bottom of the left streamer below. Hanging at a slight angle from the lower horizontal band are two vertical streamers 7.5 cm wide. Each streamer is divided horizontally into compartments or fields. On both doorjambs, the upper field of the left streamer has a stylized, blue butter fly measuring 7.0 cm from head to tail. The upper field on the right streamer of the northern jamb is divided vertically into simple blue and yellow areas. The comparable field on the southern jamb contains a "winged night eye." The "pupil" is yel low on a white circular ground. Above the pupil is a thin yel low band; higher still, the rest of the "eye" is red and topped with red "wings." Beneath each of these upper fields, there is a design consist ing of four white horizontal elements bound by vertical red bands. In the center they show four white circles. These bound bundles are similar to the knotted ties on the limbs of Xipe Totee and sacrificial victims. Below the bundles on the right streamer of the southern jamb there is a white, cut-shell design 5.0 cm wide. There are red dots at each end of the shell. On the left streamer is a yellow rect angle divided vertically into white, red, and black areas. Simi lar rectangles appear on the right cheek of Xochipilli (pp. 13, 15, 24) and of Centeotl (p. 57) in the Codex Borgia (Nowotny 1976). A rectangle with the colors reversed (black, red, and white) occurs on the left cheek of Piltzinteuctli (p. 14), Xochipilli (p. 16), and Tlazolteotl (p. 16), Centeotl's consort (p. 57). This last pattern also occurs on the right cheek of Pil tzinteuctli in the Codex Cospi (Nowotny 1968:1). On the northern jamb, there is a yellow rectangle with cir cles at the corners on the left streamer. On the right streamer occurs a yellow oval with circles at the "corners" and with two red and white blades inside. Below the yellow rectangle on the northern jamb is a band outlined in yellow and decorated with red and white diagonal stripes and a blue jewel. A red and white tie with red and white tassels hangs from this band. The tie and the tassels are painted on a blue ground. Below the oval on the right streamer is a yel Figure 13.

The color sequence of the ground colors on the two streamers —blue, yellow, red — is the same as that of the sky bands on the lower horizontal band</page><page sequence="10">42 Sisson and Lilly Figure 14. South door ¡amb. above. This would appear to indicate that the pendant stream ers are celestial phenomena, that they hang in the heavens. The nine horizontal bands represent the colored layers of heaven. As Nicholson (1971:406-407) notes, "at the Spanish contact, a 13-level scheme seems to have been standard . . . [but there are] various references to a nine-tiered scheme ... a no tion which may have been more ancient." Nicholson goes on to suggest that these 9 heavenly layers may have once been related to the nine Lords of the Night. These heavenly layers are illus trated on pp. lv and 2r of the Codex Vaticanus 3738 (1979). The red, yellow, and blue sky bands with their stylized stars probably represent the colorful sky of the morning or the eve ning when the stars are visible. Since the doorway is on the east, a reference to the early morning sky seems more likely. The bands with red and white diagonal stripes and the red and white bound bundles are reminiscent of the knotted ties worn at the knees by Xipe Totee. The human skulls with their holes for stringing on the tzompantli (skull rack) and the red and white flint knives reinforce and expand this sacrificial theme. Given the other motifs on the jambs and columns, the contents of the mural, and the holes in the wall, it seems reasonable to associate the stylized blue butterfly and the "winged night eye" with the souls of warriors who died in battle. If one ascends to the heavens by entering the room, which of the 13 or 9 layers is represented by the room? If the stylized butterfly and the "winged night eye" are the souls of dead war riors, then it is almost certainly the fourth layer, the heaven of Tonatiuh, the Centzon Huitznahua, and the quail, the sacrifi cial bird par excellence (Nicholson 1971:Table 2). Of course, if the room is the fourth layer of the heavens, then the nine col ored bands on the jambs and columns may well represent Lay ers 5 through 13. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Entering the room, one passes between the door jambs and col umns with their colored bands and pendant streamers and sym bolically ascends into the heavens. More specifically, one ascends to the fourth layer of heaven, the heaven dominated by the sun god Tonatiuh. Once in the room, the viewer is con fronted by the lower zone, which represents a broad white sac rificial paper with its blood red circles. Above this on the upper zone are the nine shields, crossed lances, banners, darts, and at latl. These are crucial for understanding the significance of the room. From right to left, the probable associations of the shields are as follows: (1) Xipe Totee; the Red Tezcatlipoca; (2) the Red and the Black Tezcatlipocas (?); the feather device of the sacrificial victim, of Mixcoatl; (3) the red "bull's eye" shield of Xipe Totee; (4) atl-tlachinolli, the visual metaphor for war flowing from the night sun, early morning sun, or Yohualteuctli; (5) a second symbol for war, for yaoyotl; the shield of Camaxtii/Mixcoatl/Tlahuizcalpanteuctli or of Huitzilopochtli; the war path; the seven white paper strips with the blood of sac rifice; the anthropomorphic blade of sacrifice; (6) another pos sible reference to the Red and the Black Tezcatlipocas (?); (7) Tepeyollotl; the jaguar god of the night and an aspect of Tez catlipoca; (8) partially destroyed and of undetermined associ ation; and (9) totally missing. In general, the associations of the shields are with warfare, sacrifice, penitence, and the heavens. The function of the room is problematical, as is the signifi cance of the shields with their lances and banners. There are a number of possibilities, not all of which are mutually exclusive. The discussion above suggests that the individual shields are as sociated with specific gods. It is possible that the objects were used by god impersonators and that the room was a storage and vesting room for such individuals. Another possibility is that the shields belonged to individual warriors or different warrior so cieties. The room may have been an armory where the warriors or a society stored weapons. A third possibility is that the shields represent different towns conquered by the Teohuaque warriors. In this case, the room would have been more like a trophy room. Further analysis of the mural may shed light on the possible significance of the shields and the function of the room. The list of possibilities above is not exhaustive. More important in seek ing to answer these questions will be the excavation of the other rooms around the sunken patio to the east. Until the archaeo logical context of the room is better understood, questions as</page><page sequence="11">A codex-style mural from Tehuacan Viejo 43 to the function of the room and the meaning of the shields are likely to remain unanswered. Our tentative interpretation of the function and symbolism of the room is that it was an armory and that it symbolized the heavenly abode of warriors. Symbolically, the room is the abode of warriors in the heaven of the night sun. From the doorway, the actual warrior would watch to see the early morning sun be gin to rise over the mountain range to the east; he would pick up his shield and thrusting lance similar to the fancy, ceremo nial ones depicted on the wall behind him; and he would sally forth to do battle. During his preparation, he might sing a song such as the one to Cihuacoatl as female warrior recorded by Sa hagún's informants (Seler 1992b:273). The morning has dawned, the command for war has gone forth, the morning has dawned, the command for war has gone forth, (captives) may be dragged along. As the warrior passed through the portal between the jambs and columns with their brightly colored bands, he would be reas sured that should he die in battle that day he would ascend to the heavenly abode of Tonatiuh. He would accompany Tona tiuh on his daily journey from sunrise to midday. Having per formed this privileged service for a time, he would then descend to earth in the form of a hummingbird, or of a blue butterfly, to rest and to suck the nectar of flowers. RESUMEN Durante de las excavaciones en el sitio postclásico tardío de Tehuacán Viejo, Puebla, México, un cuarto con un mural en el estilo-códice fue descubierto. El cacicazgo de Tehuacán fue fundado en el siglo XIII por los teohuaques, uno de los grupos de Nonoalco-Chichimeca, refugiados del gran capital de los toltecas, Tula. Conquistados por los aztecas en la década de 1460, los teohuaques ofrecieron su lealtad a los españoles en 1520. En la década de 1530, frailes franciscanos fundaron una igle sia al pie de la mesa donde estaba Tehuacán. En la década de 1570, se trasladaron la iglesia unos 5 km al sitio actual de Tehuacán. El cuarto con el mural era enterado abajo de dos estructuras más re cientes. Aunque la última estructura estaba ocupada en la época colo nial temprano, todas las estructuras estaban construidas en el postclásico tardío. El mural tiene dos zonas horizontales. La zona de abajo está com puesta de una capa de estuco sobre adobes y está decorada con círculos rojos. La zona de arriba está compuesta de una capa de lodo y esta decorada con siete y media escudos con lanzas y banderas cruzadas atrás. Originalmente, había nueve escudos. Uno y media escudos y la parte sur del cuarto fueron destruidos cuando construyeron la última estruc tura. El primer escudo de la derecha tiene la figura de Xipe Totee, el Tezcatlipoca Rojo. Posibles asociaciones de los otros escudos de la derecha a la izquierda son Tezcatlipoca, Xipe Totee, Tonatiuh, Camaxtli, Tezcatlipoca, Tepeyollotl, y desconocido. Arriba de cada es cudo hay una perforación para una clavija de madera donde colgaban escudos verdaderos. Las jambas y las dos columnas de la puerta están decoradas con nueve bandas pintadas que representan las niveles del cielo. Colgando de estas bandas hay banderas. Incluidas en las decoraciones de las ban deras hay estrellas estilizadas y mariposas azules. Estas estrellas y mariposas representan las almas de los guerreros muertos en batalla. Simbólicamente, el cuarto es la morada de estos guerreros. Cuando los guerreros entraron en el cuarto, estaban subiendo al cielo. De la puerta, los guerreros miraron al este para ver la salida del sol. Cuando salió el sol, pusieron las armas y salieron del cuarto. Pasando por la puerta con sus bandas, recordaban que si murieran en la batalla ascen derían al cielo del sol, de Tonatiuh. La función más probable del cuarto era como un arsenal. Se necesi tan más excavaciones para determinar el contexto arqueológico del cuarto.
