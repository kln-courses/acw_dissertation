<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HUMANISM OF RODIN AND LIPCHITZ1 Albert Elsen The sculpture of Jacques Lipchitz since the 1930's has more than a little in common with the sculpture of Rodin. It is the intention of this arti- cle to examine the ideas and sculpture of these two great artists in an effort to establish certain major characteristics which they seem to share. Although in the past each has been considered a radical modern when judged by extreme examples, yet both men have expressed their discontent with certain tendencies in the art of their respective times. In some ways they might better be called conservatives for they both were determined to remain in the "great stream of art," to use Lipchitz' own words. Neither showed any interest in interpreting modern science, exploiting the new sculptural media produced by modern technology, nor in extensive development of subject matter that lies outside of the sphere of human activity. In their most success- ful sculptures their primary objective has been the interpretation of humanity and certain of its problems. It is this concern that places them in the "great stream of art" from the Gothic stone carvers to Donatello, Michelangelo and Bernini, and they would doubtless agree that the sources of this stream trace back through ancient art to primitive and prehistoric times. For Lipchitz, the sculpture of Rodin represents the great tradition carried down to modern times, and in Lipchitz, after his early cubist phase, we can trace a change in outlook that has led to an art very close to the humanistic concerns of his precedessor. In a manner somewhat similar to Lipchitz, Rodin, in the late 'seventies, turned against his own youthful work as well as the sculpture of the Paris salons, because it seemed to him that both were too remote from certain serious and essential truths that he saw in life and which he felt had been the inspiring directives of Donatello and Michelangelo. Because the human form remains for Lipchitz as it did for Rodin the basic vehicle for the interpretation of all significant human experience both artists appear to be traditional by comparison with the non-naturalistic sculp- ture of our time. Both have encouraged others to study nature and have avowed that it is the main source of their inspiration. Their concept of nature, however, includes not only the visible world, but also the internal world of feelings and passions. Although each may have been inspired by the changing I would like to thank Professors Meyer Schapiro and Lorenz Eitner for their suggestions in the preparation of this article.

Rodin's Cathedral, a sculpture of two hands clasped in a gesture of prayer may have been simul- taneously an evocation of the great Gothic naves of northern France or of his visits to the forests of Belgium. His Eternal Spring is incarnate as a youthful couple embracing. Lipchitz' clay sketches for his huge Prometheus were in- spired by reminiscences of cloud formations; but as form and idea merged they took the aspects of the Greek myths; again in his Benediction, a voluptuous CAJ XVII 3 248</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 2.

In the opinion of some modern sculptors, content based upon contem- porary political or social subject matter lies outside the scope of sculpture. But on numerous occasions Rodin and Lipchitz have used such themes. Their purpose was never the advocacy of a political party, but they spoke as partisans against injustice and suffering, against any force which assails human dignity. Rodin's Call to Arms was a reflection of his youthful patri- otism, and his Age of Bronze, originally called The Vanquished, was a com- mentary on a disillusioned France after the Franco-Prussian War. Lipchitz 249 Elsen: The Humanism of Rodin and Lipchitz</page><page sequence="4">in his Rape of Europa, Mother and Child and Pilgrim was expressing senti- ments about the trials of Europe and the Jews during World War II. Both sculptors would reject the prevailing notion that it is demeaning or deceitful for a contemporary artist to draw upon literary themes. Rodin's Old Helmet Maker's Wife, from the poem by Francois Villon, or Lipchitz' Orpheus show us how "illustration" can be enriched by the expressive in- terpretation of ideas and images to be found in literature. Neither man accepted the demands for abstract forms and for rejection of subject matter that so many artists have regarded as criteria of modernity. For Rodin, as for Lipchitz, there is no such thing as a modernity that implies a radical depar- ture from the past. They have insisted that ideas worthy of artistic expression are to be found in history without restriction of time, space or medium. The great lesson of the history of art, so passionately proclaimed by both, is that progress and modernity should be conceived in terms of the artist's success in transforming the ideas of human history as they relate to the needs of his age. Each condemned the academic art of his time because its modes as well as its ideas were borrowed from past cultures and needs. Their own sculpture has shown us that modern art need not relegate historical or literary subject matter to the academic hack. The writings and conversations of both reveal their persistent awareness of the formative influence that the totality of their experience played in the creative act and how a broad cultural background deepens the content and value of their art. In our so-called "Age of Science", this orientation toward mankind is of great importance. It has shown us that the concept of heroism in monu- mental sculpture did not end with the Renaissance or the Baroque. But in Rodin and Lipchitz there is a modern heroism. It does not take the form of a definitive triumph of good over evil as in the portals of Gothic cathedrals. Quite frequently these anonymous modern heroes wage an inconclusive struggle against an intangible force as in Rodin's great Thinker (fig. 1) or Lipchitz' disquieting Figure (fig. 2). What has excited these sculptors is the conflict which has engaged the whole being and the energy with which the struggle has been joined. Their sculpture of religious themes is particularly revealing in this respect. Here we discover a sympathy for human frailty, aspirations, fears, conflicts, joys, sorrows. Rodin's lifelong project, The Gates of Hell (fig. 3), is a profound expression of eternal tragedy. Lipchitz has chosen several sub- jects from the Jewish religion (Sacrifice, Prayer, Pilgrim) and one in par- ticular from the Christian, (The Virgin of Assy). His is perhaps a more hopeful view of humanity for in his seemingly tragic figure of Sacrifice and the related Prayer the evolution is from blood sacrifice and superstition to simple prayer. Subsequently in The Virgin of Assy (1948-1954), Lipchitz expresses a Judeo-Christian mysticism. In his Virgin (fig. 4) he has evoked CAJ XVII 3 250</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 3.

Lipchitz, Virgin of Assy, 1948-1954. the spirit of early medieval faith and fantasy, expressed in his own idiom, by the ingenuity of his symbolism and boldness of his forms: the symbol of heaven is a canopy suspended from the dove, beneath which the Virgin's body merges in a suggestive integration with the wings of angels and the recumbent form of the lamb. The sculptural fusion reiterates the transcen- dental union of the theme. It is the product of the sculptor's inner eye; in the spirit of Plotinus he seeks to pierce the veil of appearances and to reveal not the mechanical structure of the universe but the spiritual. To one of the most overworked symbols in the history of art, Lipchitz has given an il- luminating freshness and insight which had been absent in Christian sculp- ture for many centuries. Both sculptors have been moved by the depths and vicissitudes in the history of relations between man and his God and they have sought to em- brace something of its magnitude and profundity-an endeavor rare in mod- ern art. The scope of their effort recalls the epic religious themes of the Baroque period. Bernini's Longinus with his upraised head and outflung CAJ XVII 3 252</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 5. Rodin, Detail from Gates of Hell showing family group. arms is a prophecy of Rodin. Yet in Baroque sculpture the psychological record is incomplete. We have a vast array of saints, martyrs, popes and angels rejoicing in the victories of the Church. As on the Gothic cathedrals, significant human history is the record of religious triumphs. One looks in vain at Baroque portraits for direct evidence of the great spiritual tensions and crises, the doubts that lingered on after the Reformation. To find sculp- ture mirroring the uncertainties and anxieties which accompany religious upheaval and which make their imprint on the face or body, we must go back to Michelangelo and then to the Roman portraits of the third and fourth centuries. Rodin conceived of the Bible not as a basis for dogma but as a moving history of human action, that unites the past with the present. The spiritual anxiety of the inhabitants of The Gates of Hell is timeless. Their predeces- sors can be found in the Bible among those who were without God. John the Baptist is a great work of sculpture not because it is based upon a major figure of the New Testament, but because John is seen as a human being struggling for self-expression. It is not his message that touches us, but rather the image of a man engaged in a total physical, emotional, and intellectual effort required by this self-imposed urgency. Lipchitz moves us in Hagar and her Son not for the plight of Hagar but by the universal theme of a mother and child in distress. The society that produced the authors of works like these has been char- acterized by an increasing awareness of disunity, of conflicting ideologies, economic and social uncertainties, and a loss of stabilizing institutions and 253 Elsen: The Humanism of Rodin and Lipchitz</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 6. Lipchitz, The Return of the Prodigal, 1931. beliefs. In Lipchitz' own words, "Our time is attracted by division." Yet in responding profoundly to the needs of our times they have shown us in their sculpture that in spite of suffering, of tension, of division that there is an essential integrating force which is expressed in the inner life of the in- dividual. Art becomes a means of demonstrating one of the few remaining forms of universal unity and of achieving good will. In this context it is not surprising to find in the sculpture of both men an intimate and emotional interpretation of the private life of the family. Within the Gates of Hell the family is anonymous and is shown as separated or destroyed by acts of the parents themselves. In several areas on the large sculptured door are to be found a mother and child alone, or a child isolated from its parents. The most stirring family group in the Gates is that based upon Dante's Ugolino (fig. 5). In the final form of the door, Rodin divested the figure of the father and his dying sons of the original literary connotation in order to stress the universality and timelessness of the family dilemma. Ugolino is the father culpable of the fatal dissolution of his family through his selfishness, while the children demonstrate their forgiving love by offering their flesh as a means of saving their starving parent. Lipchitz, in addition to his poignant handling of the family theme in the beautiful Mother and Child II, has made it the subject of one of his most moving sculptures, The Return of the CAJ XVII 3 254</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 7. Rodin, The Prodigal Son, before 1889. Prodigal Son (fig. 6). To give form to the emotional outburst of the final reunion, the sculptured shapes of father and son become one unity, indis- soluble. The embracing gesture of the father is carried throughout the body and each movement or curving plane finds a responding movement in the body of the son. The theme of parental love, forgiveness and reunion indi- cates Lipchitz' hope. In contrast to the Renaissance and Baroque Art, there are important sculptures by Rodin and Lipchitz in which man is not shown in a culture- forming activity. Both sculptors executed works in which physical or ethical action is absent. The activity depicted is that of the spirit. Underlying these works is a life-long reflection on unseen, unvoiced forces, on the complexi- ties of man's struggle for mastery of himself. Both men have had impressive results from their emotional survey of the inner life. They have given em- phatic articulation not only to man's strength, but also to his weaknesses. Rodin's Thinker (fig. 1) is a monument to emotional and intellectual con- flict and frustration, to unresolved, unresolvable tension that paralyzes the entire being, confronted by the pressures of life. In Rodin, man himself is the origin of the dilemma and he is the prisoner of his passions. His feelings derive from religious convictions about the incompatibility of the spirit and the flesh. In this respect Rodin is the heir of Michelangelo. Lipchitz too has 255 Elsen: The Humanism of Rodin and Lipchitz</page><page sequence="10">inherited something of this incompatibility although perhaps in his use it derives from Judaic traditions. In his Figure (fig. 2), a powerful example of emotional and intellectual conflict, the naturalistic reference to the physi- cal body has been eliminated. The basis of tension lies not only within the figure; it also arises from invisible external forces, or institutions of society which act upon it. In both of these sculptures the subject is anonymous; in- dividual identity has been negated in an effort to demonstrate the universality of the emotion. Both men have interpreted the theme of frustration and tension as one of compression in which the compactness of the composition translates the idea of the individual's being thrown back upon himself. In The Thinker this intellectual and emotional contraction takes the form of self-enclosure. Tension is suggested not simply by taut muscles, but also by the competing and jarring angles of the arms and legs, surmounted by the weighty curve of the back and the multiple points of contact at which the body touches itself. The chain-like image of Figure is a forceful metaphor, a personal conceptual body image, a moving type of "inscape," which is evoked by the power and indeterminancy of the opposing chain-like forces that reduce it to a state of physical and emotional atrophy. The rhythmic pull of the curved series which leads upward and downward without re- solving itself into a single direction underscores the final immobility of Figure. In neither The Thinker nor Figure do we know the specific cause of the state of being. There is no external frame of reference as in Baroque art, or in contemporary academic sculpture. What contributes to the modernity of these works is their exploration of the state of feeling itself. The subject of both is tension. Rodin and Lipchitz have concentrated upon that aspect of the inner life in which mood or activity know of no origin or fulfillment outside of the self. They have fulfilled a modern need by imaginatively articulating a human dilemma, while not seeking to explain or solve it. In Rodin's so-called Prodigal Son (fig. 7) as in Lipchitz' Mother and Child II the themes are: suffering, isolation, despair. The human form is seen in maximum extension as if the individual seeks to escape from himself or to join spiritually with something unseen. Rodin interprets the Prodigal as the basic theme of man's ultimate loneliness, a state in which he is no longer capable of sharing. Lipchitz' sculpture is a disquieting reminder of modern history which has inflicted unwarranted pain and despair not alone upon man-but upon the source of love and procreation: the mother and child. In both works the figures make an impassioned appeal. When Bernini's Longinus stretches out his arms, it is to embrace Christ, and we feel that his appeal will be answered. The tragedy in these modern sculptures is that the individuals may not comprehend the reasons nor necessity for the ap- peal, nor do they know to whom the plea is to be directed. Another element of spiritual drama is the feeling of resistance to the force of gravity even in their largest, most powerful bodies, as in Rodin's CAJ XVII 3 256</page><page sequence="11">Fig. 8. Lipchitz, Prometheus Stran- gling the Vulture, 1943-1952, Walker Art Center, Minneapolis. . .. ....... . .S W Adam and Lipchitz' Prometheus Strangling the Vulture (fig. 8). They are not reconciled to being earthbound. Their feet may be firmly anchored to the ground, but there is an impression of rebellious upward thrust within the body, a partially felt sense of weightlessness which adds to the spiritual unrest. To the sculpture of the human form, both have given greatly increased flexibility. By comparison with the mediocre representations of the human body in nineteenth century sculpture (with the exception of Daumier and Degas) Rodin's figure style after the 1870's made an enormous advance. Much as Michelangelo had done, Rodin studied the structure of the body and the actual movements of which it was capable. He also explored the possibility of posing it in anatomically difficult if not incredible situations which nevertheless, in the final sculpture, seem plausible expressions of their state of being. His Adam is an example of this technique. Rodin rediscovered in earlier sculpture, such as that of Donatello, and through his own experi- mentation, new and extreme means of working the clay under the effect of light in order to suggest that the flesh was an intimate link with the moving forces beneath it. Concomitantly he gave the human body and its surface textures wider possibilities of articulation and manipulability than in any previous period of sculpture. In accomplishing this, Rodin again looked to the past. Turning from the academic work around him he sought inspira- tion from the late Gothic, the Renaissance and the Baroque. Lipchitz, as a young man, rebelled violently against Rodin's adherence to naturalistic anatomy, to so-called literary values, and to a style of modelling which seemed to him to border on the formless, and under the influence of Cubism he began to conceive a new sculptural language in terms 257 Elsen: The Humanism of Rodin and Lipchitz</page><page sequence="12">of simple volumes and planes. These were fabricated in a unique, coherent, though unpredictable union that was dictated primarily by the sculptor's imagination and the particular order required for each individual sculpture, rather than by the totality of a perceived human form. The result was in- tended to make the work valid in itself, as sculpture, rather than being de- pendent upon extra-artistic associations. The cubist sculpture of Lipchitz was in part a reaction against an esthetic based upon empathy or anthropo- morphic projection whereby the viewer could inject himself into the work and thereby enjoy its "life enhancing" values. In Woman Reading (fig. 9) the structural pattern of the body in a seated posture suggested to Lipchitz a related but more complex rhythmic design so that movement exists not through the action of the limbs, but in the succession of shapes. The meaning of the work, as in Mannerist art, lies largely in its rhythm. In these early cubist works there is also a noticeable stress upon passive states of feeling; physical activity is kept to a minimum. In the 1920's perhaps feeling a need for more emotional content in his work, Lipchitz gradually evolved a style in which the range of human activi- ties became broader and more important. (In an interview with the author he stated that The Joie de Vivre (1927) is the real beginning of his interest in subject matter.) Still the cubist influence remains in his later works (as he has often pointed out). Each sculpture has its own laws of shapes, light, silhouette and rhythmic integration. The result has been a wide range of transformations of the human figure which include wiry transparencies such as The Acrobats, the curving and squared off Seated Figure (a cubist parody of Rodin's Thinker), the massive sensual convexities and globular shapes of Benediction, the weighty, somber and recurving volumes of Mother and Child II, and the bulbous muscularity of Prometheus Strangling the Vulture. He will vary the form according to the mood or identity of his theme. The theme of strength is incarnated in powerfully emerging surfaces, that of sensuality in more languidly swelling shapes, that of divine mysticism asso- ciated with the Virgin in a boneless, arched ribbon-like form with a vertical shadowed inner core. These imaginatively formed bodies have been evolved as projections of his most private sentiments about humanity. "When I am working I am linked to the entire cosmos. By rhythm I am linked to time, by volume I am linked to space, and by subject matter I am linked to human beings, to their sufferings and their joys. And through the feeling of creation, I am bound to Our Lord himself."2 Expressive gesture was used in a masterful way by both artists, but al- 2This statement was made during an interview that Prof. William Rubin of Hunter College and the author had with Lipchitz at his studio in Hastings-on-Hudson, on June 26, 1956. I am indebted to Prof. Rubin for excerpts from the transcript he made of the interview which he had arranged in order to obtain material for his doctoral dissertation on the Church at Assy.

Carleton i:i^a r S College. though it has certain affinities to the Baroque in its climactic poses, we witness a significant element of modernity here. For example, Rodin, in his John the Baptist and The Burghers of Calais, used a transient action as opposed to the finality seen in Bernini's compositions. In The Gates of Hell, Rodin often :'-,"'-'',.'''g! i ' !:?:: : i-ii'E3 311 i: f introduced gestures which revealed the inability of the figures to communicate introducedh others. inability of the figures move hesitatingly, communcertain of their self- with others. Many of the figures move hesitatingly, uncertain of their self- control as if caught up in a web of conflicting and elusive emotions. In Rodin's view there are no definite boundaries of feeling and he sees that a characteristic of modern man's emotional life is its constant flux and instability. There is a perceptibly greater variety and subtlety in Rodin's sculptural gestures than in the art of Lipchitz who perhaps feels a need to present man in a situation where his movements can be more decisive or assertive. In comparison with Rodin's work, the gestures made by Lipchitz' figures are more emphatic and irrevocable, having much of the Baroque love of rhetoric in them as, for example, in the upraised stumps of arms in Mother and Child II. Both artists, as we would expect, have rejected the stock postures of the nineteenth century art academies. Through fresh search they have enriched the use of gesture in sculpture as a means of revealing the rich complexity of the psychological and emotional constitution of human beings in modern life. When he wishes to convey strong feelings, Lipchitz uses large, solid forms in powerful poses such as Prometheus and Benediction; and much the 259 Elsen: The Humanism of Rodin and Lipchitz</page><page sequence="14">same can be said of Rodin's Thinker. These are neither in the Greek athletic ideal nor the streamlined Nordic vein of a Zorach or Mestrovic. Prometheus, like The Thinker, has a brutish quality, an untrained strength and a halting physical coordination, but as sculptures both are always graceful and ultimately more sincere in interpreting man as we know him than the efforts of academic sculptors. There are great resources of strength in mankind which more often than not have failed to be realized or have been misdirected. Prometheus, in strangling the vulture, symbolizes for Lipchitz the triumph of modern man over the evil forces that plague him. The Burghers of Calais like the Prome- theus is an expression of man's heroic transformation of the potentiality of his spirit into positive and elevating acts. The Burghers was intended for a monument to the leading citizens of Calais who in the fourteenth century offered themselves as hostages to the King of England in the hope of sparing their beleaguered city. The Burghers is meant to be a monument to the self- sacrificing heroism of which man has been capable in his history but Rodin is unwilling to show these hostages responding unhaltingly to the call of duty. He sees the pain of self-denial reflected in the taut resignation of the old man and his son, the anguished half-quizzical gesture of another, the grief-engulfed figure clutching his head, the shocked somnambulistic pose of still another, thus he transforms Froissart's chronicle into a breathing sculp- tural commentary. Rodin's heroes are not preterhuman like those on the Sistine Ceiling and the Medici tombs who symbolized for Michelangelo an almost unattainable state of grace. The Burghers are of the same flesh, the same complex of strength and weakness we see in The Thinker, The Prodigal Son and The Gates of Hell. The essentials of life, in the belief of both men, find their motivation in sensual directives. Theirs is a sensuality frankly revealed and enjoyed as in the art of Bernini and Rubens and it reflects an ideal of health and fecundity. The virility of their forms reveals a fundamentally optimistic outlook. In the early period of his art, characterized by his work on The Gates, Rodin saw the body and its passions as the cause and object of man's eternal corruption. In his later art, which reflects his changed outlook upon life, Rodin's figures are freed of moralizing content. They enjoy a pagan state of grace as do so many of the later sculptures of Lipchitz. But Rodin's art frequently contains an eroticism not to be found in the work of the younger man. Rodin, in fact, was obsessed with flesh. He saw it as the mirror of the stirrings of the soul and his art was a tireless evocation of the life of the flesh. Lipchitz arouses our sensual associations through the use of curved suggestive volumes and exaggerated rhythmic contours. Both artists were moved by feelings of "thirst", as Lipchitz puts it. It took many forms as in Rodin's sculpture of Fugitive Love, The Kiss, or Lip- chitz' Song of Songs where the thirst arises from yearnings of physical love CAJ XVII 3 260</page><page sequence="15">and the sculptures suggest amorous union. In Rodin's Je suis belle it is the artist's thirst for beauty which is expressed, or for youth and vitality as in his sculpture of the old woman embracing the young girl on her lap. Lipchitz, in a sensual, but less erotic fashion, exteriorized this feeling of thirst in his powerful handling of the Mother and Child and the Return of the Prodigal Son. Again and again Lipchitz reveals his passionate devotion to the theme of creative energy with which life is formed. Neither sculptor overlooked the possibilities of the human face. The style and psychological interpretations of Rodin's portrait bust of Eugene Guillaume (fig. 10) recall Plotinus' conception of beauty as that which shines forth through ugliness because of the interpretive genius of the artist. Equally revealing is Lipchitz' Head of Marsden Hartley (fig. 11). The bronze surface of these two heads suggest the wear of life and seems to have been formed by the unique personal existence of both men. Both subjects have become vulnerable to an extent not seen in portraiture in the round since Bernini. The surfaces are so transformed that they seem to express an intimate residue of the private existence of the individual. As in the late portraits of Rem- brandt there is a concentrated inner excitement which animates the face. The shaded hollows of the heads link our experience of the exterior man with his inner life, whose extent and profundity are admitted to be without measure by both sculptors. Although both Rodin and Lipchitz conceive of man as a finite being, in their sculptured portraits they neither insist upon nor reveal his physical and mental boundaries. To a surprising degree we may discover a shared aesthetic in the sculp- ture of the two men. On numerous occasions Lipchitz has spoken of his in- debtedness to Rodin for revealing to him the expressive potentialities of light upon properly disposed volumes. It is light on bronze surfaces, gently paced by a succession of reflecting orbs and absorbent shadows, or ignited into a series of electrifying highlights that gives fire to their art and excites the forms to heave into breath. The sculptural textures of The Old Helmet Maker's Wife, the Walking Torso, or of Lipchitz' Theseus and The Return of the Prodigal Son are neither naturalistic nor always familiar. The modelling is executed by thumb strokes and gouging fingertips, or by sharp indentation of knife cuts. The bronze is often scarred by file scratching instead of polished finish. Both sculptors retain in the final work some sign of action of their hands so that we are continually reminded of the presence of the artist. (Lip- chitz sometimes signs his work with a thumb print.) This "incomplete" and suggestive style gives the forms a more spontaneous and improvised quality, enabling us to sense the decisions made by the artist as he built up to the final form. Their large sculptures reveal countless touches so that we become aware of an intimate play between the minute and the massive. The color of the bronze, with its rich variety of patina as well as endless capacity for re- 261 Elsen: The Humanism of Rodin and Lipchitz</page><page sequence="16">Fig. 10. Rodin, Portrait Bust of Eugene ! Guillaume, 1903. fleeting light, have been exhaustively explored by both. They have accepted the innate differences between flesh and metal and in their more daring con- ceits such as Rodin's Prodigal Son or Lipchitz' Virgin of Assy in the gilded version, the coloristic surface of the bronze, liberated from naturalistic ties, produces a stimulating visual effect. Always conscious of the need for variety within a single work, the two artists have constantly included in their art an unexpected play between large and small measured sections held together by ingenious transitional areas. Often this shift in measure is accompanied by a counterpoint of tiny excited passages of light set against larger, more leisurely movement of illumination. In walking around such sculptures as Europd and the Bull or John the Baptist there are endless delights in silhouette changes and new patterns of light and shadow. The spatial intervals between solids are rarely dull as they sometimes are in Maillol. Everything appears to be in movement, and each part is seen in relation to the next. They regarded this not only as good sculptural tech- nique, but also as a life principle. Finally, we should take consideration of certain important dissimilarities between the two men. Rodin, who lived until 1917, contributed to some of the most revolutionary and exciting years of modern art. Unlike Lipchitz, however, he was not influenced by the radical new developments in painting and sculp- shadow. The spatial intervals between solids are rarely dull as they sometimes.:: CAJ XVII 3 262</page><page sequence="17">Fig. I1. Lipchitz, Head of Mars- den Hartley, 1942. ture. (I do not subscribe, for example, to the prevalent view that Rodin was seriously influenced by Impressionist painting.) Rodin's art represents the end phase of the tradition extending from late medieval art down through the nineteenth century during which time the rendition of the human form was based upon the experience of the outward senses. In line with this tradition, Rodin concentrated upon achieving qualities and surfaces that suggested flesh and skeletal structure, pulse and muscular tension. Throughout his lifetime he thought of expression generally in terms of physiognomic and body move- ment. "Geometry" was a word he occasionally used after 1900 in describing such sculptures as his Burghers of Calais. Geometry, however, was only , catalyst, if not an afterthought. It did not alter the naturalistic appearance of his figures. If mathematics played any part in his sculpture, which may be doubted, it did so in the manner of the Greeks, as a proportional determinant. All of his imagination was channeled into a single form which was based upon the perceptual and familiar experience of his audience. In his most drastic sculptures Rodin never departs from the tradition of Donatello, Michel- angelo and Bernini. Lipchitz at a very early stage in his career responded to the climactic changes in painting and sculpture, perhaps even those of architecture, and he 263 Elsen: The Humanism of Rodin and Lipchitz</page><page sequence="18">eagerly participated in the cubist breakthrough of the human form barrier. Prior to Cubism, sculptors since the late Middle Ages, solved the basic prob- lem of harmonious arrangement of the parts of the human body which in nature may have lacked esthetic order, by thickening or thinning limbs, lengthening or shortening the torso. Changes were made in bodily measure. In his cubist sculpture, Lipchitz, just as Archipenko, Picasso and Gris, em- ployed plastic and structural equivalents of the human body which though still based upon anatomical knowledge were not derived from sensory ex- perience. In constructing his sculpture of smooth, quasi-geometrical volumes, sharp angles and rectilinear or diagonal conjunctions of component units, Lipchitz, like the cubist painters, rejected almost all of the physical properties of the human body. It was a new, conceptual vocabulary, entirely creative and totally opposed to the imitative. Recognition of the human form was suggested by minimal references to portions of the silhouette and the orientation of a seated or standing figure. This momentous severance from centuries of sculp- tural tradition was largely responsible for the successive and changing phases of Lipchitz' work, his plurality of modes, and their distinguishing differences from the art of Rodin. The principles rather than the forms of Cubism per- mitted his imagination and intimate feelings to be clothed in private forms and symbols that are remote from the language of Rodin and from most of the public. The suggestive vegetal or flame-like shapes that comprise the body of Lipchitz' Pilgrim, the strong imaginative floral forms of Blossoming, and his myriad human but non-physical metaphors are unthinkable in Rodin's art. Lipchitz has been continually touched by the influence of modern imagi- native painting that places no limitations on the manipulation of the body or source of imagery. While Rodin may have never felt that his active imagina- tion was restricted by the human form, for Lipchitz, recourse to other forms has meant an unlimited number of possibilities that could bring the final work of art closer to the source and to the intimacy of his thought. There is a significant contrast to be found in some of their titles. In Rodin we find such nominations as Fallen Caryatid, or Orpheus and the Menades; in Lipchitz we encounter some of the familiar mythological subjects, but also such strange titles as: Ploumanach, Chimene and Song of the Vowels. Metamorphosis was an important theme for Rodin and it continued to be for Lipchitz. But in Rodin's Man and His Thought, the metamorphosis is from one distinct and verifiable form to another. In the case of Lipchitz, the transmutation of thought derives from the artist's associative responses to images, to feelings or memory that cannot be verbalized, easily defined, or retraced. The continuing fruitfulness of Lipchitz' art may in part derive from the availability of areas for exploration that he and the art of his time have opened for the artist. Witness his latest interest in "automatics." While Rodin worked in somewhat the same fashion after 1900, as pointed out by Lipchitz himself, CAJ XVII 3 264</page><page sequence="19">he did not carry over these exciting experiments and discoveries into his large sculptures. To supplement the inheritance of twentieth century art, as well as the legacy of Rodin, Lipchitz has drawn heavily upon his Jewish background. Whereas Rodin's religious art or spiritual themes derive from the Western European Catholic tradition and ancient Hellenism, Lipchitz' art is strongly rooted in the Old Testament and Jewish traditions, along with his interest with the occult, and in religious customs of early societies. Rodin's views in- clined more towards the Greek anthropomorphic tradition. Some of Lipchitz' imagery is closer to the spirit of primitive idols with their crude power and mystical, awesome presence. Such sculptures as Prayer and Sacrifice are formed of values that are supramundane and correspond to the apprehension of the physical world found in primitive societies. His Virgin of Assy is not a god- dess of the Renaissance but belongs rather to some early medieval cult. Although Lipchitz' art since 1940 has come closer both in spirit and form to that of Rodin, it bears the indelible reminiscence and lesson of his previous experience. The faceting and formal ligatures, for example, of the Head of Marsden Hartley, or Theseus, show us what Lipchitz means when he says that at heart he is still a cubist sculptor. The influence of these two sculptors has been significant not only in terms of their sculpture, but also in the personal example they have set for other artists. Both have found an important precedent for the sculptor by dealing with situations that affect human beings now by means of a style rooted in the artist's unique experience. The gift of these two men to their contempo- raries is not that of prophecy, nor an escape from reality. They have nothing new to say that has not been said by others of their time. Their peculiar gift is a sculptured style by means of which they have given expression to the atti- tude of man confronted by modern life. They have provided our age with a conscience. Today we are discovering new things about the mind and body, and man is being put into situations which are without precedent. Through the revelations of their art, Rodin and Lipchitz have demonstrated their belief that there is still a basic unity in human experience. While the plastic arts are admirably expanding their form and content, the value of the sculptor's interpretation of himself and his society has not diminished. Both Rodin and Lipchitz have exercised their right and privilege to criticize their times and we can rejoice that this has been done constructively and with good will. 265 Elsen: The Humanism of Rodin and Lipchitz</page></plain_text>
