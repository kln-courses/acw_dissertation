<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Chapter 8: Excavations at Upside-Down-Man  8  ExCAvATIONS AT UPSIDE-DOWN-MAN This chapter details the excavation of Upside-Down-Man (UDM) shelter in the lower Mangrove  Creek catchment, north of  the Hawkesbury River  (Figure 8.1). The  site contains an extensive  pigment art assemblage with several phases of production. Also present are all three shelter  engraving types (pecked, Sydney miniature and abraded), thought to be diachronic indicators  in shelter art production (McDonald 1991). Dripline scours initially indicated that there was  occupation evidence at the site. The site was test excavated in September 1991. A total of 12  person days was spent testing the site. figure 8.1: locality map. udm Shelter in its local context. terra australis 27 171 </page> <page sequence="2"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange environmental context The site is located on the hillslope 300m from the confluence of Ironbark Creek and one of its  minor eastern tributaries. The site is 50m from and 20m in elevation above the tributary creek.  There is a spring c.50m upstream of the shelter on the tributary creek and a smaller spring at the  southern end of the shelter. While the understorey and surrounding vegetation were extremely dry  at the time of the excavation, both of these springs were producing water - in sufficient quantities  to feed a waterfall.    The confluence of Ironbark Creek and Mangrove Creek is less than 10km upstream of the  junction with the Hawkesbury River. Tidal estuarine mudflats occur in the lower reaches and at  the mouth of Mangrove Creek less than 3km from Ironbark Creek (Figure 8.1).   The shelter bedrock is of the Hawkesbury Sandstone formation and the shelter is  surrounded by dry sclerophyll forest. Dominant tree species include a variety of Eucalyptus spp.  and Angophora spp., while the mid-storey contains many wattles, Geebung (Persoonia spp.) and  grevilleas.  The Site The shelter is large and cavernously weathered, measuring 17m x 6m x 3.5m (Figure 8.2, Figure  8.3; Figure 8.4). It has a westerly aspect. The archaeological components of the shelter include  art (engravings, paintings, drawings and stencils) and occupation deposit (including lithics, ochre,  faunal and floral remains, shellfish and charcoal). Outside the shelter on a sloping sandstone ramp  there are numerous grinding grooves. On the platform roof above the shelter there is an engraved  macropod.  The Art A moderately large assemblage of 274 motifs was recorded within the shelter. Most of these are  black, red and/or white drawings (Table 8.1). A complex range of artistic techniques has been  employed at the site. One simple-non-figurative motif on Panel 4 is polychrome (black, white and  yellow). Of the 58 technique variables identified in detailed diachronic work in Mangrove Creek,  36 are present at Upside-Down-Man (Table 8.2). Of the 66 sites recorded in detail around the  Mangrove Creek area, in Upper Mangrove Creek (Attenbrow 2004, Gunn 1979) and in the Warre  Warren area (McDonald 1988a), only one shelter has a larger assemblage. That site is Swinton’s,  with a motif total of 857 including 575 hand stencils.  Stencils Fifty-five stencils were recorded amongst the UDM assemblage. Of these, 36 were of hands and  18 were of hand variations (hand and wrist, hand and arm, finger manipulation). The majority was  white (90%) with the remainder red (7%) or yellow (2%).   Most (67%) of the 36 hand stencils were of left hands, a fair proportion (22%) were  indeterminate and four only were of right hands. Only half of the 18 hand stencils variations  were of left hands while a larger proportion (39%) was of right hands. Only two of these were  indeterminate. While for a fair proportion of the stencils ‘handedness’ is no longer recognisable  (owing to pigment flaking, fading etc.), left hands appear to have been stencilled more often than  right hands.  This pattern generally holds for the white stencils [(67%) were of left hands, (18%) were  of right hands and (16%) were indeterminate] but not for the minor colours. Half of the four red  stencils were indeterminate and there was one each of the right and left hands. The one yellow  stencil was of a right hand. While these coloured stencils provide too small a sample to make  much of comparative preferences, the nature of the red stencils indicates a greater antiquity for  this technique (i.e. red stencilling). The pigment in these examples has bonded with the rock and  terra australis 27 172 </page> <page sequence="3"> Chapter 8: Excavations at Upside-Down-Man figure 8.2: udm Shelter.

Most of the pigment art is in good condition, although there is evidence for exfoliation  postdating some art production and predating a later phase in Panel 5. There is also deterioration  (cracking, spalling and exfoliation) of the case-hardened surface in Panel 1.  Engravings A number of petroglyphs occur within the shelter. Three of these are engraved male anthropomorphs.

The pecked motifs beneath Panels 1 and 5 cannot, because of  their  locations  (Figure 8.2), be  directly correlated with the pigment tradition. As stated above, two of these motifs are pecked  (intaglio), and the other is a miniature (pecked and abraded) outline engraving. The pecked  intaglio male figures would appear to be related to an earlier transitional phase of art production  in the region. This has been dated at Yengo 1 to the pre-Bondaian (this volume). There is a small  number of sites with this earlier art style recorded in the Mangrove Creek area (at 11 sites; 17%).  In all other instances the art consists of tracks (bird and macropod), circles, and pecked pits or  dots.  figure 8.5: udm Shelter.

The  inverted man beneath Panel 1 has an infilled circular head and stick body and limbs (Figure 8.5).  While the feet are depicted as open ovals (mundoes), both hands have three fingers, reminiscent  of bird tracks. Some of the red, early wet infilled anthropomorphic depictions at the site (Panel 5)  also have three fingers on their hands. The other intaglio male figure also has a solid circular head,  but no digits appended to the limbs (Figure 8.5, Figure 8.7). These motifs will be further discussed  in terms of the art phases identified at the site. Change over time Ongoing surface exfoliation as well as superimposition evidence at the site indicates several art  production episodes. While the pecked and outline engravings cannot be related to any particular  phase of pigment art production at the site by direct association, there are several pigment  terra australis 27 176 </page> <page sequence="7"> Chapter 8: Excavations at Upside-Down-Man Figure 8.6: Panel 2 (above) and Panel 3.

Red anthropomorphs (one with white outline) beneath white  outlined macropods. techniques (and motifs) which are consistently beneath others and are interpreted as being older  than the majority of the art. Incised motifs also occur in superimposition relationships with other  techniques, and as indicated above, appear relatively late in the art sequence (Figure 8.10, Figure  8.11).   The diachronic analysis used with the Mangrove Creek shelter sites was used at UDM  to explore intra-site diachronic variability. Eighteen techniques occur in superimposition  relationships at UDM (Table 8.2), and the general sequence identified for Mangrove Creek (Table  terra australis 27 178 </page> <page sequence="9"> Chapter 8: Excavations at Upside-Down-Man figure 8.10: udm panel 2. detail of incised macropods over black charcoal macropods. 8.3) was found here also (Table 8.4). The variable numbers used (Table 8.2) relate to the more  comprehensive list identified (Table 11.1; chapter 11).    Phases 1 and 2 show distinct separation in motif preferences from Phase 3 (Chapter 9). This  is interpreted as indicating that Phases 1 and 2 are temporally discrete from each other and from  Phase 3. Phase 3 represents most of the art in the Mangrove Creek area and is characterised by a  proliferation of artistic techniques.    Superimposition relationships were recorded at the site (Figure 8.6, Figure 8.8 and Figure  8.9). This was not quantified, i.e. recording every example (cf. Morwood 1979), but indicatively,  i.e. recording presence/absence of trends (Table 8.4).   White hand stencils provide the best evidence for the contemporaneity of much of the  assemblage and/or the ubiquity of this technique. White hand stencils occur above and below  many of the techniques which do not occur in other superimposition relationships. White hand  stencils occur over black infilled and outlined and infilled motifs, red o/i, white o/i, wet white  outlined and infilled motifs, white + red o/i motifs and red hand stencils. White hand stencils have  been drawn over by red infilled motifs, wet and dry black + white o/i motifs and wet white outline  motifs.   On the basis of close visual inspection, these appear to be generally contemporaneous. All  appear to be of roughly the same coloured pigment, and the expertise indicated by the user(s) of  the technique across the site is consistent. Weathering varies slightly, mainly as a result of the  varying degrees of protection afforded to the different art panels.   At UDM, Mangrove Creek Art Phase 2 is represented by the solid red painted anthropomorphs  and goannas and red hand stencils on Panel 5.

The red hand stencils - which are completely bonded to the sandstone matrix - are beneath  white hand stencils. In Panel 2, two red and white bichrome anthropomorphs are beneath black  drawings and white hand stencils. In Panel 4, the incised motifs are on top of several types of  black drawings, which are in turn beneath several white painted motif types.   These superimposition relationships indicate temporal trends and also indicate certain  colour relationships. Black and/or red monochrome motifs are never placed over white ones  (either wet or dry), although white was placed often over red and/or black motifs. Black was never  drawn over white hand stencils, although the converse did occur. Many of these superimposed  colour relationships may result from visibility considerations. Colour avoidances, however, may  also be operating.   The assemblage at UDM is interpreted as consisting primarily of elements from Art Phases  2 and 3. The pecked motifs may be from Phase 1, although based on motif analyses (chapter  10) these are interpreted as transitional and are therefore conservatively placed in Phase 2. The  majority of the UDM art falls in Art Phase 3, with several techniques (namely dry and wet red  outline) which occur consistently late in the phase also present.   Given this art sequence, the excavations at the site aimed to determine whether there were  multiple occupation phases at the site, and their temporality.  Art Dates Four  samples  from  two  charcoal macropod  drawings were  collected  for AMS  dating  (Figure  8.12). These samples were processed by John Head (ANU Quaternary Dating Research Centre)  and the counting was completed at the ANSTO Facility at Lucas Heights. The following dates  were received (Table 8.5).  Table 8.5: udm Shelter. AmS dates from the two macropod motifs.  Sample No. Field Number Motif #  Date ANU-AMS 773 UDM/1  1 c.480 + 80 BP ANU-AMS 774 UDM/2  1 indistinguishable from modern ANU-AMS 775 UDM/3  1 indistinguishable from modern ANU-AMS 776 UDM/4  2 indistinguishable from modern These age determinations are inconclusive as to the age of the motifs, and suggest problems with  the field sampling procedure (McDonald 2000c).  The three dates which are indistinguishable from modern standard suggest that there has  been contamination of both motifs by younger material (lichens or other microscopic organics).  Conversely this art was produced either just prior to European contact or up until 1950 AD.  This latter scenario would seem unlikely for motif #2 which is faded and partially affected by  surface exfoliation (Figure 8.11). Motif #1 was produced using a lump of charcoal and comprises  a single line outline. The samples were collected from locations where it was clear that only one  stroke had been executed. This makes it unlikely, in archaeological terms, that this motif has been  contaminated by a more recent ‘touching up’ of the motif.  The date c.500 BP may be an accurate representation of the age of motif #1. Conversely,  given that the two contaminated dates from this same motif, it could indeed be older. If the  contamination is contemporary (i.e. micro-organics still alive at the time of sample collection),  then  the date returned may be significantly younger  than  it should be. John Head (Quaternary  Dating Research Centre, pers. comm., 1994) suggested that the 500 year old date may indeed be  double that - c.1,000 years BP.  Resolution of this problem will only be achieved through further  fieldwork which aims  to  identify sources of  local contamination on  the surface of  the  rock or  growing on the art.  terra australis 27 181 </page> <page sequence="12"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange Figure 8.11: Panel 3 showing context of incised panel and the macropod #2 in the alcove  (arrowed right) which was sampled for AMS dating.  figure 8.12: udm Shelter. macropod  motif #1 from which three AMS  samples were collected. terra australis 27 182 </page> <page sequence="13"> Chapter 8: Excavations at Upside-Down-Man   These contradictory results make it difficult to make firm conclusions about the production  date of the outlined charcoal macropod. On face value, it would appear that art was being produced  at this site up until c.500 BP: after other occupation of the shelter had ceased. The fact that  contamination cannot be ruled out means that this motif may have been produced in the final or  even terminal phase of the site’s occupation.  The excavation Aims The aims of the excavation were to determine;  1)  the nature and timing of the occupation evidence at the site; Of particular interest was whether this evidence indicated domestic use of the shelter. Only one  site with a larger art assemblage had previously been excavated in the Mangrove Creek Valley  (MacIntosh 1965). None of Attenbrow’s 31 occupation sites had major art assemblages. It was  thus of interest to characterise the occupation debris at UDM.  2)  Whether there were two or more phases of occupation evidence at the site (as  suggested by the art);  and, 3)  Whether the art was contemporaneous with the occupation deposit.  All three aims have been achieved by this work, the last inconclusively.  Methods Conventional  archaeological  techniques  were  employed  in  this  test  excavation  (Figure  8.2).  Squares were located based on two criteria:  1)   the presence of a relatively flat, protected floor area in relatively close proximity to    pigment art panels; and,  2)  the likelihood of a reasonable depth of deposit.  The sloping back wall of the shelter suggested that much of the deposit at the site would be  shallow. Probing with metal skewers indicated that most of the deposit close to the back wall is  &lt;20cm deep. Excavating in immediate proximity to decorated panels (cf. Rosenfeld et al. 1981,  Morwood 1992b) was not an option here.  A 50cm x 50cm pit (6B) and two 50cm x 100cm trenches (Squares 4 and 8) were excavated.  A total of 1.25m2 was  investigated: a 2.8% sample of  the floor area with  reasonable depth of  deposit.  Excavation in all squares was by 5cm spits or in stratigraphic units, whichever were smaller  (Figure 8.13). The two 50cm x 100cm trenches were excavated as two consecutive 50 x 50cm  pits. Large and/or diagnostic artefacts and charcoal samples were provenanced during excavation.  The small size of the excavation units was felt to be sufficient for the purposes of provenancing  excavated material.  All deposit was dry-sieved through 5mm and 2.5mm sieves on site. Unsorted residue from  the 2.5mm sieve was bagged and retained for later sorting. This has been preliminarily sorted but  is retained as a category of cultural material. The residue consists mainly of charcoal, fine gravel,  terra australis 27 183 </page> <page sequence="14"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange vegetation (leaves and small twigs in the upper most layers, root material lower down) and micro- debitage, although the latter was specifically targeted during sorting.  Stratigraphy The  excavations  revealed  four  stratigraphic  layers  (Figure  8.16,  Figure  8.17).  These  were  identified on the basis of soil colour and texture (Figure 8.14, Figure 8.15). An ashy lens occurred  in all squares between layers 1 and 2 (at varying depths). Each of these was considered to be  a  specific and  separate hearth,  and  so  these not given Layer  status. This  ashy  lens  is  the best  indicator of where recent scuffage stops and in situ deposit starts. This is generally quite close  to the surface (see section drawings). The sandy deposit was extremely compact. The identified  Layers were clearly defined on the basis of colour and textural variation. While there may have  been some downward movement of smaller artefactual material, the stratigraphic integrity of the  site is good.  The Layers identified were; I Surface leaf litter, loose grey sandy deposit with high organic/humic and charcoal content.  Some recent materials e.g. cigarette filter (Colour 10YR 3/3; pH = 9). II More consolidated than Layer I, brown grey, sandy deposit. Reddish brown in square 4  (5YR 5/4, pH = 6.5); more orange brown (Colour 10YR 5/3; pH = 6.5) in Squares 6 and  8.  III Yellow brown, sandy deposit with low charcoal content. There are again slight colour  differences between square 4 and Squares 6 and 8, with the latter being somewhat pinker  (Colour 7.5 YR 6/6; pH = 3.5) than found in square 4 (Colour 7.5YR 6/4; pH = 3.5). IV Yellow/pink white (Colour 7.5YR 7/4; pH = 4.5) sandy deposit with very low charcoal  content. Many small roots. N.B While there is a general increase in acidity with depth,  layer III is more acidic than layer IV.  In Square 4 (Figure 8.16):   Layer II - was quite orange with a red area (Colour 10YR 5/6) at the eastern end of the  pit. This was apparently associated with the burning event/ashy lens (very low quantity of  charcoal and bone were observed, suggesting an extremely hot fire oxidising the surrounding  deposit).  Layer III - yellow brown sandy deposit in contact with bedrock: immediately adjacent to  bedrock there is a darker band (&lt;1cm thick) of deposit. The following specific notes were made regarding Square 6 (Figure 8.16):  Layer I - Ashy lens here is associated with two separate hearths with ashy lenses above the  charcoal rich features. One of these is in the southern corner, the other along the northern  baulk.   Layer II - extends down to bedrock in southern corner in this square, beneath the intact  hearth. This suggests prehistoric disturbance (pit? some other sort of excavation?), which  has disrupted the units below. Several largish pieces of sandstone roof-fall were found here  and above intact Layer III in eastern corner. terra australis 27 184 </page> <page sequence="15"> Chapter 8: Excavations at Upside-Down-Man figure 8.13: udm Shelter. excavated spits – all squares.  Layers III and IV - thicker at western side of pit (deeper owing to sloping bedrock). In Square 8, the following notes were made (Figure 8.17):  Layer I - deeper at the western end of pit (square 8b) and thinner at eastern end (square 8c).  Ashy lens found at both ends of pit but not in centre.  Layer II - found only at eastern and western ends of pit on the northern side of the square,  but present along entire length by southern side of pit. This Layer is quite deep at the  western end of the square.  Layer III - quite pink in this square.

This was straightforward since the  shelter floor was flat and adjacent squares were dug simultaneously (Table 8.6; Figure 8.13).  Dates Four charcoal samples were submitted to the ANU Quaternary Dating Research Centre. These  have been counted and the following age determinations obtained (Table 8.7).

While each square’s dates are internally  coherent, there is a reversal in the expected outcome for layers II and III.  The presence of the  large  tree  root  in  square 8B may have  affected  the  integrity of  this  square,  although  the field  notes accompanying sample 8B/5/1 suggest that this was not obvious in the field. The field notes  do indicate that there were a number of smaller roots though this spit; hence it is possible then  that this age determination has been contaminated by younger carbon. This was, however, a  provenanced sample while sample ANU-8135 was collected from the sieves. The in situ sample  is considered to be the more reliable of the two.

Bone was also present in very small quantities (50.7g) in the upper layers.  Most of this is highly fragmented. With the exception of several macropod and small marsupial  teeth, rib fragments and a few reptile vertebrae, most is unidentifiable. The bone fragments were  found in several conditions: burnt, calcined, weathered and/or stained and fresh. While some of  the fresh bone, particularly of smaller species, may represent recent additions, the majority is  considered to be culturally derived.  Plant Remains and Pigment Amongst the cultural remains, in minute quantities, are seeds, white pipeclay and red ochre.  The seeds were analysed by the Seeds Laboratory (NSW Department of Agriculture). These  included:   Geebung (Persoonia spp.) 2 seeds;    Native cherry (Exocarpus cipressiformis) 1 seed each in 4C/1 (gnawed) and 4D/1  (cracked);    Vine lilac or false sarsaparilla (Hardenbergia violace) in 4C/1, 1 seed; in 8B/3, 4  seeds;   and,    Senna (Cassia spp.) - in 4C/1, 1 seed; 6B/5, 1 seed. There are also 20 seeds in 8B/3 and two desiccated fleshy pieces which could not be identified.  Under a microscope, the interior of these seeds (somewhat like Callitris seeds) has a honeycombed  appearance, more in keeping with bony structure.   Pigment was found only in isolated spits (pipeclay in 6B/3 and 8B/2, red ochre in 4C/3  and 4D/1). The pipeclay (four fragments in 6B/3; one fragment in 8B/2) is highly weathered  and, possibly as a result of this poor condition (and small size), shows no traces of use. The two  fragments of red ochre in 4C/1 are of a fine texture and produce a dark red colour (Munsell 5R  3/6) on white paper. These two fragments are extremely small (0.1g). Neither shows striations or  other evidence of usewear. This may result from their very small size. The one small fragment  (0.2g) of dark red ochre in 4C/3 is very granular and of poor quality. Change over time The site’s cultural deposit demonstrates obvious changes over time in its composition. In the  lower two levels, stone artefacts make up the bulk of the cultural material present. In the upper  layers there is significantly more charcoal and a higher proportion of finer residue. Shell and bone  are only found in the top two strata (Figure 8.18).  Many of these patterns, particularly those involving the site’s organic remains, may be due  to unequal preservation: the lower layers are very acidic. This is consistent with the environment  usually provided by Hawkesbury sandstone but also reflects an absence of neutralising components  in the older depositional period (i.e. ash, shell) which provided a more alkaline (neutralising)  environment (see McDonald 1992a).  terra australis 27 189 </page> <page sequence="20"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange %f 0 20 40 60 80 100 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Square 6B Lithics Shell/Bone %f Charcoal 0 20 40 60 80 100 Unsorted Residue 1 Other 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 figure 8.18: udm. cultural  Square 8B components in the three  analysed squares. change over  0 20 40 %f 60 80 100 time. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Square 8C Artefact Analysis When  this  site was first  recorded  by Patricia Vinnicombe  in  1978,  a  bifacially flaked  hatchet  preform  (Figure  8.19) was  found  in  the  vegetation  at  the  front  of  the  shelter.  Four  pieces  of  fragmented shell (Anadara sp. and Hyridella sp.) and 25 knapped stone artefacts were collected  from the dripline (and lodged in the Australian Museum). These artefacts were made of a range  of raw materials, silcrete, silicified tuff, quartzite, fine-grained basic (FGB), quartz. Three of the  FGB pieces amongst this collection had evidence of previously ground facets, and there was one  broken silcrete backed blade. Also found was one piece of thick black/green glass, although this  does not appear to have been worked. Many more artefacts were observed in the dripline during  the current fieldwork, but these were not collected or recorded.    A total of 3,550 artefacts were retrieved from the five test pits at the site. Only three of the  pits (6B, 8B and 8C), with 3,290 artefacts, were analysed in detail.   The artefact material from the three analysed squares is dealt with collectively and then  detailed according to each square, separately and in combination, for the analyses of vertical  distribution.  terra australis 27 190 Analytical Units Analytical Units Analytical Units </page> <page sequence="21"> Chapter 8: Excavations at Upside-Down-Man figure 8.19: The bifacially  flaked basalt axe pre-form  collected by pat vinnicombe  in 1978. pitting on one face  suggests that this may have  also been used as an anvil. Raw Material Quartz is the predominant raw material found at UDM (38%), followed by Silicified Tuff (21%),  fine  grained  basic  (19%)  and  veined  pebble  chert  (15%).  The  remaining  raw  material  types  (silcrete, chert, quartzite and ‘other’) were present in very small numbers. The general proportions  are mirrored in the individual squares (Figure 8.20), although there is more FGB in square 6B and  a larger proportion of silicified tuff in Squares 8B and 8C.    When  only  artefacts  &gt;1cm  are  considered  (Figure  8.21)  the  overall  pattern  is  similar,  although there is proportionally more veined chert in square 8B, more quartz in 8C and an equal  dominance of quartz and FGB  in  square 6B. These patterns can be partially explained by  the  presence of discrete knapping events in various locations across the site, and partially by temporal  variability (see below 5.3.4.ii).  Some interesting patterns are observable when the raw material preferences for utilised  artefacts are considered. Most of the artefacts with R/U (retouch and/or usewear) are made of  silicified  tuff  (31.8%)  or  chert  (22.7%), with  veined  chert  being  the  next most  used material  (13.6%). While  these figures show a consistency in preference (i.e. compared with  the overall  assemblage figures) for silicified tuff and veined chert, chert figures much more highly amongst  terra australis 27 191 </page> <page sequence="22"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange the R/U than it does in the assemblage generally. Over 17% of the chert artefacts (&gt;1cm) have  evidence for retouch and/or usewear (Table 8.9) significantly more than the percentage frequency  for any other raw material. The fact that there are no cores made of this raw material suggests  either that this was a valued raw material, artefacts of which were transported around the landscape  in finished form; or perhaps that valued cores of this material were subsequently removed from  the site for continued use elsewhere. Some knapping of this material obviously occurred at UDM;  although some of this micro-debitage may have been produced by the usage of several of the chert  artefacts (e.g. the tool from 6B/3 has extensive and heavy R/U and some notching). Many (60%)  of the R/U chert artefacts are of translucent chert, more common in the Hunter Valley than the  Sydney sandstone.  Size The majority (71.7%) of the artefacts in the assemblage are &lt;1cm long while most of the remainder  (26.8%) are between 1-3cm long (Table 8.10). Relatively few artefacts (1.1%) are between 3-5cm,  and two only (0.1%) are larger than 5cm24.  Artefact Types The majority (98.2%) of the artefacts at the site consists of unmodified debitage (Table 8.10). The  remainder include 37 cores (1.1%) and 22 artefacts with retouch and/or usewear (R/U - 0.7%).  Of this latter type, eight are backed artefacts. Seven (87.5%) of these are Bondi (i.e. asymmetric)  points, while the other is a trapezoidal geometric. Also present amongst the assemblage are  numerous flakes (63) with residual evidence of edge-grinding in the form of smooth faceted planes  with striations. These artefacts indicate that several edged-ground implements have been broken  up at UDM. None of these artefacts shows any sign of further utilisation and thus, while indicative  of grinding as a technological component, they are not, strictly speaking, utilised artefacts. While  included in the artefact type discussions, they have been excluded from some calculations of  artefact type proportions.  Almost half (43%) of the material with evidence of grinding is micro-debitage (&lt;1cm in  size): two pieces only are in the 3-5cm range. From the colour ranges in this raw material it would  appear that three edge-ground implements were knapped in the vicinity of Squares 6 and 8. None  of this material has evidence for further retouch/usewear and these implements appear to have  being broken up for some reason other  than  the production of useable flakes: possibly  further  flaking prior to additional grinding?  Of the eight backed artefacts at the site, four are incomplete. Two are butt ends probably  broken during manufacture. The other two are the distal tips of backed blades, one of which has  R/U on the chord. These may have broken during use: two of the eight have fine flaking along  their chords, indicating some sort of use. The geometric backed blade has macroscopic residue,  suggesting this artefact may have been hafted. There is no evidence for usewear or damage to the  chord or point of this artefact.    There is an increase over time in the density of artefactual material deposited (Figure 8.22).  This has been calculated on the basis of artefacts per kilogram of excavated deposit.  Vertical Distribution Clear stratigraphic divisions in the deposit were observed in the field. Analysis of the excavated  assemblage indicates that some of these differences are cultural and that there is change over time  in the nature of the artefactual material deposited.   24At the time that this analysis was undertaken (1991) the artefact size was usually measured in these size categories.

Changes in artefact density seem to indicate that there were two main phases of occupation at the  site, with peaks in these depositional periods coinciding first with unit IV and then later with unit  II. The earlier period is characterised by a sparse artefact density; the later period was much more  intensive. The occupation represented by Unit III indicates either a hiatus in shelter use, or at least  a very low level of occupation. Interpretation of this occupation can be refined by more detailed  artefact analyses. terra australis 27 193 </page> <page sequence="24"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange  25  20  Square 6B  %f 15  10  5  0  Key: Raw Materials  rtz  30 quasilcrete  25 silicified tuff Square 8B figure 8.20: udm. raw material FGB  20 quartzite proportions in the three analysed  %f 15 veined chert  chert squares.

Raw Material There are definite changes in raw material preferences over time. While there are differences in  sample size between the earlier and the later assemblages, the sample sizes in the earlier units  are sufficiently large (i.e. &gt;100 artefacts per stratigraphic unit) to make meaningful comparisons.  Given the biases inherent in smaller sample sizes, a correlation between sample sizes and raw  material ranges was sought (Figure 8.24). There is no direct positive correlation between sample  size and the range of raw material present – so sample size will not affect the interpretation  of these results (James 1993). The data below are based on calculations for both total artefact  numbers (Figure 8.25) and artefacts &gt;1cm (Figure 8.26).  terra australis 27 196 </page> <page sequence="27"> Chapter 8: Excavations at Upside-Down-Man figure 8.25: udm Shelter.  Vertical distribution (%f) of  raw material. All artefacts. In  the  earlier  period  of  occupation,  silicified  tuff  predominates  and  there  is  a more  restricted  range of raw materials generally. In the later period of occupation quartz gradually increases in  use, while silicified tuff declines. There is a proliferation in the range of raw material being used.  Some of these are not found at all in the earliest phase of occupation. The relationship between  quartz and silicified tuff (Figure 8.27)  is contrary  to  the divergent pattern which would be  the  expected result if sample size were responsible for raw material proportions (James 1993).    FGB material  is  notably  absent  from  the  earlier  layers  of  deposit. While  some micro- debitage of this material occurs in square 8C, it is virtually absent from the earliest layers. Based  on this evidence, the earlier phase is presumed to predate edge grinding as a technique. Sample  sizes in Layers III and IV are comparable, justifying this conclusion. This evidence, supported  by the dates received, suggests that the earlier occupation is Early Bondaian or older (Attenbrow  2004).  terra australis 27 197 </page> <page sequence="28"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange figure 8.26:    udm Shelter.  vertical distribution  (%f) of raw material per  analytical unit.

The artefact in Layer II consists of a  porphyry (BP) flake, the only piece of this material at the site. The large artefact in Layer III is an  FGB flake (with a broad platform and platform preparation). Both of these larger artefacts were  found in square 8C.

Micro-debitage may  well indicate intensity of knapping activity. It has also been suggested (Hiscock 1986) that raw  material and knapping technique may contribute to the amount of shatter in an assemblage, and  that the change to bipolar technique is heralded by the very high proportion of small material in  the later phases of the Eastern Regional Sequence. At UDM both bipolar quartz and indurated  mudstone (knapped used a hand held technique) reveal a similar pattern in artefact size reduction  between the earlier and later phases at the Upside-Down-Man Shelter. This tends to support the  hypothesis of a greater degree of knapping per se in the upper levels.  terra australis 27 199 </page> <page sequence="30"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange Table 8.17: udm Shelter. raw material per analytical unit.

Four  types of platforms were  distinguished  on  the  flakes;  broad  (‘B’),  broad  with  evidence  for  platform  preparation  (i.e.  platform remnant on dorsal surface; several scars on platforms - ‘BP’), focalised (‘F’) and bipolar  (‘Bip’). Two types of flaked pieces were identified; amorphous (‘Am’) and lamellate (‘Lamm’)  (see McDonald 1994: Appendix A3.1 for raw data; Appendix 8 for glossary of terms used).  The proportions and the changes in the proportions of these characteristics were investigated  (Table 8.17; Figure 8.28). Detailed technological analysis was not undertaken, but the approach  was based on the findings of the (then) recent work of Baker (1992), following Hiscock’s (1986)  approach to technological change during the Holocene. Baker’s work had refined Hiscock’s earlier  model and determined that certain flake characteristics are sensitive indicators of technological  strategies and change over time. He demonstrated that:  the Sandy Hollow pre-Bondaian level SH1/5 is characterised by core rotation, a lack of  platform preparation and ... low platform angles ... By contrast Phase I levels SH1/3 and  SH1/4 are characterised by platform preparation and high platform angles typical of a blade  based technology. Phase II levels SH1/1 and SH1/2 are characterised by focalised platforms  which represent continued attempts to remove thin flakes or, more probably, blades from  the core. (Baker 1992: 84)   Baker’s analysis validated Hiscock’s analytical approach at the Sandy Hollow site. However,  he  encountered difficulties using  the  approach  to  test  for  chronological  phases  in  the Narama  open site assemblages from the central Hunter lowlands (Rich 1992). There was no consistent  association between any of the Sandy Hollow levels and the Narama assemblages, which, from  their  associations with  backed  artefacts  and  other  flake  and  core  characteristics, were  clearly  Bondaian in age (Baker 1992:84). Baker’s analysis indicated that an abbreviated set of variables  may as effectively allow different technological phases to be differentiated. The current analysis  was attempted on the basis of that finding.  At UDM, focalised platforms are the most common form (43.6%), followed by bipolar  flakes  (30.9%)  and  broad  platforms  (23.1%).  Platform  preparation  is  relatively  rare  and  was  observable on only 10 flakes (2.4%). Lamellate flaked pieces (56.5%) are slightly more common  than amorphous flaked pieces (43.5%: Figure 8.28).    The most  consistent  indicator of  change over  time  is flake platform shape. The general  pattern is one of a decrease over time in broad platformed flakes, with a concomitant increase in  bipolar flakes. Focalised platforms are present  in roughly the same proportions throughout  the  sequence although percentage figures for this platform type are consistently highest in the upper  terra australis 27 200 </page> <page sequence="31"> Chapter 8: Excavations at Upside-Down-Man layers (Table 8.18).

Cores The 37 cores were analysed, with multiplatformed (‘M’), single platformed (‘S’) and bipolar  (‘B’) types being distinguished. The general proportions and changes in these characteristics were  investigated and the results plotted (Figure 8.28).   Only bipolar (86.5%) and multiplatformed cores were found. The fact that no single- platformed cores were observed possibly reflects a conservation of raw materials by the knappers  at the site: i.e. cores were used until exhausted, or at least more than once.  The sample size for cores is relatively small for considering temporal change at the site.  However, with the exception of one bipolar core found in spit 8B/7, all the cores in the lower  levels  are multiplatformed while  all  those  in  the  upper  layers  are  bipolar  (Figure  8.28). This  pattern reflects the trend observed in the debitage for an increase in dominance over time in the  bipolar flaking of (particularly) quartz.   Using the mosaic of platform characteristics over time, the assemblage is best interpreted  as demonstrating two phases of knapping over time.  1.  The  earliest  phase  is  characterised  by  the  presence  of  mainly  broad-platformed  flakes  although focal platforms are used; platform preparation and bipolar techniques are rare.   2 The subsequent phase shows a sharp increase in platform preparation and an increase in focal  platforms. The bipolar technique becomes increasingly important. This phase represents  the most intensive occupation (in which the highest discard rate occurred). Broad platforms  occur in much smaller proportions. No platform preparation is in evidence. In the terminal  phase of site occupation a decreased artefact frequency (and sample size) results in fewer  bipolar pieces and an increase in focal platforms.  Backed Artefacts Eight backed artefacts were found at the site. There are no raw material preference trends over the  short period of their use (Figure 8.30). These were only found in the top five units: in Layers I, II  and the top of unit III (Figure 8.29). The presence of this artefact type coincides with the period  of maximum artefact density (and larger sample sizes), and the increase in quartz and the bipolar  technique. Flakes with focalised platforms also predominate here, as expected with a technology  geared to the production of backed artefacts.  terra australis 27 201 </page> <page sequence="32"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange %f  The presence of this tool type postdates  0 20 40 60 80 100 the introduction of focalised platforms  1 2 and flakes with platform preparation.

While the sample is extremely small, the trend  indicated by the retouched material is similar to the general pattern found in the whole assemblage  (Figure 8.29); i.e. a change over time from broad platform in the earlier deposit, to focal platforms  and bipolar technique in the later deposit.    As  with  artefact  density  (Figure  8.22)  and  platform  shapes  (Figure  8.28)  the  vertical  distribution of the artefacts with macroscopic R/U suggests two phases of site occupation. There  are two peaks in the use of artefacts (Figure 8.29). The very low number of artefacts with R/U in  Layer III suggests that this period represents some sort of hiatus in site usage, rather than a period  terra australis 27 202 Analytical Unit Analytical Unit Analytical Unit </page> <page sequence="33"> Chapter 8: Excavations at Upside-Down-Man of very low density occupation. Again, low accumulation rates and smaller sample size in the  lower units makes this interpretation difficult. Grinding As well as the ground edged hatchet collected in the dripline and the many grinding grooves  located outside the sandstone shelter, grinding activity is documented by the presence of 63  fragments with ground facets in the deposit. They are all unmodified debitage and the distinctive  colour ranges indicate that at least three edge-ground implements were broken up at the site. The  three colours are black, blue-grey and brown-grey. While the blue-grey is found in both pits, black  occurs only in square 6B, but the brown-grey is restricted to square 8 (Table 8.20). Only a small  proportion of the blue-grey occurs in square 8, and it would appear that the focus for the knapping  of the first two colours was in square 6B.  The vertical distribution of this material includes Layers I-III (Table 8.20), with the main  concentration in the upper layers of Layer II (Figure 8.29).
