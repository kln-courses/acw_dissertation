<plain_text><page sequence="1">Letters BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION Arnold B. Grobman is quite correct in citing the importance of science education and in calling for a coordinated effort to improve science education in our schools (October 1984 Bioscience 34: 551-557). The complex problems that confront the world today require a corps of highly trained profes- sionals and a scientifically competent public. I object, however, when this issue is framed in terms of economic or military competition between the United States and other nations. We need not haul out the specters of a declin- ing standard of living, a faltering economy, and military impotence to argue very persua- sively in favor of heightened support for sci- ence education. It is true that "we do not, most unfortunate- ly, live in a world where peaceful coexistence is assured" (p. 556). However, the well-being of life on earth will not be furthered through additional efforts to stock this nation's de- fense industry with scientists prepared to de- sign a new generation of weapons. The politi- cal, social, and environmental problems that face humankind are global in nature and will only be solved through international cooper- ation. As an influential member of the interna- tional community, the United States has a special obligation to direct its vast resources toward the peaceful solution of these prob- lems. It is only through a strong program of science education that the citizens of this country will be able to make the hard deci- sions that must be made in the coming years. This, I believe, is a more appropriate argu- ment for a renewed dedication to science education. STEVE FIFIELD Department of Ecology and Behavioral Biology University of Minnesota Minneapolis, MN 55455 STRATEGY: MISUSE OR INSIGHT? When teaching introductory biology at the undergraduate level, we try to be sure our students understand a number of messages. Two of the most important are simple and straightforward. First, we remind them that biology, like all disciplines, has a language of its own and that the vocabulary of that lan- guage must be mastered if the subject itself is to be mastered. Second, we stress that there is no substitute for clear and critical reason- ing. Paul Kramer, who criticizes the use of the term strategy in the ecological literature (July/ August 1984 BioScience 34: 405), seems to have forgotten these two lessons. Kramer presents three related attacks on this term: the concept of a strategy is both teleological and anthropomorphic because, given the dic- tionary definition of strategy, foresight and planning in anticipation of future events is a cornerstone of a successful strategy; use of the term results in careless thinking and writ- ing; and its occurrence is misleading to non- scientists. We would like to make a brief rebuttal to each of these points and then advocate the continued use of this convenient term. The definition offered in a nontechnical dictionary, regardless of its quality, should be of little concern to research or teaching biolo- gists. The vocabulary of all scientific disci- plines is replete with terms that have technical and nontechnical meanings (e.g., niche, guild, and fitness in evolutionary biology). The word selection, for example, used in an evolution- ary context, does not imply any conscious choice on the part of the agents of natural selection. It is thus unreasonable to measure the scientific merit of a term using Webster's yardstick. The correct question to ask in the present situation is: Does continued use of the term strategy provide any insight for evolu- tionary biologists? As biologists who research and teach about strategies in both animals and plants, our answer is a resounding yes. Use of the term strategy and the concepts it embodies is valuable to biologists, for it re- minds us of the dichotomy between proximate and ultimate causation. Kramer uses the re- sponses of plants to water stress to illustrate a situation where he finds the strategy concept irrelevant and misleading. But Kramer ap- pears to be focusing entirely on short-term, proximate effects. Such proximate responses of plants to water stress include changes in leaf size and anatomy and changes in root/ shoot ratio. These changes might decrease the probability of death during a drought, thereby increasing the fitness of phenotypes able to respond appropriately to moisture stress. The ultimate response of a plant population to repeated drought might, therefore, be evolu- tion of a set of water stress-tolerating charac- teristics, i.e., a strategy. To reject this term effectively confines us to the study of proximate responses, with little concern for the integrated activities of the whole organism or for the coevolution of adaptive characteristics. Strategy, when used correctly, implies nothing about planning or foresight but rather describes the long-term evolution of a particular phenotype. When misused, the term surely might become a haven for sloppy thinking and writing. It would probably be incorrect, for example, to assume that every phenotypic trait was im- portant enough for natural selection to oper- ate on it directly. The possibility of misuse, however, should not discourage biologists from continuing to use this term. When placed in its proper biological context, strategy should not be considered either teleological or anthropo- morphic by any evolutionary biologist. Kra- mer is quite correct when he says that this term may be misunderstood by nonscientists. We suspect, however, that most of the techni- cal literature in all disciplines would not be fully appreciated by nonspecialists. The point to keep in mind is that an author must always be aware of his/her audience. When writing for a general readership, great care must be taken to ensure that terms are defined in a way that reduces the possibility of confusion from overlapping vocabularies. While creat- ing jargon should always be avoided, coining terms for important concepts furthers scien- tific progress by improving communication and encapsulating complex ideas simply and conveniently. MICHAEL ZIMMERMAN DAVID J. HICKS Department of Biology Oberlin College Oberlin, OH 44074 NUTRIENT SOLUTIONS Emanuel Epstein indicates that "rhizo- stats" will usher in a new era of research in mineral plant nutrition (November 1984 Bio- Science 34: 605). Could it be comparable to the era when conventional nutrient solutions were first introduced and have since been BioScience Vol. 35 No. 2 66</page><page sequence="2">modified? Let's hope it will accomplish what Epstein suggests. I cannot agree with Epstein's evaluation of the conventional nutrient solutions now in use with their modifications. All nutrient solu- tions do not contain 14 mM nitrate, 6 mM potassium, and 2 mM phosphate. We have examined nutritional problems in soils such as iron deficiency, boron deficiency and boron toxicity, manganese toxicity, and aluminum toxicity in plants. We have been able to select nutrient-efficient, nutrient-inef- ficient, nutrient-tolerant, and nutrient-intoler- ant genotypes using nutrient solutions and confirm our results by growing the plants in specific soils where the problems exist. Drifts in solution pH are welcomed because they are one indicator that the plant is possibly adapt- ing to a mineral stress or use of a particular element. For example, iron-deficiency stress in some plants causes metabolic changes with the release of hydrogen ions, release of a reductant (reduces Fe3+ to Fe2+), which in- creases reduction of ferric to ferrous iron at the root, and the accumulation of citrate in the root, which chelates iron and transports it to plant tops. The process is genetically controlled. Iron-deficiency stress can be caused more ways than by omitting the element or letting it become depleted. While maintaining the pH above 6 with added sodium bicarbonate, cal- cium carbonate, with only nitrate nitrogen as the nitrogen source and varied concentrations of phosphate, copper, manganese and zinc, can cause iron-deficiency stress by changing plants' metabolism and making iron available to them. The iron-inefficient plant does not respond to the iron stress, becomes chlorotic, and dies from lack of iron. All plant genotypes do not respond alike or to the same degree to a specific nutrient stress. One of the greatest challenges to biolo- gists today is to understand or give a role to the organism as it relates to efficient use of or tolerance to mineral elements. JOHN C. BROWN USDA, Plant Stress Laboratory Beltsville, MD 20705 ANOTHER SOLUTION In their article, "Faunal Commercialization and Conservation in South America" (Octo- ber 1984 BioScience 34: 580-584), Michael A. Mares and Ricardo A. Ojeda give data on the commercial use of wildlife in Argentina. Ex- cept for the commercial use of introduced species, opossums, and skunks, they imply that the commercial take is excessive, but they present no data to establish this fact. In many instances they are probably correct, however. They state, "We do not believe that the current widespread ignorance of conservation problems in Latin America will be eliminated by short-term solutions." They go on to advo- cate, especially, US training of Latin Ameri- can biologists who will return to work in their home countries throughout their lives. Al- though I applaud this approach, I must point out that women biologists from Latin America (one of whom is now working with me) should be given more consideration than indicated by their final sentence: "His species are disap- pearing and his forests are being felled-his actions will make the difference." The em- phasis is the authors', not mine. Training Latin American biologists in North American and European universities is an excellent approach toward the long-term solutions of conservation problems in Latin America. Judging by our many and continuing conservation failures at home, however, I doubt that it will be a panacea, although it certainly will help. But there is another solution that can also help, although it is certainly no panacea. That is to make the politically powerful individuals in Argentina and elsewhere aware of the con- siderable value of wildlife and that it requires husbandry in order to maintain its value to the nation. Mares and Ojeda unintentionally make a very strong argument for such awareness in their article. For example, they say, "Assum- ing they are sold to wholesale buyers at two to four times the declared port value, mammal skins and leather alone would yield an income of $225 million a year." "The importance of an Argentine industry with a large income in hard currency cannot be overstated." "Few products are so readily convertible into hard currency, particularly since no sophisticated techniques or equipment are required for processing." "Wildlife products are an ideal means for converting weak pesos into strong francs, pounds, or dollars." We now know something about how hu- mans respond to different types of laws con- cerning ownership and use of wildlife. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) is ca- pable and willing to provide expertise in such matters. From what Mares and Ojeda say and the data they present, it sounds as though Argentina is ripe for assistance toward game ranching. Game ranching is a legitimate and rationally controlled way to safely use wildlife and, through that, preserve their habitats, thus saving the "geese that lay the golden eggs." For those that worry about commercializa- tion leading to extinction, consider the depth of worldwide concern over the extinction of commercialized domestic cattle. Since these living cattle are owned, they are in quite a different conservation situation from most na- tive wildlife species in the United States and in many other countries. Live wildlife are more secure when they are owned, and their ownership and values legally recognized. There will still be poachers, just as there are still cattle rustlers, but there is also law en- forcement to protect owned property so that the rustler and the poacher may well be tried for the same crime in the eyes of the law. The institution of laws that allow rational game ranching does not require highly trained biologists, nor does their enforcement. Highly trained biologists will be needed, but the impetus will be a natural one stemming from recognized personal and national needs. What successful nation can afford to ignore the needs of its agriculturalists? Game ranching is much like cattle ranching except that wild animals rather than domestic ones are used. As Mares and Ojeda show, it is an industry so valuable that Argentina cannot afford to ig- nore it. Game ranching can help slow the loss of wildlife in Latin America and can start doing so as soon as favorable circumstances are created. This, as shown above, is an entirely different thing from enforcement of conserva- tion laws, which the authors say remains an elusive goal in South America where "real enforcement of wildlife legislation is probably decades away." This elusive goal is probably becoming more so as population and poverty increase. They expect a wave of species ex- tinction in the foreseeable future. Some things need doing in the near term to prevent that, and game ranching is quite possibly an impor- tant one of those things. ARCHIE S. MOSSMAN Department of Wildlife Humboldt State University Arcata, CA 95521 Authors' reply Professor Mossman's comments on our pa- per are much appreciated. Certainly game ranching is a feasible solution for a few spe- cies, but the majority of wildlife species do not lend themselves to domestication or even semidomestication. Thus, while there are sev- eral active programs underway on rhea, capy- bara, nutria, and even caiman farming, there are no skunk, opossum, or spotted cat farms of which I am aware. Unfortunately, it is probably much cheaper to pay a hunter occa- sional wages to kill wildlife than to pay a ranch-hand regular wages to raise game ani- mals. Moreover, the biology of most of these species is poorly known, at best, and tech- niques for semidomestication are not avail- able. While it is laudable to try to expand game farming efforts, a massive program of education of natural scientists is required to speed the development of a conservation eth- ic in South America. As far as the personal pronoun "his" is concerned, we used this in the all-inclusive sense, of course, like "man" in mankind. Perhaps, since we dealt with South America, we might consider the "his" as in Hispanic. MICHAEL A.
