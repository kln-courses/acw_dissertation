         <title>I</title>
         <p>The present essay owes its inspiration as much as its organization to a suggestion in a list of proposed topics for the Seventh International Conference on the State of Mark Twain Studies, “One Man, Many Legacies,” held at Elmira College in 2013. The topic—“Mark Twain's Style: A Paragraph, a Sentence, a Word”—provides me with a general outline, its parenthetical extension—“inviting close reading”—provides me with an approach or a method. I shall proceed from paragraph to sentence to word. I shall also heed the invitation to close reading, but turn to biographical and historical facts whenever such evidence is needed or useful. From paragraph to sentence to word: I prefer to treat the sequence in terms of a climactic arrangement, giving summary attention to the paragraph as the largest unit, dealing with the sentence in more detail, then focusing on the word as the smallest unit and exploring it in the full range of its meaning and the implications of its use.</p>
         <p>I propose to discuss the opening episode of the first installment of Mark Twain's “Old Times on the Mississippi” series, originally printed as four paragraphs in the <italic>Atlantic Monthly</italic> in its January 1875 number, then reprinted (with minor changes) as two paragraphs in Chapter 4 of <italic>Life on the Mississippi</italic> in 1883. The text is familiar to every reader and critic of Mark Twain. It is, to cite a recent source, “one of the great scenes of Life in the United States, at a time now long forgotten” (Rank). And while it is certainly true that its appeal derives from the fact that it describes an event from a colorful and exciting period in American history, many people will readily subscribe to the point that I am making for these paragraphs as the author's very best prose and narration ever, also from the point of view of their style.</p>

         <title>II</title>
         <p>The opening sentence strikes to the heart of the matter: “When I was a boy, there was but one permanent ambition among my comrades in our village on the west bank of the Mississippi River. That was, to be a steamboatman” (“Old Times on the Mississippi” 71). The text then goes on to list the lesser, transient rival ambitions, that of becoming a circus clown, that of traveling with a minstrel show, that of becoming a pirate. All involve specific compelling performances that, though entirely repetitive in nature, are bound to cast a strong spell on a spectator, on a boy in particular. And it is in this respect, too, that the first paragraph prepares for the second and has us perceive and read it as the description, not so much of a singular event or an individual experience, but of another performance, another ritual that in a predictable fashion controls, as it were, the behavior of both agents and audience: “Once a day a cheap, gaudy packet arrived upward from St. Louis, and another downward from Keokuk. Before these events had transpired, the day was glorious with expectancy; after they had transpired, the day was a dead and empty thing” (71). What follows is Mark Twain's description, given retrospectively, from the vantage point of his fortieth year, of the daily spectacle (or rather, a composite version of it) that illustrates this general statement. Set against the background of “the white town, drowsing in the sunshine of a summer's morning,” with “the streets empty, or pretty nearly so,” the steamboat's arrival causes a sudden activity, a general commotion, a universal scramble “to get aboard, and to get ashore” (72), until, a mere ten minutes later, the steamer is under way again and the sleepy town returns to its former lethargy.</p>

         <title>III</title>
         <p>Much of the quality of the text is directly bound up with the circumstances of its inception and its writing. In late October 1874 William Dean Howells had asked Mark Twain for a contribution for the January 1875 number of the <italic>Atlantic Monthly</italic> as a follow-up to “A True Story” as published in the November number. Mark Twain wrote back to say that he could not think of a suitable subject, then went out for a walk with the Reverend Joseph Twichell, and immediately afterwards wrote a second letter to Howells with the following words: “[…] I take back the remark that I can't write for the Jan. number. For Twichell &amp; I have had a long walk in the woods &amp; I got to telling him about old Mississippi days of steamboating glory &amp; grandeur as I saw them (during 5 years) <italic>from the pilot house</italic>. He said ‘What a virgin subject to hurl into a magazine!’ I hadn't thought of that before. Would you like a series of papers to run through 3 months or 6 or 9?—or about 4 months, say?” (<italic>Mark Twain–Howells Letters</italic> 1:34). The information is useful not only in defining the narrator's perspective as that of a forty-year-old person, well established as a writer and a citizen in the community of Hartford, Connecticut, looking back on the days of his childhood as spent in a small village by the Mississippi River, but also in reminding us that his is the perspective of an ex-pilot, of a man writing, as it were, from the towering height of a pilot house, a fact underscored (quite literally) in his correspondence with Howells.</p>
         <p>It is the author's choice of subject matter along with the implications of his particular perspective on such matter that results in what may be called the narrative equivalent of a genre painting, in that it describes a routine event in the lives of predominantly simple people with an eye on realistic detail and a touch of humor in the presentation of incident. The paintings of Dutch artists such as Pieter Bruegel the Elder (1525/30–1569) come to mind, and also the Mississippi scenes as painted by George Caleb Bingham (1811–1879). And it is the juxtaposition of utter repose and hectic activity in its exaggeration (on the one hand) as well as (on the other) that of the innocent view of the boy and the experienced view of the writer and of the ex-pilot, the “professional view” (as a running title has it in Chapter 9 of <italic>Life on the Mississippi</italic> [121]), that in their tension and interaction account for the singular quality and appeal of the author's style in these opening paragraphs. In terms of choice of words we find everyday terms (boat, wharf, levee) along with technical terminology (packet, texas deck, boiler deck, hurricane deck, port bow, gauge cock) as well as poetic phrases (“the fragrant town drunkard”; “a flag gallantly flying from the jack staff”; “the pent steam […] screaming through the gauge cocks”) and colloquial expressions (“the day […] a dead and empty thing”; “a sow and a litter of pigs […] doing a good business in watermelon rinds and seeds”). And in terms of syntax we find straightforward SVO sentences and long paratactic clauses (in one case running to about two hundred words), as well as superb dying-fall cadences: “the point above the town and the point below, bounding the river glimpse into a sort of sea, and withal a very still and brilliant and lonely one.” All of these instances provide abundant exemplification of the impact of uniquely blended points of view on the presentation of an intriguing routine performance. Not only does such blending give Mark Twain's prose here a much richer texture than that of <italic>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</italic>, of the novel that has been held up as the endpoint of a development in which (as John C. Gerber puts it) “the detached and sharply restricted point of view of the boy […] results in Twain's most brilliant stylistic achievement” (151). It also is the source of his humor, which proceeds from the basic incompatibility of the views of the child, the ex-pilot, and the adult writer and the resulting incongruity between their respective vocabularies. We are given the description of the arrival of the steamboat from the innocent perspective of the boy, tempered by the perspective of the ex-pilot boasting a unique training and experience, and again tempered by the perspective of the adult who has seen much of the world. To the pilot the steamboat is not a steamboat but a packet, and all decks are expertly named. Not only does he know, as any adult might, that the “great volumes of the blackest smoke” that are “rolling and tumbling out of the chimneys” are merely part of the performance that has been gotten up to impress the spectators. He also knows in what fashion that “grandeur” is “created,” as he puts it: namely, “with a bit of pitch-pine just before arriving at a town.” By calling it a “husbanded grandeur” the author hints at the manipulatory nature of the splendor (despite all its impressive greatness), yet at the same time the metaphor does not in the least denounce the procedure as specious, as bad. Rather, it adds a touch of humor. The sentence, in fact, would seem to epitomize the careful balance that Mark Twain manages to strike in the passage as a whole between the different views, each modifying the drawbacks and the excesses of the others.</p>

         <title>IV</title>
         <p>The sentence I want to focus on is central to the whole passage. Nonetheless it is easily detachable from its context since it does not partake of either the realism or the humor of the genre painting. And it is, moreover, one of the most quoted sentences from Mark Twain's writings altogether: “the great Mississippi, the majestic, the magnificent Mississippi, rolling its mile-wide tide along, shining in the sun.” Not really a complete sentence in terms of the rules of syntax, but part of a long paratactic structure, the careful arrangement of these words sets it off as a unit in itself and suggests that even as a sentence fragment it be considered a sentence and called thus throughout this essay. The use of commas and breaks in the flow of the words, the interplay of initial consonance and internal assonance, and the sequence of adjectives (with the increase of their syllable count supporting the increase of their semantic weightiness: from “great” to “majestic” to “magnificent”) help to produce a distinctive pattern and rhythm hard to ignore in any reading, silent or aloud. What the sentence actually says may well influence our perception of its tone pattern, but it appears that while in its tripartite structure there is perhaps some hint of an upbeat in the first part, and perhaps some slight diminuendo in the last part, the sentence as a whole seems sustained on an elevated level, and it suggests repose, tranquility, serenity. And while it is not actually a long sentence (a mere eighteen words), it appears much longer since in many of its syllables the vowels are long rather than short, and the pauses also add to the impression of length, or better still, of magnitude. All of these qualities reflect and support the specific semantic content of the text and its obvious function to establish the Mississippi as the central object in, and as the moving force behind, all events as described in the passage as a whole (and eventually in all of the <italic>Atlantic Monthly</italic> contributions). A closer look reveals that sound and rhythm take precedence in the construction of this sentence over actual description and the constitution of meaning. This is evident in the choice and the use of adjectives. Those of the initial series (“great,” “majestic,” “magnificent”), while they do support the suggestion of magnitude, do not actually describe the Mississippi in its physical characteristics. And just as there is nothing very precise about these three adjectives in terms of their descriptive quality, the same can be said about “mile-wide,” which is used to specify the tide, or actually the width, of the river. The Mississippi, at the point of the actual setting (in Hannibal, Missouri) and for most of its long run, is definitely less than a mile wide, and while it is close to a mile in some stretches, it hardly ever exceeds that width—even though (in Chapter 19 of his <italic>Adventures</italic>) Huckleberry Finn does talk about “a monstrous big river down there—sometimes a mile and a half wide” (156). But “mile-wide” is a resonant and poetic term, of immediate and universal appeal, it seems.<sup>1</sup> So while “mile-wide” recommends itself through its poetic potential, as it were, the noun “tide,” though again technically an imprecise or even inadequate word (since the Mississippi has no “tides”), is a fine metaphor for a body of water to use along with it. “Mile-wide tide” in Mark Twain's sentence, thus, turns out to be an altogether natural and pleasing homophonic collocation of words, and as such it presents the visual impact of the mighty river on the spectator's sensibility rather than an accurate and reliable description to serve for technical purposes. In deliberately avoiding the professional view, the author draws on components of the traditional image of the Mississippi, and in providing a carefully balanced stylistic rendition of these he creates a restrained panegyric of the river and thus enhances its iconic presence in the American imagination.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s05">
         <title>V</title>
         <p>In that carefully balanced stylistic rendition there is one component that deserves special attention: the word “rolling.” Not at all unusual in connection with sea and river, it occurs in nineteenth-century popular songs such as Epes Sargent's “A Life on the Ocean Wave” and Reginald Heber's “From Greenland's Icy Mountains” as well as in “Roll, Jordan, Roll,” the African American spiritual. While the power of the latter moved Mark Twain as late as 1904 in the composition of “No. 44, The Mysterious Stranger,” he is known ever to have been enthralled by the lines “A life on the ocean wave! A home on the rolling deep!” as much as by “From Greenland's icy mountains, from India's coral strand; Where Afric's sunny fountains roll down their golden sand….” Heber's song he once referred to as his “favorite poem” (<italic>Following the Equator</italic> 2:209), while the title of Sargent's song turns up in a humorous context as early as in the story of the scriptural panoramist in a contribution to the <italic>Californian</italic> of November 18, 1865, and again in Chapter 38 of <italic>Life on the Mississippi</italic>. Its famous opening lines are also to be found in Chapter 1 of <italic>Old Times on the Upper Mississippi</italic>, a 1909 memoir by George Byron Merrick, a river pilot himself from 1854 to 1863, who recalls the appeal “the suggestive words of the song” had had as long ago as his childhood days in the 1840s (16). Mark Twain's own use of the word “rolling” is somewhat different in that he turns it into a transitive verb. It is the Mississippi that is “rolling its mile-wide tide along,” and this conceit contributes to the impression of the magnitude of the mighty river as a powerful force, as a potent agent, as an animate being even, fully deserving of the adjectives “great,” “majestic,” and “magnificent.”</p>
         <p>A most important facet implied in the range of the semantic meaning covered by “rolling” or “to roll” is the notion of space that is necessary for the activity of rolling to unfold. By way of illustration, here are two random examples from the text of Henry James's <italic>The American Scene</italic>, his travel account of 1907: “a breaking of the waves that had rolled, for their welter on this very strand, from the other side of the globe” (195); “the drift of the warm flood of appreciation […] set rolling over a field of prepared sensibility […]” (258). To which may be added two quotations from Mark Twain himself, the first from a description of Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea in his Sandwich Islands lecture as delivered in 1869–1870: “high above the rolling plain of clouds themselves, stands the awful summit”; the second from an account of his overland journey as given in Chapter 2 of <italic>Roughing It</italic> (1872): “We were spinning along through Kansas, and in the course of an hour and a half we were fairly abroad on the great Plains. Just here the land was rolling—a grand sweep of regular elevations and depressions as far as the eye could reach—like the stately heave and swell of the ocean's bosom after a storm. And everywhere were cornfields, accenting with squares of deeper green, this limitless expanse of grassy land” (6). In the context of our sentence, thus, in “the great Mississippi, the majestic, the magnificent Mississippi, rolling its mile-wide tide along,” every single word contributes to define the magnitude as well as the power of the river, in terms of both space and force. Even the conclusion, “… shining in the sun,” implicitly strengthens that impression by hinting at the ease with which the task is achieved. While the focus is on the activity itself, there is the concomitant suggestion of space and of the spaciousness of the scenery, the setting in which all is taking place, and the awareness that the scenery is American and that space is its defining feature.</p>

      <sec id="s06">
         <title>VI</title>
         <p>There is every reason, then, to argue that it is this implication of the use of the word “rolling” that gives Mark Twain's sentence its rightful place among texts that celebrate the American scenery and that in like manner make use of the same word to suggest spaciousness as an indigenous quality of America. My contention takes us back in time to William Cullen Bryant, and forward in time to F. Scott Fitzgerald, from a moment by the Mississippi, as it were, to a moment on the Prairies and a moment by the Atlantic.</p>
         <p>In 1832 Bryant paid a visit to Illinois and was much impressed when he first saw the Prairies. A year later he wrote his well-known poem in panegyric celebration of this unique feature of the American scenery: “These are the gardens of the desert, these / The unshorn fields, boundless and beautiful, / For which the speech of England has no name— / The Prairies.” To suggest the magnitude of “the encircling vastness” that surrounds him, the poet uses the metaphor of the sea: to the visitor the Prairies stretch “in airy undulations,” like an ocean, the “rounded billows fixed.” Then, suddenly, by “breezes of the South,” they are unchained, and now “the surface rolls and fluctuates to the eye.” As in Mark Twain's panegyric to the Mississippi it is through anthropomorphic metaphor that “rolling” is brought in to help to visualize and effectively accentuate the impressive vastness and the solitude as distinctive features of the immediate scene and the American landscape in general. The 1848 text for a picture of the so-called “Rolling Prairie” in Henry Lewis's <italic>Das Illustrirte Mississippithal</italic>, for instance, confirms the prevalence of such associations: “stretching from the western boundaries of Missouri and Iowa towards the setting sun, the rolling prairies are seen in their greatest sublimity. There, without seeing a tree or stream of water, the traveler may wander for days and discover nothing but a grassy ocean, bounded on all sides by the horizon” (Petersen 51). And Richard Ford in his recent novel <italic>Canada</italic> (2012) testifies to the continuity of such imagery when he has Bev Parsons talk expansively of “the prairie like a great inland sea (‘like the Gulf of Mexico’)” (71), like “an ocean” (72).</p>
         <p>Both the presentation of the panorama of “Old Times on the Mississippi” and that of Bryant's “The Prairies” as significant vistas of the American landscape quite appropriately involve implicit and explicit meditations on time. Mark Twain is recalling “old times,” and Bryant is pondering the course of human history and America's role in it. F. Scott Fitzgerald's <italic>The Great Gatsby</italic>, set in 1922 and published in 1925, ends with a similar reflection in a location marked as significant in a much-acclaimed passage of heightened prose. Sprawled out on the sand of the beach of Long Island Sound, on the last night before his return to the Midwest, Nick Carraway, the narrator, reflects on the fate of Jay Gatsby, the protagonist. Carraway sees Gatsby's fate in relation to that of his nation, to the land as it first appeared to Dutch sailors' eyes—“a fresh, green breast of the new world” (140). That world has long since disappeared, however; rural values have been replaced by those of the city, and Gatsby's dream has been lost with it. “He did not know,” Carraway concludes, “that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night” (141). Not actually in a visual image in this instance, but in an imaginary one, the word “rolled” once again serves to suggest spaciousness and magnitude and presents these as defining features of the American landscape. The Mississippi, the Prairies, and the dark fields of the republic, spreading in the sunshine, animated by southern breezes, or reposing under a night sky, are thus brought together thematically and by style, as it were, to support one another in their importance as memorable verbal icons of American scenery.</p>

      <sec id="s07">
         <title>VII</title>
         <p>Once we perceive this relatedness of Mark Twain's eulogistic sentence, or rather, once we perceive its potential to be viewed as part of such relatedness, it seems a mere matter of course to transfer the connotative accretion of the word “rolling,” its symbolic accrual in terms of national significance, to the word “shining” in the final part of the sentence: “shining in the sun.” Over and beyond suggesting a pleasing aspect of the great river in its impressive magnitude, “shining” evokes other texts and contexts just as “rolling” does. First and foremost there is John Winthrop's image of the “City upon a Hill” as invoked in “A Model of Christian Charity,” a speech in which he addressed his fellow passengers of the <italic>Arbella</italic> in 1630. Taking recourse to its biblical origin, the image soon picked up the adjective “shining,” and as the “shining City upon a Hill” it early became a key phrase in the rhetoric of American exceptionalism and the concept of manifest destiny. It has been kept alive ever since, frequently exploited of late, with much effect, in the rhetoric of American presidents and presidential candidates. The implication of “shining,” in this context, is not merely “shining with light” or “shining in the light of something,” but more specifically “shining in celestial light” or “shining in light as sent by God.” This readily takes us to another, somewhat later text that similarly celebrates the beauty of America as much as its exceptional place among nations in well-known words: Katharine Lee Bates's “America the Beautiful.” The first and the last stanza of this poem, which was first published in a magazine on July 4, 1895, and then became a patriotic song, end with the same invocation: “America, America! / God shed his grace on thee, / And crown thy good with brotherhood / From sea to shining sea!” Once again, American scenery in its sublime beauty, the starting point of Bates's text and her actual inspiration during her first visit to the summit of Pikes Peak, Colorado, in 1893, becomes transparent, as it were, to reveal glimpses of a divine plan and the blessings of heaven.</p>
         <p>As in the case of <italic>The Great Gatsby</italic>, I am calling on a later text, not to explicate the ancestry or the derivation of Mark Twain's sentence, but to point to a larger inter-textual relatedness that helps us to recognize and to appreciate that sentence in its enduring potential to engage the reader. As much as the Mississippi itself in its role (its changing role) in the rhetoric of manifest destiny—as a river to reach and then to cross in the movement of westward expansion, as a river to facilitate that expansion by providing a route for immigrants to travel north to reach the starting points of westward trails, and then as the most conspicuous feature of the Mississippi Valley as a whole (invoked again and again as the so-called Body of the Nation when the aim of the concept of manifest destiny shifted to stress the idea of union and of the indivisibility of the nation)—so Mark Twain's eulogistic sentence in praise of it embodies the multifaceted essence of a geopolitical force central to the fate of the American republic. In the period between his boyhood days in Hannibal and his writing about them for the <italic>Atlantic</italic>, Mark Twain had come to understand the paramount importance of the Mississippi River in the history of America as well as in pertinent political rhetoric and the American imagination generally. In using a panegyric style and words with their connotative accretions in terms of national significance, his sentence does justice to that realization. When in 1883 “Old Times on the Mississippi” became a part of <italic>Life on the Mississippi</italic> he chose for a motto the text of the “Editor's Table” of <italic>Harper's Magazine</italic> of February 1863, titled “The ‘Body of the Nation.’” Echoing Abraham Lincoln's Annual Message to Congress of December 1, 1862, with its urgent plea for national unity and Lincoln's reference to “the great body of the republic” (528), it defines “the basin of the Mississippi” as “the Body of the Nation,” all the other parts being “but members, important in themselves, yet more important in relation to this” (<italic>Life on the Mississippi</italic> 5). The motto thus proclaims as well as demands awareness of the river's significance in matters of national import. Much like what the famous slogan “Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way” does when it is used as a title for Frances F. Palmer's seemingly realistic landscape painting of 1868 and notably its countless Currier and Ives lithograph reproductions,<sup>2</sup> the motto promotes and supports the reading of the author's one-sentence image of the Mississippi as a kind of emblem. In this way his sentence eclipses all previous efforts in praise of the river and has become what is probably the most quoted sentence about the Mississippi.</p>
         <p>Rather than give representative examples from the long list of such quotations—in promotional literature, travel accounts and memoirs, in biographical and critical studies of the author—I should like to conclude with a recent instance of less likely provenance. In 2010, L. D. Bonner, a photographer from Seattle, published a photo, “Mighty Mississippi,” on the Internet and added our sentence by way of amplifying his title. He earned applause for both his capture and for what a reader referred to as a “very interesting write-up.” To which Bonner responded as follows: “I think Mark Twain is easily the Father of the Mississippi. Who better to quote, right?”</p>
