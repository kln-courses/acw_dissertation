OXFORD. FERNAND CHAPOUTHIER. Les Dioscures au service d'une deesse (Bibl. des ec. franc. d'Athenes et de Rome, 137). E. de Boccard. Paris, 1935. Pp. viii + 381, with 16 plates and 67 figures. 60 fr. This is a model investigation, which has already received the unqualified praise of M. P. Nilsson (Gnomon, XII [1936], pp. 43 if.). Chapouthier is concerned with the monuments " ou les Dioscures, symmetriquement places, accompagnent une divinite feminine." After an amusing survey of the history of the problem, he classifies a series of related iconographic types. We have the goddess without attributes between two riders; we have the goddess (a) with attributes which are not distinctive; (b) with a crescent (or indicated simply by a crescent, without an anthropomorphic representation); (c) the goddess with nimbus; (d) the goddess with star; (e) the goddess who has easily recognizable emblems (Cybele or her equivalents, Ourania Hera, Ephesian Artemis, Hecate, Tyche, Astarte); (f) such emblems (lion, cornucopiae, ear of corn, Isiac sign, torch) between two pilei; (g) doubtful instances. All this is set forth in a clear and well-illustrated catalogue. Chapouthier then analyzes the chronological and geographical distribution of these forms, finding that, while somewhat am- biguous versions in the shorthand of coins occur in the third century B. C., full representations range from the end of the second century B. C. to the third century A. D. We shall consider the geographical facts later, but we may here note his observation that the dedicators of reliefs of this kind are pre- dominantly men.' He proceeds to show the coherence of these various series. He finds at the heart of the development the old group of Helen and the Dioscuri: the tree-goddess, from whom poetry had made a symbol of the beauty which catches the throat and masters the will, and the heroes of young manhood, chivalrous in aid.2 He reminds us that Helen remained a figure of cult,3 and then indi- 1We need a general study of the relative distribution of dedications to different gods and goddesses as between men and women. 2 Like Heracles and Dionysus, the Dioscuri were during and after the Hellentistic period regular types of men raised to godhead for services to humanity (e.g., Diels, Doxographi, p. 297). 8 Cf., above all, Herodotus, VI, 61, a very early aretalogy. 344</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS. cates how it was that the same type fitted the Samothracian deities. His discussion of the nature of these mysterious figures and of their Hellenistic identification with the Dioscuri deserves particular attention. Helen and the Dioscuri provided a nucleus for crystallization; but where did the iconographic type arise? It cannot be a new creation of the Hellenistic period. The author rejects certain tempting alternatives and gives his vote for an Anatolian pro- cessional representation. Whether or not he is correct, he has gathered most valuable and pertinent material and he has given an ideal example of how such an investigation should be con- ducted. Thereafter, he studies the vicissitudes of the type as applied to other deities as far east as Palmyra; the pages devoted to astral interpretations and to the " Danubian tablets " are note- worthy. Passing westwards he treats Roman representations of the Dioscuri now associated with Juppiter, Roman speculations concerning them, the assimilation of the Lares to the Dioscuri, and the theoretical ascription to the Dioscuri of the function of being attendants of Hades. He concludes with general con- siderations on the fratres Helenae and on analogies outside the Graeco-Roman world. We may now turn to the geographical distribution of the art- type. Chapouthier finds it to be predominantly Greek and remarks that it is present where Mithraism is absent, and absent where Mithraism is present. From Gaul we have only the Macon 4 and Vienne statuettes, and in them the busts of the Dioscuri are but part of the divine entourage of a Tyche. From Germany we have only the Nehwiller-les-Woerth plaques; from the Danube valley no representations; from Rome, nothing save a derivative (the way in which the Lares are shown on either side of Vesta).5 The epithet Hypsistos, in the combinations Zeus Hypsistos and Theos Hypsistos, presents an interesting analogy. It is found widely over the Greek half of the world. The art-type emerges as something belonging to Helen and the Dioscuri and can be taken to mean Cybele and the Cabiri, etc.; so Hypsistos starts from the native Zeus Hypsistos, so called as supreme god or as skygod or as mountain god, and is then applied to Jahwe, Semitic Baalim, and any local dominant god of Asia Minor or Thrace.6 The epithet and the art-type are not distributed identically, but there is a general similarity. Hypsistos struck very deep roots in the Semitic world, where the art-type appears only incidentally. Found in Egypt, Hypsistos is not (unless we accept a doubtful interpretation) applied to an Egyptian deity, 'On this cf. M. P. Nilsson, ARW., XXIII (1925), p. 182. Also a possible derivative of Syrian type at Herculaneum (p. 278). 8 345</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. as the art-type is. Hypsistos occurs occasionally in Crete 7 and reaches up into Moesia, where the art-type has not yet been found, while the latter reached Africa,8 where Hypsistos appears only (as altissimus) in curse tablets, and magic is a cosmopolitan art. Both are in effect strangers to the western half of the world.9 Summus would seem the natural equivalent of Hypsis- tos, but though used in literature from the time of Plautus, it seems hardly to be found in religious inscriptions except as com- bined with exsuperantissimus, an epithet applied from the middle of the second century A. D. to Iuppiter Optimus Maxi- mus and Iuppiter Dolichenus.10 Even for this the number of instances is very small as compared with the Greek material. Is the answer as follows? Rome had Castor and Pollux from of old, but their female associate Juturna had faded, and they were, as Chapouthier shows, grouped with Juppiter.11 Their combination with Helen was in the Near East a feature of iconographic style, which rested on old linking in worship and myth. But it was not the badge of any particular group or nationality and it had not evolved a mystery cult capable of being exported. Hypsistos, in its turn, was not, except for Jew and Judaizers and perhaps for some devotees at Palmyra, a name fraught with emotion. Hardly any one else would have any special interest in transporting either the art-type or the epi- thet in question. Art-type and epithet alike, again, were not automatically intelligible except to those who used them. Con- trast Mithras, Sabazios, and Zeus of Doliche, who were dissemi- nated by eager worshippers, and who carried with them their own formulas and iconography. I may add that, as far as we know, the group of Helen and the Dioscuri was not handled by any famous artist whose work would of itself have inspired imitation. Here we have two facts which seem of some importance for the 7 To the material listed in the article quoted in the last note add M.

Lincei, 1899, p. 533; 1901, p. 299 (two dedications to Oebs i,taros from Gortyn). 8 Greek influence was strong here. 9 The bust with Theos Hypsistos at Rome is of unknown provenance: IG, XIV, 995. We have at Rome also the purely Greek Atl 'Trdrwt on a cippus, ibid. 994. 10 Cf. F. Cumont, ARW, IX (1906), pp. 323 ff. For summus we have IOM. summo excellentissimo at Capua (CIL, X, 3805); IOM. summo in Gaul (CIL, XII, 1533) is very dubious; IOM. summo exsuperantis- simo at Utrecht (Dess., ILS, 3094) seems the only example from Gaul or Germany. So, though altus is used of Iuppiter summ (anus) in CIL, V, 5660 (in agro Mediolanensi), I know no epigraphic example of altissimus applied to a god except in defixiones. 11 Their lack of a signicant female consort is illustrated by the fact that ecastor or mecastor was a usual oath for women. 346</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS. religious differentiation of the Eastern and Western halves of the Empire.12 Those who approach Chapouthier's book with other preoccupations should find plenty for their own purposes. ARTHUR DARBY NOCK. HARVARD UNIVERSITY. J. F. MOUNTFORD, The Scholia Bembina. Liverpool, University Press (London, Hodder and Stoughton), 1934. Pp. vii + 131. 10 s. 6 d. This work concerns itself with approximately fifteen hundred marginal and interlinear scholia added in the famous codex Bem- binus of Terence (A, Vat. lat. 3226) after the changes of the original scribe (A1), the early corrector (A2), and the mys- terious Ioviales. Though these scholia have frequently been studied before, most recently and successfully by Umpfenbach, Studemund, and Kauer, our author has not merely emended the reports of these scholars (and others, including Lindsay, Notae Latinae) but has also discovered between eighty or ninety items not previously reported. The work is arranged as follows: first, a brief historical in- troduction (1); then discussions concerning the number of scholiasts (2), the date of the scholia (3), the palaeography of hands 1 (4) and 2 (5), and the method of the edition (8); next, the actual scholia (11; there is none for the Hec.); then discussions concerning the relationship of the scholia to the text of Terence (113), their sources (116), and their relationship to Eugraphius (118) and Donatus (119); and, finally, conclu- sions (126) and an index (127; including points of orthography and non-classical words). The method of editing the scholia is beyond reproach: numerous critical signs indicate, as well as any artificial means can, the actual condition of the manuscript. Several points raised in the discussion, however, require comment. Our author's account of the number of the scholiasts and of their work, for example, seems fairly convincing, yet it can hardly be evaluated without the help of facsimiles of the Bembine manu- script. That there is not available a suitable folio showing the 12 I hope to return to this topic elsewhere. Meanwhile, I observe that the Latin-speaking world uses deus aeternus, which does not, I think, have a precise equivalent in Greek, to describe in a generalizing way an Eastern (probably Syrian) deity: a fact the importance of which remains after we have noted Cumont's observation, Rev. arch., 1888, that a number of dedicants have names indicating Near Eastern descent; but the Latin world does not copy Oebos acy wv, Oebs 6ialo Kal $iKatos. Note also 0. Weinreich, Menekrates Zeus u. Salmoneus, p. 6, n. 18 for a solitary Latin copying of the Ala--aL formula. 347</page></plain_text>
