(i) Traditional Origins of Carving Art: Maori traditions ascribe to Rau the son of Toi who lived at the Bay of Plenty over twenty-six generations ago the invention of the present style of Maori carving. Thus tradition supports the " endemic " origin of art in New Zealand.1 According to the East Coast story the art of carving originated with the gods themselves who were its first practitioners. One Rua-i-te-pukenga introduced carving into the world. Yet another story is that Hura-waikato was the first wood-carver ; but by some tribes Mata-ora is credited with the discovery. Te Whatu of Tuhoe is reported to have said : " Mata-ora was an ancestor of the very remote past. He it was who first taught the art of piercing (poka) in wood carving. His knowledge descended to Rua." Te Tini o te Haku turi, a tribe of wood fairies of Hawaiki taught Rua the art and he obtained patterns from spider's web.2 (ii) Ethnological View of Origins: These legends are in themselves valuable as expressions of the poetic mind of the Polynesians, but however fascinating they may be, the problem of origins is ethnological. The special problem of art in New Zealand is whether we can ascribe the major characters of Maori art to local development, or to an old art revitalized to an almost unrecognizable form by the stimulus of a new geographical environ ment, and new material resources of wood and stone unknown in Central Polynesia. The curvilinear style of developed Maori art would appear opposed to the basically rectilinear style of the parent Central Polynesian art. This fundamental problem is closely tied with the problem of origins, and remains largely unexplained. At first glance it would appear that the curvilinear style was introduced into New Zealand from Melanesia where the curvilinear style is typical.3 In an early paper (1916) Skinner suggested that in Maori art " the fusion of these two diverse elements produced a vigorous and fertile native art, derived from Melanesia and Polynesia but marked by new and distinctive characteristics of its own. It is with these two Oceanic areas, and not, as is often confidently asserted, with India and Eastern Asia or with America, that Maori art is most closely connected."4 Hamilton 1896:7. 2 Firth 1925:284. 3 Best 1923:321. 4 Skinner 1916 : Introduction.</page><page sequence="2">306 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY It is reasonably well established that the earliest New Zealanders were migrants from Central Polynesia, the first wave probably arriving about five hundred years before the great canoe migration of 1350 A.D. Percy Smith set this date and the date of the Polynesian navigator Kupe's discovery of New Zealand at 925 A.D., using genealogies which appear reasonably accurate.5 As there is what at present appears to be quite satisfactory evidence that the first New Zealand inhabitants came from Tahiti and nearby groups, we can be confident that the first art created by man in this country was Central Polynesian in character. This would suggest that later Maori art would follow basically similar styles and patterns. However, an examination of Maori wood carving quickly convinces us that the problem is not quite so simple. In the comparatively short time-interval, say about five hundred years after the arrival of the great canoes Tainui, Te Arawa, Matatua, Kurahaupo, Tokomaru, Aotea, and Takitimu, to mention only the more important, Maori art as the first Europeans found it, was curvilinear in style and of great vigour, while the contemporary style of Central Polynesia was basically rectilinear. A fact not generally realized is that Abel Tasman visited New Zealand only 292 years, and Captain James Cook 419 years, after the arrival of the great canoe migration of the fourteenth century. Tasman had no chance of observing Maori art, but Cook found a vigorous curvilinear art which differed from the Central Polynesian style. How did such radical changes occur? Why did Maori art depart from the concepts of its parent Polynesian culture ? Probably the seeds of the curvilinear style which later flourished in New Zealand were present in the art of the first migrants. Early scholars believed that the first New Zealand settlers were of Melanesian origin. This would, if true, have greatly simplified the problem of curvilinear elements in New Zealand art, but no archaeological or other evidence supports this theory. Excavations by Eyles and Duff at the Wairau Bar were conclusive.0 At this remarkable site of the pre-Fleet moa-hunting Maori on the southern shores of Cook Strait, the graves and middens yielded evidence of a distinctly Polynesian culture. Factual archaeological evidence quietened the Melanesian theorists, and supported the earlier work of Skinner and Teviotdale,7 for both had early recognised the essentially Polynesian character of sites in Otago and Canterbury. At one time or another numerous corners of the earth have been suggested as the Far-Hawaiki?the Distant Homeland of the Poly nesians. Consequently the discussion of ultimate origins has fallen into disrepute : certainly at times it could be one of the most tedious and unreal of topics. On the positive side, an exact knowledge of Polynesian origins would give us a deeper understanding of the nature of their arts and culture. Firth has expressed the true value of these studies. He says, " The problem of Polynesian origins has a kind of detective interest, with tantalizing clues pointing in various directions?to Indo 5 Smith 1915:71. e Duff 1950. 7 Teviotdale 1932.</page><page sequence="3">Maori Decorative Carving?An Outline 307 nesia, to Indo-China, to China proper, to Japan, and even to the North West coast of America. And the solution, if discovered, would be of the utmost importance for the understanding of that peculiar genius of the Polynesian people which is expressed in a combination of realism and practicality with a deep feeling for etiquette and ritual of a high artistic quality."8 The Kon-Tiki drift voyage from South America to Polynesia has popularized a view that the Polynesians came from the east. To the seafaring Polynesians however, Te Rangi Hiroa's Vikings of the Sun rise, the sunset symbolized death and the spirit land whence they had come and whither all returned. The sunrise in the East symbolized the hope of new lands.9 This ethnic psychology, closely woven into the mythology of Polynesia, would suggest a migratory movement from West to East?that is from the Indonesian region into the vast Pacific, and not from South America. Further, the evidence of language, race, and art form confirms this view. Although drift voyages no doubt played a large part in the settlement of Polynesia, it is known that the Polynesian ancestors were purposeful navigators with well-designed, manoeuverable craft, which under reasonable conditions of wind and current, sailed in the direction the navigator wished to go. No doubt the Kon-Tiki drift voyage from South America made by Thor Heyer dahl and his plucky crew has contributed to our knowledge of Poly nesian origins in-so-far as it suggests that Polynesia received a share of unwilling raft-drifting migrants from distant South America, but there is no evidence that they came in sufficient numbers to transform the basically South-East Asian and Indonesian character of Polynesia. Heyerdahl in his massive work10 stated the case in favour of American origins in a manner that has convinced many people, yet the weight of evidence, i.e., racial, linguistic and cultural, allows us fairly to conclude that the Polynesians moved into Polynesia from the west and not from the east.11 The Maori Artist. (i) The Origins of his Art: The Maori artist and his arresting art belong to the neolithic culture of Polynesia. Although Maori art may be justly classed as " primitive " in the accepted sense of the word, the sophistication of its forms, concepts, and techniques, suggest it is the product of a people whose ancestors possessed a culture more advanced than what is usually 8 Firth in a Preface, see Williamson 1937: Preface XV. 9 Buck 1938: Prologue VII. 10 Heyerdahl 1952. 11 The most notable exponent of the west-east theory of Polynesian migration was, of course, Sir Peter Buck. Skinner's paper " The Origin and Relationship of Maori Material Culture," published in 1924 (J.P.S. 33:229 243) is an early relevant paper of special interest. It is not without signifi cance that many supporters of the orthodox idea of migration from the general Indonesian and south-east Asian region have had long association with Oceanic material in museums. This is true of England as well as New Zealand.</page><page sequence="4">308 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY described as primitive. In reviewing the question of Polynesian origins above, it was suggested that the weight of evidence, linguistic, racial and cultural as manifested in art form and custom, indicate major migrations from Indonesia and neighbouring areas. If this view is accepted, it must follow, that the distant ancestors of the Polynesians were people in contact with sophisticated and subtle civilizations. Therefore we must not assume that Polynesian art is an evolution from primitive beginnings : rather, it is an art that underwent a con siderable simplification through loss of basic materials and techniques of a higher culture as the Polynesian ancestors moved into the restrictive environment of the South Seas. To this restriction of environment is due the substitution of stone for metal, the extinction of arts such as ceramics and true weaving which introduced a more elemental interpretation of nature, and probably caused a certain " primitive " element to replace the more diverse sophistication of Indonesia. Yet the Maori artist retained much of his distant ancestry. Beneath the apparent savagery and barbarism of Maori art forms, one may discern an heritage of sensitivity, not discernible in all arts of the world that are justly called primitive. (ii) Position of the Primitive Artist: The arts of the Polynesian Maori of New Zealand take a foremost place in the world's arts which anthropologists conventionally term primitive. Maori art at the time of first European contact possessed a vigour and accomplishment, especially in wood sculpture, that is in its own way unparalleled. However it is only over the past half century that the aesthetic merit of primitive art has been widely recognized, through advances in our ov/n artistic concepts made broad by such workers as Picasso, and a deeper understanding brought about by advances in psychology, particularly ethnopsychology, and studies in social anthropology. Missionaries at first viewed primitive arts as devil inspired, to be taken home as evidence of the barbarity and degradation of the native. The primitive artist found little inspiration from European contacts. Paradoxically, European artists have recently found great stimulating force in the formerly despised primitive concepts. Firth lists the reasons for this belated appreciation in a penetrat ing essay on the social framework of primitive art. These factors he lists as: (a) unfamiliarity of primitive work; (b) lack of sufficiently analytical aesthetic theory to allow the relevant principles to be dis entangled; (c) the unconscious view that the primitive was racially inferior and thus incapable of significant cultural achievements; (d) confusion of categories of judgement, and finally; (e) the interfer ence of moral and religious criteria in the appraisal of art. Under these influences there was little chance of the primitive artist getting a fair aesthetic trial.12 This brings us to the principle of judgement wisely pointed out by Linton and Wingert, that in our growing appreciation of world art each separate art can be best appreciated in the context of i2 Firth 1951:156-9,</page><page sequence="5">Maori Decorative Carving?An Outline 309 its own civilization.11 Certainly a fuller understanding of Oceanic art in general, and Maori art in particular, can be achieved only by linking the symbolism and function of art objects with the cultural, spiritual, and mental concepts that brought such objects into existence. Modern psychology, and rapid advances in social anthropology, are providing us with the means of placing art expression of one kind or another in correct cultural contexts. The truth that must always be kept in mind when considering the primitive artist is that he is first and foremost a craftsman from whom art flows as an extension of his craft activity. Things are constructed for use, and not merely for the aesthetic satisfaction of looking at them.14 This is certainly true of the Maori artist. Whereas the artist and craftsman in our modern society is frequently an out-cast and not socially acceptable, the primitive artist is usually an honoured artisan accepted by his society. Since his art had a vital social function, good art resulted. In Polynesia craftsmen formed a kind of aristocracy, nowhere more so than in New Zealand, where the artist was of the priestly or tohunga class. This social need for the artist, typical of primitive societies, accounts for the consistently high standards and persistence of conventions that one comes to expect in ethnic arts. Objects of Maori art collected by early voyagers, settlers and missionaries, rarely falls below a high aesthetic standard. Although inferior workmanship is evident in even the earliest collections of Maori carving, such second or third grade work is the exception. The usual standard is excellence. The spirit of the old carvers is well told in an anecdote related by Firth, a tale originally told by General Robley in his Pounamu, 1915. Firth tells of several old chiefs who were more than half an hour late for an appointment with the governor of the day. On arrival they excused themselves on the ground, that they had been so absorbed with their carving chisels, that the time had passed without them being aware of it.15 In this same remarkable paper, " The Maori Carver," Firth stresses that in order to appreciate the full value of primitive art it is necessary to study art not only in museum cases where things tend to be dead and isolated, but to try to place objects in their original and natural setting such as villages, and homes, where they are full of life and character. It is essential to grasp the social aspect of Maori art if its true nature is to be comprehended. Technique, methods, pro cesses, and functions, are of importance in the social scheme of the people who produce such art, therefore they must be considered if we are to understand Maori art forms fully.ie (iii) Social Purposes of the Maori Artist: The Polynesian art of New Zealand is more secular than that of Central Polynesia. It is primarily functional and is closely related to 13 Linton and Wingert 1946:8. 14 Firth 1951:171. is Firth 1952:281-2. 1G ibid. 278,</page><page sequence="6">310 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY architecture, a fact substantiated in a recent study by Archey, who aptly states that Maori wood carving never lost its primary social purposes and inspiration. " That purpose was commemoration, the perpetuation of the memory of tribal leaders and ancestors. So moti vated, Maori art inevitably appears as an art of the human figure, an art of statuary. It also became a complexity of involved designs. While these two, sculpture and decorative design, are the poles of Maori carving, they are not poles apart and unrelated; there is ... a con tinuous theme of development between them, a theme that maintains a harmony of historic meaning with every nuance or variation of form."17 Firth also recognises the social purposes of Maori art, particularly as expressed in the carved slabs of meeting houses, which he cites as an excellent example, as they serve a real social purpose by perpetuating the memory and exploits of famous ancestors. Though they were primarily a means of adornment, by adding beauty and prestige to a carved meeting house (whare whakairo), they were not set up from any specific religious motive. The fact is, that ideas are much more easily developed in the mind if they have some material object round which they may centre, and these interior house panels or poupou acted as a stimulus to memory, a focus round which clustered the thoughts and tales of the people concerning their past. Thus even the names given to the carved meeting houses helped to keep fresh the memory of persons or events of former days.18 Archey, a consistently original writer on Maori art, developed this theme in his recent discussion of Maori sculpture and design. He observed the limitation of architectural requirements on form and conception of the human figure, and the failure of the Maori sculptor to express bodily freedom and activity but without loss of liveliness. The influence of house-building which served as an incentive for extending the portrayal of tribal history Archey points out, was thus a challenge of applied architectural sculpture, the requirements of which, were not necessarily a limitation but became in fact, " an opportunity and a stimulus for an enterprise that was to carry the Maori carver forward into a richly-diversified decorative art. For instance, there are more planks than posts in Maori houses ; planks provide room for the human figure to be widened and for its now broad features, limbs, shoulders, thighs, feet, to become areas for decoration. But they still combine structural and sculptural quality with com memorative purpose, as when Ngangaia and Matatahi, ancestors of the Ngatimaru tribe, stand part of the wall of Ngatimaru's tribal meeting house Hotunui ;19 and with fifty other carved ancestors are at once the essential structure of the house, the history of the tribe and integration of the community."20 " Archey 1955:3. 18 Firth 1925:279. 19 The Auckland Institute and Museum's carved meeting house. 20 Archey 1955:5-6.</page><page sequence="7">Maori Decorative Carving?An Outline 311 Cultural Definitions in Oceania. Before proceeding to a special study of the scope, basic character, and symbols of Maori art, it is necessary to outline the geographic and cultural background of the wide Oceanian area of which New Zealand is a small unit. The arts of the vast Pacific area are as manifold as its races, and the variety of art styles greater than in Africa. Oceanian arts are not exactly primitive : on the contrary they are quite sophisti cated.21 The most remarkable feature of Oceanic art is that regardless of long distances of time and space coupled with great racial and cultural diversity, the art forms exhibit an underlying unity. Oceania we may say, forms in itself one distinctive unit in world art. It is a single culture area. (i) Geographical Areas in Oceania: The South Pacific is customarily divided into five areas where all the major groups of mankind are well represented. Wingert defines these as : Indonesia, Melanesia, Australia, Micronesia, and Polynesia.22 The geographical extent of these is briefly as follows: Indonesia lies east and north-east as a crescent off the south-eastern most tip of Asia. The islands within this area are usually mountainous and are not widely separated by sea. Indonesia is believed to be the gateway through which native migrants have passed into the Pacific?Moana-nui-a-Kiwa, the Great Ocean of Kiwa, the romantic home of the South Sea islanders. Melanesia stretches south-east for about three thousand miles from (and including) New Guinea. The racial stock of this area is Negroid Melanesian and Papuan. To the south of New Guinea lies Australia, which although included in the Oceanian area is racially and artistically isolated from other Oceanian areas except for points on the northern coasts. Micronesia comprises a galaxy of small islands which spread across the north of Melanesia, reaching from the Philippine Islands to the fringes of Western Polynesia. The inhabitants of these low coral atolls are yellower skinned, more Mongoloid than their Polynesian relatives, and are considered the most recent arrivals in the Pacific, with the exception of course of Europeans. Polynesia proper forms a great equilateral triangle with sides of about 5,000 miles. The area is neatly marked by Hawaii in the north, Easter Island to the east, and New Zealand in the south-west, Odd islands supporting Polynesian groups also occur in Melanesia and Micronesia, and the accepted triangle of Polynesia is defined in general terms, without scientific precision. (ii) Culture Areas in Oceania: Wingert has observed that the great distances separating the many islands of Polynesia has tended to isolate them from each other, con sequently there has developed throughout these islands variations of basically similar culture elements. Fundamental differences do occur however, for example, Polynesian art, while it is both decorative and expressive, does not emphasize the dramatic effects as does Melanesian 21 Adam 1940:151-2. 22 Wingert 1953:15.</page><page sequence="8">312 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY art. Throughout Oceania sculpture is dominant and a wide variety of materials are used. The subject most commonly encountered in all areas is the human figure.23 The basic art trends in each of the three related Oceanian areas have been concisely formulated by Linton and Wingert as: (a) Micro nesia?natural forms simplified with ornamentation growing out of function and technique; (b) Melanesia?natural forms exaggerated and distorted with rhythmic organic curved surfaces ; (c) Polynesia? natural forms geometrized with intricate surface patterns.24 New Zealand with a curvilinear art is something of a misfit in this classica tion, an anomaly which will receive further treatment. To attempt to analyse the historic processes in the distribution, or the inter-relation ships of these trends, would be outside the scope of this essay. The Basic Characters of Maori Art. Maori art is normally a kind of decorative by-product of crafts men engaged in making the common objects of every-day or ceremonial use. Art for art's sake was not consciously practised, although the story of the old chiefs so absorbed with their carving that they were late to see the governor, suggests that the sheer love of decorating for its own sake at times absorbed the Maori craftsman's attention. Firth points out that carving was looked upon as a dignified art not at all degrading to a man of rank. Chiefs often occupied themselves in carving feather boxes (waka huia), bowls, or adze handles.25 The diversity of style and sheer artistic beauty of ivaka huia suggests they represent the concen trated skill of men who made them for the simple love of decoration. No carved objects in the field of Maori art surpass them for originality, vigour, or as demonstrations of local style. A curious feature of these boxes is that they are usually best carved on the bottom, the reason is that as they were normally hoisted to a rafter or beam, they would be viewed from below. This use also accounts for the suspension lugs or holes at both ends of these boxes, a functional need that was also turned to decorative ends. The Oldman Collection offers a particularly fine range of these " trinket " boxes.20 Hamilton in his classic work on Maori artistry states that decora tion with elaboration of detail is typical, and that the Maori sense of fitness prevailed (in the ancient work at least), never allowing ornament to interfere with the primary purpose and free use of the object. From a general point of view Hamilton considered the whole art work of the Maori as coming under the head of ornament with the following characteristics: (1) the application of ornament; (2) a conservative character or type of ornament, and (3) each " tribe " giving its own rendering of the distinctive local type.27 Leenhardt calls the Maori artist a decorator.28 Maori art would appear then to be an adornment 23 Wingert 1953:20-23. 24 Linton and Wingert 1946:9. 2?5 Firth 1925:280. 2? Oldman 1938: see plates 36 to 46. 27 Hamilton 1896:6. 28 Leenhardt 1950:116,</page><page sequence="9">Maori Decorative Carving?An Outline 313 of the practical, although sometimes the Maori artist was concerned with producing objects of purely ceremonial or mystical use, for example carved god-sticks (attui whawhai), and "humara gods" (taumata) to serve as resting places for the gods (atua). Buck says that the Maori craftsman in selecting material and using particular techniques was primarily concerned with producing useful and necessary articles. With the introduction of coloured elements in plaiting, and carved patterns on objects of wood, bone, and stone, utility was not improved, but men derived pleasure from applying decoration to these useful objects, the results coming under the category of art.2i) (i) Curvilinear Elements in Maori Art. Maori art is predominantly curvilinear with considerable recti linear elements, the latter evident in such work as the decorative borders of some cloaks (taniko) and mat designs. Maori art with its curvilinear style is variant from the usual Polynesian decorative manner which is basically rectilinear and geometric in concept. This anomalous position continues to worry ethnologists. Skinner claimed that although Maori art in its most characteristic forms is native to New Zealand, some motifs are derived from Melanesia, where the human figure with two accompanying " bird-headed " manaia forms recurred constantly with innumerable variations as in Maori carving. For example the Melanesian love of scroll patterns in both carving and decorative painting could not be forgotten when reviewing Maori art. Polynesia on the other hand, with its perfection of execution, technical skill, and bias to symmetry and repetition contributed to similar characters in Maori art. Thus it is likely that the fusion of diverse Melanesian and Polynesian elements produced a fertile and vigorous native art which became further marked by new and dis tinctive characteristics of its own. In this way Skinner associated art development in New Zealand more closely with near Oceanic areas than any with any far-distant homeland.30 The theory that the curvilinear style once dominated Polynesia to be later lost by a process of degeneration, surviving only in marginal New Zealand lacks positive evidence, yet we must remember that curvi linear elements are present in most of the peripheral parts of Polynesia, for example in the Marquesas, Easter Island, and the Chatham Islands, in fact, in those areas most closely associated with New Zealand. Geo metric forms are not necessarily less accomplished or less artistic, although art with strong emotional content is usually associated with rhythmic organic curves. Buck suggests that certain archaic carvings such as the Kaitaia lintel31 and chevron type ornaments illustrate the rectilinear art which the ancestors of the Moa-hunter Maori brought to New Zealand with them from Central Polynesia.32 This view would 29 Buck 1949:302. 30 Skinner 1916 : Introduction. 31 For an illustration of this unique carving see J.P.S., 1921, Vol, 30:91, also Archey 1955. 32 Buck 1949:326-7.</page><page sequence="10">314 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY suggest local development of the curvilinear style which characterises the art of the later Maori. Such a solution however is too simple, particularly in face of facts, such as the parallel art motifs to be found throughout Oceania, and the strangely linked art areas within and with out Polynesia. However such a notable atuhority as Te Rangi Hiroa was prepared to state that, on present evidence, Maori curvilinear art appears to be a local development which was at its height at the time of first European contact. He agrees with Archey33 that Maori carving designs are best interpreted in terms of local development rather than ethnological associations.34 The whole story however is yet to be told. Serious research in this field will continue. No definite decisions can be made at this stage. (ii) Value of Diffusionist Studies in the Pacific: In spite of its curvilinear element Maori art is distinctly Polynesian in character. Also, like Melanesian and Micronesian art, Polynesian art conforms to a general Oceanic type; indeed, the whole Pacific Basin coastal areas would appear to be linked by cultural threads, some strong, some weak. Archaeological objects of great durability such as stone adzes maintain distinctive types, thus they lend themselves to classifica tion and systematic study better than the purely decorative arts. Here we enter the field of diffusionist studies. The work of Skinner and Duff35 is of special importance in this field, and the recent work of Aneli36 illustrates how realistic typological and diffusionist studies can be. In this instance Aneli takes for his central point the history of fishing in southern seas. Diffusionist studies in the field of art are not usually as successful as those in the field of systematic typology. Notable exceptions may be found, for instance in the work of Carl Schuster. Schuster took an element of simple art symbolism?joint marks?and traced their dis tribution in and around the Pacific.37 Likewise, Schuster took a similar art element?the V-shaped chest marking?plotting the distribution of this character from group to group throughout the Pacific world.38 Modern diffusionist studies of such a solid systematic and compre hensive type may some day solve many of the uncertainties regarding the origin and relationships of Maori art, for example it is possible the curvilinear element may ultimately be understood. Skinner observed that Polynesian culture is generally homogeneous, yet more varied in decorative art than in any other element?especially so in the case of the New Zealand Maori whose art at " first view " 33 Archey 1933:184. 34 Buck 1949:329. 35 Skinner and Duff make general reference to Bibliography. 36 Aneli 1955. 37 Schuster 1951. It must be admitted that studies of even this type are open to question. Such researches are, however, sure to further our knowledge when there is care and realistic association. 38 Schuster 1952:99-118. Schuster gives localities for these chest mark ings in Polynesia, i.e., Easter Island and Hawaii, but does not record this feature in New Zealand where it occurs frequently on, e.g., poutoko manawa figures,</page><page sequence="11">Maori Decorative Carving?An Outline 315 seemed to diverge markedly from the Polynesian norm.39 Archey views the relationship of Maori carving as clearly Polynesian.40 Ballantyne believed among other things, some fantastic, that the homogeneity of Maori art is astonishing, and that a severe geometrical base is the core of this homogeneity. Although there may be profound wisdom in this view, it is difficult to establish at this stage of our knowledge. Ballantyne also sees beneath Maori forms, " a maze of circles and equi lateral triangles " underlying the " tracery " of Maori art. " I believe," he says, " these carvings were laid out by men who were artistic geometers. By artistic geometry I mean the selection of forms which express the living structure of appearance in a manner at once deeply significant and harmonic."41 Special Figures and Symbols in Maori Art. The basic forms and symbols in Maori art are too numerous to describe in this essay. Only the more important symbols will be con sidered. An excellent series of sample patterns of Maori designs carved by Anaha Te Rahui, a masterly Arawa craftsman, have been figured with good photographs and descriptive notes by Phillipps.42 Anaha carved these specimen patterns in 1905 at the suggestion of Augustus Hamilton who secured them for the Dominion Museum.43 44 The more interesting figures and symbols that will now be con sidered are as follows: (i) the human form; (ii) hei tiki; (iii) manaia; (iv) the three fingered hand; (v) out-thrust tongue conven tion; (vi) the spiral; (vii) lizard form; (viii) the Marakihau; and finally sex symbolism in Maori art. (i) The Human Form: In Maori wood carving the human figure is the general art motif. With the exception of some ancestral forms45 no attempt was made to copy normal anatomic proportions. As this holds throughout Polynesia where carvers deliberately ignored anatomical proportions, it would appear conventional ideas of art must have early developed in which the human figure was treated conventionally and not realistically. Also, as most Polynesian carved human figures formed symbols of the gods (usually in the form of deified ancestors), it is possible that early craftsmen refrained from making their images too human in detail. What may have originated in the religious art of Central Polynesia was perpetuated in secular art in New Zealand. These are the reasons 39 Skinner 1923a:229-243. 40 Archey 1955:18. 41 Ballantyne 1930:39-40. 42 Phillipps 1941. 43 Anaha's " types " reprinted with other carving material in Maori Carving by W. J. Phillipps in 1949:7-21. 44 These may be seen in Development of Maori carving case at the Dominion Museum. 45 The centre support figures (poutoko manawa) in carved houses are good examples of this approach to naturalism.</page><page sequence="12">316 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY suggested by Buck.46 Naturalism in art, we must remember, is not the final criterion. If man is anything he is an artist, and with the exception of isolated periods (notably the Greek), his art history is characterized by symbolism and abstraction. It appears man has distorted natural forms deliberately to achieve greater vigour and design, avoiding the illusion of naturalism. What must not be forgotten is that the artist is rarely a comparative anatomist, and that the Maori artist is no exception. Throughout Oceania the stance of the human form is similar, that is (with some exceptions), standing, with flexed knees, with the arms also flexed and resting across the chest or abdomen, or occasionally pendant at the sides. In New Zealand and Easter Island one hand will, in some figures reach to the mouth or rest on the pubic region. A hand extending to the mouth is regular in New Zealand, a feature also to be seen in the Marquesas and Tahiti. Throughout Oceania standing figures characteristically hold a half-squatting stance. Archey has summarized the place of the human figure in Maori art which he says is an " art of the human figure, an art of statuary."47 (ii) Hei Tiki: The hei-tiki is one of the most striking products of Maori art, both artistically and technically. It is the best known of Maori art objects and has become something of a national symbol to the modern New Zealanders, both Maori and pakeha. This form however, has become encrusted with interpretations when in fact its origin is imperfectly understood. Strictly speaking " hei " means hanging?a pendant?and " tiki " refers to the Polynesian Adam, the first man to be created from the red clay of the earth by Tane. Sometimes Tiki is the actual creator of man; several accounts of Tiki appear in Maori traditions. Usually the tiki form is worked in New Zealand jade or related greenstones (pounamu is the general Maori term for nephrites, etc.), bone and stone being used rarely. Skinner suggests it unlikely that any precise significance attached to this " amulet " in pre-European times, and although it may have had some fertility association (the sex being usually feminine), tiki were also worn by men as we may see in the plates from the voyage of Captain James Cook and Dumont d'Urville. There is little foundation for one common belief that it represents the human embryo, the most agreed point is that through contact with people of prestige and power its mana increased and thus its value. Tiki do not appear to gain value from magic meaning, size or beauty.48 Tiki forms for suspension around the neck occur elsewhere in Poly nesia. Notable examples are the Marquesan bone specimens and the Easter Island wood figures, maoi miro, the Easter Island form bearing common features with the Maori hei-tiki, for example the ribs are 46 Buck 1949:307. 47 Archey 1955:3. 48 Skinner 1946:7-8.</page><page sequence="13">Maori D?corative Carving?An Outline 317 stressed, joint knobs at ankle and wrists are emphasized.40 Maori lapidary art reached its fullest achievement in jade hei-tiki, indeed it would not be an exaggeration to say that for technical skill and aesthetic merit Maori hei-tiki are unsurpassed in Oceania. For equal achieve ment in jade sculpture one must look to the sophisticated civilizations of South-East Asia where it is possible the Maori love for pounamu as a sacred substance has its origin. (iii) The Manaia: Firth speaks of " the mysterious manata, the bird-headed figure of unknown antecedents."5() This summarizes our knowledge of the most fascinating motif in Maori art, a motif that has caused endless con troversy. Adam calls the manata " a bird-headed animal or demon . . . combined with spiral patterns the manaias are reminiscent of garuda, the fabulous eagle of the Hindu pantheon, who is always represented holding two snakes in his claws " ; he continues to say however, that this resemblance is " undoubtedly accidental, as the origin and gradual development of manata arrangements have been thoroughly studied and proved indigenous to New Zealand."51 In a revised and enlarged edition of the same work Adam corrects this exaggeration by making a much milder and more correct statement. He writes : " However, some specialists in Maori art still think that the Manaia motive was developed in New Zealand."52 A widely accepted interpretation which won the approval of Te Rangi Hiroa53 is Archey's view that the manaia is of human origin, " fundamentally an anthropomorph developed from the conventionalized human figure with the face in profile, and that its evolution has proceeded as a natural development within the body of Maori art itself."54 One half of the Maori treatment of the full face in carving does with the " figure-of-eight mouth " present a remarkable beak-like, bird-man appearance. Avian origin is presented by Skinner55 in a manner equally convincing. Manaia figures have a decidedly avian appearance, an appearance that is strengthened by the claw-like hand which in place of a thumb bears a spur. The importance of the bird in Oceanic art is obvious from even superficial examination. Apart from the use of birds in ceremonies no evidence exists for a bird cult in New Zealand after the Easter Island pattern, but in nearby Chatham Islands something of a bird-cult may have existed for the bird is a motif of importance in the known art of this off-shore group so closely associated with New Zealand. In addition close parallels exist between Easter 49 ibid. 14. 50 Firth 1925:289. 51 Adams 1940:171. 7)2 Adams 1954:150.

Reference should be made to the plates and text of Skinner's Memoir.5,5 When Archey stated that the manata is a purely human figure or face in profile and not a bird-headed man he included as an argument against avian origin and the bird-man idea, " the almost universal presence of teeth, a distinctly non-avian character, in these elongated mouths."57 However, as the artist is rarely a comparative anatomist, he gives those creatures of his imagination any feature he wishes, indeed, the garuda bird-men of Indonesia do have teeth ; half-man, half-eagle, Garuda is the swift vehicle of the Hindu god Vishnu and is well armed with a ferocious set of teeth along his beak. Regardless of origin, whether mammalian, avian, or reptilian, the manaia like the spiral, was the Maori artist's stock-in-trade. Maori carving art and design employs this figure in endless com binations, occasionally with the beak element isolated, interlocked, or attenuated to fill-in areas of design. More than any other single motif the manaia expresses the ingenuity of the Maori carver. A knowledge of origins would give us satisfaction, yet we must not forget that the art of the Maori craftsman can be enjoyed without analysis. Although manaia origins may never be known with absolute certainty, it is likely that future studies will reveal the answers in an unexpected manner. The truth is, there has never been a thorough going systematic and comprehensive study of manaia. When this is made we may find some unusually positive results. Briefly, the view most likely to prevail is the avian hypothesis, for regardless of the human derivation theories of Archey (which are a distinct contribution to this field), the bird and bird-man idea in Maori decorative art are easily paralleled elsewhere in Oceania. The manaia bears so many distinctly avian characters, and so many non-human peculiarities, as well as a readiness to hybridize with human characters, that it is quite distinct from purely human representations. The manaia is most likely to prove a supernatural creature, a kind of atua or ancestor spirit, represented by a bird or hybrid bird-man. The subject calls for extensive research. (iv) The Three-fingered Hand:58 The three-fingered hand is typical of most Maori wood sculpture, although four and five-fingered hands do occur in some areas.59 Best 5G Skinner 1923b. 57 Archey 1936:49. 5S It is important to note that the conventional term " three-fingered hand " is a misnomer, and it is used here with reservations. Popular usage alone justifies the use of this term. Correctly, the typical manaia hand possesses three fingers, plus a fourth member, which might be called a " thumb," but it is more like a spur in appearance. The manaia hand so closely approximates the claw of a bird with inner, middle and outer hind toes that " claw-hand " would be a more appropriate term. 59 Phillipps 1941:10, mentions five-fingered hands in the Wairarapa on houses at Tahoraiti and Te Ore Ore, and on amo at Aotearoa Pa inland from Te Awamutu. Southward from this point to the Levin area most houses which date from the last century show the five-fingered hand.</page><page sequence="15">Maori Decorative Carving?An Outline 319 points out that although many " quaint ' reasons can be given, the fact is no Maori knows the origin of it any more than they can explain the manaia or other symbolical designs.60 Frequently the three-fingered hand has a decided bird-talon appearance, complete with spur, or as in North Auckland burial chests, the three-toed '(or clawed) feet are the webbed feet of a sea bird. From both manaia head and such a " bird claw " type of hand the bird-man idea receives strong support. Phillipps gives several accounts of the three-fingered hand from his own experience with informants, and from literary sources.61 A former Maori carver at the Dominion Museum, Mr. T. Heberley, believed that Tiki, the Polynesian Adam had three fingers. Tiki on being taunted showed what he could do in the way of carving human figures, all of which had three-fingered hands. Hare Hongi on the other hand, as a member of the Ngapuhi tribe said that the sacred rubbing stick (hika) used for generating fire was correctly held with three fingers, thus the three-fingered hand possessed a symbolic significance for the Maori. In another tradition from the East Coast, Hingangaroa was the first carver whose three sons, Taua, Mahaki, and Hauiti spread carving knowledge, the three fingers symbolizing the three sons. How ever, as Hingangaroa was a comparatively recent ancestor, this tradi tion, like many others, is a weak one. The so-called three-fingered hand of Maori carving antedated Hingangaroa by many centuries. After enquiries in the Urewera Professor Macmillan Brown maintained that the Maori found five fingers " too human." As ancestors represented in carving were gods, it was altogether too tapu to represent them in a naturalistic way. Graham suggested reptilian origin in the following story : " Pere tu had only three fingers ; this was not a deformity, but a sign of his descent from a reptile god ancestor. Thus it is that carved effigies of ancestors are shown with three fingers, as a tuhi (sign) that such were men of god-like descent, though they themselves may have hands like ordinary mortals." Cowan gives another story : " The first man of the Maori race to carve and decorate houses as we carve them today, was Nuku-wai-teko or Mutu-wai-teko, or, as some tribes have it, a man of Hawaiki. He had only three fingers on each hand, and this has been kept up even to this day by Maori carvers. This was in the very remote past when the ancestors of the Maori lived in the islands beyond the Moana-nui-a-Kiwa." Like the manaia form with which it is intimately related, the origin of the " three-fingered " hand may never be known with absolute certainty. In view of the evidence, however, it would appear to be a decided avian character. It is one of the characteristics that gives the manaia a decidedly bird-like appearance, being intimately related to the question of manaia origin, and manaia relationship, with the human figure. 60 Best 1924, Vol. 2, 574. 61 Phillipps 1941:8-9.

It is obviously a symbol of defiance and vigour appropriate to a war loving people like the ancient Maori. At childhood at least it is an almost universal way of expressing contempt, and appears in carving art where defiance seems most necessary, e.g., on defence stockade figures, canoe prows, carved gateways, tekoteko, koruru, and as a general feature of both the interior and exterior of meeting houses. The Te Hau ki Turanga house at the Dominion Museum is a good example of this, the tongues of figures being either in-set with a paua (Haliotis iris) eye, or the surface-carved with a wide variety of patterns. (vi) The Spiral: A special study of the spiral form in Maori art has been carried out by Phillipps who believes " they reveal to us a diversity of expression and a sense of rhythmic beauty peculiar to our Maori people." A remarkable number of spirals were created by Maori craftsmen. The most notable systematic series were carved by Mr. R. K. P. Porete, a Ngai Tahu Maori who carved forty-six spiral types in 1946 at the Dominion Museum under the direction of Mr. W. J. Phillipps.02 The diversity and unusual beauty of these spiral forms, particularly the double spiral type, ranks them as one of the finest achievements of the Maori artist as decorator. The spiral also imparts the essential curvi linear style to Maori carving in wood. Origins is again a problem. Modern Maori informants have appeared to rationalize on the spiral, possibly inventing likely stories out of politeness, to satisfy the inquisitive pakeha. Into such an un reliable class could we place the stories that, the first Maori craftsmen copied the unfolding fern-frond (pitau), the lizard's curled tail, coiled rope, and other spiral-like natural forms. Archey points out that this characteristic Maori carving pattern, notably the double or interlocking spiral, has been subject to as much discussion as the manaia, and presents his view that the double spiral is derived from loops formed by the interlocking of manaia mouths.03 This ingenious analysis is illustrated with positive examples by Archey. Another remarkable example of this development is seen in the bold sub-terminal gable-board decorations of pataka or food-storehouses where the jaws of highly stylized pakake (whale) loop to form simple double spirals. In presenting this view of spiral origins Archey supports the idea of local development for this element, as well as for manaia. If indeed Archey is correct in his analysis of art forms the problems of origin and development in Maori art have been greatly simplified, a simplifica tion that would demand a radical readjustment of art interpretation not only for New Zealand, but for the whole Oceanic area. However, 02 Phillipps 1948:30-40 and 1949:22-26.

Persistent evidence of common art influences appear, regardless of intervals of time and vast distances between island and island. The trail of South Sea arts will for this reason always be subtle, fascinating, and complex. (vii) The Lizard Form: Few animals are depicted in Maori art, and the native flora is absent. If the Maori did freely borrow symbols from nature at any stage of art development they have in time become so conventionalized they have lost resemblance to the originals. The lizard is the one exception, for it is depicted either in a naturalistic way, or in various degrees of stylization. The lizard is frequently in Maori wood carving, occurring rarely in bone and stone, or as painted motifs on the walls of limestone caves. Being a representative of Whiro, the personified form of death, the lizard possesses a magical significance which may account for its use in carving. Best explains the horror of the Maori folk for the lizard. To see a lizard was a serious omen, for it was the emissary of Whiro, therefore an harbinger of death and evil. The Maori believed that when the gods decided to destroy a man they introduced a lizard into his body to eat away his vitals.04 Downes65 in an interesting paper discusses Maori mentality regarding the lizard and taniwha in the Whanganui region, an account which emphasizes the force of such beliefs in determining mentality, and it might be added, the develop ment of expressive art. The lizard as an art motif is important in other parts of Polynesia, for example, the lizard carvings of Easter Island are well known. On the western boarder of Polynesia the lizard appears among the ideo graphs of Tongan clubs, while in Central Polynesia Marquesan art which possesses remarkable New Zealand parallels, presents an abund ance of lizard forms on stilt-steps, carved clubs, and as decorative lashings.67 Throughout Polynesia the lizard appears to be the personi fication of evil, destruction, and death, possessing a similar position to the snake in Western culture. At the primitive level however, such associations have power. In the case of the South Sea folk the origin of this association of the lizard with evil is frequently given as a folk memory of the crocodile. Indonesian ancestors had reason to fear this terrible animal which was to them a constant source of danger. Best confirms this view with the remarkable adjoiner that the Maori himself asserts it, pointing out that the saurian-like taniwha of Maori myth indicates a former knowledge of crocodiles.6S Indeed, descriptions of the taniwha in folk-tales from all parts of New Zealand suggests a vague memory of the crocodile.

Skinner09 in various papers had pointed out these motifs in Oceanic art, particularly where the combination of bird and snake occurs.70 (viii) The Marakihau: The marakihau is the last separate symbol to be treated. " What ever its original significance," said Buck, " the figure has come to be regarded as a fabulous sea monster."71 This fabulous sea-monster with semi-human head, fish-like tail, and tube- or sucker-like tongue (ngongo), was said to swallow seafarers and canoes whole. Such marakihau Best records, were believed to be in some cases an ancestor transformed into such a form after death. As examples are seldom wanting, Best was able to quote the case of one Te Tahi-o-te-rangi, a member of the Ngati-Awa tribe of Whakatane who is said to have become a marakihau.12 This ancestor idea of marakihau may account for their fairly frequent use in house interiors as pou pou, that is the carved ancestral panels. Archey traces the development of marakihau, stating that: " Like the manaia, the marakihau would therefore seem to have originally been a normal human figure, and to have reached its present form by modification of its ordinary human features; but whatever its evolution may have been, it seems that to the Maori mind it is now a marine creature, for it is usually depicted as catching fish by means of an elongated filiform tongue."73 (ix) Phallic Symbolism in Maori Art: Maori art may be classed as moderately phallic because of the obvious symbols, and because the sexual organs appear to have been venerated in the religious system of the Maori as symbolizing the generative powers of nature. However, Buck wisely cautions against regarding certain material objects and observances as evidence of the former existence of phallic worship, before enquiring into Maori cultural norms towards sex and reproduction, which were in fact remarkably free and honest. In a society where leadership was based on male succession, heirs were vital, therefore barren women resorted to the fertilizing powers in trees, rocks and other agencies, but Buck could not see that any of these practices were connected with the abnormal worship of the phallus which existed in some ancient civilizations. He is well worth quoting at length : " Frequent references to the sex organs occur in myths, legends, and chants. The male organ was referred to as tawhito (ancient one) in sacerdotal chants, and the term tiki was used to denote the procreating organ of Tane in the human creation myths. The male organ was figuratively regarded as the symbol 09 General reference may be made to Bibliography. 70 An excellent exhibit on this theme with illustrative material from New Zealand and Melanesia may be seen in the Otago Museum, Dunedin. 71 Buck 1949:313. 72 Best 1923:322. 73 Archey 1935:178.</page><page sequence="19">Maori D?corative Carving?An Outline 323 of virility and courage . . . The concept that the penis was the symbol of virility and life is also indicated by the following ritual to ward off a suspected attack by a sorcerer. The person who suspected such an attack held his penis and recited the following karakia :? The attack was thus diverted towards a guarded part of the body, and it may be assumed that confidence in the protective ritual made the attack abortive. The female organ has also attracted much figurative attention. Man's divine or spiritual essence was derived from the male element, as personified by Tane, and his material part, which dies, came down from the female element, as personified by Hineahuone, the first woman made of earth. It was the female organ of Hinenuitepo which strangled Maui on his quest for immortality and so brought death into the world. In sex matters, it is the female organ which figuratively kills its male antagonist. Hence the female organ was referred to as ' te whare o Aitu' (the house of death). However, references to sex matters, whether in the figurative language of the classics or in ordinary con versation were considered normal and hence were devoid of that coarseness and vulgarity which seems inseparable when expressed in English."74 Buck further remarks that the frequent occurrence of the sex organs in carving is because the human body is the common motif in Maori art. " It is curious," he says, " how they (the sex organs in Maori carvings are treated with suspicion by the general public which accepts as natural the similar treatment of marble statues. If, in some carvings, the carver has made the phallus unusually large, the suspicion becomes a conviction unless it is realized that the artist was influenced by a bizarre sense of humour. Maori art is profane and not religious."75 In view of this can we call Maori art phallic? However, a more serious aspect must be studied in the future. Phallic symbolism in Maori art is more than the secular humour of carvers. To date serious study of this sexual aspect of Maori carving has been avoided, whether from a mistaken respect for decency, or for fear of entering the field of porno graphy it is difficult to determine. The innate prudishness of Western culture where primitive arts are concerned has reached strange limits. Early collections of Maori carvings were expurgated with hammer and chisel, kilt and sporran make respectable today carvings that escaped emasculation by well meaning, if prudish, Europeans. What would the ancient carver think of the pakeha acting thus ? It would mystify him. Would he ask, " Is this the last pakeha plan to destroy my ancient mana for ever?"

The vigorous climate of New Zealand, with its rich supply of fine timber and stone, stimulated the Polynesian migrants to new efforts in both woodwork, and the stone implements for working the massive timbers of a new environment. Carvers embarked on a course of development, possible only in the geographical environment of New Zealand, that was to culminate in the most spectacular wood-carving art in Polynesia. As carving developed, from what must have been a Central Polynesian type of art, different schools of carving arose in different districts, all using the human figure as the chief motif. The original religious symbolism of Central Polynesia however, became in New Zealand the secular motifs in Maori art.7,; Although Maori spiritual and material culture remained essentially Polynesian, the effect of a new geographical environment transformed Maori culture to the most deviant form in Polynesia. The Maori genius for adaption and experiment resulted in a wide variety of new art styles, stimulated by the exciting opportunities offered by this new environment. The earliest stages of development are suggested by a few archaic carvings, but these are not in sufficient number, or not sufficiently studied, for reliable or conclusive analyses.77 These odd archaic carvings testify to the tropical Polynesian character of the first New Zealand art, and at first view appear remote from the later curvilinear art, the trend to a kind of Oceanic " rococo " surface decoration, imposed on old Polynesian forms, e.g., the human figure stylized in a distinct way. With this new art there developed art areas each with a special style and its own characters. Skinner defines eight such areas (including the Chatham Islands), with valuable notes on each.78 The breakdown of carving schools in the North Island occurred after the advent of the pakeha, for example, disintegration was particularly marked in Taranaki and North Auck land. The death of art in some areas is pointed out by McEwen79 who lists as a tentative suggestion the fairly well defined culture areas of North Auckland, Hauraki, Te Arawa, Matatua, Taranaki, and Whanganui. Carving at Rotorua flourished before and after the coming of the pakeha, its survival being both fortunate and unfortunate. Rotorua is now synonymous with Maori carving in the popular mind, and tends to serve as the yardstick to measure all carving. In so far as Rotorua carving is accepted as a final criterion, it is a false standard, for those art areas which may be justly called the most vigorous, for example, Taranaki and North Auckland, were among the first to expire. Again, the glories of South Island wood-carving art, the art of the Moa-hunter and his kin, must be left virtually to the imagination. The magnificent range and wealth of stone tools found in the South Island, 76 Buck, 311-2. 77 The Kaitaia carving in the Auckland Museum (see footnote 31). Archaism in Maori art is one of the most fascinating topics in this field, however it is involved beyond the scope of this outline essay. 78 Skinner 1921:71-78. 79 McEwen 1947:175-6,</page><page sequence="21">Maori Decorative Carving?An Outline 325 particularly within the Murihiku region, suggest an accomplished wood art. This does not necessarily imply, however, that there existed an accomplished decorative art. Probably ornament was simple and direct, using the human figure as the central motif, lacking surface decoration, and in many ways approximating the style of Central Polynesian work. Surface decoration was most likely restrained. We may be certain that at first glance it would have appeared quite foreign to the North Island curvilinear style, and remote from the modern Rotorua manner. The establishment of the Rotorua School of Maori Arts and Crafts and the revival of Maori arts under the inspired leadership of the great Maori, Sir Apirana Ngata, gave an impetus to modern Maori art. However, this revival was more social in its aims than artistic, and naturally its aesthetic standards were not and could not be those of the pre-pakeha Maori who worked under an ancient social and religious system. We must be careful not to confuse the art of ancient and modern. Both are expressions of Maori art, but expressions with a difference. (i) Taranaki Carving: Houston, in pointing out that Taranaki is a particularly rich area for swamp-preserved stone-age art of a distinct kind, advises against any attempt to divide the country into " water-tight " compartments, for example he says, " something of the North Auckland type was carried to Taranaki by elements of the Ngati Awa tribe of the Northern peninsula." Houston in his paper recognizes that little steel work was carried out in Taranaki, that the carving of this area exhibited a life, vigour and grace, was " not profusely ornamental, leaving freedom from the impression of over ornamentation." Also typical were wide pointed heads, linking of arms, legs and bodies, the passing of arms through mouths, or leg through the eye of an adjoining figure, crescent like pointed hands and feet, deep-cut relief and variations of mata kupenga (the meshes of the fisherman's net design).80 Sex symbolism in Taranaki carving is marked. Mouths frequently become female gentalia, and female figures on door lintels (pare) usually draw back their thighs to expose the vulva. These stark features have given Taranaki carvers a bad reputation, and it has been suggested that such items of Maori art were made to order for sailormen with debased taste, but this explanation is out of the question (for Taranaki at least), because the art we are considering is pre-European. Taranaki swamps have yielded masterpieces of carving art. Hine-i-te-huhi the Maori " Maiden of the Swamps," was always prepared to safeguard sacred carvings when war parties invaded the land, or when other dangers arose, even if the owners could never return for them. Speaking of the splendid collection of swamp-preserved Taranaki carvings at the Dominion Museum, Phillipps who is a regular con tributor on Maori art, speaks of them as revealing " the unexpected to a degree amazing even in the realm of Maori carving, for inside this 80 Houston 1948:302-3.</page><page sequence="22">326 JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY curvilinear and rhythmic art, they stand out as a class apart in the extremity of distortion achieved.,, Phillipps also indicates that the head in the Taranaki style is usually pointed, the body ridged longitudinally, that figures on some pare number five, the central figure being most human, the others becoming less so as they progress towards the terminating manaia forms. Phillipps also records that an old Bay of Plenty carver told him (through an interpreter) that the central figure of such pare was a man, an either side were the man's two ghosts, a wairua and kohua as separate spirits.81 (ii) East Coast Carving: Another carving area of special interest is the East Coast. The style is distinct, and a great quantity of good carving from that area has been preserved. Another feature is, like the Te Arawa, East Coast carving art flourished in the pakeha era. The best single example of large work from the area is the Tehau-ki-Turanga carved house now to be seen at the Dominion Museum. Phillipps in a description of this whare whakairo considers that it " embodies all that is best in the traditional East Coast carving." This house was built by members of the Ngatikaipoho tribe at Turanga as a monument to the chieftain Tamata Waaka Tuangere. Eighteen carvers using steel tools started the house in October of 1842, and finished in March of 1843,82 a remark able achievement for six months work. Another account of two splendid interior house carvings from the East Coast now in the Dominion Museum which embody the East Coast features have recently been described by Phillipps.83 Complexity of design with abundant surface decoration seen in these slabs is typical. Further information on carved houses in the eastern districts of the North Island may be found by reference to the same author.84 Phillipps was responsible for much analytical work relating to the details of carving technique, and further references may be found in the Bibliography. The Impact of European Culture on Maori Art. The effects of culture contact with Europeans was disastrous to the truly ancient arts of the New Zealand Maori. The old order quickly changed as the neolithic Maori artisan found iron and steel tools in his hands. Such tools had an intoxicating effect, and thus, under a chang ing social order with new beliefs, new economic life and values, the old traditional restraints broke down, resulting in a degeneration of both taste and skill. This however is a purist view. It is true that from about the middle of the 19th century to the turn of the 20th century good carving was executed, but it is Maori carving with a difference. New Zealand is one of the few places in the world where old indigenous art, in this case primitive art, has been transposed to 81 Phillipps 1939. 82 Phillipps 1940. 83 Phillipps 1954:255-7. s* Phillipps 1944.</page><page sequence="23">Maori Decorative Carving?An Outline 327 modern needs, a fact recognised by Leenhardt.85 Some Maori arts have been preserved in the modern world to meet social purposes, for example the carved meeting house still serves as a focal point and symbol for Maori communities whose members in their everyday life may use tele phones, electricity, drive cars, and think in ways more akin to the pakeha than to their Maori ancestors. The preservation of other arts such as song and dance, the traditional working of flax skirts (piupiu), for concerts and ceremonial occasions, makes for respect and confidence. Arts such as tattoo and the drying of heads are of course out-moded by the social requirements of the day. Any traditional art that meets a modern need is right and proper ; what must not be confused is a modern expression with an ancient one. The aims in each case are different. Old Maori art which dates from the pre-pakeha era, or from the earliest period of European contact is characterized by vigour and originality. Tradition in early carving art is strong, but with that tradition there is also originality and resiliance that bear little relation to later work which is all too frequently stereotyped in design, and worse, covered with obtrusive surface decoration which obliterates any feeling for form that might have existed. In early work on the other hand, including the best steel tool work, surface decoration remains subservient to form enhancing the blocked out masses of sculptured wood. Mere demonstration of chisel virtuosity was avoided by ancient Maori craftsmen who worked religiously under disciplined training, with the approving (or disapproving) eye of an interested society. Dilettante smatters did not exist. Carving was a serious business. Mistakes could bring the vengeance of the gods. Archey points out that the deterioration in Maori carving was partly the result of breakdown in the influence of the tohunga or priestly experts, the lessening of old authority, and the entrance into the craft unauthorised tyros who naturally missed the vital tradi tional training in old patterns, a view he had confirmed by Sir Apirana Ngata.8fi However, when we speak of " deterioration," criteria of assessing aesthetic merit are implied. The quality of this early work which is distinguished by a certain harmony and balance, cannot be defined objectively. Fullest appreciation or judgement of Maori art can be gained only by approaching objects aesthetically, observing technical skill, and tying objects to a social context too, but firstly applying trained intuitive judgement which is best developed by direct association with Maori art. Such a method of intuitive evaluation would no doubt horrify scientists generally, but aesthetics or that aspect of philosophy which deals with the beautiful is not science. The created products of man's imagination are best judged by the same imagination and intuition, backed of course, by a general knowledge of the culture concerned. Conflict of opinion there must be, even among experts, yet agreement is far too regular to condemn this method of assessing the relative value of Maori art objects. Dogmatism must be avoided at all times.

A good standard of judgement where Maori art is concerned may be obtained from study of those collections made in England, America, and Europe from material brought home by explorers, whalers, missionaries, sailors, and adventurers generally. Notable examples are the Oldman Collection which is now owned by the New Zealand Government,87 the Webster,88 Fuller, and Hooper89 collections in London, and the Peabody Museum collection at Salem,90 Massachusetts, U.S.A. The Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology Maori collections, the British Museum collection, and the Andreas Reischek collection in Vienna, give us other good examples. The standard is uniformly high. Another question in considering Maori carving is whether the work was done with stone or steel tools. Iron or steel tools were available in increasing quantities from 1769, the time of Captain James Cook's first visit in the bark Endeavour. Can we then determine with accuracy what tools wTere used ? McEwen tried to discover by practical experi ment whether we are right in believing limitations were imposed on the ancient Maori carver because he lacked steel tools. As he was him self a skilled carver, McEwen cut two wheku type heads, one using greenstone chisels, and the other using a primitive-type steel chisel formed from a large flat nail. After experiment McEwen was satisfied that any type of carving done with steel chisels can be done almost as well with greenstone tools, although with the latter, more time is con sumed. Ridges in the steel cut specimen have sharper edges as one would expect, although there was no cutting mark in either wheku head to indicate which tool was used. McEwen's conclusion was there fore, that there is no certain method of determining by examination whether a carving was done with stone tools or with primitive steel tools.91 Common sense is necessary here as elsewhere, and this con clusion is not to be taken that we can never tell the difference. Some carvings are distinctly stone tool, while others are distinctly steel cut. It is traditional, border-line cases that cause some head-scratching. McEwen's experiment was both remarkable and valuable. However, the earliest iron or steel tools were prepared by men skilled in their old techniques of sharpening, etc. We must not imagine we can fully re-create these conditions for the sake of experiment. No doubt well sharpened nephrite and other stone tools in skilled hands sent the shavings flying in a manner that would now amaze us, for as McEwen's 87 Oldman 1938. This collection was distributed among New Zealand Museums in 1950, the major part of the Maori collection however remained at the Dominion Museum. 88 Webster 1948, describes 129 items of Maori jade. Mr. Webster is a New Zealander resident in London, who has collected a remarkable range of fine old Maori material, part of which is deposited at the Dominion Museum, Wellington. Mr. Webster has been instrumental in returning to its native land many excellent examples of Maori art. 89 Hooper and Burland 1953. 90 Dodge 1941. 91 McEwen 1946:111-5.

Modern Maori carving falls into a third class of work which employs well forged and tempered steel chisels of varied type, as far removed from the makeshift spike-nail " chisels " as the spike-nail is from the stone. The Dominion Museum's fine Te Hau ki Turanga whare whakairo carved in 1842 is an example of this third class of work. The carvers of this house were in contact with pakeha carpenters, shipwrights, and the settled towns of New Zealand, The new tools which allowed such clean quick cutting did not overcome their innate sense of craftsmanship in this case. The restraints of a great art are there present. According to Buck, carving art probably reached its peak about the time of European contact.92 The early voyagers from James Cook on were impressed by the wood carving of New Zealand, for presumably in the eighteenth and early nineteenth century it had reached a great flowering, an efflorescence that was not repeated. Where carving art would have developed had the subsequent European invasion not taken place we can only guess. We know the Maori as a Polynesian was ever inventive, ever ready to drop an out-moded idea for the sake of a new one, just as he discarded his stone toki for the steel adze. In view of this characteristic, without pakeha contact, it is unlikely decadence would have appeared in Maori arts. The known facts suggest develop ment would have occurred along more diverse and accomplished lines. The advent of the pakeha, however, cut short the art of the neolithic Maori, but opened up new modes of thought which have taken him with a leap into the modern world of Western culture. Thus an old proverb says:? Ka pu te ruha The old net is laid aside ; Ka hao te rangatahi A new net goes afishing.9 5 BIBLIOGRAPHY Adam, L., 1940. Primitive Art. Penguin Books, England. See Chap.
