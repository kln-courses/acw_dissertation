From a  life of dissipation and promiscuous love affairs in  Venice (1817-19), Byron was rescued by Teresa,  Countess Guiccioli, a woman of cultivated tastes  who became his mistress. In this Italian period he  finished Childe Harold and among other writings  produced the drama Manfred (1817), Beppo (1818)  and A Vision of Judgement (1822).

Byron’s interest  in the cause of freeing Greece from Turkish rule led  him to join the liberation committee in 1823. He set  out for Greece later in the year; the following April  he died of fever at Missolonghi. For much of the  19th century he was regarded as the epitome of the  romantic hero, a noble, melancholy wanderer and  a passionate lover of freedom, but this judgement,  based on his early poems, is largely the creation of  his admirers (and in some moods of himself). The  truer Byron, repressed in youth and always aware  of his deformity, was much more of a satirist in the  tradition of *Voltaire, an ironical realist as little  blind to his own failings as to those of others, as  aware of the savagery, squalor and tedium of life as  of its beauty and glory.
