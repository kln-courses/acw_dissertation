<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philosophy and Phenomenological Research Vol. XLIII, No. 4, June I983 Hume's Dialectical Conceits: The Case of Dialogue XII DENNIS ROHATYN University of San Diego A graduate school professor of mine once wrote on the margin of one of my papers that while it was- good, it was filled with "dialectical con- ceits." By this, he meant clever remarks that tended to focus attention on myself as the author rather than on the subject-matter. (He was right, incidentally). I cannot help getting this feeling whenever I read Hume's twelfth Dialogue. Part of my purpose in writing this paper is to expose and share with you some of what I take to be Hume's dialectical conceits, in that part of his work. But I must confess at the outset that there is a problem about making this accusation. For, as far as I can tell, no one has ever remarked on the presence of these conceits in Hume. This means either that Hume did a poor job of focusing attention on himself - a distinct possibility, in view of what he relates concerning Treatise in "My Own Life" - or else that my hypothesis is wrong. I shall try to show that there is a third possibility before my paper is done, but I must not get ahead of my own story. Accordingly, I shall divide my narrative into three parts. Part I will detail the conceits them- selves. Part II will offer an explanation of their presence. Part III will attempt to account for their neglect. I Most, but not all, of the clevernesses to which I want to call your atten- tion occur in the last two pages of Hume's text. We might begin with Philo's remark that if God (the "Divine Being") were understood rightly, some of our misconceptions concerning his attitude toward human beings ("his own workmanship") would disappear. Philo goes on to say: Nor would any of human race merit his favor but a very few, the philosophical theists, who entertain or rather indeed endeavor to entertain suitable notions of his divine perfec- tions. As the only persons entitled to his compassion and indulgence would be the philo- sophical sceptics, a sect almost equally rare, who, from a natural diffidence of their own capacity, suspend or endeavor to suspend all judgment with regard to such sublime and HUME'S DIALECTICAL CONCEITS 519</page><page sequence="2">such extraordinary subjects. (i zz)' Stripped of its pretensions, the cash-value of this passage is: "Cleanthes, if anybody is going to (be rewarded in) heaven, it is you and I." A few pages earlier (ii6), commenting on Cleanthes' view that the conception of a "future state" is needed as a guarantee on morals, Philo had already observed that . . .philosophers, who cultivate reason and reflection, stand less in need of such motives to keep them under the restraint of morals;. . . the vulgar, who alone may need them, are utterly incapable of so pure a religion as represents the Deity to be pleased with nothing but virtue in human behavior. This, too, is a highly arrogant remark. Much of Dialogue XII is con- cerned to show that theological beliefs do not improve character or edify politics. But it is one thing to contrast theology with common sense; another, to suggest that philosophical beliefs are superior to theo- logical ones, and philosophers superior to common sense folk. It is not even in keeping with Hume's sarcasm in Treatise, which contrasts "superstition" with metaphysical speculation and concludes that "generally speaking, the errors in religion are dangerous; those in phi- losophy only ridiculous."' Virtually all of Hume's Dialogues consists in critique, if not ridicule, of traditional philosophical arguments of one sort or another. Why then has Philo seen fit to contend that philoso- phers form an elite group whose eternal bliss is somehow more assured than that of "the vulgar"? This sentiment is more in keeping with Pla- to's thoughts concerning philosopher-kings in their contemplative moments, than it is with empiricism and skepticism.3 Of course, it could be that Philo is merely recommending the virtue of Socratic inquiry as a way of life, and contrasting it with the unreflective habits of others.4 But even this emphasis on the process of thought rather than its All page references in parentheses and all quotes not otherwise acknowledged in the text are taken from David Hume, Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, edited by Nelson Pike (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, I970).

"True religion," Philo avers, is at all times ahistorical, i.e., ". . . always confined to very few persons" (i i8). Cleanthes urges Philo not to let ". . . your zeal against false religion to undermine your veneration for the true" (ii9), showing that both men support this distinction. Unlike Plato, there is no discussion of the philosopher's obli- gation to lead the vulgar out of darkness. "The vulgar," Philo holds, ". . . who are unacquainted with science and profound inquiry, observing the endless disputes of the learned, have commonly a thorough con- tempt for philosophy . . ." (8). This very early passage may bear traces of bitterness, but it can also be read as implying that the vulgar very justly draw their conclusions about philosophy from the bad example that it often sets. And yet, is it a bad example? Philo goes on to remark that there are "contradictions" which inhere in the concepts of matter, causality, extension, space, time, motion, and quantity (8); if so, then debates 52O DENNIS ROHATYN</page><page sequence="3">product is insufficient to justify the crass class-bias displayed in the pas- sages just quoted. To be sure, Hume was socially conservative,5 but his conservativism was not rooted in any convictions about the superiority of philosophers as a group, except when compared, say, with the clergy. What I want to contend is not that there is an inconsistency between early and late Hume, but rather that they have something in common: the attempt to "excite a murmur among the zealots,"6 and that this failed in one instance as it did in the other. This is one reason why pas- sages such as the ones just quoted count as paradigm cases of "conceit." There is another, which I must withhold until Part II. A second case of conceit occurs in the next to last paragraph of the book. There Philo remarks that anyone who really comprehends the limitations of our reason ". . . will fly to revealed truth with the great- est avidity . . ." and proceeds to make the following claim: "to be a philosophical skeptic is, in a man of letters, the first and most essential step towards being a sound, believing Christian . . ." (Iz3). The prob- lem I have with this statement is that it is too easy to cerebralize it, that is, to relate it to men and movements in Western thought, including those on whom this comment exerted some influence (Hamann, Kier- kegaard). The reinforcement of fideism is also the whole point of Occam's nominalism, and as Occam is the inaugurator of an entire tra- dition of which Hume is one of the heirs, the statement has a logical ring to it. But can anyone take seriously Philo's claim that refuge in rev- elation is the logical consequence of skepticism? By "take seriously" I mean, can anyone imagine Philo doing this? By making skepticism a precondition for Christian belief, Philo is in effect doing two things: (i) challenging the Christian to undergo a complete, if temporary, reversal of attitude and mental habit; (ii) setting himself up as the arbiter, nay exemplar, of sound religious practice. "If anyone is a Christian, it is I" is the cash-value of this idea. Again, an invitation to anger or else laugh- ter, on the part of the reader, suggests itself as a reason why Hume would make a controversial, counterintuitive, and potentially offensive verbal gesture of this kind. We could of course soften it, by reinterpret- ing Philo as holding that skepticism is only a necessary condition for true faith, not a sufficient condition. But this is only a verbal dodge, and about the proper interpretation of these concepts must be continuous, and their failure to become conclusive must be endemic to the subject-matter, even if this occasions pardonable (?) irritation on the part of those who are not especially trained in it. If I were cast in the role of Philo, I would want by my gesture and tone of voice to empha- size that philosophy is indispensable to every form of thought, even though it settles no disputes and bakes no bread. But I would not want to create the impression of down- grading those who fail to understand or see this. Yet I cannot rule this out as a dra- matic possibility, either. John B. Stewart, The Moral and Pdlitical Philosophy of David Hume (New York: Columbia University Press, i963), is still definitive on this subject. 6 David Hume, "My Own Life," reprinted in Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, edited by Norman Kemp Smith (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, i96z), 234. HUME S DIALECTICAL CONCEITS 5ZI</page><page sequence="4">(verbally) no less pretentious than Hume's original. Since Philo is the model of a true skeptic, and there are no Christian skeptics around, or at least none who have passed through Philo's trial by logical fire, the cashing-in amounts to this: "There are no true Christians, but I am closer to being one than anybody else." And that does not differ very much from what we stated as the unsoftened version of Philo's remarks. We have to remember, too, that the Dialogues offer us a representative of revealed religion - Demea - whose reasoning powers are so mini- mal that his arguments for God's existence are disposed of by Cleanthes, not by Philo.7 Demea, though by now absent from the dis- cussion, is alluded to in the course of the same passage just examined, as a "haughty dogmatist" who uses philosophy uncritically and without an awareness of the limits of reason.8 For these reasons, despite the impact which Hume's views had on romantic and existential religious movements, I cannot believe that he meant what he was saying. Or rather, he did mean it, as yet another way of twitting his adversaries, of trying to get a "rise" out of them, and of arguing for the superiority of his own methodology and temperament. Two other cases of conceit arise in the final section of Hume's work.9 One is right at the beginning, when Philo avers that he is entitled to be frank on the subject of natural religion . . .both because I know that I can never . . . corrupt the principles of any man of common sense and because no one . . . in whose eyes I appear a man of common sense will ever mistake my intentions (107-8). The first part of this is ambiguous. Does Philo mean that his views are merely theoretical doubts, which cannot affect the plain religious decency of the ordinary person? Or is it a jibe at the just-departed Demea, who is both "corrupt" (in the sense of irrational) and (conse- quently) not a man of common sense at all, and whose huffy departure brought about a remonstration by Cleanthes concerning Philo's lack of tact, to which Philo is here responding, with an evident "not guilty" plea? Philo's self-defense can be turned into a piece of callousness coupled with rational self-righteousness: "do not blame me if his (or anyone's) world-view falls apart; I just lay out the facts and analyze the arguments, and call them as I see them" is one, admittedly unflattering, way of translating his words. The second part is equally ambiguous, and for much the same reason: if no man of common sense will misin- terpret him, why has Cleanthes (a) failed to understand, follow, or 7 Dialogue IX, 75-77. This is in keeping with Cleanthes' empiricism; Demea's argu- ments are all strictly rationalist, and Cleanthes is a latter-day Aquinas attacking Anselm. Also, this provides some dramatic relief from the burden of Philo's role. 8 Dialogue XII, I13. These limits are exactly the ones already alluded to as "contradictions" at I, 8. 9 I am not arguing that conceits cannot be found earlier; I am merely confining myself to a survey of those to be encountered in XII. 522 DENNIS ROHATYN</page><page sequence="5">accept Philo's objections to various versions of the design argument (b) raised a scruple about Philo's treatment of Demea? Or is Philo saying, between the lines, that Cleanthes lacks common sense? In that case, perhaps we should reevaluate the comment on izz: maybe it is only Philo who is going to gain admission to heaven; perhaps the inclusion of Cleanthes was for diplomacy's sake. If, as Iz3 maintains, only the skeptics have a chance for election (assuming for a moment that belief is a prerequisite for salvation - by no means an orthodox tenet of the Calvinism with which Hume was familiar), then only Philo, not Cleanthes, can be saved. So perhaps the riposte at 107-8 is just that, a piece of raillery disguised as innocence. "Who, me?" Philo is saying - "I, a corrupter of common sense? How could I be one, when I am the only person in this discussion who exhibits any?"'0 A last case of conceit occurs at i i z, where Philo states flatly that the atheist ". . . is only nominally so and can never possibly be in ear- nest . . ." Boswell found out differently, if his deathbed interview with Hume be consulted." Moreover, the comment which immediately fol- lows this, in which Hume declares that there is "a certain degree of analogy among all the operations of nature" is anything but a conces- sion to the proponent of design. On the contrary, it is if anything a bril- liant anticipation of later developments in physics, chemistry, and biol- ogy which bear out, wholly within a naturalistic framework, the resemblance which Hume claims between "the rotting of a turnip, the generation of an animal, and the structure of human thought" (iiz). The same may be said of his later, italicized remark granting a "remote analogy" between human intelligence and the "causes of order in the universe" (izz). This goes no further than Einstein's well-known com- ment about God being cunning but not evil.,' Reverting to I12, my impression is that Hume is protesting too much; that Philo is denying the obvious, again perhaps for the sake of diplomacy. None of this is out of character for Hume, who as Strawson has rightly remarked is the ironist of philosophy.I3 But it is important for us to become aware of "An 'ethical' conviction which is dissolved by the psychological 'understanding' of other values is about as valuable as religious beliefs which are destroyed by scientific knowledge, which is of course a quite frequent occurrence" (Max Weber, in Max Weber on the Methodology of the Social Sciences, translated by Edward A. Shils and Henry A. Finch [Glencoe, II.: Free Press, I949], I4). I take it what both Weber and Philo are saying is "if it (the crumbling of your world-view thanks to my influence) happens, it must have deserved to happen," i.e., your world-view must not have been worth much to begin with - a harsh, but not necessarily arrogant, assessment. James Boswell, "An Account of my last interview with David Hume, Esq.," reprinted in Kemp Smith's edition of Dialogues, op. cit., 76-79. "The true conclusion is that the original source of all things is entirely indifferent to all these principles . . . we have no more reason to infer that the rectitude of the Supreme Being resembles human rectitude than that his benevolence resembles the human" (Philo, at XI, I04). 13 See the-Introduction to P. F. Strawson, Individuals (London: Methuen, I959), 9. HUME S DIALECTICAL CONCEITS 5Z3</page><page sequence="6">Hume's use of irony as a dramatist, in order to assess its point. To that enterprise I now turn. II I shall make my cards plain. I believe that the single most important event in Hume's Dialogues is not something that occurs in XII but immediately preceding it - Demea's finding a pretext, at the end of XI, to leave (io6). What Pamphilus told us about Demea's "rigid inflexible orthodoxy" (5) might have led us to expect something like this from the beginning. But its occurrence leaves us with a dialogue instead of a tria- logue. It also allows us to ponder the following lessons which Hume may be trying to impart: (a) it is not of ultimate importance whether God does or does not exist, whether his existence can or cannot be proved, or whether philosophy is adequate to the latter task. What is important is that human beings go on communicating to one another, that they be willing to critique one another and not withdraw from the arena of discussion. Pamphilus refers to ". . . the two greatest and purest pleasures of human life - study and society" (4), and this is cer- tainly consistent with remarks Hume makes about the pleasures afforded by philosophy (and intellectual companionship) in Treatise.I4 But pleasure and friendship - Philo refers to the "unreserved intimacy" (whatever that means) of his relationship with Cleanthes, at io8 - are one thing, commitment to conversation is another. Back in Part IV, Cleanthes became altogether unnerved by the force of some Philonian criticism. Consequently he retreated, momentarily, to the following piece of obscurantism: The order and arrangement of nature, the curious adjustment of final causes, the plain use and intention of every part and organ - all these bespeak in the clearest language an intel- ligent cause or author. The heavens and the earth join in the same testimony: The whole chorus of nature raises one hymn to the praises of its Creator. You alone, or almost alone, disturb this general harmony. You start abstruse doubts, cavils, and objections; you ask me what is the cause of this cause? I know not; I care not; that concerns not me. I have found a Deity; and here I stop my inquiry. (46) Philo has no difficulty parrying this thrust. But it is to Cleanthes' credit that he does not stop his inquiry, but continues to persevere, both in his 14 Treatise, op. cit., I, iv, 7, 27I. "Pleasure and satisfaction" are alluded to at I, ii, but what is more noteworthy is that Philo goes on to say that ". . . everyone, even in common life, is constrained to have more or less . . . philosophy; . . . from our earliest infancy we make continual advances in forming more general principles of conduct and reasoning; . . . and . . . what we call philosophy is nothing but a more regular and methodical operation of the same kind. To philosophize . . . is nothing essentially different from reasoning on common life . . . "(ii-iz). This could have been said by Dewey or Huxley; is it consistent with Philo's apparent put- down of "the vulgar," for the ambivalence of which, see note 4? Or is it another con- ceit, this time to remind us that philosophy is inescapable, even if we find no pleasure in the endless irresolvability of all the issues upon which it touches? 524 DENNIS ROHATYN</page><page sequence="7">attempt to defend his position experientially and by inductive reason- ing, and to deal with Philo's successive refutations. This in no way conflicts with what we said above concerning Cleanthes' alleged inabil- ity to understand Philo. Let us assume that this is the case; what I am saying here is that Cleanthes deserves credit for trying, for being the model of a rational citizen and good sport, for not capitulating to forces of intellectual darkness or allowing a moment of weakness and frustra- tion to overpower him. I say rational citizen, because I think (b) Hume is trying to get across a subtle political message in this work, about the conditions for organized living. Developed, it might look something like Josiah Royce's community of interpretation,'5 devoid of the latter's absolute idealism. Regardless of what it might look like if systematized, it boils down to the contention that peace is only possible if we can agree to differ, and that no differences are so great or irresolvable as to be worth fighting (i.e., ceasing communication) about. Humanity, in the last analysis, is more important than God - this is Hume's anthropo- centricity, in contrast to Cleanthes. It is also what makes Hume so squarely an Enlightenment figure. It is this commitment to conversation and its renewal that accounts for the widespread insistence that Cleanthes, not Philo, is the hero of Hume's dialogue. If I am on the right track, it accounts for Pamphilus' holding this, as well as Hume himself."6 We should expect Pamphilus to side with Cleanthes, since the latter is his guardian, and Pamphilus gives us no reason to think that he does not respect and indeed admire his elder.'7 Moreover, Pamphilus is not a philosopher - he may indeed be the ultimate referent of Philo's remark at 107 about the incor- ruptibility of common sense. Therefore, it is not surprising that Pamphi- lus might be unable to follow the more technical side of the discussion. He speaks twice (5, Iz3) of the deep and lasting impression which the conversation recounted in the Dialogues made upon him, and I do not '5 Josiah Royce, The Problem of Christianity, introduction by John E. Smith (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, i968), especially 3I5 ff. I6 That is, if we are to judge by the letter Hume wrote to Elliot in I75i, reprinted in Kemp Smith's edition of Dialogues, op. cit., 87, in which he asks Elliot's "assistance" in making Cleanthes the "hero" of the work. See also "Hume on the argument from design," Dialogues, edited by Pike, 23Z. 17 Significantly, Philo asks that Cleanthes "forgive" the directness with which Philo intrudes upon Pamphilus' education by urging that the young boy adopt the 'no true Christian unless first a sceptic' maxim. One wonders if Pamphilus' remark that nothing ever made greater impression on me than all the reasonings of that day," coupled with his insistence that to him Cleanthes' views seem the likeliest to be true, is not another Humean conceit, designed to placate the Demeas in the audience or else to throw them off the track. (All these comments occur at XII, 1z3.) But it is also possible that Pamphilus is simply a dewy-eyed boy who cannot follow Philonian sub- tlety, and is therefore a safe auditor, though this is doing him an injustice in light of his own eloquent peroration on the limits and restlessness of reason (Pamphilus to Her- mippus, 5). HUME S DIALECTICAL CONCEITS 525</page><page sequence="8">believe this is empty piety, or else why should Pamphilus bother to repeat everything for the benefit of the reader? But that is just it - it was the quality of the discussion, not any definite result obtained, that stood out. As for Hume, I cannot believe that he was unaware of the extent to which Philo comes across as cocksure and arrogant, not only in XII but throughout the debate: Philo never gets ruffled; he never lapses into dogmatism; he is never at a loss for words; and, as we have seen, his remarks are often obnoxious, and thinly veil his own egotism. They are conceited both in the sense defined in this paper, and in the colloquial sense. My feeling is that Hume deliberately constructed the Dialogues in such a way as to balance Philo's superior reason with a defective personality, and, likewise, to sketch Cleanthes as a "nice guy," a bit emotional at times, yet willing to keep an open mind and to give everyone else the benefit of the doubt (including Demea, after the latter has ceased to deserve it), but very much the eighteenth-century gentle- man whose power to reason was not his strong suit. I think, too, that Hume's readers cannot help but react subliminally to these characters, and that many of the scholarly arguments designed to persuade us that Hume "really" = Cleanthes or "really" = Philo are based on the psycho- logical effect which Hume's artistry induced, and which Hume cont- rolled, much as Plato controlled the counterpoint between Socrates and other protagonists. Hume himself, if a psychological inference is wanted, must be a bit of a synthesis between both types, and hence nei- ther one exclusively. We can therefore put to rest the controversy over the identification between author and any one of his characters; Hume's Dialogues are not Berkeley's, nor were they meant to be like that.'8 In all of this, we have left Demea behind - or have we? I said that his exit was the most significant event in Hume's work. It is significant in a number of ways. First, the tendency to lapse into an Anytus, Meletus or "Commie-hunting" type of character is just that, a tendency, in Cleanthes, and it is something which (by example rather than conscious awareness) he fights against. In Demea, on the other hand, it is a way of life, exemplified by his initial comment about seasoningn) their minds with early piety" until they are ". . . tamed . . . to a proper submis- sion and self-diffidence" (7). They, of course, are the young, and Demea's approach is to treat them as objects who can be conditioned in accordance with the master plan of some adult or institutional author- ity. Demea is confident that this conditioning will be so successful that . I have no longer any scruple of opening to them the greatest mysteries of religion, nor apprehend any danger from that assuming arrogance of philosophy, which may lead them to reject the most established doctrines and opinions. (7) i8 Hume modelled himself on Cicero, but as I have not read the latter, I have no idea whether his borrowings from the Roman author are more than superficialities. See Kemp Smith, op. cit., 6o-6i, for some details. 52.6 DENNIS ROHATYN</page><page sequence="9">In other words, brainwash them so that they can no longer think for themselves, and so that philosophy will have no effect on them. We know what kind of a person Demea is, right from the outset; there is no need to develop his character further, as it is incapable of growth. As proof of this, no sooner does Demea find out that Philo is not really on his side in the argument (105) than he finds some excuse to go away. We could call the portrayal of Demea a caricature, except that we all know people like him - and so did Socrates. That, I think, is part of Hume's point. Demea is not merely bigoted or closed-minded; he is also influential - he is the type of person who frequently is found at the helm of society, a "respected pillar" of orthodoxy. He is, to use Hume's own word, dangerous. Dangerous, but not invulnerable. For if there is anyone who exhibits inconsistency and intellectual slovenliness in the Dialogues, it is Demea, not Cleanthes. Demea sets up the ground rules, according to which only the nature, not the existence, of God will be discussed (i9). He proceeds to violate this canon by introducing what he calls "a priori" arguments in IX (75), which, as already mentioned, Cleanthes has no trouble in dispatching. Put to rout, Demea resorts to an argument based on inner feeling, coupled with consciousness of depravity (X, 8i). He is, finally, surprised to learn that Philo has been attempting to subvert the design argument all along, whereas Cleanthes knew it from the beginning, in detecting the "artificial malice" and "finesse" that animated Philo's earliest speech (9), and in wondering why it took Demea so long to perceive it (IO5). It would be comforting to suppose that Demea is too stupid, too illogical, to pose a threat. But one can cite the example of Socrates' indictment and trial as disproof of such a contention. For Hume - and this is the second significant point that emerges from Demea's departure - the only way in which Demea can be neutralized (both personally and as an agent of social repression) is by integrating him into the con- versation, at least long enough to show him his errors and to convince him that self-improvement (i.e., commitment to continued thought) is necessary and desirable. But this does not happen. Unlike Thrasyma- chus, who at least sits through the Republic and chimes in occasional assent, Demea walks out, still maintaining the impotence of philosophy to comprehend ultimate mysteries (while trying to use it to achieve that end - a contradiction remarked by Philo at I z3), and unchanged in his contempt for reason while self-assured that he already knows what the truth is, and therefore that he has a right to educate othersI9 in such a '9 It is fair to say that education, not religion, is the main or overriding theme of this work. And though we may sneer at Demea, in bringing up our own children we know only too well the problem of exposure to certain phenomena, particularly those relat- ing to sexuality and to death. When it comes, e.g., to literature, perhaps the last word has been spoken by the actress Mary Tyler Moore, who has said "as an artist I am unalterably opposed to censorship; as a parent I am all in favor of it." This ambiva- HUME S DIALECTICAL CONCEITS 5z7</page><page sequence="10">way as to deprive them of their freedom to find out this truth for them- selves. The third and most obvious significance of Demea is that he gives us a ready villain. There may be no single hero in this book, but there is someone whose ideology, pedagogy, and methodology are equally reprehensible. It may not matter who is right in the argument between Cleanthes and Philo mentioned above, but it matters very much that there is someone who is wrong, and whose wrongs can be summed up in one word: intolerance. Moreover, when Demea walks out he deprives himself of the opportunity to sit in on Dialogue XII - he misses some important ideas which bear on the very themes with which he is concerned - public welfare and the training of a well-disci- plined, honest body of citizens (II5, II7). This is no accident, of course; it is another deliberate irony in the construction of the work, intended to show that Demea's loss is also ours - that is, increases the chances of negative social influence based on unwillingness to engage in self-corrective inquiry. It increases them, of course, only in proportion as Demean attitudes hold sway; therefore, to the extent that the same spirit of self-correction and willingness to participate in mutual criti- cism as animate Cleanthes and Philo is made the basis for social organi- zation, we need not fear Demean attitudes becoming prevalent. If this makes Hume sound like Dewey or Popper, so be it. In any case I would argue that the topical range of the Dialogues extends well beyond the immediate subject to which most, though by no means all, of the work is confined. Two further points deserve notice. One is that the interplay between Demea and Philo involves "conceits" from the latter. Philo's immediate reaction to Demea's Pavlovian scheme is this: Your precaution . . . of seasoning your children's minds early with piety is certainly very reasonable, and no more than is requisite in this profane and irreligious age. But what I chiefly admire . . . is your method of drawing advantage from the very principles of philosophy . . . which, by inspiring pride and self-sufficiency, have . . . been found so destructive to the principles of religion. (7-8) Can anyone take this passage seriously, in the sense of "seriously" identified earlier? Yet we can see why Philo pretends to agree with Demea, as a prelude to undermining his position. Direct confrontation would not work; it would create ill will, promote hot tempers, and destroy any possibility of demonstrating the falsity of Demea's world- view. The conceit is, for once, not conceited. It is still a "conceit" in the sense we defined, not only because we cannot imagine Philo adhering to it (to do so would be to undermine philosophy, and everything about the life of reason that Philo cherishes), but .because "pride and self- lence is what makes Demea's presence significant, no matter how loathsome he may be. He represents something which cannot be dismissed, even though he is incapable of grasping his own feelings or their importance. We, as readers, must do this for him and for ourselves. 52.8 DENNIS ROHATYN</page><page sequence="11">sufficiency" are character traits of Philo himself. There is an unwitting accuracy of self-description which testifies to Hume's powers of suc- cinct dramatic composition, the more so as it is decidedly not (presented as) a self-insight on Philo's part. Perhaps Philo's problem is that he con- tinues to use this form of irony in XII, where it is no longer necessary. By that time, Demea has fled, and if Philo really does live in "unreserved intimacy" with Cleanthes, he should not have to keep his guard and his razor wit up quite as much. But old habits are not changed overnight, either. The other interesting point is that in light of Demea, Philo's smugness about the philosophical elite' becomes understandable and even some- thing we can condone. It is not just what amounts to embitterment that the vulgar do not appreciate the learned,20 or some other form of psy- chologically overcompensatory breast-beating. Nor is it class snobbery. In the context of the argument, it is a way of distinguishing the intole- rant from the tolerant, Demea from the remaining conversational part- ners. Moreover, we can apply Hume's dictum about the zealots directly to the explosive outcome of Dialogue XI - what he could not achieve in real life, he sublimated into his art, to achieve vicarious gratification. Let us also not forget the initial idea mentioned at the beginning of this section. It is not important who wins the argument, as long as it has some chance of continuing and is mutually beneficial. People like Demea are obnoxious because they do not merely walk out on other people's dialogues, they try to prevent them from taking place (by the "educational" techniques they employ, whose overt intention is to ren- der their victims mentally sterile and incompetent). When Philo alleges that he and Cleanthes have a likelier chance of being saved, he is right, regardless of whether one interprets "saved" in eschatological terms or in human ones.2' Of course, there is (or would be) a fallacy in identify- ing Demea with the vulgar - but only, as already indicated, insofar as the vulgar escape from the educational clutches to which Demea would subject them. And that may be the most important message which Hume has to offer. See notes 4, 14, for discussion. William A. Parent, in "An Interpretation of Hume's Dialogues," Review of Metaphy- sics 30 (1976-77), 105, observes that there is a "deep-seated personality conflict" between Cleanthes and Philo, which Hume stresses. And this is true regardless of whether one identifies Hume with Philo (as Parent does, ibid. Io6-io), and irrespective of the further question as to Hume's (Philo's) "sincerity" in putting forth the views expressed in the Dialogues (ibid., i?z). What Parent does not see is how much Cleanthes and Philo have in common by agreeing to differ, and that this transcends the cleavage between them; a fact whose moral importance is as inestimable as Demea's failure to exhibit anything comparable. HUME' S DIALECTICAL CONCEITS 529</page><page sequence="12">III If I am right, then what Hume is saying is that getting along takes pre- cedence over being right, over knowing anything, over winning an argument or a (Pascalian) bet. This is at least consistent with the stand- point of Hume's second Inquiry, which makes sociability (qualities use- ful and agreeable to ourselves and others) the benchmark of virtue, and castigates its subordination to the "monkish virtues."" If my interpre- tation of the Dialogues has any merit, then it might also force us to reread Treatise as a gigantic thought-experiment whose underlying problematic is: what would be left if we were robbed of the assurance of physical order (causality), of social order (is/ought), and even of inner order (personal identity)? Could we still survive? Are philosophical "foundations" even necessary for us to get along with one another, or can we relate to one another spontaneously and without the interven- tion of rules, abstractions, principles, and other intermediaries?"3 Never mind what Hume's position on this topic ultimately is, or whether it is tenable; the mere fact that he raises such issues is what makes him a great author, and explains why we continue to read him even though his specific analyses, based as they are on the bundle theory of perception, are in every case psychologically obsolete. We can of course "reconstruct" all of Hume's skeptical arguments utilizing more modern premises, and thus assure ourselves of the timelessness and con- tinued cogency of his theoretical doubts. But this is still to miss the wood for the trees, if not in Treatise then certainly in a drama like the Dialogues. And that is why nobody has seen, although perhaps many of us have felt or subliminally appropriated, what Hume is up to in his most mature philosophical work. We read this not as a play but as a legal transcript; we are ourselves so concerned with winning the argument about God or about Hume - that we miss the point of his rhetoric or the implications of his having structured it as a conversation between divergent personalities.24 No wonder then that we neglect Hume's conceits.25 No wonder too that we fail to extract the juice from the Humean press, or that we react to everything which takes place cere- brally, without the immediacy which Hume sought to bring back to a 22 David Hume, An Inquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals, edited by Charles W. Hendel (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1957), 93. 23 This of course was the problem of more than one thinker during the En~iightenment, including Rousseau; it is also Wittgenstein's problem, in attempting to rid philosophy of the need for (rational, nonanthropological) foundations, in all his "late" works. 24 Hume is of course not the only philosopher wronged in this way; Plato comes to mind immediately. 25 To his credit, Pike, in "Hume on the argument from design," Dialogues, 175, notes the way in which Philo parodies Cleanthes' arguments without adopting them. But this is the closest that he or anyone else has come to reading Hume as a dramatist, and it is momentary. 530 DENNIS ROHATYN</page><page sequence="13">world too civilized (and too sordid) to esteem it. Nonetheless we take sides, we identify with Cleanthes or Philo (but, significantly, never with Demea), we show our human tendencies even while doing our best to deny their obtrusive presence. Our scholarly onanism is such that while we debate about design, we ignore the only indisputable example of it Hume's book, which he revised and polished for over two decades and left unpublished at his death, fearing it would be misappreciated. Despite the fame of posterity, he was not wrong. If we distinguish between argument and rhetoric, then in consigning, e.g., character development to the latter category we imply its irrelevancy. In Treatise the arguments, though powerful, are but prologue to the rhetoric of sociability - they make it possible and they justify it.76 In Dialogues the characters convey the same message by their example rather than didactically, a subtlety which is correspondingly easier to miss. The characters are a microcosm of the race in action, and the departure of Demea creates a threatening imbalance which is never resolved, just as in life. Hume's art mirrors human nature, the subject of all his writing. But we are either too busy chasing down arguments or else too victim- ized by the mesmerizing quality of Hume's art to practice the literary skills of simultaneous detachment and sensitivity needed to grasp some- thing of the overall point, let alone (as I am sure Hume hoped a few readers could) be cathartically transformed by it. We read philosophical works, but we do not know how to read them. Yet we get caught up in the vitality of one or another of these charac- ters, and so - naively but naturally - we suppose that Hume must have been, too, or that his whole effort was bent toward vindication of one of their positions.27 But we always do a synoptic thinker an injus- tice when we project our own limitations of vision and of self-discipline onto him. This is why the conceits we traced in Part I are not conceits at all, but provocations intended to arouse the reader from dogmatic, or any kind of intellectual slumbers. It is also why Hume chose the dia- logue as the most fitting mode of presentation for his insights, despite the possibility that its message would be misunderstood (after all, that had been happening to Hume for 35 years, so why not try something different, even if it was left to Hume's nephew to make the effort pub- z6 Treatise, op. Cit., I, iv, 7, 269. To be sure, Hume also says (ibid., 270) that when he becomes "tir'd with amusement and company" it is time for him to retreat into his chamber and begin anew the task of discovering principles, foundations and causes (ibid., 27i). But the "rhetoric" of sociability is not divorced from the skeptical argu- ments which lead up to it; each one, I would argue, is part of the other; strategically they entail one another. For the same reason, character development cannot be secon- dary to the presentation of arguments in the Dialogues, but each reinforces and expli- cates the other. This thesis does require book-length exposition; I can only state it here, as a goad to myself and others. 27 Thus Parent, Pike, Kemp Smith, and 99 per cent of the rest of the literature, notwith- standing its many fine contributions to our understanding of Hume.

I suppose there is a keen kind of justice in the fact that while the characters argue about God they miss the chance to get closer to one another."8 This displace- ment of the true emotional center of interest is paralleled, probably not accidentally, in our own attitude toward the study of Hume. We can- not, or will not, say what is really on our minds, until after awhile it is not there any more. Hence the need to rouse people back to a vivid emotional identification with themselves, for which purpose the con- ceits that Hume inserts are admirably suited, but historically belated. Of course, we can still enjoy and take apart the arguments, as Hume indeed meant us to; so the effect of his writing is far from nil. But nei- ther is it what he wanted. I am sure that in some not so idle moments Hume wondered whether our need to posit an omniscient, omnipotent planner does not stem from the singular lack of success which our own plans betray. This alone makes God Radically Other, at the same time as the conception of Him is subject to the charge of anthropomorphism. Hume's personal experience made it unnecessary for him to put this in theological terms. And his secularity, i.e., his primary emphasis on the joy of living hic et nunc, even amidst all our failures, would certainly have made him eschew such formulations. But while we are saying this, let us again note how Hume is Radically Other than our finite understanding of him, even though we can only comprehend him in the terms of our own scholarship. But the situation is not hopeless. After all - symmetry demands that I end with a conceit - there is whatever historically belated effect may be wrought by this essay, by the execution of its design. 28 The "intimacy" passage (io8) aside, since Philo, too, is more concerned with winning the argument than with bonding his friendship or even understanding his opponent; though both of these result from their conversation or are presupposed by it, they are not brought before the consciousness of either party - perhaps Hume thought that would spoil the unaffected quality of the relationship, or that explicitly aiming at such effects could only diminish rather than intensify mutual understanding and "I-thou" empathy. It certainly would spoil the artistry of the Dialogues, and turn them into another didactic exercise; for this reason alone Hume was justified in avoiding such stratagems. We can trace this chiefly in the disappearance of Demea, rather than in any overt moves by either of the other protagonists; and seen in this light, the scholarly tendency to ignore Hume's messages is far more pardonable than my sometimes harsh judgments would indicate. 532 DENNIS ROHATYN</page></plain_text>
