<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NOTIONS OF GOD IN THE ANCIENT CHINESE RELIGION BY JOSEPH SHIH Pontificia Universith Gregoriana Rome It is a well known fact that in imperial China, the emperor was hailed as Son of Heaven. 1) The explanation is less evident. According to the official version, this was because the emperor had received the Man- date of Heaven. This interpretation is based on a theory first ex- pounded by the Duke of Chou, following the downfall of the Shang dynasty. The Shang dynasty was the first dynasty in historical China. It is believed to have begun in 1766 B.C. In 1122 B.C., it was overthrown by King Wu who founded the succeeding Chou dynasty. The Duke of Chou was a brother of King Wu. After the latter's death, while his son, King Cheng, was still a minor, the Duke ruled the newly pacified coun- try. It was during his regency that he stated this famous theory of the Mandate of Heaven. 2) The notion of mandate was a familiar one. When a king appointed a subject to a certain office, he was said to give a mandate to that of- fice. When he dismissed the official, it was said that he took away his mandate. The Duke applied this notion to the action of Heaven, who was believed to govern the whole world, and declared that, because the Shang kings had displeased Heaven with their wrong doing, Heaven had taken away His Mandate and had given it over to the Chou kings. 3) Obviously the Duke promulgated this doctrine for the sake of justifying the Chou's conquest of China. However, from the van- tage point of the history of religion, the story is of unique importance. I) Heaven or T'ien, as we shall see, is a name of the Supreme God in China. 2) Homer H. Dubs made a close study of the history of the promulgation of this doctrine in his article "The Archaic Royal Jou Religion." (T'oung Pao, XLVI, 1958, pp. 217-257). Cfr.

III, pp. 453-463. 3) Ibid. p. 231</page><page sequence="2">Ioo Joseph Shih It signalized indeed the beginning of the amalgamation of two concepts of a Supreme God that was to exercise a decisive influence on the further development of the religious thinking of the Chinese people. These two concepts were the Ti and T'ien. The word Ti - which we shall translate as God-on-High -is found on the inscribed oracle bones rescued from the ruins of the Shang capital. 4) There, Ti is said to command the rain, the wind, the thunder, the drought, and the harvest. To Him are attributed victories, defeats, disasters, illnesses, and death. Indeed, His will was consulted by kings and was revered as Supreme Law. 5) Contrary to an opinion once pre- valent, it is now established that the oracle bones do mention sacrifices to Ti. Of these the ting and ti are the most important ones. The former was held in the ancestral temple in honor of one's deceased father; the latter in the open country to ask for a good year. 6) It is therefore generally assumed that Ti, or God-on-High, was worshipped by the Shang people as their Supreme God. 7) The word T'ien is also found in the oracle records, but it does not refer to the Supreme God. 8) The T'ien, as a name of a Supreme God, appeared first in the literature of the Chou period. There, T'ien is given anthropomorphic attributes. He is said to see, to hear, and to watch over all men. He is affected by men's doings. He is happy and angry with them. He blesses those who please Him and sends calamities upon those who offend Him. Though His ways are inscrutable, they are not arbitrary but always favorable to the virtuous, unfavorable to the wicked. T'ien is implored, is believed to be compassionate, ready to 4) The Shang kings used to consult the will of the Supreme God or their ancestors by means of a particular method of divination called pu. The materials used in this divination were either the under-shells of tortoise or shoulder bones of cattle, on which the subjects of the consultation were often incised. Tens of thousands of shells and bones of this sort have been found in the recent excava- tion of the ruins of the Shang Capital in the modern Hunan province. These shells and bones are commonly called oracle bones. 5) Kunio Shima, A Study of Oracle letters from the Ruins of Yin's capital, (Tokyo, Chiugoktkai kenkiuhai, I959. In Japanese language). Pp.

On Him indeed depend both the life of each man and the dynasties of the country. 9) T'ien is even invoked, together with Ti, as a tribute to a pretty girl: "How like T'ien she is; how like Ti she is !" 10to) Nathan Soederblom sees rightly in this verse a striking indication that T'ien is, as well as Ti, a personal God. 11) T'ien, or Heaven, is the name of the Supreme God of the Chou people. 12) The theory of the Mandate of Heaven supposes the unity of the Su- preme God who gave His mandate successively to the Shang and Chou kings. Therefore, it goes without saying that, after their conquest of Shang China, the Chou rulers considered Heaven and God-on-High to be one and the same God. Nothing attests this belief better than the inscriptions on two similar bronze vessels, both of the early Chou period. On the one, the Mao-kung ting, it is stated: "The Great Heaven has found no displeasure but watches over and protects us." On the other, the Shih-yin ting, one reads instead: "The Great God-on-High has found no displeasure but watches over and protects us." 13) The Chinese classics in general reveal also the same persuasion. 14) However, this does not exclude the possibility that Heaven and God- on-High had been once two distinct deities. Indeed there are indica- tions that invite us to believe in such an eventuality. The story of the impious Wu-i, for instance, is well known. Wu-i was a Shang king, apprehensive of Heaven's glory, whom he believed to be the Supreme God of a rival people. In order to keep up his spirits, he made an effigy of Heaven, feigned to fight with it, and then knocked it down. Again he hung a bag full of blood, shot upwards at it, and then boasted that he had wounded the Heavenly Spirit. 15) On the other hand, to the Chou people, who came from the Western frontier of Shang China, God-on-High was first a foreign God who lived in the East. But, as they gradually gained strength, they came not only to challenge the 9) Bruno Schindler, "The development of Chinese conceptions of Supreme Beings," Asia Major: Introductory Volume, pp. 298-366.

This is seen in one of the "Odes of the kingdom," collected in the Book of Poetry. This ode sings the rise of the Chou royal house. It actually tells the story about how God-on-High, disappointed with the depravity of His people, came to dwell in the Western region and set up the house of Chou as His new representative on earth. 16) So it is that, although the Chinese tradition in general believes in the unity of Heaven and God-on-High, the question has been raised as to the nature of this unity. It is indeed not impossible that the two had been once separate deities. If it had been so, how was it that they had come to be recognized as one single God? Edouard Chavannes dealt with this question, though from a different point of view, in 19ioo in his communication to the First International Congress of History of Religion. 17) He arrived at the conclusion that neither Heaven nor God-on-High really meant Supreme God. Heaven, he contended, represented nature whereas God-on-High was nothing but a deified ancestor. At the basis of such a contention was the pre- sumption that the ancient Chinese religion had developed from two distinct elements: the one animistic and the other naturalistic. The former showed itself in ancestor worship and the latter in the cult of the Spirit of the Soil. The construction of the ancestral hall and the erection of the altar to the Spirit of the Soil signaled indeed the con- stitution of a new state. 18is) Chavannes held that the Spirit of the Soil had been originally territorial deity and that his dignity had risen in direct proportion to the territorial expansion of the state. It is by this process that he attempted to explain how Heaven and God-on-High came to mean one divinity. Here are his words: But, with the progress of the power of the king, this particular cult slowly assumes a predominant importance. Religion develops parallel with politics. The Spirit of the Soil of the royal house was at first only one - though the most prominent one - among the innumerable Spirits of the Soil. Now he gradually extends his domain until he finally comes to symbolize the entire territory of the empire. So, one Spirit of the Soil, Hou-t'u, changes his identity and becomes the Sovereign Earth. In like manner, the Spirit of the Soil losses more and more the anthropomorphic qualities which once enabled 16) James Legge, C.C., vol. IV, pp. 448-455. 17) Edouard Chavannes, "Dieu du sol dans l'ancienne religion Chinoise," Revue d'histoire des religions, 9Igol, pp. 27-48. 18) Ibid., pp. 46-48.</page><page sequence="5">The Notions of God in the Ancient Chinese Religion IO3 him to be considered as a God-on-High, the remote ancestor of the earthly kings, and grows to the full extent of the sky. He confused himself with Heaven. Heaven and God-on-High, who were once probably two distinct divinities, came to amalgamate with one another. And in their uneven combi- nation, the attributes of Heaven encroached ever more upon those of God- on-High. August Heaven and Sovereign Earth: these are, after all, the two objects of the royal, and then the imperial cult. Thus, a naturalistic dualism, which includes the whole universe, imposes itself at the very moment when the sovereign himself claims to be the ruler of the world. 19) Although his opinion can no longer be defended today, Chavannes did make two acute and pertinent observations. He pointed to the constant association of God-on-High with the ancestral worship on the one hand and that of Heaven with the cult of the Spirit of the Soil on the other. He insisted, moreover, on the role of the earth in the evolution of the religious conceptions in early China. We shall use these two observa- tions as guide-lines in our study on the evolution of the notion of the Supreme God in the ancient Chinese religion. But to do so we must first correct his opinion about the origin of the notion of Hou-t'u, or the Sovereign Earth, with the help of two more recent studies. These are Berthold Laufer's Jade: A study in Chinese Archaeology and Reli- gion 20) and Carl Hentze's Bronzegeriit, Kultbauten, Religionen im diltesten China der Shang Zeit (Bronze objects, cultic buildings, reli- gion in the earliest China of Shang time). 21) Laufer made a sharp distinction between the deity of Earth (T'u or ti) and the Spirit of the Soil (she). Basing his observations largely on Chavannes' study, he specified that the Spirit of the Soil is a male god of a partially anthropomorphic concept. It is a god restricted in power as to space and time, a god of territorial groups, of social communities, occupying a more or less limited area of soil. 22) He gave a concise description of how the multitude of Spirits of the Soil were conceived in an organized body: "There is a complex system of an official hier- archy of a plurality of gods of the Soil graduated according to rank and power. The individual families harbor their God of Soil, the terri- torial communities have their own, the territorial officials have their own, and the feudal lords and the emperor have their own. The im- 19) Ibid., p. 44. 20) Published in Chicago, 1912. 21) Published in Antwerpen, De Sikkel, 1951. 22) Laufer, op. cit., p. 145.</page><page sequence="6">o104 Joseph Shih perial God of Soil is, so to speak, the particular property of the dy- nasty, and His power vanishes with its extinction. The new rising dynasty chooses a new God of Soil of its own by erecting to him a new altar and neutralizes the action of his predecessor by building an en- closure around his altar." Hence Laufer concluded that the Spirits of the Soil were "individual gods of a local and temporary existence con- nected with the coeval living owners of the soil, living and dying with them." 22) In contrast with the Spirits of the Soil, the deity of Earth was infinite in space and time. "It is an almighty great abstract deity like Heaven, and the object of veneration and worship on the part of the people and in particular of the emperor, through all generations. 23) Laufer claimed that "It is the telluric deity whereas the Spirit of the Soil merely shares the function of a territorial tutelary genius." 24) So far Laufer was perfectly right. The Spirit of the Soil and the deity of Earth differed indeed not only in seize but also, and above all, in their respective function. But he exaggerated his point when he went on to argue against Chavannes who thaught that the dualistic cult of Heaven and Earth had assumed its importance only since the time of the emporor Wu of the Han dynasty (141-87 B.C.). He saw very well the difference of function between the deity of Earth and the Spirit of the Soil, but he had overlooked the fact that the function of the earth itself had varied in the course of time. Though the sacrifice to the Earth had dated from time immemorial, the cult to the Earth, as a co-agent of Heaven in the production of the universe, was indeed of relatively late origin. It was Carl Hentze, undoubtedly the most autho- ritative interpreter of the ancient Chinese religion, who finally brought to light what both Chavannes and Laufer had failed to notice, in his monumental work which we have mentioned above. Hentze called attention to a text of the Book of History which pur- ports to record the instructions of a certain chief minister in the early Shang period, named I Yin, to the king T'ai Chia. The text is trans- lated literally as follows: "I Yin composed a memorial for the king T'ai Chia, in which he stated: 'The former king kept his eye on the direc- tion of the illustrious Spirit of Heaven. Thereby he served both what is up-above and what is down-below, namely the spirits of the Upper- 23) Ibid., p. I45. 24) Ibid., p. 145.</page><page sequence="7">The Notions of God in the Ancient Chinese Religion lo5 world and of the underworld as well as the Spirits of the Soil and Grain, and of the ancestral hall. Thus, there was none to whom he did not present his veneration." 25) Among the spirits mentioned in the text one counts both the Spirit of the Underworld and the Spirit of the Soil. Hentze insisted emphatically in distinguishing these two species. Like Chavannes, he understood the latter to be a territorial deity (Geist des Grund und Bodens). He noted that it lived on the earth, staying, so to speak, "between two worlds, namely the Upperworld and the Un- derworld, yet belonging to none of them." The Spirit of the Under- world, on the other hand, as the Chinese name ch'i indicates, was the Spirit of one's native land and ancestral origin (Erd- und Sippen- geist). 26) It was related to the demon of the Underworld, represented by the animal mask (t'ao-t'ieh) which appears so frequently on the iconography of Shang China. The whole book of the Bronzegerit deals indeed with this subject. In the light of these further studies, the observation of Chavannes, concerning the role of the earth in the evolution of the religious con- ception in early China, needs to be revised. First of all, it is no longer feasible to see in the Sovereign Earth a mere outgrowth of the Spirit of the Soil. It is necessary to distinguish their respective functions. Further, it had been established that, in the earliest China of Shang time, the function of the earth had been one of origin. Thus, we are now aware of the variety of functions which the earth played in the course of Chinese history. In earlier China, it was held successively as an origin, as a domain, and as a principle of creation. The Chinese lan- guage has coined three different words to indicate those three func- tions of the earth. These are ch'i, she and ti. Perhaps it is advisable to point out that these three words usually combine with other words to form definite expressions. Thus, she couples normally with chi to form the expression she-chi which means originally the Spirits of the Soil and of Grain, consequently, also the state. 27) Ti contrasts with T'ien. T'ien-ti indicates either Heaven and earth or the universe as a whole. 28) Shen-ch'i is an archaism. Hentze restored its meaning as 25) Hentze, op. cit., pp. 99-1oo. 26) Ibid., pp. 98-1o4. 27) The Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Chinese Language, vol. 23, p. 462, n. 119. 28) Ibid., vol. 8, p. 291, n. 332.</page><page sequence="8">io6 Joseph Shih the spirits of the Upper- and Underworld. Ch'i being the Spirit of the ancestral origin, is closely related to the clan. 29) To those who are ac- quainted with the genius of the Chinese language, it is not at all sur- prising that these three expressions fall into a recognizable pattern, that is: shen-ch'i - she-chi - T'ien-ti, namely: clan - state - uni- verse. It is indeed the aim of this study to show that this pattern cor- responds not only to the process in the transformation of the political institutions during the succeeding Shang, Chou, and Ch'in-Han dy- nasties, but also to the evolution of the conception of the Supreme God during the same periods. Viewed in this perspective, the question about the unity of the Su- preme God in the ancient Chinese religion takes on a new significance. It no longer interests itself in knowing whether Heaven and God-on- High had been once two separate deities and how they had come to be recognized as one God. It seeks now to understand how, during those three stages of the formative period of their nation, the Chinese wor- shipped the Supreme God under various names, what were the concrete relations these names implied, and how were these names related to each other. Consequently, the present paper shall fall under three head- ings. The first one shall deal with the Shang dynasty (1766-1122 B.C.) when the earth was seen as the origin of all beings and was symbolized by the demon of the Underworld. Under that dynasty the Supreme God was called Ti, or God-on-High, and honored principally in relation to the royal ancestral worship. We like to describe Him as God of the fathers. The second part shall have to do with the Chou dynasty (I122- 221 B.C.) when the earth was regarded as the domain of the king and was personified by the Spirit of the Soil. Under this dynasty, the Supreme God was named Heaven and honored as the prototype of the Chou king. This Supreme God may be best represented as the Heaven- ly king. The last part of this paper shall cover the Ch'in (221-206 B.C.) and Han (206 B.C.-A.D. 222) dynasties when the earth was believed to be an agent of creation and was hailed as the Sovereign Earth. It was then that the Supreme God of the Chinese came to be recognized formally as the Lord of the Universe. 29) Hentze, op. cit., p. IoI.</page><page sequence="9">The Notions of God in the Ancient Chinese Religion 107 I. Ti, GOD-ON-HIGH, GOD OF THE FATHERS Shang is the first dynasty of historical China. It lasted from about 1766 to 1122 B.C. The Chinese tradition speaks of it in the following terms: "The Shang rulers feared the spirits and led the people to serve them. They were more eager to sacrifice to the dead than to hold court ceremonies, more prompt to inflict punishments than to give re- wards." 30) Whatever the justice of this remark, the recent excavations, at An-yang, in the ruins of the Shang capital, confirmed the belief that ancestral worship occupied the central place in the religion of the Shang people. 31) It is only in relation to this cult that we can hope to under- stand their conception of the Supreme God. The Shang ancestral worship was a complicated institution. To un- derstand it correctly we must first clarify the question as to who were the Shang ancestors? The Records of the Grand Historian of China (Shih-chi) has registered a genealogy of the Shang kings. It begins with Ch'i. Ch'i is said to have been born miraculously. His mother became pregnant after swallowing a swallow's egg. In the same gene- alogy, Wei is listed in the eighth generation, Ta-yi in the fourtheenth, and Ti-hsin in the last. Ta-yi is the founder of the Shang dynasty. He is also called T'ang and Ch'eng. From Ta-yi to Ti-hsin there are eigh- teen generations and thirty kings. 32) For centuries this was the only source of our knowledge about the Shang ancestors. But the recent dis- covery of the inscribed oracle bones in the ruins of the Shang capital has given us the opportunity of testing its validity. In fact, several serious studies have been undertaken and the result has been encour- aging. While confirming in general the accuracy of the information provided by the Grand Historian, those studies have attested to the fact that only the ancestors from Wei onwards had ceremonial names and received regular sacrifices during the yearly cycles. Consequently it is believed that these alone were the real Shang royal ancestors. Among the names that stand above that of Wei, Hsiang-t'u and Chang- jo are not found in the oracle records. 33) The rest - Ch'i, Chao-king, 30) Li Chi (The Book of Rites) ch. 32 Piao chi (The record on example).

They were referred to sometimes as kao-tzu (Higher Ancestors), other times as wang (Kings) or tsung (Ancestral Origin). Sacrificies were offered to them in the same manner as to natural deities, and rain and good years were begged of them. 34) A question rises therefore: Who were these so-called Higher Ancestors? Prof. Kunio Shima thinks that they were the five genii worshipped in the wu-ssu, or the "five sacrifices." 35) As objects of the "five sacrifices", the five genii belonged to an age, in which the function of the earth was no longer expressed in the form of the Demon of the Underworld. Hence their relation to the ancestral line could no longer be readily understood. However, since religious practices may outlive faith and old rites often receive new meanings, we may assume Prof. Kunio Shima's suggestion as being substantially correct. The relation of the Higher Ancestors to the ancestral line may be better understood in the light of a legend concerning the origin of the house of Tsu Wen, who was the most famous chief minister in the state of Ch'u. This legend was told in the late Chou period. However, it should be noted that the state of Ch'u was located on the southern side of the Yangtzu River and, for this reason, was less influenced by the Chou culture. The legend has been translated by James Legge as follows: A certain Jo Ao took to his harem a daughter of the house of Yun, who bore to him Tou po-pi. On his father's death, this son followed his mother to Yun and was brought up there. He had an affair with a daughter of tlhe viscount of Yun, the fruit of which was a son, afterwards styled Tzu Wen. This child's mother caused it to be thrown away in the marsh land of Mung. There a tigress suckled him. The viscount of Yu saw this when hunting, and returned home in terror. His wife then told him the whole story, and he sent for the child and had it cared for. The people of Ch'u called sucklings ku and tigers wu-t'ou. The child was therefore named ku wu-t'ou, and his mother was married to Po-pi. It grew up and subsequently became the chief minister of Ch'u, Tzu Wen. 36) This story struck C. Hentze with its resemblance to the motif of the well known Yii bronze in the Sumimoto collection. 37) Here a child is 34) Kunio Shima, op. cit., pp. 357-247. 35) Ibid., pp. 246-247. 36) James Legge, C.C. vol.

In the one, as in the other case, Hentze recognized the myth of the creation of the first mortal man, namely the miraculous birth of the progenitor of a clan. It was his contention that the tigress in the two cases was nothing but an embodiment of the Demon of the Underworld. She represented therefore the Spirit of the native land and ancestral origin. 38) This claim was substantiated with solid iconographical evidence. There is no reason for doubting its validity. Taken for granted this thesis, it is easy to establish the relation of the Higher Ancestors to the Shang royal ancestry. These were like the tigress but various embodiments of the same Demon of the Underworld. They represented the Spirit of the native land and ancestral origin of the Shang royal house. Though the Higher Ancestors are not ancestors in the biological sense of the word it is through them that we are to learn about the na- ture of the Shang ancestral worship. This may seem paradoxical. But we must keep in mind that, in early China, only the aristocracy erected temples to their ancestors. The common people, who were said to have no ancestors, were not entitled to do so. 39) According to an ancient Chinese tradition, this was because only the aristocracy bore the clan names which warranted their descent from the ancient sage kings who were supposed to have been born miraculously through the divine in- fluence upon their mother. 40) Indeed, it is this belief, witnessed in both the mythology and iconography of Shang China, that was the theme celebrated in the Shang ancestral worship. The belief in the miraculous birth of the progenitor of the king's clan in Shang China is rooted in a particular cosmogonic conception which C. Hentze has restored in his monograph entitled: Tod, Auferstehung, Weltordnung (Death, Resurrection, World Order). In this study, Hentze calls attention to an iconographical detail found on a number of sacrificial vessels of Shang period. Where it is found it is seen on the forehead of the animal mask. It is the ideogram kung. With twG hands opposed to each other and a piece of jade placed in the middle of 38) Ibid., p. I1I4. 39) Li chi, ch. 23 chi fa (The law of sacrifices). Cfr.

But since it is written on the forehead of a divinity, it is to be expected that it hides a certain esoteric signification which Hentze has deciphered. He sees in the jade, that stands between the two hands, the sketch of a compound of two houses of the dead, the one with its upside up and the other with its upside down. He thinks that it is a sort of magical wheel. With the house of the dead now set upside up and now hang upside down, it signifies the cyclical movement of the eternal return. At the same time it symbolizes the totality of the universe which includes both the world of the living and that of the dead. 41) It is evident that similar sym- bolism implies the belief that the underworld is not only the abode of the dead but also the well-spring of life. Of this belief the Demon of the Underworld with its two mouths, the one devours and the other spits, is indeed but a dramatic representation. So far we have distinguished the real royal ancestors from the so- called Higher Ancestors. We have defined the true meaning of the Shang ancestral worship and have discovered the cosmogonic concep- tion that underlaid it. Now, we may broach safely the main subject of our study, namely the relation between God-on-High and the Shang royal ancestors. Let us first state our question. The twentieth chapter of the Book of Rites (Li-chi), bearing the title chi-fa, purports to relate the ancient rules of sacrifices. The accuracy of its information remains in doubt. Nevertheless, it repre- sents the view of one of the schools of liturgical studies in the early Han period. This school enumerated four types of sacrifices; ti, chiao, tsu, tsung. Whereas tsu and tsung were offered to the ancestors, ti and chiao were properly speaking, sacrifices to the Supreme God. However, certain ancestors of particular merit might be invited to take part as associates to the Supreme God. Dealing with the sacrifices in Shang times, the chapter states: "The Shang kings offered the ti sacrifice to k'u, the chiao sacrifice to Ming, the tsu sacrifice to Ch'i, and the tsung sacrifice to Tang." 42) Of the four persons mentioned as receiving the four types of sacrifices three are known to us. Indeed T'ang was the founder of the Shang dynasty. Ming was one of the five Higher An- 41) In Le Symbolisme cosmique des monuments religieux (Serie Orientale Roma XIV, Roma, Is M.E.O. 1957) pp. 91-117. 42) Li chi, ch. 23 chi fa (The law of sacrifices).

The only person unfamiliar to us is k'u, to whom was attributed the most solemn ti sacrifice. A Han commentator of the early Chinese philosophical writings once observed: "The Great k'u is an ancestor. He is also known as God-on-High." 43) This remark seems to support the opinion of Chavannes who saw in God-on-High a glorified Shang ancestor. But is God-on-High really a deified an- cestor? This is the question we want to examine. Since the answer to this question depends on the identity of the Great K'u our task consists essentially in comparing the various traditions concerning that person. Now the sacrificial odes of the Shang house sang of its glorious origin in the following words: "Heaven bade the dark bird to come down and bear the Shang." 44) This verse has pro- voked diverse commentaries. The commentator Mao, being a Confu- cianist, gave a rather demythologized interpretation. As he understood it, Chien-ti, the mother of Ch'i, was a lady belonging to the harem of the ancient emperor k'u. She accompanied the emperor at the time of the vernal equinox to sacrifice and prayed to the first Match-maker (kao-mei), 45) and the result was the birth of Ch'i, who was believed to be the progenitor of the Shang clan. 46) This interpretation contra- dicts itself and can not be taken seriously. The Grand Historian, Ssu- ma Chien, seems to be more consistent. He, too, considered K'u to be Chien-ti's husband. But he understood the conception of Ch'i as mira- culous. According to him the mother was bathing in open air when a swallow made its appearance and dropped an egg. She took it and swallowed it, and became the mother of the Shang royal clan. 47) It is interesting to note that in both versions K'u was pictured like a hu- man being and played relatively an unimportant role. If, then, he re- ceived the most solemn ti sacrifice, the fact is not to be attributed to the miraculous birth of Ch'i. The same Ssu-ma Chien recorded another tradition about K'u in the chapter on the marvelous deeds and reigns of the "Fibe Emperors," with which he began his account of early Chinese history.

Even the story of succession of the two last Emperors, Yao and Shun, which had exercised so great an influence in the formation of political thought in ancient China, proves to be a myth. Prof. Tu Er-wei contends that it describes in fact the succession of the new moon to the old. Indeed, Yao is said to have reigned twenty eight years, a number which cor- responds to that of the days of the phases of the moon in the sky. Moreover, like the new moon, Shun succeeded Yao three years (days) after the latter's death. 48) K'u is mentioned, after the Yellow Em- peror and Chiian-hsii, as the third of the Five Emperors. He, too, must be a moon-god, for he is said to have been intelligent and to have announced his own name as soon as he was born. His name was the same as that of the stone who was a good archer. The latter appears in ancient Chinese literature as a heavenly god. Prof. Tu takes him to be a moon-god. Both the stone and bow, he argued, refer normally to the moon. 49) Now, in the cosmogony of Shang China, the moon and the under- world are mutually convertible, for it is through the moon that the secret of the Underworld has been revealed. Indeed, the moon waxes and wanes. When waxing, she resembles in shape a multitude of thing: she is hailed for calling all things into existence. When she is on the wane, the sphere of being diminishes: she is heared because she swal- lows things up. But when the new moon reappears, the multitude of things come again into being: she is then believed to spit out what she has swallowed. Thus, like the Underworld, the moon is both creator and annihilator, both saviour and destroyer, both the fountain of life and the abode of the dead. The Demon of the Underworld has a pair of horns in the form of mushrooms which represent moon houses. 50) It is the personification of the lunar as well as telluric hierophanies. Considering, therefore, the cosmogonic conception, that underlaid the Shang religious institution, we should not find it surprising that God- on-High was confused with a moon-god and was consequently taken for a Higher Ancestor. Rather we should expect that He would have been considered not only as a moon-god but also as a deity of Earth. 48) The Religious system of Ancient China: Studies of the God Dao, Ti and Hou-t'u (Taipei, 1960), p. go (in Chinese). 49) Ibid., p. 88. 50) Hentze, op. cit., pp. 81-97.</page><page sequence="15">The Notions of God in the Ancient Chinese Religion 113 Such indeed was exactly the case. An instance may be cited from the Book of Changes where God-on-High is said to "come forth in the sign of arousing." At the first reading, one may think only of his relation to the spring thunder. But the context says more. Thunder is heard when sacrifices are being offered at the ancestral temple and at the altar of Earth. 51) Another instance is more explicit. It is found in a hymn bearing the title "the coming of God-on-High," sung during the Han dynasty on the occasion of the suburban sacrifice in spring. The words sound: I. God-on-High descends on the central altar; All the spirits wait on him along the four sides. Let us rectify our intentions, To be worthy of the scene. The universe rests in perfect harmony; Every thing follows the way of nature. Within the four seas, peace and tranquility prevail, The civil laws are kept in force, But the military expeditions are not persued. The Sovereign Earth is a wealthy Goddess; Her light illuminates the three luminous bodies. She looks well at ease In her beautiful yellow garment. II. As the spring bursts forth, It stirs the roots of plants. Its unction extends to all, Touching even insects and worms.

On the contrary, just as the Higher Ancestors, who were not ancestors in the strict sense of the word, have been listed in the genealogy of the Shang kings, so God-on-High, sho was really a Supreme God, was sometimes taken for a human ancestor. It was, therefore, not a case of deification of a royal ancestor but rather of assimilation of a Supreme God to a human being. 54) It is for this reason that we have said that Chavannes' opinion can no longer be held. However, there remains the fact that God-on-High was sometimes taken for an ancestor: this is in itself an indication of the ambiguity of the notion of the Supreme God in Shang China - we have explained how this ambiguity was due to the cosmoginic conception that under- laid the institution of the Shang ancestral worship. II. T'ien, HEAVEN: THE HEAVENLY KING The Shang dynasty ended in I122 B.C. It was succeeded by the Chou dynasty. The new dynasty proved to be mightier than its pre- decessor. In order to secure their suzerainty over the heterogeneous population, the Chou rulers sought alliances with the native leaders of the subjugated peoples. They succeeded in doing so by confirming the latters' traditional authority over their respective peoples. Thus feuda- lism was introduced in China. Under the new regime the power of the government was shared by diverse clans; ancestors no longer served to integrate them. The ancestral temple lost its prominence. Instead, the cult of Heaven and that of the Spirit of the Soil became prominent. Thus, along with the new form of government a new form of religion 53) The last two examples are taken from texts that date from a time much later than the Shang dynasty. If we have referred to them, it is because we are interested not to so much in the beliefs of the Shang people as such, as in their conception of the Supreme God; for the Shang dynasty would collapse in time, but the notion of God-on-High would go on. To be sure, it would undergo modifi- cations, but the modifications would reveal rather than hide the qualifies of the original notion. 54) Compare with what Prof. Derk Bodde has said of the problem of Euhe- merization in Chinese mythology in general. Cfr. Samuel Noah Kramer (ed.) (Mythologies of the Ancient World (A Doubleday Anchor Original, New York, I96I), pp. 372-376.</page><page sequence="17">The Notions of God in the Ancient Chinese Religion 15 also emerged. We learn of the constitution of the new religious insti- tution from a passage of the Book of History (Shu-ching) which re- lates the founding of the Chou capital. Indeed, soon after the overthrow of the Shang dynasty and after the suppression of the rebellion caused by its remnants, the Chou rulers undertook to build the capital to con- solidate their dominion. The event is recorded in these terms: "The day following, being the day of yih-maou, the Duke of Chou came in the morning to do, and thoroughly surveyed the plans for the new city. On ting-sze, the third day after, he offered two bulls as victims in the suburbs (chiao), and on the morrow, mio-woo, at the altar to the Spirit of Soil (she) in the new city, he sacrificed a bull, a goat, and a pig." 55) Here we are told that as soon as the plan for the construc- tion of the capital had been laid out, the Duke of Chou came in person to mark out the spots for the erection of the altars of Heaven and of the Spirit of the Soil. This shows the prominent place which these two cults were to hold under the new regime. Unlike the religion of the Shang people, which had centered around the ancestral temple, the Chou would develop their liturgy principally in relation to the cults of Heaven and of the Spirit of the Soil. The same passage has given rise to an animated controversy concer- ning the number of sacrifices the Duke of Chou had offered on the day of ting-sze. This issue interests us in so far as it confronts us with the need of determining the role of the earth under the new religious institution, thus providing us with the means for assessing the con- crete expression, in which the notion of Supreme God was grasped by the faithful of the Chou religion. In order to acquaint us with the subject of controversy, we are reminded that under the Han dynasty, two chiao sacrifices were to be offered: the one to Heaven, the other to the Sovereign Earth. It is on the basis of this practice that some commentators contended that the Duke of Chou had offered two sacri- fices on that occasion, the one to Heaven and the other to the Sover- eign Earth. As corroboration, they noted that the Duke was said to have sacrificed two bulls. But other commentators questioned the canonicity of the Han practice. They believed that in earlier times the suburban sacrifice (chiao) had been offered to Heaven alone. Accordingly, they held that the Duke had offered only one sacrifice. As to the two bulls 55) James Legge, C.C. vol. III, p. 423.</page><page sequence="18">S116 Joseph Shih sacrificed, they explained that they belonged to Heaven and Hou Chi. Hou Chi was supposed to be the founder of the Chou lineage. As such he was invited to take part in the suburban sacrifice as an associate to Heaven. 56) In his study on the Spirit of the Soil, Chavannes took sides with the exponents of the second opinion. He based his argument on the dis- tinction between the Spirit of the Soil and the Sovereign Earth. The former was a territorial god, restricted in power as to space and time. Chavannes observed that the Duke of Chou has sacrificed to the Spirit of the Soil on the day of mio-woo within the precinct of the new city. As to the Sovereign Earth, he claimed that she had been of a later origin. Consequently, in his opinion, the Duke could not have offered two sacrifices on the day of ting-sze. 57) This is an excellent solution. Unfortunately Chavannes was not fully aware of its significance, thus failing to draw an important consequence. Indeed, if the Spirit of the Soil was a god of territorial groups, then he was comparable to a local magistrate in the Chou administrative system. His function was, therefore, purely administrative. On the other hand, the Sovereign Earth, being the counterpart of Heaven, was an agent of creation. Her function was essentially creative. Hence it appeared that the Spirit of the Soil and the Sovereign Earth differed from one another not only in their respective power as the space and as to time, but also in the function which were assigned to them. They belonged, therefore, to two different systems of cosmological thinking. They were parts of two different religious institutions. The Spirit of the Soil was an essential element in the Chou religion, the Sovereign Earth in the Ch'in-Han religion. It was indeed a particular feature of the Chou religion that it re- presented the spirit world after the model of the Chou administrative system, in which the king held first place and supreme authority. He was assisted in the government of the kingdom by the feudal prin- ces and grand officers. The feudal princes had their states. They were assisted in the government of their states by the grand officers. The grand officers, as well as the common people, had no territory of their own. They were said to live through the favour of the king and the 56) Ibid., p. 423 note. 57) Chavannes, op. cit., passim.</page><page sequence="19">The Notions of God in the Ancient Chinese Religion I 17 feudal princes. A similar hierarchy was found in the world of the spirits. There were, first of all, two Spirits of the Soil with the rank of king. One was put in charge of the affairs of the kingdom. He was honored by a sacrifice at the Grand altar (ta-she). The other was put in charge of the private domain of the king. He was honored at the Royal altar (wang-she). There were then the Spirits of the Soil with the rank of feudal princes. Some of them were in charge of the affairs of the states. Sacrifices made to them were at the altars of the state (kuo-she). Others were incharge of the private domains of the feudal princes and where honored at the altars of the prince (hou-she). Fi- nally, there were the Spirits of the Soil with the rank of officers. The humblest ones were in charge of the territories of the twenty five households. They were sacrificed to at the so-called Appointed altars (chi-she). 58) There were other spirits besides the Spirits of the Soil. These were the Super-intendents of the lot, the Spirits of the central hall, the Spirit of rain from the roofs, the Spirit of the gates of the city wall, the Spirits of the roads leading from the city, the Guardian of the door, and the Guardian of the fire place, etc. These, too, were ranked according to their offices. 59) It is evident that such a representation of the world of spirits could not but bear upon the conception of a Supreme God. The result is noticeable in a conversation carried on between Confucius and a certain Wang-sun Chia. The latter was a great officer in the state of Wei. Compared with the Prince of Wei, he held a lower rank. Still his power was considerable enough to be reckoned with. For practical purposes it was even more expedient to solicit his favour than that of the prince. Seeing that Confucius showed no desire to pay homage to him, he decided to teach him a lesson. To avoid the offense, he adopted a figure of speech, in which he likened himself to the guardian of the fireplace and the Prince to the Spirit of the central hall. Of course, the Guardian of the fireplace held a lower rank in the world of the spirits. But on account the particular office he exercised he was gener- ally believed to be both more accessible and reliable. Thus, Wang-sun Chia asked Confucius cunningly: "What is the meaning of the saying: It is better to pay homage to the Kitchen than to the Central Hall?' To 58) James Legge, S.B.E., vol. 28, pp. 206-207. 59) Ibid., pp. 207-208.</page><page sequence="20">118 Joseph Shih which Confucius replied with his usual resourcefulness: 'Not so.' he said, 'He who offends against Heaven has none to whom he can pray.' " 6o) As the question of Wang-sun Chia reflected the current representation of the world of spirits, so Confucius' reply showed the conception of the Supreme God that was relevant to the mentality of his contemporaries. Two traits of the Supreme God stand out in the above conversation. First, Heaven-the Supreme God of the Chou people-was believed to transcend all other spirits. He, who offended Him, could not pray to the Guardian of the fireplace, nor to the Spirit of the Central Hall, nor to any other spirit. "He has," said Confucius, "none to whom he can pray." Secondly, Heaven was regarded as the sole lawgiver. All the other spirits must exercise their offices according to his law. Hence they could not give refuge to any one, who had offended Heaven. They were bound to punish him. It is interesting to note that, as in the representation of the world of spirits, so too in the conception of the Supreme God, the Chou people modeled their perception after the example of their society. The many spirits were ranked hierarchically as the officers in the Chou administrative system. The Supreme God was pictured as the prototype of the Chou king. The same conception of the Supreme God underlaid the Chou sub- urban sacrifice. To recognize it we must recall that in Shang times there had been two sacrifices to the Supreme God. These were the ti and ting. The ti was held in the open country. Its purpose was to ask for a good year. It is most probably that the suburban sacrifice, described in the Book of Rites under the heading of Yiieh-ling (Pro- ceedings of the government in different months), was of the same nature as this sacrifice. It was indeed offered to God-on-High and apparently for the sake of asking for a good year. 61) Also Henri Masparo saw in it vestiges of an earlier religious practice. 62) In any case it did not refer to the Suburban sacrifice (chiao) in the strict sense which, together with the sacrifice at the altar of the Spirit of the Soil (she), constituted the core of the Chou religious institution. The Suburban sacrifice in the strict sense was the one offered at 60) James Legge. C.C., vol.

The Book of Rites speaks of it with great respect but little precision. However, it is remarkably consistent with regard to two points. First, it states that the victim in the Suburban sacrifice was a single unblemished calf and that it was to be offered by fire. Secondly, it explains that the suburban sacrifice "was a great act of thanksgiving to Heaven," and that "the sun was the chief object considered in it." 63) We shall examine these two points separately. In the Chinese Classics, God-on-High is said to receive the lei sacrifice. 64) Though the exact nature of this sacrifice is hard to define, it is certain that the same sacrifice is said to be offered equally to the Spirits of the Soil and Grain as well as the Higher Ancestors. But this has never been said of Heaven. 65) Heaven, as we know, would receive only the burnt offering of a single unblemished calf. The contrast is significant. It reveals the respective quality of the two concepts of the Supreme God. The Concept of God-on-High was a syncretistic one, in which the transcendency of the Supreme God had been blurred by the shadow of the moon. It was because of his confusion with the moon-god that God-on-High was asked to share the lei sacrifice with the Spirits of the Soil and Grain and with the Higher Ancestors. If Heaven resisted abdicating his transcendency and would not partake of the victims which belonged properly to the lower spirits, it was presumably because the concept of Heaven was still intact. Yet alien from the moon, Heaven was nevertheless likened to the sun. The Book of Rites is explicit in its statement that the sun was the chief object considered in the Suburban sacrifice. Yet the same Book of Rites gives us to understand that, despite the consideration shown to the sun, the notion of Heaven remained unchanged. The robe, the cap, and the carriage of the king all indicated that it was still the sky and not the sun which was the visible form of the invisible Heaven. Indeed, it says that on the day of Suburban sacrifice, "the king assumed the robe with the ascending dragons on it as an emblem of heavens. He wore the cap with the pendants of jade-pearls, to the number of twelve, which is the number of heaven. He rode in the plain carriage, because of its simplicity. From the flag hung twelve pendants, and on 63) James Legge, S.B.E., vol. 27, pp. 416-417. 64) James Legge, C.C., vol.

The answer is to be found through the understanding of the myth concerned, which is related in the famous Canon of Yao (Yao-tien). Yao appears in Ssu-ma Chien's account of the Five Emperors. We have spoken of him as a moon-god. In the Canon of Yao, he is repres- ented rather as a sage king who governed the world with the help of able ministers. These were Hsi and Ho. It is interesting to note that Hsi and Ho appear in the moon mythology as a single person. He is either the mother or the chariot-driver of the sun. 67) In the Canon of Yao, Hsi Ho became four brothers. They were appointed by the Emperor Yao to rule the four ends of the world. Their principal duty was to secure the regular motion of the sun at the four critical moments of its course, namely the two equinoxes and solstices. The Canon of Yao is recorded in the Book of History. It reads as follows: Thereupon Yao commanded Hsi and Ho, in reverent accordance with their observation of the wide heavens, to calculate and with delineate the move- ments and appearances of the sun, the moon, the stars, and the zodiacal spaces; and so to deliver respectifully the seasons to the people. He separately commanded the second brother Hsi to reside at Yu-e, in what was called the Bright Valley, and there respectfully to receive as a guest the rising sun, and to adjust and arrange the labours of the spring... He further commanded the third brother Hsi to reside at Nan-chiao, and arrange the transformations of the summer, and respectfully to observe the extreme limit of the shadow. He separately commanded the second brother Ho to reside at the West, in what was called the Dark Valley, and there arrange the completing labours of the autumn. He further commanded the third brother Ho to reside in the northern region, in what was called the Sombre Capital, and there to adjust and exa- mine the changes of the winter. 68) Two themes seem to be interwoven in this account. The one deals with the solstices. It centers upon the four astrologers, and signifies 66) James Legge, S.B.E., vol. 27, pp. 429-430. 67) Henri Maspero, "Ldgendes mythologiques dans le Chou King, I. la lIgende de Hi et Ho."

III, pp. 18-2o.</page><page sequence="23">The Notions of God in the Ancient Chinese Religion 121 fears, not uncommon to primitive men, that, unless proper rites were performed to stop the sun at the solstices and to turn it back to its course, winter or summer might go on indefinitely getting colder or hotter. 69) The other described the reign of Emperor Yao. It is an accomodated version of a creation myth, in which Yao is represented as a personification of Heaven. Since the Suburban sacrifice was held at the winter solstice, it is hard to dismiss the fear of protracted winter all together as foreign to the thinking of Chou rulers. It was probably in relation to this fear that the sun was considered to be the chief object on this occasion. But the Suburban sacrifice, as a supreme act of a reigning king, was related rather to the creation myth. The Book of Rites defines the nature of the Surburban sacrifice when it states that, by means of the ceremonies performed in the suburb, "the place of Heaven is established," and "all the spirits receive their offices." 70) It was indeed the action of Heaven rather than the motion of the sun as such that was the chief object of the celebration. As a personification of Heaven, Yao represented the ideal of Chinese kingship. Confucius spoke of him with greatest admiration: "Great indeed was Yao as a sovereign! How majestic was he! It is only Heaven that is grand, and only Yao corresponded to It." 71) But, if Heaven was taken as the prototype of Chinese kings, it was because He had been worshipped as the heavenly King. III. T'ai i, THE GREAT ONE: THE LORD OF THE UNIVERSE In late Chou times owing to the introduction of iron Chinese society underwent a rapid technological and economic growth. Cities multiplied as trade became more intense and extensive. But the progress had also the effect of disrupting the cohesion of the traditional society and up- setting its established way of life. Li, the sacrosanct rules of conduct for the Chou aristocrates, no longer held. Instead, economic interests drove the rulers of feudal states to adopt measures that tended solely to accu- mulate wealth and build up military strength. It was the period of 69) Joseph Needham, Science and Civilization in China, vol. 3. (Cambridge, I959), pp. 186-194. 70) James Legge, C.C., vol.

Cheng (259-210 B.C.), the Prince of Ch'in, subdued all China and proclaimed himself Shih-huang-ti, or the First Emperor. But the dynasty of Ch'in hardly survived its first monarch. In 206 B.C., it was replaced by the Han dynasty. Being of humble origin, the founders of the new dynasty had no cultural tradition of their own. They inherited the highly organized bureaucratic administration from the former dynasty, but found it impossible to profess the discredited Legalism of their prodecessors. 73) For some time they wavered be- tween Taoism and confucianism. Their hesitations were obvious in their dealings with the problems of the different orders. These were politically the struggle between the central government and the newly erected feudal states; economically, the debate on the state monopoly of production of salt and iron; and ideologically, the controversy on the respective merits and demerits of government by action and govern- ment by non-action. 74) The issue proved to favour Confucianism which came to be sponsored by the state under the reign of Emperor Wu (140-87 B.C.). A particular feature of Han Confucianism was that it was thorough- ly permeated by the doctrine of the so-called Yin-yang and Five Agents school. It is indeed impossible to grasp the notion of the Supreme God under the Han dynasty without referring to that doc- trine. Therefore, in the following pages we shall first expound briefly the basic tenets of the Yin-yang and Five Agents school and, then, show their influence upon the conception of the Supreme God in the Ch'in-Han religion. Strictly speaking, Yin-yang and Five Agents were names of two theories. One of them, the Yin-yang theory, was yet another instance of syncretism. Indeed, in the cosmogony of the Shang people, earth, represented by the Demon of the Underworld, was believed to be the source of all beings. In that of the Chou, earth, worshipped as the Spirit of the Soil, had no part in the creation of the universe. Creation 72) Edwin O. Riischauer and John K.

Brill, 1931.</page><page sequence="25">The Notions of God in the Ancient Chinese Religion I123 was then attributed to Heaven alone. 75) The Yin-yang theory claimed, however, that both Heaven and earth were agents of creation. We shall illustrate this point by the comparison of two ancient treatises. Let us take first the Book of Lao-tzu, or Tao-Te Ching. It is a kind of metaphysical treatise. Though compiled in the late Chou period, it was based upon a tradition akin to that of the Shang people. The question of creation is treated in several passages of this book. Here are a few examples: "The term Non-being indicates the beginning of heaven and earth; the term Being indicates the mother of the ten thousand things." (chap. I) "Heaven and earth and the ten thousand things are born out of Being; Being is born out of Non-being." (Chap. 40) "One produced two; two produced three; three produced the ten thousand things." (Chap. 41). 76) Though the meaning of the "one", "two", and "three" in the last statement are extremely difficult to determine, the teaching of Lao Tzu on the question of creation seems to be clear. According to him, all beings are derived from one single source which he calls Non-being, or Tao. These are metaphysical con- cepts. To speak mythologically, one should use the term "the Spirit of the Underworld." Indeed, despite Lao Tzu's effort to demythologize the ancient Chinese cosmogony, some traces of early myths are still noticeable in his book, the following being the most important one: The valley spirit never dies; It is a dark female. Her womb was the root of heaven and earth. Hidden as it is, Its productivity is inexhaustible. 77) Now compare this teaching to that of the Appendices to the Book of Changes (or Ten Wings, shih-i) which date from a later age, about the second century before Christ. In them, the creation of the world is described in terms of the eight trigrams (kua), technically known as: ch'ien, k'un, chen, sun, k'an, li, ken, and tui. Paraphrasing a statement of Lao Tzu, which we have just considered, the Appendices state: "In the Book of Changes, there is the Great Ultimate (T'ai-chi), which produced the two Forms (i). The two Forms produced the four 75) James Legge, C.C., vol. IV, p. 541. 76) J. J. L.

K'un is earth and hence is called mother. Chen by its first line is male and so is called the first son. Sun by its first line is female and so is called the first daughter. K'an by its second line is male and so is called the second son. Li by its second line is female and so is called the second daughter. Ken by its third line is male and so is called the third son. Tui by its third line is female and so is called the third daughter. 79) Applied to the natural phenomena, Chen becomes thunder, Sun be- comes rain, k'an becomes water, Li becomes fire, Ken becomes moun- tain, and Tui becomes marsh. To express these diagrammatic represen- t-tions in mythical form, one should say that all things are produced by God Fu-hsi and his sister Goddess Nii-ho. so) But, like the Book of Lao-tzu, the Appendices seek to demythologize the ancient Chinese cosmogony. They abound indeed in such abstract utterances as: "Vast is Ch'ien, the beginner, all things owe to it their beginning. It com- prises Heaven." "Perfect is K'un, the beginner! All things owe to it their birth. It receives obediently the influence of Heaven." 81) It is interesting to compare these statements to that of Lao Tzu: "The term Non-being indicates the beginning of heaven and earth; the term Being indicates the mother of the ten thousand things." By this com- parison, we shall see both the similarity between the two cosmogonic teachings and their difference from each other, realizing thus the specific nature of the Yin-yang teaching. The similarity between the two teachings consists in the distinction of the two categories: Non-being (wu) and Being (yii) on the one hand, on the other hand Ch'ien and k'un. Their difference is found in the order, in which the two categories are arranged in the two schools. According to Lao Tzu, Being is born out of Non-being. The primacy belongs therefore to the latter.

The primacy is attributed rather to the former. The full significance of this distinction will appear if we bear in mind that both the Book of Lao tzu and the Book of Changes ultimately derived from the moon mythology in which Yin excels yang. The Non-being, being equivalent to Yin, rightly holds the primacy. But Ch'ien is a synonym of Yang; how does it exceed K'un which is a synonym of Yin? The answer to this question should lead us to understand the proper nature of the Yin-yang teaching. Indeed, it is true that the Yin-yang theory, as well as Taoism, ultimately derived from the mythology of earliest China. But the use of mythological materials varied in the two cases. In Taoism, ancient myths were restated simply in contemporary language. Its aim was simply to reveal the way of nature and to invite men to follow it. Hence there was no need of reversing the order of Yin and Yang. In the Yin-Yang school, the handling of ancient myths became more complicated. It involved the adaptation of the original intentions to the exigencies of the existing social order, because its aim was to justify and sanction the actual laws by showing their conformity to nature. 82) Now, in the Chinese society the king, the father, and the husband held a higher position respectively in regard to the minis- ter, the son, and the wife. Hence it was necessary that Ch'ien, which symbolized the former, should exceed k'un, which symbolized the latter: 83) This was how the order of Yin and Yang came to be reversed. The Yin-yang theory was, therefore, an instance of syncretism: not only in so far as it blended the Shang and Chou cosmoginies by claiming that both heaven and earth were the principles of creation, but also in so far as it harmonized the Taoist and Confucian views on the respect- 82) This is stated in the Appendices as follows: "Heaven is high, the earth is low. Thus Ch'ien and k'un are determined. In correspondance with the difference between low and high, inferior and superior places are established." cfr. Wilhelm- Baynes, op. cit., p. 3Ol. 83) This is illustrated in the Appendices as follows: "The K'un possesses beauty but veils it. So must a man be when entering the service of a king. He must avoid laying claim to the completed work. This is the way of the earth, the way of the wife, the way of the one who serves. It is the way of the earth to make no display of completed work but rather bring everything to completion vicariously."

The Yin-yang school sought to demonstrate how the traditions of the sage kings conformed to nature and were sanctioned by it. As to the Five Agents theory, unfortunately we have but a faint knowledge of it today. The Grand Historian, Ssu-ma Chien, attributes its spread to the philosopher Tsou Yen (about 305-240 B.C.), and summarizes its tenets in a few lines. On account of the scarcity of pertinent information, we shall reproduce here his text and give it an accurate interpretation. Tsou Yen cited facts to prove that ever since the seperation of heaven and earth the virtues of the Five Agents had been in rotation. He showed how the dynasties in the past had agreed respectively with the virtues of the corresponding Agents, and how the portents that had been given had been really realized. 84) Tsou Yen taught that the events in the human world were influenced by the rotation of the Five Agents, which are: Water, Wood, Metal, Fire, and Earth. Each Agent took its turn to dominate over all the others. As to the order of succession, he said that "each Agent was followed by the one that defeated it." Accordingly, "wood was followed by Metal, Metal by Fire, and Fire by Water." ss5) Each time when one Agent came to prevail, it called up a new dynasty that was to rule by the special virtue of the Agent. Since the succession of one Agent to another was believed to be announced generally by certain portents, it was very important for the rulers, who were engaged in contending for the supremacy, to detect the portents and to conform their institu- tions to the proper virtue of the Agent that was supposed to prevail. Though different from each other originally, the Yin-yang and Five Agents theories did have a certain affinity between them. It was there- fore not a pure accident that they came to be considered as teachings of one single school. A fundamental principle, that underlaid both these theories, is known as T'ien-jen ho-i, which means "perfect corre- spondence between what happens in nature and what happens to men." 84) Shih Chi (Ricord of History) ch. 74 "Biographies of Men Ko and Hsiin Ching." 85) Cited according Fung Yu-lang's Chung Kuo che-hsiieh-shih hsin-pien (re- vised edition of the history of the Chinese philosophy) Peking, 1963, p. 452.</page><page sequence="29">The Notions of God in the Ancient Chinese Religion 127 To some extent, this principle is congenial to the Chinese mentality. It was operative in Taoism and Confucianism as well. Speaking of the conduct of a sage king, Confucius, for example, used the following illustration: "He who exercises government by means of virtue may be compared to the pole-star, which keeps its place while all the other stars turn around it." s86) The particular merit (or demerit) of the Yin-yang and Five Agents school consisted rather in constructing a series of models to foster just such a process of thinking. These models were built upon an astronomical chart, which repre- sents the twenty-eight lunar mansions (hsii) along the celestial equator. It corresponds roughly to a European Chart of the constellations and stars of the northern hemisphere. Taken in its broadest lines, it may be pictured as two circles, one outside the other, having the same pole as their center. The inner circle covers the circumpolar area. 87) The outer circumference represents the celestial equator. The zone between the inner and outer circumferences is divided into four quadrants. These are also called the four palaces, namely the four palaces where the sun sojourns successively in the course of the four seasons. In contrast to these four palaces, the area within the inner circle is known as the central palace. The chief operation of the Yin-yang and Five Agents school was to extend the cardinal point system of the terrestial horizon to the celestial equator. Not suspecting the obliquity of the ecliptic, the ancient Chinese were unaware of the longitudinal movement of the sun. Their de- termination of the four celestial cardinal points was based on principles that were purely conventional. ss) Noting that in winter the night was longer than the day, they thought that the Yin prevailed then over the Yang. Hence they deduced that the sun must be at the North. Accord- 86) James Legge, C.C., Vol. I, p. 145. 87) Unlike the ancient Greek who determined the positions of the sun in the sky through the observation of heliacal risings and settings on the horizon, the ancient Chinese did it through the observation of culmination of the circumpolar stars. The pole was thus the fundamental basis of Chinese astronomy. Cfr. Jo- seph Needham, op. cit., p. 223. 88) The ancient Greek explained the alternation of the seasons by the meteoro- logical cause. They believed that the wind of the North and the wind of the South chased the sun to the African and European sides, like a ballon sailing back and forth along the alternating currents of air. For them therefore, the characteristic of he winter is that the sun is at the south.</page><page sequence="30">I128 Joseph Shih ingly, the quadrant, where the winter solstice takes place, was named the Northern or Winter palace. And the opposite quadrant was called the Southern or Summer palace. Following the same reasoning, one should expect that the Western palace, where the spring equinox takes place, would have been called Spring palace. But it was not so. The Western palace was known as Autumn palace. Instead the Eastern palace was called Spring palace. This incoherence is alluded to in the following passage of the Book of Chou Rites (Chou-li): "In the winter and the summer one directs himself to the sun, in the spring and autumn one directs himself to the moon in order to determine the order of the four seasons." s8) With heaven and earth thus coinciding with one another, it is easy to distribute the Five Agents into the Five Celestial Palaces. Wood should grow in the Spring Palace; Fire should burn in the Summer Palace. Let metal be deposited in the Autumn Palace and Water re- served in the Winter Palace. Earth must remain in the Central Palace. The colour of earth is yellow. It was the colour of the Chinese emperor. Indeed, the territory of China corresponded to the Central Palace, whereas all the other countries occupied regions which corresponded to one of the four other Palaces. 90) But the real interest of such con- structions derived from the fact that the heavens moved in cycles. There were daily cycles, monthly cycles, yearly cycles, and most for- midable of all, dynastic cycles. It was the apprehension of the dynastic cycles that was the cause for the success of the Yin-yang school in Ch'in-Han times. From our point of view, the most interesting thing about these con- structions are, of course, not that they illustrated the principle of "the perfect correspondence between what happens in nature and what happens to men," but that they show the amalgamation of the two systems of religious symbolisms which Heaven and Tao had once embodied. Indeed, with the coalition of heaven and earth, the Under- world was, so to speak, transferred up to heaven. Consequently, dragon, tiger, bird, and tortoise, which had been shaped by the waxing moon to reveal the mysteries of the Underworld, were then plastered on the vault of Heaven and were even identified with individual con- 89) Blot, Ed.

An immediate effect of this new theology on the conception of the Supreme God was the quintuplication of God-on-High. Each of the Five Gods-on-High were said to command the virtues of one of the Five Agents. The Yellow One commands the virtue of Earth; the Green One the virtue of Wood; the Red One the virtue of Fire; the White One the virtue of Metal; and the Black One the virtue of Water. They took turns to prevail one over the other according to the principle of the "mutual production and succession" of the Five Agents. When one of them came to his turn to prevail, he adopted a man as his son and gave to him the mandate to rule the world. As such, he was worshipped at the suburban sacrifice and received the honor that had been formerly reserved for Heaven and God-on-High. Thus, according to one dynastic legend, Kao-tzu, the founder of the Han dynasty, once dreamed of killing a great snake. On that occasion he was informed by a spirit that the snake was the son of the White God-on-High and that he who had killed it, was the son of the Red God-on-High. 92) But in another dynastic legend, the same Kao-tzu is said to have been the son of the Black God-on-High to whom he erected the Northern Sacred Palace. 93) The Historian Pan K'u (32-92 A.D.) remarked, indeed, that the Han emperors had hesitated for several generations about the virtue by which they had obtained the mandate to rule. When they finally reached the decision, their choice was the virtue of Fire. Consequently, Red was adopted as the colour of the Han dynasty. 94) It is evident that such a conception of the Supreme God had great inconveniences; for the Five Agents were applied not only to the succession of time but also to the extension of space.

Thus, the Yellow God-on-High ruled in the Central Palace; the Green God-on-High in the Eastern Palace, the Red God-on-High in the Southern Palace; the White God-on-High in the Western Palace; and the Black God-on-High in the Northern Palace. This led inevitably to the practices of offering sacrifices to all Five Gods-on-High at separate Sacred Palaces. 95) These were strongly objected to by some Confucian officials as incompatible with the tradition of the sage kings. To remedy the abuses a restoration of the pristine Suburban sacri- fice was undertaken. This happened during the reign of the emperor Cheng (the 9th ruler of the dynasty) at the recommendation of his Confucian minister K'ung Hen. But what was restored then, was no longer a single sacrifice to Heaven as the Heavenly King; it was actually a double sacrifice to both Heaven and Earth as two co-ordi- nated agents of creation. Here too the influence of the new theology must be active. We read indeed from the memorial of K'uang Hen such an explanation: "The sage kings did not institute the ceremonies of the Suburban sacrifices casually; the sacrifice to Heaven is to be held at the Southern suburb. Its purpose is to conform to the Yang principle. The sacrifice to Earth is to be held at the Northern suburb. Its purpose is to symbolize the Yin principle." 96) Similar conceptions are also found in the hymns sung at the Han Suburban sacrifices. Here is but one example: Hail the Supreme Principle. Hail the most venerable Goddess You govern heaven and earth Form the four seasons Regulate the sun and moon Moderate the constellations and stars And turn round and round The Yin-yang and Five Agents.97) A final and lasting effect of the Yin-yang theory on the conception of the Supreme God was the exaltation of God T'ai-i.

It had been a name of Tao. 98) As such, it had designated a moon-god. 99) The cult of God T'ai-i had something to do with the pursuit of immortality. It was probably for that purpose that Emperor Wu had been a devotee of this cult. 100oo) But viewed through the models of the Yin-yang school, God T'ai-i came to be visualized by the pole- star. Consequently, he was believed to reside above the pivot of the celestial vault and to act before the separation of heaven and earth. 101) It was then that he was recognized as "the greatest among all heavenly gods," and that the Five Gods-on-High were said to be "no more than the helpers of the Great One." 102) It is interesting to note that before the official institution of the double suburban sacrifice, the sacrifice to God T'ai-i was often coupled with the sacrifice to Sovereign Earth. After the institution of the double suburban sacrifice, His name was still invoked in a hymn addressed to Heaven and Earth as One who was supposed to enjoy the Suburban sacrifice: Dressed in variegated silk, A thousand boys and girls Dance in eight ranks to delight God T'ai-i. 103) All these indicate that in the Han religion God T'ai- is effectively in- stalled on the throne of the Supreme God, left vacant through the quintuplication of God-on-High and the de-personification of Heaven. IV. THE MOON, THE SKY, AND THE POLE-STAR To believe in the Supreme God is one thing; another thing is to con- ceive of Him in a way consistent with one's way of living and thinking. In the pages, that precede, we have shown how the Chinese people had believed in the Supreme God from the very beginning of their history. But their way of conceiving of Him varied throughout the formative period of their nation. 98) "Tao is something that is extremely fine. It can not be seen described nor named.

It was essentially a clan organization. The life of the people centered then around the ancestral temple. The ancestor worship formed indeed the core of their religion and fashioned their views on God, nature and men, as is evident from their iconography and my- thology, in which the moon occupied a pre-eminent place. It was quite natural that God-on-High, their Supreme God, came to be visualized through the moon and was somewhat shadowed by it. The government of Chou China was erected from the federation of several tribal communities, cemented by their common belief in the Supreme God whom they hailed as Heaven. Compared with God-on- High, Heaven was more active in the events of the nation and less bound to the cycle of the seasons. His will was, therefore, more con- scientiously respected. Like God-on-High, He was the lord of nature but, as a prototype of the Chou kings, He was honored above all as the guardian of the moral order, that is, the founder and defender of the Chinese civilization. The rulers of Ch'in-Han dynasties arrogated to themselves the title of emperor (huang-ti) which differed significantly from that of king (wang). A king ruled over a society; he was the guardian of a par- ticular civilization. An emperor governed the whole world; he was responsible not only for civilization but also for creation. The Chinese saying "dew in spring and frost in autumn are nothing but benefits from the emperor" betrays exactly this belief. Hence it is evident that the Supreme God of the Ch'in-Han religion must be the sole universal Lord of the universe. The Five Gods-on-High and the couple Heaven and Earth, were but poor substitutes. They were, more properly speaking, symptoms of a religious metamorphosis and heralds of a coming God - God T'ai-i who, with the pole-star as His image, did appear to be endowed with the necessary qualifications to hold this highest dignity. The moon, the sky, and the pole-star: these were, therefore, the three symbols of the Supreme God used in the ancient Chinese religion. They had been adopted successively and had prevailed one after the other: the moon in the Shang dynasty, the sky in the Chou dynasty, and the pole-star in the Han dynasty. However, a religious symbol dies hard. Once introduced it tends to stay indefinitely and to revive in many guises. Thus, under the Chou dynasty when Heaven had been exalted</page><page sequence="35">The Notions of God in the Ancient Chinese Religion 133 as the Supreme God, God-on-High remained unchanged. It is true that the two were then formally recognized as being one and the same deity. Still, on certain occasions they received distinct sacrifices. Again, un- der the Han dynasty, sacrifices were offered separately to the Five Gods-on-High, to Heaven and Earth, and to God T'ai-i. Yet, at the same time these sacrifices were indifferently identified as sacrifices to Heaven or to God-on-High. Confronted with such evidences, our previous statement ought to be modified. The three symbols of the Supreme God had been adopted successively - but once adopted they were used simultaneously. They had prevailed one after the other - but only to the extent that the predominance of the one did not exclude the continual existence of the other. In other words, the moon, the sky, and the pole-star had been introduced successively into the ancient Chinese religion as the symbols of the Supreme God. But once intro- duced they remained and continued to symbolize one and the same Supreme God. But the simultaneous use of several different symbols of the Su- preme God poses a serious theological problem which can not be dis- missed simply by stating that some of these symbols are "survivals" of earlier forms of religion; for, as E. O. James has observed, "sur- vivals" have survived because there are reasons for their continual existence. 104) Hence, questions are to be raised as to why God-on- High had persisted under the Chou dynasty and why both Heaven and God-on-High had persisted under the Han dynasty. For reasons that shall become clear to us latter one, we shall consider the two questions separately. It seems that there were two reasons for the continual existence of God-on-High in Chou times. The one derived from the nature of the symbolism itself. Owing to the analogy with the moon, God-on-High represented a Supreme God that had revealed Himself particularly as a fertility god. As such, he was more aptly invoked in such occasions as those of asking for good years and posterity; for Heaven, on the other hand, being the prototype of the Chou king, was above all the guardian of the moral order. Chavannes' observation of the constant association between the ancestors and God-on-High was therefore very Io4) History of Religion 2, (London, Hodder and Stoughton, 1964) p. 206.</page><page sequence="36">I34 Joseph Shih pertinent. Unfortunately he neglected the equally important relation be- tween the latter and the fertility of the soil. Otherwise he would not have recurred to that rigid dichotomy of the animistic and naturalistic cults in the ancient Chinese religion. The second reason for the continual existence of God-on-High in Chou times was the uneven cultural change in the Chou society. These were indeed two sharply divided classes in the Chou society. These were, in the words of the philosopher Men Ko (about 372-285 B.C.), those "who labour with their minds" and those "who labour with their strength." The division was then institutionalized by what the same philosopher called "a principle universally recognized," that is: "those who labour with their minds govern others; those who are governed by others are governed by others. Those who are governed by others sup- port them; those who govern others are supported by them." 105) Ac- cordingly, it was quite understandable that Heaven had found readier acceptance by the ruling class, for after all it was to their interest to have the social order thus guaranteed. The people, on the other hand, who had to live by working on the land, continued to be influenced by God-on-High who, as a fertility god, was indeed more significant to them. Thus, side by side with Heaven who was honored principally by the Chou aristocrats, God-on-High came to command the religiosity of the people at large. Perhaps it was not a mere accident that Confucius, whose God was Heaven, was once ridiculed for "not using his two hands and not being able to distinguish the five kinds of grain." 106) The survival of God-on-High in Chou times was a fact easily recog- nizable, for, despite His formal identification with Heaven, He had retained much of His original characteristics. This indeed was possible only because He was still a living God when the apotheosis of Heaven took place. Such however was not the case with Heaven and God-on- High at the moment when the Ch'in-Han religion took shape. Conse- quently, their survival in the new religion was not so readily noticed. Yet we know that under the Han dynasty the Five Gods-on-High re- ceived the suburban sacrifices. Shouldn't this induce us to think that they were in fact Heaven or God-on-High under a new guise? We believe that there are reasons for thinking so. Io5) James Legge, C.C., vol. II, pp. 125-126. io6) James Legge, C.C., vol. I, p. 199.</page><page sequence="37">The Notions of God in the Ancient Chinese Religion 135 Indeed, the Five Gods-on-High were an effect of the Yin-yang and Five Agents theory which had appealed to the Ch'in-Han rulers chiefly owing to its teaching on the dynastical cycles. Now this teaching con- sisted essentially in two notions that purported to define the relation of a secular ruler to the Heavenly God. These were kan-sheng and sheu-ming, namely "to be born though the miraculous influence of God" and "to receive the mandate to rule." It is not difficult to recog- nize that these were precisely what the Shang and Chou kings had claimed for themselves with regard to God-on-High and Heaven. Hence it may be concluded that the Five Gods-on-High fulfilled exact- ly the same function in the Han religion as God-on-High and Heaven had done in the Shang and Chou times. In other words, they were a Han version of God-on-High and Heaven. Compared to the original, the new version had one obvious advan- tage. It was a more comprehensive notion which embodied in itself both the telluric and uranic symbolisms. Thus, unlike Heaven and God- on-High who, though identified with each other, represented however asunder two distinct functions of the Supreme God, the Five Gods- on-High were endowed with necessary qualities both as a fertility God and the guardian of the moral order. Presumably this had a certain part in their ousting of the already fading figures of Heaven and God- on-High. But the new version had also serious drawbacks. We have shown how it had led to the separate sacrifices of all Five Gods-on-High, thus compromising the belief in the unity of the Supreme God. Still, that was a relatively less important defect, for it had been somehow remedied by degrading the Five Gods-on-High to the rank of demiurges and exalting God T'ai-i to the dignity of the One Supreme God. The really disastrous drawback of this notion was its distortion of the meaning of the Mandate of Heaven. As first propounded by the Duke of Chou, the doctrine of the Mandate of Heaven did have a propa- gandistic purpose. But that did not prevent it from deriving its con- tent from a genuine religious experience. In fact, it taught that Heaven was not bound to any particular family. He could give His Mandate to the family, which pleased Him by the virtues of its members, and take it away from the same family whenever it incurred His dis- pleasure. It is easy to recognize that this doctrine is based on the belief in the absolute dominion of the Supreme God revealed through the</page><page sequence="38">I136 Joseph Shih hierophanies of the sky. 107) In the Yin-yang and Five Agents school, however, the Mandate of Heaven was understood otherwise. It was no longer conceived as the expression of a free will but the inexorable consequence of the rotation of the Five Agents, visible in the regular motions of the heavenly bodies. The Five Gods-on-High, whose own supremacy depended on the outcome of such rotation, had of course no say in this matter. But even God T'ai-i would not interfere with this process; for, like the pole-star, He belonged to the world of the motion- less and was supposed to govern by non-action. Thus, the successive rise of the moon, the sky, and the polestar as the symbol of the Supreme God and their simultaneous use in the an- cient Chinese religion have introduced us to the mystery of the names of God. We shall illustrate some aspects of this complicated subject by discussing a few examples mentioned above. Men did not create God. Nor, properly speaking, did they create the notions of God which were prompted in them by whatever of the divine they found within and without themselves. But once a notion of God had been formed, it would be communicated to different per- sons and handed down from one generation to another. To be under- stood and accepted, it would have to be interpreted, illustrated, recon- structed, adapted.., occasionally it would be even falsified so that not all notions of God had the same value. They had to be judged individ- ually each one according to its own merits, above all, its truth, rele- vancy, and adequacy. We tend generally to judge the truth of a notion by comparing it with a similar one which is more familiar to us. To the Christians, for example, the notion of Heaven seems to be true whereas that of the Five Gods-on-High is evidently false, for the former is compatible with the Christian conception of God whereas the latter is contradicted by it. Asked as to how they know that their notion of God is a true one, the Christians would not hesitate to answer that it is because it agrees with the Revelation given in Jesus-Christ. To a certain extent this answer is valid for all religions. Also in the Chinese religion, a notion of God is true so long it derives ultimately from a genuine apprehension of the divine and remains faithful to its content. Judged by this norm, the notion of Heaven, as appears in the doctrine of O107) Cfr. Mirca Eliade Le sacrd et le profane (Collection idles, Paris, Galli- mard, 1965) pp. Ioo-IoI.</page><page sequence="39">The Notions of God in the Ancient Chinese Religion 137 the Mandate of Heaven propounded by the Duke of Chou, is a true notion of God, for it does derive from the genuine perception of the hierophany of the sky in which the Chou people had encountered their Supreme God, and does remain faithful to its original content, namely the belief in his absolute dominion. The notion of the Five Gods-on- High, on the contrary, was a false one. As a new version of Heaven, it derives ultimately also from the sky hierophany. But through its adaptation to the cosmogony of the Yin-yang and Five Agents school it had betrayed their original message. Indeed, as we have shown, the Five Gods-on-High are not absolutely free. They no longer represent the Supreme God that revealed Himself in the form of the sky. The relevancy of the notion of God is seen in its appeal to men. To be so, it must satisfy two necessary conditions. First, it must respond to men's vital interests. Second, it must keep its promise. As personified by the mythical emperor Yao and honored in the Suburban sacrifice, Heaven appeared above all to be the Guardian of the moral order. As such, He responded to the need of those who were interested in maintaining the established order. So, in early Chou times, Heaven was indeed a relevant notion of God to the Chou aristocrats. However, to the mass of people whose only concern was to gain a living through working on the land God-on-High was far more significant. To them Heaven was, therefore, less relevant. Again, in the late Chou period, the Chou order collapsed so that the events denied what Heaven seemed to have promised. Then, it was that Heaven came to be disenchanted and deprived all together of its efficacy as a symbol of God. At the first glance, the adequacy of a notion of God seems to be very different from its relevancy. Heaven, for instance, was a notion of God relevant to the Chou aristocratic society. It was not, however, an adequate notion of God because it represented only one aspect of the divine perfection. But this is not the sense in which we take the word, for we do not refer it to the fact that a notion exhaustes the reality of its object. No notion could ever be adequate in this sense. We refer it rather to the capacity of a notion of God to cope with the religious consciousness of a given society at a definite moment of its history. Taken in this sense, the adequacy of a notion of God is often hardly distinguishable from its relevancy. We shall illus- trate this point with the following example.</page><page sequence="40">138 Shih, The Notions of God in the Ancient Chinese Religion In the early years of the Shang dynasty, when the Chinese society was still relatively homogeneous, God-on-High - being related to Earth as well as to the royal ancestors, and honored both as a ferti- lity God and the Guardian of the moral order - was indeed an adequate expression of the religious consciousness of this society. B3ut the sit- uation did not last. With the rise of the Chou dynasty, God-on-High came to be suspected of partiality because of His alleged affinity to the former royal house. Consequently, He was replaced by Heaven as the Guardian of the moral order. However, He kept his function of a fertility God and, in this capacity, continued to receive the sub- urban sacrifice in the spring and to be honored by the mass of people. We have explained how the continual existence of God-on-High under the Chou dynasty was an effect of the uneven cultural change. This amounts to saying that neither Heaven nor God-on-High could cope with the religious consciousness of the Chou society as a whole, each being relevant only to a part of its population. In other words, neither of them was an adequate notion of God. It is a very significant fact that, already in the formative period of the Chinese empire, neither Heaven nor God-on-High was an ade- quate notion of God any longer. We see in this the main cause for some unpleasant phenomena that plagued particularly the traditional religion of this nation. We refer namely to the phenomena of schism, syncretism, and idolatry. The schism has appeared not only in the different cults fostered by the ruling class and the mass of people, but also in the various ways of conceiving of the Supreme God on the various occasions of the celebration. The syncretism has been evident above all in the simultaneous practice of a variety of forms of religion. Finally, the adolatry has been indulged in by adoring such gods as the Five Gods-on-High, the couple Heaven and Earth, and God T'ai-i, who, having betrayed their original message, have become more the creatures of the human mind than the images of the living God. No one is more aware of these aberrations than the Chinese themselves. Indeed, from Confucius up to the modern iconoclasts and religious reformers, the prophetic words of condemnation have never ceased to be heard.</page></plain_text>
