C.M.C, in Europe. The principal objective of this study was the evaluation of the biofidelity of both dummies according to impact response requirements selected by the IS0/TC22/SC1 2/WG5 experts, these requirements being, at the present the best and most updated technical informations available to assess the biofidelity of a dummy in side impact. The test matrix comprised 40 impactor tests, 75 free fall tests and 7 sled tests. Each dummy region covered by ISO requirements was tested. In this paper the performance of EUROSID and SID dummies are, on the basis of available results, compared with human response data proposed by ISO. INTRODUCTION The biofidelity of a test tool such as an anthropomorphic test dummy is defined by its capacity to reproduce the responses of a human being as faithfully as possible, when this tool is subjected to the same forces. The quality of this reproduction of course depends on the dummy performances as a whole, and also on the performances of its subassemblies or segments. The nearer the response of these subassemblies to human references, the better the overall response of the dummy. Together with repeatabi- lity, sensitivity and reproducibility, biofidelity occupies a special part in the qualitative properties of an impact test dummy. While the first three properties are necessary, as for any test tool, biofidelity is of capital importance. The word "capital" is not exces- sive, since it is necessary to conceive a tool which can first of all -insofar as possible imitate the reactions of the occupant of an automobile during an accident precisely, to offer the best possible protection to the occupant. To ensure and evaluate this essential characteristic of a dummy in the side impact mode, such biomechanical impact work has already been performed throughout the world. This work consisted either of basic experi- ments with varied human substitutes, or was based on the inherent design of the dummy. One of the most important programs that can be mentioned was the "EEC Comparison Testing of Four Side Impact Dummies" program, which was performed between 1978 and 1982 by four European laboratories, and which consisted in evaluation of biofidelity -but also other characteristics for four side impact dummies, the APROD 82, the DOT/SID, the MIRA and the ONSER 50 (1)*. The conclusions of this program (2) have shown that none of the above-mentioned dummies, nor even their components, offered a sufficient degree of development to be usable for a test regulation procedure. In particu- lar, one of the main conclusions concerned the reference data which were used for biofidelity evaluation for each dummy. The data were either insufficient, not updated, or difficult to exploit (1)*. This led to one of the main tasks of the IS0/TC22/SC1 2/WG5 group which, since 1983, has assembled, analysed and discussed available human data to enable evaluation of the biofidelity of a side impact dummy. This work resulted in a synthesis report drawn up by H . Mertz, President of WG5, which was initially approved by the group members, and then by subcommi tte SCI 2, during its recent meeting in November 1987. The data contained in this report represent the best available and most up to date data for the evaluation of dummy segment biofidelity, i.e. * Numbers in parentheses designate references at the end of the paper. 4.1182 0096-736X/89/9704-1 1 82$02.50 Copyright 1989 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">881717 the head, the neck, the thorax, the shoulder, the abdomen and the pelvis (3). These data are not the best in absolute since the violence of the tests selected mTght not be necessary representative of real -world accidents. It was on the basis of these data, which were unanimously recognized by the ISO experts, that the Commi tte of Common Market Automobile Constructor (C. C.M.C.) decided, in March 1987, to conduct a comparative evaluat- ion program, in Europe, on the two existing side impact dummies, the SID, or SIDE IMPACT DUMMY and the EUROSID, or the EUROPEAN SIDE IMPACT DUMMY respecti vely . The first dummy was developed by NHTSA (4, 5), and the second by European Research Laboratories, under the guidance of the EEVC (6, 7). This program is intented to contribute to discussions concerning future harmonization on the part of the U.S.A. and Europe, in the matter of regulations concerning side impact. The EUROSID dummy used in this program corresponds to the first series, known as the production prototype, which became available in July 1987. Availability of the SID dummy, however, gave rise to delivery time problems. In fact, this dummy was not received until February 1988. The goal of the investigation, reported here, has been to make a comparison between the EUROSID and US SID with the ISO requirements as the primary reference. During this work shortcomings of various kind in the dummies and the ISO requirements have been detected. It is outside the scope and ressources for this paper to present detailed accounts of these findings. They will, however, be mentioned, where appropriate in the text. TEST MATRIX - The test matrix resuming the C. C.M.C, evaluation program is given in table 1. As can be seen from the table, all the body segments concerned by the ISO data, as described in the Documents ISO/DTR 9790-1 through 9790-6, are covered by this program. However, all tests required by ISO were not carried out. It can be noted that for segments, such as the neck, the thorax and the pelvis three different test configurations are respectively proposed. As far as the neck is concerned, the sled test described in the requirement No. 2 in Document DTR 9790-2 (8) was not selected since the test violence was considered similar to that defined in the requirement No. 1. Preference was than given to sled tests corresponding respectively to requirements No. 1 and No. 3, where the maximum input sled deceleration differs significantly, i.e. from 7 G to 13 G (see table 1). Sled tests proposed for the evaluation of the dummy thorax -which also relate to the pelvic segment- described in requirement No. 2 in Document DTR 9790-3 (9) were not performed so as not to overweight the contents of the test matrix. For each dummy, the same test in a given configuration was duplicated five times except, due to their complexity, for the lateral neck bending tests. The following tests, not including the pretests, were conducted with both dummies : - 35 fall tests. involving the head, - 7 sled tests involving the neck, - 10 fall tests and ten others with an impactor involving the thorax, - 10 impactor tests involving the shoulder, - 20 fall tests concerning the abdomen, - and 20 impactor tests involving the pelvis. It is the first time where both EUROSID and SID dummies are evaluated in terms of biofidelity on the basis of the same biomechanical reference. ISO requirements, as they are formulated, define limit ranges or corridors as a function of time to assess the dummy performance. For a given test configuration, involving a given dummy segment, the dummy response might be or not within the requirement. There is no doubt about the biofidelity of this dummy segment if its response is within the ISO requirement. On the contrary, and if the response is slightly higher or lesser, or slightly outside the requirement, a statement such as "not acceptable biofidelity" may appear in this case too severe. Therefore a qualitative ranking of the biofidelity of the dummy could be useful 1, in order to avoid too exclusive judgement. Three "classes of biofidelity" which will be used in the conclusions of this study, are proposed as follows : - Class A : Excellent biofidelity of the considered segment ; means that the dummy response is within the requirement. - Class B : The biodifelity of the segment needs improvement. The dummy response is here slightly above or below the requirement. - Class C : Not acceptable. The dummy response is far away from the requirement. Whenever this proved necessary, the raw data for the dummy were normalized in accordance with the procedures described in reference (3). So as to enable the most complete evaluation possible of the biofidelity of both dummies, the various measurement configurations proper to each type of test, for the most part, comprised a higher number of recording channels than that required by ISO. Table 2 provides a brief description of this measurement system. In the following sections, performances of EUROSID and SID are compared. For each body region, the results in terms of time responses are presented. To make the presentation of the paper as clear as possible, peak values obtain- ed from each test series were assembled in tables at the end of the paper. 4.1183</page><page sequence="3">A brief description of test set-ups and normalization procedure, as suggested by ISO, are proposed for each dummy segment evaluation. DUMMY HEAD PERFORMANCES During the program, the biofidelity of the head segment was evaluated on the basis of two types of response specifications recommended by ISO (10). The first specification was formulat- ed from rigid surface tests performed by Hodgson (11) on cadavers. The second refers to free falls onto a padded surface, performed by the APR, and also on cadavers (12). Both specifications recommend a simple free fall test in which only the head of the dummy is involved. TEST AND MEASUREMENT CONDITIONS - The dummy's head was suspended above the impacting surface, at a height of 200 mm, and 1200 mm respectively for specifications No. 1 and No. 2 (10). This height was defined by the distance between the surface to be impacted and the lowest point of the head. The head was oriented to an angle of 35° with respect to the horizontal, and 10° in the second. During the first specification tests, a 50 mm thick dry clean steel plate formed the rigid impact surface, while, for the second specification test, this plate was covered with a thin sheet of 5 mm thick padding (figure 1). A quick- release mechanism was used to ensure the head drops. The instrumentation used comprised equipment for measurement of acceleration at the head c of g, in both evaluation cases. For the tests reproducing the Hodgson condition (11), the head was, in addition, equipped with a sensor for measurement of acceleration of a point of the head located opposite the impact point. All the measurement channels were class CFC 1000 filtered. For the tests involving falling onto a slightly absorbent or damped surface, we considered it interesting to compare the response of the dummy head when the latter was guided or not during the fall, or when a complete dummy was used. The test conditions, the number of tests performed and the measure- ments are given in table 3. The results obtained using the EUR0SID dummy are commented upon below. EUR0SID AND SID HEAD RESPONSES TO RIGID IMPACT - The results show that responses of EUR0SID and SID heads are higher with respect to the upper limit of the cadaver corridor. As can be seen from table 4, the EUR0SID cadaver difference is of the order of 28 % for the maximum resultant acceleration of the point of the non-impacted side. This difference appears, however, to be much higher in the case of the SID dummy, where a ratio of 2 between the cadaver upper limit and the SID can be observ- ed. One can note that the resultant accelera- tion of the head e.g. in EUR0SID tests -this parameter being not covered by ISO specificat- ion- is nearer the reference corridor. A very short impact duration, i.e. nearly 3 ms, is obtained from EUR0SID and SID head accelerations as can be seen from figure 2. EUR0SID AND SID RESPONSES TO DAMPED IMPACT - As previously mentioned, three series of five tests, for a given fall height, were respectively performed with the EUR0SID dummy : with the head alone in free fall, with the head in guided fall and, lastly, with the complete dummy, in which impact of course concerned the head only. The SID dummy was also subjected to these test series, except for the second one. Throughout this chapter, the responses of the EUR0SID and SID heads are compared, on the one hand, to these different configurations, and on the other, to the characteri sties of response defined by ISO (10). Here, we should note that it is the resultant acceleration at the head c of g which enables an opinion to be formed concerning the biofidelity of the head segment. First of all, it can be observed according to the configuration tested, that the resultant acceleration of the EUR0SID head c of g varies, but in insignificant proportions. Between free fall and guided fall, values of 400 g and 395 g are respectively noted, i.e. a difference of 1 % (figure 3). This difference reaches 7 % when compared to free fall, and the same test with the complete dummy. Since these involve dispersions within each series, table 5, the best repeatability is observed for the guided fall with a coefficient variation of 0.8 %, respectively followed by free fall with the head only, with 1.8 %, and fall with the whole dummy, which gives a coefficient of variation of 2,8 %. As far as the SID dummy is concerned, the difference between the simple free fall and the same test with the whole dummy reaches 13 %. The repeatability of the SID head response does not vary significantly with the test configuration. As far as the biofidelity of the EUR0SID and SID heads are concerned, responses observed are located, whatever the configuration chosen, beyond the interval proposed by ISO. Acceleration of the EUR0SID head is, in fact, equal to 1.4 - 1.5 times the upper limit of this interval, while that of the SID head shows a coefficient of 1.2. This is probably due to the important stiffness of the parietotemporal region of both dummy heads, which causes a very brief acceleration pulse. As can be seen from figure 4, the response of cadavers (12) is represented by a bi modal curve, with a duration of 5 ms, while those of EUR0SID and SID show respectively a single high frequency peak with an approximate duration of 3 ms. To summarize EUR0SID/SID comparison, the responses of both dummies are compared in figure 5 to the corridor suggested by ISO (10). 4.1184</page><page sequence="4">881717 Figure 1.

Two response characteristics were selected to judge the biofidelity of the EUROSID and SID necks respectively within the framework of this program. The first originates from volunteer tests conducted by Ewing et al. (13) and the second from experiments with cadavers performed by A.P.R. (14). Both characteristics require duplication of volunteer tests or cadaver tests, according to a sled test configuration. The cadaver tests were generally conducted at a higher test severity than were the human volunteer exposures. TESTS SET-UP AND INSTRUMENTATION - The test set-up used here complies with the descriptions given in the reference (8). The dummy, seated on a chair attached to the sled in the upright position, was restrained by a harness system at the thorax, and by a Vee-type belt at the pelvis. The shoulder and hip of the dummy were wedged against a vertical side wall. The anteroposterior axis of the head of the dummy was horizontal. Starting from this initial position, the dummy was submitted to a deceleration pulse applied to the sled. The object of both response characteristics is to evaluate the kinematic of the head and that of the base of the neck, with respect to the sled. In measurement terms, the dummy was equipped with accelerometers, at the head, at T1 , at T4 and at the pelvis. Two other sensors were provided for measurement of seat and sled decelerations. In particular, the head instrumentation consisted of a 15 accelerome- tric channel configuration developed by APR for calculation of dynamic reactions at the head- neck joint, i.e. at the occipital condyles. Photographic targets were used to evaluate head rotations and its movements -and those of T1-. The filtering classes for the various measure- ments were as follows : - head acceleration : CFC 1000, - acceleration at TI , T4, pelvis, seat and sled : CFC 180, - cinematographic data : these data, obtained from 5 high speed cameras, were processed at time intervals of 2 ms, between two points and according to a three-dimentional film analysis method. In conformance with the above-mentioned conditions, three tests were performed with the EUROSID and four with the SID. An illustration of the test conditions is given in figure 6. A summary of head kinematical responses as required in ISO document DTR 9790-2 No. 1 is proposed in figure 7. EUROSID AND SID NECK RESPONSES IN LOW G-LEVEL SLED TESTS - The results of these tests are resumed in tables 6 and 7. For similar initial conditions, a higher thorax accelerat- ion is observed for the SID dummy, i.e. 19.5 G against 13.1 G for the EUROSID. The sled deceleration time curves are given in figure 8, where an adequate reproduction of the volunteer reference condition can be noted. As far as the acceleration at T1 (13) is concerned, see figure 9, both dummies seem to satisfy the required limits. The SID dummy response, with a first peak clearly ahead of that of the EUROSID, is in the bottom half of response interval 12 G - 18 G, while that of the EUROSID reaches the bottom limit of this interval. As far as head e.g. accelerations are concerned, EUROSID and SID responses are slightly outside specified limits. In lateral direction we can note for EUROSID and SID an acceleration of the head e.g. respectively of 13 G and 14G(volunteer upper limit = 11 G). As shown in table 6, the vertical acceleration of the head e.g. shows in EUROSID and SID tests respectively a lesser and a higher magnitude than the required limits. The kinematic of the base of the neck is shown in figure 10 by horizontal displacement of T1 with respect to the sled. The EUROSID response meets the requirement and ; the SID response is less than the limit (lower) of the volunteer, and takes place later than that of the EUROSID. Reasoning on the basis of the data of figure 9 and 10, it can be seen that the behaviour of the upper thoracic column-shoulder system is different from one dummy to the other in this type of sled test. Therefore, for the EUROSID dummy, the displacement and acceleration of T1 reach their respective maxima approximately at the same moment -between 68 and 75 ms- while, with the SID, there is an inertial peak on T1 at 30 ms, which leads greatly with respect to the displacement of the top column, which takes place at 124 ms. One of the important characteristics of the dummy neck, in terms of biofidelity, is its capacity to induce a head kinematic, i.e. in terms of linear and angular displacements, close to that of the human references. The response characteristics required in the ISO reference (8), even if these enable a pinpoint evaluation of neck performances, do not give explicit specifications concerning the behaviour of the kinematic parameters of the head as a function of time. It is for this reason that hereafter, we have expressed the neck responses in terms of the trajectory of the head center of gravity -vertical displace- ment as a function of horizontal displacement. Head rotations, i.e. the lateral flexion and the torsion are expressed respectively as a function of time. As far as the trajectory of the head c of g with respect to T1 is concerned, the EUROSID response seems to be closer to the specifica- tions, since it is located within the volunteer response envelope, as can be seen from figure 11.

The head trajectory also can be used to judge the flexibility or stiffness of the lower pivot of the dummy's neck. The looser this pivot, the higher the trajectory amplitude. The data of figure 11 indicate that the lower pivot of the SID neçk is stiff er than that of the EUROSID. The head rotations, expressed with respect to T1 , are shown in figure 12, with a volunteer response range for torsion and lateral flexion such as suggested by the data of the ISO document (8). First of all, for EUROSID, it can be seen that lateral flexion, with an amplitude of 57°, is well within the required interval of 44°-59°, while the SID is far from this, with a maximum of 31°. As far as head twist is concerned, the amplitudes of this rotation for both dummies are much lesser than the boundary of the volunter response, i.e. 32°. If it is considered that the amplitude of rotation of the dummy head for lateral bending depends on the stiffness of the upper pivot of the neck -head/neck junction-, it can be seen from figure 12a that the pivot for EUROSID is as flexible as the SID, since it enables a head flexion almost twice as great (in reality, the ratio is 1.8). To conclude, the comparison of the two dummies in terms of neck performances in low G-level sled tests, the head maximum excursion duration is given in figure 13. Given the offset in time of the zero instant of the volunteer reference data (13), of the order of 50 ms, the head excursion duration parameter has been corrected for both dummies. This shows that the SID, with a duration of 155 ms, is slightly below the required interval of 159-177 ms, while the EUROSID gives a satisfactory response, i.e. 175 ms. EUROSID AND SID NECK RESPONSE IN HIGH G-LEVEL TESTS - In table 6 and 7 are summariz- ed the maximum accelerometri c and kinematic responses obtained respectively from EUROSID and SID tests. Two tests were selected for comparison purpose, i.e. No. 1844 and No. 1925 involving respectively the EUROSID and the SID. The corresponding responses vs. time are presented in this section. In figures 14 and 15 are plotted the lateral acceleration time- history respectively of the head and of the dummy's upper thoracic spine T1 . It appears that the EUROSID meets the T1 acceleration requirement, while the SID response is higher. Both dummy responses vs. time are slightly outside the T1 acceleration profile require- ments as shown in figure 15. In this type of test, the trajectory of the head e.g. presents a circular shape as shown in figure 16, where EUROSID and SID responses are compared to ISO requirement. It can be observed that EUROSID head lateral displacement is close to the upper limit of the cadaver response, the SID response magnitude being slightly higher. As far as head angular displacements are concerned, both dummies meet the requirement as illustrated by figure 17, where the flexion angle time-history is plotted. Both dummy responses fail however the torsion angle required. Finally as shown in table 6, none of the dummies meets the head acceleration requirement, i.e. between 25 and 47 G. !

Head flexion angle vs. time obtained from high G-level sled tests - EUROSID and SID responses compared with ISO requirement DUMMY SHOULDER PERFORMANCES Evaluation of the biofidelity of the shoulder segment consists in a side impact centered on the shoulder joint, with an impactor of 23.4 kg and a velocity of between 4.4 and 4.6 m/s. The response characteristics of the shoulder, as defined by ISO in document DTR 9790-4 (15) were obtained from impactor tests conducted with cadavers by APR (16). Shoulder requirements comprise a corridor as a function of time of the impactor normalized load and two limits of the normalized shoulder deflection relative to the spine. The ISO specifications (14) also recommend that the dummy's shoulder biofidelity has to be evaluated on the basis of displacement of the base of the neck obtained in sled tests conducted with volunteers. TEST SET-UP AND INSTRUMENTATION - The dummy was seated in an upright position on flat, rigid surface. The seating surface, with no back support, was clean. A linearly guided impactor, with a mass of 23.4 kg, was used to strike the dummy shoulder. The impactor axis was perpendicular to the dummy's midsagittal plane. In EUROSID tests the impactor axis was aligned with the axis of the left upper arm joint. This dummy was used without its suit. In Sid tests, the dummy with its suit was positioned so that the impactor was centered on the foam block simulating the shoulder, without interference with the dummy rib cage. Figure 18 illustrates the test set-up used for EUROSID and SID. Measurements comprised for both dummies the acceleration respectively of the impactor and of the upper spine T1 . These data were filtered according to class CFC 180. The required CFC 1000 filter, which was also used, showed high-frequency vibration respon- ses. For both dummies the relative shoulder deflection was measured from high speed film. According to the test set-up mentioned above five tests were performed with each dummy. EUROSID AND SID SHOULDER RESPONSES IN IMPACTOR TESTS - The principal results obtained with EUROSID and SID dummies are given in table 8, in which adequate repeatability of these tests, in terms of impact velocity can be noted. Normalized shoulder responses are given in table 9. The values of the effective mass Me appear to be similar for both dummies. This leads to normalizing factor values, which are close to each other, i.e. between 1.034 and 1.053, and 1.025 and 1.086 respectively for EUROSID and SID. Therefore the normalization procedure seems in this case to have a small effect when applied to original data (see tables 8 and 9). Curves representing the T1 acceleration vs. time of both dummies are shown in figure 19. This spine response differentia- tes well between dummy behaviours. While EUROSID T1 response grows rapidly after the first instant of impact, the SID response presents a low acceleration level, followed by a higher increasing of its magnitude. In figure 20 the time-histories of the normalized impactor force are compared to the ISO requirement corridor. The EUROSID response is well within the requirement, with peaks slightly exceeding the top of this corridor. The SID response is completly outside the corridor and achieves its maximum later than that of the EUROSID as shown in figure 20. The relative deflection of the dummy shoulder was measured from the film, with a processing frequency around CFC 60 (Channel Frequency Class). As shown in figure 21, both dummies fail the ISO requirement, the limits of which are respectively 34 and 41 mm. The response of EUROSID is two times higher than the upper limit of the requirement and that of the SID is almost four times higher. As mentioned previously, ISO in reference (15) suggests to use the T1 lateral displacement obtained in volunteer sled tests (13) as additional requirement for the dummy shoulder. We have seen in chapter "Dummy neck performances" that the maximum lateral displacement of T1 in EUROSID test is closer to the volunteer limit range than that of the SID, as shown in figure 10. This last result is consistent with those related to the normalized shoulder force obtained in impactor tests. In fact, the SID shoulder force in impactor tests and the T1 lateral displacement in the sled test achieve respectively their maxima later than those of the EUROSID. The compatibility between the T1 displacement and the shoulder relative deflection requirements is however 4.1192</page><page sequence="12">881717 questionable. On the one hand, these requirements were defined on the basis of different human surrogates, i.e. volunteers and cadavers respecti vely, and on the other hand the EUROSID meets the first requirement and fails the second.

Two characteristics were retained for this program, the first (No. 1) corresponding to free fall tests from heights of 1 and 2 m (17), and the second (No. 3) to impactor type tests (18). Both these types of experiments were performed with cadavers in which the impact concerned the thorax without interference with the subject's arm. The impact velocities are 4.4 and 6.2 m/s for falls and 4.3 m/s for the test configura- tion using the impactor. It should also be remembered that the impact surface for falls (17) is rigid for the first condition and padded for the second. The padding used, was a 140 X 140 X 120 mm block of open cell urethane foam, known as APR padding. The dummy performances must be drawn up according to the following responses : - for the drop tests : the normalized thoracic force and the normalized deflection of the ribs. The normalization procedure is based here on the calculation of the effective mass, using the impact velocity (19), - for the tests with the impactor : the normalized accelerations vs. time of respec- tively T1 and the impactor. The corresponding original data have to be filtered using the 100 Hz Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter. TESTS AND MEASUREMENT CONDITIONS - - Fall tests : The dummy was suspended above the impact surface with its midsagittal plane horizontal. Two dynamometr i c balances, respectively placed opposite the thorax and the pelvis, were provided for force measure- ments. For the EUROSID, the instrumentation comprised the deflections and accelerations for the three ribs, together with accelerations of the pelvis and T12. For the SID dummy, the same measurements were provided, but with a smaller number of channels. The accelerations, deflections and thoracic or pelvic forces were respectively CFC 180 and CFC 1000 filtered. A quick release device was used to allow the dummy to drop freely. In EUROSID tests, the dummy arms were rotated forward and upward in order to prevent any contact with the thoracic loading surface. The EUROSID was used with its rubber suit and the SID dummy was used without its outer skin in order to allow a direct impact to the rib cage. Figure 22 illustrates tests conditions used in EUROSID and SID tests. According to the test set-up described above, five tests were conducted with each dummy respectively with 1 m and 2 m drop heights. - Impactor tests : The dummy was seated in an upright position on a flat and rigid surface without back support. The centerline of the impactor, perpendicular to the dummy's mid- sagittal plane, was centered on the middle rib in EUROSID tests and on the rib structure in SID tests. Both dummies were used without their outer skins. The EUROSID dummy was used with the left arm raised so that its thorax was impacted directly, as shown in figure 23. The same impactor was used as for the shoulder impacts. The dummy instrumentation was similar to that mentioned above. In addition, the impactor and thoracic spine accelerations were measured at Tl. In order to satisfy the filtering specifications recommended in the document (9), the accele- rations were filtered using the FIR procedure available in a processing data program developed by Langdon (20). This also applied to the ribs and T12 accelerations. In fact, we considered it interesting to provide a sufficient number of measurements to enable comparison of the various thoracic lesion criteria, i.e. the T.T.I, or Thoracic Trauma Index, the V.C. or Viscous Criterion and C or thoracic deflection. According to this test set-up five tests were carried out with each dummy. EUROSID AND SID RESPONSES IN RIGID DROP TESTS - Preliminary fall tests from one meter onto a rigid surface, performed with the EUROSID dummy, highlighted a problem concerning measurement of thoracic deflection. In fact, it appeared that the deflection versus time curve did not return to value zero at the end of the impact, but showed a constant positive or negative value as illustrated in figure 24. During subsequent tests, the same phenomenon occured, but with even higher offsets. Knowing that this problem did not occur with the impactor configuration -where the direction of impact was perfectly aligned with the axis of the median rib, one of the probable causes was vibration due to shock of the optical head of the EUROSID thorax instrumentation. We there- fore tried to reduce these vibrations by reinforcing the optical attachment to the thoracic column. Unfortunately, this improvement revealed itself insufficient, although during the calibration test configuration -in which a free falling guided mass hits a rib module (21), the "offsets" of the deflection curve mentioned above were not observed. The investigations conducted show state that this problem was also due to rotational movement of the piston connecting the rib to the EUROSID thoracic column. The anti -rotation device used for this purpose proved insufficient (21), any angular movement of the piston generally resulted in a modification of the focal length between the optical head and the gribs attached to the piston. This resulted in disturbances on the signal sent and there- fore reading errors. These remarks, imputable to experience, do not, of course, suffice to define the problem ; this is caused by other reasons. 4.1195</page><page sequence="15">Results obtained with EUROSID and SID are presented below. The EUROSID tests, where the data were affected by this unusual deflection behavior, were not retained. The EUROSID data, given here, came from a recently performed test series, where rib deflections were measured by means of potentiometers. Table 10 summarizes the results obtained in terms of thoracic impact load, rib and spine accelerations, as well as rib deflections. Maximum values of respectively the normalized thoracic load and the normalized rib deflections feature in table 11. It will be noted that these data were normalized using an effective mass based on the initial impact velocity (19). It appears that, in SID tests, this mass shows values which are close to the standard effective mass of a 50th percentile subject, i.e. 38 kg ; in the EUROSID tests a value close to 32 kg was obtained for the effective mass Me. Therefore, as shown in table 10, the normalization procedure has a small effect on SID and EUROSID responses respecti vely . In figure 25 EUROSID and SID responses vs. time in terms of normalized thoracic load are compared with ISO requirements. Both dummy responses have pulse durations shorter than that of the cadaver corridor. The response of the EUROSID seems to be satisfactory, while that of the SID exceeds the limits of the corridor. The comparison of dummy normalized rib deflections with the requirement, see figure 26, shows that the SID response is slightly higher -about 8 up to 15 %- than the upper limit of the cadaver response. In EUROSID tests, the maximum deflection of the middle rib is about 33 % higher than the requirement. The rib deflection has not the same sense for both dummies. As shown in figure 26, the EUROSID rib cage achieves its maximum deflection much earlier than that of SID and occurs just before the instant where the thoracic load achieves its maximum. In SID tests, the peak rib deflection takes place much latter than that of the thoracic load. This could be explained by a rotation of the rib cage of this dummy during the impact. EUROSID AND SID RESPONSES IN PADDED DROP TESTS - The main results obtained in these 2 m drop tests are given in table 12. The maximum normalized thoracic load and normalized rib deflections are shown in table 13. Compared to data obtained from 1 m rigid drop tests, the SID dummy thoracic load shows a lesser magnitude due to effect of the padding. In figure 27, the normalized thoracic load vs. time of both dummies is compared to the cadaver corridor. Both dummy responses can be consider- ed as satisfactory, with pulse durations slightly longer than the cadaver response. The short duration peaks observed in SID thoracic load time-histories are due to the impact of the head, which occurred latter than the initial thorax-load platform impact. The padding appears to reduce differences between dummy responses. Rib deflections for EUROSID and SID are also close to the requirement, as shown in figure 28, where time-histories of this response were plotted. Here the SID response is well within the required limits. EUROSID AND SID RESPONSES IN IMPACTOR TESTS - The results are given in table 14. The peak values of dummy required responses are expressed according respectively to CFC 180 and FIR 100 filters. A reasonable repeatability for all parameters can be observed. The lateral rib acceleration in EUROSID tests shows significa- tive differences between the upper and lower ribs, while the maximum rib deflection is almost equivalent for the three ribs. The reductive effect of the FIR filtering, on dummy responses, seems to be more important in the case of EUROSID as shown in table 14. The maximum V.C. in EUROSID tests appears to be much higher than that in SID tests. The TTI shows similar values for both dummies. The impactor and spine accelerations vs. time were normalized for both dummies (see table 15). The comparison of dummy responses with ISO require- ments is illustrated in figures 29 and 30. It appears that both dummy responses exceed the impactor and T1 acceleration corridors respectively. Figure 22.

For fall heights of 1 and 2 m, Mertz normalized the cadaver responses, and proposed three parameters to judge the biofidelity of the dummy's abdomen, defined as follows (22) : - acceleration of the 9th rib, - acceleration of the thoracic column, - force due to abdomen-armrest impact. For each impact velocity, response intervals are stipulated for the first two parameters and a force-time corridor for the third. To this, a requirement concerning penetration of the abdomen, which must be at least equal to the height of the armrest, must be added. TEST SET-UP AND INSTRUMENTATION - The dummy was suspended above the impact surface with its median sagittal plane horizontal. The dummy was placed so that the armrest was centered on the abdominal region. For the EUROSID, which is specially equipped to measure side forces -conversaly to the SID- this armrest was centered along the central leaf spring axis, forming what is known as the switch. For SID, the position of the armrest corresponded to the abdomen transverse plane of symmetry. This position of the armrest with relation to the dummy differed with respect to ISO recommendations, in which the impact also concerns the 9th rib. If an alignment such as this had been reproduced, a major part of the abdomen would not have been solicited in the case of the EUROSID. Moreover, this choice of armrest position was above all imposed by the anthropometry of the dummy's abdomen, which in terms of height, is much different than that of the human being. Measurements specified for both dummies comprised acceleration of the bottom rib and the thoracic column on T12, together with a dynamometric balance located under the armrest. As far as the EUROSID is concerned, the abdominal switches were connected to determine if the lesion critical threshold -detectable by this dummy- had been exceeded or not. All the data recorded were filtered to class CFC 600, except for signals obtained from the switches, which were not filtered. The test system was completed by a high-speed camera for measurement of abdominal intrusion. Five tests were conducted respectively with EUROSID and SID and for each fall height, in complian- ce with the conditions described above (see figure 31 ) . EUROSID AND SID RESPONSES IN DROP TESTS - The dummy data were normalized accord- ing to the procedure described in (22), in which three normalizing factors, were calculated for the force, acceleration and time, respectively annotated Rf, Ra and Rt. Results obtained before and after this normalization process are given respectively in tables 16 and 17 for tests with 1 m drop height and in tables 18 and 19 for 2 m drop tests. It appears that the effective mass Me, obtained from SID tests, show a very small value i.e. of 0.88 kg, when compared to that of the 50th percentile standard subject (14.6 kg). This leads to no-obvious values of normalizing factors for force and accelerat- ion. Thus, the maximum lateral rib and spine accelerations of SID dummy are reduced about four times, while the abdominal load is increased in the same ratio. This effect is also observed in the results obtained from 2 m drop tests, as shown in tables 18 and 19. Therefore the normalization procedure, when applied to such a summy segment, is questiona- ble. As far as the EUROSID is concerned, the normalization procedure does not affect so much its original data because the EUROSID abdomen section was built for lateral impact, and its design is different from that of the SID abdomen (Part 572 section). EUROSID and SID normalized responses vs. time are compared with ISO requirements in figures 32 up to 37. One can observe that, in 1 m drop tests, the spine and rib accelera- tions are, for EUROSID, higher than the required limits ; the same parameters exceed the cadaver responses in 2m drop tests. Whatever impact conditions, the SID normalized responses appear to be much lesser than those required by ISO. The comparison of SID original responses with the same human reference does not show better results, except for the maximum lateral rib acceleration, which appears to be close to the cadaver in 1 m drop tests (see table 16). The EUROSID dummy shows, in both impact conditions, a stiff behavior in terms of normalized abdominal load. This dummy response is considerably too high when compared with ISO corridors, as shown in figures 34 and 37. Maximum abdominal penetration seems to agree with the minimum required -41 mm- since this value, which is the height of the impacted armrest, has been reached in all dummy tests. The abdominal deflection bottomed out in all EUROSID tests. 4.1201</page><page sequence="21">Figure 31. Test set-up used in drop tests involving the abdomen Figure 32.

Normalized abdominal load vs. time obtained from 2 m rigid drop tests involving the abdomen - EUROSID and SID responses compared with the cadaver corridor DUMMY PELVIS PERFORMANCES For evaluation of this segment, ISO proposes three types of response characteris- tics. One of these was retained for this program ; the corresponding data were obtained from impactor tests performed by INRETS with cadavers (24) (25). The biofidelity of the pelvis is judged here on the basis of the normalized force applied by the impactor when the latter strikes the region of the pelvis great trochanter at speeds of between 6 and 10 m per sec. The results presented in this chapter are obtained from tests performed with a linearly guided impactor at speeds of 7 and 8 m per sec. respectively. TEST SET-UP AND INSTRUMENTATION - Five tests were conducted for each speed and with each dummy with a spherical impactor of weight 17.3 kg, similar to that used by INRETS with a diameter of 120 mm and a radius of curvature of 150 mm. It can be seen that these dimensions are different from those recommended by the ISO which, if these had been applied to the tests, would have led to an impactor of totally unsual dimensions, i.e. the impactor would have struck the dummy and the seat. The impactor was positioned so as to strike the center of the sorbothane block for EUROSID and H point of the pelvis for SID. The dummy was placed in an upright seated position on a rigid seat covered with two sheets of teflon. The choice of the pelvis-seat interface was not obvious. On the one hand, ISO does not mention the type of seat to be provided for this type of test, and INRETS in experiments involving the pelvis with cadavers (24) used an ordinary seat. Therefore, we opted for a solution corresponding to the previous evaluations of pelvis biofidelity of the EUROSID (26) in which the pelvis-seat interface was, precisely, in teflon. The instrumentation for both dummies consissted of acceleration measurements for the sacrum and the impactor. In addition, the EUROSID instrumentation for measurement of the pubic symphis and iliac wing forces was used. The tests were filmed. The filtering frequency classes corresponded to CFC 180 for impactor acceleration and CFC 1000 for the other parameters. Figure 38 shows the test conditions for which the results are given below. EUROSID AND SID RESPONSES IN IMPACTOR TESTS - The results obtained are resumed in tables 20 and 21. In general, it is possible to observe reasonable repeatability of EUROSID and SID pelvic responses, except for the pubic symphis force and the left iliac wing force, which for the EUROSID show coefficients of variation of 7.8 and 21 % respectively. When the impact velocity changed from 7 to 8 m per sec., the overall repeatability of EUROSID parameters seems to have been improved. A higher sensitivity of pelvic responses as a function of impactor speed can be noted for the EUROSID dummy. The peak values of EUROSID additional measurements are given in tables 20 and 21. For this dummy, only the required 4.1205</page><page sequence="25">response, i.e. the impactors acceleration, was normalized. In table 22, EUROSID and SID normalized pelvic responses are reported. The effective mass Me was calculated using the ÄV according to the procedure proposed in (24). Both dummies show, similar values of Me, i.e. of 13 kg ; this leads to similar normalizing factors Rf. Performances of EUROSID and SID are illustrated respectively in figures 39 and 40, where the dummy's impactor normalized force is compared to the ISO requirement. Responses of both dummies exceed the limits of the cadaver. The difference dummy-cadaver is however higher for the EUROSID dummy. In 7 m/s impactor tests, for instance, a ratio of 1.7 is observed between the SID response and the top limit of the ISO requirement ; this ratio achieves for EUROSID a value of 2.3. In order to better illustrate performances of these dummies as a function of velocity, the results obtained are compared to the corridor suggested by ISO (24) in figure 41. Figure 38.

C.M.C, in Europe. To obtain the fullest possible evaluation of this important dummy quality, the most recent and up-to-date evaluation data were employed as a human biomechanical reference. These data, selected and approved by the ISO experts, are set out in ISO documents DTR 9790-^1 through 6 (3). Body segments such as head, neck, thorax, shoulder, abdomen and pelvis were tested in accordance with the test conditions recommended in said documents. Duplication of these tests conditions posed some problems for certain segments (see chapter 2). For the pelvis, for example (test No. 1), in which an impactor laterally impacts the pelvis, no requirement concerning the type of seat is specified in document DTR 9790-6. We therefore performed these tests with a seat having a flat, smooth surface, without back support, and with two sheets of Teflon placed between the dummy's pelvis and the seat ; moreover, these conditions correspond to those used by INRETS (26) in evaluating the first EUROSID prototype. In addition, the dimensions of the impactor' s surface, as recommended by ISO, are incorrect. For the abdomen drop tests, ISO recommends (22) that the armrest be positioned in such a way that it is impacted by the lower rib of the dummy's thorax. If this position had been reproduced, for the EUROSID dummy a large part of the abdomen would not have been subjected to impact. Since this dummy was developed for the injury measurement crite- rion, the armrest was centered, in these tests, on the axis of the switches contacts designed precisely to allow such measurement (20). For the head evaluation tests (drop test No. 2), we performed the recommended drop tests (1.2 meters on a padding 5 mm thick), while varying the tests conditions to obtain a head only drop, a guided head only drop, and, finally, the same drop with the whole dummy. The latter configuration, moreover, complies with the conditions of the cadaver tests performed by APR (12). When comparing the head only drop and the guided drop, the differences between the head acceleration results are 1 %. These differences are as great as 9 % (EUROSID) and 13 % (SID) when comparing the free head drop and the whole dummy drop. From the above remarks, it is clear that in the future it would be worth supplementing the ISO documents with a practical User's Manual of recommended test conditions. The main purpose of the normalization procedure applied to the dummy data was to reduce the scatter between tests in an identical configuration. For the shoulder, thorax and abdomen, we observed that this procedure was capable of amplifying or attenuating the basic test data, but no fundamental change is observed (generally a variation of 5 % to 8 %). On the other hand, for drop tests with the SID abdomen, one notes that the normalization procedure amplifies (or attenuates) the original results to a far greater extent than what is observed for the other segments, namely, by a factor of 4. In this respect, the application of normalization to the SID abdomen poses a problem. On the basis of the available results, the conclusions concerning the biofidelity performance of the two dummies can be presented as follows. HEAD RESPONSE - For rigid impacts, the responses of both dummies are outside the required corridor, although the EUROSID response is closer to the corridor than the SID response. For damped impacts, the responses of both dummies are higher than the corridor's upper limit. For such impacts, padding attenuates the differences between the responses of the two heads. NECK RESPONSES - For low-violence sled tests, both dummies appear to comply with the specification concerning the maximum lateral acceleration at Tl, with the SID peak being closer to the stipulated limits. Now, if the comparison between the two dummies is taken further with the time envelope (8) suggested by ISO reference DTR 9790-2, it can be seen that the EUROSID response matches the volunteer's response better than the SID. For lateral displacement of Tl (the neck base), the EUROSID response is within the required limits, while the SID response is well below the required limits. A comparison between the e.g. trajectories of the SID and EUROSID heads and the volunteer corridor showed that the SID response is outside the corridor's limits, while the EUROSID response is within them. In terms of the head lateral flexion angle, here again EUROSID seems in a better position than the SID. From the mechanical viewpoint, the results achieved clearly show that the SID neck is stiffer than the EUROSID neck, for it simulates the volunteer's behavior less accurately. Moreover, neither dummy complies with the ISO specification concerning the head twist angle, giving values well below than required. For very violent tests, the responses of both dummies are close to the upper limits of the ISO corridors. It is surprising to observe that the SID neck has a greater head e.g. trajectory than the EUROSID. This can be explained by the fact that the Tl lateral displacement is approximatly 1.3 times higher for the SID. SHOULDER RESPONSES - The normalized impactor force for EUROSID is located almost entirely in the ISO corridor. In terms of shoulder deflection, the EUROSID and SID responses are two and four times higher than the specification, respectively. The major deflection noted for SID can be explained by the very low stiffness of the foam block 4.1208</page><page sequence="28">881717 simulating the dummy's shoulder, which allows high deflection for a low force level. Moreover, a sharp deterioration was observed in the foam (problem of durability). THORAX RESPONSES - For drops from a height of 1 meter onto a rigid surface, the dummies' responses in terms of normalized thoracic force are outside of the corridor. The time-history and the magnitude of EUROSID response are, however, much closer to the cadaver reference than those of the SID. The maximum thoracic deflection for SID is closer to the stipulated limits. For 2-meters drops, the thoracic force timehi story shows no large differences between the two dummies, and is for all tests slightly outside the corridor. The SID's thoracic deflection is in compliance with the specifi- cations, while that of EUROSID is slightly higher than the cadaver upper limit. The good performance of the SID dummy for the thoracic deflection, in the drop tests, should be attenuated by the fact that the rib deflection has not the same physical sense for SID and EUROSID respectively, since the SID rib cage may deflect and rotate while that of the EUROSID can only deflect. The EUROSID deflection rib data, given here, were obtained from three potentiometers, which equipped the dummy rib cage. The EUROSID special instrumentation for the measurement of rib deflection was used only during the first series of drop tests, since this showed errors (constant offsets in rib deflection time- histories). For the impactor tests, the responses of both dummies in terms of normalized acceleration (FIR 100 Hz) are well outside the corridor. For impactor acceleration, the same trend is observed, but the dummy-corridor differences are slighter. ABDOMEN-RESPONSES - Whatever the drop height (one or two meters), the SID responses are well outside specifications. We saw in Chapter 3 that normalization had a major amplifying effect (for abdominal force) or attenuating effect (for rib acceleration) on the original SID results, by a factor close to 4. A direct comparison between the non- normalized SID data and the requirements in no way gives a better abdomen performance for this segment, except for acceleration of the lower rib, which comes nearer to the cadaver limits for the 1 -meter tests. For EUROSID, the responses in terms of acceleration of the lower rib and spine exceed the required limits, but they are better for 2-meter drops. This dummy's abdomen shows very stiff behavior in terms of abdominal force and the levels obtained were far higher than the ISO corridor (coefficients of approximately 1.90 and 2.50 are noted for the 1 and 2-meter tests, respectively) . Moreover, analysis of the film showed that the abdomen reached its maximum deflection in all tests. PELVIS RESPONSE - The responses of both dummies are well above the required limits for normalized i-mpactor force for both the impact speeds used, namely, 7 and 8 m/s. CONCLUSIONS For easy interpretation of the study results, the performance of each dummy response has been summarized in table A. For each ISO requirement, there may be only a single required response for head requirement No. 1 for example, or up to nine required responses for neck requirement No. 1. For each of the ISO requirements, the results have been classified by allocating a score for each required response. For this purpose, the results were classified in three categories, A, B and C. For : - A : the response is excellent, located within the required limits, - B : the response is close to the required limits ; it must be improved, - C : the response is very remote from the specifications and is regarded as unacceptable. Table A shows that : 1. The biofidelity of both dummies is rather bad in comparison with the ISO requirements as a whole. More "C"s are observed than "B"s or "A"s and accordingly in most cases the responses are very poor (unacceptable). SID's score, with 23 "C"s, is even worse, as against 15 "C"s for EUROSID. 2. EUROSID has a higher number of "B" scores than ! D , with 12 "B"s as compared with 6, and especially a higher number of "A" scores (9, as compared with 7 for SID).
