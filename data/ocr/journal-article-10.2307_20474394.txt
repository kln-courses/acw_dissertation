Western art historians usually know his book about Leonardo da Vinci, which was translated into English2 as well as a number of seminal papers on the history of Renaissance architectural theory, which are still widely cited today. Historians of science know his important works on the early modern history of atomism and optics and that their author received the George Sarton medal in I963 - the greatest re cognition in the field of the history of science, whose other recipients in those years were Lynn Thorndike and Alexandre Koyre. Those interest ed in Russian cultural and architectural history of the Stalin era know about Zubov as the Russian translator of Leon Battista Alberti's De re aedifi catoria and Daniele Barbaro's commentary on Vitruvius. The last fact alone should be enough to introduce the author of the books listed above: it has taken a team of three scholars to produce the most recent English translation of Alberti's treatise whereas, because of the wide interdisci plinary knowledge such a project would require, no translations of Barbaro's commentary in other languages except Russian have ever been made. Zubov's extensive commentary on Alberti's trea tise, which accompanies the translation of De re aedificatoria, remains unmatched by anything thus far produced within Western scholarship. In recent years there has been a renaissance of inter est in Zubov's work in Russia and six of his books have been published since I999, most of them for the first time.3 The publication of these I I should like to express my gratitude to Maria Zubova and Dimitri Bayuk for their help in the preparation of this review as well as to Karen Wise for the careful proof-reading of the text. Sections from this article were presented at the Conference of the Society of Architectural Historians of Australia and New Zealand in Perth, Australia, 2006. 2 Vasily Pavlovich Zubov, Leonardo da Vinci. Translated by David H. Kraus, Cambridge I968. 3 Besides the titles listed in the head of this article, the following books by Zubov have been published in recent years in Russia: Apucmomemb (Aristotle), Mos COW 2000. The book is a reprint of Zubov's I963 book on Aristotle. It is a popular survey of Aristotle's and Aristotelian philosophy which has the great merit of reviewing Byzantine Aristotelian works, often omitted in similar surveys published in English or German. Art historians will be intrigued by the essay on the history of visual representations of Aristotle (Aristotle's por traits) published in printed books since the Renais sance. PYCCKue nponooe6nUKu (Russian Preachers), Moscow 2001. The book contains a series of essays about the great preachers of the Russian Orthodox Church.

Three of these books, listed above, pre dominantly consist of material unpublished so far and contain works of substantial importance in the context of modern scholarship. Vasiliy Pavlovich Zubov was born on the ist of August I900 into a family which already had a history of achievements in science and cultural life: his father, Pavel Vasilyevich, published scientific works on thermo-chemistry, was an ac complished violinist and assembled a major col lection of Eastern coins. The education Vasiliy Pavlovich received was largely based on classical languages and philosophy - he enrolled in the philosophy department of Moscow University in I9I8 and graduated in 1922, in the last generation of students before that department was closed down by the Bolsheviks. In 1923 Zubov started working for the State Academy of Artistic Scien ces (EA.X.H. [G.A.H.N.]) - and his most im portant duty there consisted in writing a series of entries for the Terminological Encyclopaedia of Artistic Sciences.4 In those years he also wrote a number of studies about Goethe and the history of optics and perspective. These early works have been now published in the II3a6paHble mpyObt (Selected Works), the third book listed above and discussed in this review. After the Academy of Artistic Sciences was closed down in 1929, Zubov moved to the Academy of Archi tecture where he stayed until 1945. These were Zubov's most fruitful years, when it comes to his contributions to architectural history. His trans lation of Alberti's De re aedificatoria was pub lished in I935, followed by a second volume in I937, which included an extensive commentary on Alberti's treatise. A year later his translation of Daniele Barbaro's commentary on Vitruvius came out. During the war years Zubov worked on his doctoral dissertation, which he defended in I946. The dissertation has recently been pub lished for the first time as ApxumeKmypnaH meopua Adb6epmu (Alberti's Architectural Theory) in an edition prepared by Dimitri Bayuk and it is the second book to be discussed in this review. In 1945 Zubov moved his &gt;desk&lt; to the Institute for the History of Science of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, where he remained work ing until his death in I963. In this period he wrote his monograph about Leonardo da Vinci, as well as books about the history of atomism, Aristotle and the history of science in Russia. A monograph about the theoretical background of medieval architects, published for the first time in the Tpy6bi no ucmopuu u meopuu apxumeK mypbt (Works on Architectural History) listed as the first book above, also belongs to this period. Besides this monograph (8- 374), TpyObt no ucmopuu u meopuu apxumeKmypbt contains the Russian translations of a number of Zubov's articles, which were originally published in west European languages and thus remained less known to Russian readers. The book also in cludes two biographical essays by Viktor Nikola evich Grashchenkov and Maria Zubova (477 489) as well as a complete bibliography of Zu bov's works (489-504). The monograph about the theoretical background of medieval architects was intended to be tripartite, dedicated to By zantine, medieval Western European and Russian architects. The Byzantine section was prepared according to the author's handwritten manuscript and is incomplete in the sense of citations, where as the part dedicated to Western European medi eval architecture, derived from the author's type tise &gt;&gt;On Continuity&lt;.), Moscow 2004. This volume contains Zubov's translations of and commentaries of these two medieval treatises. 4 Zubov prepared the bibliography and wrote a number of articles, but the whole project was abandoned, when G.A.H.N. was closed down. Three of Zubov's articles which have now been published in Russian have been previously published in an English translation: Vasilii Zubov, Ideal. Autonomy. Synthesis of Art, in: Experi ment. A Journal of Russian Culture 3, 1997, 274-276.

Band/ 2007</page><page sequence="3">script, comes provided with a complete scholarly apparatus. A brief plan of the third part, which was never written, has been included (457-463). The basic structure of all three parts is very sim ilar, starting with a discussion of fundamental concepts and terminology of medieval architec ture, followed by a discussion of the position of the architects in their respective societies, the con straints and creative freedom they had, the theo retical knowledge available to them and of the treatment of architecture in contemporary theo logical writings. The monograph was conceived as a general survey text and Zubov's immense eru dition allows him to cite a remarkable number of medieval sources. While the book does not demand a specialist reader, it does require a reader well read in medieval intellectual history. ApxumeKmypHaa meopua A.4b6epmu (Alber ti's Architectural Theory) presents Zubov's doc toral dissertation from I946. It would be, how ever, quite wrong to understand this book as comparable to modern doctoral dissertations in German or English-speaking academia. This is a work of a mature scholar, who has already pub lished the translation of and a commentary on De re aedifiactoria. Read in the context of our modern scholarship, the book contains a remark able amount of novel insights, important dis coveries grounded in the systematic exploration of sources and some very original resolutions of old and well-known debates of Albertian scho larship. Valuable additional comments on each chapter have been provided by Dimitri Bayuk. A French translation has recently been published in the Albertiana.5 Zubov's approach to Alberti is that of a philo sopher - or a historian of philosophy -, who at tempts to explain ideas by studying not only their origin but also the way they were used in arguments and how these ideas contribute to the argumentational structure of Alberti's architec tural theory. The book contains fourteen major essays structured around specific interpretative problems. In the discussion of Alberti's sources, philosophers and mathematicians receive by far the greatest attention. The most important achievements of the book derive from the em phasis it makes on reading Alberti's theoretical ideas in the context of Aristotelian philosophy. Zubov presents an important argument regarding the old debate about Alberti's acquaintance with Platonist philosophy: his systematic survey of all nineteen contexts in which Plato is cited in De re aedificatoria shows that eighteen of them come from the Laws and one from Timaeus. Alberti knew Timaeus only second hand, Zubov in ferred, whereas he knew the Laws on the basis of the Latin translation by George of Trebizond (59-72). Zubov also managed to establish that in five cases Alberti's citations from the Laws sus piciously resemble Cicero's formulations and he identified Cicero as the important source of oc casional Platonist tendencies in Alberti. At the same time, Cicero's own theory of rhetoric, so much emphasised by modern scholarship as the source of Alberti's theoretical framework, is re cognised - Zubov noted analogies between Cicero's and Alberti's use of the term concinnitas (265) - but this recognition is accompanied by a warning against the mechanical transmission of the categories of Ciceronian rhetoric into Alber ti's architectural theory (274). Similar terminol ogy, ultimately, cannot guarantee similar argu mentational structure and, with all these lateral influences recognised, the main body of Alberti's architectural theory is based on Aristotelian framework. It is also in the Aristotelian context that one should understand the parallels that Alberti drew between a building and the organic world. Anthropomorphism such as Francesco di Giorgio Martini's, as well as symbolic representa tions of the living world through buildings were remote from Alberti's intentions, Zubov argued (98). The relationship between Nature and art in Alberti's theory has to be construed in the con text of the fact that in Greek philosophy, includ ing Aristotle's, Nature itself is understood as the product of art (96). This applies also to the anal ogy between architectural and musical proporti ons - and three years before Rudolf Wittkower's Architectural Principles Zubov presented, in chapter six of his dissertation, an equivalent ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KUNSTGESCHICHTE 70. Band/ 2007 I4I</page><page sequence="4">description of the role of harmonic proportions in Renaissance architecture (without, however, succumbing to the temptation to ascribe them to Palladio on the basis of a limited number of ex amples) (I46-176). He also presented a thorough critique of Golden-Section based proportional theories and the belief that artistic problems can be resolved by mechanical application of &gt;&gt;for gotten recipes and formulas&lt;&lt; (178-204). The third book from the above list, 1K3w 6panHbte mpy0bt no ucmopuu u qj1uJocO4buu U acmemuKu (Collected Works on the History of Philosophy and Aesthetics) presents Zubov's very early essays, the majority of which were written before he turned thirty. Together with Maria Zubova's introductory essay which contains many interesting citations from her father's diary, the book is a wonderful document about the intellectual influences to which those young Russians, who rejected the Communist ideology were exposed to in the first decade after the re volution. Many of the essays also deserve atten tion on their own merit, because of the young Zubov's thoughtful analysis of the subjects he was writing about. Most of the essays were writ ten while Zubov was working for the Academy of Artistic Sciences and they testify the wide range of his readings. A number of essays are de dicated to Goethe's views on the philosophy of nature - Zubov seems to have read Goethe ex tensively in those years. Other essays discuss the views of nineteenth century aestheticians, de serving of mention are the extensive study about Jean-Paul Richter's aesthetics, Tolstoy, and a number of essays about Russian nineteenth cen tury aesthetic theories. One important aspect of Zubov's methodology is his rejection of Geistesgeschichte - by this I particularly mean his disagreement with the view that properties of the works of art and architec ture (or any intellectual artefacts) can be ex plained by their author's membership in various collectives, including their epoch and its spirit. &gt;&gt;The unity of the Spirit of time is a foundation too unstable for a really synthetic study of the problems of science and art.&lt;&lt;6 Zubov system atically dismissed the assumption that individual authors were mere manifestations of their collec tives (epochs) and that the historical context of their activity could be taken as the determining factor or the explanatory principle of their crea tivity. The understanding of epochs as unified, organic entities, which determine individual crea tivity is naive, Zubov complained; such &gt;&gt;pseudo organicism&lt;&lt; overlooks real historical connections and relies on arbitrary analogies and approxima tions (3 I ). Metaphorical understanding of history should have no place in scholarship and there can be no formulas, which would determine the &gt;&gt;spirit of the epoch&lt;&lt;. His favourite targets in the Alberti book are Heinrich W6lfflin and Dagobert Frey. W6lfflin explained the difference between Renaissance and Baroque architecture as one be tween the emphases on necessity (Renaissance) and freedom (Baroque) in design. He cited Alber ti's definition of beauty (a relationship between parts to which nothing can be added or taken away) as an example of the Renaissance emphasis on necessity (II2). Frey, then, argued that the Renaissance understood a geometrical body as a body-in-space, whereas Antiquity worked with discrete representations of bodies (4I2). In both cases Zubov's initial response is to say that such general qualifications overlook the internal con tradictions which exist within an epoch (34). At first, this criticism may sound as a typical counter-argument a Soviet historian would offer against a neo-Hegelian (&gt;&gt;idealist?) explanation based on the Spirit of the Time. A typical step would be to introduce class struggle as the ex planatory contradiction of the epoch. One ex planatory collective (&gt;&gt;epoch&lt;&lt;) would be replaced with another (&gt;&gt;class?), but ultimately, an indi vidual author's work would be explained and 6 Vasily Pavlovich Zubov, ApxumeKmypuaq meopua A.db6epmu, St. Petersburg 2001, 3I. 7 Karl Marx, Zur Kritik der politischen Oekonomie, in: Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, Werke, Berlin 1972, vol. 13, 2-92, here 9. I42 ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KUNSTGESCHICHTE 70. Band/ 2007</page><page sequence="5">assumed to be determined by that author's mem bership in a group. After all, Karl Marx famously wrote that &gt;&gt;human beings' consciousness does not determine their being, but their social being determines their consciousness&lt;&lt;7. However, Zubov's critical approach does not develop in this direction. Instead of the Marxian narrative about economic forces and class strug gle, he introduced the principle of a &gt;specific historical understanding of the environment&lt; (32). His point is that we cannot infer what a Renaissance person thought from a set of general statements about the epoch; if we want to explain Alberti's views, generalizations about his epoch will help us little. Rather, we need to look at the specific context of his own environment. The result is an individualist understanding of collec tives; groups cannot have any properties which are not reducible to the sums of the properties of the individuals that constitute them. From this position, Zubov easily targeted Wolfflin's and Frey's views by citing individual counter-exam ples. He thus pointed out that Alberti's concept of ornamentum contradicts Wolfflin's under standing of the concept of necessity in Renais sance art (II 3). Against Frey he pointed out that already Witelo, in the thirteenth century, had the concept of shape-in-space, such as Frey ascribed to the Renaissance (4I4). Zubov's methodological concept in which groups are always understood as the sums of individuals consequently yields a historical nar rative in which collective entities, such as epochs, are described as mosaics of individual views. The monograph about the theoretical views of medi eval architects published in the TpyObt no uc mopuu u meopuu apxumeKmypbl (Works on the History of Architecture) thus presents Byzantine epoch by listing the views of a great number of authors, such as Eusebius Pamphilius, Gregory of Nyssa, Procopy, Paul Silentiarius, various leg ends about the church of St. Sophia (including Turkish traditions), Photius, Constantine of Rhodes, descriptions of imaginary architecture in Byzantine novels and so on. The views of a collective (epoch) consist of the views and ideas of the individuals that constitute it. Collectives (epochs) are not to be understood as essences instantiated in these individuals. When Zubov argues general propositions about the creative activity within a certain epoch - for instance when he claims that, unlike west-European, By zantine symbolism never attempted to convert the building in a ?book for the illiterate&lt;&lt; (72) - his statement is an observation which makes no claim to provide an explanatory principle. Zubov does not say, for instance, that Byzantine artists could not conceive of doing things differently because they were Byzantines. Erwin Panofsky, in his seminal essay The His tory of Art as a Humanistic Discipline defined humanist historiography as marked by the pos tulates of universal rationality and the free will of individual historical subjects.8 Insofar as Zubov's methodology assumes that an individual author's membership in a collective cannot be taken to determine his or her creative decisions, his ap proach implies the free will of these authors. Similarly, insofar as the membership in a collec tive cannot be taken to determine and explain the rationality of human subjects, the implication is that rationality is available to humans indepen dently of their membership in specific collec tives. In other words, Zubov's position coincides with what Panofsky defined as the humanist method. In the essay mentioned, Panofsky was still not prepared to fully accept the implications of the method he defined. He still relied on ex planatory collective entities such as &gt;&gt;tradition&lt;&lt;. Also, he was unwilling to reject his earlier view 8 Panofsky, The History of Art as a Humanistic Disci pline, in idem, Meaning in the visual arts. Papers in and on art history, Garden City I9S 5, I -25; for the defini tion of Humanism, see especially the opening section, I -3.

Band/ 2007 143</page><page sequence="6">that homogenous space was inconceivable for individuals before the Renaissance and claimed that &gt;&gt;no medieval man could see the civilization of antiquity as a phenomenon complete in itself and historically detached from the contemporary world?.9 Panofsky developed the full application of the humanist programme in his historio graphy gradually and only later in his life. Zu bov, however, relied on it from the beginning. After I9I7 Russian intellectual life was divided between those authors, who identified themselves with the Soviet regime, those who left the country to constitute the anti-Soviet intelligentsia abroad, and those who stayed in the country but maintai ned distance from the official ideology. In an essay about Ana Achmatova, Michele Colucci referred to this third group as &gt;&gt;a-Soviet&lt; authors. Russia's greatest writers of the twentieth century - Bulgakov, Achmatova, Pasternak belong to this group. Zubov, arguably Russia's greatest intellec tual historian of the twentieth century, is to be counted among them as well. While his work may thus be regarded as an important document of his times, considering the importance of Zubov's contributions, this could also be seen as a lateral reason for its study and translation. A much more important point is that Zubov still has much to teach us. In the field of Albertian studies, for instance, even today, his results are often ahead of what modern Western scholarship has achieved, while, at the same time, they are sadly inaccessible to the experts in the field.'0 When the commen tary on De re aedificatoria was published in 1939 as the second volume accompaying the translation of Alberti's treatise, the reviewer in Isis pointed out how important it would be to provide an English translation of this seminal work: &gt;&gt;no Western scholar can afford to disregard the exi stence of volume II&lt;." Such a translation still does not exist, much to the detriment of contem porary Albertian scholarship. The same applies to most of Zubov's other works and time is overdue for a systematic translation of his opus in English or other West European languages. Branko Mitrovic 9 Ibid., 4, note 8. io This is not only because of the language barrier. After very intensive searches in North American, German, Italian, Serbian, New Zealand and Australian libraries I have not managed to locate one single copy of Zubov's Russian translation of De re aedificatoria.
