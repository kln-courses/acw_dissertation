<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LIFE OF THE SPIDER. By John Crompton. Floughton Mifflin Co., Boston. $3.00. 254 pp.; ill. 1951. Since most people display a fear or hatred of spiders, the naturalist welcomes worthwhile books that attempt to dispel these feelings. Using the literary techniques of the journalist, Crompton has written his book in a popular fashion and with this aim in view. There is no doubt that his enthusiasm will be communicated to the general reader, who will thus feel less revulsion for spiders and perhaps may even become an admirer. The book contains much that is praiseworthy. But it is regrettable that the author was not able to avoid the usual pitfalls in the path of the popular writer, such as anthropomorphism, generalization, the perpetuation of legends which have repeatedly been proved untrue, misrepresentation, and readability at the expense of accuracy. The original printing of this book appeared in England in 1950 under the title, The Spider. The text of The Life of the Spider is identical with the British work except for the addition of an Introduction, a few titles to the literature list, and some footnotes intended primarily to make the book more valuable to American readers. Practically all of the great deal of information to be found in this work is based on the writings of others who actually studied spiders, and mixed with it are the author's philosophical thoughts and his own (sometimes false) interpretations. To the expert it is plain that Crompton has read only a rather small part of the literature on spiders. He leans most heavily on Bristowe and on Fabre, devotes an entire chapter to the latter. Some readers may find themselves irritated by lengthy, irrelevant asides. Others may find the verbosity tiring. It is to his credit that Crompton abhors the adjec- tives "dirty," "repulsive," and "ugly" when used by others in alluding to spiders, but it is hard to reconcile this viewpoint with his own frequent use of "stupid," "cruel," "savage," "reprehensible," and "hard-hearted" in describing them. He warns his readers about general- izing and correctly points out that despite Fabre's account of a Lycosa which carried her spiderlings for 6 or 7 months it is nevertheless a fact that British wolf spiders may carry theirs for only 2 or 3 weeks. But again, how are we to reconcile this with his own errone- ous generalizations, such as that all male spiders, are incapable of spinning snares; that females almost always eat their mates; that crab spiders select flowers to match</page><page sequence="2">314 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY their own coloring and that they are the most devoted of all spider mothers; that egg sacs are provided with a hard outer covering to keep out insect enemies; and so forth. In several places Crompton repeats the incorrect statement that spiders merely suck blood, e.g., "It is blood she wants, not meat" (p. 32). Yet he correctly recounts from McKeown the manner in which a spider can digest solid portions of its prey before swallowing. One wishes that the author had been more consistent! Confusion also results from expressions such as "average spider," "live corpses," and "unspiderlike shape." His concept that the mating of spiders represents an "arti- ficial insemination" is unfortunate. Another indication of the author's disdain for precision is given by his sub- stitution of the term "smell" for the more precise term "chemotactic sense," which he considers difficult to pronounce. Moreover he implies that Doleschall and DeGeer were Americans, while in point of fact they were Hungarian and Swede, respectively. In certain places Crompton indicates by footnotes that a particular species being discussed may also occur in the United States, or else he gives the name of the related species. Because of his admitted abhorrence of classification these footnotes sometimes incorrectly refer to entirely unrelated species. Moreover, although he dwells at length upon the changes in name of British spiders there is no attempt made to bring up to date the names used by Peckham in 1889. And while accounts are supplied of the bolas spiders of Australia and South Africa, it is regrettable that not even a footnote is given concerning the American species with similar habits, which were made known originally in1903 and reviewed in a well illustrated popular article by Gertsch several years ago. Throughout the work Crompton suggests explana- tions for phenomena in an anthropomorphic manner. In fact, he admits to being "unashamedly" so (p. 174). He accounts for the evolution of the pitcher plant spider by assuming that the spider "came to realize" it was on to a good thing, and that it later even developed a hard outer covering in order to resist the action of the plant's juices. For those interested in the evolutionary process he offers this aside concerning the sense of sight in man: "In the case of the animal, man, who uses the sense of sight more than any of the others, a strange phenomenon is taking place-the sense is deteriorating. ... Now nature usually rewards the continued use of a member by improving that member and punishes neglect in the opposite way.... That is why domestic hens cannot fly and seals cannot walk and why we cannot recognize our friends in the dark by their smell. By right we ought to be able to demand from nature increasingly efficient eyes.... She will give us even better eyes, but only in her own time. And not if we wear spectacles.... I am not suggesting that we discard spectacles for the sake of our remote progeny." This book is a curious admixture of good and bad in which the author has assembled much interesting in- formation and has presented it vividly. In this review more emphasis has been placed on the faults, since they are more likely to escape the casual reader than are the creditable features. B. J. KASTON</page></plain_text>
