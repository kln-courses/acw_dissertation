<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nasra-nT (Na wpatos) and hanf (0vLK6 ): studies on the religious vocabulary of Christianity and of Islam' FRANCOIS DE BLOIS School of Oriental and African Studies (1) nasranl In the Greek gospels Jesus is associated with the town of Nazareth (NatapWO, Naoapd, etc.; Syriac Nais(a)raO2), and is himself given the epithet 'Nazarene' (Natap-qv6s) or 'Nazoraean' (Natwpairos). The two adjectives are used inter- changeably, with no difference in meaning-sometimes one is merely a textual variant for the other-and there are enough passages to show that the authors of the gospels, at least, did understand them to refer to Nazareth. The endings --v6s and -ai-oS are both used in post-classical Greek to form adjectives and they fluctuate with each other also in the case of 'Eoayv6os versus 'Eaoatos, 'Essene'. There are other examples, in the Septuagint and elsewhere, for the representation of North-West Semitic (affricative?) s by Greek 4 (ancient [zd]), and also for the representation of ?wa mobile both by a (as in Na4apO6, Nataplv6ds, Latin Nazareth, Nazaraeus, Nazarenus) and by w (as in Na~wpafos), the latter notably before laryngeals and r.3 There is, in short, no sound reason to doubt that 'Nazarene' and 'Nazoraean' do in fact mean 'the man of Nazareth'.4 The plural Nawpat-ot occurs only once in the Bible, in Acts 24:5, where Paul's opponents refer to him as the 'leader of the sect of the Nazoraeans' (77pwCTroUardrl 7Ti- rCvr NaCwpa(wv alpicEws ,). This passage could have been understood as giving biblical sanction to the use of the name Nazoraeans to designate the followers of Jesus of Nazareth, as a community, but in fact in 'Extracts from the first and second sections of this paper were read at the Seminar for Arabian Studies, in London, in 1998 and 2000 respectively, and a version of the first section was read, and also distributed in typescript, at a conference on 'Die Inkulturation des Christentums im Sasanidenreich', in Wittenberg in 1999. I am very grateful for written or oral comments received from A. Khosroyev, M. Kropp, W. Muiller, N. Sims-Williams, but especially W. Sundermann and R. M. Voigt. 2 In their diverging accounts of the nativity both Matthew and Luke have NagapEO, variant -iT, but in the story of Jesus's preaching in the synagogue of his home town the best lectio both in Mt. 4:13 and Lk. 4:16 seems to be Nacapd, with the variant readings -pdo, -pd-, -p?d, -pir; Naapd was thus presumably the reading in Q. The Pgittf and Vetus Syrus have Nafsra. in all passages, but Natapd suggests an Aramaic status absolutus *Nas(a)rf, while NajapdO points to the status constructus Nas(o)ra0, presumably abbreviated from a phrase meaning 'Nazareth of Galilee' (cf. Na~apO8 sr FahAtAatas in Mt. 21:11, Mk. 1:9). Palestinian Christian Aramaic nzrt, nzryt, nzwrt, and the adjectives nzry', nzwry' all clearly derive from Greek and have no relevance for determining the indigenous Aramaic form of the name. 3 Examples for w for ?wa in the Greek versions of the Old Testament are listed in Schaeder, 1942. The legitimacy of these spellings is now supported by the fact that in the fragment of the Hebrew text of Isaiah discovered at Qumran (lQIsaa) there are several instances where, in a similar phonetic environment, the Iwva of the Masoretic text is represented by w, e.g. Isa. 10:12 pwri' (MT: parT); Isa. 37:38 hwrrt (MT: 'drarat), as has been noted by Wise, 1992. For the preceding, see Schaeder's still fundamental article 'Nagapv6ds, Na?wparos' (Schaeder, 1942), with a survey of the older literature. The lasting achievement of Schaeder's study is that it showed that there are no valid linguistic objections to the derivation of Nacwparos, or of Mandaic n'swr'y', from the name of Nazareth and thus took away the foundation for all the adventuresome theories that assigned some different meaning to those names; most of these had linked them to the Hebrew or Akkadian root n-s-r, 'to observe, watch over, guard' (Aramaic n-t-r, Arabic n-z-r) and many had gone on to claim that the non-existent town of Nazareth was invented by the Christian tradition to account for Jesus's supposedly misunderstood epithet. The phantasma- goric school of Nazoraean studies has survived Schaeder's attack (e.g. with Gfirtner), but it has not found much favour with competent Semitists.

The earliest post-biblical reference is in Tertullian, who, writing around the year 200, says that Christ was called the Nazoraean and for this reason 'the Jews call us Nazarenes because of him'.5 Then, around 331, Eusebius says of the place name Nazareth that 'from this name the Christ was called a Nazoraean, and in ancient times we, who are now called Christians, were once called Nazarenes';6 thus he attributes this designation to an unspeci- fied past and seems consequently to imply that the name was not used by the Christians of his own time. But from the latter part of the fourth century onwards, the name Nazoraeans is used by Christian authors specifically to designate one or more of the supposedly heretical sects of the type which in modern theological literature are usually called Jewish Christians,7 that is to say Christian sects which (according to their opponents) followed the law of the Jews, in particular as regards circumcision and the sabbath. The earliest extant work to use the name Nazoraean in this sense is the great anti-heretical compendium of Epiphanius, written about 377. Like Eusebius before him, Epiphanius claims that once all Christians were known as Nazoraeanss and that when Paul's opponents called him the leader of the sect of the Nazoraeans he did not disown the name because 'at that time everyone called Christians by that name'.9 But, Epiphanius says, the name was later appropriated by a group of heretics, who, he claims, believe, with the Christians, that Jesus is the Christ and the son of God, but otherwise follow the law of the Jews. Besides this they read the gospel of Matthew 'in Hebrew' and 'in Hebrew letters'. They are 'Jews and nothing else', but the Jews hate them and malign them three times a day in their synagogues, saying 'May God curse the Nazoraeans '.lo Similarly, Epiphanius's younger contemporary and associate Jerome also says that there are heretics 'in all the synagogues of the east among the Jews' who are cursed by the Pharisees, and who 'are usually called Nazoraeans '.11 It has been noted12 that the older form of the Jewish 'dm6ad prayer did Sadv. Marc. iv 8 (K/R 108): 'nazaraeus uocari habebat secundum prophetiam Christus creatoris, unde et ipso nomine nos iudaei nazarenos appellant per eum'. The author's point seems to be that the Marcionites maintained that the 'prophecy' cited in Mt. 2:23, ostensibly stating that the Messiah would be called a Nazoraean, refers not to Jesus, the son of the Stranger, but to the 'creator's Christ', the Messiah expected by the Jews; against this Tertullian objects that the Jews themselves 'call us Nazarenes because of him', thus supposedly admitting that the Christ whom the Christians follow is indeed 'the creator's Christ'. 6 Eusebius, Onomasticon, in de Lagarde (1887: 278; K/R 150): Nagap~O. 50Ev ' Xpta-6k Nawwparos E"KAX1, Kai Na apivoi 6 7 raAal6v 4OiEVSg ot Oyvv XpwtaLavoi. Jerome's Latin translation of the Onomasticon (i.e. his de situ et nominibus locorum Hebraicorum liber) has (de Lagarde, 1887: 175; K/R 206): '... nos apud ueteres quasi pro obprobrio nazaraei dicebamur ... 'Jewish Christians' is a calque on the German term 'Judenchristen', coined, I think, by the Ttibingen school of Protestant theologians in the early part of the nineteenth century. One finds also 'Jud(a)eo-Christians' used with the same meaning, but this term has a different sense in English (e.g. in 'the Judaeo-Christian tradition', meaning the tradition which encompasses both Judaism and Christianity) and consequently seems inadequate in the special historical sense that concerns us here. The name Jewish Christians is certainly justified for those who were both Jews and Christians, that is, who counted themselves among the children of Israel and regarded Jesus to be the Messiah. But there are also those (e.g. the Babylonian Elchasaites) who had similar doctrines, but of whom we cannot say with certainty whether they actually considered themselves to be Jews. With reference to the latter it is perhaps better to put the words 'Jewish Christians' in inverted commas. s Panarion 29.1.3 (K/R 168). 9 Panarion 29.6.5 (K/R 170). 'o Panarion 29.9.2 (K/R 174).

In the Talmud Jesus of Nazareth is referred to several times as yw hnwsry and there are two talmudic passages which refer, unfortunately rather vaguely, to nwsrym, in the plural. The more helpful of these is in the treatise on fasting (Ta'dnTO 27b). We read here that in the days before the destruction of the temple certain worthies would not fast on Friday, Saturday or Sunday. All the authorities agree that in the case of Friday and Saturday this was out of respect for the Sabbath, but in the case of Sunday three different opinions are cited, among them that of Rabbi Y6hannan (who apparently lived in the second half of the third century) who declared that they did not fast on Sunday ' because of the nosrTm '. The implication would seem to be that the nosrtm fasted on Sunday and that Jews avoided doing so, so as not to conform with them, or be confused with them. But in this case one must conclude that, here at least, nosrfm does not simply mean 'Christians', but refers to some particular sect who, unlike the main stream of Christians, regarded Sunday not as feast day, but as a day of fasting.13 The other talmudic passage ('/fJ6a&amp; zara 6a) refers to the 'day of the nosrtm ', presumably meaning Sunday, but this does not tell us much. There is naturally a discrepancy between the statement by Tertullian (in the second century) that 'the Jews call us', the Christians in general, 'Nazarenes', and the statements by Epiphanius and Jerome (in the fourth century) that this is a name which Jews give to a particular sect of Christians. It is possible that, originally, 'Nazoraean' was the Jewish name for all the followers of the Jesus, first and foremost for the Christians in the synagogue, with whom, naturally, Jews had most intimate contact, but also for the Christians among the gentiles. This would explain why the author of Acts could depict the Jewish adversaries of the primitive Church as designating the Christians, and specifically the Jewish convert Paul, as 'Nazoraeans' and also why the gentile Christian Tertullian could maintain that 'Nazarene' is the name that Jews give 'us', though it is also possible that Tertullian has merely extrapolated this information from Acts 24. But in any event, very soon Jewish usage must have restricted this name to one or more of those Christian sects which continued to claim allegiance to Jewish law. The talmudic passage Ta'inTO 27b suggests that this happened before the end of the third century. In giving the name Nazoraean to non-catholic Jewish Christians the catholic polemicists of the fourth century were consequently following established Jewish usage, but on the same basis it is also likely that the Christians in the synagogue called themselves Nazoraeans as well. Although Epiphanius describes the Nazoraeans as a specific sect within the 'Jewish Christian' complex, he does not differentiate them particularly clearly from the other supposedly Judaizing denominations. Indeed, he says that the Nazoraeans had the 'same doctrines' as the Cerinthians,14 that they were joined by Elchasai and adopted his teachings and that Ebion (the alleged founder of the sect of the Ebionites) came out of the Nazoraeans. Similarly, the author of the Anacephalaiosis says that the Ebionites are similar to the Cerinthians and Nazoraeans, 'to whom the heresies of the Sampsaeans and 13 The passage can hardly mean that the Jews avoided fasting on Sunday so as not to provoke the Christians, for (as pointed out by Pritz, 1988: 98-9) neither at the time of the temple nor at that of Yohannan would the Jews have had to fear Christian harassment. Although there seems to be no evidence that any Christian sect ever fasted on Sunday, the Manichaeans did (more precisely: the Manichaean electi fasted every day and ate only at night, with the auditors joining their daytime fast on Sundays). If the Nazoraeans really fasted on Sundays then the Manichaean practice might be a retention from their own Jewish Christian (Elchasaite) roots. 14 Panarion 29.1.1 (K/R 168); 8lpola o pov7/Lara.</page><page sequence="4">4 FRANCOIS DE BLOIS the Elkesaites combined '."5 Epiphanius also has an entry'6 on a sect which he calls Nasaraeans (Nacapato^, with a), who supposedly also follow the Jewish law, practise circumcision, etc. They are not mentioned by any other author, and one must suspect that the 'Nazoraeans' and 'Nasaraeans' are very much the same thing. Perhaps Epiphanius received his information about the latter from a source in Aramaic or Hebrew, where the name would have been written with -s-. One does gain the impression that 'Nazoraean' is not, or not always, the name of a clearly defined sect, but covers a large part of the 'Jewish Christian' spectrum. In Mandaic writings we find the singular n'swr'y', the plural n'swr'yy' and the abstract noun variously spelt n's'rwt' and n'syrwt', forms which reflect the same fluctuating realization of the &amp;wa as in Naapqv6ds versus Na~wpaios.c7 In most passages 'Nazoraean' is a self-designation of the Mandaeans, in effect a synonym of m'nd'y', this despite the fact that Mandaeans are not Christians, and certainly not 'Jewish Christians', but followers of a religion that distances itself emphatically both from Judaism and from Christianity. On the other hand, in Ginzd (right) 55 the demon Jesus Christ calls himself a 'Nazoraean' and one who has come from the town of Nazareth (nysr't), and elsewhere, in a passage of bitter anti-Christian polemic,'" the souls of the departed Christians declare to Christ that they have given alms 'in the name of Jesus Christ, in the name of the holy'9 spirit, in the name of the god of the Nazoraeans ('l'h' d-n'swr'yy')'. But Christ is forced to prostrate himself before the Mandaean deity Manda 6-hayye, and when the deceased Christians ask their lord who this is to whom he has humbled himself, Christ admits that it is one who has ' not mentioned the name of the holy spirit, not mentioned the name of Christ, not mentioned the name of the god of the Nazoraeans'. The 'god of the Nazoraeans' is mentioned, again in a polemical context, also in Ginzd (left) 33. It is clear from this that the name Nazoraean is not only one by which the Mandaeans refer to themselves, but also one which their scriptures attach to certain Christians. The only plausible explanation for this is that the surviving community of Mandaeans (alias Nazoraeans) are in fact the descendants of an ancient Jewish Christian community who, presumably in the aftermath of some catastrophe, lost most of their own religious writings and subsequently adopted those of a rival community, indeed writings that contained polemics against their own former beliefs. But, despite taking over these alien scriptures, the community retains its old self-designation as 'Nazoraeans' and evidently also some quite substantial remnants of its original beliefs and cultic practices (in particular the typically Jewish-Christian emphasis on baptism, the designa- tion of the baptismal water as 'Jordan', the incorporation of several Old Testament patriarchs, and of John the Baptist, into the Mandaean pantheon, etc.). In this sense, the surviving Mandaeo-Nazoraeans represent a synthesis of two different religious traditions: that of Nazoraean Jewish Christianity and that of the non-Christian, non-Jewish, Babylonian, semi-Iranized and quasi- gnostic complex of authentic Mandaeism.20 15 Pseudo-Epiphanius, Anacephalaiosis ii 30.1 (K/R 160). 16 Panarion 18. 17 References in Drower and Macuch, 1963: 286-7 (with an untenable etymology), and in the index to Lidzbarski's translation of the Ginza, s.v.

Quite a few of the treatises are of manifestly non- Mandaean origin and some of these are possibly genuine Nazoraean (Jewish Christian) documents. The specifically Mandaean writings comprise an older stratum, evidently composed before the</page><page sequence="5">THE RELIGIOUS VOCABULARY OF CHRISTIANITY AND OF ISLAM 5 Manes, the founder of Manichaeism, was born in Babylonia and brought up in a 'Jewish Christian' baptist sect, the Elchasaites; this is stated quite clearly by an-Nadim, who claims that these Elchasaites were still 'numerous' in the swamps of southern Iraq in his own times, that is to say in the tenth century. The recently discovered Manichaean treatise in Greek, the so-called Cologne Mani Codex, confirms the Elchasaite background of Manichaeism and reports at some length on Manes's debates with the Baptists.21 Given the fact that the Mandaeans live in the same swampland as was formerly the refuge of the Elchasaites it is naturally tempting to think that their 'Nazoraean ' ancestors were in fact Elchasaites, but there is no evidence that the Elchasaites ever actually called themselves Nazoraeans. For this reason one must consider the possibility that the Mandaeans descend from some other 'Jewish Christian ' sect. The Manichaean Kephalaia in Coptic, for their part, contain an account of a debate between Manes and a certain 'Nazoreus' (four times Na?opEv3 and once Nacopatos).22 The latter asks Manes whether his god is good or evil. Manes answers (one has rather the impression that he falls into the trap set by his opponent) that he is a judge (KpLtrS ). The 'Nazoreus' replies: There is no judge who does not do evil, a view which Manes then endeavours to refute. The words attributed to the 'Nazoreus' seem quite foreign to 'Jewish Christianity', neither are they at all reminiscent of Mandaeism. Rather, the standpoint which opposes justice to goodness points unmistakably to Marcionism, but there is no likelihood that Marcionites ever called themselves Nazoraeans. It is possible that the passage in the Kephalaia is a conflation of two different stories: a debate between Manes and a Nazoraean, and a debate with a Marcionite. But it is perhaps more likely that the illiterate NadopEvs of the Coptic text (and its presumed Greek prototype) is an inadequate rendering of an Aramaic original which called the prophet's opponent a nzTrai, 'Nazirite', here in the sense of 'Christian ascetic, hermit'. Although, as mentioned, Epiphanius is the earliest datable author to use the name Nazoraean to designate a specific Christian sect, 'Nazoraeans' and 'Christians' are mentioned as two apparently separate communities a hundred years before Epiphanius in three Middle-Persian inscriptions set up, around the end of the third century, by the Zoroastrian high priest Kirdir (Kerdir?),23 where he boasts of having suppressed seven hostile faiths: yhwdy W ,mny W blmny W n'sl'y-variant (n)'s(l')[y]-W klstyd'n W mktky W zndyky.24 Six of these names are linguistically transparent: yhwdy is Middle Persian (= Neo- Persian) jahfid, 'Jews', borrowed from Aramaic before the MP shift of initial y- to j-. gmny (Jaman) is Middle Indian samana-, etc., Old Indian .sramana-;25 amalgamation with Nazoraeism (these would include the above-mentioned anti-Nazoraean polemics), and a neo-Mandaean stratum, composed after the acceptance of the Mandaean doctrines by the Nazoraeans, and containing elements both of Mandaeism and of Nazoraeism. 21 For the Arabic testimonia about the Elchasaites and the parallels in the Cologne Codex see in detail de Blois, 1995. For the Elchasaite background of Manichaeism see (besides other recent studies) in particular Merkelbach, 1988. 22 Kephalaia, ch. 89 (pp. 221-3). 23 The name of this person appears in the inscriptions as kltyl, kltyly, kltyr, krtyr, KapELp, KLpEEp and in Manichaean MP as kyrdyr. The readings adopted by modern scholars have varied according to their conceptions of its etymology, but I shall refrain, for the present, from reheating this old debate. 24 See most recently Gignoux, 1991: 60 (synoptic edition) and 70 (translation and notes). The list is complete in the inscription on the Ka'ba i Zarduit (KKZ, lines 9-10) and partially extant in those at Naqi i Rustam (KNRm, line 29) and Sar Maihad (KSM, line 14); for the latter two see also the edition by MacKenzie, 1989. 25 Turner, CDIAL no. 12685.</page><page sequence="6">6 FRAN(OIS DE BLOIS blmny (braman) is Middle Indian bramana-, etc., Old Indian brahmana-.26 The two terms occur in juxtaposition in Indian texts at least from the time of Atoka onwards,27 basically for the adepts of the two principal directions in Indian spirituality: those who seek salvation in personal devotion and ascet- icism, and those who seek it through the performance of the Vedic rituals, but in the time of Kirdir they mean in the first instance 'Buddhist' and 'Brahmanist' respectively. (n)'s(l') [y], apparently the reading in KNRm, and n'sl'y, in KKZ and KSM, are two different Persian representations of Aramaic nasrdy-.28 klstyd'n (kristiydn) is from Aramaic kris~tycn, Greek XpLtarav6s, with -d-, as often in MP inscriptions, as a pseudo-archaic spelling for intervocalic _y_-.29 zndyky (zandik), like Armenian zandik (in Eznik and Eli's), Arabic zind-q, means 'Manichaean '.30 mktky, on the other hand, has hitherto defied inter- pretation.31 After the Jews, who stand alone at the beginning of the passage, the list seems to comprise three pairs: Jaman and braman are two Indian religions, naisrdy and kristiydn appear to be two kinds of Christians, and 26 Turner, no. 9327. 27 e.g. in Asoka's inscription at Kandahar (Bloch, 1950: XIII 23); bramana va framana va amfie va prasamda, in the Greek version (Benveniste, 1964: line 17): fpapEvat 1q Kai UpatLEvoL 71 Kat aiAAot TLVES 01 ' TrpL 7771) E 3ELvav SlM-Pif07vEg. 28 The Persians were evidently undecided as to whether Semitic s sounded more like their s or their 6. In initial position it is still c'- in Neo-Persian MalTbJ (lexica: Yalipa), for Aramaic sl-fda, 'cross'. In old loanwords this ', like inherited Persian J, would presumably have become z in post-vocalic position, but this need not have been the case in words borrowed after the shift of -e to -z. So it is not really clear where n'sl'y is nazrdy or ndfiray. Both readings also seem possible in a Manichaean account of the crucifixion in Parthian (M 4574; see Boyce, 1975: text byd) when it refers to yygw' n'sr'y, 'Jesus the Nazarene', though the first word is (with its final ') clearly an Aramaicizing spelling. Even in the seventh century, Arabic s is still represented in 'Pahlavi' script by s evidently for 0) on the coins of hkm Y 'bwl's'n, i.e. al-Hakam ibn 'Abi l-'As (Walker, 1941: 86). 29 Hrbedistan 12.3 has klysy' in a context where the meaning 'Christian' is required. Kotwal and Kreyenbroek read this as kilisyd, 'the Church, the Christians' (i.e. for e'KKA77t'a), but it is perhaps better emended to klstyd'n, as in Kirdir's inscription. Similar spellings are found elsewhere in Zoroastrian literature (Zand T Wahman- Yasn 3.26, 6.3, 5, 6; Dinkard VII 7.2, 47), in passages where 'Christian' is at least a possible translation, but the question is complicated by Avestan karosani- (Yasna 9.24), evidently a proper name cognate with Vedic krdanu-, rendered by a MP spelling which, though unclear in our manuscripts, the medieval Sanskrit translator clearly understood to mean 'Christian' (see Unvala, 1924: 37-8, with a long footnote). There is thus evidently a long-standing confusion between Avestan karosanT- and the loanword kristiydn. 30 For the etymology (not from Iranian zand-, but from Aramaic zaddik) see my article 'Zindik' in E12. 31 Bailey (1980: 7-10; 1983: 907-8) saw here an Iranian root *mak-, supposedly 'wash, moisten', which (in Bailey's view) underlies Armenian mk-rt-em, 'I baptize'; *maktak- thus means 'baptized' and refers to the Baptist community into which Manes was born (i.e. Elchasaites). But this alleged root has no unambiguous reflex in Iranian (Gignoux compares MP makdg, 'cup, boat', but I think this comes from Akkadian maqqdi, 'libation vessel'; see JRAS 1999, 160-1). More importantly, *mak-ta-ka- would yield MP *maxtag, which would have been written with -h-, not -k-. Sundermann (1977 [1980]: 241-2) also identified the mktky with Babylonian Baptists, but he derived it from Syriac mnakk6d, 'the purified ones', the name which Theodore bar Konay gives explicitly to the sect in which Manes was brought up, via *mmakk6&amp;a, with the Iranian suffix -ag. Frye (1967: 83) suggested that mktky is a scribal error for *mntky, a rather strange spelling for Aramaic manddy-, 'Mandaean', again with Iranian -ag, while de Menasce (1945: 244), and others after him, identified it with Sanskrit mukta-, 'liberated'. As such it would not refer per se to any particular Indian sect, but seeing that Kirdir has already mentioned Buddhists and Brahmanists, it has been argued (Widengren, 1965: 277) that this name might refer to the Jains. The three last-mentioned theories all share the difficulty that they assume that the Iranian suffix -ag was attached to a borrowed name, something for which there seems to be no parallel in Middle Persian. It is true that sometimes the MP relative ending -tg is added, pleonastically, to a name that already has the Aramaic relative suffix -dy, e.g. in inscriptional MP hrwm'dyk (hromdy- Ig), 'Roman', but this is not the same as adding the semantically more-or-less otiose (originally diminutive) suffix -ag to a foreign adjective like mnakk6a. Manichaean Parthian zmbwdyg, 'the world', appears to have added -g to an Indian loanword (Old Indian jambudvipa-; the Parthian word assumes a form like Prakrit jaribud-va-, Turner no. 5134), but here -yg is perhaps only graphic for -? Against the Jain theory one must object further that mukta- ought (one thinks) to be written with mw- in MP; also it seems strange that the Jains should be called by the Sanskrit term mukta- (rather than a Middle Indian form like Pali/Prakrit mutta-, Turner no. 10151), while the Buddhists and Brahmanists have Middle Indian names.</page><page sequence="7">THE RELIGIOUS VOCABULARY OF CHRISTIANITY AND OF ISLAM 7 it would consequently seem likely that mktky and zandik are also a pair, presumably designating two groups within Manichaeism. In this case I can only suggest that the isolated form mktky, which we read in one of the three copies of Kirdir's text (the other two being broken at this point), is perhaps a scribal error for mztky or mstky, either one of which would be an acceptable MP spelling for Aramaic mzaddek, ' one who justifies, one who declares another just, one who gives alms', which would be a plausible name for the Manichaean auditors, those whose principal task is precisely to give alms to the electi, the 'just ones' (zaddi.ke). Thus, *mzaddek and zadd.k (MP zandik) would be the two components of the Manichaean church, the auditors and the electi. I make this proposal with the hesitation imposed by the fact that mzaddek is not actually attested in this meaning in any Aramaic document.32 Be this as it may, the juxtaposition of nasray and kristiydn speaks against the not intrinsically unlikely view that ndsray here means 'Mandaeans '.33 'Mandaeans' and 'Christians' are not a particularly plausible pair. It seems most likely that these names are used here in the same way as 'Nazoraeans' and 'Christians' are in authors of the fourth century and later, that is, to designate two factions within the followers of Christ who differed in particular concerning circumcision and other aspects of the Mosaic law. nasray would 32 I have been tempted to see corroboration for this hypothetical reading in two Arabic passages referring to Manichaeans. The first is al-Jahiz, at-Tarbi'u wa t-tadwtr, ed. Pellat, 77 (par. 128), where, in the course of a polemic against the zanadiqah (here clearly: Manichaeans), the author says that we have seen 'al-musaddiqiyyata wa d-dtnilwariyyata wa t-tuyuzyuziyyah', evidently three subdivisions within Manichaeism. al-musaddiqiyyah would indeed correspond to Aramaic mzaddek. Pellat (p. 28 of the French section) suggests two possible emendations: one (which he adopts in the edition itself) is to read al-mazdaqiyyah ('Mazdakites '), supposedly corrupted in oral dictation to al-masdaqiyyah, a proposal that has little in its favour; the other is to read al-miqldsiyyah, the name of a Manichaean faction mentioned not only by an-Nadim (as Pellat noted), but also by 'Abd al-Jabbar and in a Sogdian text (references and discussion in E12, s.v. 'zindlk '). The latter emendation is not difficult graphically and makes excellent sense of the passage: the Manichaeans are divided here into the Miqlasi faction in Babylonia, the Denawars in Sogdiana, and the Manichaeans among the Uighurs, alias Tughughuz. (See also, with a slightly different interpretation, Sundermann's article ' Dinavar' in Encyclopaedia Iranica.) The second is in al-Mas'udi's Murfiju 6-6ahab (ed. Barbier/Pavet i, 200; ed. Pellat i, 109-10), where the printed text has musaddiq twice, but both times in corrupt contexts. The first part of the passage reads as follows in the old edition (with variants from the Taymtiriyyah ms., as cited in Pellat's edition): The gist of the passage seems to be that the Manichaeans shared the names for some of the ranks of their hierarchy with the Christians, whereas others are particular to Manichaeism. The Arabic names of the five Manichaean ranks are given by an-Nadim, al-Fihrist, 396, as: al-mu'allimnm, 'teachers', al-sammasln (read thus), 'bishops' (but in Christian usage: 'deacons'), al-qisstsmn, ' priests', as-siddfqin, 'elect', as-samma'fn, ' auditors'. So I would translate the cited passage from al-Mas'tidi as: 'The terms al-qissTs and ai-dammds and some others are (taken by the Christians) from (read: 'an) the Manichaeans, not (however) *as-siddfqjin and *as-sammd' and some others, this despite the fact that Mani came forth after the death of Christ'. The author then goes on to say that Bardesanes and Marcion also lived after Christ and that 'later the musaddiqiyyah and others who (likewise) follow the path of dualism branched off from them', but I suspect that here, as in the passage from al-Jahiz, al-musaddiqiyyah is a scribal error for al-miqlisiyyah. 33 In the secondary literature it has been argued that Kirdir's nasraiy cannot be Mandaean because the Mandaeans are not mentioned by any author before Theodore bar Kbnfy (in the late eighth century). But the evident strong Iranian influence on Mandaeism (Middle Iranian loan words, Zoroastrian religious influences, Mandaean use of the Persian calendar in its late Sasanian form, etc.) argues in favour of the assumption that the Mandaeans existed in their present location in southern Babylonia already in Sasanian times.</page><page sequence="8">8 FRAN(OIS DE BLOIS thus designate one group (or more) of 'Jewish Christians' and kristiydn one group (or more) of Pauline Christians. I doubt if one can be more precise than that.34 In the Syriac dictionaries it is stated that nacsraya means, among other things, 'Christian ',35 and in the modern secondary literature it has even been claimed that it is the 'usual' Aramaic designation for Christians.36 But one does not need to have very much experience of reading Syriac texts to know that the usual Syriac word for 'Christian' is in fact kristydn,3 plural kristyane. We do find ndsrdyd, in the singular, as an epithet of Jesus, translating Nagap-qvds and NaSwpaCos of the Greek Bible. The plural ndsraye renders the Nawpacot of Acts 24:5, and is employed in the heresiographical literature both for 'Jewish Christian' Nazoraeans38 and for Mandaeans.39 There are also a small number of passages in late Syriac authors which, in evident or apparent dependence on Arabic sources, use ndsraye, like Arabic nasard, to mean 'Christian '.40 And even in early works one can find the odd passage where 'Nazoraean' is a circumlocution for 'Christian'.41 But this does not make it the 'usual' Syriac word. On the other hand, there are a number of places where nisrdye- is used not as a Christian self-designation, but in statements which Christian authors put into the mouths of non-Christians. Most of the attestations are in the acts of the Persian martyrs, where it is the persecuting Zoroastrians who refer to their Christian victims as Nazoraeans. A very characteristic passage is in the story of Saint Pethion: the persecutors ask the saint whether he is the 'head of the Nazoraeans' (re~ci 6-nasrdye), whereupon the latter replies quite emphatically 'I am not the head of the Nazoraeans, no, I am a servant of God and the minister of the Christians (kristymdn)'.42 Or again in the history of Pseudo- Zacharias,43 where a Persian general, fearing defeat at the hands of Justinian's 34 de Menasce (1945: 207-8) suggested that kristiyan here means 'Marcionites'. It is very likely that Marcionites were encompassed in Kirdir's kristiydn, and indeed possible that Marcionites (and not proto-catholics) were the main representatives of Pauline Christianity in Persia at the end of the third century, but the Syriac texts cited by de Menasce do not support his claim that it was only Marcionites who used the name 'Christian' at the time in question. Brock's interpretation of Kirdir's inscriptions will be discussed below. 35See Payne Smith and Brockelmann, s.v., with textual references. 36 e.g. Chaumont, 1988: 113: 'Il est bien connu que nasrayd [sic] (plur. nasrayj [sic]) est la d6signation usuelle des chr6tiens dans les Eglises de langue aram6enne', etc. Spelt krystyn and krystyn. I use the above transcription for both. 38 Theodore bar Kona-y, ii, 301, 302. But these flimsy accounts of the Nazoraeans derive entirely from the Anacephalaiosis of Pseudo-Epiphanius. 3 Theodore, ii, 345, says that the 'Dositheans' (distayi) are called mndy' in Mesene, but nsry' in BeW Armaye, and proceeds to give a tolerably coherent account of the doctrines that we find also in Mandaean scriptures. 40 The passage in Bar Hebraeus Chron. Syr., ed. Bruns, 58 (= ed. Bedjan, 53; cf. his Arabic chronicle, ed. Pococke, 123), which quotes Galen's opinion of the Christians (here: nasraye), derives from a passage in Ibn al-Qifti's Arabic biography of Galen (see, in detail, Walzer, 1949: 92-3), nasrdyI is thus here merely a transcription of Arabic nasadr and must not mislead us into thinking that Galen actually referred to Christians as Na~wpaotL. The same seems to be the case when the Maronite Chronicle and Michael the Syrian both speak (with similar wording) of how the young Manes pretended to follow the doctrine of the nasrdye, in a context where this can only mean 'Christians '; see Klein, 1997 (with a different interpretation), and my comments, JRAS 1999 441-2. In the preface to the Didascalia, ed. V66bus, 10, in a flight of high rhetoric, the apostles address the Christian believers with the words o naisraye mshaye~, but elsewhere in the same book Christians are consistently referred to as kristyane. The preface is missing in the older version of the Syriac Didascalia (see V6Obus's translation, 36*-37*) and this, and the fact that the quoted phrase inevitably reminds one of the usual Arabic words for 'Christians', i.e. nasara and masThiyyin, suggest that here too we might have to do with a translation from the Arabic. 42 Corluy, 1888: 16. 43 Ps.-Zacharias, ed. Brooks, ii, 95 (lib. IX, cap. 4). Compare also ii, 28 (lib. VII, cap. 4), which tells of how the Sasanian king Kawad, after taking Amid, enters the church and sees an icon of Jesus; on asking who this might be, he is told (presumably by his Persian entourage) that it is the 'god of the Nazoraeans' (aliha 6-nasrayJ).</page><page sequence="9">THE RELIGIOUS VOCABULARY OF CHRISTIANITY AND OF ISLAM 9 commander Belesarius, sends a message to the Romans asking to delay battle until after Easter/Passover, 'for the sake of the Nazoraeans (ndsrdye) and Jews who are in my army, and for your sake, you who are Christians (kristyane)'. From passages like this Horovitz44 drew the conclusion that Syriac nasraye is a designation 'der Christen tiberhaupt, oder vielleicht richtiger der Christen des persischen Reiches im Gegensatz zu denen, welche der ostr6mischen Herrschaft unterstanden'. A similar line of reasoning has more recently been pursued (without reference to Horovitz) by Wiessner,45 and then again (without mentioning either Horovitz's or Wiessner's contribution) by Brock.46 From the fact that in Syriac texts the term ndsraye is 'invariably' put into the mouths of non-Christians Brock deduced that it is the name by which 'the non- Christians in the Sassanid empire referred to Christians' and that consequently also the nasrdy of Kirdir's inscription 'must refer to the native Christian population' of the Persian empire, while his kristiyadn designates 'Christians of western origin, that is to say Christians who had been deported to Persia'. In my opinion, this argumentation involves various difficulties, both from a Syriac and from an Iranian point of view. First of all, there is a passage in the Romance of Julian the Apostate,47 noted already by Horovitz, where the pagans of Harran are said to express their fear that after Julian's departure from their town they might be afflicted by 'the dark night of Nazoraeism (ndsrayuii ) '. Thus, it is not only Persian pagans whom the Syriac authors depict as calling the Christians 'Nazoraeans', but also the pagans of Syria. Second, if the non-Christians in the Sasanian empire really referred to Christians as nasraye, then one must ask why in the whole corpus of Middle Persian literature the word ndsr7y occurs only once, namely in the mentioned inscription of Kirdir. In fact, the well-known Persian word for 'Christian', in the common usage of Christians, Zoroastrians and later of Muslims, is Middle Persian tarsag,48 Neo-Persian tarsd '(God) fearer'.49 This Persian usage is 44 Horovitz, 1926: 144-6. It might be noted that the transcribed Syriac quotations on these pages contain a fair number of mistakes, especially 'nasraje ' (sic passim), for nds-, and 'krestjane', for -t-. 45 Wiessner, 1967: 294, n. 32: 'Die vielleicht naheliegendste Annahme ist diejenige, in den nasaraye aramaiisch-christliche, in den korestayyndn griechisch-christliche Gemeinschaften zu sehen'. 46 Brock, 1974: 91-5. 47 ed. Hoffmann, 146. 48 MP tarsag is well attested, in the meaning 'Christian', in Zoroastrian texts. It does not seem to be found in the hitherto published Western Iranian Manichaean texts, but D. Durkin informs me that the unpublished fragment M 15 V 1 contains the words pd trs'gyy, 'in fear/piety'. 49 For the background of tarsig (tarsd), compare the thought-provoking article by Pines on 'The Iranian name for Christians' (Pines, 1968) where these, and also Mandaic d'h'ly', are connected with the 'God fearers' (ckoP3oVtEvot 6ov &amp;EOd, alias Efo6tpEVOL) mentioned several times in the Acts of the Apostles, Juvenal's metuentes, etc., a much-discussed designation for gentiles who believed in the god of the Jews without actually converting to Judaism, and who were among the prime targets of Paul's preaching. In my view, when the Iranian Christians decided to call themselves tarsagdn they were, in all probability, indeed likening themselves to the pogot5iLEVOL mentioned in the Bible, but, unlike Pines, I think it unlikely that there was actually any historical connection between the first Persian Christians and the 'God fearers' of the primitive church. Also, the linking (with Nildeke, Pines and others) the Arabic rahib, pl. ruhbdn, 'monk' (ostensibly a participle of the verb r-h-b, 'to fear'), with Persian tarsdg, seems semantically tenuous; whereas the Persian term encompasses the Christians as a whole, the Arabic word has a much narrower meaning. It might be better to rehabilitate (at least in part) Geiger's (1833: 51) connection of the Arabic word for 'monk' with some derivative of Aramaic rabb, 'lord, master, religious teacher'; I would suggest that the Arabic plural ruhbdn comes from the (reduplicated) Syriac plural rawrfline (also rabbanF, etc.), either with dissimilation of r-r- to r-h-, or by popular etymological attachment to the (Arabic, not Aramaic) root r-h-b, with back-formation of the singular rihib. In support of this it could be noted that the juxtaposition of 'ahbdr and ruhbdn in Quran 9:31 and 34 seems to parallel that of rabbdniyyin and 'ahbdr in 5:44 and 63. By way of curiosity, Colin (1960-63: 13-14) derived Arabic ruhbdn from the rihbin which he found in some Persian dictionary, supposedly meaning 'protecting piety' or the like. In fact, the fake Persian words rihbin and rkh (supposedly = Arabic zuhd, but apparently inspired by Arabic rilh) were invented by the iu'fibi philologists specifically to provide a 'Persian' etymology for Arabic ruhbdn.</page><page sequence="10">10 FRANCOIS DE BLOIS reflected in another of the anti-Christian passages in the Mandaean Ginza, which says that the followers of Christ are called 'fearers' (d'h'ly'), 'righteous ones' (z'dyqy') and 'Christians' (krysty'ny').50 The passage is presumably directed specifically against the Persian-speaking Christians of the Sasanian empire, as opposed to the previously quoted Mandaean polemic against those Christians who worship the 'god of the Nazoraeans'. This suggests that also in Persian usage tarsiagan and kristiyan are interchangeable names for Pauline Christians, as opposed to Nazoraeans (ndsray). Similarly, in the Choresmian glosses to az-Zamaxgari's Muqaddimatu 1-'adab, Arabic nasrdan- (nasara) is translated as trs'k and trs'k'nk.51 And in Sogdian the name 'Christian' is very well attested, both in (Nestorian) Christian and in Manichaean texts, as tarsak, tarsakane and tarsakanc'.52 In one text we do find the term n'sr'yq; this is in the Sogdian translation (from the Syriac, which in turn derives from the Greek) of the Life of St George, where a demon, exorcised by the saint, calls in his despair upon the 'Nazoraean', that is Jesus.53 It is thus clear that neither in Middle Persian nor in Sogdian is 'Nazoraean' ever used as a Christian self- designation, nor even as a name with which followers of other faiths refer to catholic Christians.54 In the light of this one must search for a different explanation for the Syriac usage. I would suggest that when Syriac authors depict their non- Christian opponents as calling the Christians 'Nazoraeans', they are in fact using a literary topos, that is to say consciously alluding to Acts 24:5. This seems particularly likely in the cited passage from the life of Pethion, when the Persians accuse the saint of being the 'head of the Nazoraeans' (ria- 6-nisraye); compare the Syriac version of Acts 24:5, where Paul's opponents call him precisely the ' head (rida) of the sect of the Nazoraeans '. ' Nazoraeans ' are what Christians are supposed to be called by their enemies. As for the passage in Pseudo-Zacharias, although this could be cited as evidence that the Persians called the followers of Jesus in their own country 'Nazoraeans', but those in the Byzantine empire 'Christians', it could also be understood differ- ently, namely as indicating that the Syriac author, in his account of the alleged Sasanian diplomatic initiative, naturally did not think it appropriate to depict the Persians as applying the insulting term 'Nazoraean' to the addressees of their message. Real Persians spoke Persian, not Syriac, and presumably used the loanword kristiyan (as in Kirdir's inscription) as well as the Persian tarsag both for their own Christians and for those on foreign soil. It is only in Christian church literature that they are depicted as aping the words of Paul's persecutors. In the Armenian Bible we find nazovrec'i, reflecting Naowpacos (with the Armenian ending -ec'i), but translating both this and the synonymous Nagapnov6s. In one work, the history of the Armenian-Sasanian war by Elise, and nowhere else in Old Armenian, there are several occurrences of the plural 50 Ginza (right) 55. 51 az-Zamaxiarl 11:4,6; 466:3. 52 For spellings and references, see Gharib, 1995: no. 9667-9675. The word is evidently a borrowing from Western Iranian (Middle Persian or Parthian). 53 The n'sr'yq of the Sogdian version (Hansen, 1941, i, 249) corresponds to either lio' or nasrdy&amp; in the extant Syriac manuscripts (Brooks, 1925: 89 apu) and to 'Is7ao Natapsjvd in the Greek original. 54 In one of the Sasanian papyri edited by Weber (1992: text P 61), the editor read 9mwyl (...)

Similarly, the supposedly Christian personal names which Weber read as ncwlyk' and nclyk' are more likely to be ws(w)lgk', presumably a hypocoristicon from a compound name with first element wuzurg-.</page><page sequence="11">THE RELIGIOUS VOCABULARY OF CHRISTIANITY AND OF ISLAM 11 noun nacrac'ik', as the word for 'Christians' in alleged quotations of speeches by Zoroastrian Persians, exactly like Syriac nasraye in similar contexts.55 Lacking other occurrences of this form, we must suspect that these supposed quotations derive from a source in Syriac and that nacrac'ik' is simply an ad hoc transposition of the Syriac word. The Malayalam term nasrdni, plural nasranikal, 'Christian ',56 which vari- ous writers on the history of Christianity in India have considered to be of great antiquity, and which the author of the article 'Nasara.' in E12 thinks, for some reason, to be relevant to the understanding of the Arabic word, is in fact manifestly borrowed (directly or indirectly) from Arabic nasrant. The usage in languages other than Arabic (and those which borrowed their word for 'Christian' from Arabic) can thus be summarized as follows: Nazoraean (or Nazarene) is, first of all, the epithet of Jesus, the man of Nazareth. In the plural, Nazoraeans is a contemptuous name for Christians, put into the mouths of their enemies in Acts 24:5, and then, in imitation of the biblical passage, in some Syriac accounts (and one Armenian account) of the anti-Christian activities of Zoroastrians and others. But it is apparently also the name actually used by Jews in the first two or three centuries to designate the followers of Jesus, and specifically the Christians in the syn- agogue, and thus also by at least some of these Jewish Christians themselves. And it is in this sense, as a designation for certain Jewish Christians, that the name is applied by catholic Christian polemicists, by the Zoroastrian high priest Kirdir, and finally in Mandaean writings, where it occurs both in polemics against the Nazoraeans, and as a self-designation of the Nazoraean converts to Mandaeism. This brings us at last to Arabic nasrant, plural nasara. That this name is connected with the town of Nazareth, in Arabic an-Nasirah, was recognized by most of the medieval Arabic philologists, though it was equally clear to them that nasrant is not easy to explain in terms of Arabic word formation; modern scholars have also failed, as far as I can see, to account adequately for the Arabic form. It can, in any case, hardly be derived either from Aramaic nasray- or from Hebrew nosr-, and one must consequently reject the occasional claim that the Muslims had their word for 'Christian' from the Jews. Aramaic can derive adjectives from nouns by means of the suffixes -ay or -anay, in both cases normally with reduction of any a in the root (first to short a and then, in open syllables, to zero/gwa).57 For example the name of the town HIarran forms the adjective har(ro)nandy-58, borrowed into Arabic as harnanl. The adjective from Nas(a)raO, *Nas(a)ra, 'Nazareth', is attested in Syriac as nasray- (thus vocalized in the Pi1tta, with retention of the long d), but *nasrdnay- would also be a correct Aramaic formation, which could have been borrowed into Arabic as nasrant. But the fact that *nasranay- is not attested in any Aramaic dialect is a serious obstacle to this etymology. On the other hand, in Arabic the ending -anf is used, without affecting the vocalism of the stem, typically to form adjectives implying copious possession of some quality, e.g. fa'rant, 'hirsute', from sa'r, 'hair'. Thus, from a purely Arabic point of view 5 See Thomson's translation, 80, n. 5: 'It is important that Elishe only uses the term in the mouth of a Persian. (...) The word is not found in other early Armenian authors'. 56 Gundert, 1872: 537, where it is glossed 'A Nazarene, Syrian or Syro-roman Christian', and (wrongly) derived from Syriac. 57 See Brockelmann, 1908-13: i, 397-400; Ndldeke, 1898: par. 135-6. Brockelmann explains the reduction of the long vowel of the stem as dissimilation of a before the a of the suffix. 58 Syriac script has no way of indicating either the gemination or the reduced vowel. It is thus difficult to determine whether at any particular stage in the history of the language the name was pronounced harrondndy- or harnindy-.</page><page sequence="12">12 FRAN(OIS DE BLOIS nasrant looks like an intensive adjective from nasr, '(divine) help, victory', and could consequently be thought to mean something like 'having received much aid from God'. As such it could conceivably represent an attempt by the ancient Arab Christians to re-etymologize Aramaic na.sray- (or *nasray-) as an Arabic nasranT, in the same way that they re-etymologized the biblical name Yuhanna, ' John', as Arabic Yahya, 'he lives '.59 The Arabic lexica adduce for 'Christian' also the form nasran, which, if authentic, could be interpreted as an adjective from the verbal root n-s-r, 'to help', then with the regular plural nasara, like sakrdn, plural sakarad, from s-k-r, 'to be drunk', or kaslin, plural kasdld, from k-s-l, 'to be lazy '. Or else, nasrant was reinterpreted as a nisbah from *nasradn, and a plural was formed from the assumed simple form.60 Scholars have not failed to remark on the affinity of the Arabic word for 'Christian' with the name of the sect of the Nazoraeans and it has more than once been suggested that the Christians of ancient Arabia might have included a contingent of Nazoraeans or that they might for some other reason have taken the name of that sect.61 But the possibility that the nasara of the Quran were Nazoraeans, pure and simple, has not seemed a very attractive one. For one thing, Muslim authors of the Abbasid period frequently and unambigu- ously give the name nasara to the well-known Nicene (catholic) denominations (Melkites, Jacobites and Nestorians) and it is used also as a self-designation of members of those churches when writing in Arabic.62 For another, at the time of Muhammad,63 even if 'Jewish Christianity' had not died out com- pletely, it was very much a marginal phenomenon. The Nicene creed was not only firmly established in the Mediterranean world, but also well entrenched on the fringes of the Arabian desert, at the courts of the Ghassanids and Lakhmids, and in Nagrin. But, although these objections are weighty, they are not decisive. To begin with, although contemporary Christian sources give fairly extensive documentation of the catholic presence in peripheral Arabia, Central Arabia is pretty much blank on the map of seventh-century Christianity, suggesting that any Christians in the Hijaz were not in fact members of the catholic churches. Second, usage in the Arabic of the Abbasid period is not necessarily indicative of that in early Arabic. The Quran contains a good number of words that were not used, and no longer understood in later times, or that were employed in quite different meanings. It is possible that when, following the conquest of Byzantine and Sasanian territories, the 9 The occasional attempts to explain quranic Yahyfi as a scribal error for Yuhanna are misguided. Mandaic y'hy' is evidently a late form, borrowed from Arabic, alongside the older ywh'n' (see Drower and Macuch, 1963: 185, 190; Horovitz, 1926: 151-2). It might be mentioned that Arabic and Persian speaking Christians likewise not rarely use the Islamic forms of names like Yahyi or 'Isa even in their own sectarian writings, for example in the (wrongly) so-called 'Persian Diatessaron'. 60 For the formation of the plural nasard, and for virtually nothing else, I am in broad agreement with Horovitz, 1926: 144-6. 61 Wellhausen (1887: 200) writes: ' Man darf natuirlich bei dem Christentum, welches in Arabien eindrang, nicht an das officielle und orthodoxe der Byzantiner denken. Arabia ferax haereseon. Man hat sich obskure Sekten vorzustellen, die, von dem Hauptstrome der Kirchengeschichte unergriffen, die Entwicklung unter klassischem Einfluss nicht mitgemacht hatten, sondern auf primitiven Stufen stehen geblieben und dem Judentum noch niher verwandt waren. Schon der Name Naq^ra weist darauf hin'. In the corresponding passage in Wellhausen, 1897: 232, this has been toned down somewhat: 'Der Orient war monophysitisch oder nestorianisch. Daneben gab es grade an der Grenze des Culturlandes und der Wiste, z.B. in Ostpalistina, noch manche obskure Secte. (...) Auch durch diese wurden die Araber mit dem Christentum bekannt; der Name Naqira, mit dem sie es bezeichneten, ist ein Sectenname'. Both formulations seem to me to be very close to the truth, like so much else in this giant from the heroic age of Oriental studies. 62 This is commonplace in medieval Christian Arabic. Even the Maltese, who for a long time now have not lived under Muslim rule, say nisrani, pl. nsara, for 'Christian', a distinctly Muslim usage, like ir-randan (Arabic Ramadhn), for 'lent'. 3 For a discussion of the time and place of the origin of Islam see below, section 3.</page><page sequence="13">THE RELIGIOUS VOCABULARY OF CHRISTIANITY AND OF ISLAM 13 Muslims came into extensive contact with catholic Christians, they decided to transfer the quranic name nasara to these Christians, while the Christians, for their part, would have been happy to adopt this name, at least when speaking to Muslims, in Arabic, so as to lay claim to the status of 'ahlu 1-kitab. The possibility that the nasara of the Quran were not catholic Christians, but Nazoraean 'Jewish Christians', is suggested not only by their Arabic name, but also by what the Quran has to say about Christians. I should like to concentrate on two points, the first being the quranic rejection of the doctrine of the trinity. The relevant passages are the following: (an-Nisa' 4:171): Oh people of the book! Do not exaggerate your religion and do not speak of god other than the truth. The Christ, 'Isa son of Maryam, is only god's emissary and his word, which he cast towards Maryam, and a spirit from him. So believe in god and his emissaries and do not say: three.64 (al-Md'idah 5:73): Verily, those ones were unbelievers who said that god is the third of three.65 And two verses later (5:75): The Christ, the son of Maryam, is only an emissary, in advance of whom the (other) emissaries have passed away, and his mother is a righteous woman, the two of whom used to eat food.66 (al-Ma'idah 5:116): When god said: 'Oh 'Isa son of Maryam! Didst thou say to men: Take me and my mother as two gods apart from god?', ('Isa) said: 'Be thou exalted (above that)! It is not for me to say that to which I am not entitled.'.67 (al-Jinn 72:3): And (it was revealed to me) that the good fortune of our lord was elevated, (for) he did not take for himself a consort, nor a child.68 From these passages the Muslim commentators drew the inevitable conclusion that Christians believe in three deities: god, the Christ and the Christ's mother.69 In 5:116 Jesus himself has to deny that he taught men to believe that he and his mother are 'two gods apart from god', and in 5:73-75 the notion that god is one of three is repudiated by the statement that the other two members of the alleged trinity, the Christ and his mother, 'used to eat food'; compare this with Luke 7:34: 'the son of man has come eating and drinking, and you say: Behold a gluttonous man and a drunkard'. Thus, the Quran rebuts trinitarian- ism with Jesus's own words, in one case taken from the canonic gospels. Moreover, in 72:3 it is thought necessary to reject the idea that god had a consort (sdhibah) and a child. Of course, catholic Christians do not believe that Jesus's mother is a deity, or part of the trinity, nor that god has a wife. Consequently the majority of Western scholars have assumed either that Muhammad grossly misunderstood 64 yd 'ahla l-kitabi li taylii ft dinikum wa 1i taqdlMi 'al lilhi 'illa l-haqqa 'innamda -masihu 'Tsa bnu maryama rasilu lilIhi wa kalimatuhi 'alqhha 'ila maryama wa rihun minhu fa 'aminii bi lihi wa rusulihY wa li taqili Oala8atun. 65 laqad kafara lla6mna qali 'inna llaha 8OdliOu 8ald8atin. 66 m l-masthu bnu maryama 'illi rastilun qad xalat min qablihi r-rusulu wa 'ummuhbi siddtqatun kdnd ya'kulini t-ta'dm. 67 wa 'i6 qaallihu yd 'Tsa bna maryama 'a'anta qulta li n-ndsi ttaxi6~int wa 'ummt 'ilihayni min diini lidhi qdla subhinaka md yakinu IT 'an 'aqiila md laysa 17 bi haqqin. 68 wa annah u ta'lli jaddu rabbind md ttaxa6a sdihibatan wa li waladan.

But a few scholars have considered the possibility that the quranic polemic is directed not against catholic Christians, but against some sect that actually believed these things.70 As a possible candidate a number of authors have referred to Epiphanius' account7" of 'some women in Thrace, Scythia and [the Roman province of] Arabia' who adored Mary as a goddess and offered her a certain cake (KoAAvpea rTwd), hence their name 'Collyridians'. But there is no indication that these people regarded Mary as part of a trinity, or that they saw her as god's consort. Moroever, since nothing seems to link these female devotees to 'Jewish Christianity', the hypothetical localization of Collyridians in seventh- century Hijaz does not help us with the identification of the quranic nasara. I should like therefore to follow a different trail, one which leads directly to the Nazoraeans of Christian heresiographers. The best known of the so-called Jewish Christian groups are the Elchasaites. Hippolytus, writing around the year 230, says that the Elchasaites taught that god was assisted by two angels of gigantic size, one of them male, called the 'son of god', and one female, 'the holy spirit'.72 We remind ourselves that the Semitic word for 'spirit' (riuh, etc.) is feminine. A century and a half later Epiphanius also mentions Elchasai's two giants and says in three passages that the male and female entities were identified as Christ and the holy spirit respectively,73 adding in one passage74 that the Elchasaites called the holy spirit Christ's sister. And the Muslim scholar an-Nadim, in his account of the Elchasaites, or muytasilah, in southern Iraq, also says that these believed that 'the two existences (kawnayn) are male and female'."7 If Hippolytus is right in saying that they called the male being the 'son of god', and if Epiphanius is right in claiming that they identified the two giants as 'Christ' and 'Christ's sister' respectively, it follows that the Elchasaites taught that the holy spirit is the daughter of god. This is not identical with the view condemned in the Quran, but it is close to it. We come even closer with the information that Jerome gives us about the Nazoraeans in Palestine and their version of the gospel. The famous translator 70 For a survey of the literature see Henninger, 1951: 51-6, where this line of enquiry is rejected. Already in 1734, Sale, in the 'Preliminary discourse' to his English translation of the Quran (reprint 1850: 25) claimed that the 'notion of the divinity of the virgin Mary was also believed by some at the council of Nice [Nicaea], who said there were two gods besides the Father, viz. Christ and the virgin Mary, and were thence named Mariamites', and that 'this foolish imagination is justly condemned in the Koran as idolatrous, and gave a handle to Mohammed to attack the Trinity itself'. For these ' Mariamites' he referred to the tenth-century Arabic chronicle of the Melkite patriarch of Alexandria Eutychius, alias Sa'id b. al-Bitriq (ed. Selden and Pococke, i, 440; ed. Cheikho, i, 126). In fact, no early source mentions such a sect. Moreover, it ought to have been clear that the doctrinal formulation which Eutychius ascribes to them (fa minhum man kana yaqiilu 'inna 1-mastha wa 'ummahRi 'ildhayni [sic] min diini Ildhi wa humu 1-burburdniyyatu [Borborians? Hardly 'barbari' as Selden and Pococke have it] wa yusammawna 1-maryamiyytn) is lifted more or less verbatim from Quran 5:116. It is thus likely that Eutychius (or his source) has invented the' maryamiyyin ' precisely to deflect the quranic polemic from catholic Christianity. A much deeper scholar than Sale, the Huguenot Isaac de Beausobre, in a book printed in the very same year (de Beausobre, 1734: i, 532-3), observed that Eutychius' Mariamites are a 'secte imaginaire' and that 'jamais aucune Secte Chretienne n'a fait de Marie une troisieme Personne Divine', that is to say, a member of the trinity. He suggested moreover that the inventor of the ' Mariamites' had simply misunderstood reports of how the Nazoraeans regarded the holy spirit to be Christ's mother and had confused her with Mary. Unfortunately, Beausobre did not know Arabic and consequently failed to notice the textual similarity between Eutychius and the Quran; otherwise he might very well have anticipated the conclusion spelt out in the following paragraphs of this article. 71 Panarion 79. 72 Refutatio omnium haeresium 9,13,2-3 (K/R 114). 73 Panarion 19,4,1-2; 30,17,6; 53,1,9 (K/R 158, 186, 196). 74 Panarion 53,1,9 (K/R 196). 75 Fihrist, 404; see de Blois, 1995: 58-9.</page><page sequence="15">THE RELIGIOUS VOCABULARY OF CHRISTIANITY AND OF ISLAM 15 of the Latin Bible claims on several occasions that he had access to a copy of the 'Gospel according to the Hebrews', which the Nazoraeans read 'in Hebrew', from which he quotes a number of extracts. One passage is quoted (with slight variants in the wording) no fewer than three times by Jerome, and twice already by the older Origen. We read here: 'But in the gospel written according to the Hebrews which the Nazoraeans read the lord says: Just now my mother, the holy spirit, lifed me up '.76 Origen gives the same quotation, again from the 'gospel according to the Hebrews', as: 'Just now my mother, the holy spirit, lifted me up by one of my hairs and brought me to the great mountain Thabor '.77 Thus, the holy spirit is Christ's mother. This is confirmed by another quotation which Jerome brings from 'the gospel which the Nazoraeans read, written in the Hebrew language', an account of Christ's baptism: 'And it came to pass when the lord came up out of the water, the whole fount of the holy spirit descended upon him and rested over him and said to him: My son (...), thou art my first-begotten son that reignest for ever '.' The conclusion that the Nazoraeans made the holy spirit Christ's mother is not negated by the fact that elsewhere Jerome quotes the 'gospel according to the Hebrews', 'which the Nazarenes use' as referring to Mary as 'mother of the lord' and also to 'his brothers '.79 It would appear that for the Nazoraeans Jesus had both a natural and a supernatural filiation. If we combine the Elchasaite material with the Nazoraean we can conclude that there was a widespread notion in 'Jewish Christian' circles of a trinity, a supernatural holy family, consisting of god the father, his son the Christ, and a female holy spirit, who is identified in one branch of the tradition as Christ's sister, but in another as his mother. Also in the 'Jewish Christian' material contained in the two extant versions of the fictitious autobiography of Clement of Rome (the Homilies and Recognitions) we have the idea that god is accom- panied by a supernatural male-female syzygy; here too the male syzygos is the cosmic prototype of Jesus, and of the other true prophets, but the female syzygos is no longer the holy spirit, but the principle of evil. This must be a special development in the sect represented by the Pseudo-Clementine writings. We have consequently in the Quran a large number of passages polemicizing against Christians of one sort or another, in many of which they are given the name nasiara, that is, ' Nazoraeans ', while in others they are accused of believing in an anthropomorphic trinity precisely of the type that Jerome attributed to the Nazoraeans in Palestine, a trinity consisting of god, his son the Christ, and Christ's mother. Thus, the name and the doctrines agree. The second point that I should like to raise concerns the quranic food regulations. In al-Mii'idah (5:5) god says to his people: 76 Jerome, in Esaiam 40,9 (K/R 224): 'sed et in euangelio quod iuxta hebraeos scriptum nazaraei lectitant dominus loquitur: modo me tulit mater mea spiritus sanctus'. 77 Origen in Johannem 2,12 (K/R 126): hp-r Et AaE' F E 47 q r7jT7qp I/ov T OV a t 7rV iLOV TVa Ev Etlt TPLX,V k OV Kai cXTtl7VEyKE' LE E'S 719 Tpo 7T6 OEya Oagcqp.

SJerome in Esaiam 11,2: 'sed iuxta euangelium quod hebraeo sermone conscriptum legunt nazaraei: descendit super eum omnis fons spiritus sancti. (...) porro in euangelio, cuius supra fecimus mentionem, haec scripta reperimus: factum est autem cum ascendisset dominus de aqua, descendit fons omnis spiritus sancti et requieuit super eum et dixit illi: fili mi, in omnibus prophetis exspectabam te ut uenires et requiescerem in te. tu es enim requies mea, tu es filius meus primogenitus qui regnas in sempiternum.' Although the two quotations are separated by other material, it is sufficiently clear from the context that the 'euangelium cuius supra fecimus mentionem' must be the 'euangelium quod legunt nazaraei' 79 Jerome adv. Pelag. 3,2 (K/R 226-8).</page><page sequence="16">16 FRAN(OIS DE BLOIS Today the good things have been permitted to you-and the food of those to whom the book was given is permitted to you and your food is permitted to them-and (likewise) the (legal) wives from amongst the believing (i.e. Muslim) women and the (legal) wives from amongst those to whom the book was given before you, provided you give them their wages (dowries) as (legal) husbands, not as fornicators nor as those who take lovers.80 'Those to whom the book was given' (with or without 'before you') is the usual quranic circumlocution for 'Jews and nasara'. The second part of the verse clearly means that Muslims are allowed to marry the women of these two communities and the implication of the first part is surely that Muslims are allowed to eat food prepared by Jews and nasarad, or considered clean by them. In the case of the Jews there is no difficulty with this, since Jews do not in fact eat any of the foods that are explicitly prohibited in the Quran (pork, carrion, etc.). Consequently, anything that Jews can eat can safely be regarded as permissible for Muslims as well. But if nasara means 'catholic Christians', then it is very difficult to see how their food should be 'permitted to you', seeing that the catholic canon contains statements to the effect that Jesus 'declared all food clean' (Mark 7:19) and that catholic Christians are notorious for their porcophagy. But if the nasdara of the Quran are indeed Nazoraeans, who observed the Jewish laws of purity, then the statement that 'the food of those to whom the book was given is permitted to you' would make very good sense. But the quoted quranic passage goes on to say that 'your food is permitted to them', a statement that is difficult to reconcile with the fact that the food taboos of the Jews (and presumably also of the Nazoraeans) are considerably more stringent than those of the Muslims. This would seem to suggest that this verse belongs to a stage in the development of Islam at which the Old Testament food regulations were strictly implemented and that passages like 6:146-7, where the Muslims are explicitly exempted from certain food restric- tions which god had previously imposed on the Jews, reflect a subsequent abrogation (nasx) of the divine revelation, in the same way that in 2:142-5 god orders the Muslims to abandon the direction of prayer of 'those to whom the book was given' and to pray towards the Ka'bah at Mecca. The picture that emerges is thus that at one stage, early in the history of Islam, Muslims, Jews and Nazoraeans all shared the same dietary restrictions.sl I suggest, in short, that one should seriously consider the possibility that the nasara of the Quran were indeed Nazoraeans and that it is consequently likely that there was a community of Nazoraean Christians in central Arabia, in the seventh century, unnoticed by the outside world. But this is a suggestion which would require reopening and re-evaluating the question of specifically 'Jewish Christian' influences on the original formulation of Islam.

What exactly is meant by muhsin (masc. act. part.) and muhsanah (femrn. pass. part.) is the subject of much debate, but they must mean something like' legal husbands' and' legal wives' respectively. 81 Quran 5:5 does not explicitly state that the people of the book cannot marry Muslim women, and indeed the verse could very well be understood to mean that what is true of food is also true of women, in other words that Muslims, Jews and Nazoraeans not only share the same table but are also allowed to intermarry. But this is rejected by the Muslim commentators and jurists.</page><page sequence="17">THE RELIGIOUS VOCABULARY OF CHRISTIANITY AND OF ISLAM 17 plural (hunaJ'f').82 In eight of its occurrences (2:135, 3:67, 3:95, 4:125, 6:79, 6:161, 16:120, 16:123) it refers explicitly to 'Ibrathim, the Abraham of the Bible, and in all but one of these the verse goes on to say that the hanTf Abraham was 'not one of the associators' (ma kana mina 1-musrikin, or words to that effect), that is to say, not one of the polytheists, who associate others with god.83 The one exception is 4:125, where we find a truncated doublet of 3:95, without the final period. In two of these verses the hanTf Abraham is also explicitly dissociated from Judaism and (Nazoraean) Christianity; 3:67 says: 'Abraham was not a Jew and not a Nazoraean, but he was hanif muslim, nor was he one of the associators'. And 2:135 declares: 'They said: Become Jews or Nazoraeans and find the path! But thou shalt say: No, (I obey) the religion of Abraham, who was a hanif, and he was not one of the associators '.84 The remaining four attestations (10:105, 22:31, 30:30, 98:5) do not explicitly mention Abraham, but they use the word in contexts otherwise similar to those men- tioned above. 10:105 and 22:31 repeat that the hanif is not an 'associator', 30:30 mirrors the language of 6:79 and of 10:105, while 98:5 is in the context of a polemic against the 'people of the book' (i.e. the Jews and Nazoraeans) and the ' associators'. The formulaic nature of these statements is underlined by the fact that the word, whether singular or plural, occurs always in the undetermined accusative case (hanifan, hunafa'a). There is no suggestion, at least not in the Quran, that there was ever a group of people, a religion, known as hunafti'. We are told only that Abraham, or some other person, or persons, was, or did something, 'in the state of a hanif'. The Quran commentators of the classical period reckoned the word hanif to be part of the yarTbu l-qur' n, that is to say, of those expressions the precise meaning of which was unknown and the interpretation of which was considered a legitimate subject of scholarly disagreement. In his great compendium of Islamic exegetical doctrine, the Jdimi'u 1-baydn 'an ta'wTli 1-qur'an, at-Tabari says (commenting on 2:135) that the exegetes had offered five explanations of 82 For the reader's convenience, I cite here in transcription all the occurrences of the word in the Quran: (al-Baqarah 2:135) wa qdllk kunu hiidan 'aw nasara tahtadki qul bal millata 'ibrihTma hanTfan wa ma kdna mina 1-mulrikin ('alu 'Imrdn 3:67) ma kana 'ibrahimu yahuidiyyan wa lia nasrdniyyan wa lakin kdna hanTfan musliman wa ma kana mina 1-musrikin ('alu 'Imran 3:95) qul sadaqa llahufa ttabi'it millata 'ibrdhima hanTfan wa ma kana mina 1-musrikin (al-Nisa' 4:125) (...) wa ttaba'a millata 'ibridhfma hanTfan (...)

Second, hanTf means 'obedient' (muttabi'; compare 16:123). Third, 'Abraham's religion is called al- hanTfiyyah because he was the first imam to prescribe circumcision for worship- pers', implying, it seems, that these authorities thought that hanif means 'circumcised'. Fourth, the hanTf is the person who 'devotes his religion to god alone' (al-muxlisu dinahii li lldhi wahdih; compare 98:5). And fifth, al-hanTfiyyah means al-'islim (compare 3:67, where Abraham is called hanif muslim). For his part, at-Tabari says that hanif actually means 'straight' (mustaqTm, inspired doubtless by 6:161, where the two words occur in some proximity to each other) and he supports this with a decidely bizarre etymology, connecting it with 'ahnaf, 'having a crooked foot, lame', whereby he tells us that this quite ordinary word actually means 'straight' and is applied to a person with a crooked foot only as a way of presaging his recovery from the ailment.85 The Arabic lexica repeat most of these options and add another, which has also found favour with some modern scholars: hanafa supposedly means 'it turned to one side, it bent'; the 'ahnaf is so called because his foot is bent to one side and the hanTf is the one who, like Abraham, turns to one side, away from the worship of idols. I am not sure that this etymology is really very much better than the one offered by at-Tabari, especially since it seems doubtful whether the verb hanafa is actually attested in classical Arabic in the alleged meaning.86 One suspects rather that this meaning was invented by the lexico- graphers to explain the quranic term. In post-quranic Arabic hanif is used quite commonly as a synonym for muslim, 'true believer'; the community of Muslims is called al-hanTfah and al- hanTfiyyah. It is certainly not implausible to understand the word in this way also in the context of the Quran: Abraham and all the other ancient prophets taught the same true religion as Muhammad; thus Abraham, like Muhammad, was a muslim, and the follower of Muhammad is, like Abraham, also a hanTf. The difficulty faced by Semitists, as by students of religious history, is that in other Semitic languages the root h-n-p is used in very different, intrinsically negative, meanings that seem quite irreconcilable with the usage in the Quran. It is best attested in Aramaic: Syriac has hanpa, very widely used in the sense 'pagan, non-Christian', hanpu0id, 'paganism', etc.8 In Babylonian and Palestinian Jewish Aramaic the root h-n-p carries the meaning 'to deceive, to flatter '.88 Mandaic has h'nypy', 'false gods', h'nypwt', 'worship of false gods', 85 qUla lahfi 'ahnafa nazran lahii 'ila s-saldmah. 86 Margoliouth, 1903: 478, cites a verse in one of the poems by al-'A'iS commemorating the victory of the Arab tribesmen over the Persians at 680 l-Qar, reading, in Cheikho's edition (Cheikho, 1890: iii, 385): kaJaw 'i6 'ata l-himurzu tahniifu fawqahui * ka zilli /-'uqdbi 'i6 hawat fa tadallatT. But tahnifu (allegedly:' bends') does not make sense here. In Geyer's critical edition of the dJilan of al-'A'Sa the verse appears on p. 182 (poem 40, verse 7) and has, with the Escorial MS., not tahnifu but taxniqu. Translate: 'They fought well, when al-Hamarz (the Persian commander) came, as there fluttered over him (something) like the shadow of an eagle when it swoops and then descends'; the reference is either to a banner, or perhaps rather to the angel of death. The Arabic historians say that al-HImarz (thus vocalized in Geyer) is the commander's name, but the fact that it takes the article in Arabic suggests that it is a title; cf. Manichaean Parthian h'mhyrz (h/mherz) 'attendant'. 87 See the dictionaries by Payne Smith (i, col. 1322) and Brockelmann (p. 244); the history of the Syriac word will be discussed in detail below. In the etymological section of the relevant entries in Koehler's standard dictionary of Biblical Hebrew, Syriac hanpa is rendered (not quite adequately) as 'Gottloser' in KoehlerI i, 317 (s.v. ri'), and (absurdly) as 'Bauer' in Koehler3 i, 322 (Koehler and Richardson i, 335: 'peasant '), evidently a grotesque misunderstanding of Brockelmann's 'paganus'. 88 Sokoloff, 1990: 209; Levy, Wb.

These have been compared also with Ugaritic hnp, and the verb yhnp, for which various meanings have been proposed, principally on the basis of assumed etymological connections.92 If the Ugaritic words are left out of the equation, then all the cited forms could be traced to a Semitic root h-n-p, presumably with the basic meaning 'lame' (like Arabic 'ahnaf), which in North-West Semitic would have taken on the meanings 'mor- ally lame, crooked, dishonest', and then, in Hebrew and Syriac, the specifically religious senses of 'godless' or 'pagan'. If, however, one were to insist on including the Ugaritic forms in the comparison, one would probably have to posit two different roots, h-n-p (presumably 'lame') and x-n-p (perhaps 'pol- luted' or 'dishonest'), either one (or both) of which could be the source of Aramaic and Canaanite h-n-p. As far as the formation is concerned, we must assume a primary noun *hanp- and the adjectives *.hanip- and *hanip-, all with more or less the same meaning, like the Arabic triad 'abd, 'dbid, 'abTd. In the Arabic of Christian authors, hanTf and hanafT are very widely used in exactly the same meaning as Syriac hanpa, namely 'pagan'. This meaning fits, I think, all the genuinely pre-Islamic attestations of hanif in Arabic poetry,93 and is well attested in Christian authors in Islamic times, who, for reasons discussed elsewhere, also use sabi' in the same sense. Thus, in Christian usage we have: hanif= hanafT= sabi' =' pagan' al-hanafiyyah= ' paganism' But in Muslim usage: hanTf= epithet of Abraham and of those who follow his religion = ' Muslim' al-hanTfiyyah = al-hanTfah = 'Abraham's religion '=' Islam' As distinct from: hanaff=' follower of the law school of 'Abu Hanifah' al-hanafiyyah =' the school of 'Abu Hanifah'. Christian Arabic hanajf is evidently the source for the word which in Ethiopic is spelt hianafi, lhonafi, h onofe, etc., 'pagan' (the last two written with etymologically spurious ).94 But this 'Christian' usage can occasionally be found also in Muslim authors. Thus, the historian al-Ya'qtibi, in his precis of Old Testament history, speaks of how Saul has done battle with the hunafa ', who were, he explains, 'worshippers of the stars' ('abadatu n-nujium).95 an-Nadim96 and al-Bayrtini97 both apply the name hunafa' to the polytheists 89 Drower and Macuch, 1963: 125, 136. 90 Koehler' i, 317; Koehler/Richardson i, 335-6. 91 See CAD, volume H: 79, 80. 92 See most recently del Olmo Lete and Sanmartin, 1996: 195, where hnp is glossed 'impiedad, iniquidad', and ,the verb l-n-p as 'obrar perversamente'. In the secondary literature, the Ugaritic words have been compared not only with North-West Semitic h-n-p, but also with Arabic xanif supposedly 'proud' (according to the lexica), and the Ethiopic forms with (spurious) h-, discussed below. 93 See Horovitz, 1926: 56-9, recapitulating earlier studies. 94 See Dillmann, 1865: col. 605 (with references, all to fairly late authors), and Leslau, 1987: 263. 9 al-Ya'qtbi I, 51-52. 96 Fihrist, 383. 97 'AOdr, 206, 318.</page><page sequence="20">20 FRANCOIS DE BLOIS (so-called Sabians) of Harran. Similarly, al-Mas'udi, when he speaks repeatedly in his Kitabu t-tanbThi wa l-'israf of how the Roman emperors, before adopting Christianity, had been hunafd', equated with sabi' un,98 or of how they had followed 'Sabianism, that is to say, al-hanafiyyah (variant: al-hanTfiyyah)',99 or of how the emperor Julian the Apostate (whom, in an earlier work, he calls Lulyanusu 1-ma'rtifu bi 1-hanTf F1'0) abandoned Christianity, persecuted those who did not return to al-hanafiyyah (variant: al-hanTfiyyah) and restored the sacrifices of the hunafd'.'o And in another passage he says that the Persians before the time of Zoroaster had followed the doctrine of 'the hunafd', and they are the sdbi'iin'.02 It is likely that these Muslim historians had all this information from Christian sources, but what is significant is that they them- selves did not hesitate to use the word hunafd' in its specifically Christian sense of 'pagans'. They were clearly under no illusion that the ancient Romans had been followers of the ' true religion of Abraham '. In the last-mentioned passage al-Mas'udi actually goes on to say that hanTf is a Syriac loanword in Arabic (kalimatun suryaniyyatun 'urribat), from *hanpa, 'and it is said that it is pronounced with a letter between ba' and fa' (i.e. with p), and that there is no fd' in Syriac '.l03 Naturally, al-Mas'iidi could not have believed that hanTf means 'pagan' in the Quran as well. Rather, in his usage at least, hanTf is a didd, a word with two contradictory meanings.104 We are thus very clearly confronted with the dilemma that a word which in some Arabic contexts is used to mean 'pagan', and which is manifestly cognate with words having similarly negative connotations in other Semitic languages, is, in the Quran, used to qualify the patriarch Abraham and other followers of the true religion. I do not think it at all likely that, as has sometimes been suggested, Muhammad simply misunderstood a term that was in use among Christians or Jews and consequently employed it in exactly the opposite of its correct meaning. It would seem rather that the repeated, formu- laic statement that Abraham was a hanif and 'not one of those who associate' has its basis in pre-Islamic religious vocabulary. But from whom did Islam take it? Certainly not from Jews; it is quite unthinkable these could ever have 98 TanbTh, 6, 122, 123. 99 ibid., 136. 100 Muriiju 6-rahab, II, 323. 1o0 TanbTh, 145. 102 Tanb-h, 90. 103 TanbTh, 91, where de Goeje's edition, presumably following the Paris manuscript, spells the Syriac word as hnyfw'. The London MS. has (according to my collation) hfw', which I assume to reflect a miscopying of hnf'. The statement that 'there is no " f " in Syriac' is broadly true as far as Eastern Syriac is concerned. 104 Since the present study is concerned principally with the meaning of hanif in quranic Arabic and its Semitic antecedents, I have felt justified in leaving out of consideration the decidedly vague statements in some of the Muslim sources concerning alleged hunafa' and followers of the ' religion of Abraham' among the Qurayi before and even during the time of the prophet Muhammad. The material has been collected in a prudent, and necessarily rather inconclusive, article by Rubin on 'HanTfiyya and Ka'ba' (Rubin, 1990) and was then discussed in a highly speculative, indeed fantastical, contribution by Gil (1992). I think that the historical value of these traditions is very slight; it is possible that they all derive from sources which spoke of hunafd', i.e. 'pagans', among the ancient Arabs, which the Muslim authors misunderstood to mean 'followers of the religion of Abraham'. As stated at the beginning of this section, the quranic material does not, in any case, support the notion of the hunaf~' as a discrete religious community surviving until the time of Muhammad. The question posed to us by the Quran is not: 'Who were the community known as hunafi'?' but: 'What is the meaning of the epithet han~f and why is it applied to Abraham?' For this reason I also find it difficult to accept Beeston's (1984) hypothesis linking the quranic hanif with the (apparently) non-Christian and non-Jewish monotheism of some of the late South Arabian inscriptions, specifically those invoking the god Rahmanan. There are no real reasons to think that this is the case: there is no intrinsic connection between the term hanif and the content of these inscriptions, nor is there anything to suggest that the undifferentiated monotheists in the Yemen attached any importance to Abraham, who, in the Quran, is the exemplar of the hanif. Rippin (1991) criticizes Beeston, but does not offer any positive suggestions.</page><page sequence="21">THE RELIGIOUS VOCABULARY OF CHRISTIANITY AND OF ISLAM 21 called Abraham a hanif, a 'hypocrite'."o5 I should like to suggest rather that this formula originated among Christians. But to make this hypothesis plausible it is necessary to take a closer look at the precise meaning of the Syriac word hanpd, specifically in the translations of the Bible. Our survey of the Semitic material has suggested that the basic meaning of Aramaic hanpa is 'dishonest, deceitful'. But in the Syriac versions of the New Testament it is used consistently to translate one or another of the Greek words for 'gentile, non-Jew', as a rule either the plural noun WOvir ('nations', which the Septuagint uses to render Hebrew goyfm), the corresponding adject- ive E3VLKdS, or the noun EXyrv (literally 'Hellene, Greek '). In one passage only (1 Cor 10:27) hanpe translates iTLToroL, ' unbelievers', but here this too is used in the sense 'gentiles '. As a translation of eOv-q and ~OLKO , hanp- alternates with 'amme (evidently a borrowing from Hebrew 'ammTm, 'nations, gentiles '), while as a rendering of EkpyvE~ it alternates with 'amm- and with armaye, literally 'Aramaeans'.106 It is evident that Greek-speaking Jews referred to their non-Jewish compatriots as 'Hellenes', while Aramaic-speaking Jews called the gentiles 'Aramaeans'; this usage was then continued by Christians. As is known, the Greek Christians of the Middle Ages normally called them- selves not 'Hellenes' but 'Romans' ('Pwoacot), just as Aramaic-speaking Christians called themselves not 'Aramaeans' but 'Syrians' (suryaye), a Greek form of 'Assyrians'. The fact that the Syriac Bible can designate the gentiles with a word, hanpe, which etymologically means 'deceitful ones', is clearly also a continuation of Jewish usage; the gentiles (goyfm) are by definition godless (hanjf). But in the context of the New Testament the concept of the 'gentile' is not always a negative one. Paul declared himself the 'apostle of the gentiles'. According to his teaching, Jesus promised salvation both to the Jews and to the gentiles, and to partake of this promise the gentiles do not need to become Jews, they are not subject to the law of Moses, for Christ has 'set us free' (Galatians 5:1), he has 'redeemed us from the curse of the law' (Gal. 3:13). The Syriac versions of the Bible do use hanpa to render wOv-, EOVLKO and Ekkrqv in passages where these have the negative sense of 'gentile, non- believer ',107 and tend to prefer 'amme or armaye in passages where these Greek words are used in the positive sense of 'gentile as a candidate for salvation in Christ '.o8 But this is not always the case. In the language of the translators hanpa can also be used in contexts where the concept of the 'gentile' has no negative connotations. Thus, Mark 7:26 tells of a 'gentile (literally: Greek) woman, a Syrophoenician by race' ('E2lkviS EvpoowtviKLota - 7 yyVEL)109 whose faith Jesus rewards by healing her daughter; for 'gentile woman' the PKitta has hanpai; the Vet. Syr. Sin. calls her ostensibly a 'widow' (armalta), but this is doubtless a scribal error for armdyta, 'gentile (lit. Aramaean) woman'. Acts 18:4 tells of how Paul, in Corinth, preached 'to the Jews and the gentiles' (literally: Greeks, EkkgVE); the P9iftta has 1-ThiL6aye- wa-1-hanpe, though in 105 As is claimed by Torrey, 1933: 51, 87. 106The Syriac school tradition distinguishes between dramdyd, 'Aramaean', and armaya, 'gentile, pagan', which are identical in unvocalized script. The latter is the genuine Aramaic adjective from aram. The former is a Syriac derivation from the expected Hebrew equivalent *'aram (although the Masoretic text actually uses the irregular 'dram, presumably a back- formation from a trisyllabic form like 'drdamO). For the semantic and phonetic development of these names see the fundamental article by Nildeke, 1871. o107 The P~itta uses hanpd (-pa) for ,Ovy or iOvlrs in Mt. 6:7, 10:5 (Vetus Syrus: 'ammf), 18:17, 1 Cor. 5:1, 10:20, 12:2, 1 Pet. 4:3; for E?lVEr in Joh. 7:35 (Vet. Syr.: armaye) and Act. 18:17. o108 Thus passim in the Pauline epistles. 109 In the expanded version of the same pericope in Mt. 15:21-8 she is called a 'Canaanite woman' (Mt. 15:22: yvv7 XQavavaa; the Piitta and the two MSS of the Vetus Syrus have kna'naytd).</page><page sequence="22">22 FRAN9OIS DE BLOIS other occurrences of the same phrase (e.g. Acts 19:10), EkhlvE is rendered by armaye. In Romans 1:16, Paul says that the gospel offers salvation 'to every one that believeth, to the Jew first, and also to the gentile' (or Greek, Ekhlv); here the Psitta has armaye, but the Harkleian version has hanpa. And John 12:20 speaks of 'certain gentiles' (or Greeks, Ekk~VE9) who wished to meet Jesus. The Vet. Syr. Sin. calls them armaye, the PJt.tat 'amme and the Harkleian version hanpe. It is thus clear that, despite its etymological meaning, hanpe could be used by the translators of the New Testament, without derogatory connotations, to designate also those gentiles who believe in the gospel of Jesus, in this sense interchangeably with 'amme and armaye. This contrasts with the usage in non-biblical texts, where hanpa almost always means 'non- Christian', reverting to the original negative implications of the word. This development corresponds precisely to that of Latin paganus and Old English hawfen, etc., which start out as straightforward (if doubtless inadequate) render- ings of EOLMKdO and its biblical equivalents,"io but later take on the exclusive meanings of 'non-Christian, unbeliever'. In Pauline Christianity the gentile looses his abject status and becomes a partaker in salvation, but in the catholic faith of the Christianized Roman Empire, the gentile (redefined now not as the non-Jew, but as the non-Christian) resumes his role as the outsider, the enemy. But in Paul's doctrine of the redemption of the gentiles a central role is assigned to the figure of Abraham. This is spelt out in the third and fourth chapters of the letter to the Galatians, where Paul engages in a decidedly forced exegesis of the passage in Genesis 22:18 in which Yahweh's angel declares to Abraham: 'In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed'. This promise, Paul tells us, was made to Abraham's seed, in the singular, not to his seeds, that is to say, not to the Jews as a whole, but to Christ (Gal. 3:16). The promise, moreover, was made 'four hundred and thirty years' before the law (3:17), that is to say, before the time of Moses. Only later was the law 'added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise had been made' (3:19). 'And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the nations/gentiles (ra iOv-q) by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham saying: In thee shall all the nations/gentiles (ra Ov6lv) be blessed' (3:8).111 Further: 'Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the freewoman' (4:22). This, Paul says, is an allegory. The handmaid Hagar represents 'the Jerusalem that is now: for she is in bondage with her children', that is to say the unconverted Jews are enslaved both by the ritual law of Moses and by the secular law of the Romans, 'but the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is our mother' (4:25-6). Paul pursues a similar line in the fourth chapter of the letter to the Romans: God declared Abraham righteous 'not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision' (Rom. 4:10), that is to say, the election of Abraham took place before the circumcision. 'For not through the law was the promise to Abraham or to his seed, that he should be heir to the world, but through the righteousness of faith' (4:13). 110o vor basically means 'group, swarm, tribe, nation , but already in classical Greek IOvI are also 'foreigners, provincials, barbarians' as opposed to EXhrvErs. The latter sense is rendered by Latin paganus (from pagus, 'village') as well as by Germanic forms like Gothic (fem. sing.) haifno, Old English haben (from haiti, ha b, 'heath'). The 'pagan' and the 'heathen' are thus both etymologically 'countryfolk'. Since the Gothic gospel was translated directly from the Greek, there is no good reason to assume that the Germanic usage derives from the Latin. The once widely held view that the Germanic 'heathen' words are mere transcriptions of eOvlK6 is in any case no longer tenable. "1 The English Bible reflects the ambiguity of the verse by rendering the first 8Ovy as 'heathen' and the second as 'nations'. The Pfittaf has 'amme both times.</page><page sequence="23">THE RELIGIOUS VOCABULARY OF CHRISTIANITY AND OF ISLAM 23 It is easy to imagine what impact such teachings would have had in ancient Arabia. According to the usual Jewish and Christian interpretation of the biblical genealogies, the Arabs are children of Abraham, but at the same time they are gentiles, not Jews. But Paul declared that it is precisely Abraham who is the paradigm of salvation to the gentiles: God promised this salvation to Abraham, 430 years before sending the law to Moses. In the flesh, the Arabs descend from the slavewoman Hagar, the Jews from the freewoman Sarah, but Paul says that he is not interested in physical descent, but sees Abraham's two wives as an allegory. The Jews are physically the children of the freewoman, but, unless they accept Christ, they are spiritually the children of the slave, for they are slaves of the law. The Arabs descend from the slavewoman, they are gentiles, but if they accept the gospel, they, like the believing Jews, become children of the freewoman, of 'the Jerusalem that is above', 'the Israel of God' (Gal. 6:16). We have seen that one of the Syriac words for 'gentile' is hanpd. But in the Quran hanTf is an epithet of Abraham, the one to whom God, according to Paul's interpretation, promised the redemption of the gentiles. hanif and hanpa, though they share the same root, are different forms. It is possible that hanif is an inherited Arabic word which, in a Christian or Jewish environment, took on the meaning of Aramaic hanpd, but it is also possible that the singular hanif is merely a back-formation from the plural hunafd', which, for its part, could represent a borrowing of the Aramaic plural hanpi, remodelled to fit a regular Arabic plural pattern,112 as there are other examples of loanwords that entered Arabic in the plural and whose Arabic singular is secondary.113 As it happens, Paul does not say outright that the uncircumcized Abraham was a gentile, but this is a plausible deduction from his argument, and in Syriac church literature, in at least one text, this is stated explicitly: the Syriac life of Clement of Romel14 says that Clement's parents were pagans/gentiles (hanpe), but nonetheless pious, and 'in them was fulfilled the word of the scripture', namely that 'Abraham believed in god, when he was a hanpa ' (haymen afrdhihm l-aldha xa6 hanpa wa).51' If we were to put this last phrase into Arabic, the first part would come out as 'amana 'ibrdhTmu bi lldhi, and the second part could be rendered most idiomatically as a hal clause: wa huwa hanif, or in one word: hanffan, making the whole thing sound very much like a quranic 'dyah such as 16:120, which declares Abraham to have been qanitan Ii lldhi hanTfan. This, assuming for the moment that hanif does in fact have the same meaning as hanpa, might be rendered: 'Abraham was obedient to god, as a gentile '.116 It is possible that the designation of Abraham as a hanif was inherited from Christian parlance and that the original meaning of the term was no longer understood at the time when the Quran was composed."7 But it is not necessary to assume this. hanTf can, in all of its quranic contexts, plausibly be translated as 'gentile', or perhaps more specifically as 'a person in the state of religious innocence, not bound by Jewish law', even if this is not the most 112 The latter suggestion was made already by Bell, 1953: 12. 113 See Colin, 1960-3 (discussed above in footnote 49) and also Spitaler, 1955. 114 i.e. the life of Clement contained in Lives of the Saints from Za'faran, published by Mingana in his article on 'Some early Judaeo-Christian documents' (Mingana, 1917). I hasten to add that there seems to be nothing in the text that would justify seeing it as a Jewish Christian document, or as exceptionally early. 115 Syriac text, 34 of the offprint. 116 The whole 'ayah reads: 'inna 'ibrahima kdna 'ummatan qdnitan li lihi hanTfan wa lam yaku mina l-mugrikfn, probably meaning something like 'As for Abraham, he was a tribe (unto himself), obedient to god, as a gentile, and he was not one of the associators'.

This interpretation seems particularly attract- ive in a verse like 30:30 where the hanrf is linked explicitly to man's state of primeval innocence,118 or like 3:67,119 where it is stated that 'Abraham was not a Jew and not a Nazoraean '-that is, not one of those who, like the Jews and the Nazoraean Jewish Christians, considered the strict observance of Mosaic law to be the precondition of salvation-' nor was he one of the associators', 'but he was a submissive gentile' (hanffan musliman). He was a hanif, not subject to Jewish law, but also a muslim, a person submissive to god. The proposed development of the Semitic word is illustrated in Figure 1. In conclusion, it is necessary to state that the thesis presented here is not entirely new. Margoliouth remarked as early as 1903120 that the identification of quranic hanif with Syriac hanpi 'has much in its favour' and that: by calling Abraham a heathen the author would be alluding to a favourite topic of Christian apologetics, first suggested, it would seem, by St. Paul. In Rom. iv, 10-12, it is argued that Abraham's faith was accounted upon him for righteousness before he had received the mark of Judaism, so that he might be the father of all non-Jewish believers (...). This argument would have by no means been valueless to Mohammed, though he cannnot have been accurately acquainted with it;'21 but the Christian insistence on the fact that Abraham was a Gentile would give a good reason for the name hanif being applied to him by Mohammad. This theory, however, seems to be seriously opposed by the occasional employment of the word in the Koran without the addition 'and not one of the polytheists.' And where men are told to be 'Hanifs unto God' (xxii,3)122, what sense would the word have if it meant 'heathen'? Margoliouth then proceeded to expound his own hypothesis, namely that both "8 fa 'aqim wajhaka ii d-dini hanTfan fitrata llLhi llat fatara n-ndsa 'alayha. 'And direct thy face towards the faith as a gentile, in keeping with god's (original) creation according to which he created men.' 19 Text above, note 82. 120 Margoliouth, 1903: 478-9. 121 Why not? 122 Read: 'xxii, 31 '. The phrase hunafa 'a ii Ildhi yayra muirikTna bihT means, I think, 'as god's gentiles, not as those who associate (others) to him', that is, as EOv-r in the positive (Christian) sense of 'believing gentiles', not in the negative sense of 'pagans'.</page><page sequence="25">THE RELIGIOUS VOCABULARY OF CHRISTIANITY AND OF ISLAM 25 muslim and hanif originally designated the followers of Musaylimah, the prophet (or so-called pseudo-prophet) of the Banu IHanifah, and were in effect usurped by Muhammad and his followers in the sense 'monotheist'. This is a most implausible suggestion.123 But by admitting that the 'original' meaning of hanif (' follower of the prophet of the Banti Hanifah') might be different from its acquired meaning in the Quran ('monotheist'), Margoliouth under- mined his own objection that the quranic usage does not always seem to agree with the etymological meaning 'heathen, pagan'. Then, in 1930, Ahrens considered at least the possibility'24 that the positive connotations of Arabic hanif originated 'auf Grund der christlichen Anschauung von den frommen Heiden als den von Gott erwihlten Nachfolgern der ungehorsamen Israeliten', with reference to Rom. 2:14, 11:30 sqq., and '5. Esra' 2:34 sqq.125 And at the end of the same article he expresses, this time more assuredly, the opinion"26 that 'die christliche Anschauung von Abraham als dem Vater der glaubig werdenden Heiden' (Rom. 4:11-12) was one of the sources for 'die Lehre vom Hanifentum Abrahams als einen "Heiden ", der aber kein Gotzendiener war'. Ahrens did not refer to Margoliouth's article, so it is possible that he came upon the same idea independently. I am compelled to confess that I had not read either of these articles until a time when the present study was substantially complete. It does not seem that this line of thought has been pursued by any author in the last seventy years, so perhaps it will not be considered superfluous to attempt to relaunch it from a different perspective. (3) Conclusions Similarities in religious content between Islam and 'Jewish Christianity' have been noted by a fair number of writers, in particular by specialists in the early history of the Christian church. Notable among these is no less influential a figure in that field than Harnack, more than a century ago,127 but the question has also been addressed in more recent times, especially by Schoeps,128 Roncaglial29 and Colpe.'30 It is really astonishing that this discussion has had virtually no resonance among specialists in Arabic and Islamic studies, 'Jewish Christianity' is not a phrase that one finds very often in Arabist discourse, whether from the 'traditionalist' or from the 'revisionist' stable. Of course, it is one thing to notice similarities between the teachings of two religious 123 Cogent objections against this hypothesis were raised, in the very next issue of the same journal (scholars and editors worked quickly in those days), by Lyall (1903), who remarked, among other things, that hanif cannot be a nisbah of hanTfah. "24Ahrens, 1930: 28 ('liegt es im Bereich der Mbglichkeit'). 125 i.e. the book called 'IV Esdras' in the Vulgata and 'II Esdras' in the KJV. It should be noted that the first two chapters of that book are a Christian interpolation into this originally Jewish writing. The passage cited is thus presumably theologically dependent on Pauline doctrine. 126 Ahrens, 1930: 190. 127 The very interesting excursus 'Der Islam' seems to be contained only in the fourth edition of his Lehrbuch der Dogmengeschichte (Harnack, 1909-10: ii, 529-38), and incorporates the text of a lecture which he had delivered as early as 1877. The gist of Harnack's argument is that Islam developed out of what he called 'gnostic Jewish Christianity' and inherited from this a true monotheism that is vastly superior (i.e. closer to Harnack's own rationalistic Protestantism) than the abstruse trinitarian Christianity prevalent in the Middle Ages. 128 See the chapter 'Ebionistische Elemente im Islam' in Schoeps, 1949: 334-42. Schoeps's influential book (an attempt to rehabilitate ancient Jewish Christianity as the acceptable philo- semitic antidote to the ingrained anti-semitism of mainstream Christianity) culminates in the assertion (p. 342): 'Und somit ergibt sich als Paradox wahrhaft weltgeschichtlichen Ausmales die Tatsache, daB das Judenchristentum zwar in der christlichen Kirche untergegangen ist, aber im Islam sich konserviert hat und in einigen seiner treibenden Impulse bis in unsere Tage hineinreicht.' 129 Roncaglia, 1971. 130 Colpe, 1986, discussing also (on pp. 215-17) the hanif problem, without coherent results.</page><page sequence="26">26 FRAN(OIS DE BLOIS traditions, and another to construct a plausible historical model to account for the influence of one upon the other. Harnack explicitly sidestepped this question and concentrated entirely on a typological comparison between Islam and 'Jewish Christianity' (specifically Elchasaism), especially in their respective christologies. But his successors have seen the 'Jewish Christian' input in Islam channelled primarily through the sect known in the Quran as sabi' in (Sabians),'31 whom Chwohlson had identified with the Elchasaites (but also, simultaneously, with the Mandaeans), but whom Schoeps preferred (unfortu- nately without any real arguments) to see as an Arabian offshoot of the Ebionites, the sect whose doctrines are (still according to Schoeps) enunciated in the 'Jewish Christian' parts of the pseudo-Clementine Homilies and Recognitions.'32 Roncaglia chose to sit on the fence and speak of 'Ebionite and Elchasaite elements in the Qur'an'. The equation of the quranic sabi'iin with Elchasaites (or with Mandaeans) was criticized by Tardieu in 1986 and I also argued against it in 1995 and made a new suggestion for the positive identification of the sabi'fn.'33 But even without this, the sabi'zin are mentioned in the Quran only in passing, there is no polemic against their specific teachings, and thus no reason to think that the primitive Muslim community had an intimate knowledge of their doctrines or is likely to have been influenced by them to any decisive extent. My proposal now is that the 'Jewish Christians' in the environment of primitive Islam were not those whom the Quran calls sibi' n, but those that it calls nasara, the Nazoraeans. This is the conclusion of the first part of this article. In the second part I have attempted to show that the quranic polemics precisely against the Nazoraeans make use of motives that can be traced to the Pauline epistles, specifically the notion that Abraham had been elected 'in uncircumcision' and that he is consequently the paradigm of salvation for the gentiles. The realization that the nasara of the Quran are not simply Christians, but 'Jewish Christians', who maintained, against Paul, the continued validity of the law of Moses, explains why the quranic notion of Abraham the hanif, the gentile, stands in polemical juxtaposition not only to the Jews, but also to the Nazoraeans. This suggests that the primitive Muslim community had contact with Nazoraeans. But the author of the Quran must have had some knowledge also of the teachings of Pauline (or rather pseudo-Pauline, presumably catholic) Christianity. One does not, however, gain the impression that catholic Christians were perceived as a serious rival to nascent Islam. The polemical demarcation of Islam against competing faiths repeatedly mentions Jews, Nazoraeans and 'associators', separately or together, rarely joined by Sabians and, once only, by Magians (Zoroastrians). Catholic Christians do not seem 131 In the mentioned chapter 'Der Islam' Harnack does not say anything about Sabians. Elsewhere in the book (Harnack, 1909-10: i, 331, n. 2) he does mention them as one of several possible channels of Jewish Christian influence: 'Als Religionssystem basiert der Islam z. Th. auf dem synkretistischen Judenchristenthum (einschliesslich der ihrem Ursprung nach so rithselhaften Cabier) und ist-ohne dass dabei der Originalitit Mohammed's zu nahe getreten werden soll- nur unter Beriicksichtigung desselben geschichtlich zu verstehen.' 132 The question of what differences (if any) existed between the 'Jewish Christian' sects attacked by the catholic heresiographers and of where the pseudo-Clementines fit into this sectarian quagmire are problems that remain at the heart of Jewish Christian studies. 133 de Blois, 1995, with a survey of the previous literature. The publication of the book by Gandiz (1994) coincided with that of my article and it could not be discussed there. It is, at least as far as the Sabians are concerned, only a rehash of old secondary literature (see also the review by Buckley, 1996). Bellamy, 1996: 201-3, has come to a conclusion superficially similar to mine, to which I have replied succinctly in de Blois, 1999: 65, n. 10. Alberto Fratini and Carlo Prato kindly sent me a copy of their study of the UEf3P6/Evot (' god fearers', see above n. 49) and the sdbi'in (whom they identify with one another), printed privately in 1997 but not to my knowledge published. I regret to have to say that I find their arguments very far-fetched.</page><page sequence="27">THE RELIGIOUS VOCABULARY OF CHRISTIANITY AND OF ISLAM 27 to fit into this spectrum. One could imagine a situation where there existed, presumably in Mecca, an isolated outpost of Nazoraean 'Jewish Christianity' and where Muhammad's acquaintance with Pauline teachings would have come merely from hearsay, or from his contacts with catholic (Melkite or Jacobite) Christians during his travels to Syria. But it would have been only from the former that Islam had to distance itself in its original Arabian environment. Admittedly, the traditional strah has nothing to say about these Arabian Christians, but this is a matter that needs to be pursued in another context. Naturally, I am aware that there are scholars who have doubted the idea that Islam had its beginnings in Central Arabia in the first half of the seventh century and who have proposed a later and more northerly origin. I am not alone in thinking that as yet no really convincing arguments have been offered for this temporal and spatial relocation of Islam. It is easy (and, no doubt, instructive) to criticize the available sources, but it is not easy to reconstruct history in the ensuing vacuum. But I would suggest that even those who wish to put the inception of the Muslim community somewhere other than Arabia might wish to consider the implications of the proposed interpretation of the terms nasrant and hanif and to address the question of whether the apparent preoccupation of primitive Islam with 'Jewish Christianity' and its apparent indifference to the rivalry of the great mainstream of eastern Christendom is indeed reconcilable with its relocation into such well-charted provinces of church history as Syria or Mesopotamia. My view is that Islam, in its original form, is a doctrine not at the centre, but on the periphery, of religious life in the Near East. And it is its peripheral nature, its living contact with forgotten fossils of world religions, that make the Quran a vitally important source also for the history of Christianity.
