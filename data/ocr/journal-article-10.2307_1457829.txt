<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Conception of God As Supra-Personal Yet Personal WOODBRIDGE O. JOHNSON* I. The Polarity of Theology AN'S thinking about God is bi- polar as Hume observed long ago.' It moves in two opposite direc- tions at once yet will abandon neither, for it has learned that in doing so it will lose God altogether. Webb has described this polarity as our desire for both intimacy and ultimacy in God.2 More commonly it is referred to as the tension between God's immanence and transcendence. We must have both if God is to command our worship. He must be like us and close to us if he is to be understandable and available. He must be unlike us and far above us if he is to save us from our weak- ness and transiency. It is the purpose of this paper to show that both demands are war- ranted by the nature of God and that He may be conceived as both supra-personal and per- sonal. II. Definitions But this study will have little value unless the key terms are sharply defined and distin- guished from their near cognates and deriva- tives. By the word God we shall understand "the source and sustainer of all value." By personal we mean "characterizable by terms used definitively of human persons." By im- personal we mean "indifferent to human per- sons"; that is, having no concern for their good or even interest in their existence. As such, an impersonal God would be a contra- diction in terms. By sub-personal we mean characterizable by terms used definitively of organic and inorganic beings below man in the scale of evolutionary development, or of abstractions from actual beings, or of merely possible beings. By super-personal we mean "supremely, ideally, or normatively per- sonal," a being from whom the physical, psy- chical, and moral limitations of human per- sons have been refined away. By supra-personal we mean "personal plus," a being which in its substantial form (to use the Aristotelian concept) towers im- measurably above personality yet includes it at some lower level of its structure. This was Bradley's concept when he described the Absolute as "personal and more"3 and Cal- houn's, when he wrote "God is mind and more."4 But this sense of supra-personal must be sharply distinguished from its usage as "personal in no respect," which is Wie- man's view; viz., "if God has a summit that is higher than mind and personality, he can- not be a mind and personality because these must be at the summit or not at all."5 III. Historical Evidence of Polarity Now in order to establish this polarity, we need only point out that in each of the great cultures religious thought has swung dialec- tically from the ineffable absolute to non- theistic humanism and back again. In India the extremes have been the supra-personal, attributeless Parambrahma of Shankara's Ve- dantism on the one hand and the non-theistic humanistic Sankhya pluralism on the other.6 Mediating between them is the religious and inferior personal underside of the formless absolute called "Ishvara," and such individ- * Since 1946 WOODBRIDGE O.

In China polarity is between Taoism and Confucianism. The Tao, a mystical, philo- sophical construct, is the source and sustainer of all; yet it is indescribable. It has evoked its polar opposite in the humanistic ethics of Master Kung. Between the two, we note the primordial hierarchy of anthropomorphic nature spirits, the apotheosis of Confucius, and most important, the soteriological system of Mahayana Buddhism, an import from In- dia. Greek thought appears on the stage with an opposition between the grossly anthropomor- phic nature gods and Olympian deities in the foreground and a vague supra-personal cos- mic process out of which those deities emerge, along with everything else, in the background. As the Olympians faded, the cosmic process was given two contrary interpretations: the mental or idealistic one of Pythagoras and Plato and the materialistic one of Democritus and the humanistic sophists. Aristotle's log- ical flight to the ultimate took him to an un- moved, completely actualized impersonal mover. But his need for intimacy speaks when he inconsistently gives it the personal attributes of life, thought, and goodness. As Greek thought came to a close in neo-Platon- ism it had achieved a synthesis of the polar opposites. It had constructed a metaphysical escalator by which one could descend from the rarefied air of a supra-personal, ineffable, ul- timate One to the more breathable atmos- phere of an individuated, rational and per- sonal god and thence on down to the pluralis- tic universe to be ready for the epistrophe or return trip. The history of Christendom shows a sim- ilar oscillation of theological thought. The naive Jewish anthropomorphism of Jesus and the early Christian Church moves upward into the neo-Platonic ineffability of the Father, Idealism, and the supra-personal Ab- solute of Spencer and Bradley, where God grows dim in transcendence. It also moves downward through Empiricism and finitistic theism to naturalistic humanism, where God is lost in immanence. Midway stand the more Biblical theism of Protestant Personal- ism and the doctrine of the Trinity.7 Striving for a synthesis are Thomism's analogia entis and contemporary neo-Orthodoxy's view that God is "wholly other" yet "really a person"s and that "personalism with respect to God is balanced by a transpersonal presence of the Divine."9 In each religious culture, then, the problem is the same; and the solution is the same. In spite of its claims to a special and complete divine revelation, Christianity has not been favored by God with a private key to unlock the mystery of the divine nature. The com- mon solution is simply to hold the two poles together in some sort of a synthesis, whether it be the mystic emanation principle of the Greek Plotinus, Buddhism's Trikaya, Hin- duism's transcendence-immanence double as- pect view of Shankara and the Bhagavadgita, or, in Christianity, Scholasticism's appeal to the principle of analogy and contemporary neo-Orthodoxy's contentment to rest with Tillich, in his as yet imperfectly resolved transpersonal-personal paradox. IV. Justification of Polarity Having demonstrated the general presence of this polarity as an historical phenomenon it remains to justify it on psychological, linguis- tic, and rational-empirical grounds. (1) The Psychological Ground From a purely psychological point of view it is apparent that men sustain personal atti- tudes toward God not necessarily because God is a person, but because men are neces- sarily persons. Our highest values normally come to us through personal inter-action with other human beings; hence that relationship becomes a normative pattern for our use in getting value from both the sub-human and</page><page sequence="3">258 WOODBRIDGE O. JOHNSON super-human environment. Empathy is un- avoidable. Animals and birds become pets and are treated as members of the family. St. Francis preached to fishes. George Washington Car- ver loved and talked to his experimentally- cultivated peanut vines. Seafaring men lavish affection even on ships. The fact that scien- tifically trained weather forecasters have re- cently referred to Atlantic Coast storms as "Edna" and "Margaret" is evidence of the tenacity of the pattern which in all naive cul- tures regularly personifies the forces of na- ture. So, too, in a man's dealing with the super- human or divine environment he will treat that invisible power as if it were a person. Even convinced atheists will persist in assum- ing personal attitudes toward the universe and in finding personal response therein. Having written "there is no super-human being who cares what becomes of mankind"'0 an outstanding humanist proceeds to testify only a few pages further on to having "a sense of community with the all-sustaining earth" . . and of "the revered presence of that which eludes comprehension . . . in the great cosmic setting that reaches from our feet to the infinities."" These attitudes, he writes, "do healing work on the inward man."12 Now we submit that a person who has (1) a sense of community with environ- ing reality (2) awareness of a revered pres- ence in it (3) which heals the inward man sustains a personal relationship to the uni- verse. Community and reverence are complex personal experiences which contain within them such simpler feelings as dependence, trust, humility, respect, comradeship, recipro- cal recognition and response. They are inad- missible toward an impersonal or indifferent universe. They presuppose a personal object of worship. The atheism of such men is im- plicitly theistic. So also when men who believe there is a God are yet persuaded that he is not in fact a person or personal, they may continue the fiction for pragmatic reasons. This school of thought runs from Occam, Kant, and Vaihin- ger to recent American functionalist and op- erationalist theologians. Shailer Matthews, for instance, has worked out this view sys- tematically. For him the word "person" has no semantic relevance to God, but is a useful fiction. He sees the personal relationship to God as a social pattern lifted from the human environment, extrapolated into the supra- human environment, and most effective for religious adjustment.13 For he observes that through the personal-appeal pattern God re- sponds as if he, too, were a person. But we must ask a question. If the personal metaphor works or is functionally effective in adjusting man religiously to his environ- ment, is this not confirmation of implicit ve- ridical elements present in the analogy? If a being, X, behaves consistently toward all ex- perimenting observers like a person, how can we escape the inference that he must be a per- son in at least those selected respects ? Such functionalism must be implicit empiricism. Thus what seems at first the purely subjec- tive conditioning of personal relations toward God turns out to be response to an objective personal factor in God. But of empirical as- pects later. (2) The Linguistic Ground The linguistic ground for thinking of God as personal is the principle of analogy or meta- phor, whose varieties include simile, parable, allegory, personification, myth, etc. To speak metaphorically is to speak of one thing as though it were another because of an ob- served similarity between them. At the points of similarity metaphor is a true characterizer; at all other points it is irrelevant and hence falsifying. Take the case of the mother who, watching her small son eat breakfast, calls him a pig. The metaphor "pig" is an accurate characterizer at specifiable points: both ani- mals eat greedily, sloppily, and noisily. But it is irrelevant and falsifying at other points;</page><page sequence="4">CONCEPTION OF GOD AS SUPRA-PERSONAL 259 namely, possession of four legs, a curly tail, and potential bacon. But because of the falsifying component of metaphor there is strong opposition to its use in scientific discourse, and rigorous natural- istic theists reject the personal metaphor on principle. However, metaphor is not so easily dis- posed of. In the first place it is the primordial epistemological principle of similarity mixed with difference. Aristotle said "Thought is metaphoric and proceeds by comparison, and the metaphors of language derive there- from."'4 Metaphor is the first law of learning because no strange thing is even perceptible except as it shares some common term with familiar things. When Greeks first explored African rivers they found strange animals liv- ing in them. They resembled horses yet were different because of their aquatic habitat. "Hippopotamus," the name they gave them, perfectly illustrates the nature of metaphor. Hippos, a horse, covers the similarity; pota- mus, a river, indicates the difference. Further analysis would demonstrate also that metaphor or analogy is the basic princi- ple of reasoning, whether deductive or induc- tive; and Pepper has shown15 that each great philosophical system is built upon a specific, though perhaps unrecognized, root metaphor. Metaphor is indispensable also to physical science. Witness the "migration" of ions, the "field" of force, electrical "poles" and "cur- rents," and light "waves" that "travel" and are "bent." Even mathematics and logic, which are furthest removed from figurative language, have metaphorical aspects; for they constitute quantitative and relational systems respectively which exhibit whole patterns cor- relating one to one with selected structures of reality. Finally, language itself is metaphori- cal. Metaphor "is not an extra beauty stuck into language; it is language.""' And every descriptive word is either a live metaphor or a dead one. Knowledge of God is no exception to the metaphorical principle. In fact theology is the area where man is most dependent on analogy. For of all possible objects of knowl- edge God is the most mysterious, furthest from the grasp of our sense-ridden language, and most in need of the vivifying metaphor to make him comprehensible and religiously relevant. But a common demurrer is offered here. It is insisted that there are two ways to de- scribe. In addition to description by compari- son, which is analogical, there is description by analysis, which is literal. By designating the parts, attributes, functions, and relations of deity one adequately describes him without resort to the distortions of comparison. But this solution is no escape from metaphor; it merely presupposes or postpones it. For any constituent parts, attributes, functions and relations of God must themselves first be understood by some sort of analogy. And if one refuses to describe them so, but only by analysis, one starts upon an infinite sterile regress. Since there is no escape from analogy in religion, our only problem is the matter of the choice of metaphors for God. Which will bring to light most clearly the hiddenness of his being and distort and impoverish his na- ture the least? The answer to these questions is relatively simple once one has classified available metaphors. And this is most con- veniently done by correlating them with the hierarchical gamut of the evolutionary series. There are as many basic metaphors as there are levels of known being. Reading down the evolutionary scale we find the personal, the organic, the inorganic, and the formal. The last named is Conger's designation for the abstractions of geometry-kinematics, number and logic.17 Is God better compared to a hu- man person, an animal, a vegetable, a mole- cule, a quantum of energy, or their forms and relations abstractable by the mind ? (3) The Rational-Empirical Ground-The Sub-Personal We are now ready to examine the metaphor</page><page sequence="5">260 WOODBRIDGE O. JOHNSON "personal" and its derivatives for their se- mantic accuracy with respect to God. Since we have already disposed of the phrase "im- personal God" because it is self-contradictory, we turn to the concept of the "sub-personal." Now strange as it may seem, there is an in- veterate tendency to liken the supreme being to things below man in the spectrum of being. Conventional idolatry is obvious evidence. The first step below anthropomorphism is theriomorphism and zoomorphism, then suc- cessively floramorphism, geomorphism, and astromorphism. In sophisticated cultures the sub-human metaphors are more generalized and abstract or are available only by aid of instruments of precision at the sub-micro- scopic level. If the source and sustainer of all value is "life," Bergson's elan vital, or "growth," as in Wieman's "growth of living connections of value"l8-do we not have bio- latry? If it is "matter-energy," don't we have dynamolatry as in Whitehead's "principle of concretion,"'9 and Northrop's "macroscopic atom ?"20 If God is conceived as "space- time," as in S. Alexander,21 or as "number" with the Pythagoreans, or as any other rela- tion abstracted from concrete experience, do we not have the religion of dimensionolatry, numberolatry, etc. ? If to worship anything less than the highest be idolatry, is it not equally idolatrous to conceive the highest in less than the highest available terms? It is on such grounds that sub-personal metaphors must be rejected. The Personal Is God, then, "personal"? To answer, our only recourse is analogy. Though not liter- ally or univocally a person, is not God more like a person than like anything sub-per- sonal? In answer we shall appeal to several forms of the analogical argument. The classic Roman Catholic form of the argument, ana- logia entis,22 holds that since God and man both participate in being, they are alike; hence God is like man, or personal. But of course such likeness is proportional to their respec- tive modes of being. God, possessing being in the infinite mode and man in the finite mode are inconceivably dissimilar with respect to the common term "personal" in which they are yet alike. Another variety of the analogy of being is the cause-effect analogy. Here the argument runs that every effect expresses and reveals to some degree its cause. If man, the effect, is a person, God who is man's first, final and efficient cause, must also be in some sense personal. A third form of the analogy involves the whole-part relationship. Any whole is like any sample taken from it. What- ever has come out from God (not in the pan- theistic sense) is revelatory of him. If human persons have come out of the Divine will, imagination, foreknowledge, or reservoir of possibilities, the Divine must be in some sense personal. To deny this is to violate ex nihilo. While the various forms of the rationally and metaphysically based analogia entis anal- ogy are deemed stronger than any empirical ones for Catholic thought, Protestantism finds empirical-pragmatic analogies more congen- ial. Accordingly we present the analogy of functions or comparable behavior. It goes like this. There is behavior in the universe which is neither human nor subhuman, for it ante- dates the emergence of man, produces him, and is cosmically integrative of all subhuman phenomena. This behavior is the divine fac- tor in cosmic process. Now if it can be shown that the divine behavior resembles the be- havior of human persons at specified points, we have established the veridical nature of the personal metaphor to the extent of those resemblances. What then is definitive human behavior? We propose that it is self-conscious acting, willing, feeling, thinking, in a body, in a so- ciety. Does this formula fit God ? If it does to any degree, God is a person to that degree. First then, does God act ? Yes, is the testi- mony of theism from Aristotle's "Unmoved Mover" to Wieman's "Creative Event." As the efficient cause of change in St. Thomas and its final cause in Aristotle and White-</page><page sequence="6">CONCEPTION OF GOD AS SUPRA-PERSONAL 261 head, he is the activator and agent of the cos- mic process. Second, does he will ? No, if his action is purely fortuitous, haphazard, chance, acci- dental. Yes, if it is a co6rdinated persistence of activity. To the latter behavior testify the most cautious and least anthropomorphizing of naturalistic observers. Morgan sees "a directed activity within a scheme which aims at constructive consistency."23 Santayana, the atheist, yet admits a tendency in the realm of matter "to develop a specific form and to pre- serve it."24 These descriptions contribute, if you will, a behavioristic or operational view of teleology. They are external views of what from the inside of consciousness appears as a purpose or will. Now the most important as- pect of God's willing is the value aspect. Does he will the good of men; that is, does he love them ? In answer we return to the human analogue. Operationally speaking, to love an- other is to will the meeting of his physical, so- cial, mental, ethical, and spiritual needs. Since the source and sustainer of value meets precisely these needs for mankind, he can be said, operationally speaking, to love us. Third, does God feel ? Yes. As supreme, purposeful creator of value he must be appre- ciative of it; and appreciation is feeling. He must be able to distinguish between value and disvalue and all the nuances and degrees of each. This means he is conscious, for con- sciousness is precisely awareness of distinc- tions and relations. Is he also self-conscious ? Yes, for as supreme appreciator of value, he would have to discriminate all past, present, and possible value; and in so doing would be conscious of himself as enduring experient through a temporal flow. He would also have to discriminate the perfect value, which he wills, from the less perfect value achieved in the world and other persons, and in so doing would be conscious of himself as numerically contrasted to the not-self and as a member of a society. Fourth, does God think ? Yes, if by think- ing one means the ordering of one's experi- ence and the structuring of one's environ- ment. Structure in the world of human arti- facts is prima facie evidence of human thought. Analogously cosmic structures which are not the work of humans or sub-hu- mans are the work of God and prima facie evidence of God's thought. The realization that there is a mathematico-logical structure in cosmic process is the first axiom of science from Pythagoras to Einstein. Conclusion: The universe has a mental aspect or is the ordering of a cosmic thinker. Fifth, does God have a body? Yes, if one demands not univocal use of the word "body" but only an isomorphism of functions. An amoeba has a body though no bones, brains, blood, legs, or sex organs. Let us define body as that part of the self's or experient's en- vironment which it immediately feels, knows, partially controls, depends on for its exist- ence, and which it uses instrumentally for adjustment to and enjoyment of its more re- mote environment.25 So defined, all the uni- verse save God's conscious will may be con- sidered his body, as Plato, Fechner, White- head, Hartshorne, and other panentheists have held. On their view God's more remote environment would be temporal only. Whether he could exist without his body need not be treated at this point. If he has one now, he is personal now. Sixth, is God a member of a society of per- sons? Yes, since it is the universal testimony of religion that he sustains personal rela- tions with men. Summarizing: Since in the area of divine behavior we observe analogates to human act- ing, willing, feeling, loving, thinking, posses- sion of a body, and membership in a society of other persons, we conclude that whatever else he may be, God is certainly personal. The Super-Personal The next derivative of "personal" is "super-personal," by which is meant a being who is ideally, maximally, or perfectly per- sonal; in whom all the limitations of per-</page><page sequence="7">262 WOODBRIDGE O. JOHNSON sonality are transcended, and all the powers and virtues raised to the infinite degree. Is such a designation the final and literal de- scription of God? Yes, answers classical the- ism in all cultures. There is no category higher than personality say Zoroaster, Plato, Aristotle, Ramanuja, Aquinas, Calvin, Hegel, Royce, Whitehead, Brightman, Hartshorne, and all the idealists who have ever lived. Says Brightman, "As far as we can know, the un- conscious and impersonal, if such there be in the universe, is below and not above the level of conscious personality."26 But though perfect or unconditioned per- son is our best imaginable description of God, we must show why it is not good enough and must be supplemented by the "supra-per- sonal" conception. It is not good enough because of the am- biguities and contradictions involved in it. A perfect person would be perfectly con- scious; that is, unlimitedly and eternally aware of his environment. But the ultimate God of classic theism had no environment till he created one for himself, and must thus have been primordially unconscious and sub- personal. Nor could he have been self-con- scious till then, either, for self-consciousness presupposes a society of persons on the Mead- Cooley principle that self-consciousness in man is "the taking or feeling of the attitude of the other toward yourself."27 Moreover, a perfect person would be per- fectly powerful; that is, have all the power there is. But this is pantheism or mechanism, which doesn't comport with ethical religion. And it is self-contradictory. For the exer- cise of power pre-supposes some physical op- position or metaphysical counter to its user, against which the power is exerted. But such a counter calls for an ultimacy-destroying dualism. Also, a perfect person would be infinitely loving; which means maximally related and devoted to, affected by and responsive toward all sentient creatures. What could contradict more clearly the unconditioned actus purus God of Aristotle and Aquinas ? And if God is both infinitely loving and omnipotent, the universe he created is morally incomprehen- sible, with each level of its being, by some terrible logic of nature, dependent for its sur- vival upon the perpetual destroying, devour- ing or torturing of other levels. You can not have it both ways. If God is the uncondi- tioned ultimate, he can not be literally a per- son, still less, a perfect person. And if Hart- shorne's view is sound that the absolute is no concrete reality at all, but only some abstrac- tion from it like essence, universal, or possi- bility,28 then an absolute person is a self-con- tradiction. The Supra-Personal We turn, then, to the concept of the "supra- personal" and note that we have earlier dis- tinguished two usages of the term: (1) per- sonal in no respect, and (2) personal-plus, meaning that God, whose substantial form or definitive essence towers immeasurably above personality yet is characterizable by the term at some lower level or manifestation of his being. But we have already rejected the first usage by showing that a God which was per- sonal in no respect would be unknowable or else sub-personal on account of the analogical nature of knowing. All rigorous attempts, such as Wieman's,29 to dispense with the per- sonal metaphor fail. They turn out to be re- liance upon hidden analogy, escape into sub- personal metaphors, or result in frank agnos- ticism. We must consider, then, whether there is a specifiable or meaningful content to the supra- or beyond-personality aspect of God. The question of its possibility has been clearly stated by Spencer. "Is it not just possible that there is a mode of being as much tran- scending intelligence and will as these tran- scend mechanical motion ?"30 Those who are sure it is not only possible but actual are the supra-theists of all cultures: Laotse, the Neo- Pythagoreans, Philo, The Madhyamika Bud- dhists, Plotinus, Shankara, Spinoza, Kant,</page><page sequence="8">CONCEPTION OF GOD AS SUPRA-PERSONAL 263 Spencer, Bradley, Wieman, Calhoun, and Tillich. They insist with Tillich that there is "a God above the God of theism."8' But all attempts have failed to describe him. We have nothing but analogies with which to work, and these do not reach beyond the per- sonal. Wieman sums up the problem simply. "What God may have in the way of conscious- ness, or super-consciousness, or beyond con- sciousness we do not know."82 We can not penetrate the Kantian ding an sich, the Plo- tinian ineffability, the attributeless Param- brahma. But though the "supra" lacks empirical characterization, it has a pragmatic function. It directs attention away from the finite and sensible to the object of ultimate religious concern. But, it is insisted, how do we know that there is this God beyond the personal God of theism, who is yet not another but only God's transpersonal dimension? In the first place we suspect it because of the inconceiv- ably immense empirical disparity between God and a human person. We cannot con- ceive as a person an invisible interstellar be- ing decillions of light years in diameter, who on this planet created mankind out of a single cell, and who structures, sustains, and occu- pies in eternal solitude the abysses and burn- ing gases of intergalactic space. We are also driven to believe it because of the self-contra- dictions in the perfect-person concept; again because of our intellectual tropism toward the unconditioned; finally by the reason-tran- scending flashes of what Maritain calls "our primordial philosophical intuition."33 We sense this God beyond sensation or descrip- tion as the ultimate, uncaused source and power of being, meaning, and value. And whether one names this awareness "reason," "intuition," "faith" or "revelation" our neat epistemological systems are overpowered by it and leave us wordless and worshipping. Finally, we find warrant for it in the logic of cosmic evolution. Consider a gardener tending his rosebush month by month. He cultivates, fertilizes, waters, sprays, shelters, and prunes it. He responds to its mute pleas for help when such services are lacking. If the rosebush were religious, would it not con- ceive of the gardener as its God and, lacking the requisite discriminating sense organs, would it not think of him as a super-rosebush ? And would not fish, as has been suggested, conceive of God analogously as a super-fish in a heaven paved with water? But somewhere beyond space and time, Is wetter water, slimier slime And there, they trust, there swimmeth One Who swam ere rivers were begun, Immense, of fishy form and mind, Squamous, omnipotent, and kind; And under the Almighty Fin The littlest fish may enter in." From our eminence at the top of the evolu- tionary ladder we can look down and say, "No, God is not a perfect and absolute rose- bush; he is rosebush plus. He is not an al- mighty, infinite superfish; he is fish plus." Why then should we, looking upward, con- form God to the form of the human species and limit him to an almighty, absolute per- son ? Who can prove Spinoza wrong that Ul- timate Reality has other attributes beside thought and extension ? Why should we try to crowd the abyss of the Divine Being into the tiny cup of human categories ? Is not the attempt to do so a symptom of that mental disease which Professor Douglas Steere has called "hardening of the categories"? As we know that we recapitulate our evolu- tionary past, so that while we are definitively persons we also display animal, vegetable, chemical, and electrical behavior, may we not comparably analyze the divine nature? Since all levels of cosmic being have come forth from God and reveal his nature, is not God then both chemical process and more, life and life-plus, personality and personality-plus? And if the evolutionary process continues, can we not predict that our descendants in the remote future will be as much superior to con- scious minds as we are to mechanical motions ? Can we not predict that whatever higher</page><page sequence="9">264 WOODBRIDGE O. JOHNSON species may later emerge, God will forever be like that species plus? Can we not predict that no finite species will ever exhaust or ac- curately describe the infinite source of them all? Must not God be supra-personal as well as personal ? BIBLIOGRAPHY 1cf.

(Ed) The Religion of the Hindus, New York: Ronald Press, 1953 'The Trinity is a special demonstration that God is personal and intimate. For here the human per- sonality of Jesus is absorbed into and identified with God through the incarnation. And lest this seem to imply that God was less personal and intimate before the incarnation, it is made clear that Jesus as the Christ, Son, Logos, or Second Person of the Trinity, pre-existed eternally as God. It is held also that the Trinity refutes the argu- ment that God cannot be eternally a person without membership in an eternal society of persons, for the reason that the Trinity is that society. But the case is by no means made. First, because the more realis- tically we take this society, the closer we come to polytheism, thus losing the divine ultimacy. And the only way to restore the ultimacy is to make the Fa- ther ultimate or to posit the Godhead as a separate individual beyond the Trinity. But in both these cases the Trinity is lost. Second, it is psychologically doubtful whether being a society of persons meets the requirement of being a member of a society. Unless the Godhead is a separate individual he can't be a member of the trinitarian society. If he is such a member, we have a quadrinity. But if God is a society of three equal persons, we run afoul of abnormal psychology. When a multiple personality inhabits a human body we call it a diseased personality. It has no unified integrity. Not till such a person discovers and asserts his transcendence over his constituent persons does he regain sanity and enjoy personality-producing re- lations with society. Thus a multiple-personality God, by any analogy we possess, could not be said to be a real person, only a disintegrated one. 8 Barth, Karl, The Doctrine of God, Vol. 1, Part I of Church Dogmatics.
