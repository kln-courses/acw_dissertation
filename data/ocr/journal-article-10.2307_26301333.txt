<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Law As "Father". by Leonard F. Manheim, L.L.B., Ph.D. An Aspect of the Dickens Pattern. In 1930 in The Law and the Modern Mind Jerome Frank (now a Judge of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals) undertook to apply the principles of psychoanalytic criticism to an elucidation of those processes which have led to the formulation of the Anglo-American system of common law. Pioneers like Sir Frederick Pollock, Dean Pound, Judge Car dozo, and, most especially, Justice Holmes had insisted that there is nothing sacrosanct about the principle of stare decisis and that the adherence of courts and lawyers to the principles laid down in earlier decisions was merely a semi-practical way by which lawyers might prognosticate the future de cisions of those courts, provided that the social milieu out of which those decisions had grown had not altered so as to require radical change. What was there about this prag matic concept which caused old-time lawyers and statesmen to gasp in horror? Why did the conservative teachers and practitioners of Anglo-American law affirm so mightily that their law was never "judge-made", that the function of law yer and jurist alike was to search piously in a sort of pseudo heavenly realm of established law and then to announce ritually what they had found there? For them the court might be wrong in its interpretation; the judge might have been too earth-bound to breathe the rarefied atmosphere of the world of pure legal essence. To intimate, however, that no judge had ever visited that realm, that no lawyer had ever explored it, but that both of them were merely formulating immediately useful principles to guide them in their present dilemma was — and still is — to many British and American students of jurisprudence, pure sacrilege.</page><page sequence="2">18 Leonard F. Manheim, L.L.B., Ph.D. Judge Frank thought that he had discovered the psycho analytic basis for this resistance. The average jurist, he felt, was not emotionally mature; he was still "in bondage to infantile goals". Individually and collectively, lawyers were in search of some substitute for the lost image of an omnipotent and omniscient father. Certain theologians thought that they had found such an image in a primitive, anthropomorphic concept of God; the conservative student of jurisprudence substituted for that anthropomorphic God a shadowy figure bearing the names Lex and Aequitas in stead of Yahweh and Elohim. The only American jurist who, according to Judge Frank, had completely emancipated himself from this bondage to a father-ideal was Mr. Justice Holmes. Judge Cardozo shared the same liberation to an only slighter degree. But does it not dawn upon the reader that both of these outstanding American jurists spent their entire adult life in an attempt to free themselves from the incubus of a lowering, powerful father? To one whose fa ther was the Autocrat of the Breakfast Table, to another whose father had been a shame and a plague-spot on the bench of his native state during the days of the Tweed Ring, could there be any goal more worthy of an adult than to eliminate a primitive father-fear in no matter how disguised a form it might appear? Now it must surely be apparent to any student of Dick ens that his unconscious strivings can never be said to have been fully adult. In particular, his attitude toward the various forms of the father-image was marked by that ambi valence, that mixture of filial acceptance and oedipal aggres sion which is characteristic of the workings of the Uncon scious. Mr. Edmund Wilson, then, in pointing out in "The Two Scrooges" that Dickens's reaction to father-fear and its correlative, social damnation, yielded an imaginative and intuitive sympathy with the criminal and the rebel, was reaching only a part of the truth. Charles Dickens loved law and order quite as much as he loved criminals and rebels ; he was inclined to yield, to conform, quite as readily as he was prepared to revolt. The father-image as typified in the</page><page sequence="3">The Law as "Father". 19 Law was never a consistent enemy. With the whole system of English law Dickens had no real quarrel ; that he had no concept of the underlying principles as they were later to be enunciated by men like Pollock and Holmes goes without saying. Dickens knew no more law than any bright office boy in a law office could pick up in a year's employment. When he attacked law, he did so by nibbling away at its corners. He denounced breach-of-promise trials and im prisonment for debt in Pickwick, the Poor Laws in Oliver Twist, shyster practice in Martin Chuzzlewit, Ecclesiastical Courts in David Copperfield, Chancery trials in Bleak House, labor law and divorce law in Hard Times, administrative bureaucracy in Little Dorrit. In most of the earlier novels the pattern is an incidental element in the general pattern of oedipal aggression and reprisal. To point out Dickens's unconscious motivation in his attack on Law and the elements in the Law which he chooses as the object of such attack is not, I need hardly say, in derogation of Dickens's zeal and mission as a social reform er. Such zeal may arise as the result of a process of dynamic rationalization, but that rationalization and the irrational resentment which led to it should not blind us to the social evil which is attacked nor to the social good which may be accomplished as the result of such an attack. The status of Dickens as a social prophet and reformer has been clearly set forth, by no one better than Professor Edgar Johnson, in his recent biography of Dickens. Professor Johnson has re-stated his position in a letter to the present writer in words which can best speak for themselves : For a criticism to have an extra-rational or irrational origin is not necessarily for it to remain immaturely irration al; and I think that much of his criticism not only of the law's traditional subjection to historical formulas and archaic rules of procedure but of its function as a protector of privilege rather than justice is sound on a mature level as well. . . . I think Dickens's implied extension of the criticism in Bleak House from Chancery to all — or if not all, many — vested interests, and his demonstration that in their megatherian wallowings they ultimately frustrate even the aims and the</page><page sequence="4">20 Leonard F. Manheim, L.L.B., Ph.D. welfare of those groups they were developed to favor and protect, goes deep and is in general true. Yet, having so far conceded the objective validity of the attack on institutions which have been permitted to outlive their usefulness and to perpetuate some of the very wrongs which they sought to remedy, it is still of great value to re-examine some of the subjective elements which led to that attack — and to some rather special variations in the dis guises in which those subjective elements hid themselves — in two novels of Dickens's middle period. Bleak House, it will be remembered, was written directly after the deaths of John Dickens, baby Dora, and sister Fan ny. The net result of these three deaths seems to have been a deeper veiling of oedipal aggression in that novel. The sense of guilt engendered by these deaths yielded other pro pitiatory mechanisms as well. The word guilt is used ad visedly, for let us not forget that what the Unconscious de sires and what the individual does are, to the Unconscious, one and the same thing. Hence the oedipal regressive must do penance for "killing" his father. An Oedipus, to atone for his crime, must put out the eyes that have gazed on the mother he has wed aild the father he has slain. An author has other means of propitiation and penance. He can per form the comforting miracle of restoring his father to life in the most exalted form ; he can re-create that father in the image that he (the son) loved best; he can call into exist ence a father-ideal toward whom no "son" could have the slightest objection. He can also (although this phase of the dynamic pattern is not a part of our present commentary) re create himself in the form of a daughter — whose goal it is to love the father as the son has hated him. All these things Dickens did in Bleak House. This is truly "a novel without a hero". The conventional hero figures are all banished or minimized, and instead there glows over the entire work the benign influence of that best of all fathers, John Jarndyce. Mr. Jarndyce is indeed the kind of father one would — and does — dream about. His benevolence toward the "orphaned" Esther makes even Bet</page><page sequence="5">The Law as "Father". 21 sey Trotwood's belated acceptance of her obligations to David pale into insignificance. John Jarndyce lives in Bleak House, surrounded by the children who are not his children (Esther, Ada, and Richard). As the Lord Chancellor points out, the residence has a forbidding name. But it is not a forbidding place at all, but a cozy house with many queerly shaped rooms and odd corridors, a house of which its chosen inhabitants might truly say, "In my Father's house there are many mansions". The ill-used real-life father has gone to his grave, a bleak — even black — house indeed. Yet the "bleak house" in which he now lives is, despite its forbid ding name, not a bad place at all. There is no single flaw in the character of John Jarn dyce except his involvement — against his will, of course — in the Chancery proceedings of which he is the innocent vic tim. Heaven forbid that he should take the same interest in the old case of Jarndyce against Jarndyce that drove his relative Tom to suicide, and which is destined to bring his misguided ward Richard to an early grave. There never was a kindlier, more long-suffering, gentler father than John Jarndyce; beside him even the Christ-like Daniel Peggotty fades into insignificance. "What better atonement could one make to a once-despised father? Yet it is atonement on the level of fantasy and not ad justment on the level of reality, for running alongside the apotheosis of this paragon of fathers there is a more deeply hidden aggression against the image of the Law as Father, as symbolized by the Courts of Chancery, in their turn symbol ized by the foul figure of Krook, the filthy old junk-dealer. Even in this deeply disguised revolt against authority, it is still the anthropomorphic viewpoint which best suits Dick ens, and after disguising the Father as the Law, he symbol izes the Law in a human figure. And that human figure which represents the entire legal system is not a hated lawyer like "Conversation" Kenge, insidious Mr. Vholes, or skulk ing Mr. Tulkinghorn ; not Mr. Snagsby, the hen-pecked law stationer; not even the shrewd and dominating arm of the Law, Inspector Bucket. It is Krook, literally and figurative</page><page sequence="6">22 Leonard F. Manheim, L.L.B., Ph.D. ly hidden beneath a heap of old clothes. He must perish, but it must be by the hand of no man; no, not even by an externally visible act of God. Krook must perish (as must both the wicked father and the Chancery sys tem in the dual symbolism) by and through his own foulness. There is no murder such as was used to rid us of another wicked father-figure, Lawyer Tulkinghorn, no fortuitous apoplexy, no wasting illness. No, Krook must perish through nothing short of spontaneous combustion! Sic semper patribus! Krook the evil father-law-image — and all bad fathers with him — are exploded, exorcised, and ban ished to oblivion — until they come to life again in the next novel. And they do come to life as often as they are slain. In both symbolical and concrete form we have the father-enemy again, with a much diluted father-ideal, in Little Dorrit. Even apart from the figures of William and Frederick Dor rit, in whom the old aggressive and idealizing trends are bal anced once again in a newer and more vivid form, let us note the revival of the drive against Father-Law as embodied in the denunciation of the institutions of British bureaucracy under the name of the Circumlocution Office. Here Dickens has made fuller use of the best technique of fantasy, the crea tion of a mythological figure as well as of symbolic individ uals upon which to vent his conscious indignation and his unconscious spleen. The free play which he gives to his ag gression here, coupled with the happy use of some of his best humor and satire, produces a brilliant anthropomorphic image of the institution attacked, in the family of the Barn acles. And with this novel the aggression against the law is attenuated little by little through a complex process of ad justment which results in at least partial acceptance of the figures which represent the law (as we also find an at least surface acceptance of the Established Church) in the later characters of Mr. Milvey, Eugene Wrayburn, Septimus Cris</page><page sequence="7">The Law as "Father". 23 parkle, and Mr. Grewgious. But that is another story, which we have no opportunity to investigate here. The City College of New York New York 31, N. Y. J</page></plain_text>
