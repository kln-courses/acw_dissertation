<plain_text><page sequence="1">R. Allen Harris Rhetoric of Science [Rhetoric is] the lore of the rhetor.-James Murphy [Science is] what scientists do.-Robert Proctor Before we begin, please take another look at the title; in particular, please notice that, open-ended and swollen though it is, it manages to avoid three words, one big, one mid-sized, and, in the most important side-step of all, a potent little arti- cle. The title avoids prolegomenon (the big word) and towards (the mid-sized word), because both terms are far more hesitant than we need be about rhetori- cal investigations of science. Although the field is rather new, it has proven re- markably successful, and there are abundant signs of a healthy future. As for the stout little article, the epigrams should indicate that it is missing because neither rhetoric nor science is stable enough to bear the immense burden of specificity that the definite article brings with it. Certainly there is no such thing as the rhet- oric of science. But there is, carefully denuded of specificity, rhetoric of science. In frag- mented form, it goes back as long as the two fields have existed, and it makes various appearances throughout the history of each. Aristotle, for instance, was a seminal contributor to both fields, and he occasionally speaks about them in the same breath-as when he says that dialectic and rhetoric are employed by the sciences, but are not sciences themselves (Rhetoric 1359b). Bacon's many writings on induction include a great deal of rhetorical and scientific commen- tary in concert, such as his discussion of invention in science and rhetoric (Ad- vancement, XIII). And Priestley's Course of Lectures on Oratory and Criticism contains a wide range of rhetorical advice directed explicitly at his fellow scien- tists, like Lecture IX on the analytic method. Still, the development of a specific genre of rhetorical analysis directed at scientific discourse is a quite recent phe- nomenon, only now beginning to flower. The first few steps of the new genre were rather hesitant. Rhetoric is, after all, a shabby little weasel word in most circles, and science is a god-term; put- ting the two words together, only a slim little preposition between them, was not an act for the faint of pen or keyboard. Fortunately, scholars in other fields did most of the groundwork for us. Polanyi argued that sciences are knowledge- R. Allen Harris recently completed a doctorate in rhetorical theory from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He is currently on a leave of absence from Bell-Northern Research to take up a Killam fellowship at the University of Alberta in order to work on a book analyzing the rhetoric of the "Linguistic Wars," an episode in the recent history of American linguistics.

Kuhn put the case forward that major transitions in science depend more heavily on suasion than on demonstration. Feyerabend wrote the 309-page Against Method, which contains the index entry "rhetoric, 1-309." And, finally, rhetoricians began tentatively to discuss the merits of stepping through the door these men had opened. A little later, some actually stepped through, and since the early part of this decade, a cottage industry has begun to grow up around the splicing of the weasel word and the god-term (a few outliers to this pattern, however, stepped through the door without theoretical dispensa- tion or philosophical warrants, doing some very fine work in the bargain-most notably, Weaver and J. A. Campbell). The cottage industry, though, is something of a jumble. At one end of the spectrum there are investigations of scientific debates, such as Lyne and Howe's look at the punctuated equilibrium controversy. At the other end of the spec- trum are close readings of rhetorical masterpieces in the history of science, such as Alan Gross' work on Newton's Opticks and Michael Halloran's look at Wat- son and Crick's "A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid." At the other end are justifications for the field, like Paul Schollmeier's suggestive blend of Mill and Aristotle, and Herbert Simons' dialogue "Are Scientists Rhetors in Dis- guise?" At the other end are Thomas Lessl's explorations of religious elements in scientific discourse. I could go on, but the moral of this exercise should be an- noyingly clear by now: rhetoric of science has a lot of ends, most of them loose. The principal difficulty is that both rhetoric and science have plenty of loose ends on their own. Science is especially notorious in this regard. It is extremely difficult to circumscribe either the theory or the practice of science; or, more ac- curately, it is extremely difficult to find circumscriptions for it that have wide- spread assent. And it is equally difficult to find a roomful of rhetoricians who will agree to a succinct definition of their field, or even to agree that such a defi- nition is possible, or useful, or desirable. Bringing the two enterprises together, then, is guaranteed to run afoul of the semantic police in both fields. But Plato has a caution for us here: "to use words in an easy going way without scrutiniz- ing them too curiously is not, in general, a mark of ill breeding; on the contrary, there is something low bred in being too precise" (Theaitetos 184c). Take the fa- mous case of Kuhn's paradigm. It is a wonderfully expressive and useful term, but when it is scrutinized too curiously (say, by Masterman) it unravels, and Kuhn has partially repudiated it under repeated assault by ill-bred philosophers lusting after precision while ignoring substance. Paradigm, however, has sur- vived very well, thank you, has gone on to thrive, wherever it is used in an easy- going way. (Very few pieces of natural language-perhaps only pronouns, arti- cles, and a few other functors-could withstand this kind of intense semantic probing. Count how many ways you use over or top or program.) If we heed Plato's advice, then, and stay at a productive level of vagueness- or, to use the honorific customary on such occasions, stay at a productive level of abstraction-we can find a coherent center for rhetoric, for science, and for their prepositional alignment.</page><page sequence="3">284 College English Rhetoric, as many of the ancient sophists held, comes principally through os- mosis. Rhetors learn their craft through practice, study, and imitation-through apprenticeship to an established rhetor. The mature Cicero shared this view, as did Quintilian: rhetoric is a culture, a perspective, a Weltanschauung. It is, em- phatically, not a collection of schemes and tropes taught by catechism, as "one would teach the letters of the alphabet" (Isocrates, Against the Sophists ?10). It is, in Murphy's phrase, "the lore of the rhetor" (4). Science, as many modern philosophers of science hold, comes principally through osmosis. Scientists learn their craft through practice, study, and imita- tion-through apprenticeship to an established scientist. Polanyi holds this view, as does Kuhn: science is a culture, a perspective, a Weltanschauung. It is, em- phatically, not a collection of procedures and techniques to be taught by cate- chism, as one would teach the axioms of Euclid. It consists, in Feyerabend's terms, of "a somewhat chaotic list of rules of thumb" ("Problems" 278). More in the spirit of Murphy's useful tautology, Proctor calls it "what scientists do" (9). What scientists do is interpret the empirical domain. What rhetors do is influ- ence one another. What scientists do as rhetors is influence one another about interpretations of the empirical domain. In two easygoing definitions: science is the study of natural phenomena; rhetoric is the study of suasion. Both defini- tions will surely find opponents, but both are sufficiently general and sufficiently representative that we can proceed with a minimum of controversy: rhetoric of science is the study of suasion in the interpretation of nature. The principal goal of this paper is to explore this last definition in three ways. First, in concert with some other similarly easygoing definitions, it places rhet- oric of science in context with its higher profile and more established neighbors: sociology, psychology, history, and philosophy of science. Second, by glancing at the gross features of the lore of the scientist and the lore of the rhetor, it gen- erates a useful typology of concerns for rhetoric of science. Third, seen through the terministic screen of prototype theory, it characterizes the central issues of the field. All this classifying is, admittedly, a little like giving the chicken leave to cross the road after it has already made the trip and is busy finding out what's on the other side. Rhetoricians have done a fair amount of scratching around in science already, getting along just fine without broad taxonomic dispensations, thank you very much. But, (1) there would be very little to classify if there hadn't al- ready been some scratching; (2) investigations need to build on one another, and it is always easier to build on a network of related studies than on a pile of loose ends; which (3) makes this precisely the right time to outline the field in broad strokes. A fine recent paper by Alan Gross ("Discourse") takes one approach to marking this outline-an impressionist's approach, softening lines and blending colors so that sociology of science smears into rhetoric of science which smears into philosophy of science; his central concern, rhetoric of science, is a catholic assortment of interests. My approach is the converse-cubist, if you like-hard- ening edges and sharpening angles, an approach which sets up rigid, and perhaps brittle, distinctions among the various disciplines preposing themselves to sci-</page><page sequence="4">Rhetoric of Science 285 ence, and among the various interests manifesting under rhetoric of science. That is, to put aside the oil-based metaphors, my approach is fundamentally tax- onomic. (There are only a few scattered discussions in the rhetoric of science liter- ature that broach taxonomic issues. Cook and Seamon distinguish "between the internal and external rhetoric of science." The former "deals with attempts by scientists to communicate with, convince, and persuade one another." The lat- ter, "of course, is the complement," the study of "attempts at persuasion, con- vincing, or communication between those who are scientists or members of the broader scientific community on the one hand and those who are not scientists or members of the broader scientific community on the other" (146). They use this distinction principally as a stick with which to beat Feyerabend, whose work, they say, is directed toward the external rhetoric of science, the weaker sister of their dyad. They are way off the mark on this with respect to Feyera- bend, but the observation is generally a useful one. The difficulty is that it is far too coarse-grained. By focussing on the audience of the discourse, and not the discourse itself, or the possible range of rhetorical perspectives, Cook and Seamon collapse a great deal of variation. Recall, however, that their primary concern is with Feyerabend, not with a classificational scheme for rhetoric of science. Gross also offers a very informal classification, again binary, of "rhe- torical masterpieces in science," those that incite revolution, and those "ingen- ious enough to avoid it" ("Shoulders" 1). The distinction is a nice one-since it plays on the two most important suasive reflexes in science, assent and dis- sent-but Gross would likely be the first to acknowledge that it is not a serious attempt at taxonomy. And his "Discourse on Method" catalogs a number of neo-Aristotelian vantages on science; again, however, his interests are far from classificational, and he would surely disavow any serious taxonomic goals for the discussions.) Neighbors As the new kid on the block, rhetoric of science must be placed in context with the more established studies of science. If it has no distinct relation to science, it is, quite simply, unwarranted. For reasons which will become clear shortly, the most convenient place to start is with its relation to sociology and psychology of science. All three of these fields are extremely amorphous. There is a great deal of scatter and over- lap among their various concerns and methods, as well as among other nearby concerns, like those of philosophy and history. Sociologists and psychologists look at discourse, often seeking many of the same patterns as rhetoricians. Rhet- oricians look at community, and they look at cognition. There is also a fair amount of cross-pollination among these fields, producing hybrids like Bitzer's sociological rhetoric and Greggs' recent attempts to ground rhetoric in neu- rology, and, for that matter, the entire field of social psychology. But, as severe as the problem of enforcing these borders is in practice, it is relatively straight- forward in principle. Chemistry, for instance, interpenetrates physics at the</page><page sequence="5">286 College English atomic level, biology at the molecular level, and a wide range of other sciences (like geology and paleontology) in more peripheral ways. Still, if we remain at a general level, there are relatively clear meanings for chemistry, physics, and the various-ologies, and, as de Saussure argued, where there are meanings, there are distinctions, boundaries. One of the ways we know physics is that it is not chemistry, nor biology, nor rhetoric. That is, we know by differences. Another way we know is by forming prototypes and gauging all other objects and events against those prototypes. The prototypical activity in physics, for in- stance, is dropping a pair of unequal cannon balls from the tower of Pisa, mea- suring their descent, and weaving theories out of those measurements. Smashing neutrinos into one another or positing one dimensional curves to account for subatomic behaviors fits reasonably well against that prototype; mating fruit flies or wrenching hydrogen out of water fits less well. We know by similarities. As in most things scholarly, the similarities and differences among these three disciplines resolve into straightforward, common-sense definitions: psychology deals with cognitive processes and subconscious motivations; sociology deals with social clusters; and rhetoric deals with suasion. Notice that these divisions do not affect subject matter so much as approach. Scientists are people. There- fore, they experience mental states. They gather into groups. And they exchange symbols (which wouldn't be symbols if they didn't influence, didn't sway, the people involved in the exchange). The key, then, is clearly that the three disci- plines are distinct because of the approaches they take, because of the lenses through which they look at science, far more than because of the particular areas or episodes they choose to focus on. Take the Max Planck Effect, the phenomenon whereby the clash between competing paradigms-one emerging, one established-divides rather neatly along generational lines. Clearly, this phenomenon is sociological, since it plays two groups off against one another. But it also has psychological features. As most commentators have noticed, there is an Oedipal component to such schisms, one with a peculiarly masculine and historical reflex. Scientific revolu- tionaries kill off their fathers as summarily as possible and resurrect their grand- fathers (unfortunately, there have been few mothers in science). And, of course, the sociological and psychological features have discursive manifestations. They may take the form of class-based arguments, as in the Copernicans' appeals to the rising mercantile classes (Jacob 10-42), or in the rallying cries of graduate students and junior professors around a new research program which they op- pose to the "old religion" of the established figures in a discipline (Muller 137, 152). These discursive manifestations are the specific concern of rhetoricians, particularly as they align themselves into suasive patterns. In short, each discipline looks at the same phenomenon in its characteristic way-sociology looks at it for any and all implications concerning social interac- tion, psychology for any and all implications concerning mental states, rhetoric for any and all implications concerning symbolic interaction. For purely theoretical reasons, then-parallel to the abstract distinctions that physicists enforce between weight and mass, in a way calculated to make en-</page><page sequence="6">Rhetoric of Science 287 gineers hurl themselves from their bridges-these distinctions distill into the fol- lowing definitions: SOCIOLOGY OF SCIENCE the study of scientific communities-at levels ranging from small cohorts to overall communities-and of their relation to general sociological pressures. PSYCHOLOGY OF SCIENCE the study of the thought processes which lead to the gen- eration and promulgation of scientific ideas, and their re- lation to general psychological mechanisms. RHETORIC OF SCIENCE the study of the role of discourse in science, particularly in its more clearly suasive functions-galvanizing, re- solving, or avoiding disputation. There are, of course, two other prepositional disciplines conspicuously absent from this list, the history of science and the philosophy of science, both of which require some attention before we can turn our taxonomic interests more directly on discourse and disputation in science. There is no mystery about the absence of the first one. It's just that the key notion of the classification perspective isn't especially suited to historians. They are best understood in terms of subject matter, not analytic approach. The sub- ject matter, naturally, is history: things that happened in the not-terribly-recent past. History of science, then, looks at scientific things that happened in the not- terribly-recent past. For instance, a historian of science would look at an in- stance of the Max Planck Effect in Victorian England's acceptance of Dar- winism, or perhaps even in the resistance to plate tectonics in the geology of the 1960s, but not at Sheldon Glashow taunting the superstring theorists, or at Mitchell Feigenbaum's inability to impress established physicists while laying the foundation of chaos theory for graduate students and junior professors to build upon-at least not for awhile. History is also more concerned with larger durations than other humanist disciplines, and it might be concerned with how the Max Planck Effect iterates through the centuries. The other gap in the list, though, is not so easily papered over-principally because the perspective that characterizes philosophy (best captured by the term mulling) is so omnivorous that it doesn't easily abide common-sense definitions. There is also the complicating factor that philosophy has the political upper hand in most dealings with rhetoric, having strongly benefitted from two evolutionary principles. The first of these principles, which has served philosophy very well in a number of areas, is survival-of-the-first. When a competitor for a resource arrives earliest, it rapidly fills the ecological, or intellectual, niche and has priority over the worm. Later competitors have to struggle much harder to dis- lodge it from its niche than it originally did to establish itself. Buck characterizes the rhetorical equivalent of this principle in explicitly martial terms: "As in much primitive warfare the stronger of the two tribal organizations subdues and eventually enslaves the weaker, so in discourse the initial advantage of the speaker returns to him with usury" (85). The second principle, which has served philosophy even better, is survival-of-the-avaricious (known as capitalism in ec- onomics). A greedy species, one that consumes more of the available resources</page><page sequence="7">288 College English than it requires for life, ensures its ecological dominance by robbing its com- petitors. Philosophy is extremely good at co-opting resources for itself. For in- stance, Mach, Duhem, Ostwald, and the other "instrumentalists" were all scien- tists writing about science, whom the philosophers have adopted as their own. Kuhn is largely a historian of science, Holton calls his work folklorist, Feyera- bend calls his work almost everything but philosophy, and all of them started out either indifferent or hostile to philosophy of science, which promptly swallowed their work whole-in part out of sheer appetite, in part because it had an estab- lished body of discourse in place that covered the same or similar issues. (This pattern is true more broadly, of course. Aristotle was a biologist, physicist, po- litical scientist, rhetorician, literary critic, and philosopher, who is now regarded uniformly as a philosopher who also dabbled in some other fields on the side. Augustine and Aquinas were theologians. Descartes was primarily a mathemati- cian, a psychologist, and a physicist. The list is vast.) To steer this discussion away from diatribe, I need to acknowledge that rhet- oric is every bit as insatiable as philosophy, and the two of them have been eat- ing each other's young for at least two millennia-sociology and psychology, which only left their nests in this century, being among the most prominent youngsters. The primary difference between them is that philosophy has been by far the more successful, particularly since the Renaissance, because it staked nearly exclusive rights to the Truth, leaving only the handmaid's role for rhetoric. None of this brings us any closer to even an artificial boundary between rhet- oric of science and philosophy of science. There is, for instance, no clear way of characterizing how a philosopher of science would tackle the Max Planck Ef- fect-and especially no clear way of distinguishing between that treatment and those of sociologists, psychologists, rhetoricians, and historians. Since the tax- onomy is starting to break down, my temptation is to dismiss philosophy of sci- ence as a chimera, what a philosopher might call a triumph of rhetoric-all win- dow dressing, no window. What the breakdown really shows, though, is the arbitrariness of the taxonomy. There are some entities, like platypi, which are not fully mammals and not fully reptiles, and classifying them by those catego- ries only establishes the artificiality of the classes. Philosophy is just such a beast, and philosophy of science shares many of the characteristics of sociology and psychology of science, not to mention the reptilian rhetoric of science. All of this has to do with philosophy's self-appointed role to sit "as a tribunal of pure reason, upholding or denying the claims of the rest of culture" (Rorty 4), a role in many ways parallel to the self-appointed role of rhetoric, which sits as an advisory board, telling the rest of culture which suasions best uphold or deny its claims. Philosophers claim to think about everything; rhetoricians claim to talk about everything. But, of course, philosophers are wont to talk about what they think, and rhetoricians have been known to think about what they say. Even more problematically, philosophers regularly tell people how to talk, and rhetori- cians tell them how to think. We can wriggle at least part way off this hook by noting that the competition and the overlap between rhetoric and philosophy revolve around the notion of</page><page sequence="8">Rhetoric of Science 289 truth. They have both traditionally been concerned with the acquisition and de- ployment of truth, but each has focussed on a different type of truth. Philosophy is concerned with certain truth, the type of truth that has worn the capital T since Plato. Rhetoric is concerned with contingent, circumstantial, probable truth, the type of truth that has always seemed a very distant second in the epis- temic sweepstakes. But certain truth has lost a good deal of its luster, its claim to upper case status, in the twentieth century-largely due to the immense suc- cess of sciences like quantum mechanics and molecular biology, for whom cer- tainty is at the other end of an asymptote. Consequently, most philosophy of sci- ence in the latter half of this century has been concerned with the decay of certainty, with how scientists traffic in meanings and theories, and even data, that are "only" true contingently, circumstantially, probably. And, as above, this is where the rhetoricians come in. When the philosophers backed away from certainty, they began to approach the classical concerns of rhetoric. Rorty, for instance, says this recognition puts philosophy back where the sophists were before Plato (157). More characteristic of rhetoric than concerns with truth, however, are con- cerns with suasion: the capacity to weave discourse into fabrics that others per- ceive as true. Here, we can finally draw some sort of boundary, since philoso- phy still tends to look down its nose at suasion. Philosophers still hear Kant muttering in their ears that rhetoric "[because it is] the art of employing people's weaknesses for one's own purpose deserves no respect at all" (Critique of Judgement ?53nl). Even a bad boy like Feyerabend often feels compelled to use the derogatory propaganda for suasive practices. Notice that it isn't necessary to draw Cicero's boundary here-to say that philosophy is concerned with the acquisition of truth, rhetoric with its deployment-just to recognize that rhetoric has more interest in the uses of truth than philosophy does. This demarcation is the fuzziest of a fuzzy lot, true. As many thinkers have noticed, in matters of truth acquisition and deployment are frequently indistinguishable. But the differ- ence in perspective again gives us a peg on which to hang a distinction, so long as we don't force it to bear too much weight. Philosophy of science, according to this distinction, pays more attention to such specific notions as empirical va- lidity, falsifiability, and the range of data covered by a given concept. Rhetoric of science pays more attention to the way empirical validity and falsifiability and conceptual scope are put to discursive work, the way they play themselves out in the arguments scientists construct to sway one another and the public. That is, philosophers are concerned with the validity of the ontological claims of sci- ence (which is why philosophers of science cluster into positions with labels like realism, anti-realism, and constructive empiricism). Rhetoricians usually, though certainly not always (e.g., Cherwitz and Hikins), follow the sophists and remain agnostic about ontology while focusing more exclusively on the argu- ments scientists offer for their ontological claims. With all the above provisos in mind, then, we can add the following two defi- nitions to our general catalog: HISTORY OF SCIENCE the study of science in the not-terribly-recent past. PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE the study of the ontological validity of science.</page><page sequence="9">290 College English Before we can move on to a closer look at the rhetoric of science, however, we need to be very clear on two points. First, it bears repeating yet again that these are deliberately general definitions of the sort that Plato (sometimes) rec- ommends. In particular, they aim only for the very center of these fields. I will offer a brief explication later of prototype theory that should make this willful disregard of fruitful peripheries more understandable, if not entirely forgivable. But, for the moment, let me stress that this general taxonomy is not meant to deny that there are concerns which run through all of these fields (principally epistemic concerns), nor to discount the very interesting work that results from blending these approaches. For instance, there are some branches of sociology of science which cover expressly rhetorical ground (such as Latour and Wool- gar; Knorr-Cetina; and Lynch; see Bazerman, "Social Act"; and Myers, "Writ- ing Research," for concise discussions), and some historians of science have begun using continental notions of rhetoric in their work (such as Cantor; Golin- ski; and Yeo; see Christie for a brief introduction to this literature). There are also various blends of psychology and sociology with the history of science, and philosophers of science often make very good use of work in cognate humanist approaches (which, in turn, borrow liberally from philosophy). All of these de- velopments are welcome, some are quite exciting, but for our purposes they are clearly hybrids-like molecular biology, which is not central to chemistry nor bi- ology, or speculative physics, which contains as much philosophy and mathe- matics as physics, and is not central to any of them. Please notice that, as my use of two revered fields in these analogies should signal, central here is not an evaluative term. Second, another point related to valuation: these distinctions are, emphat- ically, not pejorative. There are, I am sure, readers who see these general defini- tions as an attempt to dismiss sociological approaches to science, or philosoph- ical approaches. Some readers may even see the centrality of suasion to my definition of rhetoric as a (perhaps unwitting) denigration of the field. Nothing could be further from my intention. Science is a very complex activity which will not be fully revealed by a single approach. (And suasion is a much more powerful concept than many scholars seem to be aware.) There is ample room for several modes of study, including some which are only a glint in a few schol- ars' eyes-literary criticism of science, perhaps, and anthropology of science, possibly even biology of science. There are, in fact, a few examples of the first category, literary criticism of science-Beer and Hernadi, for instance-though literary criticism is traditionally defined more by its object of study than by its approach, and many literary scholars are very reluctant to extend their priv- ileged use of literature to include scientific texts. (Notice that literary criticism of science applies critical tools to scientific texts, which is a very separate, and much more thoroughly explored, pursuit from examining the impact of science or science writing on literary works-see, for instance, Jones; and Rabkin). Feyerabend sometimes calls his work anthropology of science, but the label is more a device to tweak philosophers of science than an accurate description of his approach. Still, some sociologists (such as Lynch), and some rhetoricians (such as Bazerman; and Myers), have used ethnographic methods to good effect,</page><page sequence="10">Rhetoric of Science 291 which bodes well for a full blown anthropology of science (see also Rosaldo). As for biology of science, I don't know of any work in the area beyond some vague explorations of notions like natural selection in the study of theory development, but van Fraassen is surely right when he points out that "science is a biological phenomenon, an activity by one kind of organism which facilitates its interaction with the environment" (39), and Hull weaves a great deal of evolutionary as- tuteness into his philosophy of science. Rhetorics of Science Rhetoric and science, despite carrying largely opposite evaluative connotations, have this in common: they are both big, sloppy words. This scope and looseness is a complicating factor, and it would be absurdly optimistic to expect a tidy do- main to result from applying the lore of the rhetor to the lore of the scientist. But it would be equally absurd not to expect some order at the general level, and a close look at rhetorical analyses of science reveals patterns inherent to each of the big, sloppy words on either side of the preposition. It reveals some rhetorical chickens scratching at the traditional interests of rhetoric-composition, lan- guage studies, and public policy. It reveals some of them pecking at the seams of science where it merges with the two other big, sloppy words that have dogged science throughout its history, religion and technology. And it reveals most of them clucking about the prototypical interests of both fields, argumentation and knowledge. In short: some rhetoricians of science tend to focus on the more overt manifestations of suasion; others tend to focus on the explanations for, and the domination of, natural phenomena; most focus on the suasive elements that comprise the arguments about natural phenomena that generate knowledge. The most sensible taxonomy, then, is one based on the confluence of all these interests-invoking categories like the rhetoric of public science policy and the rhetoric of technology, and assigning a default value to the central, overarching category, rhetoric of science. As with all taxonomies, of course, these categories are arbitrary. This is not a bad thing. There are very few or perhaps no examples of knowledge which are not arbitrary in much the same way. The meaning of arbitrary, for instance, is arbitrary; we would not be able to traffic in such things as knowledge and truth at all had we not somehow, somewhere, negotiated certain vocal squawks and chicken scratches into standing in relation to other squawks and scratches and relations, in such a way that the network of all bestows significance on each- had we not arbitrated language into existence. A quick and dirty survey of the concerns within rhetoric of science needs to rely on the components which constitute the big, sloppy words on either side of the preposition. For that matter, a slow and hygienic survey of those concerns probably also has the same needs. The difference is that the quick and dirty sur- veyor of uncertain territories can begin where the slow, hygienic one frequently ends up, as William James does when he tackles another big, sloppy word (which we will see again), religion: "do what we will with our defining, the truth must at last be confronted that we are dealing with a field of experience where</page><page sequence="11">292 College English there is not a single conception that can be sharply drawn" (227). As we have seen above (and, of course, as James regularly and brilliantly illustrates), there is no reason for this observation to lead to the semantic nihilism of deconstruc- tionism, so long as we are willing to tolerate fuzziness at the boundaries. Starting with the easiest of a very difficult twosome, it is exceptionally diffi- cult to draw boundaries sharply between science and, on the one frontier, re- ligion, and on the other, technology. But this overlap is not problematic for rhet- oric. Indeed, exploring the genetic drift of the family resemblances of these three terms makes for extremely rewarding rhetorical research. The various suasive blends of science and religion are particularly rich. Most such mixtures fall on a continuum running between the religious appeal to science and the scientific ap- peal to religion. Close to one end are groups like Transcendental Meditation and Scientology, religions which organize much of their salesmanship around the ca- pacity to ape certain features and interests of science. Close to the other end are the biblical arguments of Immanuel Velikovsky and the Taoist arguments of "new physicists" like Fritjof Capra and Gary Zukav. Somewhere between are the creationists and the Gaianites (at least in their earlier rhetorical garb-see Kerr for a discussion of recent recantations). More subtle, and more fascinating, are the topoi which early scientists like Kepler, Galileo, and Newton borrowed from Christianity, and which still suffuse scientific argumentation, topoi like simplicity, harmony, and determinism. Occasionally they show up in explicitly religious formulations-as in Einstein's famous deterministic aphorism, "God does not play dice with the universe"'-but their religious origins are usually hid- den even to the scientists who regularly appeal to them. Despite its richness, rhetoricians have not yet mined this territory very deep- ly. There is some good historical work. For instance James Stephens ("Style as Therapy," especially 196-98) looks at Galileo and Kepler's appeal to Christian doctrine, and J. A. Campbell ("Darwin and The Origin" and "The Polemical") explores Darwin's exploitation of natural theology in Origin. Thomas M. Lessl has also done some interesting work on more recent manifestations of religion in science; specifically, a study of Carl Sagan's use of religious imagery in Cosmos ("Science and the Sacred Cosmos"), and an investigation of the parallels be- tween the treatment of dissent in science and the treatment of dissent in Chris- tianity ("Heresy"). But, for the most part, this area has received very spotty rhetorical attention. The astute reader is perhaps again aware of an omission-in fact, a taxonomic sin. We have a category without a name. This situation is not easy to resolve with elegance, because the continuum runs from predominantly religious dis- course, which borrows its appeals from science, to predominantly scientific dis- course, which borrows its appeals from religion. That is, it runs from scientific rhetoric in religion to religious rhetoric in science, and only the latter is of ex- press taxonomic concern to this paper. Bringing back our favorite preposition, then, we can use the clumsy but appropriate label, the rhetoric of religion in science. Equally interesting and equally neglected, but much more satisfactorily labeled, is the rhetoric of technology. This area is phenomenally ripe-from the</page><page sequence="12">Rhetoric of Science 293 amount of justification required to grant the argument that microscopes enlarge tiny objects (Hacking 186-209); to the richly sophistic ethos that informed Los Alamos under Oppenheimer (Davis 179-87, where the spirit is defined as "har- monious anarchy"); to the rhetorical dependence of chaos theory on the tech- nology of digital and analog computers (Gleick 226-40); to the severe epistemic liability of string theory, which cannot successfully link its arguments to tech- nology (Davies and Brown 140-50). So far, however, there has been very little interesting work in the rhetoric of technology. A notable exception is Farrell and Goodnight, who investigate the rhetorical mishaps which surrounded the tech- nological mishaps of Three Mile Island. Rhetoric, more slippery even than science, has at least three relevant borders, none of which lends itself to sharp delineation: it shades into composition stud- ies (for some communities, rhetoric and composition are virtual synonyms); it shades into language studies; and it shades into public debate. There is one important difference, however, between the exploration of argument fields that science shares with religion or technology, and the exploration of science in light of work in composition studies, in language studies, or in public debate: rhetori- cians feel much more comfortable in the latter areas, so there has been a good deal more research in them. Richard Weaver, for instance, wrote a nice paper on the writing habits of social scientists (good, bad, and ugly) over thirty-five years ago (186-210), and Charles Bazerman has turned scientific composition virtually into a personal industry. In the rhetoric of scientific language, there have been several very fine semantic analyses (Anderson; Carlisle; and Paradis). And the study of public debate over science policy has also seen a number of good inves- tigations-including another paper by Weaver, this one on the forensic rhetoric of the Scopes trial (27-54), and Alan Gross's and Craig Waddell's studies of the recombinant DNA controversy of the 1970s. This is not to say that rhetoricians have exhausted the subject matter in these areas. We have barely scratched the surface. In composition studies, for in- stance, we might work to incorporate the findings of communication theorists that correlate readability (or, rather, the lack of it) with authority (see Hartley and others' reviews of these studies), or we might look at the importance of my- thos in science (such as the "accidental discovery" stories associated with peo- ple like Fleming, R6ntgen, and Bell Burnell). In language studies, the suasive impact of names like black hole and deep structure is ripe for investigation, as is the influence of metaphors. And public science policy is an immensely fertile area; one of the most obvious areas to start this expansion is with the close in- terweaving of specific topoi in science and government. The economic and impe- rial themes of Victorian geology is a case in point, as is the prestige of nuclear physics in cold war America, and the wax of biology and medicine in Nazi Ger- many, which needed warrants for its vicious social programs. Rhetoric of Science Sagacious readers, especially those familiar with the rhetoric of science liter- ature, might again start clucking their tongues at the taxonomy here-which now</page><page sequence="13">294 College English includes the rhetoric of religion in science, the rhetoric of technology, the rhet- oric of scientific composition, the rhetoric of scientific language, and the rhetoric of public science policy. And the clucking has reason. How does one, for in- stance, determine whether Waddell's work on the recombinant DNA debates be- longs in the public policy pigeon hole or in the technology pigeon hole? How does one justify the slot assigned to Weaver's study of the Scopes trial-against, say, slotting it in the religious category or in a category by itself, the forensic rhetoric of science? More problematically, does Anderson's study of the lan- guage of chemistry in eighteenth-century France (Between) belong to the rhet- oric of science or to the literary criticism of science (as, for instance, Hannaway apparently regards it)? The answers to these questions, fortunately, are largely irrelevant. We have, again like our duck-billed friends, bumped into the limits of taxonomy. But these limits are not debilitating. The important point here is not the integrity of a set of rigid cubby holes, but the concert of patterns and leitmotifs-some of them in- choate, some quite well formed-which play at the intersection of rhetoric and science. They play in and around one essential prototype which combines the primary features of our big, sloppy words, rhetoric and science. More to the point, they approach or depart from rhetoric of science to the extent that they approach or depart from that prototype, scientists arguing about science. Eleanor Rosch and a number of collaborators have developed a theory of cog- nition which has come to be known as prototype theory (see, for instance, the papers in Rosch and Lloyd). Prototype theory recognizes the primacy of catego- rization for mental processes and the centrality of prototypes in the definition of categories. Briefly, the category "bird" has many members, which standard bio- logical taxonomies distinguish among. But such taxonomies do not distinguish among those members in terms of "birdiness." In a wide range of experiments, prototype theorists have demonstrated what is clear to all of us with a moment's reflection, that people regard some birds (like robins and sparrows) as more cen- tral to the category, more bird-like, than other members of the category (such as ostriches and penguins). As members of the category move away from the pro- totype on such dimensions as size, capacity for flight, and nesting habits, they are perceived as less and less bird-like (though still birds). Prototype effects are why, for instance, most of us hesitate when asked to categorize an olive, but not an apple or a carrot. What I am suggesting, then, is that rhetoric of science be regarded as a cate- gory which includes a wide range of work, of varying centrality to the overall category. The prototypical concepts of rhetoric may vary to some degree among different schools of thought, just as prototypical birds differ among Americans, Africans, and Australians. But for me, as for most rhetoricians with classical al- legiances, the central concept is suasion, and the central discursive vehicle of suasion is the argument (dialectic or disquisitional). The central concept in sci- ence (again ignoring some variation, but again taking a representative position) is data, and the central discursive vehicle of data is the theory. In short, the pro- totypical notion in rhetoric of science is scientists arguing about science (that is, about data and theory). The further an analysis departs from this prototype,</page><page sequence="14">Rhetoric of Science 295 along dimensions such as suasive intent and empirical appeal, the further it de- parts from rhetoric of science. Since bigots of all stripes are fond of exploiting prototypes, I am compelled to add the following point immediately: there is nothing evaluative in this proposal. Prototype theory is not, despite the ease with which its proponents and explica- tors fall into comparative locutions like "a better example of a vegetable," an in- herently evaluative approach. An ostrich is not a worse bird than a robin. An olive is not a worse fruit than an apple. Weaver's analysis of the Scopes trial is not-because of its religious, public policy, and forensic components-a worse paper than, say, Block's analysis of Huxley's arguments in the mind-matter de- bate. It is just less central to the category of interest. For those so inclined, there are plenty of ways to evaluate Weaver against Block, but goodness of fit to the category, rhetoric of science, is not one of them. One other distinction needs to be made, and a fortiori, one observation, be- fore we can wrap up the discussion. The distinction hinges on the scholarly ne- cessity for abstraction, and the observation hinges on the fact that I am still making distinctions, having apparently renounced taxonomy only a few para- graphs back. Rhetoric of science papers, even at their most prototypical, come in two more flavors. The first is empirical. As Halloran points out, rhetoric shares with sci- ence the fact that it "has traditionally been a strongly empirical field of study" (70). That is, rhetoricians have always put "great emphasis on the particular case." This tendency, in fact, provides with another equally loose peg on which to hang the distinction between rhetoric of science and philosophy of science: the latter does not concern itself much with particular cases. (History, so- ciology, and psychology of science, like rhetoric, thrive on particular cases). The second flavor is theoretical, which introduces one last category with the horrendous label meta-rhetoric of science (the less barbarous rhetorical theory of science implies a higher level of systematicity than is apparent in the field). The interesting point about these papers (P. N. Campbell's "Poetic-rhetorical" and "Personae"; Gross's "Discourse"; Harris's "Assent"; Lyne's "Rhet- orics"; McGuire and Melia; Melia; Miller's "Some Perspective"; Nelson and McGeill; Nelson et al. "Inquiry"; Overington; Prelli; Schollmeier; Simons' "Are Scientists Rhetors," "The Rhetoric of Science," and "Chronicle"; Wander; Weimer; and Zappen's "A Rhetoric," "Historical Perspectives," "Historical Studies," and "Francis Bacon") is that many of them preceded the empirical work. In fact, most of the early papers on science in the rhetorical lit- erature were general rather than specific, and they drew their warrants, often undigested, from the philosophical literature. Now that rhetoric of science has taken the plunge these early papers proposed, the majority of work is in the form of rhetorical case studies-examining particular rhetors, movements, theories, or periods. Perhaps when we have built up a wider range of case studies, there will be more development in this area. In particular, there is much work to be done in the domain of epistemology-the investigation of how it is that scientists make knowledge through mutual suasion.</page><page sequence="15">296 College English The observation related to this requirement, a brief and perhaps redundant one, is that I have not abandoned taxonomy. Indeed, we haven't been bumping into the limits of taxonomy throughout this paper, just into the limits of pigeon holes and slots. Taxonomy is not as crude and dictatorial as I have made out. As the earlier discussion of the various approaches to studying science illustrates, prototype theory is, in fact, a theory of taxonomies. It is just a more flexible one than most, more tolerant of outliers and fuzzy boundaries. In Plato's terms, it is better bred. The taxonomy of empirical work in rhetoric of science I have been develop- ing, then, resolves into six fuzzy but identifiable categories, and these six cate- gories effectively capture the work done in the field to this point. The following list is not exhaustive, due to the softness of the borders with other humanist ap- proaches to science and to the wide range of venues rhetoricians of science have chosen for their work. In particular, there is no attempt here to include the work of discourse and argument analysts who don't view their work primarily as rhet- oric, no matter how rhetorically astute it is (see, for instance, Rudwick or Raup), nor the work of rhetoricians which falls more properly within another field (such as Halloran, "Technical Writing"; and Myers, "Persuasion"). But, classified somewhat arbitrarily in light of the above discussion, here is a fairly comprehen- sive list of the empirical studies: THE RHETORIC OF TECHNOLOGY: Farrell and Goodnight; Miller ("Public Knowledge" and "Technology"). THE RHETORIC OF RELIGION IN SCIENCE: Lessl ("Heresy" and "Science and the Sacred Cosmos"). THE RHETORIC OF SCIENTIFIC COMPOSITION: Bazerman ("Codifying," "Physicists," "Scientific Writing," "Studies," "Mod- ern Evolution," "What Written Knowledge," "Writing of Scientific Non- fiction," and Shaping); Bostian and Thering; Dowdy; Gross ("Form"); Halloran and Bradford; Harrington; Holmes; Moran ("A History," and "Joseph Priestly"); Myers ("Social Construction" and "Texts"); Rowan; Weaver (186-210); Whitburn and Halloran; Whitburn, et al. THE RHETORIC OF SCIENTIFIC LANGUAGE: Anderson ("The Rhetoric," "Scientific Nomenclature," and Between); Bruns; Carlisle; Paradis. THE RHETORIC OF PUBLIC SCIENCE POLICY: Bantz; J. A. Campbell ("Crisis of Ecology"); Gross ("Public Debates"); Guss- field ("Literary Rhetoric" and The Culture); Killingworth and Steffens; Miller ("Public Knowledge"); Mun6var; Shapiro; Waddell; Weaver (27-54). PROTOTYPICAL RHETORIC OF SCIENCE: Block; J. A. Campbell ("Darwin and The Origin," "The Polemical," "Charles Darwin," "Scientific Revolution," and "The Invisible Rhetorician"); Billig; Carlston; Dear; Edmondson; Fahnestock ("Accommodating Science" and "Ar- guing"); Fahnestock and Secor; Finocchiaro ("Logic" and Galileo); Gross ("On the Shoulders," and The Rhetoric); Halloran ("Molecular Biology"); Harris ("Argumentation" and "Ethos and Power"); Holmquest ("Rhetoric and Semi- otic" and "Rhetorical Argument"); Journet; Kelso; Klamer; Landau; Lyne ("Punctuated" and "Ways"); Lyne and Howe; McCloskey ("Notes," "The Rhetoric of Economics" [1], "The Rhetoric of Economics" [2], and The Rhet- oric of Economics); Moss; Myers ("Nineteenth Century" and "Every Picture"); Stephens ("Rhetorical Problems" and "Style as Therapy"); Warnick.</page><page sequence="16">Rhetoric of Science 297 Conclusion The prototype of a category is its default. When someone asks you to think of a bird or a vegetable, you are more likely to think of a robin or a carrot than an emu or rutabaga. And one of the points of this paper is that the default referent for rhetoric of science, the primary reflex of the field, is the investigation of sci- entific argumentation: how scientists argue, why they argue, and what the con- sequences are. Prototypically rhetorical events in science, then, are such things as the Bohr-Einstein debates during the birth spasms of quantum mechanics, the plate tectonics dispute in geology, and Darwin's long argument for evolution. This core set of concerns obviously has a number of children: the religious and technological substance of those arguments on one side of the family; the compositional, linguistic, and public policy features of those arguments on the other. Notice that this schema is cross cut in several ways. The most immediate distinction is the standard empirical-theoretical distinction that is endemic to ac- ademics. But all the classical interests of rhetoric also play important roles. Cer- tainly there are very clear instances of deliberative, ceremonial, and forensic dis- course in science-such as, respectively, the Cambridge DNA hearings, Nobel acceptance speeches, and the growing authority of genetic fingerprinting-but, as with other areas of discourse, these interests cut much deeper in science than a simple organizing principle. Science is, for instance, forensic to the roots, not just in the classical sense of finding true interpretations of evidence by weighing the cases that insistent advocates offer for opposing interpretations, but in the modern extension of the term-weighing physical evidence to solve a puzzle, like assessing powder burns to find the most likely range from which Colonel Mustard could have fired the revolver. Velikovsky, though a marginalized scien- tist, was right on the money in observing that a scientist is a detective and that theories "are often built upon minute details: a finger print on a bar of metal, a hair on a window sill, a burnt-out match in the bushes" (v). The deliberative and cermonial features of scientific discourse run as deep-as a deliberative analysis of the key Solvay conferences, or a reading of Polanyi in ceremonial (epideictic) terms, would clearly illustrate. The same is true of Aristotle's three classes of proof. Scientists, for the most part, believe that science is pure logos, but ethos unquestionably plays a very large role. Pathos, although usually far more under- stated even than ethos, is also significant-in bandwagon appeals, for instance, and in the subtle ad hominems and ad bacculums that function covertly in many disputes and overtly in periods of rancor. There are, in short, as many ways to carve up the topic as there are rhetorical knives. But Plato has another caution for us: the most important ability in tax- onomic work is the capacity "to divide into species according to natural articula- tions, avoiding the attempt to shatter the unity of a natural part, as a clumsy butcher might do" (Phaedrus ?266). The natural articulations of science are the borders it shares with religion and technology; the natural articulations of rhet- oric are the borders it shares with composition studies, language studies, and po- litical science. The other features that emerge when rhetoric meets science, such as the dependence on logos and the many forensic parallels, are best seen as</page><page sequence="17">298 College English blood and bone and sinew, not as joints (a point which is particularly evident in Gross's "Discourse"). They constitute science. They are common to all ex- tremities of the beast. They make it sensible to even talk about rhetoric of sci- ence. But they won't serve very well as classifying principles. Notice, though, that the program of this paper is precisely inverse to Plato's analogy, and the body is not complete with these distinctions. The limbs and joints need a torso, which is where prototype theory comes in. Rhetoric of sci- ence is, at its heart, a field preoccupied with scientific argumentation, with the vigorous dialectic of dissent and assent which digs up truths, grafts them to- gether, and makes knowledge. This metaphor has more than a passing resem- blance to my taxonomy. The lore of the rhetor and the lore of the scientist, stitched together on the table before you, may look disconcertingly like the work of Victor Frankenstein in his Hollywood period. I won't deny the parallels, but if you look at their seams, all theories have this quality. All raw data (ignoring that this phrase is an oxymoron) are random and chaotic, comprising a senseless flux; meaning comes from the interpretations we impose on snapshots of the flux. Prototype theory and the family resemblances among rhetoric, science, and their respective first cousins give some coherent life to a rapidly growing new field and chart some ripe directions for future development. It's nice when inter- pretations are beautiful, but there are more immediate concerns-respiration, for one. The comprehensive, straightforward, productive nature of this set of gener- al distinctions shows that-scars, bolts, and all-it breathes.
