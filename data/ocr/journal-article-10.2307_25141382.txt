<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BULLETIN OF THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART IN TWO PARTS THIRTY-FOURTH YEAR JUNE, 1947 NUMBER SIX: PART TWO REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1946 WILLIAM M. MILLIKEN, Director The year I946 was an extraordinary one for attendance. The number of visitors totaled 406,030, the second largest figure in the history of the Museum. This increased use of the Museum by the city as one of its main recreational and educational centers is important, but what is particularly gratifying is the fact that this result came from steady year-long growth, not from exceptional attendance at any especially popular special exhibition. The total achieved came within 12,000 of the record attendance in I936, the year of the Twentieth Anniversary Exhibition when visitors came from all over the country. There has been a gratifying augmentation of endowment funds. This is exceedingly important in view of the greatly in creased cost of maintaining the Museum with efficiency and of giving the free service to the public which is the Museum's wish and its ideal. Through the final settlement of the Krause Estate and the completion of payments to other beneficiaries, a residue of $60,470.0o has been formally set up as the William Krause Fund. Four new Contributing Endowment Funds, the Arthur L. and Virginia Brockway, the Elizabeth Brainard Thomson Denison, the Mrs. Harold A. Hallstein, and the Marion A. Parsons Contributing Endowment Funds, were established. These smaller funds are especially valuable and, as they are added to yearly, the increase of principal each year reaches a considerable sum. There are now 48 Membership Endowment Funds and I5 Contributing Endowment Funds, totaling in all $I23,072.02. A substantial amount was added to the John L. Severance Fund, the income to be devoted to purchases. Mem bership shows a total of 3,750 members, a gain of I 14. One of the essential duties of a Museum is to make available, and to make known, its collections through publication. A revolving Publications Fund was established several years ago. Through this and additional underwriting by Hanna Fund and 127</page><page sequence="2">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART by private donors, a series of Picture Books has been published; they are a record either of the collections or of special exhibi tions in which many Museum objects are included. Small color reproductions meet a growing demand. By these means scholars and others are becoming aware of the Museum's treasures. The Junior Council has developed remarkably and through its energy and interest is bringing many younger people into touch with the Museum. The members' knowledge of the Museum's collections and their appreciation and understanding of the problems which confront a public organization make them of great value in interpreting the Museum to the public. They have given valuable service as volunteers, have helped in planning and installing Christmas decorations, and with The Cleveland News they sponsored the Christmas Community Candlelight Program. This celebration on the Sunday before Christmas has become one of the most memorable events in the Museum year. Mrs. Oscar J. Lange, the Chairman, cooperated with Museum officials in every way possible. The Department of Paintings had an exceptional year, both in the number and quality of its gifts and in the distinction of its purchases. Hanna Fund made it possible for the Accessions Committee to secure three pictures in varied fields: an early example of the American painter John Sloan, "The Rathskeller"; the portrait of "The Boy with a Linnet" by Goya; and the "Danseuses ajustant leurs chaussons" by Edgar Degas. The Goya is a colorful and attractive portrait in the artist's early manner, painted about 1786, and is an admirable foil to the portrait of "Don Juan Antonio Cuervo," painted about thirty years later by the same artist and already in the Museum's collection. The combination of the blue and silver of the boy's clothes with the magenta bird cage against the golden back ground is a very happy one. The Degas ranks among the greatest masterpieces by that artist. Exceptional in size, the picture shows four figures seated in a row to form a horizontal design of dynamic impact. Color and three-dimensional form bind them together into a composition unique in Degas's work. Mrs. Henry White Cannon graciously presented a fine Florentine fifteenth-century tempera panel by Neri di Bicci. A rare and unusual seventeenth-century English portrait, repre sentative of the foreign influence so strong in Elizabethan 128</page><page sequence="3">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR England, was given by S. D. Wise. Three pastels were given by Edward B. Greene; they represent the work of two outstanding craftsmen in this medium, the Frenchman, Maurice Quentin de La Tour, and the Swiss, Jean ftienne Liotard, while the third is by the Englishman, Francis Cotes. The other gifts divide themselves naturally into several categories: a Dutch and a Flemish picture and several French canvases by Paul Albert Besnard and Eugene Carriere, given by Mrs. Ralph King and her four children in memory of Ralph King; and the charming "The Beach at Deauville" by Boudin, presented by Mrs. Homer H. Johnson. The remainder of the King gift consisted of French and English water colors, and of American works in the same medium by John Singer Sargent, John LaFarge, Maurice Prendergast, Gifford Beal, and others. Also by American artists were an oil by Max Bohm, given by Mrs. Ralph Perkins; a seascape by Louis M. Eilshemius from Mr. and Mrs. James N. Rosenberg and a landscape by James N. Rosenberg, himself, presented by Benjamin Javits, of New York; a pastel by John Henry Twachtman, the gift of E. R. Brumley; and an oil by Guy Pene du Bois from the Chester Dale Collection. A single water color by the Mexican, Frederico Cantih, was added by Mrs. Malcolm L. McBride. The other gifts were Cleveland art and included three paintings by the late Alexander Warshawsky, presented by Friends of the Artist; a Frank N. Wilcox, given in memory of H. Oothout Milliken; a Kae Dorn Cass, given by Mrs. Donald A. Gray for the Donald A. Gray Memorial Collection; and an oil by Lillian Orloff, a former Clevelander, offered by Benjamin Rubin. The purchases fall also into definite groups-old masters, nineteenth-century Americans, contemporary French and Americans, and among the latter, many Cleveland artists. Very distinguished is the fine view of the Roman Campagna painted by Claude Lorrain. This was added to the Mr. and Mrs. William H. Marlatt Collection. That, and "The Martyrdom of St. Sebastian" by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, a selection for the L. E. and D. E. Holden group of paintings, were the principal purchases in the first field. One very fine example of the work of the Frenchman Henri Matisse, "Fete des Fleurs, Nice," was also a Marlatt purchase. A signed and dated canvas by the American, Jasper F. Cropsey, was an exchange of the Horace I29</page><page sequence="4">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART Kelley Art Foundation; a John F. Kensett was also added through the Marlatt Fund. All the rest of the acquisitions were by contemporaries: a water color by the dean of American water colorists, John Marin-Marlatt Fund; an oil by Max Weber Hinman B. Hurlbut Fund; a water color by Henry G. Keller Cleveland Sesquicentennial Purchase Prize; and other Cleve land works by Keller, Sarisky, Teyral, Hahn, Ashdown, Man ning, Morrow, Eastman, and Vaiksnoras-the Silver Jubilee Treasure Fund or the Cleveland Traveling Exhibition Funds. Many loans of distinction were made to the Museum by Leonard C. Hanna, Jr., and the Museum, in turn, granted the loan of forty-eight pictures to twenty-six institutions. During I946 the Department of Prints and Drawings acquired three prints and eighteen drawings by purchase and 240 items by gift. The purchases were largely for the Dudley P. Allen Collection through the fund left by Dr. Allen. This collection has become the most important single section of the depart ment. These purchases include the monumental pen and wash drawing, a study for a Judgment of Paris, by the sixteenth century Venetian, Paolo Veronese. Another drawing purchased, of the same period but German, was the brush "Study of a Dead Blue Jay" signed by Hans Hoffmann, one of the most beautiful of Hoffmann's remarkable copies after Albrecht Diirer's studies from animal life. A hand-colored woodcut from a missal, pub lished in 1502 by Hans Burgkmair, and an engraving, "The Coat of Arms with a Cock," by Albrecht Diirer, were also Allen purchases, while a "Holy Family on the Flight into Egypt" by Albrecht Altdorfer was acquired by the James Parmelee Fund. The Hinman B. Hurlbut Collection, in which the objects are largelyAmerican, was strengthened by sixteen small pencil draw ings by the nineteenth-century artist, William Sidney Mount. The most important gift to this department was forty-nine prints and two drawings in memory of that great benefactor, Ralph King. These were offered by Mrs. King and her four children and include the rarity, a "Portrait of Henry II, of France," by Niccolo della Casa, four prints by Rembrandt, a Mary Cassatt, a group of Seymour Hadens, four Felix Buhots. The drawings were by Burne-Jones and Augustus John. The Mr. and Mrs. Lewis B. Williams Collection was largely added to by their individual gifts, which included twenty-four 130</page><page sequence="5">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR etchings by William Strang, twelve German little masters Aldegrever, Altdorfer, and others-and two lithographs by Boardman Robinson. Mrs. Ralph Perkins's gift of two complete sets of lithographs by Thomas Shotter Boys and two drawings by Arthur Rackham record the memory of Coburn Haskell. A feature of the accessions this year was the number of objects secured by trading to replace duplicates in various de partments. This was permitted by the terms of these gifts. Thus, the memory of generous donors is appropriately recorded. Included among these acquisitions are the engraving by Van Meckenem, a gift of Ralph King; an Albrecht Diirer, a gift of Mrs. Lee McBride; prints by Ludwig Krug, Paul Flindt, Hendrik Goltzius, Bernhard Zan, Aldegrever, Robert Havell, Boardman Robinson. The latter prints record the memories of Mrs. Henry Lefavour, Mrs. Edwin R. Perkins, Mr. and Mrs. F. E. Drury, Mrs. Warren H. Corning, Sr., Henrietta Baldwin Morris, Loie Fuller, Mrs. Mary Langley Herrick, Mrs. Horace Kelley, and Mrs. Sheldon. The Print Club, as usual, was extraordinarily generous. Four prints of exceptional quality by Diirer, Altdorfer, Delacroix, and Toulouse-Lautrec represent the catholicity of their inter ests. To these should be added the purchases of Cleveland works from the annual May Show, plus four lithographs by Steinlen, and works byLepere, Blampied,Tunnicliffe, and Schutz. It is interesting that 144 prints, or about two-thirds of the prints accessioned, were given by The Print Club or its members. Mrs. S. Prentiss Baldwin presented seven prints, of which four were Currier &amp; Ives prints presented on her ninety-fourth birthday. Mrs. Howard M. Hanna, E. R. Brumley, Mr. and Mrs. Theodore Spector, Victor Spark, Mrs. Malcolm L. McBride, Dr. and Mrs. Carlos E. Pitkin, Mr. and Mrs. Henry Trenkamp, Jr., Kennedy &amp; Co., and others added useful items. Additions were made to three memorials, the Mr. and Mrs. Charles G. Prasse, the Mary Spedding Milliken, and the Harry and Birdie Price Chamberlin Collections. The past year has been rich in acquisitions for the Decorative Arts Department. Of very special import were the two wonder ful sculptures acquired from the J. H. Wade Fund: the "St. Jerome and the Lion" in alabaster by Tilmann Riemen schneider, the great sculptor of Wiirzburg, and the "Adam and 13'</page><page sequence="6">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART Eve" in boxwood by Conrad Meit. These add not only great names, but what is more to be stressed, great works of art, to the group of German sculptures which feature the Museum. Two tiny Hispano-Moresque enamels were additional Wade pur chases. An unusual opportunity also made it possible to buy a group of Byzantine jewelry in gold and enamel and other crafts manship of the sixth and eleventh centuries. They come from various sources, by exchange, from the Dudley P. Allen, J. H. Wade, John Huntington, and Grace Rainey Rogers Funds; they add a most important series to the distinguished Byzantine ivories and miniatures which are already a feature in the Muse um's collections. Germain Seligman graciously gave a beautiful Limoges plate of painted enamel, sixteenth century, by Jean Limousin, in memory of his father, Jacques Seligmann. The first purchase from the newly established John L. Severance Fund was a notable one, the ormolu candelabrum by Jean-Joseph de Saint-Germain, dating about I750, from the collections of the Kings of Saxony and formerly in the Royal Schloss in Dresden. It adds a famous piece to the eighteenth-century section. The exhibition, "Art of the Americas," gave a special impetus to the Pre-Columbian collections, and as a result they have been added to greatly by an important series of generous gifts. Mrs. Benjamin P. Bole presented a unique anthropomorphic figure in gold from Cocle, Panama, and a gold pin in three-tone gold from Colombia, the latter the finest known of its kind. Mrs. Albert S. Ingalls gave two fine gold ornaments, one from Colombia and the other from Panama. Miss Helen Humphreys's memorial collection for her mother and father, Mr. and Mrs. Henry Humphreys, received three notable accessions in gold and a laughing-type head, Totonac, in terracotta. Mrs. R. Henry Norweb, in addition to her gift of textiles recorded with the accessions to the Textile Department, gave a bronze staff head and a mother-of-pearl ornament from Peru. John Wise gave a carved-thorn pin from Peru and two pottery bowls from Costa Rica. A gold plaque from a crown, Peruvian, Chavin Culture, from Lambayeque, purchased from the J. H. Wade Fund, supplemented the much published piece in the Dudley P. Allen Collection. A pottery bowl, Peruvian, Nazca, was secured for the James Albert Ford Memorial Collection. Mrs. Norweb continued her many loans in this section and added to them. 132</page><page sequence="7">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR In the section of pottery, porcelain, glass, and silver, R. Thornton Wilson gave three pieces of English ware, Stafford shire, of unusual quality, picked out with his unfailing taste. All of them are rarities and basic in the development of a ceram ic department. A. &amp; R. Ball presented a fine Tournai group. Two zwischengoldglas tumblers, Bohemian, eighteenth century, were added to the Mary Spedding Milliken Memorial Collec tion. A group of Cleveland ceramics and enamels by Chegin, Dyer, Lakofsky, Bates, and Jeffery were added to the same memorial. A sculpture by Goslee was the Rorimer Brooks Anni versary Award, and pieces by Boyer and Ayars were the Mrs. Roger Zucker Purchase Prizes. Two pieces of English silver by J. Wakelin and Robert Garrard came from Mrs. S. Prentiss Baldwin; a group of three pieces by the Bateman family, from Mrs. Charles W. Wason. A purchase of a silver teapot by John David was made from the J. H. Wade Fund. This supplements the representation of Philadelphia work. Important gifts in modern sculpture include pieces by Meunier, Rodin, Saint-Gaudens, Bourdelle, Gertrude Vander bilt Whitney, which were presented in memory of Ralph King by Mrs. King and her four children; and a group of five sculp tures by Max Kalish, of Cleveland, presented by Friends of the Artist. A notable purchase from the Hinman B. Hurlbut Collec tion was the model for the Impington Village College group by the contemporary English sculptor, Henry Moore. The Curator of Oriental Art had the honor of being asked to head the Office of Arts and Monuments in Tokyo. The Trustees generously made his service available to the Government, and he will be absent two years. Not only does this add great per sonal distinction to Mr. Hollis, but it will give him an unrivaled opportunity to study at firsthand the great collections of Japan. The Museum and his department gain greatly by this oppor tunity he has for study and service in the Far East. The pur chases in this department are for the moment necessarily few, but important are a fragmentary head of Buddha, Indian, Sarnath, fifth century, which was an exchange for the John Huntington Collection; an enameled pendant, Indian, Rajput, also an exchange, in this case for the J. H. Wade Collection. Also in exchange came two remarkable painted pottery jars, Chinese, Six Dynasties. A purchase for the Edward L. Whittemore '33</page><page sequence="8">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART Collection was a Siamese head of large scale and excellent qual ity, Lopburi, early fourteenth century. A gift of rarity and importance was a painted pottery tile, Chinese, fourth century, in memory of H. K. Heeramaneck, presented by his son and daughter-in-law, Nasli and Alice Heeramaneck. Gifts came from Mr. and Mrs. A. D. Brooks and Mary Gardiner Ford. The Textile Department made one of the greatest single acquisitions in its history, the remarkable Savonnerie tapestry panel of the Regency Period, made for the marriage of Isabella Maria de Merode to Count Frangois Joseph Czernin. It was a second outstanding acquisition for the John L. Severance Fund, building up the eighteenth-century collections from the point of view of tapestries. Savonnerie tapestries are rare at best, and this piece with its wonderful design, color, and fine preservation is unique in the collections of America. Other important pur chases were the Venetian velvet of about the year I475, an acquisition from the J. H. Wade Fund; and a group of five pieces from the Sangiorgi Collection, from the same source. A Fatimid roundel came from the Grace Rainey Rogers Fund. The gifts were no less remarkable. Mrs. R. Henry Norweb presented a mantle, turban band, and shoulder poncho, Peru vian, Paracas, one of the greatest ensembles of its kind known. This has been on loan for some years and its acquisition is a major event. To this Peruvian group John Wise added by gift the exquisite poncho corner of the Tiahuanaco Period. Henry Hunt Clark gave twelve silks of the seventeenth to twentieth centuries and three tapestry weaves of Coptic origin. The Tex tile Arts Club continued its gifts by the addition of a Persian velvet of about 600o and an embroidered English bag, seven teenth century. Other gifts came from Mr. and Mrs. Theodore Spector and Gertrude Ely Rossiter. The final gift, a bobbin-lace flounce, Brussels, Regency Period, came from Mrs. Edward S. Harkness in memory of Mrs. Stephen V. Harkness. It happened by chance that none of the important purchases for the Classical Department fell within the limits of the calendar year, so none are here recorded. Nevertheless, mention should be made here stressing the steady growth of this depart ment by acquisition of objects of quite exceptional quality. Special exhibitions of importance supplemented the perma nent collections. Of unusual interest was the exhibition, "The I34</page><page sequence="9">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR Arts of French Canada," organized by The Detroit Institute of Arts, The Cleveland Museum of Art, and the Albany Institute of History and Art. This exhibition was of particular value as showing the native arts of a part of the great nation to the north of the United States, a nation which has had such a part in the development of the Great Lakes region. "British Con temporary Paintings," circulated by the British Council, acquainted Clevelanders with the current status of the arts in Great Britain. A memorial exhibition of the works of Max Kalish and Alexander Warshawky was a tribute to two creative Clevelanders, and was much enjoyed by their many friends and admirers. "Portraits of Distinguished Negro Citizens," cir culated by The Harmon Foundation in New York, aroused a great deal of vital interest. Two photograph shows, "Power in the Pacific," battle photographs of the Navy in action, and "Photographs, I915-I945, by Paul Strand," a retrospective survey of one of America's greatest photographers, interested the many local followers of this medium. Two other exhibitions expressed the Museum's interest in the arts of America. The first was the "Seventeenth Exhibition of Contemporary Ameri can Oil Painting," the other was the perennially popular Annual Exhibition of Work by Cleveland Artists and Craftsmen. The year 1946 was for two reasons of great importance to the Department of Music. The first was the completion of the rebuilt McMyler organ. This was made possible by a large initiatory gift from Mr. and Mrs. Elroy J. Kulas, which was equaled by the Trustees and other donors. The second was the formation of the Musart Society. The work on the organ took twenty-three months, although the instrument was not out of use for nearly so long a time. Preliminary planning shortened the period, so that the Museum was not without one of its unique services for more than a year. It is now one of the finest instruments in existence. In its new form it was rededicated by two recitals by the Curator of Music. The formation of the Musart Society was all-important. Since the establishment of the Music Department in 1922 by the memorial gift of Mrs. P. J. McMyler and her two daughters, Mrs. Raymond Elliott Lawrence and Mrs. Charles F. Briggs, the McMyler Fund has been the backbone support of music in the Museum. The perennial difficulty of lowered income from 135</page><page sequence="10">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART investment has meant that a way had to be found to supple ment that income if the music programs were to be continued on the same level of quality as before. Through the enthusiasm of Mrs. T. Wingate Todd and Charles Roseman, a group of interested individuals came together and formed a society, called appropriately the Musart Society, which has made and will make possible in the future the continuation of the rich service the Museum gives the public. Like The Print Club and The Textile Arts Club, this society will supplement the activity of the department of the Museum in which it is interested. The music programs have attracted I6,074 interested listen ers during the year. Distinguished programs included three programs of chamber music by the Walden String Quartet, "Music for Violin and Harpsichord" by Alexander Schneider and Ralph Kirkpatrick, "Recital of New Songs" by Janet Fairbank, the "St. Matthew Passion by Bach" in Severance Hall, and a performance by the Pro-Arte String Quartet, sponsored by the Coolidge Music Foundation. Finally, the Community Christmas Carol Program featured again the Wa Li-Ro Boy Choir, directed by Paul Allen Beymer, and the Epworth-Euclid Church Choir, under Elwin Haskin. The Educational Department has had a most successful year, returning to almost pre-war conditions. New and capable staff members have taken some of the burden off the shoulders of those who carried it so well during difficult times. What is more, the department, under Dr. Thomas Munro and Mrs. Margaret Brown, is well organized to face the future. It is always with regret that the Museum faces the retirement of those who have served so well. Katharine Gibson Wicks retired in the middle of the past year, to carry out literary work which had long beckoned her. Her contribution to the department was basic. Increased transportation facilities have brought more classes to the Museum. If the Cleveland Public Schools could solve this problem more adequately, an even greater increase would ensue. The Museum has retained, as always, its most generous and cordial relations with the Cleveland Public School System. Coordination between the two organizations stems from Charles H. Lake and Alfred Howell. Ann V. Horton, Ronald Day, and Dana E. Church make of their relation to the schools a pattern which is a model for the country. Cleveland Heights Schools 136</page><page sequence="11">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR carry on as usual with their enthusiasm and understanding. They think of the Museum as an essential part of their program, and their loyal support through many years is a tribute to a sound working arrangement between the two organizations. The newly planned and carefully integrated program with the Shaker Heights System has again begun to function smoothly because of the cooperative attitude of their new superintendent. Other suburban schools as well as the parochial schools are seeking to deepen and enlarge their contacts with the Museum. Instruction in the Museum was ably handled. The fact that the Saturday morning staff remained largely the same meant that the program was off to a good start. Good attendance brought results. The successful contact of the Museum with the child is due to the groundwork laid by the Saturday classes. The Museum is a place where children are at home, and in an unin hibited relation the best results are obtained. The class for specially talented children has always been a special pride of the Museum. This class in the past has devel oped some remarkable talent. Many of the Saturday teachers, and others on the permanent staff of the Museum, are in them selves products of this class. The discovery of the abilities of many of the scholarship boys and girls now in The Cleveland School of Art has been due to the Museum's selective system, which gives special training to special ability. These classes were again financed by a most generous grant from the S. D. and May Wise Charitable Trust of the Jewish Welfare Federation. The Summer Outdoor Classes, made possible by the fund left by L. E. Holden for the development of interest in nature, have been so successful that it was necessary to restrict enrollment. The fortunate position of the Museum, with the beautiful Fine Arts Garden at its front door and with other areas of Wade Park surrounding it, gives an appropriate setting. A corps of experienced teachers has used these opportunities to the full. The Moving Picture Section has given a selected program. The balance maintained between English and foreign-language films gave variety. One particularly happy coordination was the use of the film Maria Chapdelaine at the time of the ex hibition of "The Arts of French Canada." An improved pro jection and sound system is imperatively needed. Increasing activity is to be noted in the Museum's work with I37</page><page sequence="12">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART institutions on the level of higher learning. Laurence Schmecke bier is regularly requiring the students from The Cleveland School of Art to visit the Museum and take notes. Lectures for museum audiences, specially suitable for art school students, were repeated for the benefit of the school as well. The Garden Center, through Arnold Davis, has offered valued advice and aid on the Holden Lectures, all of which have been sponsored by that organization as well. Western Reserve University has appointed a new Associate Professor of Art, Edmund H. Chap man, who is using the Museum extensively. The Curator of Education, as Professor of Art at Western Reserve University, and Mrs. Margaret Marcus, as a teacher in Flora Stone Mather College, relate the Museum directly to the University. Dr. Munro, as editor of The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, has brought the Museum intimately into relation with this important publication. The Circulating Exhibit Division was fully manned; in fact, a new assistant in that section was added. The result has been more adequate service to the schools, libraries, and other organ izations who look to the Museum for inspiration and leadership. The number of appeals made to the Museum and their distribu tion in every section of the community are proof of their need. The new station wagon so much needed is on order. The Library has been carried on with skill and ability. The difficulties caused by changing personnel have made this hard at times, but the record of accomplishment is high. The Library now has 22,I49 books and fulfills its duties as a reference library, pointing up the Museum collections and serving a public by books of general reference. It is used by graduate students of nearby institutions in increasing numbers. The work is divided between the book collections and those collections which may be lent. The latter portion consists of photographs in black and white and in color and in the large lantern slide collection. The photographs are classified and are in constant use. This portion of the department has, however, not developed in numbers greatly, because in the past years war conditions have made acquisition difficult. The lantern slides number now 50,286 and are an admirably organized and chosen group. They include a general and extensive selection of stand ard subjects, but the collection is marked by its wide specializa I38</page><page sequence="13">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR tion and by the considerable number of color slides; the number of accessions in the past few years has been predominantly in color. Over 2 1,000 slides were lent last year. The Publicity Department has been exceedingly successful in the standard and in the widespread distribution of its material. The ingenuity and cleverness with which stories were placed in unusual and telling sections of the newspapers has paid large dividends in interest. A great deal of the credit for increased attendance has been due to this intelligent distribution. The ready cooperation of the newspapers and other agencies has made this publicity possible. The radio programs have been varied and have kept the Museum in its many functions before the public. Permanent collections, special exhibitions, and spe cial services have been stressed in appropriate proportion. The Photograph Department both records the Museum collections and at the same time provides the photographs and postcards for sale at the Sales Desk, as well as making the large number of lantern slides. The Printing Department prints the labels, programs, forms of all kinds, and services the material sold at the Sales Desk. These two departments, closely inter related, give an often unrecognized service. They are a part of the Museum behind the scenes which interprets it to the public. The Tea Room is an essential and much used convenience; because of the position of the Museum far from restaurants, it is invaluable to the staff and a very large public, both children and adults. In spite of post-war difficulties it has maintained its reputation for hospitality and for good food, well cooked. The Department of Buildings and Grounds has felt the labor stringency. However, the devotion of tried employees has kept the services at a high level. The members of the department, particularly those who have served for many years, are marked by efficiency and loyalty. Obsolescent equipment is being re placed, and reconditioning is a part of the program. A word of appreciation is due to the Museum personnel in all departments who have, by their individual and collective action, made the Museum a useful and forward-looking institu tion. Any institution is only as good as its parts, and coopera tion, willing and unquestioned service, have helped materially in making the Museum what it is. It is a friendly Museum which ties in at multitudinous points to the vital life of a great city.
