<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Mechanical versus the Math- ematical Conception of Nature BY PHILIPP FRANK (TRANSLATED BY PHILIP SHORR) I. HOW IDEALISTS AND MATERIALISTS VIEW MODERN PHYSICS . *H--"NHEN science of the 2oth century is spoken of in opposition to that of the Igth century, a partic- ularly characteristic attribute is often cited: namely, that since the time of Galileo and New- ton the task of science has been to explain everything mechanistically. By analogy the world was to be conceived as a great machine. But the theories of the 20th century, above all the relativity and quantum theo- ries, caused a revolution in science. It is seen today that nature can be described and understood not 'mechanistically' but only through abstract mathematical formulas. The world is no longer a machine but a mathematical formula. Great significance has also been attached to this revolution for the philosophical world-view. It was said: a mathematical for- mula is something purely mental. The world therefore can no longer be understood in a materialistic sense. Materialism must be superseded by idealism. The physics of the 2oth century is a victory for the "spiritualist" or, as it is sometimes less clearly ex- pressed, idealistic world-view. This view-point has its representatives both among the idealists and materialists. The former rejoice at the unexpected aid they 41</page><page sequence="2">42 Mechanical vs. Mathematical have received for their world-view from the progress of science itself. The latter blame modern physics for abandoning the paths of progress begun by Galileo and Newton and for promoting the return to the dark views of the Middle Ages. We will cite from the works of a few English and German authors to illustrate the point of view of the idealists, and from the works of Soviet authors, the fears of the materialists. At the centennial of the British Association of Science in I93I General J. C. Smuts, its president, characterized the science of our times as opposed to that of the last century in the following manner: "There is the machine or mechanistic world-view dominant since the time of Galileo and Newton, and now, since the coming of Einstein, being replaced by the mathematician's conception of the universe as a symbolic structure of which no mechanical model is possible.... Into this scheme (of the mechanistical conception) it has been difficult, if not impossible, to fit entities like life and mind.... The space-time relativity conception of the world has overcome the difficulty by destroying the old concept of matter and reducing it from a self-subsistent entity to a configuration of space-time, in other words, to a special organisation of the basic world-structure. If matter is essentially immaterial structure or organisation, it cannot fundamentally be so different from organisation or life, which is best envisaged as a principle of organisation, or from mind, which is an active organisator." In his well known book, ithe Mysterious Universe, the famous physicist, Sir James Jeans, expresses similar views even more clearly. He says for example: "The signal for the revolution was a short paper which Einstein published in June I905. And with its publication, the study of the inner working of nature passed from the engineer-scientist to the mathematician.... The essential fact is simply that all pic- tures which science now draws of nature, and which alone seem capable of according with observational fact, are mathematical pictures... nature seems very conversant with the rules of pure mathematics, as our mathematicians have formulated them in</page><page sequence="3">P. Frank 43 their studies, out of their own consciousness and without drawing to any appreciable extent on their experience of the outer world. ... Our remote ancestors tried to interpret nature in terms of an- thropomorphic concepts of their own creation and failed. The efforts of our nearer ancestors to interpret nature on engineering lines proved equally inadequate. Nature refused to accommo- date herself to either of these man-made moulds. On the other hand, our efforts to interpret nature in terms of the concepts of pure mathematics have, so far, proved brilliantly successful. It would now seem to be beyond dispute that in some way nature is more closely allied to the concepts of pure mathematics than to those of biology or of engineering. ... In any event, it can hardly be disputed that nature and our conscious mathematical minds work according to the same laws. She does not model her be- havior, so to speak, on that forced on us by our whims and passions, or on that of our muscles and joints, but on that of our thinking minds.... The universe cannot admit of material repre- sentation, and the reason, I think, is that it has become a mere mental concept.... To my mind, the laws which nature obeys are less suggestive of those which nature obeys in its motion than of those which a musician obeys in writing a fugue, or a poet in com- posing a sonnet ... the universe can be best pictured as consisting of pure thought, the thought of what, for want of a wider word, we must describe as a mathematical thinker." We see the physicist and astronomer Jeans has made use of this turn from a 'mechanistic' to a 'mathematical' understanding of physics to favor an uncertain religiously-tinted metaphysics. When the professional German philosophers, on the other hand, deal with this revolution in science, we find them erecting a 'scientific' metaphysics on this foundation. To illustrate this tendency we will quote a few passages from B. Bavink's Science and Religion. After the author has shown that modern wave mechanics introduces the significant wave func- tion only as probability, he says: "But a mathematical probability is not a physical reality like a temperature or field strength or what not. With this new inter- pretation the whole material notion of substance disappears in</page><page sequence="4">44 Mechanical vs. Mathematical our hands. What remains then of the plain hard sharp heavy matter! A certain probability depending on formal mathemati- cal laws, that energy or impulse is observable in a certain world- point .... The physicist of to-day has learned an enormous advance from the point of view of his world-view that his atoms or electrons or whatever they may be are no longer to be regarded as 'rigid blocks of reality', from which no path can be found into the mental and spiritual realm: he sees far more, that all these structures are forms in perpetual flux which are only of interest to him as regards their form. In this manner, every time materialism is super- seded." In this necessary mathematical conception of nature Bavink, like Jeans, sees the foundations of an idealistic philosophy of physics and hence of science as a whole. The only difference is that he (Bavink) uses somewhat more technical philosophical terms. One task Bavink proposes for an idealistic philosophy of nature is the following: "It must still be shown how matter may be derived from pure psycho-mental data of the world. It is notorious how this pur- pose of idealism has always been wrecked. It never succeeded even in deriving the nature of a hydrogen atom from such psychic data. What is new in the situation today is that such a proposal is no longer as absurd today as it was even 20 years ago. For that which was until now an insuperable obstacle to such a pro- posal,-the 'rigid blocks of reality' of the unfortunate atomism,- has been resolved into pure form; and a mathematical form is as such something mental; it belongs, as Plato already saw, directly in the realm of the logos which is behind all things.... There it stands this hard, cold, sober world of matter and its atoms, the existence of which has been proven beyond doubt. It is impossible to pass it by. All idealists ought to realize that, and thus to put an end to such useless attempts. The material world will be ruled by the mind only then when we really under- stand it as a product of mental powers. It doesn't help us in the least merely to postulate it, as idealisms in the past have done.</page><page sequence="5">P. Frank 45 The material world and its worshipers, the materialists, will only ridicule us saying: Here is a single atom, the simplest of all, the hydrogen atom. Here, show us what you can do! If you can show us how we can conceive this as a product of psychic powers (potencies) then we will believe you. It seems that idealism can actually pass this test today. I will not assert that it has already passed it, but it can not be doubted that it is very close to it and has good prospects of success." Some professional philosophers look upon modern physics as a direct return to the anthropomorphic-animistic physics of the Middle Ages, as it was practiced by Aristotelian scholasticism. Thus Aloys Wenzl, Professor at the University of Munich, says in his essay, The Metaphysics of Modern Physics: "And in this manner the human struggle for insight in theworld will have described a circle, or more correctly a zig-zag line. The examination of nature began with an anthropomorphic representation of the material world, in that souls were ascribed to material things, and the relations between them were viewed as expressions of psychic relationships of love and hate. The tendency to reification led farther and farther away from such early representations, freed physics more and more from such images and of necessity led ever more toward a mathematical examination of nature. For there are two possible ways of mak- ing the facts of experience and the laws of experience meaningful. They must either be treated according to psychological laws or associated with the ideal forms of mathematics. Modern physics has followed this second method as far as possible. But if more is desired; if assertions about their meaning are to be made, the mathematically expressed relationships must be explained. In this fashion a much higher plane, leading back to the original method is reached if not in physics, then in metaphysics." If, then, we observe how a philosopher of the 20th century 'ex- plains' the physics of his day, we will see that the 'idealistic' ex- planation is not so far removed from the 'spiritistic' or mystical. In the same essay, Wenzl says: "Therewith it is clear that the concept of matter has changed completely.... Only the mathematical method itself actually</page><page sequence="6">46 Mechanical vs. Mathematical defines the sphere of the material world. But we can no longer associate an idea of something dead, with this material world. If we do wish to make an assertation about its essence, it is much sooner a world of elemental spirits which are bound in their rela- tionships and their formation of wholes to certain rules of the spiritual realm, that can only be comprehended mathematically; or to put it in other words, it is a world of lower spirits whose reciprocal relationships can be expressed in a mathematical form. We don't know what kind of relationships this mathematical form signifies. But we know the form. Only the mathematical forms themselves or God might know their inner significance. A very alert metaphysician might explain them at best by analogy to known psychic relationships." All these utterances show what great hopes the supporters of idealism had in the crisis in physics of the Igth and 20th century, and still have today. But just as some political systems adopt idealism as the foundation for their philosophy, so the supporters of Communism acknowledge materialism as a foundation for their world-view. When we read the writings of the spiritual leaders of Commu- nism, we see everywhere that the crisis in physics and its utiliza- tion as propaganda for idealism is viewed with concern and alarm. We need only glance at Lenin's moving philosophical chef d' oeuvre of contemporary Communism, which was published in 1908 under the title: Materialism and Empirio-criticism: Notes on a Reactionary Philosophy. The fifth chapter is entitler ? "The Latest Revolution in Science and in Philosophical Idealism." Lenin speaks of the changes made in the conception of matter by the energetic and electromagnetic theories. The physicists inclined toward idealism often formulate the results of these new conceptions as follows: 'The atom is dematerialized. Matter disappears.' And the Russian philosopher Valentinov who is an acknowl- edged supporter of Mach draws the (following) inference with reference to a world-view: "The assertion that a scientific explanation of the world is found</page><page sequence="7">P. Frank 47 in the simple foundation of materialism, is now no more than a myth, and a foolish one at that." Says Lenin, "there isn't the slightest doubt about the associa- tion of the new physics, or rather a certain school of the new phys- ics, with the school.of Mach and other types of a modern ideal- istic philosophy." "The nature of the crisis in modern physics consists in the over- throw of old laws and fundamental principles. Objective reality outside of consciousness is rejected and materialism is replaced by idealism and agnosticism. Matter has disappeared. This is the way the basic and typical difficulty created by the crisis is expressed." Even in the year I922 when Lenin was already at the head of the Soviet Government of Russia, he was much concerned about the dangers for the materialism that might and did arise out of the crisis, and therewith form the foundations of Communism. At that time it was the relativity theory that played the most important part in the crisis in physics. On December 3, 1922, Lenin wrote in the Journal, Under the Banner of Marxism: "We must keep in mind that as a result of the revolution taking place in science today, reactionary philosophical schools and tend- encies are likely to arise. Therefore, the journal, Under the Ban- ner of Marxism, must be concerned about this revolution in modern science, otherwise, struggling materialism can be neither struggling nor materialism. If the great majority of middle class intellegenzia stands behind Einstein, who is not taking an active part in the fight against materialism, then it holds not only for Einstein, but for most of the great scientists since the end of the Igth century." We find the same fears and the same struggle, if we examine the latest text books that have been introduced in Soviet colleges for teaching materialism. Thus we find in the text books, Dialectic Materialism, (v. I pp. I I I ff.) published in 1934 under the editor- ship of M. Mitin of the Moscow Philosophical Institute of the Communist Academy: "The attempts made to think of motion without matter and of</page><page sequence="8">48 Mechanical vs. Mathematical force without underlying substance are laying the foundation for idealism and clericalism. At the present time we see the further- ing of these same idealistic tendencies. As a result of their asso- ciation with Einstein's Theory of Relativity many are inclined to imagine motion without matter." The misuse of modern physics as propaganda for idealism is very clearly described in the following passages. In the Russian materialistic literature since Lenin, it seems, the followers of Mach are cited as representatives of subjective idealism. Thus on p. 55 ibid. it is said: "In place of the old unchangeable atoms there has appeared a system of moving electrons. Therefore, say the 'Machians', matter has disappeared. But actually, more exact principles are replacing primitive physical laws. Yet the followers of Mach say: There is no objective knowledge.... The latest quantum mechanics strengthens the concept of causality, and makes cor- rections in the old concept. The Machians, however, declare, that causality has disappeared." In the latest Russian materialistic literature there is a great deal of criticism of the new physical theories, particularly quan- tum mechanics, on account of their mathematical and formalistic nature. In effect it is much like that of the German and English idealists (e.g. Bavink and Jeans). Only the materialists are naturally critical about the replacement of mechanics by mathe- matics as an 'idealistic' trend. I will cite as evidence an article that appeared in a Russian popular science journal, Krasnaya Nov. In the article entitled "Chemistry and the Structure of Matter," the author Orlov says: "Quantum mechanics is today still under the spell of the fetish, mathematics. This means that the method of quantum me- chanics is of a formal mathematical nature. The mathematical pattern permits the building of a bridge that unites empirical facts furnished by spectroscopy with the conduct of electrons, atoms, and molecules. But up to now we have no physical ex- planation for the formulas of quantum mechanics. Instead of that, it is often proposed to abandon the search for an interpreta- tion of physical laws and to replace physical representations with</page><page sequence="9">P. Frank 49 abstract mathematical symbols. It is in this that the fetish, mathematics consists." We see from all this with what determination they are continu- ally referring to the philosophical importance of the physics of the 20th century. It is remarkable how often scientists with sym- pathies for idealism, philosophers with scientific inclinations but of a spiritualistic shade, and advocates of materialism as a tool of political progress agree with one another in so many essential points. But at this point we must put the following question: Is it really correct to see in the physics of the 2oth century a tran- sition from a 'mechanical' to a 'mathematical' explanation, from a materialistic palpable or intuitive perceptibility (Anschaulich- keit) to a mathematically abstract intellectual spirituality? (Geistigkeit) Or has the rebirth of idealism entirely different sources, and is simply dragging along with it whatever material comes to hand? II. PHYSICS OF THE I9TH CENTURY The physics of Galileo and Newton which put an end to the animistic period was designated affectionately as 'mathematical'. At that time Newton wrote fhe Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy. Pronounced anti-materialistic tendency was as- cribed to the work, because obvious palpable impacts of masses upon one another were replaced by a pure mathematical formula, the law of attraction. The physics of Galileo and Newton came to be called 'mechanis- tic' only after the development of mechanics, which made more rapid progress than all other fields. It then became customary to use the treatment of mechanics as a model for every other field. The Newtonian mechanics was looked upon ever more as the standard type of a theory, so to speak, so that Helmholtz, for example said: "To understand a phenomenon means nothing else than to reduce it to the Newtonian laws. Then the necessity of explana- tion has been satisfied in a palpable way." It was completely forgotten that in Newton's day, his own theory was looked upon as an abstract mathematical formula,</page><page sequence="10">Mechanical vs. Mathematical 50 which needed a mechanical or physical explanation to satisfy man's need for causality. Newton himself recognized it, and only declined to take part in it himself, when he made the now well known remark, "Hypotheses non fingo". But men like Huyghens and Leibniz never considered the Newtonian Theory as empirically satisfying, but always only as a mathematical formula. Already in the very beginning of the development of mechanistic physics, it was seen that it is not easy to establish the contradiction between a 'mechanistic' and a 'mathematical' theory. In the course of time what great advantage was found in the mechanistic theories? At first it was uniformity (Einheitlichkeit) in all science, which, it was hoped, might be attained by reducing everything to mechanics, the most developed branch of science. But as that became ever more difficult and it was shown, for example, that an energetic or electro-magnetic representation was better adapted to bring all of physics or all of science under a unified theory, an entirely new advantage was discovered in mechanical theories. Namely, intuitive perceptibility (Anschau- lichkeit). Whilst even in Descartes' time, the very 'mathemati- cal' in the physical theories guaranteed their 'Anschaulichkeit' one began to find a contradiction between 'mathematical' and 'anschaulich', and to assert that only the reduction to mechanics guaranteed the Anschaulichkeit in a theory and that without Anschaulichkeit no real understanding was possible. It was claimed, for example, that Maxwell's field equations of electro- dynamics are not 'anschaulich', if they are not illustrated with a mechanical model. It may be said that there were two motives involved in the resistance to the abandonment of mechanism. They were: A. There was no inclination to renounce the advantages of 'conceivability' which were ascribed to mechanistic theories only. B. The achievements of Galilean-Newtonian epoch in mecha- nistic physics were defended, because it was feared that the aban- donment of mechanistic explanations would lead to a return to medieval animistic authropomorphic science. But if we speak again of this desire for Anschaulichkeit, we</page><page sequence="11">P. Frank 51 ought to be clear as to the actual meaning of the term. The mechanical laws describe for us the grosser experiences of daily life, experiences in the use of tools such as firearms, lifting appara- tus etc., as well as the most familiar experiences concerning the movements of the planets. We find it necessary to understand all other experiences as analogous to those that are most familiar. The physics of the Igth century has already shown that this wish cannot be fulfilled. Electromagnetic phenomena cannot be reduced to the same mechanical laws that govern weapons, tools, etc. Nevertheless the laws concerning electromagnetic phenomena may be considered in a broader sense as also 'anschaulich'. Only in this case we must consider how we can verify experimentally the accuracy of such physical laws as for example, Maxwell's field equations. We must derive from them an experimental result that is directly observable. But what kind of an observation is it? It is observed where the pointer of an ammeter or of some other measuring apparatus appears or how some colored spot is displaced. But they are precisely the same kind of observations that help to verify the laws of ordinary mechanics. In the end only gross mechanical events, which alone are observed, are de- rived from the equations of the electro-magnetic field. And that holds, as we will see, everywhere in physics even in that of the 20th century. In this the physical laws must always be 'An- schaulich', if they are to have any scientific meaning at all. For without 'Anschaulichkeit' in the western sense, they are not experimentally verifiable. An explanation of fundamental equations using Anschauung on the contrary, is not a necessary demand of science. For the fundamental equations above cannot be submitted to any direct experimental verification. This 'non-Anschaulichkeit' of funda- mental laws already existed in Maxwell's theory of the electro- magnetic field. The 'electrical perturbation in a vacuum' was, for example, something entirely non-anschaulich, and yet a very essential element of this theory. For a long time an effort was made to get a mechanical explana- tion of Maxwell's theory. For there was always the feeling that</page><page sequence="12">52 Mechanical vs. Mathematical without it, something essential was missing to the understanding of electromagnetic phenomena. Heinrich Hertz finally cut the Gordion knot, so to speak, when he said: "Maxwell's Theory is nothing else than Maxwell's equations. That is, the question is not whether these equations are anschaulich, i.e. can be inter- preted mechanistically, but only whether anschaulich, interpret- able conclusions can be derived from them by means of gross mechanical experiments." Therewith was founded what we call today, the 'positivistic conception' of physics. Positivistic physics thus replaced mecha- nistic physics. And now the mechanistic explanation as a foundation could be abandoned, without at the same time re- nouncing the achievements of the Galilean-Newtonian epoch. With the aid of a positivistic conception of physics the rejection ofmediaval animism was as complete as ever. The fear expressed in Bavink of the result of the abandonment of mechanistic physics became unjustified. In place of the mechanical model there was the mathematical formula with its experimentally verifiable results. In this sense, it may be said, that the positivistic con- ception had compensated the mechanistic interpretation with a mathematical one. Before anything was as yet known about relativity or quantum theories, before, therefore, even the 'rebirth of spiritualistic physics in the 2oth century', Hertz, Mach, Duhem and others had already seen the essential point in every explana- tion of nature not in the mechanical model but rather in the con- struction of functional dependents. The historical error is often made of connecting the struggle of Mach and Duhem for the positivistic physics with their aversion for atomism, so that a victory for atomism was considered a defeat for positivism. In reality the champions of atomism, Maxwell and Boltzmann, were exactly of the same opinion concerning the general nature of a physical theory as Hertz and Mach. The difference in their views about the value of atomistic theories touched only upon the different estimate placed upon the suitability of these theories for the reproduction of physical phenomena. The opposition was a purely technical one, but by no means one of judgment or as we would rather say today, of scientific logic.</page><page sequence="13">P. Frank 53 With the aid of a few statements from the writings of Maxwell and Boltzmann we can easily be convinced about what they thought concerning the structure of physical theories and their connection with experience. In the introduction to his treatise, On Faraday's Lines of Force, J. C. Maxwell expressed himself quite clearly on these questions. Boltzmann says in his notes to the German translation of this work: "Maxwell's introduction proves that he was as much of a pioneer in the theory of knowledge as he was in theoretical physics. All the new ground in the theory of knowledge that was broken in the next forty years, is already clearly marked out in these few pages; indeed the very ideas are illustrated. Later epistemolo- gists treated all this more fully, but also with greater bias. Then they set up rules for the further development of the theory after it had already developed and not before, as was the case here." Thus Maxwell describes how he first came upon the mathemati- cal formulation of the well known laws of electricity and of mag- netism, and then upon the formulation of the new laws including the mathematical concepts so created: "In order therefore to appreciate the requirements of the sci- ences the student must make himself familiar with a considerable body of most intricate mathematics, the mere retention of which in the memory materially interferes with further progress. The first process therefore in the effectual study of the science, must be one of a simplification and reduction of the resultants of pre- vious investigation to a form in which the mind can grasp them. The results of this simplification may take the form of a purely mathematical formula or a physical hypothesis." But Maxwell does not by any means think that there is an essential antithesis between a 'purely mathematical formula' and a 'physical hypothesis'. He judges both only according to their practical exchange value, and finds that each of the two has its advantages and disadvantages. Hence he looks for a kind of theory that is more general than either of them and that combines the advantages of both without the disadvantages. This more general sort of theory Maxwell finds in the physical analogy. It comprehends both the physical hypothesis, in which an analogy</page><page sequence="14">54 Mechanical vs. Mathematical is drawn between electromagnetic events and a mechanical model, and a mathematical formula which is only an analogy between a field of phenomena such as those of electricity and certain number relationships that are given by the electromagnetic field equations. We will cite only a few characteristic propositions from Max- well: "In the first case (of a purely mathematical formula) we entirely lose sight of the phenomena to be explained and though we may trace out the consequences of given laws, we can never obtain more extended views of; the connections of the subject. If, on the other hand we adopt a physical hypothesis, we see the phe- nomena only through a medium, and are liable to that blindness to facts and rashness in assumption which a partial explanation encourages.... In order to obtain physical ideas without adopt- ing a physical theory we must make ourselves familiar with the existence of physical analogies. By a physical analogy I mean that partial similarity between the laws of one science and those of another which makes each of them illustrate the other. Thus all the mathematical sciences are founded on relations between physical laws and laws of numbers, so that the aim of exact science is to reduce the problems of nature to the determination of quan- tities by operation with numbers. Passing from the most uni- versal of all analogies to a very partial one, we find the same resemblance in the mathematical form between two different phenomena giving rise to a physical theory of light." In the introduction to his lectures on the theory of gases Boltz- mann's view is brought out very clearly. In one place he says: "The question as to the fitness of the atomistic philosophy is naturally wholly untouched by the fact stressed by Kirchhoff that our theories about nature bear the same relation to it as symbols to the things symbolized, as letters to sounds or as musical notes to tones; and by the question whether it may not be expedient to consider our theories as pure descriptions so that we may always recall their relation to nature. Therefore the question is whether the pure differential equations or atomism will one day turn out the more complete descriptions of phenomena." The opposition between Boltzmann and Mach therefore was</page><page sequence="15">P. Frank 55 only in a difference of opinion as to whether the atomic theory constitutes a suitable medium for the description of experience, but by no means in a different understanding of the functions of a physical theory-as is often asserted by the mechanists and meta- physicists of the animistic-mystical school. There is no doubt today that Mach's views concerning the worthlessness of atomism were often erroneous. But that was also the case on occasion with the physicists of the metaphysical school. The criticism made by Planck of Mach's conception of centrifugal forces need only be recalled. According to Mach these (forces) were to be determined by the relative motions of the bodies. This theory seemed absurd to Planck. Yet it soon after formed the basic idea of Einstein's gravitational theory. We have seen that the transition from mechanistic to mathe- matical physics was the work of the positivistic doctrine in science and that it had nothing to do with the 2oth century tendency toward idealism and metaphysics. But it may well be, and that is often also declared, that posi- tivistic physics itself has an element of spiritualism or idealism in it. The mathematical laws of which it consists, are brought into relation with sense perceptions, by means of assigned relation- ships, and directions for measuring magnitudes, represented by mathematical symbols. By means of such relationships, mathe- matical equations yield propositions about observations. It may therefore be said that positivistic physics consists of propositions about observations or perceptions. But then, so it is often ex- pressed, it asserts something about the psychic. It has com- pletely abandoned materialism and exactly like psychology has become a science of the mind. In fact, Ernst Mach built up all the sciences out of relationships of sensation. Many, therefore, look upon positivistic physics as a variety subjective idealism, which declares that science can never assert anything about the actual world, but subjective sense impressions. In the above mentioned book, Materialism and Empiriocriticism, Lenin represented Mach's doctrine as a direct continuation of Bishop Berkeley's philosophy. He also blamed this doctrine for depreciating the actual world and for promoting the view that</page><page sequence="16">56 Mechanical vs. Mathematical behind the world of sense impressions about which alone science can assert something, lies the real world; but that is inaccessible even to science. According to this view of Lenin's, Macli seeks to strengthen the belief that the real world can only be explored through extra scientific or superscientific sources of knowledge such as metaphysics and religion. This view of Mach's doctrine, however, is completely contra- dicted by Mach's actual inclinations. To be sure it must be admitted that his terminology might sometimes be a cause for such confusion. Also many of his disciples were in effect inclined toward idealism perhaps because of pressure to conform to the prevailing official philosophy according to which everything smacking of materialism was strictly taboo. For Mach himself, the sensations with which he built up the entire science, were in no contradiction to the actual world that seemed inaccessible to reason. For him these sensations, which to avoid confusion he very often termed 'elements', were the building material he wished to use to create a unified system of science; this could be accomplished if one crossed from one field of science to another e.g. from physics to physiology. For Mach the difference between the apparent and the real world could not at all be scientifically formulated. Yet the wholly gross mechanistic philosophy stood in no logical contra- diction to Mach's conception. The bodies of daily experience with which mechanism constructed its world were also nothing else than a complex of sight and taste sensations. The question whether there really is a matter (a thing-in-itself) that is different from the sensation has no meaning for science since no experiment can be performed that might possibly settle the question. Every proposition about a gross material thing can also be expressed as about sensations. Thus the whole of mechanistic physics can be translated into the language of Mach. Yet this language is much more comprehensive. Even though physics will not be reduced to mechanics, there is always the possibility of interpreting it as a system of propositions about elements of sensation. Mach admits a much more general building material than does mechanism. Mach's doctrine,</page><page sequence="17">P. Frank 57 therefore, need not be looked upon as, 'overcoming of material- ism' but rather as a generalization that includes the mechanistic materialism as a special case; which presumably is not in a position to embrace all of science. A logical contradiction exists only between a metaphysically conceived Machism, which is, then, subjective idealism, and a metaphysically conceived ma- terialism which accepts matter only as having existence. But this doctrine was invented by idealists to refute materialism, and was, in any case, hardly representative of scientifically minded materialists. The Neo-positivistic tendency represented by Carnap and the 'Vienna group', takes its point of departure from Mach, but so formulates its philosophy that it is quite impossible to confuse it with idealistic or solipsistic doctrines. For the new positivism the question of the existence of a real world behind our sensations is only a pseudo-problem. The raw material of science does not consist of elements of sensation or of bodies, but of propositions. Science is made up of a system of propositions in an inter-subjec- tive language i.e. a language intelligible to all, of which 'physical language' is considered a type. In the exact sciences the intersubjective language consists of mathematical formulae from which observational propositions can be derived with the aid of laws of logic and prescriptions for measurement. We see then that it was positivism that repaired mechanistic science with mathematics. Yet it does not interpret either mechanics or mathematics metaphysically; nor does it find any sharp contradiction between the two types of physical theory, except the difference between a general mathematical and a special mechanical theory, as Maxwell already explained in the passage quoted above, from his work on Faraday's Lines of Force. But the professional philosophers did not have to wait for the relativity and quantum theories of the zoth century to miscon- strue the transition from mechanistic to mathematical theory. They succeeded in doing this with the physics of the Igth and earlier centuries. On more than one occasion they made use of the explanation of Mach's doctrine as subjective idealism. It</page><page sequence="18">58 Mechanical vs. Mathematical was even simpler than that. Wherever they saw something mathematical they tried to explain it as an ideal element that has found its home in materialistic physics. Hermann Cohen, for example, the leader of the Neo-Kantian school of Marburg, says that mechanics has acquired a more spiritual character when such subtle mathematical concepts as the differential quotients had to be used to formulate its laws. In the critical supplement to the seventh edition of Fr. A. Lange's History of Materialism (Vol. I pp. 504 ff) Hermann Cohen says: "The road of research leads straightway to idealism. Materialism is being destroyed at the roots of physical concepts, and it is mathematics that is leading in the emancipation which promises to be a lasting one.... Is there any other method of explaining reality, let alone establishing it, if not for the New- tonians' mass and force, or for the dynamicists' electrical mass? Is there any other method than the differential?" Cohen shows however that something spiritual is to be derived from the differential. But we have seen in part I that the idealistic interpretation of science, when taken seriously, is the first step in the return to an animistic anthropomorphic science of the medieval scholastics. Positivism on the other hand particularly in its present form of a logically constructed empiricism, as it is represented by the Vienna Group, prevents the crisis in the mechanistic philosophy from spreading to the scientific world-view as a whole. It shows that the abandonment of mechanistic physics does not imply the need for a return to anthropomorphic physics of the Middle Ages. And right here something has happened which seems rather paradoxical. All those that advocate a return to pre-galilean science, whether it be under the name of 'idealism', 'holism' or 'organicism', or even under the name of 'race' and 'nation', fight with great ardor for the retention of the mechanistic philosophy in the field of physics, and condemn the positivistic physics as an aberration. Evidence for this can be found by just turning the pages of "Journal for General Science" published in Germany since I935. Its aim is the struggle against positivism in science and its</page><page sequence="19">P. Frank 59 method of attack is in opposing 'German' science to 'French nationalism' and 'English empiricism'. In all this, the animistic- authropomorphic philosophy is half-willingly designated as specifically 'German'. A few passages from K. Hillebrand's programmatic article, "Positivisim and Nature", may be cited here. They will make clear how an over estimation of mechanistic physics served in the fight against positivism and in behalf of authropomorphism. Thus it is said: "Mechanism was a planned world picture con- structed upon a principle; positivism accepts without choice every experience into the sum of its experiences. It accepts to be sure mechanistic explanations, as the equivalent of sense per- ceptions, but it denies as a matter of course the significance of every explanation, and gladly disavows them, for its aim is only description.... I therefore ask, isn't the principle advantage of positivism over mechanism tied up with as great a disadvantage? Is it really necessary or even pleasing to exchange a picturable concept of a mechanistic explanation for a pure mathematical formula, which transcends all perception? The break down of mechanism into positivism-very interesting as intellectual history-is an event, it seems to me, that is at present almost everywhere entirely misunderstood. And yet the principles of scientific method will never be determined without its clarifica- tion." And now the author embarks upon an inspired glorification of mechanistic physics. He says: "He who understands the running of a machine say a clock, based on the complete dependence of rigid bodies on spatial con- ceptions, he has genuine satisfying knowledge. It is the mistake of positivism that it is able to take this intention of Democritus as just one among other arbitrary hypotheses. It is also unfor- tunate for the development of positivism that it retains the objec- tivistic bias of mechanism and surrendered its only virtue, its pure, clear Anschaulichkeit." As is almost always the case with those favoring an idealistic- organismic science, the enthusiasm for the mechanistic physics in its most obsolete form is coupled with a strong aversion for the</page><page sequence="20">6o Mechanical vs. Mathematical application of non-euclidean and multi-dimensional spaces. Hillebrand continues: "Mechanism is euclidean science. Relativism of non-euclidean spaces, on the contrary, is the favorite child of positivism-A four dimensional space or a space with curved radii is just as logical for pure abstract thought as the euclidean; indeed the dissolution of space and time into mere abstract mathematical formulae seems to be a distinct gain to this other type of human beings. The overwhelming eternal advantages of euclidean space as over against these abstract arts ought not to be forgotten." The reason for the glorification of 'mechanistic' physics by the advocates of organicism is that for their argument they need the application of a kind of physics that is as narrow as possible and therefore most unsuited for the more involved events. Says Hillebrand: "It is evident from what has been said above that according to our way of thinking mechanism is far superior to positivistic empiricism-so long as it does not attempt to ex- plain living matter. Besides, since Science has abdicated in this respect, there is nothing lost... the value therefore of exact scientific research is not attacked, in so far as it is restricted to 'dead' matter nature. The human mind possesses two sufficient types of knowledge: the explanatory and the understanding. Anschauung in the explanatory sense is the mechanistic explana- tion of nature, the representation of bodily form in an euclidean space-time relation going far beyond positivistic sense perception and yet conceivable or picturable in a narrower sense of sight and taste sensation. The understanding type of knowledge, is 'Anschauung' in a wider sense, perception not as sight sensation, but rather as a palpable human event that need not be 'sensible' but that is directed toward one of the senses." The tendency is very clearly seen to allow mechanistic science to pass as the only 'explanatory' type of knowledge that is use- ful for exact science, so that it might be easier if necessary to introduce the so called 'understanding' type of knowledge in other fields. As opposed to this, the new positivism represents the uniform character of science. It does not care to split human power to</page><page sequence="21">P. Frank 6i know into 'mechanistic-explanatory' and 'understanding-per- ceiving' types. Positivistic logic of science of our time depicts the factual process of successful knowledge and scientific repre- sentation. Mechanistic explanation and understanding-sense- interpretation are accordingly only temporary, and, according to our understanding, more popular and more superficial types of scientific representation, but by no means particularly 'profound' types of knowledge. III. PHYSICS OF THE 20TH CENTURY--THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY The idea that the relativity and quantum theories are not 'Anschaulich' but only 'abstract mathematical' theories rests, above all, on the fact that in these theories are applied multidi- mensional spaces, non-euclidean curved spaces, probability amplitudes, wave functions in multi-dimensional spaces etc. in- stead of perceptible bodies of daily experience represented in three dimensional euclidean space-as was the case in classical physics. As in Part II the word 'Anschaulich' must be given two different meanings: i. 'Anschaulichkeit' of the first principles of the theory. 2. 'Anschaulichkeit' of empirically verifiable conclusions. Anschaulichkeit in the second sense is here too indispensable. Indeed it says in effect: assertions about gross bodies of daily experience must be derived from the theory. But no matter how refined a theory may be, or how complicated its methods of measuring, ultimately something quite gross is observed, the covering of a thread by a line, the similarity of two colored spots, etc. The observed conclusions from a theory are always mecha- nistic in a very tangible sense. They deal with events that can be represented according to the Newtonian mechanics of large bodies. Anschaulichkeit in its first meaning demands that the first principles should be mechanically significant. But then they must assert something direct about the motion of large bodies. The laws of Newtonian mechanics do this, of course. But as we have seen in II, that does not hold any more for Maxwell's theory of the electromagnetic field. What is there mechanically per-</page><page sequence="22">62 Mechanical vs. Mathematical ceptible in the dielectrical disturbance of a vacuum? Often what is pretended as perceptible is an illusion. It is often thought, for example that an electron is perceptible because it is always imagined to be a little body, a corpuscle. But an electron is no body at all in the sense in which this concept is formed from the observations of large bodies described in classical physics. For example, it has no color; it has no definite form under illumi- nation; it hasn't any of the velocity of independent masses. As for the application of multi-dimensional spaces in the physics of the 20th century, the following must be considered: H. Hertz has already stated the first principles of the motion of a system of N points in the form that the representative point of the sys- tem describes a geodetic line. The Liouville proposition of statistical mechanics states that in the 6 N-dimensional phase space, the volume which is filled by the points of state, doesn't change in the course of time. It is said, indeed, that the employ- ment of these spaces was only a form of speech that had no rela- tion to the nature of these theories. But without this manner of speech these propositions would have been rendered clumsy and detailed. In the Newtonian mechanics the expressions 'force' and 'acceleration' are also only forms of speech. But an attempt might be made sometime to express the laws governing planetary motion without the help of these forms of speech. It will soon be observed that they became so detailed, that it will be just as well to say, there are no laws governing these motions. In I905 Einstein had first constructed the special relativity theory without the application of four dimensional space. When, Minkowski introduced these spaces, in I908, the mathematicians were very sympathetic. But to the physicists it appeared as if they had obscured rather than clarified the meaning of the theory. If it is often said that the four-dimensional representation ex- presses the nature of the relativity theory more correctly than the three dimensional one, it is not very aptly stated. It is true that there is something arbitrary in the three dimensional de- scription. A definite relational system must be applied every time. But actually no one of the systems is preferred. Never- theless, if a definite system is applied, something is introduced</page><page sequence="23">P. Frank 63 into the description of nature which corresponds to no observable phenomena. The proposition that only the four dimensional representation describes the nature of the phenomena correctly, is in this sense just as correct as the proposition: Only the Vector representation of the Newtonian equations gives a correct repre- sentation of Newtonian mechanics. In every representation of co6rdinates the direction of the axes is quite arbitrary and the application of the co6rdinates x, y, z introduces something into the phenomena which does not correspond to the observable. But taken logically, the equations in a co6rdinate and vector form express exactly the same thing. Both systems of expression are equipollent and alike in meaning. In Carnap's terminology of the 'logical syntax of language' they may be called L-equipollent since they can only be translated into one another by means of logical transformations. The same holds true for the four-dimensional representation of the relativity theory. With the three dimensional system to which the Lorentz transformations also belong, it is analogous in meaning and interpretation. It is quite correct that Minkowski expressed himself rather un- fortunately in saying that from now on space and time are to be relegated to the empty shadows, and that only some kind of union of the two is to preserve reality. But this is only a pretty and fetching phrase for the mathematical fact that the Lorentz transformations have the form of the rotation of co6rdinates in four-dimensional space, and that the fundamental principles of mechanics and electrodynamics preserve their form in these transformations. But with equal justice it could be said that only the 6 N-dimen- sional phase-space expresses correctly the Liouville proposition. Also it might be said that the 3 N-dimensional configuration space and the 3 N-dimensional impulse-space should be relegated to the empty shadows, and only their comprehensive form, the 6 N- dimensional phase-space, is to preserve reality. What the philosophers say about the significance of the four- dimensional space for the relativity theory often rests on a mis- conception. They mistake lyricism for logic and a pretty phrase</page><page sequence="24">64 Mechanical vs. Mathematical for the discovery of a physical fact. They have said for instance that the relativity theory has 'proven the existence of four-dimen- sional space.' Or if they are not friendly toward Einstein, they said it 'was not proven'. Another inept assertion, found not only in philosophical literature but at times even in physics literature, runs as follows: In the Newtonian mechanics the motion of bodies is represented in euclidean space, and therefore 'Anschau- lich'; in the general relativity theory-in non-euclidean curved space, and therefore 'non-perceptible'. But if the logical struc- ture of the relativity theory is actually analyzed, it will be found that it is nonperceptible in the same sense as the Maxwell Theory of the electro-magnetic field. The fundamental equations them- selves do not represent the motions of large bodies. But in both cases the derived magnitudes can be brought into union with observations of gross mechanical events; and thus observable phe- nomena can be derived from fundamental equations. The value of the rectangular co6rdinates x, y, z, that are ordi- narily employed in classical mechanics can be determined by con- structing rigid measuring scales, that is by means of a simple de- vice that can be described according to the mechanics of large bodies. The co6rdinates X1, X2, X2 , X3 that appear in the general rela- tivity theory represent points in a four-dimensional continuum. Their values, however, can be determined by a simple process of measuring. It is often called a 'Koordinatenmolluske', because the Xi, X2, X3, X4 points are individualized in a continually changing medium without giving any measurable meaning to the values of the co- ordinates or their differences between two points. But the general relativity theory includes a very definite even if somewhat complicated rule with the help of which the co6rdi- nates X1 ... X4, that appear in the equations of motion could be tied up with measureable results. The rules for such measuring processes are not, to be sure, everywhere the same, but depend on the physical conditions of the environment of the doubtful points, particularly on the gravitational field. In other words they depend on whether large bodies are found close by. If we</page><page sequence="25">P. Frank 65 are given two points that are quite close to each other and their coordinate differences are given as dxi, dx2, dx3, dx4, then we will apply the rule with the help of which is established the connection between the numerical values of dxk, which have next to no physi- cal meaning, and the measuring of the distance between the points with the aid of a rigid measuring scale. We will consider perhaps the simple case in which both points are differentiated only by the values of the Xi co6rdinate, so that of dxk only dx1 is different from zero. We then take a very small rigid scale entirely unsupported-hence free in the gravitational field-and we measure with it the distance between any two points that have the co6rdinate differential dxi. We then obtain the equation ds = ydxi in which the factor y may be changed from place to place and time to time, and therefore depends on the co6rdinates Xi... X4. This magnitude which we designate as = /gg11 ggl is one of the ten gravitational potentials. Their differential quotients are connected with the gravitational forces according to the co6rdinates. If the gravitational potential gi, and the other nine potentials g22, g23, . . g44 that are similarly defined, are accepted as function of position, then with a definitely rigid measuring rod or a specially constructed exact clock, the general relation can be determined between the coordinate differen- tials dx. . . dx4, and the spatial or temporal distance between both points. This relation is given by Einstein's theory in the form ds2 = g + 2dxg + gdxl dx*2 + g, dX2 This relation which assigns definite numbers ds to the differential magnitudes of X1... X4 that appear in the field equations, shows that the measuring device depends on the gravitational field, namely on the potentials gil ... g44. But since these potentials, according to the laws of gravitation, are dependent on the masses which generate the field, and since these gravitational laws were also constructed by Einstein in his general relativity theory, we may say that by measuring the masses generated in the field, we could construct the measuring devices by means of which definite numbers with physical significance can be assigned to the arbi-</page><page sequence="26">66 Mechanical vs. Mathematical trary coordinates Xi... X4 which determine only the relative place on the "mollusk". Exactly as the equations of the ordinary theory of the electro- magnetic field state the rules by means of which unintinted mag- nitudes can be measured according to their numerical value, such as the di-electrical displacement of a vacuum, similarly there reside in the Einstein equations of the gravitational field tied with the measuring methods, the devices for assigning numbers having a unique meaning to the unintintable coordinates of the 'mollusk system' and the gravitational potentials gll... g44. Every statement about the position of mass points, expressed in the 'mollusk'-co6rdinates, Xi, X2, X3, X4, is absolutely equal in content (in the sense of Carnap's syntax, P-equipollent) to a statement about the results of measurements of large bodies. But it is not equal in sense perception because physical laws must also be employed to establish the relation. The application of curved spaces is nothing else than the use of such mollusk-co6rdinates about which it is no longer presumed that they stand in so simple a relation to the measurable estimates in rigid measuring scales, as was the case in classical mechanics and the euclidian measuring systems. But the difference between the "physically intuitable" and the "mathematically abstract is not greater than in the classical theory of the electro-magnetic field despite the "curved" spaces in the Einstein gravitational theory. For one who has only studied Euclidean geometry the application of curved spaces may well be amazing; but from the point of view of scientific logic, it does not follow that the structure of the physical theory is changed. The general relativity theory is precisely as much and as little "mathematical" and precisely as much and as little "anschaulich" as the Maxwell field theory. But after all is said, one thing is clear: if the laws concerning the swift motion of the atoms do not agree with those concerning the slow motion of large bodies, then they too can not be "mechan- ically-perceptible" in the old sense of the words. For to be "mechanically perceptible" means to be explainable in terms of the motion of large bodies, i.e. in terms of Newtonian equations of motion.</page><page sequence="27">P. Frank 67 IV. PHYSICS OF THE 20TH CENTURY: THE QUANTUM THEORY If it is said that the quantum theory is still less 'anschaulich' than the general relativity theory, then it can only mean that its propositions deviate even more from those made by Newtonian mechanics about the motion of large bodies. Fundamentally, the logical structure of quantum mechanics cannot be any other than that of Maxwell's electromagnetic field theory. Its equations must represent relations between magni- tudes, which can only be stated in estimates measured by rough mechanical devices. In order to comprehend it in detail, it is only necessary to analyze one case in which the quantum theory makes presumptions that are experimentally verifiable. Let us consider electron diffraction flexion. Perhaps the sim- plest case-for esample-electron rays, from a cathode tube, are allowed to fall on a metal plate, and one observes the influence of the reflected rays on a photographic plate put in their path. It is noticed that the rays are reflected in accordance with the ordinary law of reflection; but only those rays are actually reflected that fall within definite angles, and only these rays produce a photo- chemical effect on the photographic plate, i.e. produces a blacken- ing on the paper. These angles p satisfy the equation D. sin sp = nX, in which n represents any integer, D, any distance between two molecules in the metal plate and X a constant, composed of mass m, velocity v and Planck's quantum of action h in the form X = ho This result can be derived theoretically, provided the mv space, in which radiation and photochemical effect proceed, is described by a place function-the Schr6dinger "wave function". The assignment of its values at a point x, y, z, to measurable results is effected by means of the following relations: If a photo- graphic plate is found in a place in space, then (2)2 i.e. the square of the absolute value of the wave function so, is proportional to the intensity of the photochemical effect or the blackening of the paper. But if in a place of this space a Geiger point counter is set up, then it will produce electroscopic pulses that are connected with it, and the number of which in the unit of time is also proportional to the value of (o) 2. A closer prediction within how short a time</page><page sequence="28">68 Mechanical vs. Mathematical these pulses would start, cannot be made from the knowledge of p, but from the knowledge of a statistical average. There is therefore, an assignment of value of magnitude (p for wholly grossly observ- able events, such as the blackening of photographic papers and electroscopic pulses, that do not differ in the least from events observed in experiments of classical physics. In the case of the blackening the value of sp is assigned to the result of a pauschal observation of the intensity of the blackening; with the point-counter it is given an average value obtained from many individual observations. The physical laws of the quan- tum theory consist, therefore, of relations between values of the kind described. Relationships of this sort are known to classical physics. The Einstein law of the Brownian movement also predicts average values within a time-interval. If we examine very many small particles and measure each time the distance S which the particles cover in the time 9' then the median value of all squares, S2, comes to the sum total of 2Dt, where D represents the diffusion constant. Also "in a purely causal event", as in a freely falling body where the distance S traversed in the time t is represented by the equation S = - t2, the formula can only be verified by the average value taken from many observations of the distance S in the time t. "Observational errors" are taken for granted. But this is reconstruction of the event. The test of a formula is always obtained from an average value gotten from many individ- ual observations. In the axiomatic construction of the quantum theory the rela- tion between determinism and statistics plays a part entirely different from that in classical physics. According to the latter it should be possible to reduce the scattering of values of an obser- vation, with the refinement of the experimental method, whereas according to present day physics, the scatterings of various ob- servable magnitudes are so tied up with one another that not all can be made as small as one likes at the same time. But in the verification of a concrete relation between observable magnitudes this difference hardly matters. Now as before, the problem is in verifying a relation between averages.</page><page sequence="29">P. Frank 69 V. NATURE AND PURE MATHEMATICS The proposition that nature is subject to the laws of "pure mathematics" can be given two interpretations: I) The propositions of pure mathematics are confirmed by the experimental results of science. This assertion is meaningless. For the propositions of pure mathematics are pure, logical proposi- tions. They are concerned therefore with what is said about the world and not at all with what happens in the world. The propositions of pure mathematics are, as it is also expressed, tau- tological, analytical, formal propositions. In any case, whatever may happen in nature, or whatever the results of the experiments may be, the propositions of pure mathematics remain unaltered. They are concerned with the description of events in various equivalent forms,-if we wish to express it this way. These diverse formulations of the same situation can be translated into one another whatever the observed events happen to be. 2) But the question whether nature can be interpreted in terms of pure mathematics can be understood in a different sense. In the physical theories of today, there are very often employed complicated mathematical concepts as the Riemannian curva- ture-tensor, infinite matrices, Hermite forms, etc. These con- cepts originated from considerations of pure mathematics, and only afterward became applicable to physical theories, such as the general relativity and quantum theories, that had not yet been discovered when these concepts were formulated. Therefore, the world must be construed in its physical events too in terms of the laws of pure mathematics. For the concepts, created by the "pure" mathematicians without any knowledge of the physical laws have proved particularly fit for the formulation of these physical laws. In his observations, Jeans draws an essential distinction be- tween "pure" and "applied" mathematics. The applied mathe- matician, the engineer, for example, creates his mathematical con- cepts for the purpose of controlling concrete situations with their aid, say, in machines. But the fact that the world takes its course according to the formulas of "applied mathematics" is no proof of its mathematical construction. For these formulas are created</page><page sequence="30">70 Mechanical vs. Mathematical for the purpose of representing natural events. Pure mathemat- ics, on the other hand, creates its concepts out of its own nature, from the instinct of play as it were. And now it seems that these concepts of pure mathematics can also be applied advantageously to physics. Thus the general relativity theory can hardly be imagined with- out the aid of the concepts of the differential calculus of Ricci and Levi-Civita, or without the basic geometrical concepts of the Riemannian space theory. Quantum mechanics can hardly dis- pense with the Hamilton-Jacoby theory of contact transforma- tions, and the transformations of the Hermite forms, etc. But all these concepts were created by "pure" mathematicians out of necessity. If they now prove to be useful, indeed indispensable to physics, then it is evident, according to Jeans, that nature is modeled after the ideas of a "pure" mathematician. If a sound judgment about such ideas is really desired, it is necessary to consider very carefully how the mathematical con- cepts mentioned actually originated. Let us begin therefore with a very simple example. Galileo described the motion of a freely falling body by asserting that the "acceleration" is constant. He created the concept of accelera- tion for the representation of this form of motion. But when Newton generalized Galileo's laws so as to include other types of motion it appeared that the generalization was possible, if, in describing important motions in nature, acceleration was no longer considered a constant, but rather dependent in a simple way on the position of the body in motion in relation to other bodies. The most important example of this is Newton's dis- covery that centripetal acceleration of the moon in its course around the earth is inversely proportional to the square of its distance. It might also be said: it is remarkable that with the help of the concept of acceleration, which is the second differential quotient of the distances according to time, that is, a concept of "pure mathematics," it is possible to describe so well the movement of the planets. But it is very clearly seen in this example that accel- eration has already been introduced to describe a known class of</page><page sequence="31">P. Frank 71 natural events, namely Galileo's motions of falling bodies. In Jeans' sense, therefore, it is, to be sure, a concept of "applied" mathematics. But it appeared that it plays a part even in more general events than in motions for the benefit of which it was introduced. Yet, it does not play a very important part. In Einstein's general gravitational theory, that is, in very fast motion in very strong gravitational fields, acceleration is no longer as important as it was in Newtonian mechanics. Here new mathematical con- cepts had to be employed. "Potential" was introduced to describe the electrostatic field, that is, forces proceeding from masses at rest. It satisfied the Laplace equation or the condition for the disappearance of the curl of the electrical field of force. But if we have the field of electrical currents or other magnetic fields, then the curl of elec- trical field-strength does not disappear any more as in the case of the electrostatic field. But Maxwell has shown that the mathe- matical method discovered for the description of the electrostatic field, that is, the concept of the "curl" and that of the "Laplace operator" can also be applied to the description of more general fields. Only the curl is now no longer zero, but proportional to the variation in the magnetic field strength. Also the La-place expression of potential, instead of disappearing in the general field, is bound up with the temporal variation of potential by the wave equation. Maxwell himself clearly formulated this connection between mathematical method and physical theory. (See our citation from Maxwell's works.) The general plan connecting existing mathematical concepts with new physical theories is always in the examples cited from the classical physics, the following: I) A mathematical concept is constructed well adapted to a simple description of an already known physical fact. Example: Acceleration, curl of a vector field. With the help of these con- cepts the fact derived from it can be simply expressed: Constant of acceleration, disappearance of the curl. 2) The discovered mathematical concepts employed in the description of simple facts, often serve in the lucid description of</page><page sequence="32">72 Mechanical vs. Mathematical a more general class of natural events. 'Acceleration' helps in the construction of general Newtonian equations of motion; the curl of the field of force is very important in the Maxwell equa- tions for general electromagnetic fields. At times the known facts may be simply described by different mathematical concepts. But then not all of them are equally adapted for generalization. That system of concepts which is best adapted for the generalization of a large field of facts, is often spoken of as the 'most adequate representation' of the 'essence of the fact'. Precisely the same considerations can be applied to the develop- ment of the relativity theory. Minkowski described very neatly Einstein's special relativity theory by demonstrating the sym- metrical nature of the equations in space and time. The physical content of the theory was not in the least changed by this four dimensional mathematical representation. It was only, as some said, a 'formal game'. Many physicists at once thought that the meaning of the theory was obscured by such formalistic sleight- of-hand, or in any case made more difficult to understand. But Minkowski himself found, with the aid of his representation, the field equations for electromagnetic events within moving bodies of any di-electrical constant and magnetization number. As a re- sult the mathematical concepts he created for representation of events in empty space proved to be of great help for the more general events in any bodies. But Einstein himself soon departed from the Minkowski form of the special relativity theory. He generalized it further by in- troducing the absolute differential calculus of Ricci and Levi- Civita, thus creating the mathematical basis for the representa- tion of his general relativity theory. This generalization would hardly have been possible without the Minkowski four-dimen- sional representation of the special relativity theory. Its original three dimensional form would not have been appropriate for gen- eralizing about motions that are not uniform and in a straight line. For it is in the four-dimensional curved space that the basic concept of a geodetic line is to be found. Such a concept could not be derived from the description of uniform motion in a straight line in a three-dimensional space.</page><page sequence="33">P. Frank 73 In any case the mathematical concepts necessary for this par- ticular generalization were developed as stated in two stages. The concepts served as a point of departure for the description of motions of any deformable body, that is, general curvilinear co- ordinates. To find a junction to the customary system of measur- ing which makes use of rigid bodies, Einstein had to have the mathematical concepts for expressing the motion of rigid bodies in terms of motions of deformable bodies in curvilinear co6rdinates. It is well known that Einstein looked for such mathematical ex- pressions. In his conversations with his mathematical colleagues, G. Pick in Prague and M. Grossmann in Zurich he soon found that the mathematicians had already developed such a system of con- cepts in the theory of transformation groups and their invariants (i.e. expressions that do not change while moving). In this man- ner Einstein was led to investigate the general differential calcu- lus of Ricci and Levi-Civita, which was a very appropriate mathe- matical method for a very neat representation of the ideas of Helmholtz, Riemann and Christoffel. These ideas aimed to represent the motion of a rigid body with the help of curvilinear co6rdinates. The problem to be solved was: which variation expressed in curvilinear co6rdinates is the motion of a rigid body? Riemann and Christoffel answered this question in the form that certain expressions formed from the deformations must vanish in order to represent the motion of a rigid body. These expressions, which according to modern mathematical terminology form the com- ponents of a tensor (the Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor) are the simplest mathematical elements for the investigation of physical processes in curvilinear co6rdinates, just as the ordinary curvature of a curve is the simplest element for the description of motion in curvilinear co6rdinates. For the simplest, force-free motion the curvature disappears and every effect of a force can be described most simply as an effect on the curvature. According to the fundamental assumptions which led Einstein to his general theory of relativity, there could be no rigid bodies. He could not present the theory by means of orthogonal Cartesian co6rdinates. He had to turn to curvilinear co6rdinates. Since,</page><page sequence="34">74 Mechanical vs. Mathematical however, according to the Einstein postulates, bodies in a space free of masses, i.e. without a gravitational field, behave like rigid Euclidean bodies, he could look upon the deviation of bodies from the properties of rigid bodies as the effect of a gravitational field. Then he represented their deformation in curvilinear co6rdinates. The components of the Riemann-Christoffel tensor could be used as a measure of the deviation of a given deformation from the motion of a rigid body, just as the curvature of a path is a measure of deviation from straight-line motion. Hence Einstein formulated his new laws for the gravitational field by setting the components of this tensor to something differ- ent from zero and dependent on the surrounding gravitating masses. So arose the Einstein field equations of gravitation. The logical structure of the march of his thought therefor was quite similar to that which led from Galilei to Newton. Again: first, the creation of mathematical concepts,-then, 'acceleration', now, the Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor; second, the for- mulation of a description of a larger realm of facts with the help of these concepts,-then, transition from the constant gravita- tional field of a free fall to the general gravitational field of New- ton, now, the transition from a vanishing gravitational field with a vanishing curvature tensor to any strong field with a curvature tensor depending on the distribution of masses.
