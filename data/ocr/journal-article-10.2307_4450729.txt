<plain_text><page sequence="1">Biology Today Gone Buggy Maura C. Flannery Department Editor Bill Logan is a sculptor and a fly- fisher. He has managed to combine these interests in the creation of extremely realistic lures: insect repro- ductions that are accurate down to the hairs on the flies' legs. It takes him weeks to complete a single specimen, and for each fly he creates, he keeps meticulous notes and sketches that can run to more than 90 pages (Revkin 1998). Logan has just begun to use magnifying lenses, so he now aspires to a whole new level of detail. Need- less to say, with a price tag of about $4,000, one of his insects is a work of art, not technology. Another artist interested in insects has taken an oppo- site tack. Alexis Rockman (1996) strives for realism, but on a different scale; he creates large paintings with insects that may be a foot or more long. This is very disorienting and emphasizes how alien insects seem to be (Quam- men 1997). Rockman almost makes them into creatures from a science fiction movie. Despite their different approaches, Logan and Rockman have something in common. They both force viewers to pay attention to insects, to look at them closely: Logan by getting observers to squint and Rockman by making attention unavoidable-his insects are just too big not to look at. A Love-Hate Relationship Paying attention to insects is a good thing; after all, they represent about Maura C. Flannery is Professor of Biol- ogy and Assistant Director of the Cen- ter for Teaching and Learning at St. John's University, Jamaica, NY 11439. She earned a B.S. in biology from Mary- mount Manhattan College; an M.S., also in biology, from Boston College; and a Ph.D. in science education from New York University. Her major interests are in communicating sci- ence to the nonscientist and in the relationship between biology and art. 60% of known species (Wilson 1992), and insects are fascinating, despite the fact that most people don't really want to think about them. Sue Hubbell (1993) cites a survey in which fewer than 1% of the respondents liked insects, and 90% either disliked or were "acutely afraid" of them (p. 158). As a biologist, I should put myself at least with the 9% who have somewhat positive attitudes towards these crea- tures, but I can't. I don't like insects and will admit to being on a crusade to keep my home insect-free, not with toxic chemicals but with brut force: if I see them, I squish them. But while I don't crave personal contact with these beasts, I can't help but be fasci- nated by them-almost despite myself. I think this love-hate relationship with insects is common, though most people don't seem to want to admit any affection for these creatures. The entomologist May Berenbaum of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Cham- paign runs an annual Insect Fear Film Festival; she highlights films, espe- cially of the science fiction genre, that play on people's fear and loathing of the six-legged. But last year, two of the most popular films in movie houses nationwide, Antz and A Bug's Life, presented very "sympathetic" views of these organisms, and this is hardly a new phenomenon. There is a 1942 cartoon called "Mr. Bug Goes to Town" that deals with insects living near Broadway and wearing very flashy striped clothes. And while many women, myself included, would scream if they found a large insect crawling on their shoulder, many will spend a fortune for brooches of gold, silver and jewels in the likeness of flies, bees, beetles, or other forms of what my mother would call "creepy crawlies." There also seems to be an interior decorating fad right now for old zoological illustrations of insects and for collections of insects in glass display cases and frames. Doug Taylor of Praiseworthy Antiques in Manhat- tan goes so far as to say that "bugs are so flamboyant, they appeal to everyone" (Moonan 1998, p. E38). He adds that a "good bug box" costs from $50 to $500. I'm not sure just what all this means, but I think it's important for biology teachers to try to encourage the love part of this love-hate relation- ship. Hubbell quotes Paul Olper, an American lepidopterist, as saying that in Britain, insects are studied because the habitats of larger, showy animals have long since been destroyed and the animals themselves are gone. Insects, of course, are still around. This dearth of other organisms is unfortu- nately the case in much of this country as well; so maybe it's time to appreci- ate six-legged creatures a little more. I've been on spring break this week, and I've spent part of it reading about insects. I have to admit that I've had a wonderful time, that I've really enjoyed myself-almost despite myself. I've reread a few classic works on insects and also looked at some of the latest research, and in this column, I want to discuss both. Two Novels I wrote about insects in ABT a long time ago (Flannery 1985), but my pres- ent burst of interest is due to a friend, an English professor named Faith Wat- son, who got me to read A.S. Byatt's (1993) novel, Angels and Insects. I had read Byatt's Babel Tower (1996), which I had not particularly liked, so I would never have picked up another of her books if it weren't for Faith, who was using Angels and Insects in one of the courses she teaches. It is composed of two novellas, both of which are wonderful, but it is Morpho Eugenia, BIOLOGY TODAY 461</page><page sequence="2">the one that deals with insects, that I'm interested in here. It's about the Alabasters, an upper-class British fam- ily in the days shortly after the publica- tion of Darwin's On the Origin of Spe- cies. A young naturalist, William Adamson, fresh from an expedition to South America, comes to stay with the Alabasters in order to organize a large collection of specimens, many of which Adamson himself sent back to Lionel Alabaster, his patron. The story is essentially a romance-with a twist. I don't want to say too much because it is a story definitely worth reading, specially for biologists, and I don't want to spoil it for you. But I will say that it is about butterflies, insect colonies, writing science for nonscien- tists, the lure of travel, the problems for many in accepting Darwin's ideas, and natural history as edifying-a popular 19th-century idea. Faith-a very biology-minded English professor-also told me about another novel, Still Life with Insects by Brian Kiteley (1989). It's the life story of Elwyn Farmer, an entomologist, told in a series of vignettes, each of which begins with an entry about an insect specimen Farmer has collected. He spends his life working for flour pro- ducers where his entomological knowledge comes in handy, though he never manages to finish his Ph.D. nor to rise very high on the corporate ladder. His love of insects helps him to keep sane and to deal with the travails and sorrows of his life. It is a spare little book and while you won't learn much entomology from it, I think it is a book that biologists, especially those interested in insects, would find particularly appealing. Kiteley shows how intimately life and science can be intertwined. Dung Beetles-Old &amp; New These novels got me thinking about insects, despite my desire to ignore them, and they brought to mind other insect-related reading material that I've enjoyed. While I don't want them crawling all over me, I have to admit that I do enjoy reading about insects, though I'm not sure why. Part of it may be that, because they are so small, their behavior can often be studied up close and so writers can provide a lot of detail. I especially have in mind the writings of the 19th-century French entomologist Henry Fabre, who paint- ed superb word pictures of the activi- ties of the great number of insect species he painstakingly studied. In a collection of Fabre's essays edited by Edwin Way Teale (1949), two in particular have stuck in my mind. "The Sacred Beetle" is about dung bee- tles, and Fabre describes a field where "Sheep are grazing and Horses being exercised for the approaching races, while all are distributing manna to the enraptured Dung-beetles" (p. 94). Describing dung beetles as enraptured and other even more blatant cases of anthropomorphism may not be to the tastes of many biologists, but I think Fabre can be forgiven for a style that was designed to appeal to his lay audi- ence because he provides so much accurate and specific information. He even records the results of simple experiments he carried out, such as seeing how a dung beetle reacts when he pins its ball of dung to the ground so it can't be moved: the beetle uses its back as a wedge and a lever and pushes with its feet. The images in an essay on caterpillars are just as memorable; even students who were disgusted by "The Pine Processionary" admit that they will not forget it. It's about pine caterpillars. As each moves out from the nest, it follows the silk trail laid down by the caterpillar ahead of it. The caterpillar column just reverses direction when it heads back to the nest at the end of a night of feeding. In one of his experiments, Fabre laid down a silk trail around the circumference of a cylindrical vase and then placed caterpillars on the trail. They kept moving around and around the cylinder day after day, even when bits of much-needed food were placed close enough for them to detect. Noth- ing would reflect them from their path until they dropped off the vase, exhausted and weakened by starvation. Fabre's ability to write engagingly about insects is shared by a number of present-day writers. Natalie Angier, a science writer for The New York Times, has a couple of very good essays about insects in her book, The Beauty of the Beastly (1995), which sports a cock- roach on the cover. One of the two insect pieces is on roaches, and Angier laments that new and more effective insecticides make it less likely that many city dwellers will have the chance to do cockroach behavior stud- ies when they turn on the lights in their kitchens at night. I'm not quite so heartbroken-or so convinced that cockroaches are that hard to come by. But Angier does make a good case on their behalf, describing, for example, the females of the cockroach species Diploptera punctata that carry their embryos and nourish them with a milky substance secreted by the uterus, and the hissing roach that makes a "good pet" because "it's covered with an armorlike cuticle and thus is appeal- ing to hold and stroke" (p. 119). To each his own. Angier also writes lov- ingly of dung beetles, in essence updating Fabre's essay and arguing for the ecological importance of these insects in dealing with animal waste. Sue Hubbell Right now, my favorite writer on insects is Sue Hubbell, a beekeeper who couldn't confine her interest to these insects, and has written about representatives of a number of others in Broadsides from the Other Orders: A Book of Bugs (1993). Hubbell is not a scientist, but a writer who specializes in natural history topics, and this may be in her favor. I reread her book this week, and then reread the entomolo- gist Howard Ensign Evans' (1968) Life on a Little-Known Planet, a book I've read and enjoyed a couple of times. But this time, after having just finished Broadsides, Evans' book seemed too fact-filled and reminded me of the criticism often leveled against scien- tists who try to write for the public: they just try to pack in too many facts and concepts. I'm not denigrating Evans' book because there is a great deal there, and it is all presented well-interestingly and clearly-but I think there may be more here than most people would want to know about fireflies and crickets and para- sitic wasps, the latter being Evans' research speciality. Evans' later book, The Pleasures of Entomology: Portraits of Insects and the People Who Study Them (1985), is less detailed, but I still think Hubbell's book is more accessible. She, too, writes about the biologists who do research on insects as well as on the insects themselves, but she has the interested layperson's knack of provid- ing just the most relevant and interest- ing information. 462 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, VOLUME 61, NO. 6, JUNE 1999</page><page sequence="3">Hubbell notes that many of her insect investigations began with ques- tions posed by relatives and friends: her son asking what she knew about black flies as he was being eaten alive by them in Maine; her husband won- dering what clouds of gnats "were up to." For many years, Hubbell supple- mented her income as a writer with a thriving business in honey so she has more knowledge of bees than of any other insect order, but she has already written a book on bees (1989), so she limits herself here to one chap- ter-on "killer" bees-and it is one of the most sensible pieces I've read on these insects. She takes a wait-and- see attitude, but sees the evidence as indicating that they are not nearly as dangerous or as unproductive as advertised. Hubbell also writes of sil- verfish, katydids, and black flies, but my favorite chapter is the last, on camel crickets. Early in this chapter she writes that "when I drive back and forth between the Ozarks (where her bees are) and Washington (where her husband works) I am accompanied by two dogs, one cat, and camel crickets of varying number, egg to adult" (p. 218). It turns out that with all her research on insects, Hubbell has developed a spe- cial affection for these flightless crea- tures which are not terribly obvious. They are nocturnal and live on dead material so they don't cause crop dam- age or otherwise make nuisances of themselves. In the camel cricket Hub- bell has found an organism that she wants to know more about to the point that she is willing to do research on it. The 20th-century's greatest expert on camel crickets was also named Hubbell: Theodore Hubbell who taught at the University of Michigan and who in 1936 published the stan- dard work on the most common genus of camel crickets in North America, the Ceuthophilus. Theodore Hubbell is no relation to Sue Hubbell's ex-hus- band, but somehow the name made her feel connected to this biologist who died in the 1980s. A student of his, Ted Cohn, is working with Sue Hubbell on one of the many unknowns concerning camel crickets. In the part of the Ozarks just south of where she lives, the males of the species C. seclusus have a different form from those in her area, and Ted Cohn is interested in this difference: whether females in her area mate only with the males found there, or if they accept the other form. So Hubbell happily ends her book with the remark that as she picks up her crickets for another trip to Washington she thinks that they will probably be her companions for years to come, as she seeks to learn more and more about them. Insect Comparisons Since I want to mention some of the new research on insects, I don't have time to get into a discussion of other good writing on these creatures, except to mention one more book and an odd essay that I can't leave out. The book is hardly new, it's Niko Tinbergen's (1958) Curious Naturalists. Tinbergen won the Nobel Prize for his work in animal behavior, and this book is a memoir in which he recounts some of his research projects. He did a number of studies on birds, but there are also several chapters on insects; my favorite is the opening chapter describing the early studies he did on Dedicated to Educational Excellence forMore Than 40 Years Faculty Consultants for the Advanced Placement Reading Next June more than 4,000 college faculty and Advanced Placement teachers will gather for one week to evaluate and score students' essays at the annual AP Reading.

BIOLOGY TODAY 463</page><page sequence="4">digger wasps. The essay I want to mention is by a Czech biologist who died recently. Miroslav Holub. He was an immunologist-and also a noted poet-who wrote rather quirky essays on a wide variety of topics and always with an original point of view. This is certainly the case with "Visible Microbes" in which he compares insects to bacteria: If the microbes' salami-like or doughnut- shaped bodies, with their fimbria, cilia or flagella, could be measured in centi- meters instead of microns and could walk around a table, following some chemotactic stimuli, the effect would be conspicuously similar to the passage of the Gypsy Moth caterpillars (1990, p. 82). Holub also sees similarities between the reproductive capacities of bacteria and queen ants, and he writes of a "systemic infection" of goat moths that resulted from his keeping goat moth caterpillars in his rented room when he was a student. It's hard to look at either bacteria or insects in quite the same way after reading this essay. In a commentary on recent research on ants' cultivation of fungi, Jared Dia- mond (1998) also makes an interesting comparison: between ant farmers and human farmers. He notes that ant spe- cies growing fungi in their nests share many agricultural practices with humans: they eliminate competing weeds, use manure to stimulate fungal growth, and apply "antibiotic herbi- cides so as to maintain a monoculture of the desired crop" (p. 1974). But there are differences as well; ants propagate fungi vegetatively as clones, while most crops cultivated by humans are grown from seed. Diamond is com- menting on a genetic study into the relationships between fungi grown by different ant species. The molecular evidence shows that the ant fungi belong to five different clades, indicat- ing that there were at least five inde- pendent domestication events. But almost all of the ant fungal crops belong to a single tribe, the Leucoco- prini, suggesting that these species are particularly adaptable to ant agricul- tural practices. Two of the ant crops were identical to wild mushrooms which probably means that there are still ongoing domestications of wild fungi. So Many Beetles Another genetic study helps to answer an old puzzle in biology: just why are there so many beetles-more than 330,000 identified species in the beetles' order, the Coleoptera. Biolo- gists have long looked for a solution more satisfying than J.B.S. Haldane's supposed answer that the Creator has an inordinate fondness for beetles. In 1964, Paul Ehrlich and Peter Raven hypothesized that plant and insect evo- lution were tied together, but five years ago, Conrad Labandeira found that the appearance of angiosperms had no effect on the number of insect families (Morell, 1998). Now Brian Far- rell (1998) of Harvard University has looked more closely at beetle taxon- omy, studying the subfamily rather than the family level. He analyzed DNA from 115 species of the herbivo- rous beetle subfamilies, sampling up to six species from each. He then coor- dinated this genetic data with informa- tion on fossils, dietary habits, and biogeography. The results indicate a close relationship between plant and beetle diversity. Two related super- families of herbivorous beetles, the Chrysomeloidea and the Curculio- noidea, have become particularly diverse, with their species making up 80% of all herbivorous beetles and almost half of all herbivorous insects. What makes the plant-beetle link par- ticularly convincing is that the rise in diversity in these superfamilies coin- cides with the rise of the angiosperms: well over 100,000 new beetle species arose as the angiosperms became common. Because there are so many beetle species to choose from, it's not surpris- ing that they're the focus of a great deal of research, including that of some of the stars of entomology, including Thomas Eisner of Cornell University. He worked with chemists on an analy- sis of the substances exuded by the pupa of the squash beetle. The researchers found that this beetle is capable of rather sophisticated combi- natorial chemistry, a concept that is very popular with human chemists right now (Schroder et al. 1998). Com- binatorial chemistry means taking a limited number of small building blocks and creating a large number of different chemicals by combining the subunits in many different ways. In the case of a linear molecule, for example, three different building blocks can be combined to yield nine different molecules. If the variety of subunits is increased or the size of the product molecule enlarged, then the number of possible products increases tre- mendously. Researchers are using combinatorial chemistry to quickly synthesize large collections of different molecules for drug screening pro- grams, for example, but it turns out that squash beetles have been using the technique a lot longer. Squash beetle pupae release a cocktail containing hundreds of different compounds, all assembled from the same set of basic chemical building blocks. Even after droplets have been secreted from glan- dular hairs, chemical change contin- ues. By analyzing secretions of pupae of different ages, researchers found that, over time, isomerization occurs to form compounds with the same molecular formulas but different struc- tures, making the chemical mix even more diverse. Dung Beetles, Again Fred Nijhout, a noted develop- mental biologist at Duke University, is working with one of Natalie Angier's favorite beasts: the dung beetle. In research with Douglas Emlen of the University of Montana, Nijhout finds that dung beetles which grow larger horns have smaller eyes, and beetles with smaller horns have larger eyes (Yoon 1998). This study suggests that there are architectural limitations to possible morphologies and that these constraints may be caused by competi- tion among growing body parts. It seems that limited resources during development mean that not every pos- sible combination of characteristics is possible; for example, in this case it's not possible to have a dung beetle with both large horns and large eyes. This is probably not a phenomenon peculiar to beetles because Emlen and Nijhout find a similar situation in but- terflies. Working with caterpillars of buckeye butterflies, they removed the imaginal disks that would have devel- oped into the hind wings. The result- ing adult butterflies have, as expected, no hind wings, and more importantly, the fore wings are enlarged. While this study is interesting, it's difficult to know how widespread this phenome- 464 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, VOLUME 61, NO. 6, JUNE 1999</page><page sequence="5">non might be; it may only relate to insect development. But in any case, it indicates that developmental compe- tition of body parts may be one expla- nation for why certain possible animal forms have never been found, in addi- tion to the evolutionary explanation that such forms were not adaptively advantageous. Though there are a large number of other studies I could cite, I've run out of space. So I'll close by mention- ing some insects I came across in a rather unusual place-in I.D., the international design magazine. Its Sep- tember/October 1997 edition was called "Infestation: The Bug Issue," and it was just that. Insects were treated as intriguing solutions to design problems. Real insects were presented in the form of gorgeously colored, scanning electron microscope images with an accompanying text written by Thomas Eisner. There were also articles on Volkswagens beetles (old and new), tiny insect-like robots, and even the problems of "bugs" plant- ed for surveillance. All this seems to prove that you can't avoid bugs-they just come in too many different forms. References Angier, N. (1995). The Beauty of the Beastly: New Views of the Nature of Life.
