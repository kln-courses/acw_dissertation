<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXECUTION OF JUDGMENTS AGAINST THE PROPERTY OF FOREIGN STATES.- Dicta of an earlier date fostered the principle that municipal courts were never competent to entertain actions against foreign states I unless there had been submission to the jurisdiction 2 or unless suits were brought in regard to immovables in the state of the forum.3 The com- plexity of new situations and the fertility of theorists have encum- bered the fundamental doctrine with other exceptions. From Italy has come the theory that immunity extends only to acts jure imperii and not to acts jure gestionis.4 Now the French courts, contrary to a long line of cases, have apparently accepted the distinction; 5 it has long 1 Schooner Exchange v.

Admittedly, its property may in some in- stances be subjected to process. When it appears as plaintiff it may be required to give security for costs; 15 and though definitive decisions are few, it may be taken as established that orders of a court are en- forceable against immovable property of a foreign state in suits concern- ing this property.16 And if the principle of immunity is so far trans- gressed as to allow suits against a state when it engages in private enterprise abroad,17 the property or funds used in this enterprise should perhaps be subject to process.'8 Here the possible difficulty of distin- guishing these funds from the general property of the state must not be overlooked. And it would seem unwarranted to subject to execution the property used in the enterprise if the judgment itself was rendered in a suit arising out of activity concededly immune. Where tahe foreign state has submitted to the jurisdiction merely for the single suit, the principle of immunity from execution is difficult to challenge. In these situations it is almost everywhere agreed that judg- ment may be obtained; 19 it may be for costs,20 or, in some courts, for an affirmative counterclaim where the state has impliedly submitted to the jurisdiction by bringing suit.21 But the few cases which directly favor of the plaintiff on the counterclaim was reversed. 20 F.(2d) 307 (C. C. A. 2d, I927), certiorari denied, 275 U. S. 497 (1928). Subsequently the parties stipulated that the plaintiff was not a state-owned corporation but an agency of the govern- ment of Sweden, and a judgment vacating an order of attachment and writ of execution was affirmed.

Much stress is laid on cases where attachments and orders of execution against property of foreign states were dissolved, but which really express the proposition that the domestic courts were in any case incompetent to entertain suit.24 Again, misleading analogies are drawn from municipal law, ig- noring the fact that the general immunity of the state from execution at the hands of its own courts rests upon considerations quite different from those which should determine the immunity of foreign states.25 But the case for the denial of immunity from execution is too often based on considerations equally vulnerable.

It must be sought in the political exigencies of international life and in the practical con- sequences of exercising upon foreign states the compulsion to which private individuals are subjected. Granted such premises, the dis- turbance of international relations which would follow from the execu- tion of judgments against the property of foreign states in this class of cases should outweigh the consideration due to private litigants. Some protection to the interests of the latter would be secured by virtue of the state's desire to maintain its credit, coupled with its moral obligation to satisfy a judgment against it. 26 This argument is advanced by LOENI-NG, op. cit. supra note 2I, at 92, I3I, and by TUYRK, ZWANGSVOLLSTRECKUNG GFGEN AUSLANDSSTAATEN (I9I2) 50. 27 The dictum of Taney, C. J., in Gordon v. United States, II7 U. S. 697, 702 (i864), has lost much of its force in consequence of Tutun v. United States, 270 U. S. 568 (I925), and Fidelity Nat. Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Swope, 274 U. S. I23 (I926). In the Hellfeld case, supra note 22, the Prussian Gerichtshof zur Ent- scheidung der Kompetenzenkonflikte held that execution was not an essential part of the judicial process. See also S. A. des chemins de fer Liegeois-Luxembourgeois v. gttat neerlandais, supra note 6. Clearly it is futile to contend that if execution is essential to judicial power then execution against a foreign state must be permissible if judgment is given. When a positive rule of international law prevents execution, the extent of the judicial power is irrelevant. It would be of importance only in the United States in con- nection with the jurisdiction of the federal courts over cases and controversies. The Tutun and Swope cases, supra, would seem to settle this question in the affirmative. 28 Since jurisdiction over states engaging in private enterprises is generally based on submission to the jurisdiction and results in placing the foreign state on a footing of equality with private persons, it would carry with it submission of the assets engaged in the enterprise to execution.
