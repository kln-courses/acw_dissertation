      <p>This volume is an important contribution to the recent explosion of sociological analyses of the roles of animals in human life. The contribution is on two levels. First, Leslie Irvine collected qualitative data on an important sociological phenomenon: people who visit, and sometimes adopt, cats and dogs at an animal shelter. By participant observation as a volunteer animal adoption counselor in the shelter, she determined, for example, that appearance, behavior, and emotion are important in making a match. She distinguishes, however, between how these criteria are employed by three different types of adopters: “planners,” “the impartial,” and “the smitten.” On this level, this is classic sociological ethnography—and autoethnography, as when she relates her own status as one “smitten” in her cat‐person‐unexpectedly‐adopts‐unmanageable‐canine experience. Following early chapters that review domestication, theories of why people keep animals, and the histories of the categories “animal,” “pet,” and “companion animal” in the West, Irvine’s empirical chapters offer interesting insights into cat and dog adoption and cohabitation.</p>
      <p>The early chapters also set the stage for a contribution on a more fundamental level of sociology, which emerges as Irvine contemplates what she observes between dogs or cats and people at the shelter and in more ordinary situations. Irvine addresses the place of animals in a core subject matter of sociological theory, the self. What we are seeing is an invigorating return to speculations from earlier in sociology, such as that of Weber: “In so far [as the behavior of animals is subjectively understandable] it would be theoretically possible to formulate a sociology of the relations of men to animals, both domestic and wild. Thus many animals ‘understand’ commands, anger, love, hostility, and react to them in ways which are evidently often by no means purely instinctive and mechanical and in some sense both consciously meaningful and affected by experience” (<italic>The Theory of Social and Economic Organization</italic> [Oxford University Press, 1947, p. 104]).</p>
      <p>Why had not sociology pursued such a course? Partly, the reason may have been the lack of what Irvine coins “animal capital,” or “resources that enable the development of meaningful, nonexploitive companionship with animals” (p. 66)—capital stemming partly from strengthening ethological evidence of animals’ mentality. Also, another reason was the linguistic bent of symbolic interactionism. The dominance of the latter in theories of the self produced an interlude in social theory from which we are now awakening. Pioneers Arnold Arluke and Clinton Sanders held that “a central proposition here is that the difference between the abilities of people and nonhuman animals—a perceived difference that has thus far excluded animals from serious sociological attention—is a matter of degree rather than kind” (<italic>Regarding Animals</italic> [Temple University Press, 1996, p. 55]). Following suit, Irvine marshals animal capital to build a grounded theory of animals as subjective selves, differing only in degree from human selves. Her animal capital manifests in an ability to utilize densely contextualized descriptions of or by those close to animals to make seasoned judgments of animal intentionality.</p>
      <p>But some will still need to be convinced that claims such as hers are not “mere” anthropomorphism. Her response is a central contribution—the application of psychological and sociological models to the problem of animal selfhood. Here she adopts this reviewer’s earlier analysis of child‐animal interaction (<italic>Children and Animals</italic> [Westview, 1998]). I argued that children perceive animals as selves because they display the key markers of agency, coherence, affect, and continuity (sources of “core” self and other documented in empirical work in infant development synthesized by Daniel Stern in <italic>The Interpersonal World of the Infant</italic> [Basic Books, 1985]). Irvine focuses on the animal side, showing how animals convey these traits in interaction, and thus have selves. My data were on children, with animals with whom they lacked extensive relationships. Irvine’s cases are adults with enduring companionships with particular animals, and include cat‐cat, dog‐dog, and cat‐dog interactions, and they strongly support her extension of this framework.</p>
      <p>Irvine carves off a bigger challenge to argue that dogs, and perhaps cats, can attain intersubjectivity with humans, evincing a further form of selfhood and relatedness. According to Stern, intersubjectivity refers to sharing attention, affect, or intentions; it occurs with little awareness and before language between mothers and infants. The human experience of intersubjectivity shapes our perception of animals; we infer not only that a feeling is shared, but (crucially for true intersubjectivity) that it is known to be shared. Are such inferences necessarily distorted? Or is there a valid range of “degrees” of acknowledged sharing of subjective states with animals? In my view, Irvine’s cases where a history of sharing “reinforces itself and reinforces the self” (p. 161) say yes. Along the way, Irvine puts symbolic interactionist role theory, frame analysis, theories of play, and other sociological mainstays to original uses. In the end, she affirms the <italic>reality</italic> of selves, and the stern demands placed on us, knowing animals have them.</p>
