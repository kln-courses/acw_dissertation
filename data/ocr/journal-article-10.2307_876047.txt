<plain_text><page sequence="1">RECENT MUSEUM ACQUISITIONS Frequently exhibited and published, it has most recently been in New York in the exhibition 'The Machine as seen at the end of the Mechanical Age' at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in I968-69. Klee's 'Winterliche Maske' (National Gallery of Canada) ALTHOUGH the Winterliche Maske by Paul Klee (I879-I940) is classified as a drawing, it is still large and monumental enough to give the impression of a painting, the first on this scale by Klee in Ottawa's collection (Fig.4I). Neatly labelled and classi- fied on the mount by the artist as I925 V 3, it comes from that difficult time in which Klee was caught in limbo between the closing of the Bauhaus in Weimar, where he was still living, and his move in 1926 to its new headquarters in Dessau. Full of visual puns, delicately balanced on the disc below the neck, it is painted with apparent detachment, largely stencilled and stippled, the brush only used for the red touches of paint on the cap and for the black eyes. It is enigmatic in a way that is reminiscent of Fish Magic in the Philadelphia Museum or Around the Fish of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, of 1925 and 1926. Formerly in the Ida Bienert Collection, it was bought from Nathan in Zurich in I967. Rouault's 'Les Deux Filles' (National Gallery of Canada) OTHER works by Georges Rouault (1871-1958) at the National Gallery of Canada represent Man's redemption including three Crucifixions - a drawing for the Miserere, a good impression of a coloured print and a gouache which was a recent gift of G. Hamilton Southam. As a result this early water-colour and pastel of Deux Filles (Fig.42) is not only important as an early work, dated I906, but one which explains the fervour of Rouault's later religious preoccupation. Juxtaposed against contemporary Fauve paintings in the collection, a Derain of I905, a Braque of 1906, a Vlaminck of I908 and a Van Dongen of I909, its sober blues seem particularly joyless. At the same time, in the freshness and intensity of the water-colour and the boldness of the characterization it is a commanding work. These two prostitutes, nearly contemporaries of Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon, are almost as brutally rendered as their five colleagues in the Picasso - but with greater compassion. The poignancy seems even more intense than some famous related paintings by Rouault including The Prostitute and The Mirror in the Musee National d'Art Moderne in Paris. It was formerly in the Witzinger Collection, Basle, and was bought from the Marlborough Gallery, London, in I967. David Smith's 'Wagon I' (National Gallery of Canada) IN 1968 Wagon I by the American sculptor, David Smith, was acquired by the National Gallery of Canada (Fig.43). It comes from that particularly productive period in Smith's life, beginning with his months in Italy for the Spoleto Festival of 1962 and ending with his tragic death in a motor car accident in May I965. Most of his late works fall into two series, the silvery, burnished, stainless-steel Cubis or the colourful, painted Zigs, but among them, quite different from the rest, are three Wagons. The source of inspiration for the Wagons seems to have been his Italian stay. Of a man who could say 'I'm interested in all art', it is not unreasonable to suspect the influence of Etruscan bronzes. But there is also a suggestion in the brown-black painted steel assembly of parts of the scrap iron pieces at Voltri, the deserted factories where the Italian government had encouraged Smith to work. And there could be a wistful memory of the flatcar he was given but had to abandon and about which he said later: 'I could have loaded a flatcar with vertical sheets and planes ... I could have made a flatcar with cloud ends... In a year, I could have made a train.' Smith, himself, described his wagons: 'It's a kind of iron chariot, on four wheels, with open linear elements', and he also explained 'They are too heavy for people to handle so I put wheels on them'. Actually Wagon I is more humanly scaled than this would suggest and also, with links to Smith's surrealist past, more anthropomorphic. Wagon I, which was exhibited in the memorial exhibition of Smith's work at the Tate in 1966, was bought from the Smith estate through the Marlborough-Gerson Gallery in 1968. It is now to be seen in the retrospective exhibition arranged by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum; in its catalogue Edward Fry describes Wagon I as a 'robot centaur of the machine age'. Jackson Pollock's 'No. 29' (National Gallery of Canada) JACKSON POLLOCK'S No0.29 of I950 was the first large American abstract expressionist work to enter the collection of the National Gallery of Canada (Fig.44). Since gesture is such an important element in abstract expressionism, this work has a particular significance as the basis for the film Jackson Pollock of 1951 by Hans Namuth. Pollock worked on glass so that Namuth could photograph his face as he painted. The sheet of plate glass was placed on trestles outside on a sunny and cold autumn day, and Pollock was filmed putting the wire mesh, the strings, the pebbles and the pieces of coloured glass into place, rearranging them and finally binding them to the surface with black and aluminium paint, which he poured, manipulating it in the air with his stick, directly from their cans. Since the painting is on glass there are two images - the recto a coloured, crustaceous surface, the verso a black and silver record of the movements Pollock used in making the painting. In spite of the presence of Namuth's camera, Pollock succeeded in synthesizing the muscular ryhthms of his body, the unconscious energies of his mind and the inert objects from his environment into harmonious and even lyrical forms on the sheet of glass. No.29, which was acquired from the Pollock estate through the Marlborough-Gerson Gallery, New York, in 1967, is the only existing painting by Jackson Pollock on glass. Letters 'St John the Baptist preaching' in the Galleria Palatina SIR, I see in the March issue the attribution by Marco Chiarini to Elsheimer of a copper panel from the old Medici Collections belonging to the Galleria Palatina (No.366) showing St John the Baptist preaching. The suggestion is most stimulating and will not fail to arouse interest among specialists. 451</page><page sequence="2">LETTERS Though I am not one of these, I would like to express my opinion on this painting which has a distinct Elsheimer flavour. I have known it for many years, ever since it was preserved in a cupboard in the Cappella delle Reliquie of Palazzo Pitti. The correct attribution, which I feel it my duty to put forward for the benefit of students because it is supported by quite con- siderable evidence, would have been impossible for me to arrive at, had I not a specialized knowledge of Florentine painting of this period. That it is an Italian, and moreover a Florentine, work is apparent from many features; for example, from the group of boys clambering over the rocks in the background in order to be present at the preaching - an episode which I do not believe Elsheimer would have attempted. All the same, it is true that there are Elsheimer-like features in the landscape (where one can perhaps also detect traces of Tassi, a painter well known in Tuscany), in the disposition of the groups and in the marked characterization, but this preoccupation of Northern painters also occurs among certain Tuscans, such as Giovanni da San Giovanni. The painting is in all probability that cited by Baldinucci in his life of Anastagio Fontebuoni, who furnished him with a written memoir to help fill out his notes: 'Al Granduca Cosimo 11? dono un suo quadretto in rame d'un San Giovanni, in atto di predicare.' Cosimo II, as Chiarini recalls, was very interested in the art of Elsheimer, and this fact may help to explain the exceptional character of 'homage to Elsheimer' that the painting proclaims. I do not overlook the fact that in the Pitti Gallery (but coming from the Uffizi, No.II86) is exhibited a small copper (No.465) with the attribution to Fontebuoni, so described in nineteenth-century guidebooks which identify it with the picture cited by Baldinucci. But it should be pointed out that this was acquired with the attribution to Caravaggio from the quadreria Del Sera in 1777 (Archivio degli Uffizi, filza X, n.54). The sub- ject also precludes an identification with the painting given to Cosimo II, representing as it does St John hardly older than a baby, alone in the landscape and seated on a rock (in the docu- ment of 1777 it is in fact correctly described as 'San Giovanni sul rame in figura intera', and not in the act of preaching). Further- more, the Del Sera painting (a replica or copy of which was in the Cook Collection at Richmond, No.44 of Borenius's cata- logue) is close in style to Rosselli and lacks that characteristic luminosity which we know from the works of Fontebuoni in Rome and Florence, and which does occur, along with other unquestionable similarities, in No.366 in the Palatina. In Rome, where he was an Academician of St Luke in I607, Fontebuoni remained a long time and his stay there was crowned with success. He received commissions from churches (S.Balbina, S.Lucia in Selci, S.Giovanni dei Fiorentini, S. Prisca, etc.), was patronized by Cardinal Arrigoni and, as Luigi Salerno has pointed out,1 by Benedetto and Vincenzo Giustiniani. In the second decade of the seventeenth century he grew interested in the Caravaggists, particularly in Gentileschi and Saraceni (see, for instance, his Death of the Virgin in S. Giovanni dei Fiorentini) and in the circle of Elsheimer, as well as Emilians such as Bada- locchio and Gavassetti. In I617 he sent to Florence his painting for the Galleria Buonarroti (detail, Fig.46). In this work the small figures in the background, the lively rhythm which animates them, and the luminosity which is concentrated on the whites of the turbans and draperies have many affinities with the most 1 L. SALERNO: 'The Picture Gallery of Vincenzo Giustiniani - I', THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE [January I960], pp. 25-26. 452 notable aspects of the St John the Baptist preaching which, since it was given to Cosimo II who died in I620, must also belong to the second half of the decade I6IO-2o. In I620 Fontebuoni was in Tuscany; in 162I he was elected member of the Academy of Mantua; in I622 he received pay- ments for frescoes in the Casino di San Marco in Florence, in connection with which F. Sricchia2 has noted the intense lumin- ism 'in chiaro'. Soon afterwards we find him in the villa of Poggio Imperiale, undertaking the fresco with the Martyrdom of St Agatha (Fig.45) which provides further arguments, so it seems to me, in favour of giving the credit to the Florentine painter for this brilliant Elsheimer-like episode.

The Elephant SIR, The iconography of the Elephant has been treated by no less an authority than A. E. Popham. Now Mr F. J. B. Watson tells us of an example said to belong to the early period of Meissen from the Forsyth Wickes Collection in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (your April number, p.217, Fig.45). 'It is a piece of the utmost rarity,' he says, with justification. The British Museum example, now on view, and illustrated by Mr Hugh Tait in his Skira volume on Porcelain in colour, has long interested me. If this model is indeed early Meissen, surely we are faced with the problem of attributing it to an artist hitherto unidentified, and a man of genius who must have been among the earliest European decorative sculptors to render the elephant naturalistically as it is seen for instance at the Albert Memorial. The hitherto known Meissen elephants are pig-like in proportion, compared with this masterly group. I have sug- gested to Mr Tait, who is by no means averse to taking my views into consideration, that we should look rather into the mid-nine- teenth century for the iconography of this rare piece of Chin- oiserie. Much must, of course, depend on the ormolu mount. The British Museum example also has one, but it seems, from the photograph, inferior to that of the Boston piece. Incidentally, Mr Watson speaks of the colour as 'clair-de-lune celadon'. The Chinese monochrome known as 'clair-de-lune' should properly be identified with a pale blue high-fired cobalt glaze, lighter in tone, but similar in chemical content to that known as 'Lavender'. I imagine that the Boston example is however green rather than blue. The existence of a green monochrome in early Meissen, one of the very few high- temperature glazes used on European porcelain, is well known; but it is much paler than here; the British Museum piece at any rate is of a colour which has aroused the interest not only of Mr Tait but of Mr Du Boulay of Christie's, who has, I believe, noted a third example of the group. The name of the brilliant ceramist Thomas Deck of Paris has been mentioned, a nine- teenth-century master now coming into belated fame. Could this uncommon colour be an early example of the use of chrom- ium? I submit, Sir, that Mr Watson has with his usual acumen provided us with a fascinating problem. W. W.
