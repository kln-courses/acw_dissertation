<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS: GENERAL reason to scripture and also as an invaluable example of Qur'an exegesis from the period of greatest Mu tazilT intellectual influence. The editor has established the text (pp. 48-144) on the basis of five manuscripts which he suggests (pp. 44-47) represent three families. He also provides an English translation (pp. 49-145 facing the Arabic) which, if somewhat clumsy in places and occasionally misleading (e.g. 'for it is an attribution of a copartner to God' for li-anna dhalika shirk, pp. 114-115), gives a helpful guide to the intricacies of the Arabic. The edition contains an introduction with a brief history of arguments against anthropomorphism from ancient times to classical Islam and summary of the Epistle's contents (pp. 1-18), a survey of al-Qasim's attitude towards the Qur'an from his surviving writings (pp. 19-29), and a discussion of his interpretative methods in this work (pp. 30-43). Much helpful material is included, though the edition lacks any information about al-Qasim himself or his works, and any indication of how the Epistle may have been influenced by and in turn have influenced other works. Its place in the tradition to which al-Qasim made this distinctive contribution is left to be resolved by others.

Richmond, Curzon, 1996. xi, 282 pp. ?14.99. These books are both very useful additions to the existing literature on Sufism, and continue the enterprising series on Sufi studies which Curzon has initiated. What is particularly useful about this series is that it makes available in English, often for the first time, works by important Sufi thinkers. These are thinkers who are often well known in the Islamic world, and who are significant for the Sufi thinkers whose works have become popular in English, and so it is doubly necessary to have some account of them available for anyone interested in the area of Islamic mysticism. Abdullah Ansarn lived in the tenth century CE, was born in Herat into a Sufi family and had a typically tumultuous career during which he went in and out of favour with the authorities and his peers largely as a result of his antagonism to what he took to be the anthropomorphism of the Ash'arites. He is best known as a staunch defender of HanbalT Islam, and his works resound with the argument that the Qur'an is pre-eternal and uncreated. Despite his Hanbalism, though, Ansari was also a Sufi, albeit certainly not the variety of Sufism which has since Ibn al-'Arabi become so well known, and remains popular in both the Shi'i and Sunni worlds. In fact, he is today far better known in the Shi'i community than in the Sunni, perhaps because it is far neater to see Hanbalism as an antagonist of Sufism. We should remember that there is a branch of Sufism which opposes ecstatic mysticism, and Ansar is a representative of such a branch. His writings display a consistent suspicion of ecstatic mysticism, an attitude in 301</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS: GENERAL which he was joined by Ibn Taymiyya later in the fourteenth century CE. Farhadi is surely mistaken in suggesting that the latter was critical of Sufism; like Ansari, he was only critical of a particular type of Sufism, the ecstatic version. After a brief but very clear introduction to the life of Ansarl, Farhadi presents translations of selections from the major writings. Many of these will be unfamiliar, since they exist originally in Dari- Persian, and do give something of the flavour of his writings. We should remember, of course, that what we have as his writings are mainly the notes of his students, but there is a remarkable consistency none the less between the different works we can read here, whether on theology or serving as Sufi training texts. It is certainly difficult to reconcile the hostility which he felt for ecstatic Sufism with his Munajat (Intimate Invocations), which continue to be very popular with all kinds of Sufis. Al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi was a very different kind of mystic. A much earlier thinker, born in the ninth century CE, he was enthusiastically taken up by Ibn al-'ArabT, but is little mentioned in the intervening centuries. The authors argue plausibly that al- TirmidhT is representative of a type of theosophy which existed before the introduction of the formal falsafah tradition within the Islamic world. On the contrary, his works are full of references to the Gnostics and the Neoplatonists, Shi'i as well as Sunni theories, mystical experience, cosmology and the whole range of Islamic theology. The translations of his works, which constitute most of the text, are careful and clear, and give something of the flavour of his thought. His autobiography is interesting both for being the earliest such text in Arabic, and for its inclusion of dreams in appropriate mystical style as a genuine source of knowledge. The authors are well-advised to stress his writings on the notion of being a friend of God, since this is perhaps the only aspect of al-Tirmidhi's thought which has survived. The text has a disputational structure, and one imagines that it was written during a protracted controversy concerning the precise definition of what the criteria for a friend of God are. He explains here how turning one's back on the world can lead to spiritual growth, to being confirmed in one's spiritual rank by God leading to the appropriate description as the friend of God. There are obviously many errors one can make on the way, since the text is replete with warnings and accounts of how easy it is to go awry, which is also interesting, as it shows that even at this comparatively early period there must have been a lot of arguments about the precise nature of the friend of God. The only reservation I have with the book is the title. Is the friend of God really a saint? The notion of 'saint' is such a Christian one that its application to an Islamic concept is always likely to be questionable, and it certainly is here. The friend of God has a special relationship with God, he has reached a high spiritual level and as a result of this and what God will do for him he can acquire great understanding, and the ability to interpret the direction and nature of reality. Describing this person as holy is roughly acceptable, but making the further claim that sainthood is involved is misleading. Fortunately, it is not a misunderstanding which in any way is allowed to intrude in the clear account of al-Tirmidhi's views in the book.
