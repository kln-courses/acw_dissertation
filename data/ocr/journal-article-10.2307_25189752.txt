Margoliouth, D.Litt., Laudiaii Professor of Arabic in the University of Oxford, and printed for the Trustees of the E. J. W. Gibb Memorial. Vol. iii, pt. i, containing part of the letter ?. pp. xv + 219. Leyden, Brill ; London, Luzac &amp; Co. ; 1910. We see with pleasure the second volume of Professor Margoliouth's work followed, at scarcely a year's interval from our notice of it in the JllAS., 1909, pp. 778-81, by the first part of the third volume, which, in regard to variety of interest, in no way falls short of its predecessors. In its compass, which covers the letter II down to and including the notice of al-Hasan b. Maimfin al-Nasri, the author has found occasion to give biographical notices of great importance, which provide, and that more copiously than do the works of previous writers, data of surpassing interest for the intellectual history of Islam. The earlier portions of the work made us awrare of the wealth of material which Y?q?t was enabled to utilize by reason of his wide travel and his habit of getting into personal touch with his informants (see p. G5, 1. 1). In the portion of the work now before us we find him availing himself of biographical material derived directly from informants, and frequently relying for his quotations on copies in the actual hand of their authors (pp. 12, 12; 14, 4; 19, 3; 58, 8; 131, infra ; 169, 12); on p. 54, 9 ff., are recorded various autograph Sima*. He often gives us a scientific estimate of the nature of the material he has before him ; if his copy be not wholly correct, he does not ignore the fact (p. 22, 2), nor does he maintain through thick and thin JUAS. 1910. 57</page><page sequence="2">886 notices of books the trustworthiness of his sources, but points out critically their deficiencies ; and he expressly tells us when a work he cites from is not before him, but is quoted from recollection only (p. 85, 10): Numerous biographies of noted philologists occur in the volume, e.g. Abu 'Ali al-Fiiris?, the two 'Askari, Abu Ni zar the "Monarch of Grammarians ", Abu-l-'Al? al Hamadhiuii, etc. ; but its pi?ce de r?sistaiice is the notice, amounting to a monograph, on Abu Sa'id al-Sir?fi (pp. 84-125). Here Y?q?t again makes copious drafts on Abu Hayy?n al-Tauh?di, from whose lost works so much valuable information was given in the preceding volumes, as we incidentally pointed out in reviewing vol. ii. In the present volume (p. 86, 4 a.f.) we again meet the Eulogy of Dj?hiz (js^r ^ $j+?- la?yu ), quoted already in vol. i, p. 141, 1. 12, in an extract from it taken by Y?q?t from an autograph by its author. The material drawn from Abu Hayy?n for the notice of al-Sir?fi?valuable in the extreme as giving us au insight into al-Sir?fi's relations with his colleagues, and thus into the general intercourse of the learned world of the period?is taken from his *L*J-*Jl t^Ac* (passim) and from his cl-::.*]H c?*Lsj? (p. 92,2). Especially are we indebted to Y?q?t for having preserved to us in this notice an account of the philosophic discussion which took place A.H. 320 at the court of the vizier Ibn al-Fur?t at Baghdad between S?r?f? and the philosopher Alm Bishr Matt? b. Y?nus in the presence of a large assemblage of learned and eminent persons. It is a strong testimony to that development of a philosophic method (?&amp;s?+\\ Jlc ^UJJ\ &lt;L*U0 in the domain of Arab philology which has been already treated by the reviewer in the ZDMG., 1877, vol. xxxi, pp. 545-9. In this discussion Sir?fi sets out, as against his opponent, the reasons for not attempting to regard linguistic</page><page sequence="3">THE IRSHAD AL-'AR1H ILA MA'RIFAT AL-ADIR 887 matters from the point of view of a system of logic, and it was in a very similar spirit that Ahmad b. al Tayyib al-Sarachsi (ob. a.h. 286), a pupil of al-Kindi, at an earlier date composed his c_jyJ\ ys? ^ jyill l-j\'? jfk-.+Uj (Ibn abi Usaibi'a, i, p. 215). The discussion as recorded by Abu Ilayy?n has been independently edited by Professor Margoliouth in the pages of this Journal, 1905, pp. 79-129, with text based on that of Yiiqfit, a translation, and an illuminating introduction to which I would add this, that the discussion is also recorded in a brief and summarized form in the Muk?bas?t of Abu Ilayy?n, No. 22 (ed. Bombay, p. 21). The biographical notices disclose many particulars of interest on Islamic questions, and to some of them I will draw attention. The story derived from Ibn Zfil?k, p. 8, i H'., of the application of a Iladith to the career of the Jewish convert Ya'k?b b. Killis, the favourite and vizier of the Fatimide Caliph 'Aziz, is a marked contribution to the character of that remarkable man, and supplements very happily the portrait given of him in Ibn al-Qal?nisi (ed. Amedroz, p. 32). Again, bearing in mind what we were told in vol. ii of the boundless conceit of the S?hib ibn 'Abb?d, it is peculiarly curious to find here this very vain personage requesting a correspondent, Abu 'Ali al F?ris?, and that in decided contradiction to the contemporary practice so vividly depicted by Hil?l al-S?bi (ed. Amedroz, p. 148 ff.), to refrain in his case from using the customary exaggerated and inflated styles of address, and to restrict himself to the minimum possible. And it must have been a matter of rare occurrenee for a born Moslem to he so familiar with Hebrew, as we are told was the case with the Egyptian philologer, al-llasan b. al-Zi'r (ob. a.h. 598), that a learned Jew should assert on oath that he would be taken to be a Rabbi (;1&gt;&gt;-). It is indeed recorded of many Moslem theologians, amongst others of Fakhr al-Din al ll?zi, that they were well acquainted with the Taur?t</page><page sequence="4">888 notices of books (ZDMG., vol. xxxii, p. 360; ZATW., vol. xiii, p. 315; cf. also Ibn Khallik?n, ed. W?stenfeld, No. 757, de Si. Eng., iii, p. 468, who says of Abu-1-Fatli al-Mausili, ob. A.n. 639, that he expounded to Jews the Taur?t), yet no complete knowledge of the Hebrew language should therefore be assumed in these persons, for their knowledge of the Hebrew Bible can be accounted for by Arabic translations. Certain it is, however, that the Hebraic linguistic ability of al-IIasan b. al-Zi'r was considered in Moslem circles to be a phenomenal exception. A very welcome addition to the information I was able to put together on the dogmatic Madhhab of the *u*!L: (ZDMG., vol. lxi, p. 73 ff.) occurs in this volume, p. 153, 3 a.f. ; it tells us of the gross anthropomorphic conception which they formed of the Deity ; and a repre sentative of the Madhhab, Abu 'Ali al-Ahw?zi (ob. a.h. 446, in Damascus), is shown engaged in forming a special collection of hadith-sentences with a view to the propaga tion of false traditions calculated to further the coarse and materialistic conception. Among passages of special interest in the volume may be instanced on pp. 169 ff. an exchange of satirical letters between Hasan al-Qatt?n and llashid Watw?t, the former accusing the latter of having wrongfully appropriated and plagiarized his works?an accusation which is repelled by Rashid Watw?t so cleverly as to form a masterpiece of epistolary skill. It were an easy matter to go on noting details of interest?and indeed Sir?fis digression on the treatment in law of nabidh (p. 94) must not be passed over wholly unnoticed?but to continue thus would lead us too far away from the scope of this review. Readers of the two earlier volumes will bear in mind the severe difficulties which beset the edition of the text, and the carefulness with which Professor Margoliouth assailed the imperfections of his ALS., hitherto his sole material for this important work. These difficulties he has again</page><page sequence="5">THE IRSIIAD AL-'aRIIS ILA MA'RIFAT AL-ADI11 889 had to face in this volume, and he has been at pains, and with success, to correct in foot-notes with critical acumen many weak points of his text. In many cases he has \ eiy happily emended inadmissible readings, although in some few cases I should be disposed to retain those that yield an intelligible meaning. Such cases are: p. 19, n. 3; p. 109, n. 5 ; and p. 157, n. 1, where the phrase .?&gt; J &lt;ol uJ'ljj &lt;ui is identical with that occurring in vol. ii, 276, 6, as amended by me, JltAS., 1909, p. 779, &lt;ui referring to ytAll. On the following passages I submit to the editor certain emendations, some in amplification of his own, and some expressing dissent therefrom.

With the volume now before me the contents of the Bodleian MS. used up to this point by Professor Margoliouth are exhausted. He will now give a sigh of relief, for in the further prosecution of his work he will not be restricted to this irksome subject-matter, but will have better and more trustworthy material at his disposal. The text will not proceed continuously : a gap will now occur extending to the notice of 'Ubaid Allah b. Muhammad, at which point Professor Margoliouth will enter on a volume to be numbered V. For this part of the work he has had a good MS. placed at his disposal by Professor Muhammad'Abbas of Bombay, and we may therefore confidently expect that the further portions of this valuable source of history, by the publication of which the Trustees of the Gibb Memorial are rendering us in our studies a very material service, will at no distant date be placed within our reach by Professor Margoliouth.
