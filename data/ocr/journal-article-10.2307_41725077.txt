WALES By EVAN M. CHAPMAN CARMARTHENSHIRE (1) Pumsaint (SN 6640 4020): geophysical survey examined two areas (fig. 2), one (Area A) encompassing the presumed north-eastern corner of the fort and the adjacent extramural area, immediately to the north of that surveyed in 1999 (Area C),1 the other (Area B) covering part of the western side of the fort beyond the excavated areas.2 Survey in Area A added little to the debate about the proposed line of the fort's eastern defences, beyond the hint of a possible ditch aligned with its southern counterpart just short of what would have been the north-east corner, here obscured by one of two large thermoremnant anomalies. Beyond this several features would seem to indicate the existence of two separate enclosures, both set at an angle to the projected line of the fort defences. That nearest the fort is represented by a ditch extending along the northern side of the two anomalies, which is partly obscured by a curving ditch or drain of unknown date extending to the north-west. It forms a corner at its eastern end, its southerly continuation apparently aligning with a feature in Area C, which extends at an angle to the east of the bath-house at least as far as the east-west road. The second enclosure is represented in Area A by a prominent curving feature, outside and east of the first, which also seems to link up with a linear anomaly extending across Area C at a distance of c. 22 m from its inner counterpart. Both enclosures present problems of interpretation and dating, but clearly indicate a greater complexity than has been recognised hitherto. The inner of the two certainly marks a boundary between an area of significant magnetic noise to the south and a magnetically quiet area to the north. Either, or both, might indicate the presence of a military annexe at an angle to the presumed fort or its fortlet successor. Survey in Area B identified a double anomaly coinciding with the line of the fort's western defences; although there was no obvious break at the site of the projected gate, the area immediately to the east does not contain any buildings, which strongly suggests the presence of an internal road leading to a gate. A small rectangular anomaly close to the defences might also represent part of a gate-tower akin to that found at the north gate in 1989.3 Fragmentary traces of at least one rectangular building were identified south of the presumed road on the known alignment of the excavated buildings. A fuller picture here has been obscured by modern ferrous and garden anomalies.4 1 For previous work see Britannia 31 (2000), 372. G.D.B. Jones and J.H.

CHAPMAN CEREDIGION (1) Abermagwr (SN 6688 7416): the second season of excavations explored the western half of the central and largest room of the house (Room 2) and part of the verandah (Room 7), and saw the total excavation of Room 6 which had been added to the rear of the house (fig. 3).5 All walling had been robbed: the wall foundations - particularly those of the north and south walls of the house - comprised substantial trenches filled with closely-packed river cobbles. A sherd of a black burnished cooking pot incorporated in the foundation trench of the north wall remains the only securely stratified find relating to its construction. In all instances the floors - including that of Room 1 which was partly exposed - were of earth. Room 2 had been provided with an off-centre slab-edged and stone-floored hearth measuring 1.1m by 0.95 m, whilst a partly stone-built circular oven had been set against the south wall. A trench dug to examine what appeared, on a geophysical survey, to be a drain running east from the eastern ala of the house, revealed a large, rectangular pit seemingly dug with a view to adding a hypocausted room. This appears never to have been completed, the pit being filled with rubble and domestic rubbish. Fragments of flue tile, brick and imbrices from this fill suggest the probable re-use of building material from the bath-house of the long abandoned auxiliary fort at Trawscoed. Numismatic and ceramic evidence indicates a floruit for the building c. A.D. 270-350, although two issues of Severus Alexander, one struck in A.D. 224 and unlikely to be in circulation beyond c. a.D. 250, suggest that occupation may have begun somewhat earlier. The incidence of a few sherds of later first- to early second-century samian and coarsewares may possibly be explained by agricultural activities relating to the nearby fort at Trawscoed. Part of the slate roof over Rooms 1 and 2 collapsed during a fire sometime after A.D. 325 on the basis of coin evidence. However, later activity is evidenced by post-holes dug through the floors of Rooms 2 and 6, whilst at least one fireplace in Room 1 was built of re-used roofing slates. An unusual discovery in Room 6 were fragments of a deep convex facet- and linear-cut glass bowl or cup with several zones of decoration and of third- to fourth-century date. Examination of the double-ditched enclosure bounding the villa failed to produce unequivocal evidence of its date, although the inner ditch had been re-cut, its upper fill being used as a repository for domestic rubbish in the third to fourth century.6 5 For previous work see Britannia 42 (201 1), 320-1.

There was a secondary narrow entrance in the rear wall and a portico or corridor appears to have run along the front of the building. There were fragmentary remains of a clay floor that contained hearths, ovens and stones that had been used as working surfaces. The building had been partially destroyed by fire. A roughly-paved floor was subsequently laid over the debris and the building was re-used, perhaps as a warehouse. The house was one of the higher status buildings in the settlement and occupied a prime position overlooking the landing place on the shore of the Menai Strait.9 7 Work by Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust on behalf of Cadw.

Trench C on the north-east corner of the property, close to the Roman east gate, consisted of disturbed twentieth-century deposits, showing that no sensitive archaeological remains survived above the limits of the trial excavation, a depth of 1.7 m. A rubble-filled trench, believed to be a robber trench, was revealed in Trench B, close to the street frontage on the north-west of the property. Trench A, on the south-west corner of the property, exposed a more complicated archaeological resource, which was edged on the eastern side by disturbed ground - possibly a robber trench or an even more recent disturbance associated with the recorded destruction and re-building of the standing structures. Finds from Trenches A and B were all of Roman date; the largest group of 98 sherds came from Trench A and included samian, Oxford wares, South Wales grey ware and black burnished ware dating from the second to the fourth centuries.10 (2) Gwehelog Fawr, Llancayo Farm (SO 3629 0306): a large marching camp was confirmed during aerial reconnaissance.11 The camp measures 500 m north-south by 400 m east-west, and encloses approximately 20.2 ha. There are only five marching camps in Wales and the Marches enclosing 12-20 ha, and only three examples greater than 20 ha.12 As yet there is no evidence for the positions of the gateways. The camp is sited to make full use of the central and northern part of a broad alluvial terrace, which rises 22-30 m above OD, set within a wide meander of the river Usk. It entirely encloses the Gwehelog Roman temple,13 which may have developed from an earlier Iron Age shrine. The camp lies some 3 km north-west of the legionary fortress at Usk and is the first marching camp to be recorded in Gwent. It is probably of pre-Flavian date and raises the possibility of further discoveries in this region of south-east Wales.14 (3) Monmouth, William Jones almshouses (SO 5104 1304): several small sherds of Roman pottery were recovered during an evaluation, including South Gaulish ware and a fragment of black burnished plain-rimmed dish. These fragments were residual in nature and could not be associated with any archaeological features.15 (4) Usk, 72 Maryport Street (SO 37792 00564): a watching-brief recorded deposits associated with the final destruction of the fortress, as well as a feature which could represent the partial closure of the fortress in the late 60s. There was a heavy deposit of stone and mortar from the destruction of a large building; this may have been part of the pre-Flavian legionary baths,16 the demolition of which may have occurred prior to the main closure of the fortress. The final destruction of the fortress appeared to be marked by the layer of burnt clay, daub and soil in the trenches.17 A further feature was cut into the natural, running roughly east-west across the site.18 10 Work by S.

CHAPMAN NEATH, PORT TALBOT (1) Neath ( Nidum ), Dwr-y-Felin School (SS 746 978): excavation uncovered defensive ditches, the rampart, ovens and an internal roadway, giving a whole new understanding of the early first-century fort and the area outside its north-west gate. It also proved that the early fort was larger than its successor and that a large part of it lay outside the area of scheduled ancient monument. The defences of the timber fort consisted of a rampart and five parallel V-shaped ditches, with a combined width of about 12 m; however, it is not possible to be certain that all of them were in use at the same time. Further defensive measures included an interval tower that projected beyond the rampart. The defensive ditches were interrupted, leaving a road about 4 m wide, to allow access to the north-west gate. Sometime later a wide area of cobble hardstanding was laid over the ends of the ditches, but possibly only immediately outside of the gateway. Subsequently, a road to the west, whose route can be traced to the north-west gateway of the second-century stone fort, was laid over the hardstanding. The rampart, which ran along the edge of the innermost of the ditches, was about 6.7 m wide. The front was supported on a stone foundation made from rubble and cobbles and the back was faced with turf. In between, the core was made from a mixture of soil dug from the ditches and clay. About half way between the gateway and the corner of the fort was an interval tower. Its position was marked by the remains of three large post-holes and by breaks in the stone foundation of the rampart; the post-hole at the fourth corner was indistinct. Two of the posts were set into the front edge of the rampart but, possibly uniquely in Britain, the other two were set into the ditch on the outside of the rampart. This tower would have allowed soldiers to shoot at anyone attacking the gate. Another unusual feature was found in the face of the rampart, between the interval tower and the gateway. The line of the stone foundation had been broken to form a recess projecting into the rampart core with its ends angled inward on each side, with at the back what seems to have been a trench for a palisade. The purpose of this feature is unknown but it and a pit dug near the gateway could be related to the extracting of gravel from the earlier ditches for the later fort. Part of the internal road (via sagularis) that ran around the inside of the fort was discovered. Between it and the rampart were the remains of a cluster of seven ovens, with another lying about 12 m away. They were represented by circular bases of flagstones or cobbling enclosed by walls in the local sandstone. One of these ovens underwent refurbishment and enlargement to become a rectangular oven. The overlying soil in this area was blackened with charcoal, probably the remains of fuel raked out of the ovens. Outside the fort very few traces of activity were found, apart from a building that had already been seen during a trial excavation in the 1990s and a road,19 which likely served the later stone-built fort, and other features including ditches and stone deposits associated with later Roman occupation of the site.20 NEWPORT (1) Caerleon (Isca): (a) Broadway Farm (centred on ST 338 902): part of the areas surveyed previously using other instruments21 was resurveyed using a caesium vapour gradiometer, giving almost complete coverage of the 'monumental complex' at an improved resolution.22 (b) Caerleon AFC (centred on ST 335 907): geophysical surveys showed a substantial linear structure on an alignment slightly oblique to that of the fortress, running approximately down the centre of the pitch. The orientation was close to that of some of the early timber buildings 19 For previous work see Britannia 25 (1994), 250. Excavations in advance of building work, by M.

This is likely to be a significant water supply leading to the fortress from the springs and small streams within the area of St Cadoc's Hospital.24 (c) Caerleon Comprehensive School Field (centred on ST 334 905): much of the southern part of the field is made-ground, but geophysical surveys did show a slight magnetic anomaly corresponding in location to the earthwork feature previously identified as a track.25 It is possible that the variable depth of fill over the earthwork allowed its expression in the magnetic survey. In the remainder of the field, most geophysical anomalies could be identified with drains running downslope from the school campus. Anomalies interpreted to be of more ancient origin were restricted to several positive linear magnetic anomalies. The westernmost examples, a paired set of linear features extending almost east-west down the slope, were probably small ditches flanking a narrow trackway - somewhat similar to features recorded on the golf driving range to the south-east. None of these linear features was conclusively Roman, but none showed a distinct relationship to any aspect of the post-medieval landscape. Between the drains in the eastern part of the field was a very strong positive resistivity anomaly, approximately 4 m square, indicative of a buried masonry or concrete structure. The intensity and clarity of the anomaly contrasted with those of all the Roman archaeological features within the surveys and suggest it was very shallow. An interpretation as a relatively modern feature is therefore preferred 26 (d) 9 Lodge Road (ST 33635 90922): a watching-brief did not reveal any structural remains although some features and possible occupation levels suggest that significant Roman remains lie beneath or close to the development site. The contexts which were entered, only to a depth of 0.5 m below ground level, produced a significant assemblage of Roman pottery.27 (e) Southern canabae (centred on ST 338 902): evaluation excavations explored several structures within the recently discovered complex of monumental buildings between Broadway Farm, the amphitheatre, and the river Usk.28 Nine trenches were opened across an area of approximately 5 ha. They showed that the remains of the Roman buildings are remarkably well preserved just below the modern ground surface. Four of the trenches were located around the very large courtyard structure closest to the river, including two in the courtyard itself. These demonstrated that the pre-Roman land surface sloped gradually towards the river, but that the course of river itself must have been some distance further east than was previously believed. The tegula wall exposed in the 2010 test-pits was shown to be the external wall of a row of buildings that lay parallel to the river and could have been associated with a quay that has since been eroded away. A roadway passed between these buildings and a corridor-like structure that is thought to be the front wing of the large courtyard building. A fragment of a monumental inscription bearing the letters AVG is possibly part of an imperial dedication from this part of the complex. Further walls constructed with brick and tile were found in other locations, and a structure located on the main axis through the courtyard had been built entirely with clay-bonded triangular tiles. The courtyard itself was provided with a cobbled surface, into 23 G.C. Boon and C. Williams, Plan of Caerleon, Isca: Legio II Augusta. Discoveries to December 1966 (1967).

The remaining five evaluation trenches were located to investigate other structures within the complex. These revealed part of two basilica-like buildings whose rooms and corridors had been provided with opus signinum floors and painted wall plaster, a disturbed hypocaust, open courtyards, and buildings that could have served as workshops. Numerous segmented circular bricks demonstrate the use of brick columns in parts of at least two buildings. Several drains were discovered running beneath these buildings and in one instance a drain outlet was found within a step into a building from which water would have simply poured into the adjacent open space. One end of a lead pipe, which presumably supplied fresh water down slope to the main courtyard structure, terminated with a circular plate that still contained the nails with which it had been attached to a tank of some kind. The trench overlooking the main axis of the large courtyard structure produced the remains of a collapsed barrel vault, constructed of courses of tufa and sandstone voussoirs, which had collapsed into the room below. This discovery, together with the edge of a tessellated floor uncovered at the end of the same trench, indicates that several of the buildings in the southern canabae complex were very elaborate indeed.29 (f) The Retreat, Isca Road (ST 34436 90140): archaeological work during groundworks for an extension revealed that substantial Roman stonework survived on the site. During external excavations a line of very large conglomerate blocks was revealed which may have been the uneven but substantial foundation for a timber-framed building. Close to this was what appeared to be an industrial area of burned soil which was associated with a small square stone-paved area. A very substantial Roman structure was exposed during the removal of internal walling in the south-eastern room of the standing house. The building was associated with disturbed flooring on the south with a narrow drain built against it on the north. To the south-western side of the structure, a large fawn-coloured, bevel-edged, sandstone block may have been the base for a column. A cobbled surface exposed in the same room ran under the eastern wall of the standing house towards Isca Road. The construction and depth of the make-up beneath the cobbles suggest that this may have been the Roman road, which the modern road follows.30 POWYS (1) Brecon Gaer (SO 002 297): geophysical survey around the periphery of the fort revealed significant extramural activity along the road leading from the fort's northern gate, but only patchy traces of activity outside the south and west gates, while the flat field to the east of the fort was virtually featureless. Small-scale test pitting, taken down to the top of any surviving archaeology, supplemented by augering, demonstrated that the geophysics were misleading on the east side of the fort and that there were archaeological levels across much of the field, confirming what had previously been implied by metal detecting. On the south side, where the defences lie back from the lip of the river terrace, and the gently sloping ground appears favourable for settlement, only intermittent Roman activity was revealed, and on the west side of the fort virtually nothing showed up. North-east of the fort a small area was subjected to further geophysical survey, and test pitting provided some indication of the extent of the vicus to the east of the road leading northwards from the fort.31 29 Excavations, supported by Cardiff University, the Roman Research Trust, the Haverfield Bequest, Newport City Council and Time Team, were directed by P.

These were clearer than had been seen on any previous occasion and add considerably to the published plan.32 The main 103 m by 81 m enclosure can be seen to be rectangular, regular on three sides but with an angular north-east corner; it encloses 0.8 ha. The cropmarks have also clarified a main square inner enclosure, 38 m by 43 m, and demonstrate that this sat within a larger, concentric square enclosure 57 m across. Both the main outer enclosure and the inner enclosure have simple gateways in their eastern sides, while the main outer enclosure may also be broken by a narrow gate on its northern boundary. The cropmarks have also clarified the western edges of at least two rather irregular sub-rectangular enclosures to the south-east of the main site, the northern one 54 m long north- south, and the southern one some 49 m long, one overlapping the other. Some 72 m south of the main enclosure, and lying between it and the Hindwell Brook, are three sides of a further 32 m-square enclosure with rounded corners and slightly irregular sides. Cropmarks show one or two other lengths of ditch in the field, particularly a curving and angular pair of incomplete ditches outside the south-eastern corner of the main enclosure.33 FIG. 5.

CHAPMAN (3) Llanfìhangel Cwmdu, Pen-y-gaer vicus (SO 168 219): excavations identified at least three masonry structures, associated with separate phases of activity.34 The nature and extent of the buildings remains uncertain, but a hearth in the earliest building could indicate domestic use, while the later structures may have had a more industrial function, and possibly may have been workshops associated with a walled enclosure. There was plentiful evidence for smithing taking place close by.35 (4) Llanyre, Castell Collen vicus (SO 055 628): test pitting beyond the eastern and southern defences of the fort provided broad indications of the extent of the vicus on the river terrace of the Ithon, spreading down onto the valley floor.36 (5) Montgomery (SO 21 97): a hoard of 4,854 base silver radiates was found by metal detection. The coins range from Gordian III (a.D. 238-44) to Tetricus I and II (in Gaul, A.D. 271-4), closing around a.D. 273^4, shortly before the end of the Gallic Empire issues. The hoard was contained in a pot, lacking neck and rim but probably a jar, of orange fabric akin to Severn Valley ware. Fieldwork established that the pot had been placed in the ground just inside the later of two successive sub-rectangular ditched enclosures.37 (6) Welshpool, Smithfield (SJ 2296 0746): excavations re-examined the site where an important collection of Roman metal vessels was discovered during the excavation of a service trench in 1959. 38 The service trench was reopened, together with the adjacent trench excavated by George Boon in 1960. The backfill of both trenches contained small fragments from the vessels. The service trench had cut the southern side of a previously unrecognised elongated pit, although it is unlikely that this was associated with the finds. The records indicate that the Roman artefacts were concentrated in a relatively small area and the new evidence implies that the ironwork lay within a feature that had been cut shallowly into the subsoil. It seems likely that the finds were buried within a shallow pit which was disturbed in its entirety by the workmen in 1959. The recent excavations failed to reveal any evidence for associated structures or deposits, or provide any stratigraphical link to the other Roman features on the site. The other features of Roman date were generally not closely dated owing to a lack of chronologically diagnostic finds. The earliest features appeared to be associated with agricultural activity and may represent part of a field-system revealed by a series of gullies that could be contemporary with traces of plough-scarring of the subsoil surface. Some of the gullies were later replaced by rows of posts, which presumably formed a fenced boundary. These boundary features were later cut by a ditch running north-west to south-east, towards the Lledan brook, which produced the only datable pottery, although this showed a wide date range from the late first or early second century into the fourth century. Collectively, these features indicate the presence of some form of Roman settlement in the immediate area, although the excavations produced no evidence for any structures.39 SWANSEA (1) Swansea, former David Evans store , Princess Way (SS 65601 93122): two sherds of residual Roman pottery were recovered from west of the castle defences.

SCOTLAND By FRASER HUNTER NORTH OF THE ANTONINE WALL MORAY (1) Clarkly Hill (NJ 131 675): geophysical survey and excavation41 revealed a long-lived later prehistoric unenclosed settlement with Roman contacts. Further denarii from the hoard, which had been scattered in antiquity, were recovered. Other finds included a trumpet brooch and an extensive range of Iron Age material.42 PERTH AND KINROSS (1) Inchtuthil (NO 125 397): detailed geophysical survey added considerably to earlier work.43 Resistivity survey confirmed that a rectangular enclosure on the promontory has a ditch on only three sides, and is thus unlikely to be a camp.44 The large camp south of the fortress showed dense pitting across the interior, while a probable third barrack was identified in the 'officers' compound' to the east.45 High-resolution survey produced great detail of buildings within the fortress, including the hospital (fig. 6), principia and fabrica , and revealed that the oval feature outside the north-east gate is unlikely to be an amphitheatre; it is a conflation of two separate anomalies.

The ditches run to the present loch shoreline without turning, suggesting the eastern end has been eroded. No cross-ditch correlates with kinks in these east-west ditches, dismissing arguments for an annexe here; the irregularity perhaps suggests a change of plan during construction. It seems this large fort (c. 3.6 ha (8.9 acres) over the inner ditch) faced east, with a large praetentura and a much-reduced retentura. An outwork ditch provided additional defence on the eastern part of the northern side, while a ditch running from the south-west corner may represent an annexe. Some pits are visible within the temporary camp south of the fort. FALKIRK (1) Camelon, Glasgow Road (NS 8640 8072): a large area over the south-east corner of the 'south camp' was evaluated prior to development, with two areas excavated more substantially.50 The larger of these lay east of the Antonine annexe and uncovered a multi-phase field-system of contemporary date. This consisted of a series of overlapping boundary ditches set on two alignments, with pits and a possible cremation burial, all heavily truncated. An earlier phase of large pits, field ovens and a putative timber post-built structure may be Flavian in date. The second area provided a section through the south defences of the Antonine fort. The earth bank of the rampart survived to a height of 1 .3 m and had been modified to insert a front wall of clay-bonded boulders. At the same time the dimensions of the rampart were substantially increased and the inner ditch filled in. This ditch was already redundant as evidenced by a thick layer of peaty material that incorporated much leatherwork, including some 90 shoes. Subsequently the rampart facing collapsed and it appears that a metalled road crossed the area. Further ditches were observed throughout the area of the evaluation, both north and south of this rampart. To the south they include probable Flavian trenches, tying in with those identified by Maxfield,51 as well as the outer ditches of the Antonine annexe. Those to the north suggest a previously unrecognised division of these enclosures. Apart from the stone foundations of a rectangular building near the eastern rampart, only occasional post-holes from internal features were seen. THE ANTONINE WALL FALKIRK (1) Kinneil (NS 9774 8037): (a) excavation52 found no convincing trace of a spur road heading from the fortlet to the supposed line of the Military Way some 130 m to the south,53 and suggested that this latter is actually an eighteenth-century road. It seems more likely that the Military Way ran nearer to the Wall and close to the rear of the fortlet, avoiding the obstacle of the DeiPs Burn to the south, (b) Geophysical survey54 showed that the fortlet had two ditches on the western side but only one on the more defensible east; the terminals turned in at the southern gate.55 49 For the Roman Gask Project by Dr D.J.

Coarseware and mortaria were concentrated in the barracks in the retentura , while samian was found most often in the central range and towards the end of the retentura barracks, around the centurions' quarters. Amphorae sherds were widespread across the fort. (4) Laurieston, 74 and 76 Grahamsdyke Street (NS 9138 7952): an evaluation58 at 74 Grahamsdyke Street found remains of a Roman period turf wall running north-south just behind the Wall, and probably butted against it. Earlier work at No. 76 in 2008 (not previously reported) had found a similar turf feature and a north-south gulley, along with Roman pottery. This is probably part of extensive settlement activity to the west of Mumrills.59 (5) Rough Castle (NS 8431 7991): excavation of part of the Ditch in front of the fort60 showed that its fills had been stripped out and its form modified during drainage work in the 1960s. (6) Castlecary: (a) (NS 7900 7818): excavations61 just beyond the north-east corner of the fort showed that the Wall did not join directly to the corner but lay some 10 m to the south, and probably fitted behind a wing wall. No defensive pits were found on the unusually wide berm, but a spur ditch running north-south between Wall and Ditch cut off access to the fort's northern defences.62 A shelf on the southern lip of the Ditch supported a well-preserved drystone revetment. The upcast mound to the north, of solid clay with traces of stone revetments, showed two phases, suggesting a narrower primary ditch defended the fort before the Wall-building programme reached the area and the ditch was expanded, (b) Allandale Football Ground (NS 7986 7868): a watching-brief53 showed that the upcast mound survived well, though the rampart had been terraced away in the 1920s.

HADRIAN'S WALL By PETE WILSON SOUTH TYNESIDE (1) South Shields fort ( Arbeia ) (NZ 365 679): excavation continued in the same 10 by 17 m area, 20 m south-west of the south angle of the fort, as described last year.72 A ditch terminal, counterpart to that of the outer ditch described last year, was found, projecting slightly from the south-east section and cutting through the roadway found in 2011 heading towards the south angle of the fort, leaving a causeway only 2 m wide. This possibly represents a narrowing of a causeway that originally carried the road through the ditch. The ditch itself showed no tendency to turn around the south angle of the extended fort, so it may have carried on to form the south-west side of an annexe attached to the south-east side of the fort. South-west of the outer ditch were two pits separated by an upstand of clay, through which a channel 0.7 m wide linked them. The north-east pit, cut by the ditch, was rectangular, 2.8 m long by 2 m wide and 0.25-0.43 m deep. The south-west pit was irregular in shape, 4 m long by 1.4-2 m wide and 0.33-0.43 m deep. These pits were associated with some metalworking process - a small metal crucible and the broken fragments of further crucibles were discovered in the fills along with an area of burnt clay in the south-east corner of the rectangular pit. These features appeared to be stratigraphically earlier than the road (and possibly the stone building) ' described last year. They contained pottery which on Hadrian's Wall is no earlier than the mid-third century in date (notably Campanian 'black sand' amphora), suggesting that the road and ditch arrangement might not have come into being until the late third/early fourth century (in contrast to the Seveřan date suggested last year) and that there was possibly still activity in this part of the vicus at that time. The pottery in the ditch indicated that this had remained open until the late fourth century.73 NORTHUMBERLAND (1) Vindolanda (NY 769 663): (a) following on from the 2010 work a fourth season of excavations within the north-west quadrant produced three principal findings which will have a major bearing on the future interpretation of the site. The first is that the original third-century barracks in this area were of a more traditional nature than those encountered in 198074 (fig. 10). Rather than an initial build of or very quick conversion to chalet-type construction as encountered by Bidwell (namely free-standing structures) those in the north-west quadrant were constructed in the more traditional style of earlier periods and were occupied from c. A.D. 213 to c. a.D. 270-278 before being demolished and replaced. In the fourth century the foundations of the earlier barracks were covered in largely free-standing 'chalet'-style buildings similar to those uncovered in the north-east quadrant at Housesteads. 72 See Britannia 42 (201 1), 336-8.

A.D. 213 barracks in the north-west quadrant of the stone fort.</page><page sequence="22">292 PETE WILSON The second discovery was that the bottom of the street between the third-century barracks may have been guarded or adorned by a gateway, raising the question of whether or not there was a 'gated' or segregated community within the fort itself at that time, possibly a detachment of a different unit (other than the Fourth Cohort of Gauls). The physical evidence for the possible gateway consisted of the remains of four responds protruding into the street from either side of the southern barrack rooms, perhaps closing off the junction to the via principalis. The third principle discovery from the fort excavations was the remains of a further nine circular huts, situated directly below the c. A.D. 213 barracks and above the earlier Antonine barracks. These were generally in a poor state of preservation but enough survived to indicate the possible layout of the structures in this quadrant of the fort. It is increasingly clear that the roundhouse period at Vindolanda (Seveřan in date) was very extensive and that buildings were constructed in neat rows of five set out back to back, with room for a street between. The very small quantities of material culture recovered from the circular huts and associated contexts may suggest non-military habitation. Directly below the foundations of the circular huts were the remains of the Antonine fort's barracks. Unlike the later third- and fourth-century fort the Antonine fort was constructed facing south. Each barrack room in the Antonine period was found to have had its own hearth in the middle of the room, a marked difference from the later third-century barracks, some of which were furnished with fireplaces set into the walls adjacent to the doorways into the rooms. (b) Excavations in the extramural settlement focused on the area immediately south and west of the third-century bath-house. Here the foundations of a large mid-second-century defensive stone wall were uncovered that had been constructed on a stout clay rampart immediately to the west of the later baths. This defensive line was re-enforced by a deep ditch on its western side. The ditch and wall were certainly out of use by the time of the Seveřan fortlet (to the west of the circular huts) and the subsequent vicus structures were placed over the demolished/filled in remains.75 CUMBRIA (1) Knockupworth, Beaumont Parish (NY 3720 5688): excavations in 2009 and 2010, in advance of road construction revealed the remains of both the Turf and Stone Walls of Hadrian's Wall, the north and south mounds of the Vallum, and the Vallum ditch. The slighted Turf Wall comprised a shallow, 3.45 m wide deposit of dark sediment, aligned broadly north-west/south-east, truncated by the Stone Wall, which had been built upon it. The latter survived to a maximum of two courses (0.35 m) high, the foundation course consisting of flat, irregular slabs of yellowish-brown sandstone, faced to the south-west, enclosing a clay-bonded rubble core. Three adjacent blocks of a similar fabric, on the Wall's south-western face, were the only remains of the second course of stonework. The Wall survived in two distinct lengths, one being 9.8 m long and the other 2.75 m long. It had a maximum width of 2.7 m, with none of the north-eastern face surviving; this has probably eroded over time into the River Eden, as the Wall was on the lip of a steep cliff down to the river. The Vallum (ditch and north mound) was sampled in two places; the south mound was only encountered at one location, and it was only there that the depth of construction necessitated excavation of the complete profile of the ditch and the sequence of deposits within it. Where sampled the Vallum ditch had a wide, flat, U-shaped profile, and appears to have been approximately 5.8 m wide and 2.7 m deep, although it had been reçut on its south side. The lowermost deposits were permanently waterlogged and predominantly comprised deliberately 75 Directed by Dr A. Birley for the Vindolanda Trust. Dr Birley sent information.</page><page sequence="23">ROMAN BRITAIN IN 201 1 293 backfilled sediments, including a substantial dump of turves which may have derived from the slighting of the Turf Wall or the Vallum mounds. The sections excavated through the north mound produced widely contrasting results, which appear to reflect the level of damage it had suffered. The base of the mound comprised redeposited glacial till (gravel and cobbles). In one of the interventions, the mound was 5.25 m wide and lay 9.25 m to the north of the ditch, whereas, in the other, the edges of the mound were far more diffuse, making the deposit more difficult to define confidently. It appears, though, that the mound was located 6.4 m north of the ditch and was 1 1 .4 m wide, if dispersal by ploughing can be discounted. The possible vestiges of the south mound were also detected as an 8 m-wide deposit of redeposited glacial till, immediately to the south of the Vallum ditch, although this too may have suffered some displacement since its original deposition, or it may in fact represent the remains of a marginal mound. At some point, the Vallum ditch had been reçut on the south by a ditch with a U-shaped profile, and of similar depth to the original ditch. The reçut was at least 4.1 m wide. Initially, this ditch also seems to have seen some deliberate backfilling, with a highly mixed deposit of organic material and clay-silt, containing a single sherd of second-century pottery, presumably providing a terminus post quern for this phase of activity. A period of gradual natural silting followed, represented by a complex sequence of numerous interleaving deposits. It was evident that the uppermost part of the ditch profile had been infilled during the post-medieval period and, in places, deposits associated with the nineteenth-century Carlisle Navigation Canal and the Carlisle and Silloth Railway had obscured its full width.76 (2) Kirkandrews on Eden, Beaumont Parish (NY 3519 5901): a small evaluation trench, in advance of improvements to access on the Hadrian's Wall Path National Trail, revealed the core of the stone phase of Hadrian's Wall. This was located at the lip of the scarp slope above the River Eden, at a depth of only 0.17 m below the ground surface. It largely comprised very roughly squared red sandstone, measuring a maximum of 0.4 m by 0.17m in size. The Wall was over 2 m wide, the south face not being located, but the north face had been affected by the erosion of the river scarp, and the insertion of steps for the Cumbria Coastal Way, so that no facing stones now remained.77 76 Commissioned by Birse Civils Ltd for Connect CNDR Ltd, on behalf of Cumbria County Council.

NORTHERN ENGLAND By PETE WILSON CUMBRIA (1) Kendal area: two denarii, two sestertii and one dupondius from Domitian to Hadrian, also one plated denarius and a, probably Roman, key.78 (2) Maryport ( Alauna ), Camp Farm (NY 038 372): excavations in 201 1 were designed to explore the area where Roman altars were found in pits in 1870.79 The altars have long been considered to have been ritually deposited.80 Truncated traces of timber buildings of beam-slot and post-in-trench construction were found, as was a fragmentary cobble surface. These features were cut by the 'altar pits', of which ten were excavated. One of these was undisturbed by earlier excavators. Like all of the pits, it was 1.3 m square and 1.3 m deep, filled with stone, and a 300 mm square post socket was found in the top. The other nine pits had all been disturbed by previous investigations. Seven of these had been partially excavated by earlier archaeologists who had respected the edges of the pits, partially removing the stone fill. All of these pits retained part of the original fill, and in the bases of all them were greenish stains, 300 mm square. These pits seem to have been some of the 59 excavated in 1870. Two pits retained some 60 per cent of the original fill, having been previously excavated without regard to the original cuts. In these it could be seen that the stone packing in square pits measuring 1.3 m3 was placed around posts 300 mm square, the sockets of which survived, lined with green staining produced during the decay in situ of the posts. In one of these, the corner fragment of an altar was found. This was immediately identified as the missing corner of RIB 823, an altar first recorded by Horsley81 at the Senhouse family seat of Netherhall in 1725 and now in the Senhouse Museum. The void from which the fragment came was of identical dimensions to the altar, which must therefore have been recovered from this pit before 1725. The altar had been re-used as part of the packing for a post. This discovery demonstrates that the story of ritual deposition should now be discarded. The altars were deposited as packing for the timbers of a very large late Roman building (fig. 11). Possibly associated with the pits was a curvilinear ditched enclosure, in the basal fill of which an altar fragment was found.82 78 Found by Mr I. Trimingham while searching with a metal-detector.

Maryport site plan showing altar pits and curvilinear enclosure.</page><page sequence="26">296 PETE WILSON COUNTY DURHAM (1) Binchester ( Vinovia ) (NZ 2102 3134): the third season of the new campaign of excavation took place in 201 1 and saw continued work in both the dextral half of the praetentura , close to the east corner of the fort, and in that part of the vicus lying beyond the south-east defences.83 Inside the fort further examples of the large pits typifying the latest phase of activity were found, in some cases lined with stone and/or clay; one exceeded 3 m in diameter. There was no discolouration of the sides of these pits to indicate their function. Their homogeneous soil fill, along with contemporary deposits over surrounding areas, contained large numbers of cattle bone fragments - principally skulls, jaw bones and hooves. This suggests that the pits, and neighbouring platforms of rough paving, were used for the slaughtering and processing of animal bone (and possibly hides) like the pits found on the praetorium site during excavations in the 1970s and 1980s and dated to the fifth century.84 Another pit cut into the clay of the fort rampart appears to have been used to collect and store water for use in these processes. Further details of the underlying building are emerging with clear evidence in the north-west outer wall of two periods of construction separated by a period of abandonment. Traces of what may have been the original south-east outer wall of the building are beginning to emerge in the intervallum area, giving it a width of c. 11 m. The well-preserved base of a bread-oven set into the back of the south-east rampart was excavated. In the trench outside the fort to the south-east a 40 m-long stretch of the latest surface of Dere Street has been revealed along with the outlines of several buildings fronting onto its north-east side. Lying closest to the fort and immediately adjacent to a side-street surfaced with very large paving slabs was a small, rectangular 'strip-building', measuring 5 by 13 m with walls of neatly dressed masonry. Adjacent to this building and separated by a gap of less than 0.40 m there stood a second building with similar dimensions. Stone-robbing had removed large sections of its walls but even so it was plain that this building was of inferior, and very probably later, construction than its neighbour. A third building continues beyond the confines of the trench both to the east and to the south. Its walls are of superior quality to those of its neighbours both in terms of construction and appointments. Two rooms lay within the trench with a porch-like structure attached to the frontage apparently of later date. Wall-plaster survives in situ within the latter while a patch of waterproof concrete still adheres to the face of one of the walls in the larger room. The interior of each room was fully occupied by a large pit lined with flat stone slabs. Their fill was similar to those of the pits found inside the fort and similarly produced large quantities of animal bone. Immediately east of the trench a depression in the field surface denotes the spot where Victorian excavations uncovered a circular hypocausted chamber.85 This is almost certainly part of the regimental bath-building and the rooms described above seem likely to belong to the same building. Assuming this followed the usual row-type plan and extended northwards, this would explain why the two neighbouring buildings were so small, there being only a narrow strip of ground between the baths and Dere Street. 83 For previous work see Britannia 41 (2010), 361; 42 (201 1), 346. 84 I.A.

It also showed other features which suggest that the amphitheatre may have been re-used as a defensive site in the medieval period.88 For the first time Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) was tested on the site.89 It was used in the churchyard to see whether features from the Roman town could be identified beneath the graveyard. Maps from Eckroyd Smith's Reliquiae Isurianae showed the presence of a possible forum wall to the north of the church. The GPR survey covered the western half of the churchyard, and was successful in identifying earlier walls, which from their orientation and layout appear to be those of the forum.90 (2) Hebden area: 33 silver denarii from Vespasian (a.D. 69-79) to Marcus Aurelius (a.D. 161- 180).91 (3) Kilnsey, Chapel House Wood (SD 975 651): preliminary surveys of this area were carried out by Arthur Raistrick in the mid-1960s and identified a Romano-British hut circle with enclosures and associated fields.92 Detailed field recording has identified significant differences between two main areas of settlement at the heart of the extensive complex of surviving earthworks. The northern settlement area contains Raistrick's 'Romano-British hut circle and enclosures' and is surrounded by a low stone bank around 1.5 m in width. The internal structures themselves are more elaborate than was originally thought, comprising oval or sub-rectangular elements at the ends of two substantial rectangular stone foundations. Pottery from this part of the settlement comprises a small number of Roman fine and coarse wares, mostly heavily abraded. The southern settlement area comprises building platforms on either side of a hollow way, which leads past a single enclosed area containing a sub-rectangular structure. Excavation of the largest platform has revealed a semi-circular or D-shaped faced bank of stones, with the 86 The project is a partnership involving: Durham County Council's Archaeology Section; the Department of Archaeology Durham University (including Archaeological Services); the School of Archaeology, Department of Classics, Stanford University; and the Archaeological and Architectural Society of Durham and Northumberland.

The straight side faces out across the valley and is marked by a line of paving along the break of slope. Finds include a large quantity of domestic animal bone and an Aucissa brooch. The small amount of pottery from this area includes a very thick rim sherd of native ware. Evidence for metalworking includes hammer-scale, fragments of a crucible and splashes of lead. Calibrated radiocarbon dates lie predominantly in the first century b.c. and second to third centuries A.D. respectively, and suggest continuity from the late Iron Age into the Roman period.93 YORK (1) York ( Eboracum ): (a) Heslington East I (SE 641 509): the fourth season of excavation94 identified evidence for Bronze Age activity, including some cremations. However, the majority of activity here belongs to the Roman period and includes significant landscape features such as terracing and boundary ditches, the alignment of the latter reinforced, in one case, with two north-south inhumations. A third- to fourth-century masonry building was set within this landscape, together with a second, timber-framed structure, a cobbled trackway and a 3 m-deep, stone-lined well almost at the summit of Kimberlow Hill, on the southern slope of the York moraine. To the west, a substantial rectangular cobbled foundation, initially revealed in 2008, was investigated further and is now interpreted as footings for a tower mausoleum. Two associated adult inhumations lay just outside this tower structure, with several further infant inhumations in the vicinity.95 (b) Heslington East II (SE 6430 5100): excavation revealed a complex sequence of archaeological features stretching back to at least the Middle Bronze Age and including a small Iron Age farmstead. As at Heslington East I, the majority of features were dated to the Romano-British period, but the area appears to have lain outside the main focus of settlement on the site. Evidence for land management was frequent, with complex re-cut ditched enclosure systems across much of the excavated areas. The excavation also revealed continuing evidence for exploitation of the natural springs, first recorded for the Bronze Age, ranging from rough unlined pits to formal wells. Some of the latter included wattle linings, whilst others employed cobble, clay and timber posts to support the unstable natural sides. The waterlogged conditions provided a rare opportunity within a rural setting for the preservation of organic objects, woodworking technologies and environmental evidence, which are all in the process of conservation and assessment. Two crop-driers were also excavated. Assessment of the pottery suggests the presence of material from the late first century A.D. through to the late fourth or early fifth century, although the majority of activity appears to have taken place in the third to mid-fourth centuries.96 (c) Holgate Villa , Holgate (SE 59507 51315): an evaluation was carried out within an area that has previously revealed burials of Romano-British date.

Much of Area 1 occupied a south-facing slope, formed by successive thick colluvial deposits, beneath and between which were sandwiched separate horizons of archaeological activity: the earliest horizon spanned the early Neolithic to the early Iron Age; the next, the Iron Age and early Roman periods; while that succeeding contained features of Roman and Anglian date, being sealed by colluvium associated with medieval agriculture. At the base of the slope, where the ground was more level and dropped only gradually to the Gypsey Race to the south, colluvium was absent, and features of all phases intercut here; this was also the case in Area 2, which lay on the same relatively level ground. Late Iron Age/early Roman activity was principally represented by several major north-south boundary ditches, around 60 m apart in Area 1 . The partial remains of two roundhouse drip-gullies lay between two of the ditches, while a number of chalk surfaces and pads, and a lesser number of post-holes, are assumed to represent further associated structural activity. A later phase of narrower ditches or gullies on two predominantly ENE-WSW alignments cut across the north-south ditches, extending across the slope in Area 1 and crossing the northern end of Area 2. Contemporaneous isolated burials were recorded in both excavation areas. Pottery recovered was principally locally-produced handmade coarsewares, with smaller quantities of wheelthrown greywares of probable second- or early third-century date and occasional samian sherds. Deposition of a major colluvium was followed by an intensive phase of Roman period activity recorded in both areas. A series of parallel shallow gullies, repeatedly redefined, crossed the slope at the eastern end of Area 1 , repeating the alignment of linears established at the end of the previous phase. On the slope in the centre of the area lay an enclosure, up to 35 m wide and over 50 m long, defined by a series of successive intercutting narrow ditches or gullies; the north-east corner of the enclosure funnelled outwards into a ditched trackway leading to the north. The interior of the enclosure appeared devoid of any structural activity and it may have been for stock. Cutting across the enclosure were a number of successive major boundary ditches, running along the slope for lengths of up to 170 m. The ditches marked the northern extent of a settlement which ran east-west along the lower-lying ground at the base of the slope, with ditched enclosures, and subdivisions thereof, being recorded. While only the very northern edge of this complex of enclosures was recorded in Area 1, in Area 2 the full width of the settlement was transected by the pipeline corridor, here comprising two principal enclosures, 30 m and 60 m across, each subdivided. Structural elements such as post-holes, stone layers and a small stone-lined oven were recorded; while the presence of timber buildings is suggested, no coherent building plan could be determined. Pottery recovered from the settlement enclosures and associated boundary ditches ranged in date from the third century through to the late fourth or early fifth century. Subsequent settlement activity of Early to Middle Saxon date was recorded in both areas. (b) Rudston (TA 1147 6730): small numbers of Roman features, principally boundary ditches, were also recorded in some of the other areas investigated on the route of the proposed pipeline south of the Gypsey Race. Of particular note is a small ditched enclosure in Area 5B, into which had been cut a grave capped by a layer or low cairn of stone.98 98 Fieldwork by J. Fraser and R.

Archaeological features included ditches, pits and post-holes. The post-holes did not form any definite buildings, but appear to represent fences and screens around some of the pits. The majority of archaeological features contained undiagnostic, locally produced handmade pottery, which may have dated to the later prehistoric or Roman periods. Only very occasional sherds of clearly Roman period pottery were recovered, which may indicate that the majority of the handmade pottery was pre-Roman, or that local ceramic sources remained sufficient into the Roman period."

Field-walking and metal-detector surveys in the area of the cropmarks have recovered a few pieces of late Iron Age metalwork and a substantial quantity of Roman coins, brooches and other objects. These finds suggest the presence of a settlement which originated in the later Iron Age, but which was also occupied during the Roman period. Further south, aerial photographs show a curving length of ditch, which may be part of a large ring-ditch of prehistoric date. Geophysical survey of the proposed development footprint has identified a number of anomalies, including a possible double-ditched trackway and some early field boundaries. The evaluation was focused over five areas, with trenches placed to target geophysical anomalies as well as to sample areas without geophysical anomalies. A pit in Trench 6 in Area 3 contained a single sherd of Roman pottery (greyware of second- to fourth-century date) in its fill and the excavation of Trench 8 within Area 2 revealed a hollow-way possibly running towards cropmarks to the west of Sancton Hill Farm.102 (6) Near Selby: 201 silver denarii in two greyware beakers from Mark Antony (32-31 b.c.) to Commodus (a.D. 1 80- 192). 103 (7) Withernwick parish, land between Cowden Lane and Aldbrough Road (TA 2130 4096): following on from geophysical survey, eleven trial excavations were carried out in advance of the proposed construction of a wind farm, Trenches 6 and 10, in the area of one turbine and under the planned sub-station, targeting particular concentrations of features. A small number of features recorded in outlying trenches were potentially of Iron Age or Roman date, though the majority of the Roman features were recorded in Trench 6, where ditches defined an east-west trackway, with contemporaneous enclosures to both north and south. These would have lain on the western edge of a small settlement site, the majority of which extended to the east, outside of the excavated area.

Two fragments of Roman ceramic building material were also recovered. Features representing an early Saxon phase of settlement were recorded in both Trenches 6 and 10. 104 LEEDS (1) Roundhay, Elmete Caravan Park (SE 339 373): an evaluation by geophysical survey105 and trial-trenching106 was carried out on a 7 ha site in advance of its proposed development as a graveyard. The south-facing site, immediately south-east of Roundhay Park, had been terraced when the former caravan park was created. This had resulted in the partial truncation of two square ditched enclosures, one within the other, each defined by substantial V-shaped ditches. The fills of the ditches produced late third- and fourth-century pottery, predominantly Dalesware. The outer enclosure is about 110 m square, whilst the centrally positioned inner enclosure is just 45 m square. The form of the enclosures, coupled with the nineteenth-century discovery of a Roman altar in the area, fuelled speculation that they may represent a shrine. The evaluation findings have not, however, been able elucidate on this possibility.107 KIRKLEES (1) Slack, Outlane (SE 0840 1750): excavations by the Huddersfield and District Archaeological Society (HDAS) in 2007 and 2008 uncovered a complex of conduits designed for carrying fresh water supplies to the vicus area north of the fort and heading directly towards the fort, which is now covered by the local golf club. Parts of the conduit were floored with wooden planking that has been radiocarbon dated to between a.D. 210 and 340. 108 The competent construction of the conduits in stone with overlapping capping stones sealed with clay and their direction towards the fort suggest a military design. This late dating was further supported by some of the pottery finds from the same excavations which include a large proportion of material (especially black-burnished wares) dating to the later second and early third centuries.109 The presence of Crambeck parchment ware and Aldborough white ware dating from the third to the end of the fourth centuries suggests even later occupation at Slack. Cumulatively the evidence suggests that military occupation at Slack may have extended beyond the previously accepted end date of a.D. 120-140, possibly by a considerable period.110 CALDERDALE AND ROCHDALE (1) Blackstone Edge road (SD 9565 1649-SD 9895 1843): a detailed earthwork survey and investigation has been undertaken of the route of the presumed Roman road over Blackstone Edge,111 crossing the South Pennines between Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire.

The position of all the enigmatic central 'gully' stones, kerb stones and other paving was also recorded to determine the road surface's current condition. The survey has identified previously unrecorded lengths of road embankment and terracing along the West Yorkshire section of the road, as well as sections of paving, including central gully stones, of a similar construction to those on the better known western half of the monument. Although previously considered to be Roman, the age of the road has been widely debated and it has been suggested that the visible paving could be the result of the turnpiking of an earlier route. LANCASHIRE (1) Kirkham, No. 38 Dowbridge (SD 43272 31832): a watching-brief was undertaken during groundworks for a house extension.112 The works revealed a continuation of the asymmetric-profiled ditch ( fossa punica ) recorded in 1994 113 and interpreted as the perimeter of the third temporary camp (phase 1.4), dating from before A.D. 117. The ditch was also seen in 2001, immediately adjacent to the 2011 works.114 At the south-west end of the works two shallow linear features with a stony upcast on their western sides were found. These features would lie outside the ditch of the 'Third Temporary Camp', but within the area enclosed by the 'Second Temporary Camp'. It is conceivable that they represent prehistoric agriculture, but a medieval or post-medieval date is also possible. A complete profile of the 'punie' ditch was recorded in the western trench (Trench 2), where it was found to be 7.60 m wide and 2.20 m deep. An 'ankle-breaker' was detected in Trench 5. Samian from the lower fills was of first-century date; the fills also produced a greyware bowl of late first- to mid-second-century date.115 Later ditch fills incorporated re-deposited cremated human bone associated with later first-century samian. Abandonment horizons, which produced mid-second- to early third-century coarseware, also incorporated peda lis, lydion , sesquipedalis , and/or bipedalis bricks, suggesting that a building with underfloor heating had existed near by. CHESHIRE (1) Middlewich, King Street (SJ 7053 6645): a watching-brief at the southern end of King Street, accompanying gas main replacement work, recovered evidence for the principal Roman road running north-west-south-east through the settlement, together with the remains of Roman structures and probable external surfaces. Small, shallow indentations in the natural subsoil, sealed by Roman deposits, may relate to the cultivation of the area. First- to third-century pottery, briquetage and daub were recovered.116 (2) Warrington, Appleton and Thorn (SJ 6374 8374): a small evaluation trench was excavated in advance of the construction of a new front porch to a property lying on the line of the Roman road extending along the southern edge of the Mersey Valley, from Stretton in the west to High Lee and Hoo Green in the east.117 The section affected by the porch is part of a c. 40m-long section designated as a Scheduled Monument, although the trench, which encompassed the entire footprint of the proposed porch, revealed only deposits of probable eighteenth- to 1,2 Work by Mr N.

It was noted that the scheduled section, which was originally designated due to the presence of a raised section of agger , is now much reduced, particularly in the car park immediately to the north-east of the evaluated area.118 (3) Tattenhall, Chester Road (SJ 4872 5860): following an earlier programme of evaluation in 2010, which had indicated the presence of Roman deposits, the site of a new parsonage c. 60 m to the east of St Alban's parish church was subject to a programme of strip, map and record.119 Past observations had suggested that the remains of a Roman building might be present beneath the parish church.120 That part of the evaluation area where Roman features were located was not excavated as it lay within the new garden area and no archaeological features were found within the footprint of the house and garage. It was concluded that any Roman activity extended for no more than 40 m to the east of the church. LINCOLNSHIRE (1) Bourne, Manning Road (TF 1027 2003): evaluation in the area of the Car Dyke Roman waterway and near to previous discoveries of Roman and medieval remains, including evidence of medieval pottery making, revealed a Roman gully and a couple of undated ditches. The western edge of the Car Dyke was tentatively identified, although a nineteenth-century quarry covered a large part of the area. Much of the site had previously been stripped in the 1970s-80s.121 (2) Cowbit, Backgate (TF 2651 1785): trial trenching was undertaken prior to residential development at the site. Evaluation of the site identified remains of Roman, medieval and post-medieval date. The Roman deposits relate to domestic or agricultural activity associated with the nearby settlement. Pottery, animal bone, a triangular loomweight and wall-plaster were among the artefacts recovered. The Roman pottery assemblage would be characteristic of high status dining and if the wall-plaster is of Roman date, a building of some status may lie elsewhere in the vicinity. At the south-west corner of the site Roman deposits are likely to be associated with a small Roman settlement in the adjacent field to the south, first identified during fieldwalking undertaken in 2001. 122 (3) Fenton, Lincoln Road , Torksey Lock (SK 8381 7788): evaluation close to the known Roman pottery kilns and the Foss Dyke Canal, believed to be of Roman origin, which is located immediately to the north. A few ditches, pits and a dumped deposit were revealed; although undated, they were thought probably to be Roman and were sealed beneath an extensive buried soil that contained moderately abundant Roman pottery of second- to fourth-century date, together with a lesser amount of medieval ceramics. There was no clear evidence of wasters among the Roman pottery assemblage, though many of the pieces, including some possible regional imports (black burnished-type and Nene Valley colour-coated wares), were burnt and abraded.123 (4) Lincoln: (a) Lincoln Castle (SK 9739 7175): a programme of evaluation was carried out in the eastern courtyard to assess the nature, date and depth of archaeological deposits in advance of development.

The very earliest strata sampled during fieldwork were those recorded by auger survey which indicated a further c. 0.4 m of archaeology overlying possible bedrock. Only a few sherds of early Roman ceramic were recovered, perhaps suggesting some deposits of this date are or were present near by. This should of course be expected being within the legionary fortress.124 (b) Castle Moat House (SK 7389 7180): topographic survey undertaken as part of earlier evaluation at the site detected a gentle but consistent rise in level flanking the western boundary of the site on the line of the western Roman defences. The evaluation consisted of two trenches measuring 2 m by 5 m, both of which encountered two phases of archaeological activity. The earliest was dated by ceramic and glass to the Flavian period and represented remains of the defences of the legionary fortress. The deposits encountered consisted of limestone-rich make-up considered to represent the remains of the legionary rampart. Two associated structural features were identified as a post-in-trench foundation and a further trench forming structures at the rear of the rampart. The post impressions at the base of the trench suggested timber posts in the order of 0.5 m by 0.7 m possibly spaced at 1 m intervals. Material recovered can be interpreted as deposited during dismantling of the structural features of the legionary rampart, probably during the reorganisation of the defences for the colonia , and as residual having originated from military occupation of the legionary fortress. Comparison with other sites in the city where the remains of legionary defences have been excavated shows the timber posts were significantly larger than those recorded elsewhere. This may indicate the position of a tower which would have commanded long-distance views over the lower city and across the surrounding land.125 The second phase was represented by a stone-built retaining wall of complex construction of late eighteenth- to nineteenth-century date. The wall formalises the difference in level between Hilton House and Castle Moat House; this topography has long been considered to originate in the Roman period since the shared boundary is the line of the western defences. During the subsequent watching-brief the eastern elevation of the boundary wall and footings was exposed revealing several phases of construction potentially incorporating an element of the third-century colonia defences. The banded make-up of parts of the wall footing is reflected in Roman foundation make-up observed elsewhere in the city.126 (c) HSBC Bank, 221 High Street (SK 97519 71224): hand excavation of a 1.57 m by 1.31 m area to deepen an existing lift pit. Two Roman horizons were identified. The lower, extending deeper than 4.1 m OD, was a waterlogged loose silt containing late second- to third-century pottery, roof tile, animal bone and environmental evidence of waste ground affected by periodic flooding and used for refuse and cess disposal. A very different and compacted silt above this, truncated at 4.5 m OD by the previous lift pit foundation, was an accumulation of flood-deposited plant debris and silt, with a superficial appearance of dry peat. This layer produced one sherd of undiagnostic Roman pottery and minute fragments of late second- to third-century date were recovered from a sieved environmental sample. A coin (a.D. 364-378) suggests a late fourth-century or later date - an eighteenth- to nineteenth-century pin and a fragment of twentieth-century vessel glass were discounted as contamination associated with construction of the original lift pit by 1923. The pointed tips of three stakes were recovered from the layer. These are undated but may indicate later activity across the site. This very small 124 Fieldwork by FAS Heritage was directed by J.

This zone, originally within the river foreshore, is believed to have been raised with dumped material during the Roman period and developed by the medieval period.127 (5) Newton-on-Trent, Lincoln Water Treatment Works (SK 828 736): a Roman ditch and oven, from which charred bread was recovered, were found. Geophysical survey suggests that the oven was one of many lying along an earlier ditch line that may have been associated with a nearby Roman fort or marching camp.128 (6) Wragby (TF 132 785; 134 786; 142 783): further field-walking129 has identified three dense scatters of Roman pottery, building material and artefacts located to the north-west, north and north-east of the modern village. The artefactual material indicated that each of the three Roman structures was mainly occupied from the second to the fourth century A.D., with one of the sites producing late Iron Age and first-century pottery. All three of the sites suggest the presence of hypocausts with two possibly containing tessellated or mosaic floors, based on the finds of individual tesserae. The surrounding fields surveyed to the north of the village between the three settlement sites produced abraded Roman pottery and building material indicative of the manuring of fields in the Roman period. At the first site (TF 132 785) the scatter of building debris suggests a large complex of three buildings possibly flanking an open courtyard facing south, with smaller buildings located away from the main complex. The presence of painted wall-plaster, tesserae and window-glass indicates a prosperous villa that is supported with the high quantity of fine pottery and fragmented glass vessel pieces. A small collection of late Iron Age to early Roman pottery is also present within the scatter of Roman finds. The second site (TF 134786) produced a scatter of building debris and pottery which indicated two buildings set at right angles to each other and possibly facing west. The presence of hypocaust material and painted wall-plaster may indicate a bath range on the western limits of the complex. The pottery recovered from this area is dominated by local greywares with the occasional fragment of fine ware and amphora sherd. The third site (TF 142783) produced a scatter of building material indicating a single building on a north-west to south-east alignment, with several dense scatters of pottery to the south-west and south-east that may derive from timber structures. The pottery consists of local greywares with an occasional fine ware fragment. A survey of cultivated areas within private gardens within the village has identified a modest assemblage of first- to third-century greyware pottery and kiln furniture fragments in and around properties in Grammar School Way (TF 1334 7815). The pottery and kiln furniture are all indicative debris from an off-shoot of the Market Rasen potteries situated c.10 km to the north.130 NORTH LINCOLNSHIRE (1) Croxton, Melton Ross Quarry (TA 0800 1230): a programme of archaeological stripping and recording was undertaken prior to tree planting and landscaping adjacent to the A 180. Features of Iron Age and Roman date were found, including ditches, two large quarry pits and a road or trackway. The pottery finds suggest that the site was occupied from the late Iron Age to the later second century a.D. with only slight evidence for later activity. The majority of the features on the site are likely to relate to a succession of agrarian activities. No clear focus of 127 Archaeological monitoring by Mr G.

The metalled trackway discovered running south-east-north-west within a wide hollow was seen through geophysical survey to continue for at least a further 360 m north-west. The line of the High Street Roman road (Margary 270) has been assumed to run along the very straight south-west boundary of this field, following the parish boundary. Previous trial trenching failed to find any trace of this along that line and it seems probable that the trackway identified here formed part of that route.131 5. THE MIDLANDS By PAUL BOOTH NOTTINGHAMSHIRE (1) Everton: 43 base metal radiates to A.D. 270. A nummus of A.D. 319 is probably a stray find.132 DERBYSHIRE (1) Hope, Hope Shale Quarry (East) (SK 17907 82655): on the eastern edge of Hope Quarry, north-west of the confluence of the River Noe and Bradwell Brook, fieldwork subsequent to evaluation identified Roman activity, contemporary with that previously identified to the west of the Roman fort of Brough-on-Noe. Limited dating evidence, fragments of ceramic building material and a fragment of glass from a prismatic bottle of probable early Roman date were recovered from an early ditch, which was subsequently re-cut on a similar alignment. Given the lack of structural evidence in the vicinity and the paucity of artefactual material within the ditches, these features probably represent the definition and redefinition of field boundaries west of the fort. 133 (2) Ripley area: three base-silver radiates to A.D. 260. 134 SHROPSHIRE (1) Shrewsbury area: a hoard of 9,3 15 base-metal radiates and nummi with fragments of a Severn Valley ware pottery container.

Two probable marking-out gullies and a roadside ditch were also noted. Three small fragments of probably Roman tile were found in the metalling.137 WARWICKSHIRE (1) Alcester, 55 High Street (SP 087 574- SP 088 573): two large stone foundations located a little to the south of the predicted line of the fourth-century town wall may relate to a bastion or tower at the southern gate. The site is approximately in the centre of the southern line of defences: the current High Street has long been a contender for the line of a Roman street. A watching-brief during the replacement of an old culvert, including new stretches, and associated manholes, was also able to record several soil layers containing small amounts of second- to fourth-century pottery deep below a narrow passageway on the north side of the HSBC bank. The trench required close shuttering but the top of the larger foundation was exposed at a depth of 1.25 m below the current ground surface and was 5.7 m wide by at least 0.9 m deep. Both foundations were in local Arden Sandstone, perhaps the dominant material used in the town wall. Beneath the foundation a series of piles, probably of alder, survived in situ. These were generally around 0.12 m in diameter and unsuitable for dendrochronology. The larger footing was similar to that found 62 m to the north-east.138 The narrower foundation was also very substantial and could have been a later alteration.139 (2) Bedworth: three Iron Age North Eastern gold inscribed (VEP CORF) staters are additional to a group of eleven gold staters found in 1994. 140 (3) Brailes: two Iron Age gold quarter staters, one of Cunobelin and one of the uninscribed Western series.141 LEICESTERSHIRE (1) Asfordby, site of proposed wind farm (SK 721 210): trial trenching suggested a concentration of late Iron Age and early Roman settlement activity on top of a ridge overlooking the valley. This could represent the continuation of settlement previously identified to the east of the site near to the deserted village of Welby.142 (2) Barwell (SP 436 975): geophysical survey of land west of Barwell identified clusters of anomalies in the southern, central and northern parts of the site. The central group of anomalies, to the north-east of Bosworth House Farm, lay in the vicinity of a series of enclosures identified by Lidar survey and Roman finds recovered during surface artefact collection surveys. Evaluation confirmed the existence of significant Roman activity, mainly concentrated in the western part of the site near the A447, north of Bosworth House Farm. The distribution of features found during the trial trenching generally corresponded with the distribution of geophysical anomalies. The majority of the features identified were sparsely distributed boundary or drainage ditches, although pits, possible post-holes and one severely truncated Roman cremation burial were also 137 Work by P.

The Roman remains appear to date predominantly from the second century, although possibly earlier and later material is present. As well as pottery, the artefact assemblage includes a fragment of window-glass, a single tessera and small quantities of roof-tile, possibly suggesting the presence of a relatively high-status building in the general vicinity.143 (3) Burrough on the Hill, Burrough Hill hillfort (SK 7605 1195): an area outside the eastern defences was examined (Trench 3), while Trench 4 extended work on the main entrance, begun in 2010 (Trench l).144 Trench 3 targeted two roundhouses and a D-shaped enclosure revealed by geophysical survey. The roundhouses were of Iron Age date. The D-shaped enclosure proved to be a two-phased structure with a north-eastern entrance, constructed in the Iron Age but with much Roman pottery from the final ditch silts. Roman pottery and a third-century coin were recovered from a ditch that formed part of a large enclosure to the north of the three structures.145 (4) Castle Donington, Park Lane (SK 436 276): excavation identified truncated ditches and gullies defining a network of probable stock enclosures, droveways and other agricultural features of late Iron Age and early Roman date. In addition, two Roman sandstone quarry pits produced a substantial assemblage of pottery. A small timber post and beam-slot structure on the eastern edge of the site may have been associated with these quarry pits.146 (5) Coston, Coston Hall (SK 8478 2197): excavation identified a pit, post-holes and a gully indicating low density Roman activity within the site. The majority of features dated from the fifth to ninth centuries.147 (6) Enderby, land west of St. John 's (SP 5492 9901): evaluation revealed a series of pits probably dating to the mid- to late Iron Age and the early Roman period.148 (7) Great Glen, land off Stretton Road (SP 6630 9856): excavation in advance of residential development on the southern 2 ha of a farmstead showed that the site was occupied from the later first to fourth centuries. It comprised domestic enclosures and fields which were remodelled on at least three occasions. Evidence survived for five poorly preserved roundhouses and one possible rectangular building, as well as a possible threshing-floor and cobbled farmyard surface. A 'ladder' enclosure system was created during the later second century to the east of the main occupation area. A few late Iron Age and Saxon finds were recovered, but there was no direct evidence of settlement during these periods. Amongst the more unusual finds were a later second-century strap mount with military associations and two iron fragments possibly from styli.149 (8) Hallaton, Hare Pie Bank (SP478 296): geophysical survey and evaluation identified a probable medieval chapel, beneath which was a dark layer containing a substantial assemblage of Roman pottery ranging from the first to the fourth century, as well as two late Iron Age sherds.150 143 Work by D.

Pottery, quern-stones and roof-tile indicating occupation from the second to fourth centuries were associated with two post-holes and a stone spread.151 (10) Ibstock, Ravenstone Road (SK 406 1 13): magnetometer survey one. 10 ha of land east of Ravenstone Road, mapped part of a substantial Roman roadside settlement lying along the course of the Roman road from Leicester to Chester. Several highly magnetic anomalies were thought to indicate the locations of kilns or similar industrial features.152 (11) Kirby Bellars (SK 727 177): geophysical survey provided evidence for the continuation of a known Roman road (Le Střete), as well as settlement to the west and possible quarrying to the south-east.153 (12) Kirby Mallory, land south of Bosworth Road (SK 4377 0922): excavation investigated a series of Iron Age and Roman enclosures revealed during geophysical survey and detected several deep storage pits, one containing a pair of saddle querns. An area of Roman activity on the south-eastern side of the site consisted of ditches, pits and a possible post-hole^eam-slot structure. The activity appears to spread eastwards into Kirkby Mallory race track, suggesting that it represents only a part of a larger complex of Roman settlement. Early Anglo-Saxon evidence was also recorded.154 (13) Leicester (Ratae): (a) land between Braunstone Gate and Narborough Road (SK 578 041): an evaluation adjacent to the 1970s excavations at Great Holme Street, where an early Roman kiln and possible abattoir had been found, detected an early Roman ditch and other Roman deposits.155 (b) Newarke Street (SK 585 040): trial trenching and salvage excavation at the rear of the Elfed Thomas building, De Montfort University Law School, adjacent to a Roman cemetery examined in 1993, revealed disturbed cremation deposits of early Roman date together with a metalled surface, overlaid by a ditch system identified in the previous excavations.156 (14) Lockington, Lockington Quarry (SK 470 280): a watching-brief continued on the area south of the large late Iron Age/Romano-British agglomerated settlement and enclosures (Scheduled Monument: SM 126) and detected a later Bronze Age to Iron Age pit alignment and a probably early Roman linear ditch complex which crossed the site from north to south.157 (15) Lutterworth, Leaders Farm (SP 5302 8423): trial trenching revealed evidence for an Iron Age enclosure and Roman settlement.158 (16) Market Harborough, Lubenham Hill (SP 719 871): evaluation identified isolated enclosures of possible late Iron Age date adjacent to a more extensive complex of Roman settlement spanning the late first to fourth centuries A.D.159 (17) Melton Mowbray, land south of Kirby Lane (SK 7513 1735): fieldwalking located a large scatter of Roman pottery, concentrated in the western side of the field.160 151 Work by J.

Structures included a roundhouse and a number of cobbled yard surfaces. Occupation continued throughout the Roman period and the presence of Saxon spindle-whorls hints at later activity.161 (19) Swinford, Swinford Windfarm (SP 575 815): excavation revealed a sequence of late Iron Age and early Roman settlement in the area of Turbine 4. The earliest features were a series of parallel, east-west ditches dating to the mid- to late first century A.D. and associated with a possible rectangular structure and a roundhouse, the cobbled floor of which sealed sherds of late Iron Age pottery. These features were replaced during the first half of the second century by a series of rectangular enclosures in the southern half of the area, bounded by a substantial ditch to the west, and associated with a second roundhouse destroyed shortly after and covered by a thick layer of charcoal and burnt daub. The latest structure was a substantial stone platform surrounded on its north side by a ditch, dating of which suggested that occupation had ceased by the mid-second century. The activity was on the western edge of a small settlement. The area of Turbine 5 revealed evidence for a probable trackway, heading northwards towards this settlement, and two cremation pits, whilst in the area of Turbine 9, a few further ditches, gullies and pits were uncovered, all of earlier Roman date.162 RUTLAND (1) Empingham, Audit Hall Road (SK 4444 2779): a Roman ditch of third/fourth-century date was superseded by a number of very truncated stone walls, with associated groups of painted wall-plaster and an iron 'T-clamp' suggestive of a hypocaust.163 (2) Great Casterton, Great Casterton Primary School, Pickworth Road (SK 999 092): excavation at the junction of Ermine Street and Ryhall Road adjacent to two previous discoveries of late second- to early third-century pottery kilns revealed part of a third kiln of the same date.164 The fills of the firing-chamber and stoke-pit contained pottery wasters and items of kiln furniture, including the clay lining, kiln bars and fragments of perforated floor. The kiln appears to be of similar form to those previously excavated near by: circular, with a tongue-shaped pedestal supporting radiating kiln bars and a perforated floor, a design shared with those of the much larger industry of the Lower Nene Valley at Peterborough.165 The pottery was also very similar, comprising colour-coated wares of later second- to early third-century date. Amongst the beaker forms represented, was one decorated with a figure very similar to a representation of the god Bacchus found on another vessel from the Lower Nene Valley potteries (fig. 12).166 Also of note were mortaria copying later samian ware products from Central and Eastern Gaul (forms 43 and Curie 21), that have not previously been recognised amongst the output of the Great Casterton or Lower Nene Valley industry. 161 Work by Albion Archaeology.

Forty-five inhumation burials were found within the settlement - 30 of them in a cemetery in use in the late third/fourth century (fig. 13). The graves within the cemetery were positioned adjacent to and parallel to the enclosure ditches. Most burials were supine, although there were single examples of crouched and prone burial. Two bodies had been decapitated with the head placed either between the lower legs or to the side of the lower leg. Three examples of multiple burials within the same grave were identified, despite the overall spacing of the graves and the absence of intercutting which suggested that there was no real pressure on space within the cemetery. In the case of the single 'triple-decker' three coins were found at the base of the grave. Three main types of grave goods were recovered: pottery vessels, coins and animal remains. The most significant finds from non-funerary deposits within the settlement were 200 coins, some possibly associated with a late third-century coin hoard, found in the 1950s, and the right foot of a cast bronze statuette.169 (2) Corby, Priors Hall (SP 9280 9020): a trial-trench evaluation recorded a previously unknown complex of Roman stone buildings and enclosures. One high-status building, a villa, may contain intact floors. Quantities of painted wall-plaster and other building materials were recovered. The other stone buildings lie near by. Metalworking debris indicates that iron smelting was being carried out in the vicinity.170 (3) Daventry, International Rail Freight Terminal (SP 562 755): a third phase of evaluation comprised 147 trenches. Excavated features were largely undated, but one possible trackway ditch produced Roman pottery. The extensive Iron Age and Roman settlement previously excavated to the south does not appear to extend into this area.171 (4) Greatworth, Stutchbury, Spring Farm Ridge (SP 573 432): an evaluation revealed two main areas of Roman activity. One comprised probable enclosures and boundary systems, as well as a series of quarry pits, and appeared to be in use throughout the Roman period. A second area comprised the remains of a Romano-British building of modest status, with associated activity. Pottery associated with the building dated exclusively to the second century, while some of the peripheral activity may have dated to the later Roman period.172 (5) Kings Cliffe: sixteen silver denarii up to Diva Faustina I (under Antoninus Pius).173 (6) Northampton, Overstone Leys (SP 7920 6550): a third phase of evaluation found the remains of a Romano-British settlement dating to the late first to fourth centuries, comprising a number of intersecting rectilinear ditched enclosures. Within the settlement were the remains of at least three roundhouses, of which one was stone-built, and a length of wall that may have been the remains of another building. The artefactual evidence indicates that the settlement was a fairly low-status, rural farmstead with possible field boundaries extending away from it to the west and south. Undated ditched boundaries found in earlier phases of the evaluation may also be remnants of a wider field-system.174 169 Work by M. Luke and M.

These were superseded by a Roman villa with ancillary structures, including a post-built aisled barn with drying oven, two further drying ovens, stone-lined wells and a water cistern. The main buildings were a continuation of the building to the west, partly excavated in 2002. 175 There was a possible metalworking area focused around a stone-built roundhouse. A drovewáy defined by parallel ditches led to a partially metalled ford over the Harpers Brook. The villa, the processing area and perhaps the droveway appear to have gone out of use by the late third century, when a series of ditches, some utilised for animal stock control, was created, and an oven was inserted into the demolition deposits of one of the villa buildings. The site appears to have been abandoned in the fourth century.176 PETERBOROUGH (1) Peterborough, Itter Crescent (TF 182 018): a late Iron Age enclosed settlement and a previously undiscovered Romano-British villa were found (fig. 14). The Iron Age settlement was well established by the first century b.c. and comprised three roundhouse gullies, one of which had been rebuilt in the same location, numerous pits, post-holes and an oven. These lay within a large, banked enclosure ditch. The bank was located on the outside of the enclosure, perhaps suggesting that defence was not its primary function. The enclosure ditch remained in use into the Roman period and the subsequent villa, continually extended and remodelled over a period of 200 or 300 years, was built within it. At least three separate phases have been identified, including an extensive, high-status timber and stone building with a corridor on the western side. A substantial, possibly two-storey stone building and a later bath-house and hypocaust system lay to the south. At its height the villa faced east onto a central courtyard with ranges on three sides (the south range lay beyond the limits of excavation). The western wing housed a possible kitchen and other domestic rooms, with the bath-house and hypocaust system located to the south. A garden wall formed the limit of the northern wing which ran east to west along the line of the boundary ditch and was associated with a large rectangular stone building of possible agricultural function. Despite extensive robbing of the floor surfaces, large numbers of tesserae were recovered from demolition deposits and robber trenches, including multi-coloured pieces from a decorative mosaic. Significant quantities of painted plaster fragments were also present. West of the main villa complex lay a small tile kiln that would have provided roof, floor and box-flue tiles to the villa. Two phases of use were identified, the second of which presumably represents re-use during expansion and modification of the villa. Over 40 individuals were interred across the area. At least three groups of neonate and infant burials were located predominantly within the courtyard area and are thought to be contemporary with the working life of the villa. Many of the adult interments were presumed to be of late Roman or Anglo-Saxon date as they were placed into robber trenches or cut through the floors of the villa rooms and associated buildings. A single Anglo-Saxon burial west of the ditched enclosure contained two gilt brooches and an amber bead and copper-alloy necklace dating to the fifth century A.D.177 175 Britannia 34 (2003), 325. 176 Work by J.

The excavation revealed multi-period remains spanning the Neolithic to modern periods. During the Middle Iron Age settlement activity shifted onto the higher ground in Area C, lasting into the Late Iron Age. It included a possible 'cemetery garden' consisting of two enclosed cremation burials placed in pits along with at least eleven vessels and accompanying grave goods. The cremated bone had been placed in a wooden box. Late Iron Age field-systems and evidence for nearby settlement were also recorded in Areas B and E. Early Roman land use consisted of a pattern of small rectilinear fields and paddocks. A double-ditched, sub-circular late Roman enclosure was recorded in Area F. This yielded no evidence of domestic or agricultural use but the inner ditch contained the disarticulated remains of several adults, along with five late Roman bracelets, large nails and butchered animal bones.178 (2) Hinxton, Hinxton Genome Campus (TL 5442 6092): excavation corroborated earlier investigations in the locality, revealing the continuation of Iron Age and Romano-British agricultural activity in the form of extensive boundary ditches, enclosures and a fence-lined trackway that may have been used for animal husbandry. The pottery from previous excavations forms a regionally significant group of 'Belgie' material and indicates that the wider settlement was of unusual status. A single burial of possible Iron Age or Roman date was placed within a ditch. Occupation of the site appears to have diminished during the late Roman period.179 (3) Soham, Gimbert Road (TL 5912 7368): an evaluation and excavation revealed a number of north-west-south-east-aligned parallel ditches towards the east of the site. The ditches yielded pottery of late Iron Age and first- to second-century date, whilst the faunal assemblage showed a predominance of sheep/goat bones, suggesting that the agricultural system initially established during the Iron Age was still utilised in the Roman period.180 BEDFORDSHIRE (1) Bedford, water main (TL 1424 4772): investigations in advance of construction of a short length of the Bedford water main to the west of the Kempston Church End settlement181 revealed a boundary ditch and a cremation burial to the west of Cemetery Road. The cremation burial was in a small grave adjacent to the boundary and contained fragmentary hobnails and the remains of seven timber nails. The latter are small and so not from a coffin; they may have been from a wooden container for which no other evidence survived. Similar burials were found nearby on the Biddenham Loop.182 (2) Leighton Buzzard, land at Clipstone (SP 950 270): a second phase of evaluation was carried out on a site proposed for mineral extraction. Previous work had demonstrated the presence of two areas of late Iron Age/early Roman settlement, one in the northern part of the site and one extending into the southern part. The current evaluation confirms this general pattern, and also located some evidence of outlying field boundaries to the east of the northern settlement. Later Roman pottery was found in a ditch close to the southern settlement. Ceramic building material was also found.183 178 Work by T. Philips of Oxford Archaeology East. E. Popescu sent information.

A small cemetery, in use from the late Iron Age (early first century a.D.) to the early second century a.D., was fully excavated. It comprised some fifty urned cremation burials in shallow pits, typically accompanied by a number of accessory vessels, and a single inhumation burial (fig. 15). A boundary ditch system of the same date respected the location of the cemetery. An excavated area to the east of the Ml was crossed by a series of Roman boundary ditches spanning the first to second/third centuries. A single pit contained a little burnt bone and quantities of dark soil, charcoal, burnt stones and burnt clay that may have come from a pyre.184 FIG. 15.

The first phase, dated to the later first to mid-second centuries a.D., was represented by six cremation burials recorded in an eastern central part of the site, each accompanied by at least one ceramic vessel, and a dog burial and a possible post-hole. The features were interpreted as part of a roadside cemetery to the north of Roman Stane Street, the line of which was recorded during excavations at 133 Stansted Road. The second phase of activity, broadly dated to the third and fourth centuries, comprised a small pit, a quarry pit, and a series of boundary ditches on north-south and east-west alignments, probably defining agricultural enclosures.185 (2) Buntingford, St Bartholomew's Church, The Causeway , Layston (TL 36940 30110): an excavation recorded re-used Roman building material within the foundation walls of the late Saxon/early medieval predecessor of the present church, and large quantities of contemporary tile, brick and box-flue within the consolidation layers above the foundations. The building materials were dated to the mid-first to mid-third century and suggest the presence of a substantial Roman building nearby.186 (3) Hertford, land at St Johns Street (TL 3298 1290): an excavation revealed two Roman pits and a post-hole sealed by post-medieval ploughsoil.187 (4) Puckeridge, Mentley Lane East (TL 3858 2367): following evaluation a further phase of excavation recorded evidence of an extensive early Roman cremation cemetery and a number of later Roman inhumation burials, as well as associated boundary ditches, mortuary enclosures, pits and post-holes. In total, over 200 cremation burials and 60 inhumations yielded well over 480 complete and partial vessels and a number of other important artefacts such as shale bracelets and many hob-nail shoes.188 (5) St Albans, Westminster Lodge Leisure Centre (TL 1443 0652): a watching-brief identified a boundary ditch and a ditched enclosure which contained occupation and building debris.189 It is possible that both ditches served as leats associated with a masonry building previously identified to the north-east of the site and which may have been a mill during this period.190 (6) Watton at Stone, Station Road (TL 2980 1908): an evaluation and excavation revealed two extensive Roman ditches, dated to the third century, interpreted as the boundaries and entrance-way into a field.

This activity continued at least into the second century, the latest pottery being dated c. a.D. 120-200.192 (2) Cuddington, Holywell Farm (SP 7565 1 160): evaluation in advance of proposed development revealed ditches and pits which covered a relatively flat area on the crest of a north-facing slope. The ditches probably formed boundaries of a Romano-British farming complex which occupied this hilltop from the second to the fourth century. Settlement evidence came from a series of post-holes, a gully and waste pits close to the boundary ditches of the farmstead. Most of the ditches contained a mixture of both early and later Roman pottery within the fills. A large (possibly defensive) third- to fourth-century ditch aligned approximately north-east-south-west may indicate reinstatement of the boundaries of the farm. This ditch contained some Saxon and post-medieval pottery on its uppermost surface. Other features also contained Saxon pottery.193 (3) Fleet Marston, Wayside Farm (SP 7797 1596): two phases of controlled metal-detecting survey and excavation of test pits showed a concentration of material around the still extant church of St Mary, with the volume of finds decreasing significantly away from the church. The majority of dated finds from both phases of metal-detecting survey, including a range of copper-alloy and silver coins, came from the later Roman period. Some metalwork dating to the Saxon and medieval periods was also recovered. The test-pits contained a range of pottery dating from the Roman into the post-medieval period.194 (4) Slough, George Green (SU 996 808): evaluation in advance of proposed mineral extraction revealed a potential later prehistoric trackway, along with sparse evidence for prehistoric activity in the northern half of the site.

Iron Age features were overlain by a series of early Roman deposits, including up to seven gravel surfaces of a possible road aligned north-east- south-west.

The ditch is considered to be associated with the nearby late Iron Age Grim' s Ditch, which survives as an earthwork in the unploughed field.198 (3) Chilton, Chilton Fields (SU 4814 8600): a large Iron Age roundhouse was directly overlain by a small structure (4.5 m square) associated with a larger building, 10 m by 4 m, with chalk and flint foundations on a north-west-south-east axis. These buildings were in turn succeeded by a north-east-south- west-aligned hall-like structure, 15 m by 8.5 m, with foundations of chalk, flint and sarsen. Two identical small rooms, each 6 m by 2 m, were placed symmetrically on the long axis of the building, one projecting at the south-east corner and one at the north-west corner, and appear to be integral with the main structure. A double row of large post-holes outside the south-west wall of the building may indicate the location of a verandah. Further post-holes probably formed a fence defining a courtyard. A small structure to the east was probably contemporary with the main building. This comprised a deep stoke-hole with an arched flue heating a cell with a raised floor c. 1.8 m square. Once out of use this structure served as a rubbish dump and finds from it included large quantities of painted plaster. The main building is of second- to fourth-century date. It is not yet clear if the earlier structures represent continuous activity from the Iron Age through the early Roman period.199 (4) Didcot, Great Western Park (SU 51 90): excavation in advance of major housing development showed that a late Iron Age/early Roman field-system extends over a large area between SU 5039 9079 and SU 5078 9110 at the base of the slope/valley edge on the north-west side of the development area towards higher ground to the south-east. On the high ground a roughly north-south-aligned trackway was traced from the northern edge of the site to SU 5108 9057, which almost certainly links up to a small villa further south.200 The trackway had its origin within the Iron Age and was redefined numerous times. Third- to fourth-century pottery was recovered from the later sequences. East of the trackway at c. SU 510 905 and adjacent to the Stephen Freeman School were several Roman 'fields'. These redefined or enlarged earlier Iron Age enclosures. Associated features included a couple of trackside inhumation burials, a cremation burial and wells with late Roman material in the upper fills.201 (5) Dorchester-on-Thames: (a) 24 Manor Farm Road (SP 5067 1076): a watching-brief during groundwork revealed Roman pits and a compacted surface with an overlying Roman occupation soil of immediate post-conquest date at the rear of the property. At the front of the property observations revealed further pits, gullies and a post-hole, all of early Roman date, with a large quantity of first-century pottery from the fill of a pit in the service trench. It is likely that this area was part of the extramural Roman settlement of Dorchester, not previously thought to have extended this far east of the town.202 (b) Wittenham Lane (SU 578 938): excavation in advance of house construction revealed an east-west-aligned ditch, north of which lay at least 20 west-east inhumation burials, probably of later Roman date.203 (6) Oxford: (a) Sandford Road, Littlemore Mental Health Centre (SP 5330 0234): a watching-brief subsequent to evaluation revealed a late Iron Age-early Roman ditch, a late first- to second-century pit, and a later ditch.204 (b) Rose Hill (SP 5358 0365): a watching-brief 198 Work by P.

Two Roman pits were cut into the upper fills of the Iron Age ditch indicating that the earlier earthworks had ceased to exist by the second century A.D. Most of the later Roman ditches do not appear to respect the lines of the earlier Iron Age ones. A pottery kiln was of a similar design and construction to one excavated close by at Annesley Road,206 although slightly smaller. The stoke-hole, to the east, was partly truncated by modern activity. Pottery associated with the kiln was of late third- to fourth-century date and included some types not previously recorded at this site. (7) South Leigh, Gill Mill Quarry (SP 375 077): evaluation of a 44.5 ha area of potential extension to Gill Mill Quarry, subsequent to a geophysical survey,207 revealed limited evidence for probable field boundary ditches of later prehistoric and early Roman date. To the west (SP 369 079) a roughly rectangular area of c. 1.7 ha in Area 13 of the present quarry contained scattered features, almost entirely of early Roman date. The most coherent features were two small rectilinear enclosures, roughly 25 m apart. The first, in the centre of the site, measured c. 1 7 m by 15m and was aligned approximately east-west, while to the west the second, less regular in plan and slightly smaller, was aligned north-west-south-east. Each had a single entrance roughly in the centre of the short axis, facing west and north-west respectively. There was no significant evidence for interior features and both enclosures may have been for stock. More extensive but discontinuous arrangements of ditches and gullies and a few pits lay mainly to the south-west and north of the two enclosures. These features, mostly very shallow, suggest further enclosures and possible field boundaries, while a modest finds assemblage suggests the presence of at least some domestic activity on or close to the site. At SP 388 066, an area of c. 3.1 ha at the south-eastern extremity of the quarry (Tar Farm 6) was subject to strip, map and sample excavation ahead of gravel extraction. This area contained a dense spread of features indicating continuous activity on the fioodplain of the River Windrush from the middle Iron Age through to about the middle of the third century a.D. Three phases of middle Iron Age activity covered a roughly SSW-NNE-aligned zone extending at least 160 m from the south-west margin of the site and perhaps defined on its eastern side by a more-or-less continuous but irregularly aligned series of ditches. Occupation of the late Iron Age/early Roman period, notably absent from the major second-century and later settlement focus to the north around Gill Mill itself,208 overlay the Iron Age features. It comprised an extensive series of irregular enclosures and other ditches, again with some indication of domestic activity, although specific building locations were, as is usual in this region and period, difficult to identify. In the early second century these enclosures were in turn superseded by a more integrated layout of approximately rectangular enclosures and minor trackways, linked to a major trackway which ran the entire length of the north-east margin of the site (a distance of 260 m) and is known to continue further to the north-west. The evolution of this trackway was complex, its boundaries including numerous reçut ditches and also localised alignments of posts, and it seems to have been long-lived - its broad alignment being mirrored by that of the present-day Cogges Lane which runs along the edge of the valley floor in this area. Evidence for buildings in the second century is again extremely scarce. The best-defined structure was a small but substantial four-post gateway associated with a late (possibly early- mid-third-century) reworking of part of the enclosure/subsidiary trackway layout. Waterlogged post bases survived, and were of beech rather than oak. Other features included small linear clusters of pits. 205 Work by John Moore Heritage Services directed by D.

This clearly did not derive from a structure on the site, but perhaps suggests the presence of a high-status early Roman building in the vicinity. The pottery assemblage also includes small quantities of early Roman imported fine wares which are very unusual in the context of rural settlement in the region, but these are probably earlier in date than the tile and their significance is not yet clear. At SP 385 065 a further area of the quarry (Tar Farm 7), amounting to just over 1 ha and centred some 250 m west of Tar Farm 6, was also examined. This area was separated from Tar Farm 6 by the Hardwick Brook, a tributary of the Windrush, and had a significantly different pattern of use. The earliest feature was an irregular roughly north-south-aligned palaeochannel, apparently an early course of the Hardwick Brook, located in the south-east corner of the site. This was cut by the NNW-SSE-aligned ditches of a trackway, running perpendicular to and south from the line of an ENE-WSW-aligned ditch which crossed the main part of the excavated area. No features were recorded north of this ditch, but to the south in the western part of the area was a group of small ditched enclosures roughly laid out in relation to it, and also including a discrete rectangular enclosure, c. 16 m by 15 m, very similar to those from Gill Mill Area 13 described above, but with entrances in both narrow sides. Only very small quantities of finds were recovered from any of these features, which may all relate to aspects of stock control. The pottery consisted almost entirely of a single common fabric which has a later first- to third-century date range, but it is possible that all the linear features here (except the undated palaeochannel) were entirely of second-century date.209 (8) Wendlebury: a hoard of 63 silver denarii and 26 aes in a greyware jar was found in 2000.

A rectilinear ditch system included a series of parallel ditches ranging from 5 m to 15m apart and, at one point, four small parallel gullies 2 m apart. This layout was superseded by a single large enclosure ditch, and to the north-east of this two shallow natural hollows which were the focus for a range of irregular pits of late Roman date. This area was subsequently levelled up with a layer of gravel over both the pits and the enclosure ditch. A fired clay oven base was also found. Despite evidence of a substantial early Anglo-Saxon settlement within a few hundred metres, only one sherd of post-Roman pottery was recovered.219 (5) Hemingstone (TM 14 53): a probable villa site was subject to magnetometer survey and subsequent trial excavation. The survey showed enclosure ditches, possible areas of building debris and an aisled building. Excavation on this building revealed shallow footings defining the outer wall of the building, with much re-used building material. Fourth-century pottery was found within the structure. A coarse tessellated floor was located within the main area of building debris.

Excavations at Wixoe revealed part of a Roman 'small town', established in the mid- or late first century A.D., probably as a result of its location at the junction of the River Stour and the routes of at least two major Roman roads. During its early phase of development the occupied area was divided by function and these distinctions were maintained even as activity on site increased throughout the early/mid-second century and into the third century. Three roads, tentatively identified as routeways towards Long Melford, Icklingham and a minor internal route, were recorded. Other features included sections of two cobbled courtyards, at least seven post-hole and/or beam-slot domestic buildings, numerous quarry, storage and refuse pits, and a fourth-century town boundary ditch. Industrial activity was attested by the presence of ovens and hearths that contained evidence for copper, iron and lead working. Finds of particular interest included part of a pipeclay figurine of a ram, found within one of the ovens. A bone pin decorated with a carved dog currently has no parallel. Two human burials with grave goods were also recorded.

Cut into the fill of the dyke's ditch was a hoard of 1,247 base-silver/copper-alloy radiates in a greyware flask. An empty flask of the same form (CAM 281) had been buried upright and intact close by. It may have held a recovered hoard, or been buried as a reserve container for additional coins. The latest issues are of Victorinus of A.D. 269-271. 232 Other significant remains at Hyderabad were two ring-ditches surrounding late Roman burials. Similar ring-ditches close to the Arena Leisure Centre (500 m to the west) excavated in 2004 contained late Roman cremation burials, but the 2011 examples surrounded late Roman inhumation burials with spears and shields.

Three Roman layers were seen beneath the topsoil on the extension site, and a Roman stone wall footing was discovered on the boarders hut site. This was at right angles to the Roman street to the north, and may have been part of a structure such as a tomb or small building fronting onto it. A large quantity of Roman-period finds and debris was recovered, including fragments of vitrified kiln or furnace lining, light slag and burnt tile, which indicate some industrial activity in the Roman period on or near the site.235 (f) Former CBC depot, Jarmin Road (TL 9978 2594): machine excavation of a series of test pits in advance of proposed residential redevelopment was monitored. An evaluation in 2007 recorded two Roman ditches and a Roman pit, and two probable Roman features were revealed in the south-western part of the site in 2008. There was a spread of fragments of burnt daub and Roman brick/tile across the site, probably derived from a nearby Roman tile kiln; such a kiln was found within the depot in the 1930s.236 231 Work by D.

A later addition to the Sheepen Dyke should cross the school site, and a large late Iron ditch was found to the east of the school in an evaluation in 2009. Monitoring of the installation of new classrooms, and of a sewage pumping station and associated pipes on the western side of the school, revealed sparse residual Roman finds. The projected line of the dyke as shown by the evaluation should have impinged slightly on the pipe trench, but was not seen. Excavation and watching-brief in advance of the construction of an extension exposed the Sheepen Dyke. To the west of this were two parallel early Roman ditches, which probably formed a trackway. Other features were sparse, but one pit had a quantity of Sheepen-type pottery, probably dating to the early first century A.D.237 (h) Northern Growth Area Urban Extension (TL 986 279): geophysical survey, fieldwalking and trial-trenching were carried out on the 110-ha NGAUE site. The only significant Roman feature was a pit containing sherds from at least fourteen vessels.238 (i) North Primary School, John Harper Street (TL 9919 2584): excavation of five test pits to the west of the school revealed made ground to a depth of 600 mm sealing Roman deposits with second-century pottery, tile and oyster shell. One test pit contained a Roman mortar wall foundation or floor 1 m below modern ground level.239 (j) Sixth Form College, North Hill (TL 9925 2545): a two-trench evaluation of the site in Insula la, in the north-west corner of the Roman town, identified demolition layers (Roman brick, roof-tile, mortar, opus signinum and pottery) probably related to the demolition of a Roman building in the early to mid-third to fourth century. Nothing was revealed during a subsequent watching-brief on three boreholes.240 (k) Town Wall House , 4 Baikerne Hill (TL 9925 2502): a 22-m stretch of water main was replaced south of Town Wall House and across the line of the scheduled Roman town wall. However, it was evident that the present ground surface is actually below the level of the base of the town wall foundation. This indicates that 'old' ground level no longer exists, the ground having been severely reduced in level at some time in the past. There were no archaeological remains or finds.241 (1) University of Essex (TM 0242 2424): a watching-brief on the new, 40-acre 'Knowledge Gateway' development at the University of Essex recovered nearly 500 sherds of late Iron Age and Roman pottery, many derived from disturbed burials.242 (m) Upper Castle Park (TL 99922 25434): the laying out of the new play area and associated infrastructure was monitored.

A gravel surface coincided with the expected line of the east-west Roman street on the southern edge of the insulae. A wall foundation was also recorded in an area where a Roman building had been previously identified (Colchester Building 215). A red tessellated floor was identified in section in the northern entranceway to the VAF. The floor is previously unknown and is from a Roman building (Colchester Building 220), perhaps a town-house.244 (o) Williams &amp; Griffin Stores , 147-155 High Street (TL 9950 2525): seven test-pits were excavated to ascertain the depth and level of survival of archaeological deposits, and four geotechnical boreholes were monitored. The store coincides with Insula 19 of the Roman town. Roman remains (including a mosaic pavement) were overlain by an average of 2 m of post-Roman deposits, and appear to have remained largely undisturbed. It is probable that other Roman buildings will survive beneath the existing store, including tribunes' houses in the first-century fortress.245 (2) Great Easton, Brown's Garage , Dunmow Road (TL 6101 2542): excavation ahead of the construction of a new workshop and showroom revealed a large Roman double ditch, most likely to be an enclosure ditch surrounding an area of habitation. There was a possible palisade on the outside of the enclosure. To the west, a V-shaped Roman ditch may have defined the eastern edge of a trackway. Refuse pits and a series of square, possible latrine pits were located within the enclosure.246 (3) Southend-on-Sea, 160 Priory Crescent (TQ 87815 87590): evaluation revealed residual Roman tile and charred remains of spelt wheat, probably of Roman date, likely to have been associated with a settlement near by.247 (4) Stansted area: two 'Gallo-Belgic' Aa class 4 gold staters. Gallo-Belgic A staters were struck in the Somme valley area of North-West France. Class 4 staters are relatively rare as British finds, with just three or four others securely provenanced, all from South-East England. The present examples are quite light and thus were probably in circulation for several decades before they were buried.248 (5) Steeple Bumpstead: a silver siliqua of Honorius, mint of Milan, A.D. 395-402.249 (6) Tendring district: eight Magnentian base-metal nummi, a.D. 350-353, additional to earlier discoveries.250 244 Work by A.

GREATER LONDON By PAUL BOOTH CITY OF LONDON (1) St Bartholomew's Hospital Regeneration Project, Phase II, blocks along southern edge, Little Britain, Giltspur Street, EC1 (TQ 3193 8148): following work in 2010, an excavation was undertaken in one trench with a simultaneous, rolling, site-wide watching-brief. The site was heavily truncated by hospital buildings. Natural London Clay was observed sealed by sands, gravels and brickearth. Cutting the brickearth was an east-west-aligned Roman ditch containing pottery dated from the second century A.D. and later, with at least two smaller re-cuts running parallel to and 9 m north of the City ditch. Later fills of the ditch also included residual Roman material.251 (2) Walbrook Square (Bucklersbury House), EC4 (TQ 32540 81000): an evaluation trench outside the building envelope of Bucklersbury House, Walbrook, directly adjacent to that building's basement wall and over the easternmost known extent of the temple of Mithras, revealed surviving structural remains of the temple. The eastern wall of the main temple structure had been demolished down to its foundation during the construction of Bucklersbury House, although the foundation was left in situ. The remnants of walls which are often referred to as parts of one or more phases of the narthex were also present within the trench up to a maximum height of 5.84 m OD (modern pavement level being at 10.79 m OD) (fig. 16). Unexpectedly, the evaluation established that Professor Grimes, who directed the 1954 excavation, had returned to record a new trench in 1956. This later trench and parts of the 1954 cutting were emptied out and recorded in detail. Very little new excavation of Roman deposits was undertaken, given the goal of preservation in situ. The Roman deposits were sealed by deep deposits of dark silty earth. It is expected that analysis of the finds and data recovered from this evaluation will provide noteworthy refinements of our understanding of the temple site. During the course of the evaluation, five exploratory shafts were dug to the north of the temple site, outside the Bucklersbury House building envelope in Walbrook and Bucklersbury. A sequence of clay floors of possible Roman date and displaying evidence of burning was observed in the side of the Bucklersbury House construction cut at approximately 6.5 m OD. The information gleaned from these shafts will also help to inform future work on the site. 251 Work by T. Braybrooke and R.

MoLA archaeologist cleaning the north wall of the narthex to the Temple of Mithras at Bucklersbury House, City of London. The wall appeared in the section of a trench that Professor W.F. Grimes excavated after the main temple was discovered in 1954. (© Museum of London Archaeology) A second evaluation was carried out on the south-east side of the site to inform the propose4 pile positions for the new development. The trenches were excavated to a specified level of J pi OD, and further excavation will follow at a later date. Pit 21, along the eastern side of the site on the Walbrook frontage, contained Roman demolition deposits below modern rubble. The upper Roman strata were observed at 5.80 m OD. Below the demolition was a north- south-aligned linear cut lined with timbers, possibly a drainage feature. Pit 23, to the south of Pit 21, contained Roman demolition rubble at a level of 6 m OD. Below this was a series of internal floors and occupation layers, separated in the centre by an east-west beam-slot, denoting a wall division. This building was on top of Roman dumps and make-up, largely consisting of CBM and other building material. In both trenches the archaeology had been truncated by Victorian basement foundation piers. A further phase of work along the Walbrook frontage involved enabling works for large sheet piles to be inserted for a large open area excavation to take place later in 2012. Here it was necessary to hand excavate an area of archaeology in advance of concrete being broken out. A complex sequence of Roman timber structures was excavated, with a first-century building running north-south through the centre of the trench. This was seen at c. 4-5 m OD. It was constructed from large oak piles driven into the Walbrook valley sides with planks nailed to the eastern face, on which a large oak sill-beam had been placed. The internal area was to the east of this wall, to the west was an external area delineated by a timber pale fence running north- south along the western side of the trench area. This was associated with another timber fence</page><page sequence="60">330 PAUL BOOTH running east-west along the southern side of the building. All dating for this was A.D. 70-100. Excavation halted at 3.30 m OD, although it will continue at a later date. The lowest deposits observed were reclamation and dumping layers in the Walbrook valley.252 (3) Camomile Street Dropshaft, EC3 (TQ 33226 81429): a single dropshaft was excavated at the western end of Camomile Street adjacent to the junction with Bishopsgate Street, a short distance north of the projected alignment of the Roman City Wall. A 2 m-deep sequence of Roman deposits was identified in the base of the dropshafl. The lowest of these contained pottery of a.D. 70-160. This was overlain by a layer which included pottery of A.D. 250-400, a small piece of human skull, and a fragment of painted wall-plaster. Residual Roman pottery, an early tessera and another fragment of wall-plaster were recovered from one of the overlying medieval layers.253 (4) Eldon Street dropshaft, Eldon Street, EC2 (TQ 32872 81721): a dropshaft was excavated on the south side of Eldon Street just west of the junction with Wilson Street. In the base of the shaft alluvial deposits (probably infilling a channel or stream) were dated to the second century a.D. These were overlain by Roman deposits of similar date containing disarticulated human bone from at least two individuals and the remains of a Roman burial vessel. It is possible that these remains had been washed into the channel. Comparable remains have been located a short distance north-west of the site at Finsbury Circus (site code ENS03).254 (5) 5-7 Giltspur Street, EC1 (TQ 31805 81500): residual Roman pottery and a fourth-century coin were recovered from barrel wells of probable medieval date.255 (6) Bath House, 60 Holborn Viaduct, EC1 (TQ 32620 81530): a series of Roman pits located in the northern part of the site contained pottery provisionally dated to the late first to mid-second century A.D., with the most important groups being of early to mid-second-century date. These consist of a concentration of flagons and a selection of drinking beakers, possibly associated with the Roman cemetery known to exist in this area.256 (7) Houndsditch dropshafts, Houndsditch (North of Heron Tower), EC2M-EC3A (TQ 33266 81462): excavation of seven dropshafts and a drain heading was monitored in the pavement and road area north of the newly constructed Heron Tower. These located a series of dumped deposits, mostly dating from A.D. 250 onwards, suggesting that deposition occurred after the construction of the nearby City Wall and ditch which lay south of the site. Some disarticulated human remains were found within these deposits, providing further evidence of the eastern cemetery of Roman London which is known to include this area.257 (8) Cheapside/Old Jewry dropshafts, EC2 (TQ 32554 81150): excavation of two dropshafts was monitored. One on Cheapside just east of the junction with Old Jewry contained over 2 m of Roman stratigraphy.258 The earliest deposits dated to the period A.D. 50-80 whilst those at the top of the sequence were dated a.D. 350-400.

This wall contained a piece of Roman building material but stratigraphically is probably not earlier than the late fourth century a.D. and may even be medieval in construction. The watching-brief was particularly rich in finds. A small but noteworthy assemblage of early Roman glass included a glass cup with a decorative frieze depicting gladiatorial combat, provisionally dated to c. A.D. 50-75. At least four gladiators are represented and the most complete fragment shows . . .VS matched against BVRO. . ., with the latter raising his hand in what may be a gesture of surrender. Also found was part of a fine amber free-blown glass vessel of a form unparalleled in London, which may be an exotic early import. Other finds included an almost complete stamped mortarium with a probable counterstamp of Oastrius.259 (9) Lime Street, Fenchurch Avenue dropshaft , Leadenhall Place , EC3 (TQ 33183 81048): excavation of a single dropshaft was monitored on the west side of Lime Street opposite the junction with Fenchurch Avenue. Although truncated by an existing drain, a horizontal sequence of Roman deposits was observed, containing pottery of first- to mid-second-century date.260 (10) 52-56 Minories, EC3 (TQ 33682 80920): a watching-brief located a single Roman chalk burial in a small area of survival between the sixteenth-century quarry pits in the centre of the site.261 (11) Centurion House , 24 Monument Street , EC3 (TQ 32930 80720): investigations at the site in 1981-2 under the site code PDN81 had revealed substantial remains of the early Roman riverfront port, an early timber structure associated with London Bridge and other Roman buildings, including an apsidal-ended bath, parts of which were left in situ beneath the current Centurion House.262 Prior to redevelopment of the site, an evaluation and watching-brief were carried out. This work included the monitoring of three geotechnical test pits at basement level and two archaeological test pits in the basement and lower ground floor. Test pits 1-4 contained timber revetting and/or masonry wall foundations relating to the first-century A.D. Roman riverfront port. The revetments form part of a late first-century landing-stage, while the masonry foundations are remnants of open-fronted storage buildings or horrea. Test pit 5 contained Roman demolition or rubbish dump deposits of second-century date. Although no evidence was found for the apsidal bath building, some of the debris in this test pit may have been sourced from it or adjacent structures.263 (12) 8-10 Moor gate, 3-4 Kings Arms Yard, 8-10 Telegraph Street and 16-17 Tokenhouse Yard, EC2 (TQ 32708 81346): a trench was excavated in advance of the construction of the façade retention tower and crane base in a light- well to the rear of 8-10 Moorgate. This lies c. 2m west of a trench excavated in 2010. Natural sand and gravel were cut by either shallow quarry pits or erosion features on the edge of a tributary of the Walbrook stream. These features had been backfilled and sealed by dumping/ground-raising deposits. In the north-east of the trench, these deposits were cut by a structure consisting of vertical planks held in place by small stakes. Although this was so heavily decayed that its exact method of construction could not be determined, it probably represents a small fence or enclosure. This was overlain by a dumped layer which in turn was cut by five timber posts or piles. Two were located to the west of the 259 cf. Hertfordshire Archaeology 5 (1977), 139. 260 Work by A.

These may have supported base-plates which have since been robbed out. Associated with this possible building were thin floor and occupation layers. A further deposit of silt and gravel raised the ground to the level at which it was horizontally truncated by foundations of the present building. The remains found in this trench are probably related to those found in the north of the 2010 trench and date to the late first or early second century A.D.264 (13) Queensbridge House, Upper Thames Street, Huggin Hill Lane, Little Trinity Lane, EC4 (TQ 32282 80841): an evaluation was carried out to clarify the survival of structural remains relating to the Huggin Hill baths - a large masonry building complex that occupied rising ground overlooking the river to the north of what is now Upper Thames Street. These remains, now a Scheduled Ancient Monument, were discovered and archaeologically investigated in 1964 and 1969 (under the site codes GM80 and GM240) prior to the construction of the present building. The 2011 evaluation was carried out in a service yard off Little Trinity Lane and revealed that the Roman remains have survived well beneath the modern concrete and underlying rubble infill. The remains included walls and floors which could be correlated with the original excavation plans. Preservation elsewhere may be more variable, since the deep foundations of Ocean House (which lies to the north of the site) were exposed during the evaluation and it is known that there are partial basements beneath Fur Trade House (to the south).265 (14) Three Quays House, Lower Thames Street, EC3 (TQ 33350 80550): Roman timber waterfront structures were constructed across the site, from west to east, mostly in the northern third. These are related to those found on the adjacent site to the west, Old Custom House (CUS73), currently occupied by Sugar Quay House. Preliminary dendrochronological dating suggests that construction occurred from the late second to the mid-third century. The chalk raft and oak piles forming the foundation of the late third-century riverside defensive wall were revealed in several shafts towards the northern part of the site, the date of which has been confirmed by a dendrochronological sample taken from one of the piles. Timbers found further south of the main construction area may represent jetties, mooring posts and the like. Copious amounts of stamped and decorated samian ware were recovered from a single site-wide deposit associated with the late second-century quay.266 (15) 10 Trinity Square, EC3 (TQ 3345 8080): excavation of four geotechnical test pits was monitored. In one, a sandy silt deposit contained first- to second-century pottery, including samian ware, as well as roof-tile and ragstone fragments. The other test pits contained re-deposited Roman material including pottery, fragments of roof-tile, mortar, painted wall-plaster, opus signinum and tesserae.267 (16) Crossrail : Finsbury Circus, EC2 (TQ 3286 8158): an evaluation trench in Finsbury Square gardens and a watching-brief on geotechnical trial trenches in the surrounding roadway revealed natural Thames terrace gravels and sand cut by three features. One, a possible quarry pit, contained a fragment of roof-tile dated to a.D. 50-160. The other features, a small pit apparently cut by an east-west-aligned ditch, were undated but may have been broadly contemporary with the quarry pit.

Fragments of black burnished ware found on the site are interesting given the site location within the western extent of the northern Roman cemetery, as they could have originated from disturbed burial vessels. The features were overlain by a sequence of deposits representing the Moorgate Marsh, which formed at some time after the second century a.D. Residual Roman finds were recorded throughout the marsh sequence, perhaps indicating the truncation of Roman deposits. These layers were sealed by sixteenth- to seventeenth-century reclamation dumps and later deposits.268 (17) Crossrail : Moorgate shaft , 91-109 Moorgate, EC2M (TQ 32702 81619): four evaluation trenches and three boreholes in the basement of the building revealed natural gravels and brickearth overlain by a clay make-up layer containing pottery dated A.D. 120-200. This layer was cut by a single undated pit which was sealed by a dump deposit containing pottery dated a.D. 150-200. Overlying these layers was an organically rich clay silt deposit identified as the late Roman or medieval Moorgate Marsh.269 (18) Heron Plaza, former Stone House and Staple Hall, EC2/3 (TQ 33280 81500): natural brickearth was cut by two post-holes, a pit and shallow ditch. These were sealed by a layer of redeposited brickearth. All contained Roman pottery dating after a.D. 120. A ditch of probable Roman date cut the redeposited brickearth layer. The ditches were probably boundaries or part of a field-system.270 (19) 5-7 St Helens Place, Bishopsgate, EC1 (TQ 3243 1372): several phases of watching-brief have monitored the excavation of geotechnical test pits within the ground level passageway in the space between the medieval north wall of St Helen's church and the existing basement of 5-7 St Helens Place. The earliest deposits are probably Roman in date and appear to consist of dumping and pitting. The deposits, which were recorded underlying numerous medieval masonry foundations and layers associated with the nunnery of St Helens Bishopsgate, were not excavated. Five evaluation test pits were excavated. ATP4, at the north-east corner of the church, was located to provide information regarding a Roman boundary ditch previously recorded at the Baltic Exchange site (BAX95) and revealed a deep-cut feature which may be this ditch, together with a small fragment of London-made roofing tile or brick and an imported tegula of A.D. 140-300. Another deep-cut feature was recorded in ATP1. Excavation of ATP5, on the west side of the site, revealed sub-soils of early and mid-Roman date (a.D. 120-140); these are of interest as they are likely to relate to activity along the street frontage of Ermine Street (now Bishopsgate) and indicate wider localised survival.271 (20) Gresham Street : thirteen completely illegible dupondii/asses, a copper-alloy disc, and two pottery sherds, from two other vessels, within an amphora of Cam 186C form.272 CAMDEN (1) Plot B3, King's Cross Central, Goods Way and The Boulevard, NIC 4 AH (TQ 30056 83329): a watching-brief recovered first- to second-century brick, tegulae and daub from a levelling layer. 268 Work by S.

Two parallel ditches, up to 1.6 m wide and up to 0.42 m deep, were probably dug in the earlier second century and a third broader, shallower ?modified natural gully to their north was also open at the time. The middle ditch contained significant proportions of vessels and part of a late Iron Age vessel suggesting ritual activity. It and part of the northern feature were filled and the southern gully partly silted when a possible bank up to 3 m wide was constructed. This was replaced, perhaps in the mid/late second century, by a surface flanked by an informal track on the north. As elsewhere at the south end of the settlement, all activity ceased after the second century and the area developed a deep later Roman hillwash or possibly cultivation deposit.274 HAVERING (1) Harold Wood Hospital, Gubbins Lane, RM3 (TQ 5420 9035): a strip, map and sample exercise revealed extensive linear and curvilinear ditches, a small number of pits and some possible post-holes. The finds seem to indicate continuous activity from the late Bronze Age to the early Roman period, as early forms of Romano-British pottery were recovered.275 SOUTHWARK (1) Oakmayne Plaza (formerly Elephant Road), SEI (TQ 32138 78937): three evaluation trenches were excavated. A 2 m-wide north-east-south-west-aligned ditch was recorded running across the whole site and was probably both a field/property boundary and a drain. Two sherds of an Oxfordshire white ware mortarium (a.D. 240-400) were recovered from the fill. The east end of another potential Roman ditch was also observed.276 (2) Guy's Hospital : Roman boat, Great Maze Road, SEI (TQ 3283 7989): following work in 2010 which uncovered part of the Roman boat lying in the Guy's Channel,277 two trenches were excavated in the areas to the east and south. A sequence of fluvial deposits, the earliest of which may have been contemporary with the boat, was recorded in the eastern trench, but no Roman remains were found.278 (3) 405 Old Kent Road, SEI (TQ 33854 78222): natural sand and gravels were cut by two probable quarry pits.

This is similar to material found to the north of the site at the former Southwark Sorting Office (SWN98) and suggests that a Romano-British settlement may have been present in the immediate vicinity. These remains were overlain by an undated sandy silt layer which probably represents a change in land use after the second century a.d. and may date from either the later Roman or medieval periods.281 (6) New London Bridge House, 25 London Bridge Street, SEI (TQ 32820 80230): following work in 2010, excavation of the basement area was completed. A series of Roman sand and gravel extraction pits was backfilled by large quantities of domestic pottery and bone. A period of ground consolidation was followed by the construction of second-century masonry buildings. The continuation of the building seen in 2010 was revealed at the west end of the site, with the addition of a small building to the south. Towards the centre of the site a series of east- west-aligned chalk wall foundations bordered a mortar floor with three stacks ( pilae ) of a hypocaust. A north-south-aligned wall had been robbed out. In places the wall foundations were supported by wooden piles driven into the base of the foundation trench. Between these two areas was excavated a large area of chalk cobbles overlain by mortar and fragments of a tessellated floor.282 (7) Borough Thameslink Viaduct : (a) 2-4 Bedale Street, SEI (TQ 3255 8027): a series of investigations revealed dump and levelling deposits along the northern margin of the site. These deposits were truncated by two cess/rubbish pits whose fill contained several sherds of Roman pottery, whilst a further pit, provisionally dated to the Roman period, cut natural deposits along the southern edge of the site, (b) Borough Market, SEI (TQ 3248 8027): a watching-brief recorded a sequence of early Roman dump/levelling layers and ground consolidation cut features below two north-west-south-east-aligned flint rubble foundations. Potentially associated with the Roman structural remains were brickearth surfaces/bedding layers, a fragment of mortar surface/bedding layer, and an area of concentrated burning which could represent the remains of an internal oven or hearth. Roman demolition deposits sealed the structural remains and further demolition deposits in the near vicinity may indicate the presence of a second building, (c) The Wheatsheaf Pub, 6 Stoney Street, SEI (TQ 3256 8020): earlier Roman deposits and features comprised a series of levelling dumps and occupation horizons along with structural remains disturbed by later Roman demolition and construction. These included the heavily truncated and poorly preserved remains of a clay-and-timber building comprising a brickearth partition sill and floor. The base of an amphora had been set into the latter, perhaps for storage or as a latrine. This was sealed by a substantial poured and tamped mortar floor surface which was probably internal to a sizeable building. Later Roman features included a robber trench and two parallel, partially robbed, poured mortar and rubble 279 Evaluation by A.

Whilst it is possible that they comprise parts of a single building, subtle but marked differences in their construction suggest that they belong to two separate buildings. A series of post-holes inserted into the eastern wall probably formed part of a succeeding building which extended east from this point. A hearth or furnace sunken into floors associated with the western of these foundations might be contemporary with this building phase.283 (8) Whitstable Day Nursery, Stevens Street, SEI (TQ 3342 7941): a further phase of excavation recorded a possible agricultural horizon containing Roman pottery and tiles. The only Roman features comprised a tiny segment of wall in the western area of the site and two north-west- south-east-aligned possible building foundations in the central and eastern areas. These had been significantly affected by robbing perhaps of late Saxon/early Saxo-Norman date. The site appears to have been heavily quarried during that period, although Roman finds recovered throughout the archaeological sequence include large quantities of building material in the form of brick, tile, tegula , imbrex , box-flue, opus signinum and painted wall-plaster. Pottery and a substantial number of fourth-century coins were also retrieved, whilst among the other finds was a hand from a small bronze statue of a 'Genius' holding a patera. Roman activity on the site began in the second century a.D., whilst peaks in the dated material occur at A.D. 100, 150, 250 and during the mid-late fourth to early fifth centuries.284 (9) Former Abbey Street Children 's Home, Abbey Street, SEI (TQ 3345 7936): an excavation recorded an east-west-orientated Roman gully/ditch below a layer of Saxon ploughsoil.285 TOWER HAMLETS (1) Tobacco Dock (Parcel 4), 130-162 The Highway, El W2 (TQ 3475 8070): an excavation recorded probable Roman quarry pits along the northern strip of the site as well as external surfaces, post-holes, post-pits, ditches, probable rubbish pits and a timber-lined well. A notable find from a group of pits in the northern part of the site was a number of lead rings possibly representing weights. In the south-west corner the fragmentary remains of a clay-and-timber building were encountered. These structural features included probable floor surfaces, traces of walls, post-holes and the partial remains of a masonry-built oven or furnace. Other Roman features in the south-west sector included external surfaces, pits, boundary and drainage ditches, and a well preserved timber-lined well. An important find from this part of the site was part of a stone funeral monument. The small finds included a large number of late Roman coins.286 WALTHAM FOREST (1) Ching Brook Flood Alleviation Scheme, Wadham Road, E 17 4HS (TQ 3784 9130): a watching-brief recorded a possible alluvial deposit to the south of the Ching which yielded fragments of residual Roman pottery indicating Roman activity in the wider area.287 283 Work by J.

A relatively large quantity of residual Roman ceramic building material, as well as a few pottery sherds, was recovered from later deposits. The material had probably been brought to Thorney Island during the early medieval period for the purpose of land reclamation.288 8. SOUTH-WESTERN COUNTIES By PAUL BOOTH GLOUCESTERSHIRE (1) Bourton-on-the-Water, Cotswold School (SP 1663 2109): excavation exposed Iron Age to Roman features, including approximately 240 pits and post-holes, 6 ditches and 21 inhumation burials. The earliest remains included a late Iron Age/early Roman ditch which appears to be a continuation of that investigated during the 2010 New Sports Hall excavation. A parallel ditch contained an Iron Age inhumation and further Iron Age human remains were found within a cemetery comprising at least 16 Roman inhumations. Adult males and females, juveniles and infants were all represented and it is likely that the full extent of the cemetery was not exposed. Burials in stone cists, a shroud and coffins were all present and one adult male was buried with a coin in his mouth, whilst another was possibly encased in gypsum or plaster. Limited evidence was also found of the Roman settlement previously identified during the 2010 excavation.289 (2) Cirencester, former Bridges Motors Garage, Old Tetbury Road (SP 0193 0177): a watching-brief and subsequent excavation during construction of a new car park identified 70 inhumations and 4 urned cremation burials. The site lies within the Bath Gate cemetery, close to the projected (primary?) line of the Fosse Way. Burials have been recorded on the adjacent Cattle Market site from 1867 onwards, and work on this site itself in 1960 (then known as Oakley Cottage Garden) by Richard Reece recorded at least 46 cremations and 6 inhumations under salvage conditions.290 In the current work the cremations, apparently the earliest burials, were disturbed by several of the inhumations. The cemetery was probably defined by a ditch running parallel to the projected line of the Fosse Way, before turning to run perpendicular to it. Within the corner of this cemetery boundary, a robbed wall defined a probable mausoleum which contained seven of the inhumations, one of which was associated with second- to third-century pottery. Other possible cemetery features, including a path and possible tree/shrub locations, were implied by the layout of the graves, although no physical traces of these survived. Possible family burial plots were present, and one such group included a juvenile buried with a copper-alloy cockerel with enamelled decoration and a small pottery tettine or feeding bottle, and another juvenile buried with shale or jet jewellery and two copper-alloy bracelets or shroud fastenings. The closest parallel for the cockerel is an example from Cologne, thought to date to the second century a.D., and both are 288 Work by P.

Approximately 30 per cent of the burials included hobnails, 15 per cent had some manner of grave goods and the majority were within wooden coffins. Most burials were extended and supine, although prone and flexed examples were also present. An indication of the longevity of the cemetery was provided by intercutting graves. The earliest finds suggest that burial began during the late first/early second century A.D., whilst the presence of at least two decapitated burials suggests that the cemetery continued in use into the late Roman period.291 (3) 'Cotswold area': a Severn Valley ware cremation urn with 11 base metal radiates and an associated painted New Forest vessel with 1,435 radiates, the latest being issues of Probus (a.D. 276-282).292 (4) Gotherington: an early uninscribed 'British QC' gold quarter stater and an uninscribed western 'Dobunnic B' silver unit, deposited in the late first century b.c.293 (5) Kempsford, Arkell's Land (SP 181 993): a total area of c. 15.7 ha was excavated in advance of gravel extraction in five phases from 2006 to 2011. 294 This revealed a Roman settlement and associated trackway and fields that form part of an extensive contemporary landscape, parts of which had previously been excavated at Coin Gravel, Thornhill Farm and Claydon Pike.295 Two main phases of early Roman (late first- to early second-century) features were identified near the northern edge of the excavation area. The earlier phase comprised ditches of a probable rectilinear enclosure. This was cut across on a north-east-south-west alignment by a boundary ditch, itself of several phases, which extended just over 100 m into the area from the north. Fragmentary curvilinear ditches of two discrete ?enclosures were also assigned to the early Roman period. The site was comprehensively reorganised during the first half of the second century. The earlier features were swept away and the excavation area was bisected by a ditched trackway, which extended on a slightly circuitous ENE-WSW alignment for 220 m before petering out. A settlement was established on the northern side of the trackway, in the area that had been occupied by the early Roman rectilinear enclosures and boundary ditch, and the remainder of the site was divided up by linear features, while two outlying enclosures were situated at the western and south-western limits of the site. The area south of the trackway was enclosed by ditches to form a complex of approximately rectilinear fields. These had been re-arranged on at least two occasions, on slightly varying alignments, although the predominant orientation was generally north-west-south-east, parallel to the trackway. The south-western enclosure was isolated (though perhaps originally accessed by the ENE-WSW trackway). It was slightly trapezoidal in plan and aligned north-east-south-west, measuring at least 42 m long, while its width tapered from 33 m at the north-eastern end to 24 m at the edge of the excavation area. The enclosure was defined by a ditch with a fence line along its inside edge, represented by 56 stone-packed post-holes. 291 Work by J. Wright and C. Bateman of Cotswold Archaeology. J.

The part of the trackway ditch that formed the boundary of the settlement was reçut, with an apparent emphasis on the entrance itself, but along the rest of the length of the trackway the ditches were allowed to silt up. The part of the settlement west of the entrance was either abandoned or retained in its middle Roman arrangement, but a sequence of enclosures was constructed in the eastern part; successively an oval enclosure with an associated L-shaped ditch, a larger, more rectangular enclosure, then an arrangement of three rectangular enclosures of differing sizes with an open area to the north-west. The final phase comprised a linear boundary ditch and a single rectangular enclosure. At the northern edge of the site a large L-shaped ditch extended beyond the limits of the excavation to north-west and north-east and corresponded with features already recorded at Coin Gravel. Further west were elements of a possible larger double-ditched enclosure, perhaps abutting the trackway on the western side of the settlement. The majority of the pits scattered around the settlement were of late Roman date. These included features 0.75-1.0 m deep that may have served as waterholes before being used for the disposal of domestic refuse. No new features were established south of the trackway during this period, and it is likely that the fields that had been laid out during the middle Roman period remained in use unaltered. The finds reflect a settlement of relatively low status, while the environmental material suggests an emphasis on pastoral agriculture, consistent with the low-lying topographical setting and the evidence from adjacent sites. (6) Lydney, land South of Lakeside Avenue , Tutnalls (SO 6420 0240): excavation exposed a rectangular Iron Age/first-century A.D. ditched enclosure and elements of an associated field-system. The enclosure contained post-holes, stone-filled pits and two possible graves, although the latter produced no human remains. The enclosure was remodelled during the second century, with areas of cobbling and post-hole construction added.296 (7) Stoke Orchard: an early uninscribed 'British QC' gold quarter stater and an uninscribed western 'Dobunnic B' or 'Dobunnic C silver unit, deposited in the late first century b.c.297 (8) Winchcombe, Greet Road (SP 0276 2923): evaluation identified a Roman trackway and possible Roman agricultural or settlement enclosures.298 BATH AND NORTH-EAST SOMERSET (1) Bath, Bath Abbey (ST 7512 6475): evaluation within and immediately adjacent to the south side of the medieval abbey and to the east of the south transept identified possible evidence of a Roman podium associated with the Roman baths to the south-west. To the east of the south transept, quantities of residual Roman pottery within medieval deposits suggest extensive disturbance of Roman levels during masonry robbing and/or sand and gravel extraction.299 DEVON (1) Bideford, Atlantic Array onshore cable route and substation (SS 411 278 to SS 500 251): evaluation along the route of an onshore cable trench associated with the proposed development of the Atlantic Array Offshore Wind Farm off the north Devon coast comprised a total of 36 trenches, targeted on features identified by a previous geophysical survey.

The ditches, although unexcavated, produced considerable quantities of artefacts (including a possible tessera) from their upper fills, indicating a third- to fourth-century date and suggesting a small Romano-British farmstead. The features lie on a low but well-defined promontory of higher ground extending from the south.302 (b) Former Gerber Juice Factory , 78 Wembdon Road (ST 28925 37215): features related to a Romano-British settlement were recorded in the central-western area of the site. They comprise an unlined well, an undated pit, and two lengths of Roman ditch, and are located on what appears to be a topographic high point, with the distinctive Wembdon clays sloping off towards the north and north-east. In these lower lying areas little material was found, and the homogeneous sandy and silty clays may have been marginal and prone to flooding. Pottery from the south-western part of the site dated to A.D. 250-400, while an assemblage in the upper backfill of the well covered the period A.D. 150-250, although the sherds were very abraded and may have been deposited later.303 (2) Frome, Frome IL eleven silver siliquae, additional to an earlier find,304 with a closing date of c .

Combined with geophysical surveys undertaken in the 1990s, a near complete archaeological map of the internal character of the hillfort is now available. The survey enhanced the context of the previously known Roman villa307 in the eastern extremity of the hillfort, indicating that it is surrounded by a complex series of enclosures with a substantial quarried area to the north-west which, although as yet undated, may have originated in the Roman period. 300 Work by V.

Small featureless body sherds in a range of grog-tempered fabrics located in graves, ditches, a post-hole and a tree-throw hole are likely to be of late Iron Age or early Roman date but in the absence of diagnostic material cannot be more precisely dated. The mere handful of small abraded Roman sherds (south-east Dorset black burnished ware and sandy grey coarsewares) indicates that this area lies well outside the zone of first- to fourth-century activity.309 9. SOUTHERN COUNTIES By PAUL BOOTH WILTSHIRE (1) Axford and Ramsbury (SU 2694 7144-SU 2675 7138 and SU 2294 6990-SU 2215 6937): a missing section of the Roman road from Silchester and Bath has been traced between Peaked Lot, north of Hungerford, and Fyfield Down, west of Marlborough, along the Kennet valley. It had been recorded by Leman c. 1800 but then forgotten. To the west of Ramsbury a well preserved agger, 9 m wide, survives unploughed in the water meadows. It has been damaged by transverse drainage channels and water erosion but survives for 190 m as a substantial embankment after emerging from the garden of Westfield House and before converging with the modern road. Between Axford village and the site of Cunetio at Mildenhall further lengths of agger, up to 13 m wide with side ditches, survive unploughed through the water meadows.310 (2) Bromham (ST 965 654): an evaluation comprising six trenches revealed pits containing waste material from iron smelting, boundary ditches, a possible well and part of a substantial wall. The presence of smelting waste at the southern end of the site and of the wall and potential well in the north suggests that the site contains two distinct areas of activity, industrial in the south and domestic in the north, the two areas being separated by boundary ditches. Dating evidence from Trench 1 was predominantly early Roman and some late Roman pottery came from Trench 3. Other contexts could only be assigned a generalised Roman date. The fresh condition of the slag, coupled with the presence of large charcoal fragments and pieces of very hard, fired clay hearth lining from the same contexts, suggests that a furnace lies within or close to the evaluated area.311 (3) Cricklade, Kingshill Recycling Centre (SU 1151 9248): evaluation identified over 30 ditches, eight pits and two post-holes.

A further area of Roman activity was located in the south of the site. Pottery of second- to fourth-century date was recovered.316 (7) Stapleford, Druids Lodge Polo Club (SU 0952 3926): excavation and watching-brief were targeted on concentrations of features identified during earlier phases of fieldwork.317 Area 1 contained a length of trackway and a later sub-square mortuary enclosure. A single burial, located at the centre of the enclosure, was dated to the later Roman period. Area 2 targeted an area of intercutting trackways and linear features, which were dated to the Roman period and were related to the north-western enclosure. Area 3 was located close to the north-western enclosure, and investigated a complex area of intercutting pits and a linear ditch. The watching-brief revealed a Roman unurned cremation burial located to the east of Area 3. The majority of the features were dated to the second to fourth centuries.318 (8) Swindon, Roves Farm (SU 206 889): geophysical survey at the proposed site of a solar farm identified significant archaeological features, comprising an enclosed settlement adjoining a ditched trackway, and a smaller area of possibly open settlement to the north-west. The settlement areas were to be preserved in situ , and an evaluation concentrated on defining the limits of these areas and obtaining dating evidence from the trackway.

The earliest recorded features are of mid- to late first-century A.D. date; pre-Flavian pottery (including terra nigra and regional wares), clay 'gridiron' fragments and a stone column fragment may hint at a military presence in the immediate vicinity. The relative concentration of first-century a.D. material in Dorchester has been thought to reflect a military presence, close to a crossing of the River Frome, though structural evidence for this has yet to be discovered. The very small number of features of early date recorded in Trenches 1 and 2 suggests settlement (with post-built structures and pit digging) and boundaries associated with agricultural or horticultural activities. The fieldwork recorded two later Roman (third- to fourth-century) masonry structures overlying traces of timber buildings.326 (2) Whitechurch Canonicorum, Higher and Lower Coppice (SY 4085 9629-SY 3900 9608): the course of the Roman road between Dorchester and Exeter through the Blackmore Vale has been confirmed by Lidar imagery that shows the agger of the road running for 2 km through woodland and pasture west of Blackmore Farm (fig. 17). Some surface traces and quarry pits survive along the line here in pasture but are insufficient alone to prove the course of the road. The additional evidence for an aligned agger from the Lidar imagery proves that these are the remains of the Roman road. After passing through Loders and Bradpole, and then skirting the high ground of Coppet Hill north of Chideock, the road turns slightly south of west at Blackmore Farm and is aligned on Wootten Fitzpaine. The course then follows Monkton Wyld Lane and Woodbury Lane to the site of the Roman fort at Woodbury Farm, Axminster.327 FIG. 17.

The ditches were up to 1.8 m deep and 2 m wide and an entrance was identified on the northern side. The enclosure originated in the middle to late Iron Age, but was partly reçut in the early Roman period. Finds from the late Iron Age phase included fragments of a probable Dressel IB amphora. Late Iron Age and early Roman features were located outside the enclosure on all sides but there were few internal features. Later Roman activity was indicated by very small amounts of pottery.328 (2) Chaddleworth: a sestertius, two radiates and 131 nummi closing with Theodosian issues (a.D. 387-402).329 HAMPSHIRE (1) Bishop's Sutton (SU597 307): excavation on a suspected Roman estate road330 appearing on an aerial photograph showed that the natural clay on slightly sloping ground had been levelled to a width of 24 Roman feet and overlain with light metallings of crushed flint and finally chalk, moving successively northwards to give a total width of 40 Roman feet. Beyond the northern edge of the chalk layer was a packed flint revetment or agger 14 Roman feet wide and 0.4 m thick. Two reçut ditches were also seen.331 (2) Chawton, Chawton Park Wood (SU 678 371): a 'zig-zag' surveyed in 20 04332 is thought on the basis of aerial photographic evidence to be part of road connecting to the system at Bishop's Sutton (see above). Excavation at SU 669 365 found a large ditch corresponding to one of the probable roadside ditches shown on an aerial photograph.333 (3) Newton Valence: eight silver denarii closing with issues of Diva Faustina I and Faustina II (under Antoninus Pius).334 (4) Silchester ( Calleva Atrebatum) (SU 64 42): the fifteenth season of excavation on Insula IX saw excellent progress made in uncovering evidence for the occupation of Calleva in the late Iron Age and earliest Roman period, up to the episode of destruction associated with the period of the Boudican revolt of A.D. 60/1. Perhaps most importantly, a complicated sequence of late Iron Age occupation is emerging, stretching from the cutting of a major boundary or defensive ditch, which runs some 40 m north-west-south-east across the trench, from c. 40 b.c., to the development and expansion of an internal grid of streets and lanes up to the Roman invasion of a.D. 43. Dense occupation begins from c. 20 b.c. with the establishment of a north-west- south-east-oriented street, the first buildings and the associated digging of rubbish pits and wells.

The most substantial of these is more than 20 m in length and 10 m in width and it produced a foundation burial of a dog identified by Dr K. Clark as belonging to a toy breed, a very rare find of this date. A second building measured about 9 m by 5 m. A subsidiary lane at right angles to the first and oriented north-east-south-west was established sometime after c. A.D. 20. The season produced more evidence for Claudian military occupation in the form of finds of arms and armour and in evidence for the imposition, perhaps limited initially to the line of the north-south street, of what eventually developed into the rectilinear Roman street-grid oriented on the cardinal points. The short-lived military phase of no more than about five years duration was followed by the return of dense civil occupation represented by at least eight or nine timber buildings across the excavation trench. While the majority are rectangular in ground plan with distinctive clay floors, there are at least two round, or D-shaped houses. Two of the rectangular buildings relate to the north-south street and seem to have functioned as tabernae. In the largest building, perhaps the predecessor of the first town-house of the late first century a.D., was found the bronze figurine of Harpocrates, originally the foot of a Campanian drink-warmer, the first to be found in Britain.335 (5) Winchester ( Venta Belgarum ), The Square (SU 48152 29397): a watching-brief during works to replace surface water sewer facilities revealed a high level of disturbance and truncation through post-medieval and modern activity, with limited archaeological deposits of Roman date below. Two sections of Roman wall were discovered, one possibly associated with a building fronting onto a pre-cursor to Great Minster Street, slightly to the east of the modern alignment, and the other within the area of the forum of Venta Belgarum. Three main areas of Romano-British features were observed along the eastern section at the junction of Market Lane and Market Street. A small section of a Roman tile and mortar wall/foundation was consistent in construction and alignment with other structural elements uncovered during excavations c. 50 m to the east and interpreted as part of the forum complex. The dimensions suggest that this was an internal wall, but its distance from other known walls in the area means that it is not possible to incorporate it within a building plan. Approximately 20 m to the south-west and within the Market Street section of the pipe trench, a large dump deposit of Roman brick and crushed mortar was recorded at a depth of 1.0 m from the modern ground surface This appeared to form a destruction deposit possibly related to ground clearance in advance of later construction. The brick layer was situated above a charcoal-rich deposit which could be interpreted as the top of the undisturbed Roman or post-Roman layers, 1.50 m below the modern ground surface. The third observation was made in the western section of the pipe trench, running along The Square towards Great Minster Street. A substantial wall/foundation was recorded aligned with the trench and associated with a possible dark earth deposit. The wall was constructed of roughly shaped flint nodules in a yellow mortar matrix and measured c. 2.5 m in length and survived to a height of c. 0.4 m (1.10-1.50 m below the modern ground level) continuing into the unexcavated deposits below the bottom of the pipe trench. No finds were recovered from the deposits surrounding the wall, but its construction and alignment indicate that it is likely to be broadly contemporary with other structural elements previously excavated in the area of Market Street. Within the main section of the trench along The Square the extrapolated street grid of Roman Winchester proposes two north-east-south-west-aligned roads as crossing this section.

The survey covered a small, privately-owned arable field some 180 m east of the villa, adjacent to the modern developed area of Morton. Earlier magnetometer survey in 1994 on the adjacent Oglander Trust-owned land to the west had indicated a complex of ditch-type anomalies defining field boundaries, enclosures and trackways extending to the boundary of the newly surveyed field. A continuation of these linear features was confirmed, revealing that settlement activity, starting in the very early Roman period before the establishment of the villa, potentially extends for a distance of over 250 m east from the excavated villa ranges. The overall survey coverage at Brading (started in 2009 and concluded in 2011) indicates that the principal villa structures occupy a focal point in an arrangement of linear boundaries and roadways with adjoining sub-rectangular ditched enclosures, and that this activity most probably represents successive phases of occupation from the later Iron Age continuing into the Roman period.337 (b) 20 copper-alloy coins, comprising two probably Antonine-period sestertii and Flavian to Antonine dupondii or asses, from a location several hundred metres north-west of Brading Roman villa.338 (2) Brighstone: 23 base-silver uninscribed staters,339 of types associated with the Durotriges, found in the same place as a previous find of 968 Iron Age silver coins discovered in 2005. 340 (3) Calbourne: two gold solidi and two clipped silver siliquae, the latter Milan issues of A.D. 395- 402. 341 WEST SUSSEX (1) Felpham, Ivy Cottage Nursery , Flansham Lane (TQ 9629 0055): evaluation identified a north- south-aligned ditch, probably of early Roman date, and further linear features and a pit which were undated.342 EAST SUSSEX (1) Alciston: 15 base metal radiates including regular and irregular issues of the Tetrici, deposited c. a.D. 274.343 336 Work by N.

At least three phases of baths have been noted. Additional excavations are planned for 20 1 2.346 SURREY (1) Abinger, Cocks Farm villa (TQ 106 474): a trench on the villa site was designed to examine the way the site is terraced and to link separate parts examined in previous excavations. It was possible to locate the foundations of the southern wall of a room that was part of the range uncovered in 1995 and show that it had a tessellated floor, as well as a parallel wall 3 m to the south. This wall was expected to be defining a corridor, but it proved to have a cross-wall joining it to the higher wall and it may be that there was originally a double row of rooms. An area in the centre of the field east of the villa was sampled where a group of anomalies had been identified in the magnetometer surveys. There was evidence for occupation but only as shallow amorphous patches of darker soil with associated pottery. Recognisable features only survived where they had been cut deep enough to have survived ploughing. One roughly V-shaped gulley contained a considerable amount of Roman pottery and two possible quern fragments. In the topsoil nearby the upper stone of an Iron Age or early Roman Lodsworth quern was found, complete but very worn on one side. Other features included a small ditch, part of the field-system located by magnetometry, and a deep pit. The whole area of the lime kiln found in the previous season347 was exposed, together with its servicing area. It was not fully excavated, to allow partial preservation and because of health and safety considerations, but enough was achieved to clarify its construction. The kiln itself was roughly circular. It was 2.8 m across and about 2 m deep from the top of the natural. To make it, a steep-sided pit had been lined with chalk lumps (down to 1 .4 m below natural), apparently intended to act as a rough wall, outside which the natural sand had been burnt red all the way around. Below the chalk lining was a layer of ironstone which had turned to powder, presumably as a result of the heat. It was probably not a natural layer but a deliberately placed part of the structure, as it was at the same depth and of the same thickness all round - except in front of the 'gate' at the front (see below), where it was absent. Near the base of the kiln several small logs lying horizontally were preserved as charcoal. Where the chalk lining was examined in more detail, it appeared that some clay had been used to hold the blocks in place. At the front of the kiln the blocks had been roughly dressed to a flat face with a clay skim in the area around and below an entrance feature which was set at the surviving top of the kiln on its down-slope side at the end of the servicing area. This area or 'stokehole' was roughly bag-shaped in plan, about 2 m wide, 2.9 m long and 0.6-0.7 m deep. Where it entered the kiln a 'gate' had been designed to close the channel. It was placed within a feature created by turning the kiln walls outwards with a cross-wall at the end to form a rough box-shape, creating a passage through the kiln wall about 0.4 m wide. The 'gate' was set on the cross-wall; it was made of two large blocks placed vertically and a lower central block governing a gap of about 180 mm. From the 'gate' the fired clay floor of the passage sloped 344 Found by Mr A. Charman while searching with metal detector(s). BM Ref.: 2011 T138 (addenda to 2008 T460).

It had been covered by an arch formed of large pre-shaped clay blocks, probably originally placed leather-hard in a corbelled arrangement and covered with a thin layer of clay as a facing. The top of the arch was not present and had presumably been removed by ploughing, and chalk blocks in the 'stokehole' fill beyond the back wall of the box-like feature were probably tumble from its back and side walls. The tumble overlay a layer of red sand and charcoal in the fill of the 'stokehole'. It seems clear that the 'gate' was a means of controlling the air flow once the fuel, which was placed at the base of the kiln, was well alight. The chalk lump charge was probably placed above the fuel, perhaps on a rough wooden structure that made use of a ledge contrived from ironstone blocks that were later reduced to powder. A Roman date for the kiln has been confirmed by radiocarbon dating of the charcoal in the base of the kiln, which gives between A.D. 70 and 134 at 68 per cent confidence and a.D. 55-216 at 95 per cent. The kiln was probably therefore associated with an early phase of villa construction at the site.348 (2) Ashtead, Ashtead Common villa and tileworks (centred at TQ 1775 6017): a trench was cut across the north-western side of the previously undated triangular earthwork a short distance to the west of the villa. Detailed survey carried out by English Heritage in 2006 had led to the conclusion that it was 'clearly a very complex and multi-period construction',349 and the excavation identified at least three main periods. The first was a wide and relatively shallow ditch, reçut in a U-shape on the same line but much narrower and deeper. This reçut was itself probably again reçut in a V-shape later on. Associated finds have still to be properly assessed, but the primary silt of the U-shaped reçut of the ditch contained very large joining pieces of shell-tempered storage vessels which should date to either side of the Roman invasion. The earliest ditch is therefore probably considerably earlier than the mid-first century a.D. The latest ditch reçut contained large fragments of Roman tile. Just inside the earthwork defences evidence for occupation included a probable hearth with associated late Iron Age pottery. The building found in 2012 about half way between villa and earthwork was further examined over a much wider area. There seem to be at least two phases of stone-founded building. The first one had wider and deeper wall foundations without offsets; a corner turning into an eastern wall gave a width between the walls of about 6 m (and therefore large post-holes noted previously are probably part of a different structure). The eastern wall was traced for about 1 1 m to the south with no sign of an end. Carefully-constructed gaps on either side of the tiled feature in the western wall were only shallow, with the foundation continuing across at a lower level. There was no doubt that the gaps were deliberate and it seems most likely that they served as the base for a structure to support and surround an impressive entrance. The second phase was an attached structure with much slighter foundations that probably had tile settings for posts; it has been traced so far for about 8.5 m, which is considerably further east than the main building, and neither its return nor its purpose are yet clear. Traces of a number of internal walls and other features, including probable hearths, were noted in both the main building and its later attachment. Associated pottery included a roughly-made lamp, a mortarium stamp of Albinus, and samian forms Drag. 29 and Drag. 15/17, all suggesting an early start for occupation in this area, in the a.D. 70s or 80s. Further work on the superimposed tile kilns concentrated on the central flue and the eastern half of the southern firing chamber, where very little of the later kiln had survived.

The later flue was built up on top of this and over the ends of the remnants of the earlier side flue walls. The remains of the side flue construction for the first kiln, which had been partially demolished, survived beneath the southern firing chamber. The outer walls of the kiln as they survived were probably those of the earlier kiln except at the western end (the back of the kiln). Both kilns were sampled for archaeomagnetic dating but have produced virtually identical dates, those from the final period being within the range a.D. 205-225 at 95 per cent confidence.350 The stokehole end of the first period flue had an added structure made of tegulae (which showed no signs of burning) placed vertically to continue the line of the flue walls and then turned at right angles to block the flue except for a gap in the centre. More flat tiles made a horizontal covering which had originally continued over the central gap. The charcoal level at the base of the flue of the upper kiln overlaid the horizontal tiles that were still present. The fill either side of this structure was the same, suggesting that the latter had been left in situ when the earlier kiln was decommissioned and that the structure may originally have been higher. It was perhaps a device to create a temporary closure of the flue once the final operating temperature had been achieved, with provision for control of the air supply. A partial parallel may be noted at the Hartfield kiln where a similar set of vertical tegulae were recorded, though on one side of the flue entrance only.351 Ashtead may provide a complete example. There are signs of a tiled base to the first period flue and a diagonal side wall which seems to face the front of the first period stokehole and probably bonds into the flue end.352 (3) Bedfont, Homers Farm (TQ 071 732): an evaluation consisting of 44 trenches established the presence of features, mostly shallow narrow ditches which form part of a widespread field-system, within the eastern, southern and western areas of the site. A few possible pits and post-holes were also identified, although these were also very shallow and no evidence was found to suggest significant activity beyond that of the field-system. Relatively little datable material was recovered; one ditch contained material of late prehistoric date, while the remaining datable features were assigned a broad Romano-British date.353 (4) Charlwood: two gold Iron Age, thirteen Roman silver coins and six bronze votive artefacts, comprising four miniature brooches, a fragment of a miniature socketed axe and a spindle-whorl.

Ditches lay mostly in the north of the site and were up to 1.4 m deep. Some produced considerable quantities of finds, including slag, daub, nails and much Roman pottery. The ditches appear to have gone out of use and in some cases may have been deliberately filled in the third century. There is evidence 350 M. Noel, Ashtead Roman Villa, Ashtead Common, Surrey.

At the north of the site flint floors, post-holes, daub, and a higher incidence of fragments of Roman roofing-tiles but no evidence for hearths suggest a group of agricultural buildings. The floors appear to be aligned east-west as are the ditches, suggesting that the ditches, enclosures and buildings are related. At the south of the site are occupation levels with considerable quantities of third-century pottery, slag and charcoal. These are edged by long, straight, clay-filled features, about 0.2 m wide and 0.3 m deep, perhaps brick-earth sills to support timber-framed structures. Several probable smithing furnaces consist of small clay-lined bowls with a gully leading to the base of each bowl. Radiocarbon dating suggests that these range from the late Iron Age to the end of the second century. One gully had three complete second-century Alice Holt jars arranged in a pyramid with a large sherd of a storage jar between. Excavation of one of a group of six magnetic anomalies in the south of the site revealed a clay-lined pit approximately 2.5 m by 1.2 m by 0.5 m deep, with a layer of charcoal across the feature and a complete decorated Alice Holt jar in the north-east corner. This may have been a bustum burial, but no bone was found. Approximately 200 coins have been recovered from plough-soil. They are unusual for the high proportion of second-century pieces with few from the third century or later. A small pit also located with a metal detector contained a copper-alloy bowl, fragments of most of three Roman glass vessels, one of third- or fourth-century cut glass, four pieces of pewter vessels, over 800 fragments of what appears to be tin alloy weighing in total about 4.2 kg, and pottery, including a samian ware patera from Rheinzabern dated between A.D. 280 and 350.355 (6) Leatherhead, Hawk's Hill : a pierced silver denarius of Hadrian was recovered from a grave in an Anglo-Saxon cemetery.356 KENT (1) Ashford: (a) Chilmington Green (TQ 976 407): evaluation of a proposed development site identified features localised in three main areas.

A Lidar survey360 has revealed many details of both the hillfort and nearby earthworks. Near the midpoint of the northern inner defences, the rear of the rampart was exposed in one pit. Observation of this area since the clearance of coppice confirms the Lidar survey in suggesting that the present track may traverse an original entrance exploiting the natural re-entrant at this point.

Another pit exposed the fill of an outer ditch while earthworks on the lower slopes of the spur here suggested a further line of defence much altered by later trackways and boundaries of medieval or later date. Pits dug along the axis of the interior revealed no complex stratigraphy. On the west of the camp the ditch fill of an external earthwork was proved, this bank on the north side extending west from the presumed western gateway for at least 200 m. (3) Canterbury ( Durovernum Cantiacorum ): (a) Castle Street (TR 1479 5765): a watching-brief361 on an L-shaped service trench recorded further elements of the theatre.362 Nine Ragstone paving blocks survived in the base of one trench, while two apparently different mortar and flint foundations were recorded in the east and west sections of the other. One of these was topped in part by three courses of Roman brick. On the basis of present knowledge of the theatre, these structures lie in the area of the south-western end of the stage close to the corner of the orchestra. A groove running over the paving may have been formed by wheeled traffic crossing a narrow route through the theatre when it was no longer in use, but while the paving was still exposed, (b) Church Lane (TR 1453 5756): evaluation363 uncovered a compact gravel surface on the line of a possible metalled road observed in 2001. 364 The earlier observation was dated to the mid-first to early second century; pottery recovered from the interface between the gravel and an overlying deposit has been dated to the second century. Overlying deposits of clay may equate to those recorded in 2001, interpreted as a building platform.365 (c) St Mildred's Tannery : the watching-brief on the main area (TR 145 577) of a major residential development was completed in 2011. Augering suggests that the ditch outside the town wall had been cut about a metre deeper, or came closer to the wall, from a few metres north of the Roman postern366 southwards to the intramural branch of the river. Augering also showed that the composition of the rampart behind the wall varies from about 2.9 m of largely gravel bands, probably all Roman, 20 m north of the postern, to about 0.9 m of clays capped by 0.3 m of gravels, with post-Roman clay heightening(s) of 0.9 m, 33 m farther north.367 (d) 25-27 St Dunstans Street (TR 1477 5822): 137 graves were recorded during excavation368 against the Roman street, 150 m outside the town's West Gate. Most burials were aligned parallel to the street in deeply-cut graves, often with evidence for coffins. The graves appeared to have been laid out in groups or rows. One part of the cemetery appeared to have been reserved for children. The cemetery was established late in the third century after the construction of the town walls (a.D. 270-290) and continued into the fourth century. Pre-cemetery activity, possibly dating from the late Iron Age and definitely pre-dating the establishment of the road, was attested by a ditch and a pit recorded in a service trench cut across the street. A further ditch recorded on the site may have initially been associated with the road, but later formed a boundary within the cemetery. Two large, 361 Work by D. Robertson, C. Sparey-Green and J.

A hollow way, possibly branching from the early road, crossed the site in a north-east direction. A series of pits and an extensive clay quarry (none of which have yet been closely dated) were also excavated. No formal burials were located despite the close proximity to the cemetery described above, (f) Old Dover Road (TR 1578 5672): excavation370 close to the site frontage revealed a length of ditch (12 m long and 0.9 m wide) running parallel to the former Roman road between Canterbury and Dover,371 metallings of which were recorded in section during later observation372 of a sewer trench. (4) East Farleigh, Oaklands, Lower Road (TQ 7280 5359): continued examination of the villa373 concentrated on area excavation of Buildings 2 and 3. Building 2 was demolished in the mid-third century to make way for Building 3. Both buildings were barns with 3.6 m wide doors on the south side. Building 3 contained a workshop at the west end and a long flue grain-drier.374 (5) Folkestone, East Wear Bay villa (TR 2410 3704): excavations continued375 at the villa site376 ahead of cliff erosion. Part of the courtyard area in front of Block A, previously unexcavated, was examined. A substantial thickness of deposits was encountered; many related to habitation that had occurred before the construction of the villa. At the base of the sequence, the surface of the natural Gault clay was sealed by a succession of clays producing prehistoric pottery and struck flint. The surface of the uppermost clay layer was cut across by a sunken, metalled trackway, associated with pottery provisionally dated to c. 100 b.c. Nearby, a substantial oven pit and a scatter of post-holes represented the earliest features of a settlement area continuously occupied throughout the late Iron Age and into the Roman period. After the trackway had gone out of use, the area became covered with soil and domestic rubbish, upon which two timber buildings with chalk floors were erected sometime in the late first century b.c. Each had been rebuilt several times but neither was very large or of substantial construction. Traces of a possible four-post structure were also recorded. After these buildings were abandoned, the area was cut across by a succession of ditches that probably delimited rectangular fields and enclosures.377 The latest ditches appeared to be early Roman and the final one in the sequence had been deliberately backfilled, probably at the end of the first century A.D., to make way for the construction of the villa. Once the ditches were levelled, the area was covered by more soil and clay before rough, patchy metalling was laid down as a courtyard in front of the Roman villa. No evidence of any associated garden or ornamental features was found. Sometime during the earlier part of the fourth century the courtyard went out of use. Part of the villa roof collapsed onto it, followed by masonry from the walls. During the mid to late fourth century, however, this debris was sealed by a new 369 Work by J.

The coin evidence suggests that activity on the site did not continue much into the fifth century.

The first phase dated to the second to third centuries a.D. and was represented by two boundary ditches, five pits and twelve post-holes. The second phase dated to the third to fourth centuries and consisted of a ditch, a gully, two pits and ten post-holes. Some of the features exhibited signs of burning and contained relatively large quantities of burnt flint, probably associated with either cooking or industry. The features were sealed by a dark, probably late Roman soil, which contained a large quantity of metal finds including coins, brooches and tweezers. The dark soil was in turn sealed by a thick colluvial layer which contained finds from the Roman period onwards.381 (8) Maidstone, former tennis courts , Church Street (TQ 7622 5586): evaluation identified three ditches indicating late Iron Age or early Roman activity on a site 140 m east of the Roman road from Rochester to the Weald. The small pottery assemblage (ranging from the first century b.c. to early third century a.D.) included early Gaulish imports and an amphora sherd of first-century b.c. date.382 (9) Minster in Thanet, land fronting Tothill Street (TR 31123 65582): excavation showed that through the later Iron Age and possibly right up to the Roman invasion, the site lay within a zone peripheral to a settlement centre to the north. The frequency and density of activity started to increase from the later first century. Initially this was represented by scattered burials, but by the second century the site had once again been reincorporated within a settlement. This was evidenced by enclosure ditches, storage pits and numerous sunken-featured buildings - a form of Roman rural architecture particular to Kent, and of which numerous examples have been found on the Isle of Thanet. Burials continued to occur and some, at least, were contemporary with the settlement. The latter appears to have been abandoned by the middle to late third century, although it may again have only migrated a short distance.383 (10) Plaxtol, Fairlawne Estate (TQ 6005 5345): a further phase of investigation was undertaken on a Roman building partly exposed and subject to limited excavation in 2009 immediately in advance of the construction of the Farningham to Hadlow natural gas pipeline. Following its unexpected discovery in 2009, the building, which from its size, layout and construction can be fairly certainly classified as a villa, was preserved in situ , with the new gas pipe drilled beneath it. In 2010 a geophysical survey was carried out on the site of the building and the immediately surrounding area. Subsequently, test-pits were dug to further investigate the building itself as well as several possibly related features identified near by. The test-pits within or adjacent to the building confirmed its extent and layout, but also demonstrated that no hypocaust was present 378 ibid. 379 P.

Finds Reported under the Portable Antiquities Scheme By SALLY WORRELL and JOHN PEARCE INTRODUCTION The Portable Antiquities Scheme was established in 1997 as an initiative to record archaeological objects found by members of the general public and was extended to the whole of England and Wales in 2003. 1 Surveys of Roman period finds recorded by the PAS have been published in Britannia annually since 2004. This ninth report gives an overview of the finds reported in 2011 and of their character and distribution. As in previous reports, descriptions then follow of significant individual artefacts recorded by Finds Liaison Officers in the year concerned, selected because of their iconography and/or their contribution to the understanding of object type or distribution, in some cases being items not previously recorded in the repertoire of small finds from the province. In this year's report the opportunity is also taken to review the evidence reported to the PAS for a specific category of artefact, namely objects for which an association with the Roman army is likely, including earlier finds as well as objects reported in 2011. OVERVIEW Almost 25,000 artefacts of Roman date were recorded on the PAS database in 201 1, a figure that, as in previous years, includes those finds to which a date has been attributed that spans the late Iron Age and early Roman period. Table 1 shows the number of Roman non-ceramic artefacts recorded on the database by county and grouped by PAS region, as well as the two numerically most significant categories of finds, coins and brooches.2 This abbreviated form of reporting replaces the former scheme, in which all non-ceramic finds were presented in functional groupings. With the exception of brooches, numbers of other individual non-coin finds in any one year are small and they are not presented in detail this year. The eight previous reports in which the data have been fully presented provide a sufficiently substantial sample to establish the general characteristics of PAS finds on a province-wide and regional basis. They allow general and regional profiles for metal-detected finds to be compiled against which individual groups of PAS and excavated finds can be compared. The 201 1 finds recorded by the PAS comprise 21,929 metallic items, primarily coins (18,222). This is the largest number of metallic finds to have been reported in a single year of operation of the PAS.3 2,948 fragments of Roman pottery were also reported, as well as small quantities of architectural material (tesserae, wall plaster and tiles) and ceramic and stone objects, including 1 S. Worrell, 'Roman Britain in 2006 II. Finds reported under the Portable Antiquities Scheme', Britannia 38 (2007), 303. As in previous years, the data for 201 1 include only a small quantity of the many artefacts recorded from Norfolk, although all records have been entered onto the Norfolk Historic Environment Record. Coins from hoards are not included in the statistics presented in Table 1. Full publication of hoards is still provided through the Coin Hoards of Roman Britain series. Details of some hoards are also available on the PAS database and the construction of a complementary database for recording hoards from Britain is planned. © The Author(s) 2012.

As in previous years, coins are the most common Roman artefact recorded: the 18,222 individual coin finds recorded in 2011 account for 83 per cent of the total of metallic finds and include 12 Greek and Roman Provincial coins.4 The Roman coins reported this year represent a further significant addition to the c. 109,000 instances recorded by the end of 20 105 and reflect the enduring impact of the initiative to record large assemblages of Roman coins in toto. The regional distribution of the coins reported this year is very similar to that of previous years, with much larger quantities being recorded in the eastern and south-eastern counties of England than in northern and western England and Wales. In almost all counties substantially larger numbers of coins were reported in 2011, especially in Avon, Cambridgeshire, Kent, Suffolk, Surrey, Kent and Wiltshire, in some cases significantly extending the samples for these counties. The 1,966 brooches recorded for 2011 account for 9 per cent of all finds recorded in this year, a typical annual percentage. The sample reported for 2011 represents an increase of c. 15 per cent in the total number of brooches documented by the Scheme, 12,968 having been recorded between 2003 and 20 10.6 The distribution of brooches is also very similar to that already documented, being concentrated in eastern counties from North Yorkshire to Essex, with notable numbers also from Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire, and in some central southern and south-western counties. Although the absolute numbers of finds concerned are not large, the figures for 2011 illustrate a pattern, which can also be seen intermittently in previous reports, of a significantly higher than average ratio of brooches to coins found in the west and north-west Midlands, especially Shropshire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire, Cheshire and Staffordshire. As has been observed for previous years the distribution of finds reported shows significant and complex regional variation which is the product of multiple factors, including the character of Roman period societies and economies, modern agricultural regimes and metal-detecting practice. 4 A selection of the most important coins is published annually in the British Numismatic Journal by S.

I).10 A hollow copper-alloy handle bearing animal and divine faces, near-complete, with some damage to the socket and crushing on one face. It is 61.8 mm long, 31.6 mm wide, 18.8 mm thick and weighs 83.6 g. On either side of the handle is a face and at its end is a boar's head. Depending on the angle of view some elements of decoration can be read as belonging to either one of the faces or the boar's head. The youthful, clean shaven face can be identified as Mercury by the wings emerging from the hair (which also serve as the boar's ears); the god's features are schematically rendered by incision. The eyes are lentoid, the right containing a central dot to represent the pupil and the left a dot positioned at the top of the eye. Beneath the broad nose and slit mouth, the elongated face ends in a narrow chin. The hair descends in curls on either side of the face. The older face, also elongated, is that of a satyr or Pan, with moustache, long beard and deeply furrowed brow. The horns and goat ears also serve to mark the boar's lower jaw-line. The boar's head is well-shaped with careful modelling and incision is used to represent detail on the face and the underside of the jaw. On either side of the ridged mane, the flaps of the sub-triangular ears lie against the head. Both small lentoid eyes contain a central punched dot to represent the pupil. The snout has an encircling groove and the mouth is slightly open with triangular tusks emerging from the lower jaw. A circular aperture (4 mm in diameter) perforates the snout, and is worn above and below, suggesting its use for suspension. The socket of the handle, which is near oval with a raised collar, has sustained some damage. Lead survives within the socket, presumably as the remnants for a fixing. The surface is worn but is well preserved with a dark green patina. XRF analysis demonstrated that the metal is a heavily-leaded bronze consistent with Romano-British alloys. A close parallel, better preserved, from Niederbieber, with a much more fully naturalistic rendering of the figures, suggests that this was a key handle. 1 1 7 Throughout the year staff in the British Museum, in particular Ralph Jackson and Richard Hobbs, together with Martin Henig (University of Oxford) have provided invaluable support in the identification of individual objects.

The representation of Mercury may perhaps relate to the safeguarding of the proceeds of trade. The janiform imagery, seen not only in the paired faces but also in their combination of youth and age, may be appropriate to door-keeping. An association with the boar is more difficult to interpret, though key handles in the form of zoomorphic figures are not uncommon. Parallels for objects bearing faces on opposite sides can be found in Roman iconography (e.g. on some intaglios from Britain12) and also in La Tène art.13 12 M.

The toggle is 84.5 mm long, 15 mm high, 13.8 mm wide, and weighs 61 g. The mid-section is pierced by a rectangular slot 24.7 mm long and 8.0 mm high. The decorative recess on its upper face is divided into three panels. In the centre is a square panel with two raised ridges running diagonally across the middle forming a sinuous cross and defining four cells, in two of which blue enamel survives. Each end panel is subdivided into three sections, the central ones of which contain blue enamel, while the others are now empty, but perhaps originally held red enamel. The toggle, either side of the decorative panel, is waisted and then flares to circular-sectioned terminals which rise to dome-shaped knops bearing fluted decoration. At the centre of each dome are circular recesses, which may originally have held enamel insets. The toggle is of early Roman date - though of recognised native or late Iron Age form and inspiration - and was found near a hoard of copper-alloy bowls and strainers of similar date.15 The use of polychrome enamel and the fluting on the terminal bosses are Roman elements suggesting a date of manufacture certainly between a.D. 50 and 150 and probably between a.d. 60 and 120. Around 30 examples of toggles are currently known. This is only the fourth known from Wales, with other examples coming from Maescar, near Sennybridge,16 Brecon, Powys (NMGW-2362B2), and near St Brides Major, Vale of Glamorgan (NMWPA 2009.101).

The leopard, with its head high and its tail curled forward and resting on its back, stands on a near-rectangular base. Some of the mouldings representing its spots are still clearly visible on the animal's flanks. The eyes, snout and ears are finely moulded and on the head on which the paw rests some moulding to show the hair can still be seen. At one end of the object, against the leopard's hindquarters, is a shaft and loop. The inner surface of the loop is slightly worn and may have held one end of a chain or rope.

An elaborate key handle depicting a panther with its paw on a ram's head was found at Silchester.19 The existence of similar iconography on funerary monuments means that the motif on mundane objects such as this may have been susceptible to reading as a memento mori.20 FIG. 3.

The object has a diameter of 41 mm, is 3.2 mm thick, and weighs 19.4 g. The upper surface of the circular stud has three narrow concentric circles of reserved metal separating bands of enamel decoration. The outer band is of blue enamel with rosettes in two rows, their white petals surrounding a white centre contained within a red circle. The inner band has a background of white enamel surrounding fourteen rosettes, their blue petals also surrounding a white centre contained within a red circle. The centre of the stud has a red background with squares in two patterns alternating in a chequer-board arrangement - one a blue square as background for a rosette in the same form as in the outer band of decoration, and the other itself a chequer board of miniature blue and white squares. Similar discs with millefiori decoration, though differing in the detail of their decoration, are known from Chepstow, Mon., and Usk, Mon.22 PAS has recorded four studs inlaid with millefiori enamel in a similar style from Hibaldstow, N Lines. (NLM-3F9905), Wigginton, Oxon. (BERK-555701), Thornham, Norfolk (NMS-40A082), and Freckenham, Suffolk (SF-D 17023). 19 G.C. Boon, The Roman Town of Calleva (1974), 205, fig. 32, no. 6; S.

It is 59 mm long, 31.7 mm wide, 10.7 mm thick, and weighs 64.3 g. The man lies on a couch and is straddled by a woman who faces his feet, which she holds, while the man's left hand rests on her left buttock. A small section of the handle, behind his head, has broken away and there is a circular hole for the knife's tang. The modelling is relatively crude and the features of both individuals are much worn. The handle is corroded with a rough, dark brown patina. The closest parallel noted so far is a handle of unknown provenance with somewhat better modelled features, which was sold by auction at Christie's in December 1998.24 The reverse mulier equitans scene is also paralleled on other objects, for example the discus of picture lamps.25 Other knife handles portray erotic scenes, but all those otherwise known from Britain involve variations on the theme of three individuals 26 Three other examples, all in a similarly provincial style, have been recorded by the PAS from Over Wallop, Hants. (HAMP-4D3135), Monk Soham, Suffolk (SF-A23522), and a fixed-blade knife handle from Syston, Lines. (LIN-536F87).27 23 Found bv S. Sunter. Recorded bv A.

At the centre of the fitting is a domed boss decorated with punched dots around the rim. An incised circle around the crown has radiating grooves that flare towards the base of the boss and which were possibly decorated with niello. There are traces of a white metal coating on the rest of the fitting. At the back of the dome is a rectangular lóop. A flat decorative element in the form of a closed pelta crescent projects from either side of the dome. The bulbous ends of the crescent on the right join to form a closed loop, but the peltoid on the left side is broken. A curved hook projects from the top edge of the dome and terminates in the form of a stylised bird, probably a swan with a pronounced rounded forehead and a flat beak which flares outwards. The hook is twisted slightly to the right. At the bottom of the dome is a broken edge from which there would have been another projection, perhaps in the form of a loop. The break is patinated. The object is 29.6 mm long, 26.6 mm wide, 21.3 mm thick, and weighs 11.8 g. No close parallel has been found, though it bears some general similarities to military harness strap fittings.29 28 Found by M. Andrusyk. Recorded by A. Downes and S. Worrell. e.g. E.

Dowries) NORTH LINCOLNSHIRE (7) Crowle (FAKL-9900E3) (fig. 7).30 Three joining fragments of a small cast copper-alloy pan decorated with champlevé enamel. The handle and base are missing. The surviving fragments are 107 mm long, 41 mm high and 2.2 mm thick. Most of the enamel is now missing, but the champlevé cells show the decorative scheme consisted of a series of roundels (37 mm in diameter) set around the vessel, each enclosing a three-armed whirligig with the arms containing enamel-filled recesses. It appears that the whirligigs were inlaid with mid-blue and light green enamel and each was surrounded by a ring inlaid with red. The roundels appear to have been set touching each other in pairs. Between each pair were three horizontal bars of enamel inlay, comprising two green bars separated by a band of red. Above and below the horizontal lines were pairs of lung-like motifs inlaid with red, surrounded by green, enamel and containing what appear to be pairs of opposed comma motifs. The distortion of the fragments makes it impossible to determine the original dimensions of the vessel, but it is clear that it was originally convex with a diameter comparable to that of other bowls in the series. The similar Ilam pan has a circumference of 281 mm, suggesting that around 38 per cent of the original circumference of the Crowle bowl survives. The vessel's rim bears an external beading 3.8 mm wide by 2.9 mm thick. Below this is a plain band, 4.2 mm wide, separating the rim from the decorated zone. All of the fractures appear to be old, suggesting that the damage is not recent, and the surfaces are corroded with some loss of patina. This pan is the third of its type recorded by the PAS: previous finds are the Ilam ('Staffordshire Moorlands') pan (WMID-3FE965) and the vessel found at Winterton, N Lines. (NLM-F50443).31 30 Found by D. Wilson. Recorded by K. Leahy. S. Worrell, 'Enamelled vessels and related objects reported to the Portable Antiquities Scheme 1997-2010', in D.J.

However, the decoration on the Ilam pan is more fluid than that on the Crowle bowl and all the roundels touch. It is known that enamel-decorated vessels were being made at Castleford (W Yorks.) and while most of the material produced there bore geometric or leaf designs, some 'Celtic' designs were applied; one vessel fragment from Castleford, while adorned with leaf-motifs, bears some stylistic similarity to the Crowle find.32 FIG. 7.

Leahy) LINCOLNSHIRE (8) Osbournby (LIN-1213A7) (fig. 8).33 A copper-alloy hollow object in the form of a human head with caricatured and grotesque features, crudely modelled. The back of the head is plain. The object is 34 mm long, 16 mm wide, 20 mm thick, and weighs 17.4 g. At the top is a small loop for suspension, indicating its likely purpose as a steelyard weight (though its weight is low and traces of lead alloy within the head have not been seen). The grotesque adult male head, elongated and asymmetrical, shows remarkable facial detail. On the left eyebrow is a large projection representing a boil or excrescence. On the forehead above is one or possibly two similar, though smaller protuberances, from which a ridge runs to the nose, further emphasising the creased and lined character of the face. The figure has projecting ears of different sizes, with deeply recessed interiors; these are placed asymmetrically, the left ear being further forward than the right. The socket of the left eye is much more pronounced than the right, which contains some traces of glass. Across the bridge of the prominent and very broad nose is a thick band of flesh, accentuated on the left side of the face by furrows which extend across the cheek; the upper and longer of these may represent a scar. On the right cheek is another large boil. While the tip of the nose points to the right, the tongue lolls to the left as it emerges from the large, thick-lipped mouth. At each corner of the mouth is a hole, though the perforation does not extend across the mouth. 32 H.E.M. Cool and C. Philo, Roman Castleford Excavations 1974-1985.

Daubney) (9) Market Rasen (LIN-B8FA27) (fig. 9).39 A second-century a.D. copper-alloy bust bearing a close resemblance to portraits of Antinous. The bust, 84 mm long, 62 mm wide and 35 mm thick, is hollow and the surviving remains of an iron shank suggest that it is a furniture fitting, perhaps from a chest. The bare-chested figure faces forward, his gaze slightly upturned. The very full head of hair is swept forward from the crown, from which radiate thick locks running in a neat fringe across the forehead and falling to the neck on both sides, with an exceptionally thick clump over both ears. Individual strands are delineated by incisions. The face, flat and square jawed, lacks expression, as noted on other similar representations, and there is little fine detail. The thick neck and broad shoulders convey a muscular physique. The recessed eyes and nipples lack the inlay they would originally have held. If correctly identified as Antinous, this is the third such depiction of Hadrian's favourite from Britain; a high quality bust was 34 Worrell, op. cit. (note 1), 317-18, no. 12, fig. 13.

IO).42 A Roman copper-alloy statue fragment, 91 mm long and 40 mm at its widest. The object is in fair condition with a green patina. The fragment represents the left hand of a third- to half-life-size statue. It is broken just above the wrist and much of the back of the hand is also missing, having broken away more or less along the line of the knuckles. The forefinger is extended while the others curl towards the palm and the tips of the middle finger and thumb touch. Had the hand originally grasped an object, such as a spear or sceptre, it is unlikely that the forefinger would be so extended, but too little is preserved to identify the specific gesture. This represents a further addition to the group of fragments of monumental Roman statues documented by the PAS.43 Other examples are more commonly from life-size images. In this case, greater contextual information than for other finds allows its original setting to be suggested. Among the associated artefacts reported from an extensive scatter of Roman period material of first- to fourth-century A.D. date is the largest assemblage of horse and rider brooches (95) yet to be documented from a single site in Britain (revising the figure of 19 40 B.

The hexagonal hoop has neatly incised decorative edges and triangular shoulders with elaborate openwork. The small hexagonal box bezel, with sloping sides and flat surface, is set with a tiny oval gem, its surface now largely degraded, but what does remain is black in colour and there is evidence of an engraved design. The ring has an external width of 16.2 mm, an internal width of 13.9 by 11.1 mm (the dimensions of the bezel are 8.1 by 7.3 by 2.9 mm), and it weighs 2.46 g. Non-destructive surface metal analysis conducted at the British Museum indicated a gold content of 90-93 per cent and silver content of 5-7 per cent. Raman spectroscopy indicated that the degraded gem is more likely stone than glass. FIG. 11. Rolleston area, gold finger-ring (No. 11). Scale 1:1. ( Photo : C. Burrill ; © Derby City Council) 44 S.

The left forearm extends outward from the elbow and the poorly formed upturned hand holds a patera. The right forearm is missing, and the well patinated break suggests that the damage occurred in antiquity. The elongated face, completely framed by the toga, is somewhat stylised; the large lentoid eyes are set within deeply recessed sockets, the brow ridge extends downwards into a slightly bulbous nose, the mouth is narrow and the chin is squared. The folds of the toga's drapery are more fully modelled on the front of the figure, especially the deep fold which runs diagonally across the body to the left shoulder. The toga hangs almost to the ankles of the figure. The undersides of the heavily corroded feet display an off-white corrosion product, possibly representing a degraded solder. In profile the figure is unusually thin, emphasising, as might be expected, that it was intended to be viewed from the front. The figurine measures 65.1 mm high, up to 30.6 mm wide, 18.1 mm deep, and weighs 47.9 g. Its current appearance follows conservation which has revealed significant additional detail. Parallels for copper-alloy figurines of this type have been found in Britain, including examples from a stratified context within the forum at Silchester 48 and from the excavation of a late third- to early fifth-century Romano-Celtic temple at Lamyatt Beacon, Somerset.49 A plausible context for its original display is in a lararium.

The object has been hollow-cast and the inside filled with lead. The face is sloping and has realistically moulded features; the eyes are defined by pointed oval grooves with recessed pupils, the brow extends downwards to the nose, the mouth is small and the lips are closed. As well as its bushy beard the face is also framed by a raised band of curls. The locks of both hair and beard are represented as large clumps. The weight is cracked down one side and this damage extends to the top where an iron prong from the otherwise missing loop is visible. The opposing end of the prong is visible on the flat underside of the weight, which is open and reveals the corroded lead infill. At 73.1 g, this weight may represent three unciae , a quarter of a Roman pound. It measures 29.8 mm high, 28.7 mm wide and 35.3 mm deep. This is a further example of a steelyard weight in figurai form from Britain.51 FIG. 13. Pirton, steelyard weight in the form of a male head (No. 13). Scale 1:1. {Photo: J. Waiters; © J.

The object is 50.9 mm high, its- greatest surviving width is 11.8 mm, and it weighs 56 g. The horse has cast detail on its mane, while the eyes have been punched. Only the right side of the neck carries decoration in the form of a group of small punch marks. The surviving part of the wings extends from the back of the neck. The ends of the forelegs, which are not separated on the figure, are missing. The object is broken at two points; at its lower extremity and above the extension on its back. Another horse protome recorded by the PAS is that from Brandon and Bretford, Warwicks. (WMID-774A77), but this, like most similar continental examples, lacks wings. A closer winged parallel of similar size, but more finely modelled, comes from Boudevilliers, Malvilliers (Neuchâtel) in Switzerland. The function of the Crowmarsh object is uncertain, but it may have been a fitting on a piece of furniture, a lamp or a vessel.53 50 Recorded by J. Waiters.

The well moulded horns curl around small downturned ears that project from the side of the head; the tips of the horns also point slightly outwards. Although the ram's facial features are worn, the slightly recessed eyes on either side of its head can be discerned. Some modelling of the nostrils is also visible, especially on the right side of the head. The worn traces of what may be curls from the fleece can be seen between and behind the horns. At the back of the head is a slightly raised band forming a collar around an internal recess, within which is set the shank of an iron tang with traces of the lead alloy solder that held it in place. At the end of the shank, 39 mm long, the upper section of the bit is preserved. Zoomorphic key handles are widely known from excavated and PAS examples. The only other key handle featuring a ram was reported to the PAS from Winthorpe, Notts., but here it is held between the jaws of a lion.55 Ram's head terminals are, however, documented on other artefact types, such as handled pans. Zoomorphic decoration on key handles often comprises the forequarters of large felines, especially lions, and dogs, but rarely herbivores, as in this case.56 54 Found by R. Smith. Recorded by A.

The group comprises the following vessels: a small complete conical bowl with pellet-bead rim (Lee Type l62); an incomplete pedestal bowl with square flange of a previously unknown form; an incomplete large octagonal dish (Lee Type 2)63 with chicken bones found directly beneath it; an incomplete hemispherical pedestal bowl with thick rim (Lee Type 2e);64 an incomplete hemispherical pedestal bowl with beaded rim (Lee Type 2i);65 an incomplete flanged dish of under 300 mm diameter (Peal Type 4).66 The composition of the group is not dissimilar from that of other assemblages of pewter vessels, but such groups are typically recorded from structured deposits in wells and pits and not, so far, from a destruction deposit, as appears to be the case here, where the findspot relates more closely to the context of use.67 FIG. 17.

The fitting is rectangular in plan with sloping sides and a slightly rounded top. The interior is hollow and an arching bar of circular section runs lengthwise within it. The long sides of the object are decorated with palmettes, and on the top are opposed isolated fronds. The fitting is 39 mm long, 19.5 mm wide, 29.23 mm thick, and weighs 37.45 g.

It is a striking object, both in terms of its large size (the original statuette would have stood at least 300 mm high) and its workmanship. It is impossible to identify the subject, but the slender leg conveys the impression of an athletic young male and the bareness of the foot may suggest divinity. The lower leg of a slightly smaller figurine reported in 2011 from Whittington, Northumberland (NCL-BD0923), is similarly well rendered, though it still bears flashmarks which had been filed. The sophistication of the rendering of both examples makes them unusual within the province.71 FIG. 19. Acle, lower leg of figurine (No. 19). Scale 1:1. {Photo: A. Marsden; © A.

It is rounded at the terminal with a small aperture left open at either end. A separate transverse loop formed from triple-ribbed strip is soldered into position at the top, with separately applied solid globular testicles to either side. Separately applied wire - with irregular transverse grooves on the underside, perhaps to act as keying for the solder - defines the edge of the foreskin. The length (including loop) is 21.5 mm, the width is 3.5-4.5 mm and 10 mm at testicles, and it weighs 2.44 g. The pendant is similar to solid gold examples from Braintree, Essex (ESS-0CDDC1; Treasure case PEE 81), and Knaresborough, N Yorks. (SWYOR-E56143). In Britain the use of apotropaic amulets of this form, in a variety of materials, has sometimes been associated with the presence of the Roman army but examples, including this one, also occur in rural contexts.73 71 Durham, op. cit.

There are two raised and gilded circular eyes located just in front of the gilded, elongated triangular dorsal fin which extends halfway along the dolphin's back. The fin is decorated with incised vertical lines along its length. There are two short, pectoral fins with a central groove, set just back from the eyes and terminating before the end of the dorsal fin. The tail curves up and over the body of the dolphin and terminates in a triangular fin. The mouth and upper surface of the tail are damaged. The underside of the dolphin is plain and undecorated. There are doublé, D-shaped lugs, with central perforation for the missing hinged pin, projecting from the underside of the tail; one is damaged and incomplete. The catchplate, which is now distorted, projects from behind the mouth. The brooch is 30.4 mm long, 11.1 mm wide across the side fins, 9 mm wide across the tail, 8.9 mm thick, 19.7 mm deep, and it weighs 10.2 g. The brooch is similar to examples published by Hattatt (suggesting a date of the first to second centuries A.D.) and to a fine example from Suffolk of a dolphin inlaid with curved niello panels, with a winged Cupid sitting astride it.77 FIG. 22.

The figure has crudely modelled and worn facial features and is heavily draped. A veil extends from the figure's headdress down the back of the neck. The figure's right arm is held against the side of her body and the right hand holds a dish. The left arm is slightly bent, and the hand is hidden beneath the folds of the robe which hangs to the base of the figure. The left leg is bent slightly and the right leg is straight. This and the impression of the body's form revealed by the folds of cloth over the abdomen and thighs give the figure a greater realism. The figure stands on a plain, hollow base and the feet are not visible.79 The attributes of the figure do not allow for certain identification, but stylistically it has a number of parallels with central Rhineland depictions of Juno of early second-century A.D. date.80 There is a somewhat similar but incomplete figure from Hofstade in Gent, Belgium, perhaps produced in the Moselle region.81 Beyond the Capitoline triad, the cult of Juno was 77 R.

The lower edge of the sheet is broken off and now lost, and there is also associated oblique crease-damage on one border. Immediately adjacent to the broad broken edge and pushed through from the back are three tiny perforations.

It is 20.9 mm high, 31.8 mm long, 16.2 mm thick, and weighs 13 g. The leopard's large head is turned to the right and its features are crudely modelled. Its small ears point upwards, the mouth is a small horizontal groove, and both eyes are circular recesses; the right eye contains what may be traces of decayed enamel. Each of the three short legs represented in a sidelong view of the leopard terminates in a sharp point. The tail is curled around the body and extends horizontally towards the head. Decoration on the body consists of ten unevenly distributed circular cells which are filled or partially filled with decayed enamel. On the back of the brooch are two D-shaped lugs, the corroded remains of a copper-alloy pin, and an incomplete, short catch-plate. The brooch lacks a patina and the surface colour is reddish brown. Two other leopard brooches, both of which represent females, have been recorded by the PAS, one from Little Waltham, Essex (CAM-925392), and the other from Bradfield Combust with Stanningfield, Suffolk (SF9384).

The nose is triangular and somewhat flattened, perhaps as a result of damage to the mould. The mouth is narrow, but both lips are visible, the chin is rounded and the head is supported by a broad neck. On the chest is a small, flat oval disc with a crescent beneath it, perhaps a bulla and another amulet, but the means of suspension for neither is indicated. The back is flat with a slightly uneven surface and a rectangular-sectioned integral rivet projects from it at neck level. The features, executed in a fairly naturalistic manner, are reminiscent of portraiture of the first century A.D.

Individual finds with a military connection have been among the most noteworthy reported to the PAS, in particular the Crosby Garrett helmet and the Ilam ('Staffordshire Moorlands') pan, as well as fragments of a diploma found near Scarborough.97 Among the more commonly occurring artefacts to be reported, some items stand out because of their good preservation - for instance a third-century openwork belt-plate decorated with enamel and millefiori glass from Kingsclere (Hants.)98 - and others for their typological or iconographie interest - for example a phalera from Yscir, Powys," an unusual late fourth-century openwork buckle from Chepstow showing a stylised helmeted rider,100 a looped strap slide from Cambridge bearing a three-dimensional representation of a horse's head,101 and an early Roman stud from Nottinghamshire with repoussé decoration in the form of a male head in profile, reminiscent of examples from Caerleon.102 Finds of military objects - namely weapons, vehicle fittings, belt and harness fittings and mounts and other horse gear - quantified as categories I and J in previous annual summaries, comprise in toto a small percentage of the artefacts reported in any one year (typically c. 1 per cent of metal objects). Nonetheless by accumulation over the last 15 years a substantial body of more than 2,000 objects which may be associated with the Roman army has been documented. Military metalwork has received renewed scrutiny in recent years for its potential not only as a possible proxy form of evidence for the distribution of Roman army units or for insights into soldiers' equipment, but also in relation to the social identities of soldiers and their relationships with the communities amongst which they were stationed.103 The following provides a summary of this category of artefacts from the first to fourth centuries A.D. recorded by the PAS - the types of object found, their quantities, date and distribution - and briefly considers aspects of their significance and interest.104 Particular 97 Crosby Garrett: Worrell and Pearce, op. cit.

This overview is the first stage in a wider study by the authors of this now very substantial body of data.</page><page sequence="114">384 SALLY WORRELL AND JOHN PEARCE emphasis is placed on the frequent occurrence of 'military' objects of mid- and late imperial date in a rural setting in the province, especially in midland and eastern Britain. Table 2 summarises the distribution of metal objects recorded by county, organised into PAS regions. It is based on a review of the descriptions and images of all instances of object types relevant to this category recorded on the database up to the end of 2011. In order to define relevant objects, this survey has used the major studies of Roman military equipment from Britain and adjacent areas. For presenting the data in summary form, the studies by Chapman and Nicolay, respectively of military finds from Roman Wales and non-military sites in the Rhine delta, have been especially useful as a guide, in particular the latter because of its extensive use of objects found during metal-detecting.105 Catalogues of major relevant finds assemblages from excavations have also been consulted.106 In general, artefacts identified as the equipment of Roman soldiers are interpreted as such either by function, representation in images of soldiers and their mounts, epigraphic evidence (especially ownership inscriptions), occasional textual references, and in particular their occurrence on military sites. As scholars working in this area have noted, it is often not easy to attribute individual object types - especially some belt or harness fittings - to a specifically military context, especially in the mid- and later imperial period, because they have also been shown to occur on non-military sites. This is most emphatically demonstrated in Nicolay's recent survey.107 For the purposes of tabulating and mapping finds, the definition has therefore been drawn broadly and not all scholars would accept some of the artefact types presented here as having an association with the Roman army. Nicolay, for example, includes the looped strap mount, a type of harness fitting otherwise not usually considered in this connection.108 The categories chosen for Table 2 present the data in approximate chronological order. The offensive and defensive weapons include swords, spears, daggers, chapes, armour and helmets. The vehicle fittings specifically comprise artefacts of first-century A.D. date in the form of an eagle's head above a hexagonal socket with a projecting hook depicting a water bird's head, to which reins may have been secured.109 The other categories are: buckles, plates and strap ends from belts and baldrics of the first to third centuries A.D.; phalerae, i.e. as elements of horse harness; miscellaneous harness elements, principally junction loops, strap unions, strap fasteners; mounts,110 primarily decorative fittings for leather strapping in a variety of forms - including square, rectangular, circular with or without a central boss, conical, vulvate, openwork, peltiform, Trompetenmuster , swastika forms - with a separate listing for both looped strap mounts (i.e. with one or two rectangular fixing bars111) and phallic mounts; button-and-loop fasteners; pendants, comprising elements from the military apron and horse 105 e.g. M.

Allowing for variations in definition, the quantity is equivalent, for example, to those used in major surveys of Roman military equipment, such as the c. 1,300 objects examined in Chapman's corpus of evidence from military sites in Roman Wales, the 1,665 instances documented by Oldenstein in his fundamental study of second- and third-century A.D. metalwork associated with the Roman army in southern Germany, or the c. 2,700 objects from over 300 non-military sites in the lower Rhine region assessed by Nicolay, of which 44 per cent were collected by metal-detectorists outside a formal fieldwork setting.113 When individual object categories are scrutinized the significance of the new PAS data is also apparent. In 2008 an additional 177 examples of button-and-loop fasteners were available to compare with those discussed in previous surveys.114 Since that time the number reported to the PAS has increased by a further 160 examples. Equally the 21 bird mount vehicle fittings represent a significant number of new finds of objects of this type,115 as do the 164 crossbow brooches116 or the many more strap ends of fourth-century belts recorded by the PAS which are much more widely distributed than previously known examples.117 As in the case of excavated military metalwork, it is also essential to take taphonomic factors into account in assessing the character and distribution of metal-detected material.1 18 The nature of the material and the circumstances of discovery determine some significant differences from excavated assemblages of similar artefacts.119 The number of weapons, offensive or defensive, is very small and such items, with occasional exceptions such as the Crosby Garrett helmet, occur in only very fragmentary form. This must in part at least reflect the absence of iron (as well as bone) objects (for obvious reasons) from metal-detected finds, and also the lack of examination of context types that might produce complete or near-complete examples of such objects, for instance graves and votive deposits in pits or rivers. The only example of riverine deposition of arms recorded by the PAS is at Piercebridge; the finds of scabbard elements (slides, runners and a chape) and of fragments of armour (especially scale armour) account for many of the mounts and strap ends as well as the unusually high number of weapons in County Durham.120 Some individual finds may also derive from votive deposits or graves, perhaps for example the Ilam pan or the Crosby Garrett helmet, but without excavation this remains supposition. The difficulty of identifying, and perhaps consequent non-reporting, by detectorists of fragmentary remnants of shields, helmets and armour (including, for example, tie loops) is also likely to have influenced the low representation of this category.121 The predominance of horse harness and, to a lesser extent, belt elements is not unexpected; fittings certainly or probably related to horse harness - especially mounts and pendants - were also 1 12 Late Roman spurs have been recently reviewed elsewhere: H.E.M.

The high representation of belt buckles and strap ends of the late Roman period among the objects reported to the Scheme is a phenomenon already known from other studies123 and may well reflect the greater recognisability to detectorists and perhaps also to Finds Liaison Officers of these highly decorated objects, often bearing zoomorphic iconography. Table 2 also shows that the highest numbers of objects are found in the counties of eastern England from Yorkshire to Essex, with frequent finds also in the central and north-east Midlands, i.e. a zone between the Humber, Severn and Thames estuaries. The quantity of objects recorded from Norfolk is striking, since the overall number of objects from this county entered on the PAS database is otherwise much lower than for other counties in East Anglia.124 With the exception of an arc from the Solent to the Severn few are reported in the coastal counties of southern England or from upland northern and western England and Wales. This is very similar to the distribution of all Roman period objects reported to the PAS, as comparison with the summaries of object distribution annually reported in Britannia and with the numbers and density of coins by county demonstrates, which must reflect similar biasing factors of regional variability in ancient societies, modern agriculture and detecting practice.125 An additional influence on the distribution of military objects as recorded by the PAS is of course the scheduled ancient monument status of many garrison sites in northern England and Wales. The distribution of individual object types is, with some exceptions, similar to that of the general category. For example the distributions of buckles of different dates recorded by the PAS (figs 30 and 31) have only minor differences in emphasis, with a greater concentration of findspots of first- to third-century A.D. buckles in Lincolnshire and slightly fewer examples in Norfolk and Suffolk than might otherwise be expected.126 There are very few first-century A.D. buckles or strap ends in this group, especially examples of pre-Flavian date: first- and second-century hinged buckles and second- to third-century buckles with trapeziform extensions comprise the majority of instances. The distribution of late Roman zoomorphic buckles (fig. 31) shows a slightly greater emphasis in the West Country and East Yorkshire, though the clustering around the Severn Estuary apparent in other recent studies - drawing on metal-detected material not reported to the PAS as well as excavations - is not manifested here.127 The distribution of pendants of first- to fourth-century A.D. date is also generally similar to that of all the object categories (fig. 32). A regional emphasis is not visible in the distribution of single pendant types, except perhaps for openwork, leaf-shaped and sub-triangular examples which cluster to some degree in Norfolk. The object with the clearest regional profile in its distribution is the button-and-loop fastener, the majority of findspots being in the east Midlands and north-east England, especially North and East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. This has previously been noted, but can now be documented on the basis of a very much larger sample.128 122 Nicolay, op. cit.

Distribution of pendants of Roman date recorded by the PAS.</page><page sequence="122">392 SALLY WORRELL AND JOHN PEARCE Although the objects discussed here represent a substantial new dataset, it will of course be important in future study to take account of the caveats expressed above. There are significant biases in the PAS dataset, both in the types and in the distribution of finds documented: in particular the upland areas where permanent garrisons were sited have only very limited representation among PAS records. While the overall numbers of objects are quite large, there are very few substantial assemblages from the same site, the main exceptions being the River Tees at Piercebridge, as already mentioned, or the numerous fittings found outside the fort at Brecon Gaer, Yscir, Powys, which also represents an otherwise unusual collection of objects from a recognised military site, on which work is currently in progress.129 From an initial evaluation, however, it is otherwise only occasionally possible to identify groups of objects from the same or related sites, for example at Brancaster in Norfolk: otherwise even in regions where they are abundant, objects of the types considered here occur in only very small numbers or in isolation amongst other categories of finds, though there is scope for closer examination of local distribution patterns.130 Nonetheless some points of wider interest can be made. This survey points to the abundance of military objects in rural areas of the province, which after the conquest phase of the mid-first century A.D. lacked garrisons stationed in close proximity to them. Some forts may remain to be discovered here, but while the sites from which these objects originate are difficult to define on the basis of unstratified evidence alone, most are likely to be farms or, more occasionally, villas or small towns, and perhaps occasionally shrines or disturbed burials. Some finds will also be part of the widespread 'background noise' of Roman finds produced by ancient and post-antique agricultural practice and geomorphological processes.131 Some of the arguments advanced to explain the presence of military items in towns may apply here, including chance loss by passing troops, the stationing of soldiers either in units or as benéficiarii , the manufacture of objects of this type, and veteran settlement.132 In some cases their presence may be a product of a scenario outlined by Nicolay, i.e. the return of discharged auxiliaries to the places from which they had been recruited or with which they had become associated during military service, having retained items of equipment to be disposed of in rite of passage rituals on leaving the army or curated as heirlooms.133 But as Nicolay also observes, it seems unlikely that such a wide distribution of objects of this type in a broad array of forms can only be the product of military activity. His argument that 'the terms military and civilian cannot be satisfactorily applied' in the case of several object types - especially in the belt and harness fittings used for men and animals, particularly horses - after the first century A.D., seems to be strongly reinforced by these data.134 Unlike Nicolay's case study area, immediately adjacent to the frontier, this province-wide survey shows a distribution of artefacts of this category - especially dress and above all harness items - extending hundreds of miles from the frontier. Objects of this type may prove in future to be more abundant on garrison sites than on any others when excavated data are taken into account; nonetheless the evidence considered here suggests the existence of a general koine of decorative and apotropaic metalwork for dressing and adorning people and horses that extends across military and civilian communities.

It should also be noted that the distribution in the PAS dataset of the many belt buckles and strap ends of the later fourth century a.D. - so extensively discussed for their possible insights into the distribution of late Roman soldiers - extends across a zone in which the practice of adorning the bodies of men and horses with metal ornament had already been well established in former centuries. In this respect their presence arguably represents the changing expression of an established practice. On this basis, it could be argued that the general distribution of items of harness and suspension gear should be established as a reference point against which that of specific artefact types may be compared in order to assess their importance.

Wright in The Roman Inscriptions of Britain Vol. i (Oxford, 1965) and (slightly modified) by R.S.O. Tomlin, R.P. Wright and M.W.C. Hassall in The Roman Inscriptions of Britain Vol. iii (Oxford, 2009), which are henceforth cited respectively as RIB I (1-2400) and III (3001-3550). Citation is by item and not page number. Inscriptions on PERSONAL BELONGINGS and the like (instrumentum domesticum) have been arranged alphabetically by site under their counties. For each site they have been ordered as in RIB, pp. xiii-xiv. The items of instrumentum domesticum published in the eight fascicules of RIB II (Gloucester and Stroud, 1990-95), edited by S.S. Frere and R.S.O. Tomlin, are cited by fascicule, by the number of their category ( RIB 2401-2505), and by their sub-number within it (e.g. RIB II.2, 2415. 53). When measurements are quoted, the width precedes the height. 2 During excavation (site code LBN08) by MoLAS, and now in Mortimer Wheeler House, where David Bowsher made it available. Information also from Jenny Hall. Letter heights: 1, 23 mm; 2-3, 19 mm; 4, 17 mm. Judging by the space below, 4 was the last line. Since lines 2 and 3 are both indented by one letter, and 4 by two more letters, the inscription was evidently centred. The leaf-spray would have been balanced by another to the right, sacrum can be restored in line 1 (compare RIB 1041, Silvano invicto sac(rum)) and ex voto in 4 (compare RIB 584 and 1305), but these alone would not allow space in 2 and 3 for the cognomen of each dedicator (see below). So it is likely that Silvan [o] was followed by a title, for example invicto or pantheo (compare RIB 1041, just quoted, and 1271, Silvano [pa]ntheo' or was linked with numen Augusti in some form (compare RIB III, 3054, Silva [no] et / num [i] n [i] [A]ug(usti) n(ostri )); and that the verb was supplied in line 4, for example posuerunt.

Dover Roman fort ( Dubris , TR 31 41) (fig. 2). Capital and upper portion of the die of an altar made of fine-grained limestone, 0.29 by 0.26 m, 0.22 m deep, found4 in 1976 in a late Roman context inside the south-west corner of the Saxon Shore fort, but probably deriving from the classis Britannica fort abandoned in c. a.D. 208.

Dover, altar (No. 2). {Drawing: Kent Archaeological Rescue Group) The dedicators in lines 2 and 3 bear the same praenomen and nomen; they might therefore be father and son, but they are much more likely to be freedmen of a Publius Fabius [. . .], with P(ublii) l(ibertus) forming the middle part of their nomenclature; they would have been distinguished by their cognomina, now also lost. This base supported a votive statue of Silvanus, a woodland god explicitly associated with hunting in RIB 1041, 1207 and 1905. His name was not necessarily preceded by deo: compare RIB 1041, 1271, and III, 3054, quoted above. After the stone figure of a hunter-god was discovered beneath Southwark Cathedral, Ralph Merrifield suggested that it came from a cult shrine near the road-junction south of London Bridge ('The London hunter-god and his significance in the history of Londinium', in J. Bird, M. Hassall and H. Sheldon (eds), Interpreting Roman London : Papers in Memory of Hugh Chapman (1996), 105-13, especially 108), noting two related figures from London. He discussed the cult in southern Britain, suggesting that the deity was Apollo Cunomaglos, to whom an altar (RIB III, 3053) is dedicated at Nettleton Shrub. However, this site also produced an altar to Silvanus (RIB III, 3054, quoted above), which suggests that Silvanus was an alternative identification (ibid., 110). During excavation by the Kent Archaeological Rescue Unit, and now published by Brian Philp in The Discovery and Excavation of the Roman Saxon Shore Fort at Dover, Kent (2012), 111 with fig. 55, where he comments: 'As it survives, it appears to be dedicated to the Mother Goddesses (DEAE) of the province of Britannia (BRIT ANI).' The limestone is like that of RIB III, 3031 (Dover), an altar dedicated to the Matres Italicae by a st(rator) co[n(sularis)] to mark his building of a shrine (aedes). (Reference communicated bv Martin Henig.) 5 This is the first instance from Britain of this dedication, but compare RIB 643, Britanniae sanctae; 2 1 75, genio terrae Britannicae ; 2195, Campestribus et Britanni(ae). The mis-spelling of Britannia is trivial and well-attested, but is previously unknown from Britain itself, since the Carlisle writing-tablet (RIB II.4, 2443.5) 'addressed' to someone IN BRITANIA must have originated from elsewhere. In Dover, a port of entry, this mis-spelling might suggest that the dedicator had just arrived from another province, but unfortunately his name and status have been lost.</page><page sequence="126">III.

Ian Caruana made them available with his comments. Unlike the next two items, which consist of strongly bedded stone and are thus probably slabs, this item shows no bedding and is part of a block; it was an altar, to judge by the line-width (see next note). 7 In line 1, only the horizontal bottom stroke survives of the first letter, E or L; it is too wide to be the initial serif of M, a letter which is suggested by the converging diagonal strokes that follow, but to be rejected because there is no initial vertical stroke, and the second stroke of 'V' does not align with the vertical stroke which follows. PR therefore begins a new word, presumably praefectus (abbreviated). In line 3 there is trace of a triangular stop after PRAEF, followed by sufficient remains of the first diagonal of A. In line 4, only the curving top survives of the last letter (since followed by uninscribed space); thus it is C, G or S . Just enough survives of lines 3 and 4 to identify the dedicator as prefect of ala I Tung (ro rum), a cavalry regiment attested at Papcastle by six lead sealings {Britannia 36 (2005), 487-9, nos 22-27) after it left the Antonine Wall {RIB 2140). There was an ala Moesica (but no cohors ), but this cannot have been the previous or subsequent command of a praefectus alae , so MOESIC in line 2 must refer to the classis Flavia Moesica (however abbreviated), with PR in line 1 as the beginning of praef(ectus). Command of this fleet on the lower Danube was a sexagenary post senior to the command of an ala; for an example of this progression, see ILS 8851 with Devijver PME A21. The dedicator, before naming his present post, evidently cited his new appointment. LVI in line 1 probably concluded his formal nomenclature, his place of origin perhaps, for example ¡foro Fu] lvi {ILS 2261). On this reconstruction, the line-width can be calculated quite closely; leftward by the loss of I TVN in line 4, and rightward by the vertical coincidence of PR[AEF], MOESIC[AE] and A[LAE] in lines 1-3. There would have been 3-4 letters before PRAEF in line 3, corresponding to classis Flaviae above it in line 2, much abbreviated; perhaps an abbreviated dynastic title after Moesic[ae], for example Gordianae as in ILS 885 1.</page><page sequence="127">398 R.S.O.

A possible restoration is [IV1L or [VAIL PVDfENSl, the name flull(ius) or rVall(erius) Pudfensl. 9 The generously spaced M suggests a tombstone headed by D vacat M, but this is only a possibility.

Information from David Petts and David Mason, who sent a photograph. The fragment is at present in the Department of Archaeology, Durham University. 1 1 Line 1 : the spacing suggests T before V, but first letter F or P would also be possible. In the edge there is apparently the beginning of a third letter, resembling the tail of S. Line 2: the letter after SAC is E reversed, i.e. ligatured; the slight rake of the vertical, and the apparent nick of a serif in the broken edge, suggest ER. Lines 3 and 4: enough survives to guarantee the formulation here of '[name of ala] cui praeest [name of commander] praefectus equitum' Although cui praeest unabbreviated to C P is found in the third century (RIB 1914, 1983), it is more likely to be second-century, but in either case the cavalry unit would be the ala (Hispanorum) Vettonum c(ivium) R(omanorum) which is attested at Binchester by RIB 1028, 1032 and 1035 (all undated), and probably by 730 (from Bowes, the adjacent fort) in A.D. 197/8. This is presumably a building inscription, which would have been headed by the name and titles of the emperor. It concluded with the names of the unit responsible and its commander, which would have been preceded by a reference to the governor. However, the sequence SACER cannot be accommodated to any known governor, and it is conceivable that a consular date was inserted, Tertulio et Sacerdote co(n)s(ulibus) (a.D. 158), the year in which RIB 1389 (see below, Addendum (d)) suggests that the Hadrianic frontier was being reconstructed.</page><page sequence="129">400 R.S.O.

(References communicated by Sheppard Frere.) 19 This praenomen is often used as a cognomen, but a derived name is also possible; for example Sextilius, Sextinus , etc. 20 In the late fourth-century demolition layer, during excavation by Maidstone Area Archaeological Group. Information from A.J. Daniels and Dana Goodburn-Brown, who made it available. A is sometimes 'open', sometimes written with a cross-bar. S is reversed. R occurs twice in (i) and four times in (ii), visually in a vertical sequence, and alternating from left to right; the tail probably indicates the direction of writing. The left margin of (ii) is irregular, as if it marked the ends of lines, not their beginning. ONERAT[VS] in particular seems to have been written from right to left. The crowding of letters towards the end of MEMORIAN[VS] and CONSTITV[S] suggests they were written from left to right, and space ran short. The space after CONSTANO . .) is apparently not inscribed, and A is written over T. 22 See previous note. It is not uncommon for 'curse tablets' to be written by reversing the letter-sequence in various ways, including the use of mirror-image letters, and the other tablet from Kent ( Britannia 17 (1986), 428, no. 2) is written 'boustrophedon' with alternate lines inverted, but there is no British parallel for the present format, which seems to be unsystematic. Since it is too elaborate to be due to error or incompetence (and note that CONSTAN(. . .) was corrected), it must have been intentional, whether to make the text more difficult to read and thus 'secret', or to 'confuse' the lives of the persons named (for which see C.A. Faraone and A. Kropp, 'Inversion, adversión and perversion as strategies in Latin curse-tablets', in R.L. Gordon and F. Marco Simón (eds), Magical Practice in the Latin West (2010), 381-98). 23 (i) ATINED[ is probably a transcription error for Celtic Atidenus ( CIL xiii 8627). Sacratus (with a diagonal T) is well attested in Gaul, and although Latin (but not in Kajanto), is one of a group of cognomina which 'conceal' a particular Celtic name-element (e.g. RIB II.7, 2501.481, Sacra). Celtic Sacirus is also found in Gaul. Celtic Atrectus is well attested (e.g. Tab. Vindol. II, 182.14), but there are some Latin cognomina in -ectus. (ii) Cundacfus J, unless the second C is actually G, is for *Cundagus (better *Cunodagus ), which is not actually attested, but is composed of two Celtic name-elements. Cunoaritus is an elaboration of Cunoarus (attested as a British mortarium-maker; S.S. Frere, Britannia (1991), 204, n. 23). The other four names are Latin cognomina. Onerai [us] is rare, but see RIB III, 3108 (with note). Memorian[us] is also rare, but one of those derived from Memor (Kajanto, 255).

Engraved retrograde, above a scene perhaps of human figures and animals, one surviving letter: [. . .]A28 25 During excavation by MoLAS, for which see Britannia 40 (2009), 260. Amy Thorp made it available. There is space after the third letter, followed by a sinuous curve which does not look like a letter-form; then four more letters. This is apparently a neuter plural, i.e. a commodity, not a personal name. So perhaps AIE£OA(I)KA was intended, the double zigzag of £ being reduced to a double curve, and iota omitted by oversight. This would be the neuter plural of an adjective derived from ôié^oôoc, used as a medical term for 'evacuation' [of the stomach] by Hippocrates {Prog. 11 (Alexanderson, 206.5), quoted also by Galen). The derived ôieÇoSim would then mean '(agents) causing evacuation', i.e. 'purgatives': this sense is not attested, but purging played a large part in ancient medical practice, and various effective agents were available. The suggestion that this was a Roman apothecary's jar must remain uncertain, in view of the difficulties of reading and interpretation. But many Roman doctors, even in Britain, were Greek-speaking, which would explain why a good-quality vessel of British manufacture should have been quite carefully inscribed in Greek. The best parallel seems to be the small amphora from the Athenian agora which bore the graffito Ôio')p(r|TiKÓv), 'diuretic' (M. Lang, The Athenian Agora : Results of Excavations Conducted by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Vol. XXI, Graffiti and Dipinti (1976), 75, Hd 21), but in the West compare CIL iv 5738 (Pompeii), ajar with the painted inscription lomentum flos ' ex lacte asinino Uticense ('best-quality lotion from asses' milk of Utica'); also RIB II.6, 2494.94 (Carpow), an amphora with the graffito 7cpóci[ov] ('horehounď, a cough remedy); and the Haltern medicine-box lid inscribed ex radice Británico ('British Root', Dock used as an antiscorbutic) ( Britannia 22 (1991), 143-6). 27 During excavation (site code FEU08) by MoLAS for Land Securities, directed by Robin Wroe-Brown and Gemma Stevenson. It is now at Mortimer Wheeler House, where Angela Wardle made it available and provided information. It belongs to the group of shallow convex bowls with Biblical, Christian, classical cult or hunting scenes, which includes the Wint Hill bowl (RIB II.2, 2419.45; J. Price and S. Cottam, Romano-British Glass Vessels: A Handbook (1998), 125, fig. 51a). The differentiation in width between the two uprights of A shows that it was meant to be read through the glass, i.e. that it was inscribed on the underside of the bowl. It was therefore the last letter of the word which identified the scene, whether feminine singular or neuter plural.</page><page sequence="134">III. INSCRIPTIONS 405 FIG. 12.

At Tinwald just to the south (NY 003 813) in 2010, the same detectorist found a lead disc 23 mm in diameter, with central hole and moulded 'milling', which weighs 53.74 gm. This is almost two unciae (54.58 gm), but there is no inscription. The weight is just over one libra (327.45 gm) of twelve unciae. VIII ('8') cannot refer to the number of unciae (12), but is perhaps an error for XII. It is hardly a note of the number of scripula (each of 1 . 137 gm) by which it was overweight, since such precision would be unparalleled. 51 With the next fourteen items, and the two stone altars noted last year (Britannia 42 (201 1), 441, no. 5 and 443, no. 6), during excavation for East Lothian Council by AOC Archaeology directed by John Gooder.

One modius was equivalent to 8.754 litres, and contained 16 sextarii. The first two letters are incomplete, but their remains are almost identical, consisting of a diagonal foot curving at the end; this suggests a rather angular C. Since there is just enough space to the left to see them as the beginning of the graffito, it seems that the initial letter was written twice. The third letter has also lost its top, but can be read as a rather narrow A. This reading CCA is confirmed by the sequence which follows: Candidus is a common cognomen. Only the bottom survives of the final letter, which is either A or I. Although Candidi (genitive) is the most likely reading, Candida (feminine) and even Candidifanus] are possible.

Inveresk, samian graffito (No. 36). {Drawn by R.S.O. Tomlin) 57 D is only a small triangle, scratched perhaps under cursive influence, but more likely to be sub-literate. The omission of L may be an error due to confusing L with V, both letters being made with the first stroke angled into the second. Final S is incomplete. To the left of this graffito is part of another, now illegible, which was probably the name of another owner. The name Decibalus , also written Deceba lus, is the most frequent Dacian personal name, famously that of the last king of Dacia. Dan Dana, whose Onomasticon Thracicum (in preparation) will supersede D. Detschew, Die thrakischen Sprachreste (1957), has collected 25 instances; in Britain they are RIB 1920 (Birdoswald), RIB II.7, 2501.156 and probably II. 8, 2503.242 ( Densibalus ). Dan Dana (see previous note) comments that Drigissa is also a Dacian personal name, there being three instances already cited by Detschew. Although Decibalus is attested at Birdoswald (RIB 1920), where cohors I Aelia Dacorum was stationed, Dacians did not necessarily serve in ethnic Dacian units: a military diploma of a.D. 127 (RMD IV, 240) was issued to a Dacian who served in cohors II Lingonum in Britain, and four of A.D. 178 (RMD III, 184; IV, 293 and</page><page sequence="146">III.

The graffito is complete, except for the tips of some letters, and there is no reason to doubt the reading. F is made in cursive fashion with a hooked second stroke, set too high for it to be read as K. A is also of cursive form. But the name Fradegus or Fradegius is unattested and of unknown etymology; there seem to be no Dacian/Thracian, Celtic or Germanic analogues. 60 The medial point makes it clear that the owner had two names (in the genitive case here), if not also an abbreviated praenomen now lost. There are other nomina ending in ulius, but the imperial nomen Iulius is so common that its restoration is probable. Only the (incomplete) first stroke of A survives, but its angle in relation to L and especially to the the foot-ring excludes the reading of I. The most likely cognomina are Laetus and Lat inns, but there are many other possibilities. Since the owner was a Roman citizen, he is more likely to have been a legionary soldier than an auxiliary, especially since a legionary centurion is attested at Inveresk (Britannia 42 (201 1), 441-4, nos 5 and 6). Ka[t]i could also be restored, but the name Karus is more common. Both are quite often written with initial K for C: see RIB II.7, 2501.281, 282 and 283.</page><page sequence="147">418 R.S.O.

The broken edge runs diagonally, so the letter A, for example, might have been written quite close to P. P is made with an incomplete loop, and only the first apex of M survives before the break, but the name Primus (and its derivatives such as Primitivas) are so common that the reading is sufficiently certain. There is no knowing whether it was written in the nominative or genitive case. This might be the initials of a Roman citizen's tria nomina, but is much more likely (especially in view of the reduced V) to be an abbreviated name. The most likely is the praenomen Publius , often used as a cognomen, but also possible is a name derived from it, for example Publianus , Publilius and Publicius.

The text of this altar, already damaged in 1683 when Martin Lister gave it to the University of Oxford, has since weathered away almost entirely except for the first two lines. Our knowledge of it derives from two independent seventeenth-century transcripts, the first being that by Brian Fairfax the elder (1633-171 1).70 The second is by Lister himself in a letter of c. 1677 which he published in 1683. 71 The latter is reproduced by RIB , but only in its published form; Lister's manuscript (fig. 37) shows that it misrepresents the original in three places: line 5, EM of salutem is ligatured; line 9, AM of aram is ligatured; line 9 ends in DE ligatured. All three points are confirmed by Fairfax.72 Lister transcribes the contentious line 9 as ARAM SAC F NC DE, but two further corrections are possible, (i) Fairfax transcribed 'F' as a lower-case 'f (or short 's' with medial cross-bar), in contrast to the upper-case F he used for PRAEF immediately above; this unusual letter, with its marked leftward tail, was probably a mis-reading of E reversed 65 Compare the previous item (PI 1). The third and fourth letters are reasonably certain, the two apices of M followed by the loop of P. Simplex is quite a common name: in Britain, it occurs at York ( RIB 690), Maryport (860), Carrawburgh (1546) and Kirkby Thore ( RIB IL7, 2501.518).

VIII. 3, which is cited by RCHM Eburacum , but not by RIB. Drake says it was 'taken from the original', but does not date it; however, it was surely earlier than Lister's transcript, since the altar was found in 1638 at Fairfax House, York, the seat of Thomas Fairfax (1560- 1640), the father of Brian, from which it was transferred much later to the house of the first Duke of Buckingham (1648- 1721), who married Thomas' granddaughter; according to C. Wellbeloved, Eburacum, or York under the Romans (1842), 87-8, it was here that Lister saw it. 71 In his Letters and divers other mixt Discourses in Natural Philosophy (1683), 115-16 with figure, which is not cited by RIB or RCHM Eburacum ; instead, they cite the letter's first appearance in Phil.

Nick Hodgson publishes a drawing by Robert Cay contemporary with the discovery in 1751 of this (now lost) building-stone dated A.D. 158, which confirms Cay's reading of the initials in the ansation as S and F.76 Hodgson also shows from unpublished contemporary documents that it was found in Wall-mile 8 or 9, probably in Wall-mile 73 RCHM Eburacum interprets the letter as a mis-read leaf-stop, but this is visually less likely. It is required by their reading of ac (see next note), but that too is unlikely. RCHM Eburacum conjectures AC for 'NC', but this does not account for the third diagonal of Lister's 'N' 75 This expansion is conjectural since, although an altar is sacra in RIB 725, an ara augusta is unparalleled in Britain, and apparently elsewhere; it does occur in ILS 3090 (Rome), but the allusion is to Augustus. RIB notes (after Birley) that a P(ublius) Aelius Marcianus is attested as praef(ectus) coh(ortis) I Augustae Bracarum in ILS 2738, so that line 9 may conceal the abbreviated title of this unit; the question is discussed by Jarrett in Britannia 25 (1994), 56-7, who notes that military diplomas attest a cohors III Bracaraugustanorum in Britain. The numeral is different, but it may be added that prefects (or tribunes) of a cohort almost always specify their cohort; the few exceptions, in Britain at least, always come from the fort where the cohort was stationed, and even then it is usually named elsewhere in the text. But Fairfax and Lister seem to have been careful and independent observers, and it is difficult to suppose they both made the same error. Perhaps Marcianus, by dedicating this altar at York to celebrate his continued good health, implies that his posting had now ended and that he was on his way home; thus he might have recorded his rank, but not his post, since this was now occupied by another. 76 N.

His tentative suggestion (63, n. 9) that SF, which Wright thought were the initials of the centurion reponsible, might instead be an abbreviation for signifer is not supported by ILS 2198 (Rome), since a new fragment has shown that it reads BF, b(ene)f(iciario) (M.P.

It can be seen that the tile-maker finished his graffito with two horizontal lines; the slighter line which subsequently cut them is casual. Lynne Lancaster (see above, No. 27) sent a photograph. op. cit. (note 4), 112, citing ILS 2735 (Camerinum), which names him as M. Maenius C.f. Cor(nelia) Agrippa L. Tusidius Campester. For his nomenclature and career, see A.R. Birley, The Roman Government of Britain (2005), 307-9. Unfortunately the Dover fragment is only known from a rubbing, so it is not possible to check whether there was trace of E before the reduced S in the second line; but if there was, it would exclude the restoration of st[rator consularis] (abbreviated) preferred by RIB, and explain why S was reduced: presumably to fit Campester into a limited space. This is an attractive idea, but open to the objection that the prefect would have used only the names M.
