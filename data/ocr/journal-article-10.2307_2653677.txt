<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philosophy and Phenomenological Research Vol. LIX, No. 2, June 1999 A Cause for Concern: Reasons, Causes and Explanations DANIEL HUTTO University of Hertordshire, Waiford Campus This paper argues against causalism about reasons in three stages. First, the paper investigates Professor Davidson's sophisticated version of the claim that we must understand reason-explanations as a kind of causal explanation to highlight the fact that this move does no explanatory work in telling us how we determine for which reasons we act. Second, the paper considers Davidson's true motivation for regarding reasons- explanations as causal which connects with his claim that reasons are causes. He advo- cates anomalous monism in order to solve the mysterious connection problem. In assess- ing his proposed solution to this problem, the paper examines his 'extension reply' to the charge that his token identity theory ultimately results in epiphenomenalism. The paper argues that only a reading of this reply makes for a stable anomalous monism but for this reason Davidson's compatiblist metaphysics is unfit for the task of solving the mysterious connection problem. Given that reductive accounts are incompatible with the special features of reasons explanations, the paper concludes that we must reverse the ortho- doxy once again and eschew causalism about reasons and reason-explanations. Finally, the paper considers a possible way of recasting our understanding of causation so that the mysterious connection problem disappears. "During the heyday of neo-Wittgensteinian and Rylean phi- losophy of mind the era of little red books, it was said that propositional attitude explanations are not causal explanations and that beliefs, intendings, imaginings and the like are not even candidates to be causes.... We have come a long way since then. The work of Davidson, Armstrong, Putnam and Fodor (amongst others) has reversed what was once ortho- doxy and it is now widely agreed that propositional attitude attributions describe states and episodes which enter into causal relations" -Lepore and Loewer, 1989, p. 175 1. Introduction If propositional attitude psychology must be understood by normative inter- pretationalist lights then it cannot be reduced or naturalised. Nonetheless, some interpretationalists hope to make peace with naturalism by subscribing to a form of non-reductive physicalism. This is standardly motivated by a A CAUSE FOR CONCERN: REASONS, CAUSES AND EXPLANATION 381</page><page sequence="2">desire to endorse a causalist view of reasons and their mode of explanation. Thus for both reductionists and non-reductionists, as Lepore and Loewer sug- gest in the opening quotation, causalism is not only dominant in today's ana- lytic philosophy of mind, it has the status of a new orthodoxy. This is unfor- tunate because minimally it obscures what is most important in the study of reason-explanations and maximally, in its most common Humean forms, it is unintelligible in this domain. The concern of this paper is to establish the former and to motivate the project of finding a replacement understanding of 'mental causation'.' My strategy is as follows: I critically investigate David- son's sophisticated non-reductive version of the thesis. This analysis is useful because it reminds the reader that treating reason-explanations as a kind of causal explanation does no explanatory work in answering the key method- ological question: How do we determine for which reasons we act? It is because Davidson explicitly recognises this that his account is both deci- sively distinct from, and prima facie superior to, reductive versions of causal- ism. But if claiming that reasons-explanations are a species of causal explana- tion was never meant to solve the 'primary reason problem' then we must ask: What really motivates Davidson to make this claim? Essentially, it was the felt need to explain the mysterious connection between reasons and actions that motivated him to think that reasons are causes. And given his non-reductionism, he developed the metaphysics of anomalous monism in order to make this claim intelligible. However, some have claimed that anomalous monism is unworkable because it ultimately results in epiphe- nomenalism. Davidson has a potential reply to this critique which I have elsewhere labelled 'the extension reply' (cf. Hutto, 1998a, p. 50). Unfortunately if anomalous monism is to be a stable doctrine the 'extension reply' must be read weakly (cf. Hutto 1998a pp. 51-58). But the price of this way of achieving stability is that Davidson's compatiblist meta- physics is unfit for the task of solving the mysterious connection problem. In a nutshell, endorsement of the weak reading leaves us unable to justify the principle of the nomological character of causality. And unless independent support for this principle can be found there is no argument for anomalous monism. More damning, without support for such a principle there is no sound basis to suppose that causal relations can, in principle, always be fully explained by appeal to the laws of an ideal physics. It appears that only a more straightforward reductionist metaphysics could provide such a basis. But I believe, like Davidson, that reductive accounts are incapable of dealing with the special, normative character of reasons explanations (cf. Hutto, 1999). On these grounds I argue that we ought to reverse the orthodoxy once again and I make the case against other forms of causalism in chapter two of my book, The Presence of Mind (1999). 382 DANIEL HUTTO</page><page sequence="3">eschew causalism about reasons and reason-explanations. I conclude by suggesting a possible way of recasting our understanding of causation in this domain so that the mysterious connection problem disappears. 2. The 'Primary Reason' Problem To some philosophers it is self-evident that our everyday discourse com- mits us to the claim that psychological phenomena cause, and are caused by physical events (e.g. events in our bodies and environment). That is to say, in ordinary language we commonly speak of reasons, beliefs, feelings, anxi- eties, pains, and a host of other psychological phenomena as if they were appropriate items to mention in the explanation of the production of 'rough grained' bodily actions. Likewise, we often explain the occurrence of particu- lar thoughts, feelings and pains by appeal to the apparent fact that they have been caused by non-psychological events, both inside and outside our bodies.2 This kind of talk is the ground for the view that, in general, a large range of psychological phenomena and in particular reasons are both causally efficacious and warrant causal forms of explanation. Nonetheless there was a period in recent history when this allegedly commonplace insight was far from universally accepted in philosophical cir- cles. For example, consistent with his rejection of the 'Intellectualist Legend' Ryle cautioned that, "...we should not swallow the traditional stories about the occult antecedents of either deliberate or impulsive actions" (Ryle, 1949, p. 115). Likewise Melden's target, in his book Free Action, was the, "...apparently innocuous suggestion that free action is to be distinguished from action that is not free, not by the absence of causal conditions, but by the presence of certain specific sorts of mental causes" (Melden, 1961, p. ix). As the opening quotation suggests, Davidson has been a central figure in reversing the non-causalist orthodoxy concerning reasons and their mode of explanation. The main thrust of his seminal article, "Action, Reasons and Causes", was to convince us: that (i) a merely teleological analysis was inadequate to deal with the mysterious connection problem, and that (ii) it was at least possible that reasons could be causes. Furthermore, despite his sympathy for some aspects of the teleological approach, he endeavoured to supply sturdy support for the conviction that (iii) reason-explanations must be understood as a species of causal explanation. But Davidson's position is sophisticated and, because it highlights features that put him at odds with other more reductive causalist accounts, it must be handled with care. 2 Indeed, Child claims that the main reason for thinking that, "action explanation is a form of causal explanation [is] simply the conviction that an action explanation is an explana- tion of something's happening" (Child, 1994, p. 109). A CAUSE FOR CONCERN: REASONS, CAUSES AND EXPLANATION 383</page><page sequence="4">Consider his claim that citing a reason (which he calls a primary reason)3 is not the same as citing the reason for an action. Usually a person has more than one primary reason for acting at any given time, yet in many circum- stances only one reason is the reason for the action. There are a wealth of alternative belief/desire pairs which could make sense of any given action but citing one or another as the cause is allegedly necessary if we are to explain why a person acted (Davidson, 1987b, p. 42). Consider this scenario: I have promised my wife that I will wash the dishes before five o'clock and being a man of my word I intend to do so. According to Davidson this would be a primary reason, a rationale, for my doing the washing up before the appointed time. However, it may be the case that, despite my intention to keep this promise the reason I do the washing up before five o'clock is because, unexpectedly, I get a phone call from a friend who has decided to come round for tea at four. Since the tea cups are at the bottom of the pile, and I don't want my friend to see the kitchen in a state, I choose to do the washing up before he arrives. The latter reason (my desire to get some clean cups and to keep a tidy house for my visitor) 'pre-empts' the former reason (my desire to be true to my word) in the production, and hence explanation, of this action. In other words, citing the latter reason tells us why in this instance, I actually did the washing up. In light of such cases, Davidson argues that we must read the because in such common remarks as "I did the washing up because I wanted to impress my visitor" as indicating a causal relation.4 What separates a reason for acting from the reason for acting is that when we give the reason we are attempting to designate the mental event(s) which, as far as we can tell, actually 'produced', 'brought about', 'was responsible for' or 'caused' the action in question.5 This is how the 'champion of the causal analysis' intends to show that, "when we offer the fact of the desire and belief in explanation, we imply not only that the agent had the desire and belief, but that they were efficacious in producing the action" (Davidson, 1980a, p. 232). He concludes that when we give the reason for acting we must cite the cause of the behaviour. Using Melden as a foil Davidson sets out to show that to accept the non- causalist position is to be, "without an analysis of the 'because' in 'He did it According to Davidson, when we give rationalizations of a person's behaviour we must do so in terms of beliefs and desires-the conjunction of which he calls the primary reason for acting. "A primary reason consists of a belief and an attitude, but it is gener- ally otiose to mention both" (Davidson, 1980a, p. 6). He writes, "If we interpret this 'because' as implying (among other things) a causal rela- tion-and I believe we must-then in describing an action as performed with a certain intention, we have described an action with a certain causal history" (Davidson, 1980a, p. 254). This is why, "the causal character of the concepts used in talking about action is an essential part of what must be grasped in coming to view the nature of action explana- tion" (Davidson, 1987b, p. 38). 384 DANIEL HUTTO</page><page sequence="5">because...' where we go on to name a reason" (Davidson, 1980a, p. 11). He uses the example of a man who signals when approaching a turn to illustrate the problem. If we look at these events as causally unconnected then, although we can make sense of the arm-raising in terms of social context (it being the appropriate kind of action to take by sensible road users), we have yet to explain why the man took this action in this instance. All that could be said in this case is that, "He had a reason to raise his arm, but this has not been shown to be the reason why he did it." (Davidson, 1980a, p. 11). Thus, the most serious objection to Melden's neo-Wittgensteinian account of reason explanations is that it overlooks the need to connect the reason to the action. It is mainly on this ground that Davidson, contrary to the Wittgensteinian tradition of the time, insisted in his early essays that reason-explanations were a species of causal explanation and that, "[a] reason is a rational cause" (Davidson, 1980a, p. 233). He claimed that: Much of the explanatory force of reason-explanations comes from the fact that they specify which pair, from among the vast number of belief-desire pairs that were suited to cause the action, actually did cause it (Davidson, 1987b, p. 42). But this claim can mislead. It may appear to say that by giving attention to the causal character of reasoned explanations we will be able to designate "which belief/desire pair caused the action" thereby furnishing much explana- tory force. But careful consideration of Davidson's wider account reveals that this cannot be right. For example, consider how we actually designate the reason for acting. We standardly ask the person and accept their answer. And, unless we have good reason to think otherwise, we tend to treat others as authorities in these matters. It is with this in mind that Johnston writes: The individual is treated not as a site of causal processes but as an agent, and quta agent he is attributed a privileged role, for by citing a consideration he authoritatively locates his action in the wider network of aims and intentions which gave it its sense (Johnston, 1989, p. 45). Accepting this does not commit one to the view that our reasons are always obvious or transparent to ourselves or others. In developing a careful explication of my action, I need to review my reasons. Perhaps there are many and perhaps, in the end, no single or simple explanation will do (i.e. most reason-explanations contrast with the relatively transparent situation of the 'washing up' scenario). For instance, if asked why I am typing this page right now I might answer: I may be typing it simply to finish this paper before start of next semester, or out of a sense of duty, or in the hope of get- ting my thoughts clear. Perhaps I am typing it for all of these reasons at once. I may favour one, or all, of these explanations and it would still be possible that someone may offer an interpretation that will convince me that I am, in fact, mistaken or (worse) self-deceived. If so, they will furnish a A CAUSE FOR CONCERN: REASONS, CAUSES AND EXPLANATION 385</page><page sequence="6">more plausible or powerful account of the pattern of my behaviour. Further- more, as Johnston makes explicit, Davidson accepts this. To return to the example Davidson considers, if we wished to find out why the man raised his arm the appropriate way to do so would be to ask him. His statement would demonstrate that not only did he have a reason to raise his arm but that was his reason for so doing. Here David- son would accept that the agent has a privileged role in stating his reasons for action... (Johnston, 1989, p. 45, emphasis mine). But we might wonder, what gives the agent the authority of saying which one out of a host of possible reasons actually causes the action? How does the agent come by this knowledge? Some would suggest that the agent has epistemically transparent access to this special class of internal causal events (i.e. reasons). To make this plausible it would be necessary to clarify the nature of this special relation between persons and their internal events in such a way that explains the nature of this privileged access.6 Apart from the crude metaphysics inspired by such a picture, its most serious problem is that it gives too much authority to the agent.7 Self-interpreters can be badly mis- taken about the reasons for their actions. If we see the general pattern of their behaviour failing to fit with their own accounts in most cases this does not result in a collapse of understanding, but a challenge to the agent's honesty (cf. Davidson, 1980a, p. 18). So, while recognising a certain degree of first- person authority we must also recognise that there is still some epistemic gap between us and our reasons. In that case, we might ask: Does a third-personal causalist account prop- erly characterise how we come to know about our reasons for acting? If reason-explanations are treated as straightforward causal explanations, as pro- posed by reductionist accounts, then saying why we act would be no different from making hypothetical judgements about causes of any other kind. But this cannot be the right story either. A wholly third personal response is not a live option because it would give too little authority to the agent. Thus, the question remains: How do we determine which reason, or reasons, best explains an action? When making our reply we ought to be mindful of Wittgenstein's query: This is consistent with Davidson's admission that, "It comes closer to characterising first person authority to note that the self-attributer does not normally base his claims on evi- dence or observation..." (Davidson, 1984b, p. 103). However, he is also aware that, "it is long out of fashion to explain self-knowledge on the basis of introspection" (Davidson, 1984b, p. 103). He has done much to obviate the need to suppose the existence of special relations between agents and posited internal events by using features of radical interpre- tation in order to explain the source of first-person authority in the case of propositional- attitude ascriptions. I discuss the problems with this kind of metaphysics more fully in (Hutto, 1995b, pp. 465- 66). 386 DANIEL HUTTO</page><page sequence="7">What is the difference between cause and motive? - How is the motive discovered, and how the cause? (Wittgenstein, 1953, p. 224). Davidson is mindful of this question. On his account the reason for acting must be designated, to borrow Hornsby's idiom, from within the 'personal point of view'.8 We must somehow decide that one belief/desire pair has explanatory priority over others and then designate it as the cause-not the other way around. But if this is the correct explanatory order then treating the 'because' as indicating a causal relation doesn't perform the job of helping us adjudicate between competing hypotheses in the way 'looking for the cause' of say a plane crash would. In the latter case we begin by attempting to reconstruct the events surrounding the crash (as they relate to the particular case). We subsequently employ our general knowledge of what tends to hap- pen in like cases so as to isolate the cause. But, I say again, this is not the method used when we give reasons for our actions. No appeal to inductive regularity is involved. In itself this is not damning to causalism. For as Davidson notes, we do not always have to appeal to induction in order to know that a causal relation exists or to accept that there are causal laws at work. He writes: ... induction is a good way to learn the truth of a law. It does not follow that it is the only way to learn the truth of a law. In any case, in order to know that a singular causal statement is true, it is not necessary to know the truth of a law; it is necessary only to know that some law covering the events at hand exists. And it is far from evident that induction, and induction alone, yields knowledge that a causal law satisfying a certain condition exists. Or to put it differently, one case is often enough, as Hume admitted, to persuade us that a law exists, and this amounts to saying that we are persuaded without direct inductive evidence that a causal relation exists (Davidson, 1980a, p. 18). But the point to note is that, unlike other causal investigations, in the case of reasons we begin and end by making a true singular causal statement after having decided why it is that we acted. On this basis, we simply assume that there is a law available under some other description which explains the causal relation. The point is that appeal to causality here does nothing to eliminate or discredit any of the alternative rationalizations of our action. This is further highlighted when we consider that reason-explanations will never be reduced to causal explanations due to their normative character.9 As Lennon notes, "a purely regularist approach would not be applicable here" (Lennon, 1992, p. 236). Davidson writes, "If we were to drop the normative aspect from psychological explana- tions, they would no longer serve the purposes they do.. .Physics, on the other hand, has as an aim of developing laws that are as complete and precise as we can make them; a different aim" (Davidson, 1991a, p. 163). And, this is why Davidson says, "[w]hen we try to understand the world as physicists, we necessarily employ our own norms, but we do not aim to discover rationality in the phenomena" (Davidson, 1991a, p. 162). This is why Davidson also rightly holds that, "we cannot turn [psychological] explanation into something more like science." (Davidson, 1980a, p. 233, 1987b, p. 42-43). A CAUSE FOR CONCERN: REASONS, CAUSES AND EXPLANATION 387</page><page sequence="8">long as we concern ourselves with the perspectives of agents our practice of citing reasons to explain actions propositional attitude psychology will not develop into a nomological science (cf. Lennon, 1992, Tanney, 1995, p. 118, Johnson, 1998, p. 45-47). When we explain ourselves by appeal to reasons we do not have, and cannot hope for, a closed system for the assignment of psychological episodes such that it could be suitably reduced to a system of psychological laws. To get such laws we would have to completely abandon (or alter) the enterprise of commonsense psychology. If this correct, then it should not surprise us that we must be content to talk of reasons causing a subject's behaviour and actions, as we often do, without being able to iden- tify such causal relations by appeal to the standard regularity criterion, with- out our knowing any psychophysical laws, and even without the prospect of such laws ever being developed.10 Laws are the province of some of the natu- ral sciences - they are not part of the understanding of one another we gain by interpreting each other as reasoned agents (cf. Hutto, 1997, p. 70-71).11 Once again the point is that since Davidson steadfastly denies that the reason (which is also the cause) is discernible from the naturalistic perspec- tive, he robs it of the explanatory role of eliminating competing hypothesis which is a crucial part of genuinely causal investigations. As long as the reason for acting is designated with deference to the agent, as opposed to giv- ing an impersonal analysis, then labelling the reason as the cause does no discriminatory labour. Davidson's account is not, on this score, any advance on Melden's since he is rightly unwilling to embrace a more thorough-going naturalism. On the issue of how the reason for action is initially identified, Davidson shows himself to be in substantial agreement with the neo-Wittgensteinians.12 Hence treating the 'because' in reason-attributions as indicating a 'causal rela- tion' doesn't provide a means of solving the primary reason problem. But the situation is worse than this for causalism can be misleading on this score. The causalist story tends to direct attention away from what is truly impor- tant in the study of reason-explanations because it doesn't advertise its impotency to deal with the primary reason problem on its sleeve. To deal properly with that problem we might consider Julia Tanney's proposal. She 10 In this respect, despite insisting that reason-explanations are causal explanations we must bear in mind that Davidson also tells us that, "[w]e can explain behaviour without having to know too much about how it was caused..." (Davidson, 1980a, p. 233). 1 The special features of psychological interpretation led Wittgenstein to treat reason- explanations as 'further descriptions' or 'elucidations' rather than causal hypotheses (cf. Coiffi, 1991, p. 172-73). His view on this matters is valuable because it reminds us that we do not appeal to the methods of sciences like physiology or neurology when deciding why it is that someone acts. 12 If this is correct then other than noting a change in the size and colour of Routledge monographs, Lepore and Loewer may be premature in their prediction of the death of red-book philosophy. 388 DANIEL HUTTO</page><page sequence="9">claims that, "The 'something that is missing' from the primary reason account is, if anything, a more complex interpretation that would include competing reasons, values, judgements manifesting choices, and so on, and no doubt this interpretation will be dependent on what the agent is disposed to say about his own actions" (Tanney, 1995, p. 114). This is not the place to explore or develop this idea, but I find in congenial to the kind of narrative proposal I have begun to develop (cf. Hutto, 1997). 3. The Mysterious Connection Problem We have now repelled one apparent reason for dissatisfaction with non-causal- ism by establishing that appeal to the causal character of reason-explanations gives no explanatory edge in solving the 'primary reason problem'. But this was never the true function of such an appeal. As Child notes, "The point of the argument for a causal view is not that we must appeal to causation in order to tell whether S ('-d for one reason rather than another; it is, rather, that we must appeal to causation in order to understand the metaphysics of the relation between reason and action" (Child, 1994, p. 96, second emphasis mine). The real motivation for regarding reason-explanations as a species of causal explanation that it helps to solve the 'mysterious connection' problem by placing reasons into a familiar metaphysical and explanatory framework. Hence, having decided which belief/desire pair describes the reason for acting we simply claim it is connected to the consequent action by a causal relation. But, on its own, appeal to an unreduced causal relation of this kind doesn't solve any mysteries. Things only improve if we regard reasons as causes and can successfully incorporate this view into a wider metaphysical account. Such an account must reveal that reason-explanations are, in at least one important sense, the same as other causal explanations. But it must do so without threatening their autonomy or ignoring any of their special features. Davidson offers just such an account in the form of a token identity theory which enables us to hold that one and the same event can have 'mental' and physical descriptions.'3 But it is not necessary that descriptions will ever form part of a coherent, unified conceptual framework. If we accept the idea that mental descriptions pick out particular events which can be redescribed in the language of an ideal physics then it is possible to adopt a weak version of the Humean view about the nature and explanation of causal relations.'4 A subscriber to such a view accepts, "that 'A caused B' entails that there exists a causal law instantiated by some true descriptions of A and B" (Davidson, 1980a, p. 16, emphasis mine). Davidson's purpose in adopting this reading is to show that, "it does not follow that we are able to dredge up a law if we 13 I use the label 'mental' for ease of exposition but it is a use of which I am suspicious (cf. Hutto, 1995b). 14 To use J. J. C. Smart's words, the token identity theorist is, "using 'is' in the sense of strict identity.. .there is one thing" (Davidson, 1980a, p. 212). A CAUSE FOR CONCERN: REASONS, CAUSES AND EXPLANATION 389</page><page sequence="10">know a singular causal statement to be true; all that follows is that there must be a covering law" (Davidson, 1980a, p. 160). He believes the covering law we require can be provided under an entirely different description of the events in question. Events simpliciter enter into causal relations even if such relations are only truly (or fully) explained under certain descriptions. Moreover, Davidson famously argues that acceptance of such an identity theory is the only way to consistently hold the following three orthodox principles: (i) Principle of the Causal Interaction of the Mental: Some mental events cause, and are caused by, physical events. (ii) Principle of the Nomological Character of Causality: Each true sin- gular causal statement is backed by a strict law connecting events of kinds to which events mentioned as cause and effect belong. (iii) Principle of the Anomalousness of the Mental: propositional atti- tude psychology is normative and cannot make appeal to homo- nomic laws (Davidson, 1980a, p. 233).15 Before moving on, it is useful to clarify Davidson's position on one point. He has, occasionally, tried to motivate acceptance of his token identity view by appeal to the idea that psychological domain is dependent on the physical. For example, he once wrote, "...although I am urging that, psycho- logical characteristics cannot be reduced to the ... [physical, biological, physi- ological], nevertheless they may be (and I think they are) strongly dependent on them. Indeed, there is a sense in which the physical characteristics of an event determine the psychological characteristics" (Davidson, 1980a, p. 253, emphasis mine). Furthermore, he has appealed to the notion of supervenience to clarify the nature of this non-reductive relationship of dependency (cf. also Kim, 1978, 1979, 1982, 1984a, 1984b, 1990). Unfortunately, there has been some confusion in the literature as to the exact nature of supervenience rela- tionships and what they entail. This is because the concept admits of several interpretations, some stronger than others.16 15 Davidson defines homonomic and heteronomic as follows: a homonomic generalization is one which could be improved, with provisos, within the same general vocabulary while a heteronomic generalization is one with an ineliminable ad hoc character-and for which the precise law must be stated in a different vocabulary (Davidson, 1980a, p. 219). 16 As David Charles notes, "There is clearly a dense spectrum of supervenience relations ... [and].. .Davidson's formulation is a 'broad church' one with very many possibilities left open" (Charles, 1992, p. 269). Nor are the strong and weak ways of characterizing the concept exhaustive. For example, global supervenience has also emerged as a popu- lar means of explicating the concept of supervenience (cf. Petrie, 1987, Paull &amp; Sider, 1992). For a critical assessment of global supervenience see Kim (1987), Heil (1992) and Moser (1992). 390 DANIEL HUTTO</page><page sequence="11">Strong psychophysical supervenience has been characterised as the view that, "...no two possible events (objects, states) can agree in all physical characteristics and differ in some mental characteristic" (McLaughlin, 1985, p. 360). However, this unrelativised version of supervenience is quite strong, since it implies that one could distinguish supervenient properties solely in terms of subvenient (i.e. physical) properties across all possible worlds and times. This implies the theoretically possibility of predicting the occurrence of a mental event, knowing nothing other than what was going on at the physical level. Since Davidson has explicitly ruled out the possibility of such predictions he regards strong supervenience being too strong.' Given this, some non-reductionists suggest that the psychophysical relationship should be understood in terms of weak supervenience (cf. Haugeland, 1982, Seager, 1988). Weak supervenience is standardly defined as the view that, "...there is no possible world in which two events (objects, states) in that world agree in all their physical characteristics and differ in some mental characteristic" (McLaughlin, 1985, p. 360).8 This way of characterising weak supervenience makes the relation between the psychological and the physical looser and is therefore, comparatively, more promising. On this construal psychological properties can vary in their relations to physical properties across possible worlds. But, to continue with this 'three bears' saga, some have complained that weak supervenience is too weak since it remains, "...silent about across- world comparisons" (Heil, 1992, p. 69). Unless it is qualified in important ways, it permits the existence of physically (or metaphysically) possible worlds with no mental events at all, but in which the physical facts are iden- tical to this one. The problem is that unchecked talk of 'physically possible' 17 If strong supervenience really were the proper way to understand the psychophysical relation, then the materialist, given his preference for purely 'objective' explanations should press for what Johnston calls exhaustive monism, which is the view that, "physical facts exhaust all the facts" (Johnston, 1985, p. 417). Some philosophers are willing to accept and stand by this consequence (cf. Heil, 1992, Kim, 1987). Others have claimed that the 'reductive reading' is allegedly only one, albeit common, reading of strong supervenience. As Charles points out, "Strong supervenience does not entail reduction if one holds to a conservative, scientifically useful notion of property" (Charles, 1992, p. 271). 18 Weak supervenience apparently makes better sense of the relationship which Davidson had in mind, since his paradigm of a non-reductive version of supervenience is "the supervenience of semantic predicates on syntactic predicates: a truth predicate for a lan- guage cannot distinguish any sentences not distinguishable in purely syntactic terms" (Davidson, 1990c, p. 1, cf. Davidson., 1985b). Semantic/syntax supervenience is a case of weak supervenience because we know, for example, that the syntactic properties of a word might relate to different semantic properties (e.g. there are worlds where English remains mostly the same except for the fact that 'CAT' means dog). As McLaughlin says, "The supervenience of truth on syntax is surely a case of weak supcrvenience: in any world, if two sentences in a language are syntactically indiscernible, the one is true if and only if the other is true. But obviously the truth value of many sentences can vary from one world to another." (McLaughlin, 1985, p. 365). A CAUSE FOR CONCERN: REASONS, CAUSES AND EXPLANATION 391</page><page sequence="12">worlds in the context of supervenience claims is not useful (cf. Seager, 1988, p. 705-7, Crane and Mellor, 1990, p. 203-5). Although some concerns about the plausibility of Davidson's anomalous monism have focused on his interpretation of the supervenience relation I believe this attention is misguided. For any fruitful discussion of super- venience, one which invokes the machinery of possible worlds, requires talk of relationships between types of events. Even though the talk is of logically possible worlds in which the same event occurs, it encourages us to imagine a world like this one but different in certain material respects. But Davidson is adamant that his account only concerns token events which are individuated by means of spatio-temporal occurrence. This ties them uniquely to a series of other physical events both past and future (cf. Davidson, 1993, p. 15). Hence, if we are speaking of individual, unique events of this kind then it makes no sense to imagine the same event, in another possible world, having different mental properties but the same physical ones (cf. Buekens, 1997). According to Davidson, to do so would be to imagine a different event altogether. In a recent attempt to make his views about supervenience clearer he writes, "the idea I had in mind is, I think, most economically expressed as follows: a predicate p is supervenient on a set of properties S if and only if p does not distinguish any entities that cannot be distinguished by S" (Davidson, 1993, p. 4)19 Certainly, as he points out, this reading implies monism and is consistent with a token identity theory (cf. Buekens, 1997). In fact, it is just another way of expressing that thesis. Hence, given Davidson's idiosyncratic understanding of the supervenience claim his account is best understood solely in terms of token identity. But even in this form anomalous monism has been subject to the criti- cism that, despite advertisements to the contrary, it makes mental properties epiphenomenal.20 For example, Honderich has argued that it is only by men- tioning certain law-like properties that we can fully explain the causal rela- tions between events. The general form of the critique goes like this: if we accept the principle of the nomological character of causality (hereafter, PNCC), as Davidson explicitly does, then it is only the law-like physical 19 Davidson is credited with having been the first to introduce the notion of supervenience into the philosophy of mind. But his main concern was merely to support his token identity theory. Thus, in a reply to Harry Lewis, he wrote that when he introduced supervenience "what I was arguing for ...was only the identity of mental events with physical events. I wanted to emphasize that such ontological reduction does not imply that mental properties are physical properties, nor that there are causal or bridging laws relating events classed by mental properties with events classed by physical properties" (Davidson, 1985b, p. 243-44, emphasis mine). 20 This criticism has been raised by several philosophers (Honderich (1982-84), Kim (1984, 1993), Sosa (1984, 1993), Johnston (1985), Fodor (1990b), Evnine, (1991), McLaughlin (1993)). I discuss it and Davidson's possible weak and strong versions of the extension reply in (Hutto, 1998a). 392 DANIEL HUTTO</page><page sequence="13">properties of an event which explain its causal potency. Thus, being anoma- lous, the contentful properties of an event are both impotent and explanato- rily irrelevant. Davidson is standardly presented with the dilemma asking him to say either that (a) the mental causally interacts with the physical in nomological fashion or (b) not at all. He has replied that his critics have misunderstood his views concerning the extensional nature of causal relations and the intensional character of causal explanations. In advancing this line he claims that talk of causal rela- tions between properties is a red herring. For although we may wish to men- tion various properties when giving certain types of causal explanations when we speak of two particular events as causally related it is senseless to speak of them as being related in virtue of this or that set of properties. That is to say the very same event (at time t, place p) which is picked out as my reason for acting is also the same event (at time t, place p) which enters into an nomic explanation in physical discourse. But the way in which we pick out the event matters not to the causal relations that hold between the events in extension. Causal relations hold between events simpliciter even if certain facts are only fully explained when the events in question are presented under certain descriptions. On this view it would appear that the problem of the causal impotency of mental properties no longer arises given that it is the events themselves that stand in casually related to one another, and they do not do so in virtue of their various properties (cf. McLaughlin, 1993, p. 23). Causal relations are, as it were, primitive. This is what licenses Davidson's claim that, "if causality is a relation between events, then it holds between them no matter how they are described" (Davidson, 1993, p. 6). I call this his extension reply'. However, there are two ways to read the 'extension reply'; one weaker and one stronger. On the 'weak' reading although we can accept that two events are causally related in extension we have no clue why such a relation holds between them. If we understand 'events in extension' in this way it implies that, in any given case, the fact that a causal relation holds between two events is an essentially mysterious, brute fact. For this reason McLaughlin notes that causal relations are not accounted for by Davidson at all, given that he, "would deny that events are causally related in virtue of falling under strict laws." (McLaughlin, 1993, p. 35, cf. also McLaughlin, 1993, p. 32, Kim, 1993, p. 22, and Sosa, 1993, p. 42, emphasis mine). In light of his token identity solution it is clear why Davidson must take this line. Laws are intensional, hence although in certain contexts they are supposed to give us a full explanation of causal relations they cannot make an appearance 'ontologically speaking'. However, as I have elsewhere argued, endorsing this version of the exten- sion reply on its own does not justify acceptance of the PNCC (cf. Hutto, 1998a, p. 51-55). And it is the PNCC which is meant to provide an explana- A CAUSE FOR CONCERN: REASONS, CAUSES AND EXPLANATION 393</page><page sequence="14">tory link which in turn provides the solution to the mysterious connection problem. But, unless we have an independent reason to accept the PNCC why should we believe that there is always a law at work, under some description, which can explain causal connections. The independent reason which David- son supplies is in the form of his cause-law thesis. The 'cause-law' thesis insists, on Kantian grounds, that, "we know in advance of evidence.. .that if a singular causal claim is true, there is a law that backs it, and we can know this without knowing what the law is" (Davidson, 1995, p. 264). 21 But this is too strong. The problem for Davidson's larger project is that if we were to accept such a strong, a priori necessary conceptual connection between causes and laws (as the cause-law thesis demands) on what grounds could, or should, we deny that events in extension are connected to one another in virtue of their law-like properties when they are causally related? The a priori nature of the 'cause-law' thesis, combined with Davidson's view that a logical analysis of language is an accurate guide to metaphysics, encourages, if not implies a stronger, unworkable version of the extension reply. For it is true, as McLaughlin notes, that even if we accepted the extension reply in spirit we could specify which properties of events underwrite causal relations. He points out that even if, "causal relations are extensional relations between events [this] is straightforwardly compatible with the claim that when events are causally related, they are so in virtue of something about each" (McLaughlin, 1993, p. 32). Therefore, we might ask, along with Kim, "What is it about events c and e that makes it the case that c is the cause of e?" (Kim, 1993, p. 22). Given Davidson's commitment to the cause-law thesis, it may appear that a metaphysical version of PNCC is the obvious candidate for answering this question since it is possible to advocate a stronger version of the extension reply and hold that events are causal related in extension insofar as they are related in virtue of certain law-like properties. This would automatically justify Davidson's view that when we say that events are causally related we are universally committed to the idea that there is a law which explains this connection available under some description. But this simply resurrects the original charge of epiphenomenalism by making the mental aspects of an event causally impotent. Furthermore, a commitment to this kind of hard physicalism opens up very serious questions about the ontological status of the propositional attitudes. It is difficult to see how such phenomena could maintain any 'reality rights' in a universe that, when truly and completely described, was wholly deterministic. For example, if the world, in extension, is just the world of ideal physics and all causal relations are strictly law-like then the possibility of content would be ruled 21 It is important to note that, "the reason for holding the cause-law thesis.. .must in some sense be a priori, for the thesis is not a pronouncement of ordinary logic, nor can it be established empirically..." (Davidson, 1995, p. 264). 394 DANIEL HUTTO</page><page sequence="15">out because the possibility of misrepresentation would be ruled out, and thereby the possibility of representation itself. Even Fodor has recognised that it is a 'formal feature' of any account of representation that it must have an anomic character as described by the asymmetric dependency theory of content. This is also why Davidson rightfully employs an 'unreduced' notion of cause in his interpretation theory (cf. Hutto, 1996, p. 138-39). For this reason the only technically sustainable move, compatible with non-reductionism, is to adopt the weak reading. However, that reading leaves the nature of causal relations mysterious. Hence, if we are seeking a princi- pled account of why a reason and action are connected then Davidson is bound to disappoint. At most we know simply that they are. Thus, causalist claims to the side, the problem of the connection between reason and action remains, as ever, a cause for concern. 4. The Mysterious Connection Problem Reconsidered In conclusion, it is worth emphasising that Davidson's primary motivation for a causalist treatment of 'because' in reason-explanations derives from his admiration of Aristotle's account of action. He explicitly says, it is Aristotle who, "...introduc[es] the concept of wanting as a causal factor" (Davidson, 1980a, p. 11, cf. also Davidson, 1987b, p. 40). Moreover, he has claimed, "...I would urge that, failing a satisfactory alternative, the best argument for a scheme like Aristotle's is that it alone promises to give an account of the 'mysterious connection' between reasons and actions" (Davidson, 1980a, p. 11). But the way in which the mysterious connection problem would have been dealt with by Aristotle is a far cry from the way in which it is handled when one assumes a Humean-based vision of causation-even a weak one (cf. Johnston, 1989, p. 46). To ally oneself with Aristotle on the issue of the way in which reasons are causes is to re-enforce the idea that 'reasons' gain their explanatory force by consideration of the agent and not by any reconciliation with an impersonal causal perspective.22 It is useful to remember that Aristotelian causes and their modes of explanation are not causal in the modern sense of the term.23 We can note this and, without 22 The irony is that Ricoeur offers the Aristotelian position, which gives persons a privileged place in action-theory, as a viable alternative to Davidson's approach. He writes, "Aristotle, well before the Stoics, made it apparent that action depends on the agent, in a specific sense of the relation of dependence.. .How, on this basis the relation of action to agent to be stated? The most concise expression of this relation is found in a formula that makes the agent the principle (archer) of his actions, but in a sense of archer that authorises us to say that the actions depend on (preposition epi) the agent himself (aut6) (E.N. 3.1110al7)" (Ricoeur, 1992, pp. 89-90). 23 It is important to remind ourselves that Melden was explicit about the nature of his target, "I am concerned with 'cause' either in the Humean sense of this term or, if this is alleged to be inadequate in certain respects, the use of the term in scientific explanations of, say, physical or physiological events, in that sense of the term in which it is in fact employed in physics or physiology" (Melden, 1961, p. 16). A CAUSE FOR CONCERN: REASONS, CAUSES AND EXPLANATION 395</page><page sequence="16">necessarily seeking to resurrect Aristotle's position in all its glory, use it as a ground to endorse the kind of conclusion that Gordon reaches. He writes: I am inclined to say that the 'because' in reason explanations indicates a 'causal' relation, but not in the same sense as in a naturalistic explanation of, say, a tree's being split. Rather, the relation is 'causal' in the original 'primitive' sense of 'cause', as Collingwood (1946) and Strawson (1985) have urged. (Gordon, 1992, p. 30). What is the primitive sense of cause to which Gordon refers? To answer this we might seriously consider Strawson's proposal that our knowledge of causality derives, in the first instance, from our ability to imaginatively project ourselves into the world (cf. Strawson, 1985, p. 123, 1992, p. 118). Strawson rejects the Humean account which links the development of the concept of cause to our intellectual habits in response to the passive observa- tion of constant conjunctions between kind of events. Instead he suggests this concept has its roots in our experience of 'knocking into' things and being 'knocked into'.24 In other words, his view is that our basic notions of causa- tion may stem from the phenomenological effects of our own practical engagement with a world - from a sense of felt 'external' force and our resis- tance to such forces in the carrying out of our projects.25 Initial attempts to extend the notion of cause to inanimate things would have, at least initially, involved a projection of human-like agency onto those things.26 Strawson's analysis of the origin of the concept of causality is interesting because it recognises and highlights the anthropomorphic basis of the concept. Saying this is not to ignore that the concept of causation has be employed elsewhere to deal with the alien effects and behaviour of the interactions between things impersonal, inanimate and microscopic (Strawson, 1985, p. 124-25, 1992, p. 120).27 It is only to recognise that such uses should not be confused with a 24 When Strawson asks, from what impression do we derive our original notion of causality, he suggests that, "the most obvious answer relates to the experience we have of exerting force on physical things or having force exerted on us by physical things" (Strawson, 1985, p. 122, 1992, p. 117). 25 This is interesting in connection with Horgan's criticism that non-causalist approaches do not tally with, "the phenomenology of our own agency" (Horgan, 1991, p. 88). He claims that agents have introspective awareness of the causal potency of their own mental states. Dretske has replied by saying that Horgan's view that there are 'here and now' mental causes appears to based more on a 'Davidsonian dogma' than on an introspective fact (cf. Dretske, 1991, p. 198). But if we adopt the Strawsonian line there is a way to accommodate such a view without accepting the a Davidsonian, Humean-style vision of causation. 26 Again, as Strawson writes, "In a great boulder rolling down the mountainside and flattening the hut in its path we see an exemplary instance of force; and perhaps, in so seeing it, we are in some barely coherent way, identifying with the hut (if we are one kind of person) or with the boulder (if we are another): putting ourselves imaginatively in the place of one or the other" (Strawson, 1985, p. 123, 1992, p. 118, emphasis mine). This ties it, in part, with proposals made by some simulation theorists (cf. Hutto, 1997). 27 This fits with what we know about the historical development of our attempts to under- stand ourselves and the natural world. Strawson tell us, "Our primitive, and not so primi- 396 DANIEL HUTTO</page><page sequence="17">more primitive basis of the concept of cause which better suits accounts of our agency. Moreover, such a conception reveals that the connection between reasons and action is not a puzzle to be solved.28 Looking at things in this light aborts the mysterious connection problem before it can develop. The key to understanding the nature of reason-explanations is not to treat them as if they were on par with other forms of causal explanation used else- where, particularly those of the natural sciences. This should give us pause to ask: Ought we think of reason explanations as causal in any sense? Certainly, even noting their normative character, reason explanations are still suggestive of counterfactual patterns of behaviour. Offering a reason to explain an action sets up all sorts of defeasible, ceteris paribus expectations about how the agent ought to behave (cf. Hutto, 1997, 70-72). For if an agent fails to behave in a consistent way we would be forced us to reassess our interpreta- tion of them. But if it is only to this extent that there is a parallel with causal explanation in the impersonal, naturalistic sense then we have little reason to call reasons causes or to think that much of their explanatory force derives from their capacity to provide causal explanations.29 For, if the analy- sis of this paper is correct, doing so neither solves (i) the primary reason problem nor (ii) the mysterious connection problem.

In fact, there seems to be a basic Unity to all uses of causal con- cepts. An examination of ordinary discourse, psychological or otherwise, reveals that by ,cause' we simply mean "that which produces an effect". As Anscombe says: "There is something to observe here, that lies under our noses. It is little attended to, and yet still so obvious as to seem trite. It is this: causality consists in the derivativeness of an effect from its causes. This is the core, the common feature, of causality in its various kincs. Effects derive from, arise out of, their causes" (Anscombe, 1981, p. 136, emphasis mine). 29 As Melden wrote, "It is certainly true that we use 'cause' in speaking about the actions of agents, but we can no more infer from this verbal consideration that actions are the Humean effects of events than we can from the etymological derivation of the term ,motive"' (Melden, 1961, p. 208).
