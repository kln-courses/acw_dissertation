<plain_text><page sequence="1">Listen to the Crows. Laurence Pringle. 34pp. $5.95. Thomas Y. Crowell Com- pany, Inc., 666 Fifth Ave., New York Ci- ty 10019. 1976. (Grades 3-5) The many calls of the crow are detailed in Listen to the Crows. Various calls are described in terms of the needs of the crows such as the assembly call, the warning, the dispersal, and the calls of the young. The author includes the investigations of several scientists who have studied and interpreted the sounds of the crow. In addition, some members of the crow family are identified and their habitats and adaptations dis- cussed. The book points out the cleverness of the crow; in describing this intelligence, the author sometimes appears to border on anthropomorphism. Alice J. Moses</page></plain_text>
