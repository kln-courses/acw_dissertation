<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL OF BIBLE AND RELIGION Vol. XIX January, i95i No. i THE CHRISTIAN IMPERATIVE FLOYD H. ROSS* In a recent discussion of the Christian mis- sionary enterprise, a writer in the Christian Century stated: "Above all, Christianity should not forget that it alone has the divine promise."' This has been a common assump- tion underlying much missionary work. Let us assume for the moment that the assumption is entirely false. We shall then properly label it an example of straightforward dogmatic affirmation which is no more self- evident to a non-Christian than the Roman Catholic dogma of the primacy of Peter is self-evident to a non-Catholic. Dogmatic af- firmations are only self-evident to those people who already believe because of other factors which are rarely articulated. Even if the dogma be true, there is no way of establishing it em- pirically. And whether true or untrue, this is a dangerous era in which to shout "special chosenness" from the housetops. While it may have been the standard formula of many Chris- tian writers in the past, it indicates defensive- ness regarding beliefs in God but a paucity of faith in God. If we surrender the absoluteness of Chris- tianity and approach history with the assump- tion that grace is in all history (as Berdyaev and Tillich are frank to admit), have we sur- rendered all grounds for effective missionary activity? The answer would seem to be a clear no. We simply place ourselves in a situation where we can take all history seriously. Most Christian philosophers talk about taking history seriously: it turns out that what they actually mean is to take only one segment of history seriously-namely, Jewish-Christian history. Some of the earlier Christian teachers began to feel their way out of this unhealthy egocentric predicament; such as Justin Martyr, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Theodore of Mop.suestia, and John Scotus Erigena. But they were swimming against the ecclesiastical current, and several were belatedly served with weighty anathemas years after they were in their graves. The others were ignored. When non-Semitic categories were finally made a definite part of the medieval synthesis in the form of Christianized Aristotelianism, they were carefully subordinated to the Semitic and juristic categories of Rome, and the church went on claiming that Christianity alone had the divine promise. This is to take neither history nor God seriously. There is no overwhelming evidence that God works through any one historical channel, or idiom, or tradition more potently than through others. Who of us dares to try to measure such imponderables? Indeed there is ample evidence that the God of history works through no one of our experiences or traditions with anything like transparency. There is a place in every life for admitting that man sees through a glass darkly. All history is value-laden, showing marks of teleology, of purposive growth, of new creations, of rebirth. And all history is laden with dis-values, irrational surds, unre- solved contradictions. This means we are all co-seekers, co-finders, co-workers. Thus in principle, the grounds of Christian missionary activity are no different * Head of the Department of Religion and Professor of Church History and World Religions in the School of Religion of the University of Southern California. 3</page><page sequence="2">4 FLOYD H. ROSS from the grounds of non-Christian missionary activity. Each religion has its own genius and its own idiosyncracies. Each is the result of a kind of divine-human encounter: historical fac- tors, personal struggles, cosmic confrontation, human needs and human aspirations. Each group feels it has something to offer. Each group also has something to learn. There are human needs to be met, but no one way of meeting them. In the give-and-take processes of human togetherness, man finds something of meaning, purpose, God. Life comes into clearer focus for a person whenever certain subjective and objective conditions converge (i.e., are "right"). There is no evidence that any religion or religious symbol has a corner on the ability to produce or encourage such a coming into focus. When we deal with gener- alities, we may think we see significant con- trasts; when we become more specific, it is hard to prove a case (especially in view of the human tendency to see the virtues of our own religion as central but the virtues of the other man's religion as peripheral). But what of the alleged uniqueness of Chris- tianity? Every movement, in a sense, like every person, is unique. But every person is most unique when he is least self-conscious about comparison with other selves. Herein lies the danger in all attempts to prove the superiority of Christianity over other religions. All com- parisons must be quite tentative, exploratory, and made with an explicit recognition on the part of the comparer that it makes a lot of difference with what purpose one compares, or from what angle he points his camera. I illus- trate by reference to the issue of personalism versus impersonalism. It is commonly asserted that Christianity's superior virtue lies in the fact that it is personalistic whereas the religions of the Orient are impersonalistic. A minimum non-controversial answer to the Christian the- ologian at this point might well be: it depends upon what aspects of human experience you are interested in throwing light on at any particular moment. A Christian psychothera- pist, dealing with an emotionally distraught person, might interpose a demurrer. The neu- rotic personality, in our culture at least, is a person who has failed at the level of his per- sonal relatedness-his relatedness to himself, to parents, to business associates, to his God. He peoples his universe with personal forces but in a sick fashion. He "personalizes" the restricting or frustrating factors in a thor- oughly subjective, egocentric way; he has re- verted to the level of animism. This "person- alizing" process may express itself in a wide variety of ways: conceptualizations of evil spirits, evil-intentioned persons, or just as pos- sibly in self-deprecatory assertions of guilt, depravity, or sinfulness. In a culture condi- tioned by Semitic categories of over-per- sonalized theism, the sick person feels an aggravated sense of alienation from the Father- God. To such a person, a personal God is initially no help but a threat. Personalistic theism, with its rich anthropomorphic imagery gives to a Paul, an Augustine, or a Luther a bundle of emotionally-freighted concepts which only intensifies the struggling soul's emotional instability. I refer to such typical judgmental- juristic concepts as sin, guilt, judgment, blame, condemnation, merit, satisfaction, justifica- tion. Such externalized transactional categories can hardly creatively promote emotional health and spiritual stability which at bottom are matters of coherence, integration, healthy internalization, relatedness. Interpersonal relations can be redeemed ap- parently only through a de-personalizing or re-personalizing process, which starts with a discarding of projected animistic and person- alistic categories (categories which, in their emotional overtones at least, would seem to be more a reflection of emotional confusion and an inability to relate oneself personally to other selves in creative ways than an objective at- tempt at describing the nature of ultimate reality). One must gain enough insight to uti- lize the resources which are quite naturally his, and one must leave off taking refuge in elaborate conceptualizations of the outside forces which are allegedly holding him back. The more ma- ture a person becomes, the less he will tend either to manipulate other selves or God, or</page><page sequence="3">THE CHRISTIAN IMPERATIVE 5 seek solace through sacrificing his will to the will of another (even the "Will of God"). Furthermore, as one's individual life comes into clearer focus in terms of mundane personal interrelationships, there is a lessening of the internal pressures which lead one to attempt definitive formulations regarding allegedly per- sonal powers in the cosmos, or to lean upon personalized cosmic sheltering arms. In other words, from the standpoint of psychotherapy, the concept of the Law of Karma (a law of cause and effect relationships) may have more instrumental value than the concept of a per- sonalized God.2 It may even lay the foundation for a "doctrine of grace" much more profound or functionally relevant than that provided by Semitic-Romanized categories of jurispru- dence. If the above comments have any validity at all, they illustrate my initial comment re- garding superiority; viz., alleged superiority is always relative to a specific context, and to the needs of specific persons at specific stages in their own spiritual unfoldment. The religious quest-the human quest-is for wholeness of life. Every vital religious tradi- tion provides or at least suggests plural ways of attacking the problem of self-actualization, God-realization, salvation (call it what you need to). The Hindus long ago recognized three distinct types of approaches (karma yoga, bhakti yoga, jnana yoga). Each approach, tech- nique, or vehicle is of value only to the extent that it serves as an instrument of further growth. Hence there can be no such thing as an absolute theology or an absolute religion. Every religion to the extent that it encourages vital exploration in the life of the spirit will precipitate significant processes in the other religions with which it comes into contact. A generous exchange of honest seekers between the various religions is thus highly desirable. Kafka wrote: "All human error is impa- tience, a premature renunciation of method, a delusive pinning down of a delusion." To para- phrase Lao-tze, man needs to become sick of his sickness, the attempt at formulating final answers. If the human quest is for wholeness or God, it is not too important what partial signposts or symbols we use along the way to stake out our own path. For in any case it is a pilgrimage of the faithful, and not a pilgrimage of "the Faith." REFERENCES 1 The Christian Century, p. 1104. Article, "Paganism Unshaken in Japan," by R. A.
