<plain_text><page sequence="1">KEVIN BROWNLEE Pygmalion, Mimesis, and the Multiple Endings of the Roman de la Rose* In the present essay, I would like to suggest that Jean de Meun's Roman de la Rose contains a series of three different, though complementary, endings. Each figures an act of sexual fulfillment, but in qualitatively different terms with regard to mimesis, discourse, poetics, and "ideol- ogy." Jean's conjoined Rose text thus effects closure by a multiplicity of closures, by a sequential metamorphosis of closure, presented as such. The basic model for this complex effectuation of an ending is, I suggest, profoundly Ovidian. On the one hand, it is initiated by Jean's citation and remaniement of a privileged Ovidian fable of artistic and erotic success, that of Pygmalion from Metamorphoses 10. On the other, there is Jean's use of metamorphosis as an Ovidian composi- tional principle, one that had functioned in Ovid's epic as the basic means of establishing narrative boundaries, units, and components, at the level of the work's multifaceted "/plot."' Let me begin by enumerating the three endings of Jean's Rose in summary form. First, we have the famous intercalated Ovidian narra- tive of Pygmalion and Galatea (11. 20817-1183 ).2 Here an image is first *Earlier versions of this essay were presented at Cambridge University (March, 1995), Rutgers University (April, 1997), and the MLA Convention (Toronto, December, 1997).

Second, we have the account of how the Rose's protagonist, figured as a pilgrim, arrives before a different (and different kind of) image, located on the wall of Jealousy's Castle. The sanctuary, whose entrance lies between the pillars supporting this image, is then penetrated by the pilgrim's staff (11.21346-672).4 In this case, the mimesis of desire is "metaphoric": both the acting male subject and the female object of desire are repre- sented as figures of speech. A metaphor for the male genitalia couples with a metaphor for the female genitalia. Finally, we have the plucking of the rose (11. 21673-742; 21775-79). Here the mimesis of desire is "hybrid": an anthropomorphic male subject takes possession of a con- cretized floral metaphor for the female object of desire.5 says in Honor of Louis Francis Solano, ed.

The point of departure for reading these as functions of each other is the mimetically hybrid status of the Rose's basic plot line as inherited by Jean from Guillaume de Lorris. In Guillaume's love story, the male desiring subject is represented as a human being (Amant, the first- person courtly lover), while the female object of desire is represented by a flower (the rose, a concretized metaphor at the level of the ro- mance's plot). This fundamental mimetic disjunction is presented (within the fiction of the text) as deriving from the status of the ex- tradiegetic Lady of Guillaume-author, the twenty-five year old poet who is in the process of writing down the dream he had had five years earlier, a literary enterprise he undertakes in order to gain the favor of "cele qui tant a de pris / e tant est dine d'estre amee / qu'ele doit estre Rose clamee" [she who is so precious and so worthy to be loved that she should be called Rose] (11. 42-44; 31). The root metaphor of Guil- laume-author's extradiegetic love relationship ("my Lady is like a rose") is rewritten intradiegetically as an equivalency, a statement of identity: "My Lady is a rose." The constraints imposed by the system of courtly discourse and ideology assumed by Guillaume-author make narrative closure impossible. The picking of the flower by the Lover at the level of Guillaume's plot (for Guillaume-protagonist in the past) would figure a successful outcome to the love suit in which Guillaume- author presents himself as engaged, in the present. The representation of this amorous success would presumptuously violate courtly rules and would invalidate the poem's status as an extended erotic speech act considered extradiegetically: as a request for the love of a putatively ex- tra-textual Lady.6 Guillaume's courtly poetics thus sets up a mimetically hybrid dis- course, in which the anthropomorphic male desiring subject has a con- cretized metaphor as his female object of desire: the economy of erotic desire is represented by a man in love with a flower. In addition, this same courtly poetics makes both narrative closure and sexual fulfill- 6. At the heart of this apparent impasse in Guillaume's text is the complex inter- play between lyric and narrative constructs first set in motion in the prologue. See Karl D. Uitti, "From Clerc to Poete: The Relevance of the Romance of the Rose to Machaut's World," in Machaut's World: Science and Art in the Fourteenth Century, ed. Madelaine Pelner Cosman and Bruce Chandler (New York: New York Academy of Sciences, 1978), 209-16; and "'Cele [qui] doit estre Rose clamee' (Rose, vv. 40-44): Guillaume's Inten- tionality" in Rethinking the "Romance of the Rose," 39-64.</page><page sequence="4">196 Yale French Studies ment equally impossible. The end of the story, the mimesis of satisfied desire, simply cannot be articulated within Guillaume's discursive sys- tem as established in his Rose text.7 In the present context I want to explore the rich series of ways in which Jean de Meun's continuation and expansion of Guillaume does finally succeed in simultaneously representing fulfilled desire and ef- fecting narrative closure. The overall context provided by the conjoined Rose text as a whole works to foreground the essential features of Jean's rewriting of Ovid's Pygmalion.8 All of these features are thus "overdetermined."9 I will fo- cus on five of them. First, there is the fact that Jean's Galatea speaks. Jean's female pro- tagonist utters a passage of direct discourse, unlike her Ovidian model (and unlike the necessarily silent rose of Guillaume de Lorris). Her ini- tial self-identification is particularly important in this regard, as she addresses Pygmalion by saying: "Douz amis . .. sui vostre amie" [Sweet lover, I am your lover] (1. 21156; 345). This sentence involves an utter- ance that is impossible in the discursive world of Guillaume's poem, where the rose cannot speak and Bel Accueil is masculine, at least with regard to grammatical gender. In addition, the fact that Jean's Galatea speaks serves to stress her status as an autonomous subject. At the same time, the interactive speech relationship between Jean's Galatea 7. The ending of Guillaume's Rose would thus have a double status: incomplete qua narrative, but "complete" qua lyric. See Hult, Self-Fulfilling Prophecies, 208-62; also see his insightful discussion of Guillaume's "allegory of incompletion," 167-74, cul- minating in the statement that "the impossibility of an overt ending generated from within seals the closure of [Guillaume's] Rose" (174). 8. I leave out of my present discussion the key first half of Jean's Pygmalion story (11. 20817-1072), the premetamorphosis section, with its elaborate staging of the limita- tions of mimetic art, for which see Roger Dragonetti, "Le 'Singe de Nature' dans le Ro- man de la Rose, " Travaux de linguistique et de litterature 16 (1978): 150-60. Jean's val- orization of Pygmalion qua artist figure is self-consciously informed (though not merely undermined) by his elaborate deployment of this topos. For a critique of the provocative issues of gendered desire and agency raised by Pygmalion's fabrication and worship of the statue, see Marilynn Desmond and Pamela Scheingorn, Disciplining the Gaze: The Cinematic Experience of Late Medieval Manuscript Culture: Christine de Pizan's "Epistre Othea" (forthcoming). Also significant in this context are the ways in which the postmetamorphosis segment of Jean's Pygmalion narrative complements, complicates, or even subverts the premetamorphosis segment in terms of the representation of gen- der roles. For a nuanced discussion of Jean's Pygmalion in terms of idolatry, desire, and art, see Camille, Gothic Idol, 318-33. 9. For the concept of overdetermination, see Michael Riffaterre, Text Production, trans. Terese Lyons (New York: Columbia University Press, 1983), 43-52.</page><page sequence="5">KEVIN BROWNLEE 197 and Pygmalion epitomizes this relationship with regard to both agency and desire. Second, what Galatea says here involves a striking illustration of a linguistic practice that has been elaborately and systematically under- mined throughout Jean's text until this point. For Galatea uses lan- guage fully and transparently to signify desire, thus exemplifying and valorizing the efficacy of linguistic referentiality. Previously, the lin- guistic norm in Jean's textual world has involved language used du- plicitously, as strategy, as disguise.'10 This had most emphatically been the case in the linguistic theory and practice of Faux Semblant, as well as in that of Ami and La Vieille.'11 For all three of these earlier charac- ters, language serves to conceal, to mask the inner self of the speaker. For Ami, courtly discourse in particular functions in this way. In Jean's text, Galatea's use of courtly discourse effects a positive inversion of Ami's systematically deceptive linguistic practice. It is also interesting to note in this context that language has con- sistently worked in Jean's poem as a means of deferring the consum- mation of erotic desire.12 In the special case of Galatea and Pygmalion, language works to effect the consummation of (sexual) desire. Third, this consummation involves an extraordinary reciprocity of desire, conveyed by the proliferation of third-person plural reflexive verbs with the prefix entre-: A ces paroles s'entralient, De leur amour s'entremercient, N'est joie qu'il ne s'entrefacent; Par grant amour lors s'entrembracent, 10. At the same time, the referential capacity of language had been profoundly in- terrogated as such, beginning with the famous discussion between Amant and Raison on the status of coilles.

(11. 21165-70] At these words they united themselves to each other and thanked each other for their love. There was no pleasure that they did not make for each other: they embraced one another in their great love and kissed each other as if they were two doves. They loved each other greatly; they gave each other great pleasure. [345] Fourth, closely linked to the reciprocity of desire in the erotic rela- tionship between Pygmalion and Galatea in Jean's text is what might be called the reciprocity of agency. By this I mean that Jean's two Ovid- ian lovers are shown to occupy simultaneously the positions of desir- ing subject and of object of desire. Their actantial relationship is bidi- rectional: it is a question of mutual inter-action within the economy of desire. This thematic is first introduced by Galatea's use of the term compaignie to characterize proleptically Pygmalion's desire for her: Douz amis ... sui vostre amie, Preste de vostre compaignie Receveir, e m'amour vous ofre, S'il vous plaist receveir tel ofre." [11. 21155-58, emphasis mine] Sweet lover, I am your lover, ready to receive your companionship and to offer you my love if it please you to receive such an offer. [345] Note the careful balance-syntactic, metrical, grammatical, and se- mantic-with regard to acting and being acted upon, with regard to sub- ject and object positions. This striking interchangeability-or, better, simultaneity-of actantial roles is carefully elaborated in the culmi- nation (both erotic and narrative) of Jean's rewritten Ovidian exem- plum: Or est Pygmalions aaise, Or n'est il riens qui li desplaise, Car riens qu'il vueille el ne refuse; S'il opose, ele se rent concluse, S'ele comande, il obeist: Pour riens ne la contredeist D'acomplir li tout son desir. [11. 21175 -81 ] At last Pygmalion is happy. There is nothing that can displease him, for she refuses nothing that he might want: if he raises objections, she re- solves them by surrendering herself; if she commands, he obeys. For nothing would he refuse to accomplish all her desires for her. [346]</page><page sequence="7">KEVIN BROWNLEE 199 Fifth, the fact that in Jean's Rose the Pygmalion and Galatea story culminates with two naked bodies interlocked in a "successful" erotic embrace is semantically overdetermined. This scene of a lover holding his beloved naked in his arms functions in important ways against a key program operative from very early on in the conjoined Rose text, a program that had repeatedly presented this image as a dream, a lie, or both, utilizing as point of departure the famous rhyme word pair songe! mensonge with which Guillaume's poem had opened. 13 Thus this program begins (from a "retrospective" point of view) in the voice of Guillaume-author, who opens his prologue (11. 1-44) with a meditation on dreams, lies, and interpretation: "Maintes genz dient que en songes / N'a se fables non e men~onges" (Many people say that there is nothing in dreams but fables and lies) (11 1-2; 31).14 The second stage occurs in the voice of Guillaume-narrator, in a passage of self- conscious commentary (11. 2060-76) situated at the approximate mid- point of the Guillaumian text considered as a "complete" work.15 The dream here being recounted is not a lie; rather, it contains a hidden senefiance (1. 2072) to be revealed after the dream-narrative is com- pleted: La verit6, qui est coverte, Vos sera lores toute aperte Quant espondre m'orroiz le songe, Car iA n'i a mot de men~onge. [11. 2073-76] The truth which is now hidden will become completely revealed to you when you have heard me explain the dream, for it does not contain a single lying word. [59] The third stage of the program involves Guillaume's authoritative Dieux d'Amors speaking to Amant about one of the particular suffer- ings that await the latter in his future life as a lover (11. 2423-504).16 Amors warns Amant about the future erotic dreams ("pensee delit- 13.

The disappointed, weeping Amant will then chastise and inter- rogate himself: "Deus, ai je songig" [God, have I been dreaming?] (1. 2449; 64). Jean de Meun continues and complicates the program by setting up what is in effect its fourth stage, as his character Raison retells the Ovidian fable of Croesus's dream and Phania's interpretation (11. 6489- 630) as a parable on the difficulties and dangers of both falsely and truth- fully glossing dreams (within the overall context of illustrating the ab- solute power of Fortune). When Phania correctly glosses her father's dream as signifying his imminent death by hanging, he rebukes her, us- ing the now semantically overdetermined rhyme word pair that had initiated the program as such: E quant par vostre fol respons M'avez mon songe ainsinc espons, Servi m'avez de granz men~onges; Car sachiez que cist nobles songes, Ou fausse glose voulez metre, Deit estre entenduz a la letre. [11. 6605-10] In your foolish response, when you explain my dream to me in this way, you have served me with great lies; for know that this noble dream, to which you want to put a false gloss, should be understood according to the letter. [128] By this point in the program, it seems that only interpretation can be qualified as truth or lie, or rather, that the truth status of a dream is a function of its interpretation or gloss. A further elaboration of the program occurs as part of the advice given by Ami to Amant (in the third person) as to how to utilize de- ception to advance the seduction of his Lady should Amant fall ill (11. 9883-94). Ami suggests that Amant pretend to be tormentedby dreams resembling the false visions of lying naked in bed with his lady, which had been earlier described by the God of Love (at the third stage of our program, 11. 2423-504). In other words, we now have a dedoublement of deceptive dream discourse within the context of the overall program: Ami counsels the mendacious recounting of dreams never actually ex- perienced, and which if experienced would have been false by defini- tion. At the center is the now doubly false image of the loving couple lying naked in each others' arms:</page><page sequence="9">KEVIN BROWNLEE 201 Si li deit feindre nouveaus songes, Touz farsiz de plaisanz men~onges: Que quant vient au seir qu'il se couche Touz seus en sa chambre en sa couche, Avis li est, quant il someille Qu'il l'ait entre ses braz tenue Trestoute nuit trestoute nue, Par soulaz e par druerie E par jour en leus delitables. Teus fables li cont ou semblables. [11. 9883-87; 9889-94] He must pretend to have unusual dreams, all stuffed with pleasing false- hoods. Let him say when night comes and he lies all alone on his bed in his room, it seems to him when he sleeps ... that all night long and through the day, in delightful places, he held her all naked in his arms in the solace of love-making. He should tell her such fables or similar ones. [176] Nature's discourse on false dreams and visions (11. 18287-514), es- pecially those of lovers (which receive the most elaborate treatment), constitutes the sixth and (up to this point in the text) longest stage of the program I am here investigating. Nature begins by characterizing the realistic hallucinations of melancholy, obsessive brooders: "E ce n'est fors trufle e menconge/ Ainsinc con de l'ome qui songe" [But what they see is only a trifling lie, just as with a man who dreams] (11. 18363-64; 305). Next, Nature undermines the authority of Scipio (mentioned by name in line 18367), thus both recalling and overturn- ing Guillaume de Lorris's initial citation of classical auctores in sup- port of his own poetics of dreams, truth, and interpretation: the Ci- ceronian Somnium Scipionis and the Commentary by Macrobius (11. 6- 10), which together constituted medieval France's single most author- itative text on dream psychology and "metaphysics." This critical evo- cation of Guillaume's prologue1 7 leads Nature to a critical presentation in miniature (11. 18383-404) of Amant's dream (that is, the Rose itself, the dream we are in the process of reading) as untrue (or, better, non- 17.

Car cil qui fins amanz se claiment, Quant d'amour ardemment s'entraiment, Don mout travauz e enuiz, Quant se sont endormi de nuiz En leur liz, ou mout ont pens6. Si songent les choses amees Que tant ont par jour reclamees. [11. 18387-88; 18395-99; 18401-02] He feels his beloved in his arms, but she is not there at all.... For those who call themselves courtly lovers, when they burn with love for each other (causing themselves great toil and trouble), and when they have gone to sleep at night in their beds, or have thought a good deal ... then they dream of the beloved things that they have asked for so much by day. [305] Nature concludes her digression on dreams by a statement of skep- tical detachment with regard to their truth value that seems to rein- 18. See J. Willis, ed., Ambrosii Theodosii Macrobii. Commentarii in Somnium Sci- pionis, 1.3.1-8 (Leipzig: Teubner, 1970), 8-10; and William Harris Stahl, Macrobius, Commentary on the Dream of Scipio (New York: Columbia University Press, 1952), 87- 90. Particularly worthy of note is Macrobius's categorization of "amator deliciis suis aut fruentem se videat aut carentem" (the lover who dreams of possessing his sweetheart or of losing her) as insomnium. This Macrobian classification is of course relevant to the program we are here investigating in the Rose, though not in a simple or univocal way. The degree to which his use of the Macrobian subtext suggests that Guillaume de Lorris, in his prologue, is implicitly presenting his own dream (whose narration is about to be- gin) as "nonprophetic" is the degree to which the courtly constraints on Guillaume-au- thor are manifest from the outset. To consider Guillaume's Roman de la Rose as being- in its entirety-a lyric offering to a privileged extratextual addressee, the Lady who should be called "Rose" (II. 40-44), is to be aware of the necessity for a modification, a nuancing, of Guillaume's surface structure claims that this dream will (or has already) come true-that it is a prophetic dream in Macrobian terms. For this claim would, as mentioned above, undermine the Rose's function as a courtly, lyric offering/request (and see Hult, Self-Fulfilling Prophecies, 174). Cf. Dahlberg, "Macrobius and the Unity of the Roman de la Rose," Studies in Philology 58 (1961): 573-82; and Fleming, The "Roman de la Rose": A Study in Allegory and Iconography (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969), esp. 54-55. I would like to thank Ben Semple for a stimulating discussion about the limitations of Macrobian dream categories for and in the Rose.</page><page sequence="11">KEVIN BROWNLEE 203 state the terms of Guillaume's initial prologue configuration as a prob- lem with no solution, or at least none in the terms of the "natural philo- sophical" (Chartrian) discourse Jean's character Nature embodies.19 Thus the extraordinary double re-citation of Guillaume's opening rhyme word pair within the space of eight lines (in an order that can be described as an inverted chiasmus) works as a formal structural marker in Nature's speech, while at the same time signaling a kind of final au- thorial distancing from any claims to a fully adequate "poetic" (or even literary) solution to the problematic relationship between dreams and truth, words and things, signs and referents-especially in the context of desire, sexual and otherwise. First, we have a "scientific" statement of universal applicability with regard to dreaming activity that serves to counteract Guillaume's "selective" discourse and mimesis (both courtly and clerkly). Then, we have a self-consciously rhetorical inter- vention by Nature, speaking "in character" (cf. the initial praeteritio of 11. 18295-97) to terminate a digression which is presented as such: Qu'il n'est nus, seit veirs soit men~onge, Qui mainte vision ne songe, Non pas treis feiz en la semaine, Mais quinze feiz en la quinzaine, Ou plus ou meins par aventure, Si con sa fantasie endure. Ne ne revueil dire des songes S'il sont veir ou s'ils sont men~onges De tout ce ne m'entremetrai, Mais a mon propos me retrai. [11. 18491-98; 18513-14] For there is no one, whether he lies or tells the truth, who does not dream many visions, not just three times a week, but fifteen times in two weeks, or perhaps more or less, according to the strength of his fan- tasy. I do not want to say any more about dreams, about whether they are true or lies.... I will not undertake all this, but will come back to my subject. [306-07] The close of Nature's digression concludes the sixth stage of what I have been considering as the Rose's programmatic linking of dreams, 19.

This program provides an important context for Jean's depiction of the erotic fulfillment of his Pygmalion and Galatea, beginning with the latter's metamorphosis. Thus the careful undoing of the songe/mensonge opposition (with re- gard to both rhyme and semantics, especially 11. 21145-47) in Pyg- malion's speech in which he expresses incredulity before the newly an- imated Galatea functions to give this scene a special, exceptional status within the conjoined Rose text as a whole. This metamorphosis is nei- ther the dream of Pygmalion, nor is it part of the dream of Amant (es- tablished as the basic frame for the narrative of Guillaume de Lorris). It is, rather, the voice of Jean de Meun as author figure reworking his Ovidian model text.20 And within this reworking, Galatea's metamor- phosis is presented as "true" by Jean's text itself, indeed by Galatea her- self, for the first words she speaks constitute the answer to Pygmalion's question: Is this a dream, is this an illusion? "Qu'est-ce?" dist il. "sui je tentez? Veille je pas? Nenin, ainz songe; Mais onc ne vi si apert songe. Songe par fei, non faz, ainz veille. Don vient donques cete merveille? Est ce fantosme ou anemis Qui s'est en mon image mis?" [11. 21144-50] "What is this?" he said. "Am I being tempted? Am I awake? No, not awake, but dreaming. But no one ever saw so lifelike a dream. Dream! In faith, I do not dream but wake. Then where does this wonder come from? Is it a phantom or demon who has been put into my image? " [345] Galatea's answer introduces her initial courtly self-identification, discussed above: "Ce n'est anemis ne fantome,/ Douz amis, ainz sui vostre amie" (It is not a demon or a phantom, sweet lover, but rather I am your lover) (11. 21154-55; 345). But to present this reworked Ovidian fable as "true" is to treat "truth" as itself a fictional construct. For Jean's Pygmalion narrative is triply marked as fiction, as poetry, and as art: (1) it derives from Ovid's fable; (2) it recounts the tale of a master artist figure; (3) it is told directly from the perspective of Jean-author, who presents himself in the act of transformatively rewriting the Ovidian text he is simultaneously read- ing. It is thus highly significant that only within this overtly fictional 20. See K. Brownlee, "Orpheus," 203 -06.</page><page sequence="13">KEVIN BROWNLEE 205 Ovidian context does Jean de Meun show language and desire to work as a single system, figured by the successful erotic embrace of the naked bodies of Pygmalion and Galatea. At the same time, this couple functions contrastively within the Rose vis-a-vis two key earlier depictions of a couple in bed together, first by Ami's character Le Jaloux (11. 8843-77); second, by Genius dur- ing his dialogue with Nature (especially 11. 16389-568). Both of these earlier treatments involve a foolish husband and his deceptive wife: their recumbent bodies in bed together at night (that is, in the conven- tional locus and configuration for erotic activity) enact sexual ineffi- cacy. The accomplishment of the sexual act is encumbered by cloth- ing, by language, or by both. Le Jaloux's wife resists his unappreciated sexual advances, by means of (and in favor of) her expensive garments. The wife figure evoked by Genius only wants to worm her husband's secrets out of him in order to gain power over him. The lovemaking scene between Pygmalion and Galatea makes these two earlier couples seem like "negative versions" that it fulfills in bono,21 but again, only by means of and in the context of Jean's fiction making,22 his overt re- fabulation of the Ovidian fabula from the Metamorphoses. When we turn to what I am positing as the second ending of the Rose (the pilgrim's staff sequence), sexual consummation is represented in qualitatively different terms: the actants are no longer human bodies but concretized metaphors. The process begins with the elaborate metaphorization of the male genitalia at the opening of the, sequence: Je ... comme bons pelerins ... come fins amoureus vers l'archiere acueil mon veiage, pour fournir mon pelerinage; E port o mei, par grant effort, Escharpe e bourdon reide e fort, Tel qu'il n'a mestier de ferrer Pour journeier ne pour errer. L'escharpe est de bone faiture, 21. Cf. also, the Venus and Mars narrative (based on Ovid's Ars amatoria 2.561-92) recounted within the speeches of Jean's characters La Vieille (11. 13840-71; 14159ff.) and Nature (II. 18061-129).

Nature, qui la me bailla Des lors que primes la tailla, Soutilment forgiez i avait. [11. 21346-47; 21349; 21351-56; 21363; 21365] I set out like a good pilgrim, like a courtly lover, on the journey toward the aperture, the goal of my pilgrimage. And I carried with me, by great effort, the sack and the staff so stiff and strong that it didn't need to be shod with iron for traveling and wandering. The sack was well made, of a supple skin without seam. You should know that it was not empty: Nature who gave it to me had subtly forged two hammers with great care at the same time as she first designed it. [348] The mimesis of the sexual act that follows involves a mechanical working out of this metaphoric system to represent a dehumanized, "genital specific" or "genital exclusive" coupling. On the one hand, then, we find a sexual mimesis that privileges figurative language as such, and a mechanical process of metaphor; on the other, a reductive sexual mimesis that distorts the human body by figuring it through a single, radical metonymy, in which the part displaces the whole: De l'image lors m'apressai Que dou saintuaire pres sai; Mout la baisai devotement, E, pour estuier sauvement, Vos mon bourdon metre en l'archiere, Ou l'escharpe pendait darriere. Bien l'i cuidai lancier de bout, Mais li resort, e jou rebout, Mais riens ne vaut, toujourz recule. Tant ai hurte que touteveie M'apercui d'une estreire veie, Par ou bien cuit outre passer; Mais le paliz m'estuet casser. Par la sentele que j'ai dite, Qui tant iert estreite e petite, Par ou le passage quis ai, Le paliz au bourdon brisai: Sui mei dedenz l'archiere mis.</page><page sequence="15">KEVIN BROWNLEE 207 Mais pour riens nule ne laissasse Que le bourdon tout n'i passasse: Outre l'ai passe senz demeure; Mais l'escharpe dehors demeure, o les martelez rebillanz, Qui dehors ierent pendillanz. [11. 21601-09, 21633-41, 21645-50] I approached the image in order to be closer to the sanctuary. I kissed the image very devoutly and then, to enter the sheath safely, I wanted to put my staff into the aperture, with the sack hanging behind. Indeed I thought I could shoot it in at the first try, but it came back out. I re- placed it, but to no avail; it still recoiled.... Nevertheless, I attacked so much that I discovered a narrow passage by which I thought I might pass beyond, but to do so I had to break the paling. By this path, narrow and small, where I sought passage, I broke down the paling with my staff and gained a place in the aperture.... But I would have relaxed for noth- ing until the entire staff had entered, so I pressed it through with no de- lay. But the sack, with its pounding hammers, remained hanging out- side. [351-52] In contrast to the union of the lovers' two bodies in the Pygmalion story, here we end with the union of two sets of detached, depersonal- ized genitalia, figured metaphorically.23 At the same time, the actantial reciprocity of Pygmalion's and Galatea's mutual desire is displaced by a rigorous actantial hierarchy of dominance and submission. Here, the positions of acting subject and passive object are mutually exclusive; they exist, as it were, in com- plementary distribution: they cannot coexist simultaneously in the same autonomous self as they had been shown to do in the Pygmalion/ Galatea fable. In the extended sexual metaphor of the bourdon (staff) penetrating the archiere (aperture), the desiring subject is exclusively masculine; the object of desire, exclusively feminine. And reciprocally, masculine sexuality is exclusively active; female sexuality, exclusively passive. The actantial relationship here is unidirectional, within the economy of desire. Thus, again in contradistinction to the erotic reciprocity that had 23. A key starting point for this metaphoric mimesis of sexual union in Jean's text is, of course, the earlier debate on metaphoric discourse and linguistic referentiality be- tween Raison and Amant (II. 6943 -7204; esp. 7109-21). See Note 10 above, esp. Poirion, "Les mots et les choses," and Hult, Self-Fulfilling Prophecies, 116-19. See also Fleming, Reason and the Lover (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984), 106, and Kay, "Venus," and Rose, 70.</page><page sequence="16">208 Yale French Studies characterized Pygmalion and Galatea, here we have a sexual desire that is entirely masculinized. The female role is limited to that of recipient of male sexual desire. Indeed, this representation of passive female sexuality emerges as a projection of male desire, simultaneously fetishized into a single, detached, passive body part: the vagina as sta- tic receptacle. Linked to this stasis is the necessary silence of the female figure. Unlike the fully humanized and eroticized Galatea, Jean's use of a rei- fied aperture, passage, and sanctuaire to represent female sexual iden- tity here precludes the possibility of female speech. This mimetic sys- tem necessarily silences the female agent, whose very possibility seems to be denied in "ideological" terms. And there is, of course, a necessary corollary in terms of linguistic practice. Again, in contradistinction to the special case of Pygmalion and Galatea, the language of desire in the bourdon/archiere sequence does not involve effective communication between a man and a woman. Rather, this kind of communication is excluded by definition from the mimetic system here employed by Jean. The language of de- sire is exclusively masculinized: a male lover recounts his sexual con- quest to a male audience (the "seigneur vallet" [young lords] of line 21678). I would like to suggest that the symmetrically opposed representa- tion of sexual consummation contained in Pygmalion/Galatea on the one hand and the escharpe/archiere sequence on the other are meant to be read against each other "dialectically." Neither is sufficient, nei- ther is definitive. Rather, the two contrasting versions are intended to comment on each other. The textual authorization for this kind of di- alectical reading is to be found in what I consider to be a set of instruc- tions to the reader of Jean's Rose that itself forms part of the conclusion to the poem:24 Ainsinc va des contraires choses: Les une sont des autres gloses; E qui l'une en veaut defenir, De I'autre 1i deit souvenir. Ou ja, par nule entencion, 24. See Nancy Freeman Regalado, "'Des contraires choses': la fonction poetique de la citation et des exempla dans le Roman de la Rose," Litterature 41 (1981): 62-81. Cf. Poirion's insightful remark: "The meaning of the poem will thus only reveal itself through the analysis of these discourses, of their specific logic and of their dialectic in the context of the work as a whole" (Le roman de la Rose, 131).</page><page sequence="17">KEVIN BROWNLEE 209 N'i metra diffinicion; Car qui des deus n'a quenoissance Ja n'i quenoistra diference, Senz quei ne puet venir en place Diffinicion que l'en face. [11. 21573-82] Thus things go by contraries; one is the gloss of the other. If one wants to define one of the pair, he must remember the other, or he will never, by any intention, assign a definition to it; for he who has no under- standing of the two will never understand the difference between them, and without this difference no definition that one may make can come to anything. [351] Neither of these opposed mimeses of erotic fulfillment is sufficient, complete, or definitive. A dialectical reading of the two is necessary. And Jean's conjoined Rose text emerges above all as the verbal and hermeneutic structure that contains contrary, opposed systems of rep- resentational and linguistic practice, tied to correspondingly opposed axiological systems. This becomes fully clear, I think, when the third and final version of the narrative and erotic closure of the conjoined Rose text is effected in the poem's concluding lines: Ainz que d'ileuc me remuasse, Ou, mon vueil, encor demourasse, Par grant joliete coilli La fleur dou bel rosier foilli. Ainsinc oi la rose vermeille. Atant fu jourz, e je m'esveille. [11. 21775-780] Before I moved from that place, where I wish I could still have remained, I plucked, with great delight, the flower from the leaves of the rosebush, and thus I have my red rose. Straightaway it was day, and I awoke. [354] The hybrid mimesis of Guillaume de Lorris is reintroduced but as ecriture au second degre, as rewriting, as visible fictional construct. The anthropomorphic male Lover and the floral metaphor for the Lady (simultaneously a courtly metonymy for her sex) are thus equally fic- tional at the close: equally constructed. And the same is of course true for the final evocation of Guillaume's dream frame, now nothing more than a literary convention, but valorized as such. Particularly significant in this context is the fact that the final end- ing to Jean's Rose is simultaneously a re-citation and a "fulfillment" of the key passage from the God of Love's midpoint speech, a passage that</page><page sequence="18">210 Yale French Studies had "pre-determined" the poem's closing signal with regard to narra- tive structure. Jean's conjoined Rose text inscribes the sign of its own closure by means of a "proleptic citation" contained within this speech when, at the level of plot, Amours "prophesies" the birth of Jean de Meun, au- thor of the text we are in the process of reading, at a moment that is diegetically anterior to the inception of Jean's text presented as plot event. We are told that Jean will begin his continuation more than forty years after the death of Guillaume, who is designated as the conjoined poem's "first" author while remaining its "sole" protagonist. In this way, Jean's relation to the first-person subject matter of the work (that is, love) is presented exclusively as that of an author to this text. With regard to the projected end point of the plot, Jean's writerly enterprise is presented as the transcription of a set of narrative events whose final element is known in advance. His transcription will thus continue Jusqu'a tant qu'il avra coillie Seur la branche vert e foillie La tres bel rose vermeille, E qu'il seit jourz e qu'il s'esveille. [10599-602] up to the time when he will have cut the most beautiful rose on its green, leafy branch, to the time when it is day and he awakes. [188] Formally, the final words of Jean's conjoined Rose text (11. 21777-80) reproduce the striking double rhyme word pair of this model passage. Grammatically, Jean's final four lines rewrite in the first-person past and present what the model passage had scripted in the third-person fu- ture and future perfect.25 By way of my own conclusion, I would like to summarize. The dialec- tical juxtaposition of the three endings of the Rose (a readerly process required, it seems, by the hermeneutic ground rules of Jean's text) con- stitutes in the last analysis an extended authorial meditation on the pro- cesses and the problems, the possible successes and the built in limi- tations of mimetic art as such: of verbal signifying activity and its capacities for transmitting values. With the Pygmalion and Galatea story, Jean utilizes a fully anthro- 25. See Dragonetti, "Pygmalion," 96; and K.

At issue is a fable, a representation of the signifying power of ART, told "successfully" on Art's own terms as defined by Jean's Rose. These terms are fundamen- tally Ovidian, a status that suggests both power and limitations: on the one hand, beauty, and "efficacy" (the only fully "successful" depiction of fulfilled erotic desire and language in the Rose), and on the other, an inescapable fictionality. In the escharpe/archiere sequence, Jean utilizes a fully metaphoric (or figurative) mimesis and a poetics clearly derived from the character Genius: what might be called a modified Chartrian poetics. At issue is a fable that represents the signifying power of NATURE, told success- fully in Nature's own terms, defined by Jean's Rose as entailing built- in limitations with regard to desire, language, and human activity. In the Taking of the Rose sequence, Jean utilizes the hybrid mime- sis of Guillaume de Lorris, refiguring the male desiring subject anthro- pomorphically and the female object of desire metaphorically. At issue here is the signifying power of the conjoined ROSE text as conceived and effected by Jean de Meun as global author figure. The poetics are also hybrid, or, rather, double: the initial poetics of Guillaume are here recast by Jean as a fiction "contained" by the global textual structure he has erected on Guillaume's (now superseded) foundation.</page></plain_text>
