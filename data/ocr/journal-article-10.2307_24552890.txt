<plain_text><page sequence="1">GAUDIER-BRZESKA'S NUDES by Francine A. Koslow Eight nude female torsos grace a letter that Henri Gaudier-Brzeska sent to his compan ion Sophie Brzeska in November 1912. The gifted draftsman used these drawings of the torso of a beautiful nude to pictorialize his experience at South Kensington's Albert Hall, listening with his eyes closed to Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. He drew a frontal nude torso with curved breasts fol lowed by variously shaded and shaped frontal and side views (fig. 1) with the same ink that he used to write the following words describ ing the cadences of Beethoven's Symphony: dj * W I I I can't describe the Symphony to you, but the whole has a suave amplitude, and gives the impression of a very beautiful young woman's torso, firm but soft, seen at first by rarefied lights, and then with strong light and shade something like this, but with sounds instead of tones.1 Like his hero Michelangelo, Gaudier regarded the nude human figure as the basic unit of artistic expression. From the outset of his brief but prolific career as a draftsman in 1909, Gaudier employed the nude as a vehi cle to express his ideas about beauty, form, and design. Together as a body of work, Gaudier's nudes comprise over a third of his artistic production and are valuable indica tors of his artistic development from natural ism to highly stylized geometric abstraction. Gaudier, a noted sculptor and draftsman, was never formally trained. He taught him self after the masters in museums and in books and by 1912 spent two evenings per week in life-drawing class. He worked rapidly on paper in a variety of media, taking his inspiration from other art, from the model, from memory, or from his artistic imagina tion. His nudes—designed with equal skill in pencil, crayon, pen and ink, charcoal, pastel, wash, and Chinese ink—capture the essence of the human body. They run the gamut from conservatively drawn early works, con scientious to the point of being bound to the model, to wildly erotic caricatures and mature abstractions suggesting the body through geometric configurations. All are drawn with the consummate skill of a devel oping master. Gaudier-Brzeska's earliest nudes were studies made in 1909 after Michelangelo and the Elgin marbles, during his first trip to England. Living on a two-year scholarship to study commerce in Bristol, Gaudier found himself more caught up with the art in Brit ish museums than with commerce. He cap tured his early impressions of the great works</page><page sequence="2">in the British Museum on several pages of a small sketchbook (22.5x14cm) he carried with him. Page eight of Gaudier's early sketchbook contains a pencil anatomical study of a male nude inscribed "from Michel angelo" (fig. 2). Gaudier's awkward and mannered drawing appears to be a study after Michelangelo's drawing Christ Risen (fig. 3, c. 1531) in the collection of the British Museum and cannot compare with the Ren aissance master's anatomical precision. However, Gaudier's doughy rendition does combine a spirited feel for energy with a gen uinely sculptural understanding of form. Gaudier here concentrates on his figure's powerful muscles, exaggerating and drama tizing for expressive purposes the individual shapes. The lively and expressive torso of Gaudier's overly muscular Christ is the work of an untrained artist who had not yet drawn directly from the nude model. A pencil study of the river god Ilissos from the West pediment of the Parthenon graces page 22 of the same sketchbook (fig. 4). That Michelangelo and Phidias were Gaudier's first yardsticks for perfection, that he made the British Museum his Academy are vital to understanding his artistic development. Although comparison between Gaudier's careful pencil drawing and the actual pente lic marble River God Ilissos in the British Museum (fig. 5, c. 435 B.C.) underlines Gaudier's early awkwardness with anatomy and lack of formal training, this early nude torso study after sculpture shows great prom ise. Here the artist captures the main con tours of the reposing torso with a few careful pencil lines and creates an interesting pattern of curved lines. Indeed the 18-year-old Gaudier had an innate understanding of sculptural form and was able to create a sense of solidity and volume in his Ilissos drawing. By 1911, Gaudier's analysis of the human body was more systematic. In a letter dated April 23, 1911, the artist described how he methodically built a statuesque image of a human body from a series of geometric ele ments, joined with a thin line: I went on with the study of form and the arrangement of Michelangelo's noted planes. . . . when I draw The Slaves.. . . for a long time I look at the thing I want to understand, and then draw by system.. . .1 draw square boxes, adjusting the sizes, one for each plane, and then suddenly by joining the boxes with a few little lines, they see the statue emerge.2 Gaudier decided by late 1912 to attend life drawing classes twice a week. This radically changed his method of approaching the human form. He first documents his visits to life-drawing class in a letter written to Sophie Brzeska, November 5, 1912: This evening I am going to the life class, and I shall enjoy it.3 A fine group of charcoal and crayon figure drawings indicates Gaudier's enthusiasm for working from life. Stooping Male Nude (fig. 6, 1912) is a skillful example of Gaudier's sensi tivity to the human body.

The drawing is one of a series of heavy black-ink wash drawings of the female nude, dominated by curved planes and highly styl ized primitivizing features. Although Gaudier has made no attempt at modeling, the contour lines and broad planes make the weight and muscular substance of Squatting Female Nude instantly apparent. With the greatest economy of means, he creates a strong sense of rhythm in this small figure. The curve of her breasts are repeated in the arcs of her buttocks. This is a mature study Fig 12 of the female figure, created through the arrangement of curves and broad lines. It was probably not made from life, but in the studio, where a more conceptualized and highly abstract figure could be created through memory. Gaudier's best-known artistic style is dis tinctly linked with a primitivizing form of international Futurism. His developing interest in the organization of basic geomet ric shapes led to a reduction of his nude fig ure's features to triangles and ovals, as in a futuristic study for the sculpture Red Stone Dancer (fig. 13, c. 1913-14). The artist's short hand convention of placing a simplified tri angle within an ovoid shape bears witness to his adoption by late 1913 of the clean-cut geometry of Vorticism. In this multi-limbed, three-headed figure study for the Vorticist masterpiece Red Stone Dancer (fig. 14, 1914), Gaudier shows the various phases of the dance in a Futurist manner. The numerous overlapping and interweaving arches give this brush and India-ink figure its strong rhythmic character. Three different views of the head (an inverted isosceles triangle within an elliptical cone), three different arms, and an ambiguous number of pairs of legs are positioned on a single stationary torso. The complex posturing of heads and appendages gives an unmistakable impres Fig. 13 sion of mobility and indicates an ongoing interest on the part of the artist in the simul taneous stages of movement. This work is sexually suggestive, indicating motion through the penetration of semielliptical planes at the genital area. Since his early days admiring Rodin, Gaudier had been interested in the expression of movement in art. Study for Red Stone Dancer orchestrates the sensation of motion with semimechanical, semiabstract organic imagery. However far Gaudier removed himself from direct study of the human anatomy, his nudes are always anthropomorphic, and the human figure clearly dominates his work. Gaudier's graphic personality, as revealed in a sampling of his nude studies from 1908 to 1914, is touched with a love for the human body in all its variety. Combining shorthand notation of studies of figures in motion with elegantly controlled geometric form, Gaudier captured the main impulses of early 20th-century modernism in his nudes. In an atmosphere of intense experimentation, Gaudier rapidly developed from a self-con scious, derivative, realist manner to a uniquely personal, primitive, geometric Fig. 14 style. His abounding energy for movement, 86 Fig. 12 Fig. 13 Fig. 14 sculptural form, and rhythm appear in all his drawings. Some reveal the sculptor's first efforts at envisaging a new form, as in Study for Red Stone Dancer, while others, like Female Nude Bending, are complete drawings made for their own sake. Gaudier-Brzeska's remarkable vision for the absolute and essen tial lines of form reveal themselves most sen sitively in his nudes. His prolific production, which tends to make up for his short life, was fed by his experimental nature. In a loving letter to his younger sister Renée, written in 1911, Gaudier instructed her in his own rules for drawing: Don't be frightened, make mistakes, as many as you like, but all the time draw very very strongly.10 ■Henri Gaudier-Brzeska to Sophie Brzeska, November 3, 1912, in H.
