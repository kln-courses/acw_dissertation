With  regard to the theoretical (dharmaśāstra) foundations of the use of such verses, only the Viṣṇusmr̥ti is  cited, but the much fuller discussion, using this text as well as others, is given in a publication of Julius  Jolly that is not referred to. 14 The title of Willis’s monograph promises a treatment of comprehensive scope but the work is actu- ally limited to a particular period in the history of Hindu ritual, and there too the arguments are so often  tendentious that it is impossible for us to join the majority of previous reviewers in their generally very  positive reception of this book. 15 Nevertheless, especially when read under the moderating influence of  Virkus’s work and along with other publications mentioned above, The Archaeology of Hindu Ritual  may certainly be recommended as a rich introduction to the study of the Gupta age.

Tamil Love Poetry: The Five Hundred Short Poems of the Aiṅkurunūru. By Martha ann selBy.  Translations from the Asian Classics. New York: coluMBia university Press, 2011. Pp. 195 +  xii. $84.50 cloth; $27.50 (paper). In this beautiful book, acclaimed translator Martha Ann Selby provides us with a complete, updated  translation of the Aiṅkurunūru, a classical Tamil anthology of love poetry. This anthology is one of  the earliest five of the eight anthologies of poetry that constitute the first literature in Tamil, dating  between the first and third centuries c.e. The Aiṅkurunūru is longer than the other early classical  collections of Tamil poetry, which contain 400 poems apiece, including the three collections of love  poems entitled the Kuruntokai, the Narriṇai, and the Akanānūru, as well as the collection of poems  of war, the Puraṇānūru. It is also set apart from these anthologies by the small number of poets who  contributed to the anthology—only five, as compared to 150–200 poets each for the other collections.  Selby argues convincingly for the special coherence of the Aiṅkurunūru: “We know from the colophon  that the text was a Cēra imperial commission and its compiler was Pula-t-turai Murriya Kūṭalur Kilār.  The Aiṅkurunūru is, in fact, not an ‘anthology’ in the same way in which its sister anthologies are.  The structure of the text as a whole is deliberate, and it is clear from the way in which it is assembled  that its commissioner had a specific plan in mind, and that the compiler carried out the commissioner’s  orders to the letter. . . . I would argue that these five brilliant [poets] formed a short-lived atelier” (p. 4).  A marker of the text’s distinctiveness and coherence is that it reorders the sequencing of landscapes  and matching lovers’ moods that are a central element of classical Tamil poetry. The early Tamil  grammar, the Tolkāppiyam, describes the order as kuriñci (usually a clandestine meeting of the lov- ers at night in the mountains), neytal (usually the lovers’ separation and suggestion of abandonment,  indexed by the seashore), pālai (usually the hero traveling across a wilderness to elope with or marry  the heroine), mullai (usually married heroine waiting for her husband’s return from a journey in the  evening), and marutam (usually jealous quarrelling between husband and wife related to his perceived  infidelities). The Aiṅkurunūru devotes one hundred poems to each of these themes, in ten sets of ten on  a specific theme. However, the Aiṅkurunūru begins its collection with jealous quarrelling (marutam),  followed by neytal, kuriñci, and pālai, before concluding “with one hundred poems devoted to the  </page> <page sequence="2"> 144 Journal of the American Oriental Society 134.1 (2014) theme of domestic happiness and patient separation after marriage, Pēyanār’s mullai poems,” perhaps  due to the patron’s and compiler’s desire to end the anthology “on an auspicious note” (p. 13).  The commissioner was king Yānai-k-kaṭ Cēy Māntaraṇ Cēral Irumporai of the Cēra dynasty in what  is now the Kerala state of India; this king was the subject of both a praise poem and an elegy written  by the compiler of the Aiṅkurunūru on the occasion of the king’s death in the Puranānūru collection  of poems of war (pp. 3, 21 n. 13). In her brief review of scholarship on Tamil literature and epigraphy,  Selby concurs on an early date for the Aiṅkurunūru, with the second century c.e. most likely (pp. 3–4). We learn about the nature of the text, as well as Selby’s thoughts on translation, in her brief review  of past translations of the Aiṅkurunūru, including a 1984 complete translation of the text by P. Jot- timuttu as well as twenty-five verses by G. Hart (1979) and fifty-seven by A. K. Ramanujan (1985).  “Because of their brevity, the majority of these poems are constructed around an empty center of  obliquity, and, taken in tandem with the skills of educated readers, this is how their emotional effects  are successfully conveyed. The poets had to rely, therefore, mostly on their skills as imagists and not  as narrativists to bring their intentions to full life” (p. 5). While noting Jottimuttu’s linguistic abil- ity, Selby counters that the priorities of a translator are less concerned with “the conveyance of basic  information than with issues of readability, aesthetic quality, and so forth” (p. 5). Hart and Ramanujan  are both masters of translating Tamil classical poetry into English, and Selby describes her efforts as  an attempt “to mediate between” their “quite different registers”; she characterizes Hart’s translations  as “accurate, fairly literal, and never shy[ing] away from the complexities of Tamil syntax,” whereas  Ramanujan’s are “exquisite” but not particularly accurate, since he “took shortcuts—sometimes leav- ing out entire clauses that I would wager he found clumsy—in order to impose his own minimalist  aesthetic on them” (p. 5). Here is a side-by-side look at translations of a single verse, Aiṅkurunūru 24,  by Hart, Ramanujan, and Selby: Spotted crabs whose mothers die bearing them and crocodiles that eat their young live in his town. Has he come now? Why does he embrace women so their gold bangles jingle, use up their loveliness, and leave? (George L. Hart, Poets of the Tamil Anthologies: Ancient Poems of Love and War, Princeton:  Princeton Univ. Press, 1979, p. 19) What She Said In his country spotted crabs born in their mother’s death grow up with crocodiles that devour their young. Why is he here now? And why does he  take those women,  a jangle of gold bangles  as they make love only to leave them? (A. K. Ramanujan, Poems of Love and War: From the Eight Anthologies and the Ten Long  Poems of Classical Tamil, New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1985, p. 89) </page> <page sequence="3"> Reviews of Books 145 In his place, speckled crabs kill their mothers at birth, and crocodiles gorge on their young. Has he become like them, I wonder? After embracing women as their golden bracelets jingle and having their beauty, why is it that he leaves them, Mother? (Selby, Tamil Love Poetry, pp. 30–31) This poem is in the marutam register, and authored by Ōrampōkiyār. While the translations overlap  in the meaning they convey, Selby has brought together all of the most evocative elements gracefully,  especially in her gesture to enhance the poet’s implied simile with the question, “Has he become like  them, I wonder?” Selby’s translation is also distinctive in placing this verse in context in several ways.  Although Hart and Ramanujan generally choose to translate and present verses from the Aiṅkurunūru  individually, each verse belongs to a group of ten on a certain theme; Selby translates all ten of the set.  She also makes explicit the theme, by translating the specific Tamil word or phrase that is used in each  verse of the set, linking them all; in the example above, the crab (kaḷavan-pattu) is the common ele- ment. She also provides an introductory discussion based on Tamil commentaries for each set, locating  the verses in relation to each other, which is more extensive than Ramanujan’s “what she said” nota- tion; for the example above, Selby clarifies that the words are spoken by the girlfriend to the heroine in  earshot of the hero, who is ignoring his newborn son (p. 30). However, placing the poems in their original sets raises an issue that is puzzling but not addressed in  Selby’s discussion: Why are there chronological jumps within a set? For example, in the set of poems  21–30, from which the example above was chosen, the first seven poems are set in the postmarital con- text, but the final three are set in the context of clandestine love before marriage (pp. 29–30). This kind  of atemporal switching of register occurs in many sets. What is one to make of such a shift? If anyone  is planning to use this book in the classroom it is a question that is bound to be raised, and I wish the  translator had at least addressed, if not theorized, it. Instead of dealing with these and other critical yet undertheorized issues that are likely be raised  by readers and to come up in the classroom (e.g., Why is the major locus of attention in this poetry the  heartbreak of a young woman? What are some ways to understand or imagine the social significance  of the patronage and production of this text?), Selby turns to an innovative but at first glance rather  obscure discussion of the difference between anthropomorphism and zoomorphism (pp. 13–20). Yet  ultimately, her insight that the Aiṅkurunūru’s elaborate attention to flora and fauna serves to “forge  new and illuminating identities expressing love in all its hues” (p. 20) itself bears fruit in enabling us  to understand such comparisons as evoking states of being rather than simple characteristics, as in the  following poem (Aiṅkurunūru 295, kuriñci, p. 120) and the translator’s interpretation: My heart, which left with that man of the hills  where a peacock seeks shelter  from the firebrands of hill men,  zigzags like women playing ball  and tramples the sparrow nesting in the stubble: Will it come back, I wonder? Or, finding it suitable, will it stay on in that place, never to return. “Poem 295 is the lonely soliloquy of the heroine, who suspects that he has left because he is worried  about gossip. In the second stanza, the darting peacock is the hero, the hill men bearing firebrands are  </page> <page sequence="4"> 146 Journal of the American Oriental Society 134.1 (2014) the gossipers, and she refers to herself as the trampled sparrow” (p. 119). At first it is laborious to keep  flipping the pages back and forth to match the commentary to each verse, but as one reads more deeply,  the way of seeing that Selby’s translation and discussion unlock is fluid and captivating.

Edited by catherine cléMentin-oJha. Études théma- tiques. vol. 25. Paris: école française d’extrêMe-orient, 2011, Pp. 228. €40.  This volume offers an interesting set of essays on a variety of thinkers who have used religious  ideas and practices to address social issues of their day. The book consists of seven chapters plus an  introduction, all but one of which are in French. There are helpful summaries of each contribution in  both French and English at the back of the book, making it possible for readers of either language to  get a sense of its contents. Each of the chapters focuses on the life, thought, and career of a specific  South Asian thinker, three of whom are Muslim, three of whom are Hindu, and one of whom is Jain.  Five of the seven chapters deal with individuals active during the colonial and early nationalist periods;  the final two chapters bring the volume into the present. The essays are grouped according to the religious identity of the individuals under study, with each  section being further structured along historical lines. The first three chapters deal, respectively, with  the Muslim thinkers Zaka Ullah, Iqbal, and Maududi and span the period of 1850 to 1999. The next  three deal with Hindu thinkers active between 1875 and the present. The final chapter is a study of  the Jain missionary Gurudev Shri Chitrabhanu and his contemporary community of followers. Despite  the book’s organization around religious identity, the editor seeks to avoid a deterministic view of  religion’s role in modern South Asian social and political activism. In the volume’s introduction,   Clémentin-Ojha argues that, while classifying a social movement as “religious” highlights its refer- ences to timeless beliefs and practices, the volume’s biographical approach situates each thinker in his  context. This emphasizes the role of historical contingency and individual agency in articulating a link  between religious ideas and social realities. It also highlights the inherent susceptibility of religious  traditions to a variety of possible interpretations.  Indeed, one of the volume’s main strengths is the way in which it reveals important intellectual and  pragmatic differences between the individual thinkers considered. This is true despite the fact that many  were working under similar circumstances, came from similar economic backgrounds, and often drew  upon the same belief systems to articulate their ideas. Yet while this biographical approach emphasizes  diversity of opinion, one of the book’s stated goals is to search for common features that traverse the  authors’ different subjects. Some of the broader themes raised in the various essays include the politi- cization of South Asia’s religious diversity, the linkage of individual morality to a healthy body politic,  the impact of British religiosity on South Asian social activism, and the reframing of religious renun- ciation as a form of social engagement in the modern period. While many of these themes have been  taken up in other, more narrowly focused studies, this volume enables the simultaneous consideration  of them in three different communities and traditions.  The section on Muslim thinkers begins with Margit Pernau’s English essay on Zaka Ullah. Pernau  argues that this Persian scholar, educated in Delhi College in the 1840s and therefore influenced by  British educational reforms, differs from other Muslim thinkers of the period in his efforts to demon- strate the universality of ethical teachings common to all religions. Pernau provides an illuminating  overview of Zaka Ullah’s three-volume study of Islam, Christianity, and Hinduism and its creative  translations of terminology across the three traditions.
