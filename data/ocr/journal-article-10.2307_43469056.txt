<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mark Twains Credo A Humorist's Fatalistic View PAUL F. BOLLER, JR. in 1902, Joseph Twichell lent Mark Twain a copy of Jonathan Edwards's Freedom of the Will. Twain read it straight through and then told Twichell he felt as if he had been on a three-day tear with a drunken lunatic. In Edwards, however, Twain thought he found confirmation for his own long-held views on man's subjection to necessity. "Jonathan," he wrote Twichell, seems to hold . . . that the man (or his soul or his will) never creates an im- pulse itself, but is moved to action by an impulse back of it. That's sound! Also, that of two or more things offered it, it infallibly chooses the one which for the moment is most pleasing to Itself. Perfectly correa! An immense admission for a man not otherwise sane. But Twain was not entirely pleased with Edwards. He was irked by Edwards's reconciliation of determinism with moral accountability. It was "frank insanity," Twain fumed, to make man responsible to God for his thoughts, words, and deeds, as Edwards did. Edwards's trouble was that he emphasized interior motives and overlooked the importance of ex- terior forces in shaping man's will. For this reason he failed to realize that "a man's mind is a mere machine - an automatic machine - which is handled entirely from the outside , the man himself furnishing it abso- lutely nothing." Edwards "shirked," Twain concluded, in refusing to carry his determinism to its logical conclusion and acknowledge the "irresponsi- bility of man to God." But Twain shirked too. "I wish I could learn to remember that it is unjust and dishonorable to put blame on the human race for any of its acts," he wrote Twichell in November, 1904. "For it did not make itself, it did not make its nature, it is merely a machine." The letter was, none- theless, filled with indignation and disgust over political corruption. No 150 spring 1978</page><page sequence="2">more than Edwards was Twain able to refrain from preaching to people, even though the rigorous determinism he espoused made human be- havior practically a reflex act. Twain was fascinated by the free-will question, and for years he discussed it with such friends as Twichell and William Dean Howells. He did not, to be sure, devote major energies to questions of freedom and fate. He was a humorist, satirist, social critic, and literary artist, not a philosopher or theologian, and his forays into the field of metaphysical speculation were sporadic and unsystematic. Still, he had a lifelong fascination with instances of luck, coincidence, accident, and turning- points in his own and other people's lives, and in his writings he returned time and again to the themes of chance and destiny. And in his last dark years the question of freedom and determinism became a major pre- occupation - one might almost say obsession - of his literary and intel- lectual life. It used to be said that only a German philosopher was capable of thinking that the web of things was so tightly knit that the sneeze of a peasant in medieval Europe somehow affected the fate of Germany in the nineteenth century. But Twain came to believe exactly that. "Each event has its own place in the eternal chain of circumstances," he an- nounced toward the end of his life, "and whether it be big or little it will infallibly cause the next event, whether the next event be the breaking of a child's toy or the destruction of a throne." This way of looking at things meant that the present was co-implicated in the primal past. As Twain told his friend and biographer Albert Bigelow Paine: When the first living atom found itself afloat in the great Laurentian sea the first act of that first atom led to the second act of that first atom, and so on down through the succeeding ages of all life, until, if the steps could be traced, it could be shown that the first act of that first atom has led inevitably to the act of my standing here in my dressing gown at this instant talking to you. Twain's deterministic philosophy was shaped by both scientific and religious imperatives. He was tremendously impressed by the vast im- personal universe which modern science, especially astronomy, revealed. He was also struck by the implacability of the causal sequence in nature which he thought undergirded all scientific thinking in his day. Like most of his contemporaries, he thought of laws of nature as prescriptions, not southwest Review 151</page><page sequence="3">descriptions, and he was entirely unaware of the new statistical view of scientific laws (as approximate rather than absolute regularities, operat- ing with a high degree of probability, not invariantly) which was be- ginning to replace the old absolutist view during his lifetime. But Twain's philosophy was formed by religion as well as by science. His father was a freethinker; but his mother was a Presbyterian "of that cleancut strenu- ous kind," according to Albert Paine, who regarded hell and Satan as "necessary institutions." While there is no reason to believe that Twain was ever a devout believer like his mother, it is clear that the Calvinism he imbibed as a boy in the fundamentalistic atmosphere of Hannibal, Missouri, had lasting effects on his thinking. The "religious folly you are born in you die in," Twain once lamented to William Dean Howells. His Calvinist conscience (he came to call it the Moral Sense and to heap it with obloquy) was a lifelong torment to him. He was continually re- proaching himself for unworthy conduct and then scolding himself for being so guilt-ridden about it. He came to feel as Huck Finn did about it: "If I had a yaller dog that didn't know any more than a person's con- science does I would pisen him." Or like the Connecticut Yankee: "I have noticed my conscience for many years, and I know it is more trouble and bother to me than anything else I started with." "Now tell me," Twain exclaims in one story, "why is it that a conscience can't haul a man over the coals once, for an offense, and then let him alone?" And his conscience explains: "It is my business - and my joy - to make you repent of everyt hing you do." Twain never succeeded, except in his art, in destroying what he called his "trained Presbyterian conscience." Conscience, he decided, was "the creature of training" ; it was "whatever one's mother and Bible and com- rades and laws and systems of government and habitat and heredities have made it," and it was inexpungeable. But the deterministic philosophy which he worked out in his mature years probably helped lighten the unconscionable burden of guilt, remorse, and self-doubt that he always carried around with him. If, Twain reasoned, whatever happens is simply one link in an unbroken sequence of mechanical causes and effects, one can scarcely hold himself accountable when things go wrong. At least so Twain kept telling himself. But if determinism satisfied deep-seated needs in Twain's emotional life, it also accorded with what he believed to be true about the universe. Modern science, Twain was convinced, por- trayed the world as a gigantic, impersonal, tightly knit network of causes 152 spring 1978</page><page sequence="4">and effects in which human beings played a wholly insignificant role. This meant that his "Gospel" (as he called his deterministic philosophy) was thoroughly modern, up-to-date, hard-boiled, and scientific. During the course of his ruminations about necessity, Twain singled out three major causal factors shaping human behavior: training, tem- perament, and circumstances. He regarded the first as crucial. In A Con- necticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court ( 1889), he examined the effects of "stupid misteachings" on people living in Merrie England in the sixth century. "Training - training in everything," Hank Morgan, the Yankee from Connecticut, concludes resignedly after observing for some time the absurd and often lunatic behavior of King Arthur and his people: ". . . training is all there is to a person. We speak of nature; it is folly; there is no such thing as nature; what we call by that misleading name is merely heredity and training. We have no thoughts of our own, no opinions of our own; they are transmitted to us, trained into us." The power of training in shaping human behavior also forms the basis for the irony in Pudd'nhead Wilson (1894). After the slave girl Roxanna, who is only one-sixteenth black, secretly exchanges her baby (thirty-one parts white) for her master's baby, the role of the Driscoll heir Tom, is indulged and petted (especially by Roxanna) and grows up to be an arrogant and cruel representative of the master class. Training, in short, makes a pure white with 100 percent F.F.V. blood in his veins into a perfect slave and makes a cruel master out of a black man. "Train- ing is everything," Twain reminds us in one of the book's chapter head- ings. "The peach was once a bitter almond; cauliflower is nothing but cabbage with a college education." But despite the Pudd'nhead Wilson chapter heading, Twain did not think training was everything. He believed that temperament was just as crucial a factor as training in determining a person's character and behavior. He also believed what no psychologist would accept today: that temperament was acquired at birth. "Temperament," he said, "is the law of God written in the heart of every creature by God's own hand, and must be obeyed, and will be obeyed in spite of all restricting or for- bidding statutes, let them emanate whence they may." Elsewhere he wrote that "the basis or moral skeleton" of a man is "inborn disposition - a thing which is as permanent as rock, and never undergoes any actual and genuine change between cradle and grave." In Pudd'nhead Wilson , Twain's belief that temperaments are born, southwest Review 153</page><page sequence="5">not made, produces a basic ambiguity of intention and leads him danger- ously close to a belief in innate racial traits≈° Though Twain makes it clear that Roxy's baby Tim was spoiled by overindulgent adults, he also says that Tom was "a bad baby, from the beginning of his usurpation" and he speaks of his "native viciousness." He also has Roxy say, "It's de nigger in you, dat's what it is," when she learns her son has behaved like a coward and refused a challenge to a duel. "Ain't nigger enough in him to show in his finger-nails," she exclaims on another occasion, "en dat takes mighty little - yit dey 's enough to paint his soul." But the main point of the novel is the power of training rather than of inborn disposi- tions in molding men; and in putting these words into Roxy's mouth Twain may simply have been showing how thoroughly she had absorbed the racial views of her masters. But neither training nor temperament was all-powerful in Twain's philosophy. In some of his writings, Twain singled out a third factor for emphasis: circumstances. Neither "religion, training nor education," he once wrote, "avails anything against the force of circumstances that drive a man." Twain talked about circumstances where it is customary to speak of accidents (or what the Germans call the "malice of objects"). By circumstances he meant unanticipated incidents bringing about important changes in a person's life. He called them circumstances rather than acci- dents because he thought the latter word obscured the fact that the unforeseen conjuncture of two events redirecting the course of people's lives was just as causally determined as any other kind of happening. "... I am not able to conceive of such a thing as ... an accident - that is to say, an event without a cause," he declared. "Each event has its own place in the eternal chain of circumstances. Circumstances, in short, were links in the inevitable series of incidents constituting a person's life." Picking out the special circumstances making his own life what it was became something of a game for Twain. Writing on "The Turning-Point of My Life" for Harper's Bazaar in 1910, the last year of his life, Twain singled out catching measles as a boy and finding a fifty-dollar bill on the street when he was a young man as crucial turning-points in his own life. But he regarded neither of them (nor any of the other turning- points mentioned in the article) as accidental. Turning-points, he said, were simply conspicuous links in the long chain of turning-points making up one's life; each link takes its appointed place at its appointed time. "A person may plan as much as he wants to," he wrote, "but nothing of 154 spring 1978</page><page sequence="6">consequence is likely to come of it until the magician Circumstance steps in and takes the matter off his hands." Man thus lives under the "dictatorship of Circumstance"; circumstance is "man's master - and when Grcumstance commands he must obey." In ruling out chance (the fortuitous encounter of separate and unique events) as an explanation for what happens in the world, Twain made it clear that he was a fatalist rather than a necessitarian and that he was unaware of the important part that chance played in such scientific formulations as the kinetic theory of gases and Darwin's law of natural selection. What Twain would have made of Werner Heisenberg^ prin- ciple of uncertainty or indeterminacy (according to which it is possible to generalize about the average behavior of large numbers of subatomic particles but impossible to measure the precise behavior of single par- ticles) it is difficult to say. While Twain was expounding his fatalistic philosophy, Charles S. Peirce, mathematician, physicist, and philosopher who anticipated Heisen- berg, was developing a system of thought in which chance, probability, novelty, and growth, as well as regularity and uniformity, were basic constituents of the universe. "Try to verify any law of nature," said Peirce, "and you will find that the more precise your observations, the more certain they will be to show irregular departures from the law." The facts of growth and increasing complexity in nature could not, in Peirce's opinion, be explained by mechanical forces; mechanical pro- cesses, he noted, were reversible, but evolutionary processes were not. "The endless variety in the world," he insisted, has not been created by law. It is not of the nature of uniformity to originate variation, nor of law to beget circumstance. When we gaze on the multi- fariousness of nature we are looking straight into the face of a living spon- taneity. A day s ramble in the country ought to bring that home to us. On one level, of course, Twain subscribed to Peirce's view: he recog- nized the richness, variety, and seemingly endless novelties of life on the Mississippi, and he was also impressed by the chance encounters, acci- dental happenings, and surprising turning-points in his own life. On another level, however, he found the idea of chance, novelty, and spon- taneity intolerable, and when he came to philosophize he espoused a doctrine of mechanistic fatalism and moral nonresponsibility that denied his own enormous creativity and unquenchable moral fervor. Somehow, SOUTHWEST Review 155</page><page sequence="7">Twain felt better if he could believe that whatever happened (especially if things went wrong) was precisely fated to happen. He might not like it, but at least it wasn't his fault. The responsibility was training's, tem- perament's, or circumstance's, not Twain's. Years later, attorney Clarence Darrow used similar reasoning to get reduced sentences for convicted criminals. In What Is Man?, printed privately in 1906 and circulated among friends, Twain attempted a systematic exposition of his mechanistic views in the form of a dialogue between an old man (the mature Twain telling it like it is) and a young man (the boyish Twain full of illusions). But Twain says nothing new here; the old points are made repeatedly. Train- ing and temperament, according to the old man, account for whatever people think, say, and do. "From the cradle to the grave, during all his waking hours," he says, "the human being is under training. . . . The influences about him create his preferences, his aversions, his politics, his tastes, his morals, his religion. He creates none of these things for him- self. He thinks he does, but that is because he has not examined into the matter." Man's "make", i.e., his temperament or disposition, moreover, is inborn; people are born cheerful or gloomy, happy or miserable. And a "Master Impulse," the drive for self-approval, motivates every decision we make. Upshot? "You and I are but sewing-machines. We must turn out what we can; we must do our endeavor and care nothing at all when the unthinking reproach us for not turning out Gobelins." What Is Man? (which Twain called his "Bible") has little artistic merit But The Mysterious Stranger , a short novel representing another effort by Twain to explain his views toward the end of his life, possesses the beauty and power of his best writing. Where What Is Man? stressed temperament and training in explaining human behavior, The Mysterious Stranger (edited and published by Albert Paine after Twain's death) em- phasized "circumstances." The story is simple enough. A handsome young man strolls one afternoon into a sleepy little sixteenth-century Austrian town and makes himself known to Theodor, boy narrator of the story, and his friends Nikolaus and Seppl. The stranger, Philip Traum, says he is the nephew of Satan, performs a series of breathtaking miracles for the boys, and also intercedes in astonishing ways in the lives of the villagers. But the emphasis of the story is on the stranger's chats with the boys and his revelations about the nature and destiny of man. Twain's stranger, it quickly becomes clear, possesses Twain's contradictions as 156 spring 1978</page><page sequence="8">well as his philosophy. He sneers at the moral sense but passes judgment on people. And he castigates people for doing things they were fated to do. He is a chronically indignant fatalist. It is significant that Twain's spokesman in The Mysterious Stranger is a supernatural or transcendent being rather than an ordinary mortal. The exponent of mechanistic fatalism, Twain seemed finally to realize, must be free even if no one else is, for he must assume, if he is to be taken seriously, that he has transcended his own deterministic framework and is voicing opinions reached by rational analysis and not simply me- chanically generated. But the fatalistic opinions which Twain expressed in his last important piece of writing utterly demolished all forms of human creativity, including the science from which he thought he had learned his fatalism, and they must be regarded as revelations of his own despairing state of mind rather than as compelling insights into the nature of things. Like Twain in the bitterest moments, the Mysterious Stranger regards human beings as miserable slaves. They are, he says, filled with shams and delusions. They think they are superior beings, the highest form of life, and the center of the universe, but in plain fact they are weak and silly and by turns cowardly and cruel. They enjoy torturing heretics, burning witches, and slaughtering each other in ways utterly unknown to the animal kingdom. The history of the human race, as Philip re- creates it at one point for the boys, is an unrelieved story of wars, mur- ders, and massacres. But having laid bare the ignorance, folly, and superstition of the human race, Philip goes on to reveal that it is all really inescapable. Man has no control over his destiny; everything he does is part of an inevitable series of acts that commenced with his very first act. He is predestined, in short, to be damned; and there is no saving remnant in Twain's scheme as there was in Jonathan Edwards's. Human beings are like dominoes. "Among you boys," young Satan explains, you have a game: you stand a row of bricks on end a few inches apart; you push a brick, it knocks its neighbor over, the neighbor knocks over the next brick - and so on till all the row is prostrate. That is human life. A child's first act knocks over the initial brick, and the rest will follow inexorably . . . nothing can change the order of its life after the first event has determined it. That is, nothing will change it, because each act unfailingly begets an act, that act begets another, and so on to the end. southwest Review 157</page><page sequence="9">So rigidly is each act bound to its predecessor in the chain of life, that to change an act in a person's chain is to alter that person's career completely. All acts, moreover, are "of one size and importance"; to "snatch at an appointed fly is as big with fate for you as is any other appointed act." If Columbus as a boy had skipped "the triflingest little link" in the chain of acts set in motion by his first childish act, it would have altered his whole subsequent life. It would also have altered the course of history, for he would not have become an explorer and discov- ered America. But no one ever does drop a link. Even when a person is trying to make up his mind what to do, the deliberation itself is a link in his life-chain. And if he decided to try to drop a link, "thai project would itself be an unavoidable link - a thought bound to occur to him at that precise moment, and made certain by the first act of his baby- hood." Theodor is profoundly disturbed by these revelations about man's fate. "He is a prisoner for life," he observes sadly, "and cannot get free." "No," says Philip, "of himself he cannot get away from the consequences of his first childish act. But," he adds, "I can free him." But the freedom he bestows turns out to involve death or insanity. By using his miraculous powers Philip proceeds to change tiny links in the life-chains of several of the villagers and thus completely alters the course of their lives. He intervenes briefly in the lives of little Lisa Brandt and Theodors friend Nikolaus, with momentous results. Under the old chain it was appointed that Nikolaus would save Lisa from drowning. But by changing one seemingly trivial act in Nikolaus's life, Philip causes the boy to arrive on the scene too late to save the girl, who by this time has struggled into deeper water, and when he tries to rescue her both are drowned. Theodor is horrified by what Philip has done. But Philip explains that if the original chain of events had been unbroken and Nikolaus had saved Lisa, he would have caught cold afterward, con- tracted scarlet fever, and spent the rest of his life as "a paralytic log, deaf, dumb, blind, and praying night and day for the blessed relief of death." As for Lisa, if she had survived she would have gone on to a life of crime ending in death at the hands of the executioner. (Twain did not explain, because he could not, why the change Philip made in Nikolaus's life-chart, which altered Lisa's destiny, did not also change the lives of their parents and friends, including Theodor, and then vil- lage, country, continent, and, ultimately, world history.) Overwhelmed by news of the drownings, Nikolaus's mother bitterly reproaches her- 158 spring 1978</page><page sequence="10">self for having, she feels, caused the disaster. And Theodor then reflects: It shows how foolish people are when they blame themselves for anything they have done. Satan knows, and he said nothing happens that your first act hasn't arranged to happen and made inevitable; and so, of your own motion you can't ever alter the scheme or do a thing that will break a link. When Lisa's mother hears of the tragedy, she goes mad with grief; and at Theodors request Philip agrees to alter the poor woman's future. He makes a slight change in her life-chain and she ends by being burned at the stake for uttering blasphemies. To the shocked Theodor, Philip patiently explains that the alteration saved the woman twenty-nine more years of earthly misery. Death, then, seems to be the only way to achieve freedom from the heartbreaks and horrors making up human existence. There is one other possibility: insanity. The Mysterious Stranger sees to it that Father Peter, a kindly old man unjustly charged with theft, receives this particular re- lease. Father Peter eventually receives an acquittal; but before he learns about it, Philip visits him in jail and tells him he was convicted as a thief and forever disgraced. The shock unseats the old man's reason; he develops delusions of grandeur and imagines that he is the Emperor. Thereafter, he is, Philip tells Theodor, "the one utterly happy person in this empire." When Theodor protests, Philip presses the point: "Are you so unobservant as not to have found out that sanity and happiness are an impossible combination? No sane man can be happy for to him life is real, and he sees what a fearful thing it is. Only the mad can be happy, and not many of those." But since not even many of the insane are happy, it is clear that the chief means of release from the deterministic chain of horror and misery that constitutes life is death. Twain makes this point time and again in his story. When Gottfried Narrs grandmother is charged with witch- craft and quickly confesses even though it means burning at the stake, her (and Twain's) reasoning is: "If I hadn't they might have set me free. That would ruin me; for no one would forget that I had been sus- pected of being a witch, and so I would get no more work, and wherever I went they would set the dogs on me. In a little while I would starve. The fire is best; it is soon over." Is there any other road to freedom except through death? Would it ever be possible to start a new chain of life going which would be free southwest Review 159</page><page sequence="11">of the intolerabilities of the old chain? At one point in The Mysterious Stranger Twain suggests another possible cure for the human predica- ment short of death: laughter. But he is not sure that man's sense of humor is sufficiently developed to be of much help. "You have a bastard perception of humor," Philip tells Theodor, nothing more; a multitude of you possess that. This multitude sees the comic side of a thousand low-grade and trivial things - broad incongruities, mainly; grotesqueries, absurdities, evokers of the horse-laugh. The ten thousand high- grade comicalities which exist in the world are sealed from their presence. The ten thousand are hid from the entire race. Asked to name some "high-grade comicalities," Philip singles out religion and politics for special scorn. "No religion exists," he exclaims, "which is not littered with engaging and delightful comicalities, but the race never perceives them." Hereditary royalties and aristocracies are also "deliciously comical," but so are republics and democracies. "All forms of government . . . ," Philip presses on, "are rich in funny shams and absurdi- ties, but their supporters do not see it." But the chief comicality is religion, Papal or Presbyterian, and Philip returns to the church time and again to show his contempt for it. And at length he muses: Will a day come when the race will detect the funniness of these juvenilities and laugh at them - and by laughing at them destroy them? For your race, in its poverty, has unquestionably one really effective weapon - laughter. Power, Money, Persuasion, Supplication, Persecution - these can lift a colossal humbug - push it a little - crowd it a little - weaken it a little, century by century: but only Laughter can blow it to rags and atoms at a blast. Against the assault of Laughter nothing can stand. In laughter, then, there does seem to be a glimmer of hope for humanity. But do people have the sense and courage to laugh their illusions out of existence? Perhaps not. Philip is not sanguine about the possibility. Still, he suggests, if human beings were to succeed in blowing their juvenile beliefs to pieces by a blast of laughter, perhaps they could at long last begin living as truly free beings, willing and able to face the hard demands of life honestly and courageously and without the deceptive solace of childish illusions. Chiefest of the illusions incapacitating people for mature living, Twain had concluded, was the Christian religion, particularly in its 160 spring 1978</page><page sequence="12">fundamentalistic form. Christianity, with its anthropomorphic God, sickly conscience, Puritan moral code, special providences, heaven and hell, and its belief that man was "the chief love and delight of God," had vic- timized people for centuries, Twain thought, and had kept them in bond- age to "pure and simple insanities." "Strange, indeed," Philip exclaims in his last communication to Theodor, "that you should not have suspected that your universe and its contents were only dreams, visions, fiction! Strange, because they are so frankly and hysterically insane - like all dreams." At the same time he reveals that he himself has no objective existence, but is merely a part of Theodor's own consciousness: I am but a dream - your dream, creature of your imagination. In a moment you will have realized this, then you will banish me from your visions and I shall dissolve into the nothingness out of which you made me. . . . But I, your poor servant, have revealed you to yourself and set you free. Dream other dreams, and better! For Twain it was too late to dream other dreams. He never freed him- self from the spell of orthodox Christianity. To the end, the Christian world view in its most fundamentalistic form shaped his view of reality. Though he made fun of it, heaped scorn on it, and lashed out against it in fury, he could never get it out of his mind for long. Both What Is Man? and The Mysterious Stranger , for all their rebelliousness, discuss life essentially in orthodox Christian terms; and Letters from the Earth (an uncompleted manuscript of his last years), though it is a sustained attack on the biblical view of the world and on the Christian attitude toward sex, is also placed in a scriptural setting. At times Adam and Eve and Jehovah and Satan seem to have been as real for Twain as such friends as Twichell and Howells. When he dictated his reflections on religion to Albert Paine in June, 1904, Twain tried hard to distinguish between the vindictive God of the Old Testament, who brought sin into the world and then blamed man for it, and the sublime God of modern deism who brought this stupendous universe with its myriad wonders into being with one flash of thought and framed its immutable laws with another. But almost immediately he finds himself blasting the Deist God as cruel and malicious, too, for creating a world in which life preys on life and for foreordaining all the miseries of man down to the tiniest details: SOUTHWEST Review 161</page><page sequence="13">God has so contrived him that all his goings out and comings in are beset by traps which he cannot possibly avoid and which compel him to commit what are called sins - and God punishes him for doing these very things which from the beginning of time He has always intended that he should do. Thomas Paine would have been appalled by Twain's confusion of the Deist God with the God of Calvinism. Intellectually Twain had been chafing at the orthodox Christian con- ception of things since early manhood; but emotionally he was never able to emancipate himself from the teachings of his boyhood Calvinism. He was born, it seemed to him, with an ineradicable sense of guilt; he had Puritan morality inexpungeably drilled into him as a child; and though he strove to do right in his life and work, circumstances had a way of overpowering him at every turn. Twain became increasingly bit- ter as he learned, in blow after blow, that life simply didn't square with the religion he had learned in his Hannibal Sunday School. The sudden loss of his daughter Susy while he was abroad in 1896, his wife Livy's long illness, decline, and death in 1904, and his daughter Jean's epilepsy and abrupt death in 1909 were like swords thrust into his heart, although he said he was "glad, for the sake of the dead, that they have escaped." But human suffering could not be reconciled with a benevolent God. Nor could the vast implacable universe revealed by modern science be harmonized with the notion that man was the chief delight of God. Furthermore, the hypocrisy, sanctimoniousness, and stupid prejudices of pious Americans and the intolerance and cruelty of organized religion through the ages belied the commonly accepted belief that Christianity elevated human nature. And the harsh Christian moral code, especially when it came to sex, ran counter to the vigorous life-force animating all creation. But if the Christian universe was only a dream, was there anything but dreams? Was it all unreal, untrue? Was life itself an illusion? Shortly after Livy's death following a prolonged illness that Twain said almost killed him, his friend Twichell wrote to ask how things were going with him. In his reply, Twain expressed for a moment solipsistic sentiments similar to those appearing at the very end of The Mysterious Stranger : ... (a part of each day - or night) as they have been looking to me the past 7 years: as being NON-EXISTENT. That is, that there is nothing. That there is no God and no universe; and that there is only empty space, and in 162 SPRING 1978</page><page sequence="14">it a lost and homeless and wandering and companionless and indestructible Thought. And that I am that thought. And God, and the Universe, and Time, and Life, and Death, and Joy and Sorrow and Pain only a grotesque and brutal dream , evolved from the frantic imagination of that insane Thought. "And so," he concluded, after another blast at the Old Testament God, "a part of each day Livy is a dream and has never existed." But then he added soberly: "The rest of it she is real, and is gone. Then comes the ache and continues."</page></plain_text>
