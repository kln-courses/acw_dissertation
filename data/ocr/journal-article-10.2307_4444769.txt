<plain_text><page sequence="1">WILD HORSE RUNNING, by Sam Savitt. 1973. Dodd, Mead &amp; Co., New York. 126 p. $4.95 (hardback). The setting of this delightful book is the Pryor Mountains of Montana-a sanctuary for wild horses. It is a story well worth the telling, and Sam Savitt is the ideal author. The many illustra- tions, as well as the general format of the book, are attractive. However, the author at times reveals a strong ten- dency toward anthropomorphism. This is a natural tendency among true ani- mal-lovers, and, on second thought, may even enhance reader appeal. I do have doubts about the book's value as high-school reference reading in the more or less formalized program today. Its only transfer value to high- school biology would center on the Pryor Mountains sanctuary as an ex- ample of much-needed ecologic wild- life preserves. Although the book fol- lows the Born Free concept used in many other animal stories, it also pos- sesses a character-building quality de- signed to influence readers, particularly those of upper-elementary and junior- high age. It is in this group that the book would find its greatest appeal. Robert L. Gantert Nathan Hale High School Seattle, Wash.</page></plain_text>
