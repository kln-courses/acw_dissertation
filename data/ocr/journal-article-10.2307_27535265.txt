Worth-while Readers?i hour, ^rj minutes, 23 seconds. ?Apologies to very popular magazines which efficiently supply this irrele vant data for very busy readers. W'E have all complacently at one time or another announced ourselves guilty of taking or finding time. And since find ing was keeping, we proceeded to keep the time in question, even going so far as to distract it, to pass or spend it. Nor have we shuddered to confess that finally we wasted, stole, marked, beat, and even killed time. We needed no Baudelaire to remind us that "the slaying of the monster Time is the most ordinary occu pation of man". We have put time off and on; we have stated it gone or due; we have measured it high, and even had the au dacity to consider ourselves on time. With Mrs. Hugh Bell and Arthur Cecil, we have even agreed to declare that "Time is Money". It suggests itself that this cocky familiarity with time arises from the philosophical conception of time as absolute. There were certain philosophers, such as Parmenides and Philo, who chose to emphasize the "endless duration of eternity", the permanence of the ultimate reality. This attitude toward eternity came to be applied to time itself which was, according to Plato, an image of eternity. With Newton's Principia (1686-7) absolute time was defined as "true mathematical time unrelated to anything external". This "conceptual absolute uniformly flowing Time" was the real thing; we could be certain it existed; we could be sure of slaying something objectively real when we killed it. Later on, Spinoza and Santayana made the attempt to "contemplate objects under the form of eternity". If they contrasted time with eternity, it was the latter they emphasized as real, and the concept of eternity</page><page sequence="2">COUNTERCLOCKWISE 339 often leaked over to the concept of time as real, absolute, objective. For Spaulding, today, time is absolute and "subsists whether any thing exists in it or not". This kind of Time was of course a simple, effective literary in gredient. Because of it, the classical unity of time could be more or less enforced. And with that conception in mind, people could mouth the maxim, "Time is the wisest thing in the world be cause it produces all knowledge; but there is nothing more fool ish than Time which never retains anything very long." These people knew Time well; he was a manageable fellow. If they ever stopped for a moment to consider that time was not so steady as they had thought, they would merely with Ovid endow him with a gnawing tooth and leave him, not themselves, in pain. Petrarch took advantage of this absolute conception to ask Time to obtain some revenge for him; but when he refused to do his bidding Petrarch sneakily observed that Time owned an ember with which he knew how to cheat. In the seventeenth century Time assumed a shape even more definite and absolute. To Aurelean Townshend he was an "aged man that mows these fields"; to William Browne he was possessed of a dart which frequently made for some very good poetry. Among the romantics this concept was always an easy means of rounding out a line. Coleridge was so good as to give Time a wild harp; and Shelley thought of himself as mounting the steps of an objective absolute called Time. A pinch of Time, capitalized, sprinkled here and there, was always a good romantic recipe. Browning later on, when he sputtered out, Fool! all that is at all Lasts ever past recall was again reverting to the philosophy that applied the attributes of eternity to Time. To Carlyle, Time was a set of underwear that was better off than on. He had begun to sense that Time might hide eternity. Some years later Robert Pollick in The Course of Time sang with perfect impunity time born and gone. As recently as 1927, Kahlil Gibran could compare time "undivided and paceless" with love. They were sure of time, these writers. They knew what he wore, how he looked, what he carried in his hand; they could cajole him, and then he would sit prettily on a verse. But it is</page><page sequence="3">340 by MADELEINE B. STERN doubtful whether they ever thought very seriously about time. All of us who meditate on the second-hand of a watch; who cross an ocean and realize the arbitrary nature of time, who contem plate the spheres and clepsydras, the sun-dials and horologes, the clocks with their inscriptions to the effect that time passes, must conclude that time cannot be so easily pigeon-holed. The gnawing tooth of time begins to hurt us. Time may still be an objective reality that mows a field but the mowing itself, the passage, is more important than objective time. With Cicero, there have been some writers who have agreed that "difficile est Tempus definir?", some writers who have mocked that complacent exactitude of Mil ham when he states that "it is at the Naval Observatory in Wash ington, D.C., that time is determined with extreme accuracy and distributed over the whole country east of the Rocky Mountains." Among the Greeks, Chronos was a being who begat and devoured children. Among the writers who stopped to consider time and wonder at its passage, time was still something objective divided into three parts, past, present and future; but it had a distressing attribute: it passed. James W. Benson in his Time and Time Tellers well defines this concept. Time is naturally divided into three most unequal parts,? whereof the Past includes all that has happened until now . . .; the Present is but a moment, expended in a breath, the Future is, as the Past,?"a wide unbounded prospect," This attitude may be called one that asserts the discontinuous pas sage of time. Time is important because it passes; and it passes in discrete instants, each of which may be demarked from the next. In most cases this time is still counted absolute: it exists apart from all else; but it passes. Threefold is of Time the tread; Lingering comes the future pacing hither; Dart-like is the now gone thither; Stands the past aye moveless foot and head. This is the theme which, with variations, has been repeated from Biblical days to the present by men who have stopped to think fairly seriously about time. In the Old Testament "time is ever flowing and never stays; it is a vessel charged with birth and death; it has a 'before' and 'after,' a 'will be' and a 'was' " So in</page><page sequence="4">COUNTERCLOCKWISE 341 the Koran, with order, but with incessant movement, "He maketh the night to follow the day, and He maketh the day to follow the night." Thus too did Roger Bacon's Brazen Head proclaim; "Time is,?Time was;?Time's past!" Shakespeare observed the same condition when he wrote Time is a very bankrupt? Nay he's a thief too; have you not heard men say That time comes stealing on by night and day? Shelley's Prometheus sits down to "talk of time and change as the world ebbs and flows". Matthew Arnold called time a river and conceived it as divided into three parts. More recently, in L. A. H. Dickinson's play, the only joke that never gets a laugh is "Time flies. Time ought to take a commission in the Flying Corps." And Moody says, From deep to deep she varies pace And while she comes is gone. Ralph Hodgson beseeches a time that lived "last week in Babylon, last night in Rome" to put up his caravan just for one day. We need no more instances to prove that writers have stated the fact that time flies. Behind their belief that time was an objective phenomenon, which passed discontinuously, were the statements of many philosophers from Buddha to Boodin. The Buddhistic doctrines were all a means of escape from the flux of time. Her aclitus of Miletus proposed the famous river into which no one could step twice. Plato's doctrine was a cross between those of Heraclitus and Parmenides. He distinguishes "simultaneous ex istence going through futurity, presentness and pastness". Time is an image of eternity, but also "a moving image of eternity". The twentieth century Mackenzie likewise states that "change is the concrete fact of which time is the formal order". For Aristotle time was inextricably connected with change. For the Stoic the universe is "a rhythm of cycles" in which time is motion. And Augustine also writes that "the present hour passeth away in flying particles". It is not x&gt;ne of the consolations that Boethius sees that "the now . .. that flies away makes Time." Thus Marcus Aurelius meditates:</page><page sequence="5">342 by MADELEINE B. STERN Time is like a river made up of events which happen, and a violent stream; for as soon as a thing has been, it is carried away, and another comes in its place, and this will be carried away too. For Aquinas, time is succession, Though Locke adds another idea to this conception, one to be later examined, he too sees time as duration set out by measures. One of the reasons for the vanity of existence to Schopenhauer was "the ever-passing present mo ment", in time which "is that in which all things pass away". In deed, one of his twenty-eight propositions concerning time is that "Time has no permanence, but passes away as soon as it is there". Another is that "Time has three divisions: the past, the present, and the future". The combination of these two propositions gives us the doctrine of the discontinuous passage of time from past to present to future, each division dearly marked off from the next. With Lotze, Wundt, and Renouvier time is an objective "ever changing present". Today one philosopher after another states this belief. We have but to name them: Whitehead, Bosanquet, William James, Hartley Alexander, Charles Nordmann, Emile Borel, Boodin?For them all time and change are bound together; they may disagree in regard to other aspects of time, but they are one in recognizing that time is a "perpetual perishing". II. In literature this concept was expressed with three different at titudes according to the disposition of the writer and his epoch. Some writers hated time and its ravages; others worshipped it for its powers to heal; still others sought to grasp the hour before it slipped away. In each instance the attitude was occasioned by time's incessant passing. Among those who hated the ravages of an anthropomorphic time was Horace whose emblem, Tempus, edax rerum tuque in vidiosa vetustas, clever time-keepers inscribed on their clocks. Unlike Ovid, Horace himself felt the gnawing of that tooth. Petrarch too rebelled against the "days wind-swift", and wept "Alas ! that Time is fled, that time is ended." Nor can one forget Marlowe's Dr. Faustus who implores, "Stand still, you ever moving spheres of Heaven, that time may cease and midnight</page><page sequence="6">COUNTERCLOCKWISE 343 never come". It was Baudelaire who longed for the land of Cock aigne where "slower hours contain more thoughts, where the clocks strike the hours of happiness with a more profound and significant solemnity". Recall also the Eternal Urger of Hardy's Dynasts, "pressing change on change". Dunsany's time wrought by its passage the overthrow of "the city of the gods, Sardathrion". A few twentieth century writers have bemoaned in the same manner. In Elizabeth Robins' Time is Whispering, "the passage of the years had left their graver mark". Conrad Seiler in his play, Time Will Tell, reminds us mournfully that Time waits for no man Time waits for none. On the other hand, some writers have benignly accepted the passage of time because of its healing powers. Christina Rossetti bids us Hope, hope! old Time flies fast upon his way, And soon will cease the night, and soon will dawn the day. There is a group of nineteenth century English and American writers who are content with time's passing. Curiously, the age and the writer reveal themselves by their attitudes to time. In 1845 Douglas Jerrold's Time Works Wonders marked the happy reunions brought about for lovers by time's changes. The same marvel is recorded in John Courtney's Time Tries All (1848). After twenty-five years, Lillie and Creigelthorpe are joined at last in Anne Marsh-Calswell's novel, Time the Avenger (1851). In nocence thought guilt gains its true status by the passage of time in Henry Leslie's play (1867). Time tries and deepens love in F. E. M. Notley's novel, Time Shall Try (1878). Twenty-three years clear up the difficulties about a forgery and secret marriage in Herbert Garner's Time Will Tell (1882). Elbert Hubbard of course sees Time and Chance as opportunities for benign miracles in the life of John Brown. Arnold Bennett's attitude to time is that it is essentially good, because by its passage the three di mensions of human life are revealed. "Through an infinite num ber of infinitesimal changes" wrought by time, he can make the five towns live in all their breadth and depth. More recently, Leonard Merrick in Time, the Humorist, shows how benignly</page><page sequence="7">344 by MADELEINE B. STERN ironic the effects of time's passing can be. For in his story, the stupid wife of a brilliant critic becomes a popular playwright. Even the twentieth century has its Victorian reverberations. Arthur Henry lauds time for bringing back old loves, in Time (1924). William Everett Cram, in his essays about farming, sinks back pleased because though time rises and falls, it always rises again, and is of course good for the growth of vegetables. The Soviet attitude is clearly sketched in Valentine Kataev's novel, Time, Forward! (1933) m which the tempos of work, the ticking of the clock, make possible the race for industrial advancement. There is a third division of writers on this subject who neither reject nor accept time, but who, observing that it passes, determined to seize each moment and derive from it all the richness it can offer. Such a carpe diem philosophy is, of course, proposed in Herrick's "Gather ye rosebuds", where rosebuds may be identi fied with instants. In her diary Christina Rossetti reminds us that "Time is short and swift and never returns" and that there fore we should redeem time. Again: "Time is shortening; soul, fulfill thy week: Short is time". It was the same acknowledgment of the flux of time, that led Walter Pater to his philosophy of art for art's sake. Since each instant flies, we must grasp each moment for that moment's sake. Pater rightly feared that this philosophy might lead the younger generation to commit a num ber of follies in their efforts to gather every rosebud that came their way. Henry Van Dyke expresses the same attitude when, writing of the sun-dial at Wells College, he says : The Shadow by my fingers cast Divides the future from the past: . . . One hour alone is in thy hands,? The NOW on which the shadow stands. Aldous Huxley chooses the Carpe Npctem aspect of this idea when he writes, "There is no future, there is no past, No roots, nor fruits, but momentary flowers." A few writers could neither accept nor reject the benignity or malignity of time's passing, nor could they erect a philosophy upon the fact that time flies. In order to escape from the flux of time, they turned to fantasy. Thus we get our friends Peter Pan and Martin, boys who being dream boys could withstand the</page><page sequence="8">COUNTERCLOCKWISE 345 flood of time, and remain forever young. In Barrie's Neverland there is no necessity for Peter to have a sense of time, for "Peter is ever so old, but he is really always the same age". So in Martin's vision in Christopher Morley's Thunder on the Left, Martin alone stands still against the sluice of time. There was another way of cheating time, a less fantastic, more absorbing way. For instead of blinding their eyes in fantasies, writers began to perceive that one hour could really be a minute or a year according to the way in which you felt when you ex perienced that hour. This doctrine of the subjectivity of time also finds a basis in philosophy. From Lucretius to Pringle Pattison there have been philosophers who have either given the cue or the endorsement to literary statements concerning time's subjectivity. Lucretius expressed the idea of time as percept rather than as concept in his De Rerum Natura when he wrote : Time of itself is Nothing, but from Thought Receives its Rise; To Augustine, time was similarly measured by the soul. "There is a present of things present in immediate perception, a present of things past in memory and a present of things future in expectation or imagination." We begin to see the working of the terms, memory and anticipation, rather than the objective before-and after relationship in this subjective toward time. Descartes also considered time as a mode of thinking. Augus tine's idea recurs with Hobbe's statement that "the present only has a being in nature; things past have a being in memory only; but things to come have no being at all, the future being but a fiction of the mind". Locke it was who first suggested the con trast between the objective and subjective definitions of time. He asserted that through the idea of succession in the mind, time is perceived. La Place's definition of time resembles that of Locke: "Time is to us the impression left upon our memory by a series of events whose existence we know to have been successive." Con dillac's words are again suggestive of Locke when he states that "each one judges of it [duration] by the succession of his ideas." In the eighteenth century Berkeley continued with the idea of time's "being nothing abstracted from the succession of ideas in</page><page sequence="9">346 by MADELEINE B. STERN our minds." Berkeley also gives expression to the notion that time differs "in the same man according to whether he is pleased or pained." Hume reiterates Locke and Berkeley when he defines time as arising from our "succession of ideas and impressions." A repetition of Berkeley's notion of time's expanding or contract ing with the condition of the perceiver appears in Swedenborg. To Kant time was "the form of our internal intuition", and so its reality was purely subjective. It cannot exist without a perceiv ing consciousness. Kant's subjectivist attitude was developed by Teichmuller. Thus the idea grows. From the late nineteenth century to the present year one philosopher after another has expressed himself an adherent of the idea of the subjectivity of time. Reflection, memory, anticipation create the idea of time. In that point we find the galaxy agreed; a galaxy including Shadworth Hodgson, Alfred H. Lloyd, R. A. P. Rogers, Gaston Rageot. A school of these psychological metaphysicists is headed by Gentile. And thus speaks the great exponent of the subjectivity of time, Henri Bergson: "As regards the psychical life unfolding beneath the symbols which conceal it, we reaclily perceive that time is just the stuff it is made of." And the others who see time, not as a dis continuous stream divided into past, present and future, but as a malleable percept that owes its existence and its duration to a perceiving consciousness, are legion. They include such philos ophers as Pierre Janet, Norman Kemp Smith, McTaggart, Bos anquet, Pringle-Pattison, Guyau, and numbers of others. Only last year Richard T. Cox went so far as to say that "we can assign some events to either the past or future, as we please." III. It is not the intent of this article to prove that a definite causal relationship exists between concepts as expressed in philosophy and literature. Ideas have a curious way of floating about, and writers in the literary world may often seize them before they have been masticated by the philosophers. If the relationship is not causal, it is nevertheless often parallel. And we see the idea of the subjectivity of time expressed by writers who were troubled with time's incessant flow, and who escaped from the terror of that</page><page sequence="10">COUNTERCLOCKWISE 347 idea by surmounting time and proving themselves its masters. About 600 A.D. Gregory of Tours told the story of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus who slept for three hundred and seventy-two years, a subjective sleep in which they dreamed time away, a Rip Van Winkle sleep. And it was Frederick IPs Boniface who in one day lived forty years, was translated to Asia, became a warrior and founded a kingdom. Let us not forget, too, that Mohammed had 90,000 conversations with God while he washed his hands. So the mind vanquishes time. But it is not a series of marvels that the later writers related. They carried this subjective conquest of time into the region of human possibility. It is a natural thing with Blake to "hold infinity in the palm of your hand And eternity in an hour". Law rence Sterne in one of his Shandyish digressions shows that he knows his Locke when he reminds the reader "that the notion of duration ... is got merely from the train and succession of our ideas." Thus it is entirely plausible that the two hours and ten minutes since Dr. Slop and Obadiah arrived seem almost an age to Tristram's father. "Like the images in the inside of a lanthorn turned round by the heat of a candle" do Sterne's ideas succeed one another, and is his notion of time accordingly determined. The nineteenth century approaches the problem by returning, with Washington Irving, to Gregory of Tours. "Rip's story was soon told, for the whole twenty years had been to him but as one night." Irving himself refers us to a similar tale about the Em peror Frederick der Rothbart. Not only sleep, but drugs had the power, especially among the romantics, of destroying the reality of time. De Quincey felt this when he confessed, "The sense of space, and in the end the sense of time were both power fully affected . . . Sometimes I seemed to have lived a hundred years in one night; nay, sometimes had feelings representative of a duration far beyond the limits of any human experience." Re call the centuries for which De Quincey was compelled to live with the cursed crocodile. Baudelaire knew that a drug might be used to annihilate time. "If you would not feel the horrible burden of Time, you must be drunken without cease . . . Lest you be the martyrd salves of Time, intoxicate yourselves." In his prose poem, The Double Chambre, he indicates that under the influence</page><page sequence="11">348 by MADELEINE B. STERN of laudanum "minutes are no more; seconds are no more"; but when the influence has been removed, the hideous monarch reigns again. In the Glass Vendor he expresses the: possibility of finding "in one second an eternity of enjoyment". Christina Rosetti knew the trick, too, when she sang "Time greatly short. O Time so briefly long."; for it is we who contract and expand the mo ments. In her diary she checks herself for saying "At length the sun rose. At length? Scarcely. The sun kept time, though I kept it not: the sun lagged not because I hurried." But indeed it did. Her "At length" belies her. Byron was conscious of it too?for on one memorable occasion did he not register in a hotel as 99? Tenny son knew the power of thought over time when he wrote of the country of the lotus eaters, "A land in which it seemed always afternoon." For what is the lotus, but a form of laudanum? Longfellow, too, knew that a thousand years in our sight may be but as yesterday when it is past, for he retold Jacobus de Voragine's tale of Felix, the monk who heard the lark and for one hundred years prayed while it seemed to him but as one day. So Hardy mocked time in his Human Shows: "You are nought but a thought without reality", a thought that can be twisted to conform with our pleasures and pains. Nor should we forget Lewis Carroll's mad hatter who had only to "whisper a hint to Time, and round went the clock in a twinkling". Edward Bellamy used the Rip Van Winkle device to hurry time along one hundred years when, in Looking Backward, he made Julian West sleep the sleep of the subjective in his subterranean chamber. And who was the Con necticut Yankee but a sleepier Rip Van Winkle when Mark Twain allowed him to drift out of time and sleep for thirteen centuries? Andreyev knew that the mind under the influence of life in prison would have a strange effect on time; for "the seventeen days passed as rapidly as a single day, filled with a single thought" to Michka the Tzigane. All of us know that the commonplace routine days fly breathlessly, whereas the days that are filled with novelty and richness are not days but centuries. Elbert Hubbard recognized the possibility of the soul's traversing years in ten minutes when he wrote of John Brown's fainting spell in Time and Chance. And the same idea has filtered through to our century. H. G.</page><page sequence="12">COUNTERCLOCKWISE 349 Wells turns the idea to his own pseudo-scientific purposes when he writes in The New Accelerator of the precious phial that can "double time"; that can make a boy "an adult at eleven, middle aged at twenty-five, and by thirty well on the road to senile decay". He knew the device of the retarder too, which makes "everything in the world . . . seem to ... go ever so many thousand times slower than it ever went before". In the Bulpington of Blup he comprehended that when time is unperceived, it ceases. Again, in The Time Machine he states that "there is no difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our consciousness moves along with it." That our consciousness does not always move along with time, but frequently outstrips it, pull ing it after it, until time itself flies quickly, is apparent in Am brose Bierce's story, In the Midst of Life. Peyton Farquhar, in the noose, ready for hanging, lives for ages and travels a whole day through water and forest until he reaches home; at that moment his neck is broken. Farquhar lived in reality for ages during that one moment; Spengler was conscious of this phenomenon when he wrote, "We create Time as an idea or notion and do not begin till much later to suspect that we ourselves are Time, inasmuch as we live." In 1914 Morley Roberts in Time and Thomas Waring returned to the Locke and Sterne definition when he wrote, "Time is only the successive register of impressions." For that reason Waring had a moment of pain that lasted "for long unmeasured eternities". And as he anticipated death "there were hours im measurably swift, and the next dragged as immeasurably slow", according to the content of his consciousness. Like Theodore in the Bulpington of Blup, Katherine Mansfield knew how to anni hilate time in a dream; knew how to toss at sea forever?at five o'clock. In 1920 Barrie's Mary Rose expressed the possibility of thinking twenty-five years a single hour in which an "incompre hensible jest" had been played. Similarly, Sacheverell Sitwell has demonstrated the possibility of living "All summer in a day". Most modern poets know, as Hildegarde Flanner knows, how to "let the heart reverse Time's sinister profile on the wall of night". As Proust puts it, "The time which we have at our disposal every day is elastic; the passions that we feel expand it, those that we inspire contract it." Marcel, like Rip, could sleep through in</page><page sequence="13">350 by MADELEINE B. STERN finity in an instant. The Wellsian device of improvising an in strument to quicken the passage of time is used by John Law rence Hodgson in The Time Journey of Dr. Barton where a jump from 1927 to 3927 takes place in three days. In 1931 Cohen Portheim indicated that he and Andreyev were brothers; for the former also knew that in an internment in England, time stands still: "where there is no aim, no object, no sense, there is no time". Last year O'Brien published a curious story by H. E. Bates in which the hands of a watch move according to the activity of the electricity within one man's body, and the energy in his mind. And on the recent New York stage, in A Sleeping Clergyman, James Bridie gives his minister a Rip Van Winkle sleep?for while he snores in the club room the three generations of Camerons go through their deeds of honor and splendor. There are two writers who have dealt with the subjectivity of time in a way that calls for less schematic study. One of them is Thomas Mann. The story of The Magic Mountain is the riddle brought to light, that the passage of time in no way depends on the rising and setting of suns. Hans Castorp, with his thermo meters and rugs and reclining chairs finds that there is no actual time, save the time that he perceives. "When it seems long to you, then it is long; when it seems short, why, then it is short." Thus the three weeks that had promised to crawl in such a snail like manner, rush by; "The refreshment of his sense of time" has passed; and the years fly. "Ah, time is a riddling thing, and hard it is to expound its essence!" Only in the act of measuring his temperature does he catch the weight of the seconds as they pass; then "the time crept on". It is on the basis of Mann's belief in the subjectivity of time that The Magic Mountain is written. For not only Hans Castorp, but the reader too, must feel the lengthen ing and shortening of time's passage with him. This has been Thomas Mann's purpose. In this he has succeeded. Because of his high metabolism, his fever, his routine of life, time is but a watch in the night to Castorp; and to us too, when we read. The book is a study of the time-element in which Hans Castorp lives; imperceptibly the days gain momentum as a stone thrown from a high building; imperceptibly is time's passage changed for us as we read.</page><page sequence="14">COUNTERCLOCKWISE 351 Virginia Woolf is the second writer who has attempted to de velop a philosophy of time. She writes in Orlando: The mind of man . . . works with . . . strangeness upon the body of time. An hour, once it lodges in the queer element of the human spirit, may be stretched to fifty or a hundred times its clock length; on the other hand, an hour may be accurately represented on the timepiece of the mind by one second. This idea is clearly carried out in Orlando. "Time when he is thinking becomes inordinately long; time when he is doing be comes inordinately short." Orlando's strange life is not harmon iously synchronized with the clock. He often "goes out after breakfast a man of thirty and comes home to dinner a man of fifty-five at least. Some weeks added a century to his age, others no more than three seconds at most." Thus it is possible for the variety of selves that is Orlando to live from the days of Elizabeth to 1928. For if Orlando thought that so much time had elapsed, then in reality it had. Orlando could out-Byron Byron and regis ter as 300. IV. Thus writers have manipulated this theme, using it to explain miracles, using it as pseudo-scientific devices, explaining by means of it their romantic aches and pains, breathing it into fantasies, weaving it into novels that have the glow of reality. Sometimes they even went a step further. If the mind can stretch an hour to a year or contract it to a moment, then the mind can also make the past live, by means of memory, in the present. For, in ac cordance with the idea of the subjectivity of time, if the past ex ists in the mind, it actually is present. For this notion also there is a philosophical background. In his discussion of Reflective History, Hegel states: "When we have to deal with the Past, and occupy ourselves with a remote world, a Present rises into being for the mind . . . This takes the occurrence out of the category of the Past and makes it virtually Present." The same idea is frequently reiterated by Bergson. In his scale of duration as a whole, "Our inner duration or human self-consciousness and memory" appear next to "Living eternity".</page><page sequence="15">352 by MADELEINE B. STERN The past is concentrated in Bergson's present?even the future is foreshadowed in it. As Wyndham Lewis puts it, "In his private time-sense a man can . . . pull up all his Past into his Present." Bergson stresses the point that "evolution implies a real persistence of the past in the present". Again he states that "the very basis of our conscious existence is memory, that is to say, the prolong ation of the past into the present". In real duration the present is big with the past; they melt together and form an organic whole. In slightly different terms, and more recently Josiah Royce has offered the same tid-bit for philosophic digestion. For him, "the present potentially interprets the past to the future". Thus also J. A. Leighton: "Memory is the unifying function which enables the individual in the present to control the future by the utiliza tion of the past in the present." It is a little more mystic than the adage, 'experience is the best teacher'; for our experiences still live with us now, and the time in which they happened still exists now. The idea of the existence of the past in the present has occa sionally been used for literary purposes. De Quincy was well aware of the "inscription" of the past on the present, for he claims that "there is no such thing as ultimate forgetting; traces once im pressed upon the memory are indestructible", and show their heads, especially after a dose of laudanum. Hardy says the same: the present holds the ever-increasing burden of the past "in dateless dure abiding". The physical possibility of the existence of the past in the present was suggested in An Adventure, pub lished in 1901 by "Miss Morrison" and "Miss Lamont," writers who three years ago revealed their identities. Edith Oliver's pre face sets forth the weird experience recounted in the book: "Two women of the twentieth century found themselves walking to gether in the Trianon of 1789, and, there", came "upon figure after figure unaccountably arisen from that unfamiliar past". They visited the Trianon and saw there the plough, the guardsman, the kiosk, the bridge over the cascade, all as it had been one hundred and twelve years before. Can it be proved that the story is a bundle of lies? In his Villanelle of Change Edwin Arlington Robinson tells the same tale:</page><page sequence="16">COUNTERCLOCKWISE 353 Since Persia fell at Marathon The yellow years have gathered fast; Long centuries have come and gone, And yet (they say) the place will don A phantom fury of the past, Since Persia fell at Marathon. Two English ladies have said that they saw such a marvel at the Trianon. Cl?mence Dane uses the notion as a theatrical trick in Come of Age, where Chatterton is the Boy who continues where Chatterton left off. In that way the past may be said to live in the present. To return to the less terrifying, William de Morgan's Joseph Van?e is a book of which Bergson would be proud. For in the mind of the aged Vance, the past lives indelibly; the whole book is "a strong ripple of the Memory pool". There is one writer who has built a complete philosophy around this idea: Marcel Proust. With DeQuincey he would say that the past is never forgotten; it can be fished up on the line of as sociative memories. He applies Bergson's theory throughout, that the past modifies the present, lives in it, makes it grow. The push button of the senses in the present lights up the past. The most famous of his push buttons is of course the madeleine dipped in tea which recalls to kinetic life the days at Combray. A similar push button is the phrase in Vinteuil's sonata that always brings to Swann the glow of Odette. "The past is hidden somewhere out side the realm, beyond the reach of intellect, in some material object (in the sensation which that material object will give us) which we do not suspect." In such a "tiny and almost impalpable drop", "the vast structure of recollection" which is Remembrance of Things Past is induced. He states finally: Memory, by bringing the past into the present unmodified . . . eliminated precisely that great dimension of Time which gave us the fullest realization of our lives. On the moment of waking the past often reveals itself too. Thus these writers cheat the monster time, and make the past live again, bewitched to life by the touch of memory, the taste of cake, the sound of a step. For them the arbitrary divisions of a discontinu ous time are annihilated. They prove themselves masters of the unending tide. Time may change people, so that they no longer</page><page sequence="17">354 by MADELEINE B. STERN resemble their past selves; but at a touch the past is there again, mingled in the seething waves of the present. The subjectivists took still another step forward. If the mind has power to increase and diminish time-lengths; if memory can draw up the past into the present, then time cannot be measured, but can only be considered a flow, a continuous flow in which there are no "discretely flying particles", but in which past, present and future mingle and cannot be divided. This form of the sub jective conception of time also finds a place among the philos ophers. It was in the third century A.D. that Plotinus (who, by the way, was not completely subjective in his attitude) claimed time to be "a continuum in which events happen". The note was re peated when in the seventeenth century Descartes spoke of the continuous movement of time. Recall too that even the absolutist, Newton, wrote of time as "uniformly moving". And even Galileo, with his objective, mathematical time, considered it "a continuum fashioned by the moving present, moving from the past into the future" in a merging flow. Later on, Bradley suggested the con tinuous flow of time by means of an image that was later used with slight variations in Berkeley Square: "Let us fancy ourselves in total darkness, hung over a stream, and looking down on it . . . Right under our faces is a bright illumined spot in the water, which ceaselessly widens and narrows its area and shows us what passes away on the current, and this spot that is light is our now, our present." This spot moves ceaselessly, continuously. At the end of the nineteenth century Alfred H. Lloyd gives a hint of Bergson ian continuity when he says that "Those who live do not live in time; they live time itself"; the lives of most are a continuous movement, and when they change they usually change impercept ibly, so that one state cannot be demarked by a line from the other. Georges Sorel reiterates that idea, and Rageot's words suggest the same phenomenon when he speaks of time as &lt;(une dur?e ou rien ne dure plus, un rhythme sans cadence." He per ceives "duration as a stream against which we cannot go. It is the foundation of our being, and, as we feel, the very substance of the world in which we live"; it is "a ceaseless upspringing of some thing new"; "the continuity of a change that is pure mobility."</page><page sequence="18">COUNTERCLOCKWISE 355 Bergson is less interested in the succession from one period to another, than in the continuous flux between successions. Dur ation is the continuous progress of the past which "gnaws into the future and which swells as it advances." It signifies at the same time "undivided continuity and creation." To Zeno, who was troubled with the impossibility of measuring the discontinuous flight of an arrow from point to point, Bergson would reply that "the arrow never is at any point of its course"; for its movement, and time's movement are not only continued but continuous. Fol lowing Bergson, one philosopher after another indicated his belief in the continuity of time's flow. McGilvary's image is particu larly striking. "Whoever watches a slowly leaking faucet with the drops forming and breaking away gets a typical experience of the continuity of time. The new drops do not come into being all at once; they grow, swelling visibly and lengthening out, they gradu ally thin at the top, and they fall away, each leaving at the in stant of its fall the beginning of a new drop above." The same point of view is suggested by H. A. Overstreet, Alexander, the tem poralists, Phillon, Renouvier and James, whom Lovejoy has in terpreted, Farges and R. W. Sellers. One interesting twist to the theory of time's continuity was suggested in 1927 by J. W. Dunne in his Experiment with Time. Since time is continuous, he declares that he can peer through the veil that hides the future from the present, and catch glimpses of that future in dreams. He records his dreams at the moment of waking, and finds that they "come true" later. Osty's subjects whose dreams are recorded in his Supernormal Faculties in Man have had similar experiences. Since the past, present and future form a continuous river, we may per haps be allowed to visit into the past as those two English ladies did, or glimpse into the future with Dunne. We may also be able to explain, according to Dunne, the phenomenon of "d?j? vue}\ The incident which we are sure has happened before, may have come to us in a dream of the future, forgotten upon waking, but stored in the nethermost layers of our consciousness. Another concept arising from the idea of the continuity of time, may be considered at this point. It is the notion of the "specious present". According to E. R. Clay, originator of the term, and James who used the expression, the present really contains part of the past,</page><page sequence="19">356 by MADELEINE B. STERN and perhaps even hints of the future. Since time flows continu ously, that is the only manner in which any kind of present can be marked off from the past and future. That present, like all the notes of a bar of music, contains part of what went before and a hint of what is to come. V. It will be interesting to see how the idea of time's continuity and the theories arising from it, have been turned to literary ends. Sterne's Shandyism?what is it but an application in literature of the continuous flow of time? He digresses from noses to door hinges to pishes and chamber-maids, to Paris streets and whiskers, through the battle of Steinkirk; and his digressions are not chrono logically successive, but flow forward without a break from one to another as time flows. It was not until the twentieth century, however, that the idea gained a complete literary wardrobe. In 1915 Henry James in his Sense of the Past used the idea of time as a continuously flowing stream. Ralph Pendrel needed no bridges to cross the gap between the present and the past, for there was no gap. He, with his sense of the past, had but to ex change places with the man of 1820 with his sense of the future, to visit those currents in the flood that are always there, waiting for explorers. Eight years later, in Time is a Dream, Lenormand used the same idea when Nico explains : Man walks in Time as in a garden; behind him there goes one spreading a veil so that he may not behold the flowers of the past; before him goes one spreading a veil likewise, so that he may not yet behold the flowers of the future. All these flowers, however, bloom at once behind the two veils and the eyes of the initiate contemplate them continually. Like the Indian initiates, like Dunne and Ralph Pendrel, Rom?e is able to glance into the future through the veil; for "there is neither past nor future, nothing but one vast present." Peter Standish in Balderston's Berkeley Square is but another Ralph Pendrel using Bradley's image to explain the possibility of travel ing back in the continuum of time. Suppose you are in a boat sailing from a winding stream ... You went by a grove of maple trees, upstream. But you can't</page><page sequence="20">COUNTERCLOCKWISE 357 see them now, so you saw them in the past, didn't you? You're watching a field of clover, now; it's before your eyes, in the present, but you don't know yet what's around the bend in the stream there ahead of you; . . . you can't see them until you get around the bend, in the future, can you? . . . Now re member, you're in the boat. But Fm up in the sky above you, in a plane ... I can see, all at once, the trees you saw up stream, the field of clover that you see now, and what's wait ing for you, around the bend ahead! All at once I So the past, present, and future of the man in the boat are all one, to the man in the plane. Doesn't that show how all Time must really be one?" Obviously, since all time is one, and past, present and future are co-existent, continuously flowing, people can travel in time. Wells in his Discovery of the Future saw the possibility of grasping something of the communal future by a little swim ahead to the time that lies waiting beyond us. Maeterlinck in his Unknown Guest saw the same possibility since "the present is at the same time the future and the past." John Lawrence Hodgson in The Time Journey of Dr. Barton explains the Doctor's subjective jump from 1927 to 3927 because of the fact that "the Present must somehow or other contain the Future, just as a looking glass . . . seems to contain the solid contents of the room which it reflects." Ali's crystal in Dunsany's // is the same spur as Hodgson's ma chine used here to return to the past. Dunsany's idea is purpose fully more fantastic, for he wishes to show how John Beal could change that past. The Shandyistic flow of time is indicated in Benson's Life of Edward Fitzgerald when, speaking of Omar, he writes, He was often face to face with the mystery that there is really no such thing as the present; the future beckons at first far off, then near; then even in the swift passage of thought, when a man says of a moment, "It is here," it is numbered with the past. It is that aspect of the continuity of time that interests such a writer as Gertrude Stein. Her preoccupation with time's flow has perhaps caused some of the strange effects she seeks to make. She tells us "There must be time . . . This is the thing that is at present the most troubling and if there is the time that is at</page><page sequence="21">358 by MADELEINE B. STERN present the most troublesome the time-sense that is at present the most troubling is the thing that makes the present the most troubling." Perhaps it is the thing that makes Miss Stein the most troubling too. For in her attempt to capture the continuous flow of time, she omits the marks of punctuation that would stop the flow, and uses repetition to indicate the existence of the past in the present, the lingering of thoughts and words that have al ready been stated, in the present. It is with the "fluid changes" of time that Proust is also oc cupied. Because there are no breaks between past and present, Proust can draw up the past into the present. He mocks the novelists who give us "at the top of one page ... a lover full of hope; at the foot of the next we meet him again, a bowed old man of eighty." Time does cause such changes, but they are not dis continuous; they are ceaseless and imperceptible. Speaking of the past, he writes : "Rien qu'un moment du pass?? Beaucoup plus, peut-?tre; quelque; chose qui commun ? la fois au pass? et au pr?sent, est beaucoup plus essentiel qu'eux deux." William James would call it the "specious present"; Henri Bergson, "evo lution". Thus the madeleine soaked in tea, or a dream at night, can recaU the past or rather can return us to the past in Proust's architecture of recollection. The pernicious current of the years, marking its changes upon human beings, demonstrates "la dis tance et la continuit? du Temps". With Proust, the continuity of time is interesting in itself, and also because of the changes it causes in human beings. With Ger trude Stein it is important because it creates her attitude toward the art of composition itself. In seeking to demonstrate the flow of time, her writing flows, or should flow. A glance at two other important writers of today will perhaps suggest the possibility that the stream of consciousness method is an attempt to express in words the continuity of the passage of time. As time flows, thoughts flow; as thoughts flow, one from the other, words are manipulated to express that passage. In Virginia Woolf's Monday or Tuesday, we find placed within parentheses the events of clock time in the external world. Outside parentheses go the events that stream in the real Bergsonian time of the mind. The same device is used in To the Lighthouse. Without parentheses appear the</page><page sequence="22">COUNTERCLOCKWISE 359 "light persistency of feathers", "mattresses rolled around", "bare boards", "bare legs of tables", "saucepans and china already furred", each image suggesting the other in an associative flow, parallel with the continuous flow of time. Parenthetically arranged are the events that mark a discontinuity in time: Prue's marriage and death, Mr. Carmichael's volume of poems. The technique repeats itself in The Waves. In the continuous flowing of wave on wave, the "speck of sun", the "donkey drawing the mowing ma chine", the "sail that passes between the laurel leaves", are the events of real importance in the associative stream of consciousness that parallels the flow of time, and takes place within it. "On the roof of my [Bernard's] mind time, forming, lets fall its drop", a drop reminiscent of McGilvary's. Her sense of the continuous movement of time is the element which makes for Virginia Woolf's stream of consciousness. When Wyndham Lewis states that he regards Ulysses as a "time-book", perhaps he means that Joyce's preoccupation with time as continuous has led him to use the particular style he does to make clear its flow. "Time ever passing" without, breaks or pauses between instants, makes Stephen's associative memory possible, makes the whole stream of consciousness technique pos sible. And because there can be no sudden break in time, it takes 768 pages to record the lives of two men in Dublin for twenty hours on June 16, 1904. Continually exercising his associative memory in the flow of time, Stephen gets up, teaches, is paid, walks along the beach, discusses Hamlet in a newspaper office and appears in the night town scene. From Stephen's rising to Mrs. Bloom's erotic effusions the book is a stream of words suggesting the cease less, continuous flow of the mind in a steady, unbroken time dimension. VI. So much then for the subjectivists who contract and expand time, who draw up the past into the present, who flow in it as in a continuum. Writers use these philosophic theories to convey us backward and forward in time on mechanistic contraptions, as a theatrical trick or as an impetus to a profound conception of art. Then something happened that let their fancies loose to fly, couched</page><page sequence="23">360 by MADELEINE B. STERN in the arms of science, above and beneath and around time: The Theory of Relativity. It is neither the purpose nor the power of the writer to discuss such elements in mathematical theory as a symmetrical and transitive time, dislocation of simultaneity, or contraction of length. Let Mr. Gunn, so expert an interpreter of the philosophical theories of time, explain for us. It would seem that at the basis of the theory of relativity is the belief that "certain events which on one system are simultaneous, in another are reck oned as successive, and vice versa, so that local or multiple times are set up. This occurs if one system be absolutely at rest and all the other systems are in motion relative to it." In other words, when two or more individuals are concerned, the time varies rel atively to the movements of each. This differs from subjective time in that it posits a time that is mathematical and objective, and re quires more than one person, whereas subjective time differs rel atively within one individual's state of mind. It occasionally overlaps the subjective notion, because it may be said that time differs not only according to the physical movements of human beings, but according to the movements within their minds. This theory was hinted at in literature before the philosophers took hold of it. Recall Shakespeare's time that ambled with the priest who lacked Latin and trotted with the maid before her marriage was solemnized, and galloped with the thief to the gal lows. According to the dispositions of each of these people, time varies. It does not merely amble and trot inside the mind of one person as it would subjectively; but, granted more than one person, it varies relative to the mental movements of each. Voltaire's riddle, though postulating the subjectivity of time, also suggests its relativity, since he considers different times in the minds of many people. Poe's Three Sundays in a Week approaches more closely the relativist viewpoint. In that story Smitherton, who travelled for one year around the world going East, thinks yester day Sunday; Pratt who travelled the same distance in the "same" time, going West, thinks tomorrow Sunday; Kate who stayed in the same place for a year thinks today Sunday. Thus time differs according to the movements of those who wear watches. Fannye N. Cherry in her study of the sources of that story, compares it with another tale that appeared in the same year, 1841, Three</page><page sequence="24">COUNTERCLOCKWISE 361 Thursdays in a Week. Jules Verne points out the differences in time on the moon where a night lasts for 354K hours and on the earth, in his From the Earth to the Moon. In 1910 Ezra Pound reminded us that "it is dawn at Jerusalem while midnight hovers about the pillars of Hercules". More recently Maeterlinck made the existence of a plurality of times very real when he wrote of the astronomer on the star Mira who would see, had he a suf ficiently powerful telescope, our past as his present; and who could in turn foretell to a more distant star, a star to which this would be the future, our past. Again, in Come of Age Cl?mence Dane shows us that what to a mortal boy is one hour, to Death is a century. Time differs then according to the mental or physical movements of different people. The writer of the following limerick knew even more technicalities about the relativity of time when he wrote : There was a young lady of Bright Whose speed it was faster than light; She eloped one day In a relative way, And returned on the previous night. She and Poe's Pratt may have taken their honeymoon together. While these writers were hinting at the idea of relativity, the notion had been gaining philosophical expression. As early as 1619 Descartes had raised "the problems of the relativity of move ment". Remember that Spencer had suggested that time was a "relative reality". And Condillac transferred the problem from subjectivity in the mind of one man to relativity in the minds of two: "La notion de la dur?e est donc toute relative; chacun n'en juge que par la succession de ses id?es; et vraisemblablement il n'y a pas deux hommes qui, dans un temps abonn? comptent un ?gal nombre d'instants." Later on, "Sigwart, Mach, and Poincar? led up to Einstein and the anti-Newtonian conceptions of the present day". Poincar? even went so far as to distinguish, as the present writer does not distinguish, between physical and psychological relativity. Einstein then definitely stated that "every . . . time measurement ... is dependent on and changes with the position of the observer, so that the last vestige of the absolute vanishes from whatever comes into the realm of observation". After Ein stein, numerous philosophers (among them Richard T. Cox) iden</page><page sequence="25">362 by MADELEINE B. STERN tified themselves with this theory. Robb and Schlick wrote par ticularly on the subject. Schlick distinguishes between the old special theory of relativity with which we are concerned, and which states that the "description of an event . . . will vary according to the relative motion of the observer" and the more recent general theory which has not yet found its literary expression. Thus the theory has developed, at times being anticipated in literature, finally molded into definite shape by the philosophers and again used for various purposes in drama, verse and fiction. One aspect of the theory has in particular been used by creative artists: the theory of the fourth dimension, Space-Time. "The Theory of Relativity is obliged to posit a Space-Time continuum of four dimensions": length, width, breadth, and space-time. As early as 1754 a friend suggested to D'Alembert the possibility of time as a fourth dimension. Lange, Lagrange and Fechner dealt with the subject at an early period. More recently Smuts devoted some study to the "Space-Time medium of the real physical world". Henri Poincar? and Edwin B. Holt are both adherents of the theory. As Wyndham Lewis puts it, Space-Time is the einstein ian god. Alfred A. Robb expresses it thus : "The theory of space is really a part of the theory of time". To Bertrand Russell "far the most important thing about the theory of relativity is the abolition of the one cosmic time and the one persistent space, and the substitution of space-time in place of both". Professor Alex ander is an unflinching disciple of Einstein in his treatment of the fourth dimension; to him "Time is the mind of Space, and Space the body of Time". Whitehead, Millikan, and Eddington are all exponents of the theory that there are four dimensions, of which time is the fourth. In literature this idea has been used mainly in the so-called scientific romance. There is one poem, however, which treats the idea with all the respect that the philosophers could wish, Hardy's The Absolute Explains, which ends : So thus doth Being's length transcend Time's ancient regal claim To see all lengths begin and end. 'The Fourth Dimension' fame Bruits as its name. There are five writers who have employed the idea to popularize</page><page sequence="26">COUNTERCLOCKWISE 363 science and at the same time give the reader the thrill of adven ture. In 1910 Charles H. Hinton applied in his scientific romances the theory of the fourth dimension. His book, What is the Fourth Dimension? recalls Abbott's Flatland which is a kind of primer in relativity, conveying the reader from one dimension to the next, until he is expected to be able to understand the most difficult, the fourth. In The Time Machine H. G. Wells uses the idea that "Time's only a kind of Space" to make his philosophical inventor able to travel in time. The latter explains, Any real body must have extension in four directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and?Duration . . . There are really four dimensions, three which we call the three pianes of Space, and a fourth, Time. In the same year, 1912, Pawlowski wrote his Voyage au pays de la quatri?me dimension. The land of the fourth dimension is full of marvels. There "l'?me silencieuse . . . ne s'inqui?te plus des bruits du monde"; the land has horizontal ladders and knots that won't stay knotted. Seven years ago, we recall, John L. Hodgson wrote his Time-Journey of Dr. Barton which contains many of the theories of the philosophers, and in which also appears the Well sian notion that Dr. Barton travels in Space-Time. The fourth dimension had indeed the magic of the philosopher's stone. It is an excellent hiding place for ghosts. Length, breadth and width lodge in the fourth dimension, time; so may dragons and spectres and the shades of our ancestors. It can also be recommended as an efficacious bogey-man to bring naughty children back to their senses. But there have been and there are some who cannot see any joke at ah in the ceaseless flow of time, its subjectivity, its relativity. They shake their heads when they hear about Moszkowski's twins, one of whom "rushes into space at an enormous rate, describing ... a circle", and returns to find his less mobile brother some forty five years older than he. Nor can they understand the story of Eddington's two cigars. An aviator traveling at 161,000 miles an hour lights a cigar at the same time we do. He thinks our cigar lasts twice as long as his; and we think the same of his cigar. But long before such abstruse problems as these had been dis cussed, writers dropped the question of time as incomprehensible.</page><page sequence="27">364 by MADELEINE B. STERN Spencer, after many attempts at arriving at a decision, concluded that "space and time are wholly incomprehensible". More recently Charles Nordmann noted that "as the identity of time becomes more nebulous, its measurement becomes more exact". There were writers too, who, for all their ponderings, could but conclude that "on the mysterious foundations of things our an chors slide along and fail to bite." It was Augustine who said "Quid est tempus? Si nemo ex me quearat, sei; si quaerenti ex plicare velim, nescio." And remember Cicero's "Difficile est tempus definir?". In the seventeenth century A. W. wrote To Time, "I lose thee while I seek to find thee out". And even Christina Rossetti, who sometimes knew how to manage time, was compelled to write, How many ages in time? No one knows the rhyme. It was also Maeterlinck's conclusion that "the most discouraging fact is that time has no fixed and actual point on which we can fasten". Eight years before, he had anticipated this conclusion in The Unknown Guest: "We discover with uneasiness that time, on which we based our whole existence, itself no longer exists". In Barrington Gates' play, Time, Mary cries in anguish: "What is slow?and what is fast?and what is the right time?" VII. The question is, of course, rhetorical. We cannot define time. The more definitions that are proposed, the more agile is time to slip away from our very fingers. Time is as elusive as the arrow on the second hand of a watch to which we can never point and say "It is here". What is it that flies without wings, that floats with out a river-bed, that pushes forward and backward, and yet has no hands? Not everybody, however, has reacted quite so mourn fully to time's incomprehensibility. Time is an easy word to use; a delightful thing with which to play tricks. Ideas about time have become so current that they are circulating even now in the minds of those who saw the motion picture, Turn Back the Clock, or heard Alexander Woolcott's radio talk on Sunday, November 18, 1934, in which he used time's continuity as a trick to carry his listeners back to 1909.</page><page sequence="28">COUNTERCLOCKWISE 365 Nor are notions about time merely popular. They are so cur rent that they have already been refuted. Farges chooses to re main on mortal soil with the "vulgar notion" of time which con forms to everyman's experience. Even McGilvary concludes that "our time is relief and regret" rather than scientific timelessness. We may smile with May Sinclair who, writing of space and time, says, For all our conception of their unity, it is as if a man should turn his trousers inside out and marvel at the miracle of their fitting him, or divide them back from front and either declare triumphantly that he has now two trousers, or else complain of the solution of continuity. And Wyndham Lewis has finally rejected the exalting of time over space, when he attacks "the fat and flabby heart of this phi losophy". The ideas have been cogitated, mourned over, laughed at, re jected by some. At least in some instances they have made for some very good writing. Let us then commons ens ically recall that "time, which the physicist Einstein has shown to be relative, has an absolute value for him when measured in hours, and whoever seeks to persuade him to read thick volumes is not likely to gain his goodwill." If Einstein can glance at a watch, and because of the warning on its face close his books, then we too can raise our eyes to the clock and comfortably assure ourselves that we have no more time.</page></plain_text>
