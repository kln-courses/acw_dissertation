<plain_text><page sequence="1">A SHELL MASK GORGET FROM ALLAMAKEE COUNTY, IOWA James M. Collins ABSTRACT Around 1945, a small anthropomorphic masquette made from marine shell (Busycon sp.) was recovered from a protohistoric Oneota grave along a road-cut in northeast Iowa. The primary context and subsequent history of the object are identified. The artifact is described and its significance is briefly discussed from a regional perspective. A hypothesis is presented connecting such masks with intergroup alliance building and the calumet ceremony. Keywords: Calumet Ceremony; Oneota; Chiwere; Dhegiha INTRODUCTION As a boy growing up along the Upper Iowa River, Dale R. Henning developed an interest in Oneota culture that has continued to dominate his professional career. His close friendship with neighbors such as Henry Field, Warren Hayes, and Ellison Orr often took him on forays that inti mately acquainted him with the character (and characters) of local archaeology. It was during one such sortie that the object of current interest was recovered (Fig. 1). At the time?about 1945?Henning would have been in seventh or eighth grade. Conse quently, his current recollection of the event is not sharp (Dale R. Henning, personal communication, 1993). An exact provenience for the artifact is not available, but it is known to have been recovered from a road-cut along route A26 in Allamakee County, Iowa. Route A26 follows the north bank of the Upper Iowa River for roughly 20 km, ending at the juncture of the Upper Iowa valley and the Mississippi River valley at New Albin, Iowa. The road passes numerous Orr phase Oneota habitation sites along the way (Wedel 1959). Henning's recollection of the find was clearer in the late 1950s, when he related the incident to a colleague at the University of Missouri. Robert T. Bray (1963:35), in discussing Southern Cult mo tifs from the Utz site, cited personal communica tion from Henning as follows: Mr. Dale Henning, about the year 1950, excavated a mask gorget associated with the burials of two adults and one child, in Allamakee county, Iowa (Henning, personal communication). The gorget was with the child skeleton and was apparently strung on a necklace with rolled tubular copper and plain glass traders' beads. These are identified with Orr Focus Oneota. Henning (personal communication, 1994), however, is now quite sure that the actual date would have been closer to 1945 and the metal artifact was probably brass. The interments were among many that were exposed by road widening along A26 in the 1940s. According to Ellison Orr's field notes, exposure of burials due to erosion along road-cuts was not unusual in the county during the first half of the twentieth century. For example, a similar find along Iowa 26 near the mouth of the Upper Iowa River was reported by Orr in 1942 (Collins 1993:10; Orr 1942:16). At any rate, we can be sure that Henning was direcdy involved with the recovery of the shell mask gorget, and it can be accepted as fact that its James M.

While it is unfortunate that the exact provenience of the site is not known, it is certain that it was located along the north bank of the Upper Iowa River, within 20 km of the Mississippi River valley (Fig. 2). It should probably be noted that approximate provenience is typical for this genre of artifact (Smith and Smith 1989:14). The associated skeletal material was collected by Henry Field. Field eventually donated portions of his skeletal sample to the State University of Iowa Archaeological Laboratory in the early 1960s, and the rest to Luther College. In the mid 1980s, osteological elements from Field's collec tion at Luther College were turned over to the Office of the State Archaeologist of Iowa (OSA). Human skeletal remains disinterred by Field, pre sumably including the individuals pertinent to this discussion, have been analyzed and reburied in accordance with Iowa Law (Shirley Schermer, personal communication, 1994). Based on the evi dence at hand, it has been impossible to make a definitive connection between the gorget and any of the individuals represented in Field's sample. Ironically, the curatorial history of the shell artifact is also shrouded in uncertainty. Upon en tering graduate school in 1955, Henning realized the significance of his boyhood collection, includ ing the shell mask gorget, and donated it along with a catalog (now lost) to The University of Iowa. Apparently some of the collection was thrown away in the early 1960s by administrative caretakers who were under the mistaken impres sion that the material was ' Take.'' The mask, sans Henning's provenience tag, eventually found its way into a cabinet at the OSA, a research unit of The University of Iowa. There it reposed, along with other unprovenienced specimens, until the late 1980s, when a decision was made to include the artifact in a portable teaching collection put together by the OSA. At the time, personnel at the OSA had not a clue where the mask was from, how it was obtained, or whether it was legitimate or fake. By a stroke of serendipity, the artifact was included with some other specimens in a loan to The University of Iowa Library to be displayed as part of an exhibit and program on Native Ameri cans sponsored by the library in the spring of 1991. Henning presented a lecture on Oneota culture as part of the library's program. During the reception that followed the lecture, he noticed the mask gorget in the exhibit and made the remark: ' 'There's an old friend!'' He then related the story behind the piece, and the artifact regained its sig nificance as a specimen of legitimate cultural in quiry. DESCRIPTION The nomenclature of Phillips and Brown (1978:Figure 8) for the physical features of the whelk shell and the terminology of Smith and Smith (1989) for the artistic attributes allow the following description of the mask gorget. The artifact blank was cut from the body whori of a Lightning Whelk {Busycon contrar ium). Positive identification of the specimen was made by Brian Glenister using the Amoco Produc 252</page><page sequence="3">James M.

The current and fossil distribution of the Lightning Whelk (Abbott and Dance 1982:176) is restricted to the Atlantic coast of North America between South Carolina and the Florida Keys. The artifact measures 64 mm longitudinally; latitudinally it is 59 mm at the eyes, narrowing to 34 mm at the chin. Maximum thickness is 7 mm and occurs in a line through the cross-section of the nose. The overall form of the artifact is some thing of a hybrid between the square-jawed and the stepped-edge shapes described by Smith and Smith (1989:10). The face appears on the dorsal (exterior) sur face. The round eye apertures were drilled, meas uring 3 mm in diameter on the exterior and 5 mm in diameter on the interior. Drilling from the inside surface is indicated. A double-pronged, forked eye surround is engraved below the left eye. Indis tinct hachures above the right eye may have been intended to represent a braided forelock. The cir cumference of the left eye is heavily polished from wear that can only be attributed to a suspension string indicating unquestionable use of the artifact as a gorget. The straight nose is executed in relief by engraved lines below and to its left. The nose exhibits 1-2 mm of relief and is 28 mm in length. No mouth treatment is apparent, but the mouth area is distinctly discolored by a greenish-yellow staia It is assumed that this stain is a result of close contact with the rolled brass tubes reportedly re covered in association with the gorget. The artifact exhibits both beard and hair deco ration executed by notching around the chin and the top of the mask. Additionally, the left edge of the mask appears to have been intentionally sculpted to expose growth lines, contributing to 253</page><page sequence="4">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 40, No. 153,1995 the illusion of long hair falling to the left side of the head. The aforementioned step-edge shape on that side of the artifact may be a convention to further enhance this notion. Smith and Smith (1989:11-14) suggest that beard decoration on shell masks is a widespread trait, but hair decora tion has not heretofore been reported from masks found west of the Mississippi River. The artifact's ventral surface is highly pol ished and displays a patina, possibly resulting from having been rubbed against skin or clothing while worn. This surface also exhibits numerous haphazard scratch marks forming no discernible pattern. These scratches may or may not have been intentionally executed. A CALUMET CONNECTION? The protohistoric period shell masks, such as the one reported here, are distinct in style from the Long or Short Nose God masquettes of the earlier Mississippian period (Hall 1991; Williams and Goggin 1956). However, a continuity from one form to the other through time, incorporating later accoutrements of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, such as the forked-eye surround, seems likely. For instance, Hall (1991:31) has demon strated ...the relationship of the Long Nose God masquettes/earrings to the Winnebago and Ioway mythological hero or demi-god best known as Red Horn or He Who Wears Human Heads as Earrings (Radin 1948; Skinner 1925:456-58). This corre spondence conveniently ties a pre-Oneota symbol into the mythology of two tribes believed at the time of historical contact to have been carriers of the Oneota archaeological culture. Hall makes a convincing argument connect ing the Long Nose God to a ritual drama involving the legend of Red Horn or He Who Wears Human Heads as Earrings. The drama "was part of an adoption ceremony used to provide a ceremonial relationship between the participants through a fiction of kinship, and [...] the ceremony was spe cifically used to establish friendly relations be tween otherwise unrelated groups" (Hall 1991:31). Hall links this legend with the historic calumet ceremony which was "principally an adoption rite to create fictions of blood relation ships, useful in cementing intertribal relations, and adoption was conceived as rebirth" (Hall 1991:31). In Hall's (1991:31) view, The principal difference of the ceremonies proposed as mechanisms of the Cahokia and Oneota interactions is that the former would pre sumably have been performed upon the initiative of the leader (Sun? Thunder Chief?) of the Ca hokia chiefdom to establish formal relationships with regional leaders, and the latter was probably performed, as in historic times, upon the personal initiative of local leaders to relate themselves to other local leaders at a more egalitarian level, not within a regional hierarchy. Elsewhere, Hall (1977) clearly argues the case for viewing the calumet (pipestem) itself as a ritual weapon, and for assuming an even greater time depth for its symbolic origin. Historically, throughout the Midwest and Plains, the calumet ceremony and the closely related Hako rite were instrumental in promoting social interaction and commerce (Blakeslee 1975, 1981; Hall 1977). Mildred Mott Wedel has defined the connec tion between the protohistoric Oneota Orr phase and the historic Ioway tribe through the direct historical approach (Mott 1938; Wedel 1959, 1981, 1986). She (1986:43) relates that the calu met ceremony was an important ritual among the Ioway and was practiced in early contact times by many other Siouan groups, both Dhegiha and Chiwere Siouan speakers and the Dakota Sioux. The Dance of the Calumet ...was normally arranged by a man who sought to honor another within his own tribe, or more often, a neighboring one, and by ritual adoption of a child of the one honored to strengthen bonds between the two families or tribes involved. By setting up a new kinship pattern, obligations that were re quired of relatives were assumed between the two participating parties. This behavior assured peace ful interrelationships and functioned for the mu tual welfare of all. A strong economic element characterized this ceremony in that the donor of the sacred calu mets), together with friends, gave gifts to the man honored, who then responded in like fashion. At the end of a three or four-day ceremony which portrayed the capture, adoption, and return of the child, the two sacred calumets or stems, which had been made by holy men (medicine men) of the tribe and symbolically decorated with colorful bird feathers and other objects, were presented to the adopted child as a symbol of the new relation ship (Wedel 1986:43; emphasis added). 254</page><page sequence="5">James M. Collins Shell Mask Gorget from Iowa In a study of shell masks of a style similar to the one reported here, Smith and Smith (1989) relate that all of the masks in their sample were recovered from primary context with the burials of adult males or children. Smith and Smith (1989:14-16) offer several possible interpretations for the shell masks in their sample. These ideas include their possible use as "death masks," that they symbolized the role of "war captain" in aboriginal societies, and that they functioned as "small portable, symbolic trophy heads," pre sumably symbolizing the killing of a warrior in battle. They also recount Brown's (1985) interpre tation of the weeping eye iconographic motif as it relates to the Thunderbird concept. As such, the masks are again viewed as war symbols, and the symbolism of seeking supernatural aid in war is the interpretation of the artifacts preferred by Smith and Smith (1989:16). To account for the frequent occurrence of the masks with child buri als, an interpretation of the masks as having con nections to a Cherokee myth "in which the Thunder Boys were called on to provide wild game" is related. In this interpretation, the masks would represent "Thunder Boy gorgets," and "may have functioned as hunting charms" (Smith and Smith 1989:16). For the specimen reported above and other outliers from the prairie/plains border and beyond (i.e., from the Northern Plains), the interpretation of the objects as "Thunderers," specifically war symbols, is here preferred. Used as such, the masks would not be out of place in situations analogous to the ceremonial function of other ac coutrements associated with the historic calumet ceremony. While the calumet ceremony was es sentially an adoption ritual and mechanism for peaceful interaction between discrete groups, ele ments correlative of war and aggression also char acterized the rite. Hall's (1977) interpretation of the calumet itself as a ritual weapon was men tioned above. Among most tribes, acceptance by the adopted person of his new' 'family's'' warfare responsibilities was an explicit component of the adoption ceremony. Among the Osage for in stance, Fletcher and La Flesche (1911:62) reported that during the adoption ceremony: ...the captive [adoptee] symbolically traversed the tribal circle, passing from those on the north, who make peace, to those on the south, who had charge of war?the act indicating that he was to share in all that concerned the tribe. Then the chief of the Ingron ga [warriors] took a sharp-pointed flint knife and made a quick stroke on the end of the captive's nose, causing the blood to flow. The chief of the Tsi'zhu washtage [peace makers] wiped away the blood....Then the chief of the Wa'tsetsi brought water, and the chief of the Honga food (corn and meat), and these were ad ministered to the captive by the chief ofthe Tsi'zhu washtage, who then took the sacred pipe, filled it, and placed on it fronds of cedar brought by the I'batse. The pipe was lit and ceremonially smoked by the captive. Then the chief of the Nu'xe brought buffalo fat and anointed the body of the captive, after which the chief of the O'pxo11 painted two black stripes across the face from the left eyebrow to the lower part of the right cheek. This done, the chief of the Tsi'zhu washtage announced the name, Ni'wathe ("made to live"), and the captive became the child of the man who adopted him. The letting of the blood symbolized that the captive lost the blood and kinship of the tribe into which he had been born. All trace of his former birth was removed by the washing away of the blood by the Wa'tsetsi. He was then given food by those who led the tribe in the hunt when the food supply was obtained. The new blood made by the Osage food was thus made Osage blood. This symbolic act was confirmed and sancti fied by the smoking of the pipe, the aromatic cedar being provided by the I'batse. Finally, the anoint ing of the body by the Nu'xe (who, together with the Buffalo people, controlled the planting of the com) brought the captive entirely within the rites and avocations of the tribe. The black stripes put on by the O'pxo" were in recognition of the Thun der as the god of war and the captive's future duties as a warrior of the tribe. War and peace are intimately related phenom ena, and it should not be unexpected that both pipes and masks may have functioned as instru ments in the ceremonies related to conflict and conflict avoidance among aboriginal societies. Al though no ethnohistorical accounts that specifi cally link shell masquettes with adoption ceremonies have been encountered, symbolic rep resentation of the Thunderer (war god) at such ceremonies is common, as in the account related above. It would seem that icons (masks) represen tative of the Thunderer might also be naturally expected as at least occasional accoutrements re 255</page><page sequence="6">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 40, No. 153,1995 lating to such rituals. A possible functional Unk between the shell masks and the calumet pipe is represented by the Futaba Pipe Mask recovered from the Utz site in Missouri and reported by Bray (1963:8, Figure 4). This engraved pipe, as well as a number of cadinite tablets also recovered from Utz, bear fork-eyed anthropomorphic representations very similar in design to the masks in question. The Utz site, a protohistoric Oneota and historic Missouri Indian town, has also yielded a shell mask gorget of the type reported here (Chapman 1980:239). A relationship between pipes and mask gor gets is also suggested by the contents of a Kansa war bundle collected on the Northern Plains in the nineteenth century (see Dorsey 1885; Howard 1956; Skinner 1915; Smith and Smith 1989). Based on information supplied by Dorsey (1885), Howard (1956:302) relates that [contained in the same bundle with the gorget was a pipe....This pipe is of the disc type, a form often recovered in Oneota sites. Some interesting notes on the treatment accorded the pipe and gorget by the Kansa are found in Dorsey's paper (p. 674). As quoted by Howard (1956:302), Dorsey (1885:674) stated that: When the sacred pipe is smoked by a...man, he must hold it in his right hand, blowing the smoke into the clam shell, which is in the left. The smoke is supposed to ascend to the thunder god, a god of war, to whom it is pleasant. In the works of Hall (1977, 1983, 1991) we find plausible evidence for the prehistoric origin of the calumet ceremony. Blakeslee (1975, 1981) has also marshaled data suggestive of a prehistoric origin of the rite, used most prominently to open avenues of material exchange and to develop alli ances for warlike purposes. Regardless of how deep into prehistory the ceremony can be traced, there is general consensus that its protohistoric and historic diffusion was from the Plains to the east and southeast (Blakeslee 1981; Brown 1989). A DHEGIHAN CONNECTION? The distribution of the shell mask gorgets is extremely interesting (Smith and Smith 1989fig ure 2). The majority of reported specimens cluster in somewhat circumscribed areas along the upper Tennessee valley, the upper Ohio valley, and in the central Mississippi valley (Fig. 3). Northwestern outliers are currently reported from the Utz site in central Missouri, from a protohistoric Ioway child's grave along the Upper Iowa River in north eastern Iowa, from a historic period Kansa war bundle, from the Demeiy site in South Dakota (Woolworth and Wood 1964), and from Long Lake Creek and the Heimdal Mound (Howard 1953) in North Dakota. There are other specimens from the Plains that have not yet been reported, and there may be some that have been reported of which this author is not aware. There has been much recent speculation about how and when the Dhegihan tribes (Quapaw, Osage, Kansa, Omaha, and Ponca) became estab lished in the west (Henning 1993; Hoffman 1990; Johnson 1991; Logan and Hedden 1993; Vehik 1993). Both Henning and Vehik lean toward the view that common Dhegihan tribal migration leg ends are correct. These legends hold that various Dhegihan tribal units separated relatively recently from a common ancestral group, eventually mi grating to the Plains, initially from the Ohio valley, and more recently (as late as the seventeenth cen tury) from the central Mississippi valley near the mouth of the Arkansas. In this regard, it is note worthy that the calumet ceremony was apparently well established among the Quapaw living in Ar kansas during the seventeenth century (Brown 1989:314). Critics of the recent migration hy pothesis cite the lack of similarities between the material culture of the Plains Dhegihans and po tential ancestral populations in the east, despite a plethora of Dhegihan legends and linguistic, eth nohistoric, and historic information that tends to support such an interpretation. As Henning (1993:261) put it: The shared prehistoric technological tradition of the Dhegihan speaking tribes is, at the present state of the discipline of anthropology, lost. Yet we know, if only from the presence of five important and closely related tribes in the early contact pe riod, that a shared Dhegihan technological tradi tion must once have existed. Because of the shared migration legend, we suspect that some manifes tation in the Ohio River valley might be what we are looking for. The Dhegihan people themselves are responsible for our inability to trace them to their homeland, if only because they share a pat tern of tenaciously retaining their language, leg 256</page><page sequence="7">James M.

Map showing locations of the Upper Iowa River, the Utz site, and areas of the eastern United States where shell mask gorgets are relatively common. ends, and social and religious traditions while readily adapting to new subsistence patterns and technologies. Based on the evidence at hand, it appears that Dhegihan speaking tribes and shell mask "Thun der" gorgets arrived simultaneously in the Mis souri River drainage during the protohistoric period. Excepting the major concentration along the Tennessee River, and some other eastern out liers (such as specimens found along the Poto mac), the distribution of shell mask gorgets seems to coincide closely with the proposed migration of Dhegihan groups?first from the Ohio valley, then to the central Mississippi valley, and then on to the Missouri and its tributaries. Upon arriving on the prairie/plains border, the Dhegihan speaking tribes took up residence in close proximity to the already well established Chiwere Siouan tribes (Ioway, Oto, and Missouri). The Chiwere groups, deriving from the pre historic Oneota, very likely performed the calumet ceremony during the earliest protohistoric period. It seems not too far a stretch to speculate that Dhegihan groups may have adopted the calumet from their Chiwere neighbors as readily as they did the local patterns of technology and subsistence. As shown by the Osage example presented above, shell mask "Thunder" icons might have been easily incorporated into the calumet adoption rit ual. If such were the case, it might be expected that the artifacts would show up as they have on the prairie/plains border, that is: from archaeological 257</page><page sequence="8">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 40, No. 153,1995 or ethnohistoric contexts associated with Dhegi han speakers (e.g., the Kansa war bundle); in the sites of their Chiwere neighbors and potential sponsors (e.g., the Missouri and Ioway); and in cultural tension zones or strategic buffer areas, such as in the Demery example (Lehmer 1971:127), where performance of the calumet might be useful to ameliorate intergroup tension. What is proposed, in short, is that the Dhegihan groups may have been instrumental in introducing the shell mask genre to the Plains. The calumet ceremony would seem a logical conduit for trans fer of such items to indigenous populations such as the neighboring Missouri, Ioway, and Oto. As for how Dhegihan groups in the Ohio valley may have originally come to use shell mask 6 'Thunder'' icons, it is assumed that they received them from neighboring Muskhogean groups or through intermediaries. From the historical record (Swanton 1946), it is clear that numerous tribes habitually migrated back and forth between the Ohio River and Tennessee River watersheds (e.g., the Shawnee, the Tuscarora). Concerning poten tial early Dhegihan migrations or contacts in that region, however, suffice here to recall a statement by Griffin (1966:313): "[t]he confusion of theo ries mentioned above results from the fact that no one is in position to interpret intelligentiy the prehistory of the area in terms of tribal migra tions." Can shell masquettes be considered one ex ample of Dhegihan material culture that can be traced to the purported Dhegihan ancestral home lands? If so, the occurrence of the masks among the burial effects of Oneota/Chiwere-related Prai rie Peninsula groups, as well as elsewhere on the Northern Plains, might then be explained by sug gesting that the masks represent symbols used in situations analogous to gift giving. As historically documented for calumet ceremonies among the Ioway and numerous other tribes, such ritual gift giving served to establish formal, favorable rela tionships, based on fictive kinship ties, with the external populations. Such a scenario, admittedly speculative and based on a somewhat tenuous line of circumstantial evidence, nevertheless enables us to consider these artifacts as having played an essential role in the adaptive patterning of the Dhegihan-speaking tribes on the western prairies. CONCLUSIONS Shell mask gorgets like the one reported here may have served an analogous ceremonial func tion as proposed by Hall for the early Oneota Long Nose God, and as documented ethnohistorically by Wedel for other accoutrements associated with the Ioway calumets. If this premise is accepted, it is not surprising that the Allamakee County mask was found interred with a subadult. It is proposed simply that the ornament became the property of the principal player involved with the adoption ritual of the calumet ceremony. This individual would have kept the material accoutrements of the ceremony, including the mask, as objects of per sonal distinction until his death. Such an interpre tation may help to account for the confusing occurrence of these masks in the graves of both adults and children noted elsewhere. Some adop tion ceremony participants would have lived to maturity, others would have died young. Regard less of age, it appears many brought the gorgets to their graves as personal effects. This interpretation does not preclude the possible use of these artifacts in ways exclusive of the calumet ceremony. It merely represents an attempt to explain the occur rence of such an unusual artifact in local and regional context. It is speculated that the Allamakee County shell mask gorget was presented to an Orr phase Oneota/Ioway child as the result of participation in a calumet ceremony that created a fictive kin ship between members of his group and those of an external group. Past and future finds of such artifacts on the Plains may or may not be viewed profitably in the context of this hypothesis.
