<plain_text><page sequence="1">BARUCH SPINOZA AND WESTERN DEMOCRACr. An Inter- pretation of His Philosophical, Religious and Political Thought. By JOSEPH DUNNER. New York, Philosophical Library, I955. Pp. xiii, I42. $3.00. Every student of Spinoza, from the merest beginner to the most learned scholar, knows only too well that he is extremely difficult both to understand and to expound. As a consequence, most of the books on Spinoza are also difficult, and Spinoza, therefore, although now high in prestige, is probably less widely read than his reputation would indicate. For this reason one may welcome Professor Dunner's book, which is obviously designed for the general reader rather than the scholar and which undertakes to rouse interest in Spinoza by indicating not only his importance in the establishment of Western democracy but also his relevance to the critical problems which the democracies face today. Dunner tries so far as possible to avoid technical language, and his enthusiasm for his subject is apparent on every page. The book is divided into five chapters, the first of which deals with Spinoza's life. Dunner follows Colerus, for the most part, although he recognizes his probable unreliability. The reader's attention is inter- rupted from time to time by side remarks, such as the reference to the Gospel according to St. Matthew on page 2 ("appears to be unhistorical and written to please the rulers of the Roman empire"), or to Columbus on page 5 ("probably himself a Marrano"). The sketch also calls for an account of some of Spinoza's early writings, with extensive quotations. The elucidation here is somewhat unclear. For example, on page i6, 281</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS in explaining Spinoza's rejection of Baconian induction, Dunner writes: "To Spinoza, the surer way of attaining truth appeared to be what he called 'clear ideas,' some fundamental hypotheses which, if borne out by logical reasoning, would lead to further postulates." This sentence certainly rides roughshod over the notion of "clear ideas," which is so essential to seventeenth-century rationalism. The second chapter, on Spinoza's metaphysics, is necessarily brief. Unfortunately, Dunner has chosen to be polemical rather than philo- sophical in building up his hero. Both Rousseau and Leibnitz (whose "nomads" are referred to on page 40) are accused of plagiarism. Descartes, to whom various doctrines are incorrectly assigned, is dismissed as an apologist for the Church (p. 38). Hobbes, Locke, Hume are all dismissed very lightly. And we read: "If only the theologians could have freed themselves from all anthropomorphic and anthropo- centric fixations, making of God a sort of super-man throned in the sky, they might have realized that Spinoza had given world humanity the most rational and most unfailing God concept ever conceived in history" (p. 40). On the positive side, Dunner abbreviates many of Spinoza's central arguments, but abbreviation here leads neither to clarity nor to conviction. For example, when he writes on page 43, "Humnan mind and human body are intertwined," he really is doing grave violence to a difficult but essential concept. It is also a little surprising that Spinoza, in rejecting common-sense experience as the sole valid source of knowledge, has achieved "the first real insight into semantics" (P. 44). With the last three chapters, "Spinoza's Concept of God," "Spinoza's Political Thought," and "Spinoza's Legacy for the Twentieth Cen- tury," Dunner arrives at the points which he is most eager to establish. As the title of the book suggests, he is most interested in the political aspects of Spinoza's thought, for he finds this of primary importance in Spinoza. While the great Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius . . . developed the modern prin- ciples of international law, it was Spinoza, who, aiming to secure freedom of thought and of expression for all the members of the state, established the doctrines of the common or general will of the people, of human equality, and of popular sovereignty. Had he lived longer, it would have become quite clear that Spinoza's major interest was not at all in metaphysics, but rather in the development of a modern political science [p. go]. Dunner, with the aid of more lengthy quotations, defends Spinoza from the dangers of comparison with Hobbes or Machiavelli. Spinoza 282</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS turns out to have been on the side of the angels on practically all points, large and small, but since Dunner eschews closely reasoned exposition, it is sometimes not clear how he happened to be so fortu- nate. The last chapter is a sort of epilogue, or moral, wandering over a variety of contemporary topics, with an occasional reference to Spinoza. While there may be much right-thinking exhortation in it, it is scarcely a happy example of the influence of the great rationalist, Spinoza. MASON W. GROSS Rutgers University</page></plain_text>
