<plain_text><page sequence="1">Animal and Man in the New York Zoological Park By HELEN L. HOROWITZ The development of the New York Zoological Park reflected its founders' \iews not only of wild animals but of the human animal as well. Helen L. Horowitz is Assistant Professor of History at Scripps College, Member of the Claremont Colleges, Claremont, California. On November 8, 1899, the New York Zoological Park formally opened its grounds to the public. Henry Fair field Osborn, chairman of the executive committee of the board of managers of the park stood on the steps of the completed Reptile House to welcome the crowds not to one of the "small closed zoological gardens of Europe" but to "a free Park, projected upon a scale larger than has ever been attempted before."1 The distinction between zoological garden and zoological park was an important one, involving American as well as European experience. Since about 1856, New York's Central Park Zoo had presented wild animals in cages, a menagerie similar to the Jardin des Plantes in Paris. And in the early 1870s, Cincinnati and Philadelphia began to display animals in zoological gardens. Following European precedents, these institutions housed animals in decorative garden buildings to provide civilized recreation to an urban people. The zoological park was an innovation first attempted by officials of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. In 1889 Congress set aside 166 acres on which North American animals would live in relative freedom so that they might breed, thus averting extinction and also advanc 1. Henry F.

The National Zoological Park also planned to maintain foreign stock in traditional enclosures to allow comparison and to satisfy public curiosity. Congressional stinginess and second thoughts, however, severely limited the ability of the Smithsonian to accomplish its design.2 The New York Zoological Park, with generous municipal and private backing, had a much more promising begin ning. The mood and the goals of the New Yorkers were different. In his welcoming address, Osborn recalled the natural history of the site, the glacier which had created the rock formations, the primal· forest "whose noble off spring are the glory of the Park," and the animals who once roamed freely. "The Mastodon is beyond recall, but before long his collateral descendent, the elephant, will be here; and this afternoon, as you wander through the ranges, you will see restored to their old haunts all the other noble aborigines of Manhattan. Later we shall find a place upon the Buffalo Range for the Indian and his tepee."3 This great enterprise on a new scale in a glorious setting would restore to America the great animals of its past. The most important influence upon the project was the Boone and Crockett Club of New York. The club had been formed in 1887 by Theodore Roosevelt as a society of experienced big game hunters. Its interest in the sport was accompanied—as will be discussed below—by an interest in the preservation of animal life. In 1894, Madison Grant, a young lawyer and relatively new member, had brought to the club the idea of creating a zoological park, and he was made chairman of a committee, which included C. Grant LaFarge and Elihu Root, to organize a zoological society and to secure legislation enabling the formation of a zoological park. Working with William W. Niles, a New York assemblyman who had been seeking to establish a zoological garden, the committee got the desired legisla tion. The New York Zoological Society held its organizing meeting May 7, 1895. It placed nine members of the Boone 2.

During the year, other club members—Philip Schuyler and John L. Cadwalader—joined them, as did Assemblyman Niles and Henry Fairfield Osborn, a Columbia University professor later to head the American Museum of Natural History. According to Grant, the involvement of the Boone and Crockett Club went beyond these leaders: The club "came forward almost in a body—practically every New York City member—with money and with time."4 The board of managers invited William Temple Horna day, who had initiated the national zoo in Washington, to become superintendent of the projected zoological park. It was the opportunity Hornaday had longed for. He had felt his earlier schemes frustrated by a tyrannical Secretary of the Smithsonian and by the delays, complexity, and willfulness of government. Now he had the trust of "big men," businessmen, scientists, and lawyers out to establish 4.

Where others hesitated, he was definite. He selected the southern half of Bronx Park for its accessibility yet relative seclusion, its fine trees, its varied yet gentle terrain, its natural water supply, and its building sites. The land seemed ideal for creating not a zoological garden like those of Europe but a zoological park with nature as the con trolling principle. "We do not," he said, "wish a zoological park in which all the large buildings will loom up con spicuously, like the buildings of an exposition, with a park as a mere adjunct." The goal should instead be one where all is done "to screen and conceal the buildings from distant view, and in every possible way preserve the existing aspect of natural wildness which is conceded to be the highest attainment possible in the development of a park."6 In 1896 formal application for the transfer of the Bronx Park land to the zoological society was made to the Com missioners of the Sinking Fund. These city officials required a more detailed understanding of the society's intentions. Hornaday was dispatched to Europe to study the formal organization of other zoos and their plans. In March 1897, a contract was approved between the city and the society. The New York Zoological Society was to gather a collection of animals and construct animal buildings, spending at least $250,000. In return the city would "set apart and appropriate for the use" of the society the designated 261 acres, prepare the ground, and provide for maintenance of the park once it was established. The park would be open to the public without charge for five days a week, but would be allowed to charge admission for the remaining two. The society would control all concessions with the understanding that profits would be used to replenish collections. The city immediately allocated $125,000 for the improvement of the grounds. Its contribution for maintenance would steadily climb from the $40,000 initial grant to $167,632, budgeted in 1910. (In 1900, the city would pledge $300,000 for construction; 5. William T.

Control of the park's development, with the exception of approval by the Board of Parks of the final plan and of the award and superintendence of all large construction con tracts, rested in the hands of the zoological society.7 Membership in the society was open to those who were proposed and seconded by existing members and elected by the board of managers, and who were willing to pay the ten dollar annual fee. The society was seen primarily as a source of revenue and as a loyal constituency. Horn aday's goal of 3,000 members was not reached in this period, though the numbers steadily climbed from 118 at the end of the first year to 1,796 in 1910. The board of managers had been chosen at the initial meeting; its members were subject to reelection or replacement at the society's annual meeting at the expiration of their three year terms. Real power lay in the hands of the self perpetuating executive committee which met frequently to transact business. The executive committee was com posed of seven members of the board of managers, with the president and secretary of the society ex officio.8 In the early years, Madison Grant was secretary of the society and Henry Fairfield Osborn was chairman of the executive committee. Un his trip abroad, Hornaday also studied the design of European zoos and prepared for the Sinking Fund a general ground plan which located the animal buildings and ranges in the park. With a critical exception determined some years later, Hornaday's initial plan became the overall design of the New York Zoological Park.9 It thus gives a clear understanding of what Hornaday, the executive committee, and the board of managers wanted their zoolog ical park to be. Madison Grant reported to the Boone and Crockett Club that the "primary object" of the New York Zoological 7.

The bison thus had twenty acres of range, the moose eight wooded acres, the beaver a pond and stream, with trees and other materials for his dam and houses. The prairie dogs were allowed to establish a colony outside any enclo sure and to fend for themselves for food. Grant understood these features as defining the American park; he urged "the absolute preservation of all desirable natural features now existing, and the subordination of all structures and of landscape treatment to the needs of the specimens, and especially to the ranges of the larger animals." Con scious efforts were made to place the buildings for animals where they would be least obtrusive on the land.10 Whether by design or chance, the earliest buildings— the Reptile House (completed in 1899) and the great Flying Cage (1900)—put compatible animals together in areas that were large relative to the size of the animal, and placed them in naturalistic settings—water, logs, and plantings for reptiles; forest trees for birds.11 As Hornaday wrote in 1899, in the Flying Cage the park would attempt "to do for certain large and showy water birds, precisely what has been done for the hoofed animals, the beaver, otter, and other species—give them a section of Nature's own domain. In this they can fly to and fro, build nests and rear their young in real freedom."12 This plan was also followed in the large central cage in the Bird House (completed in 1905). In an important innovation, the birds of a particular region were grouped in a single cage or in adjoining cages. The common birds of Europe, for example, were in a single large cage. The animals thrived under these conditions, bred well, and assumed perfect plumage.13 10. Quote from Grant, "Origin of the New York Zoological Society," p. 318; see also William T.

In periodical articles the animals are pictured in action from within the enclosures as if they were in the wild. An early mammal brought into the park was photographed at the moment immediately before it was "liberated" onto its range.14 Hornaday remained responsible ior the development or the park and for the ground plans and zoological require ments of buildings. For this he drew freely on his knowl edge of European precedents and produced what he re garded as "a logical and fairly symmetrical zoological arrangement."15 The aesthetic design and arrangement of the structures was put in the hands of the architectural firm of C. Grant LaFarge and George Lewis Heins. LaFarge had been involved in the planning of the park from the beginning. A close friend of Theodore Roosevelt, a naturalist and hunter, he was a founding member of the board of managers of the society and its first secretary. Thus, with his partner, he rather naturally assumed the position of architect. The society could hardly have found one with better credentials. The eldest son of the painter John LaFarge, Grant LaFarge received architectural train ing at M.I.T. along with his classmate (future uncle by marriage) George Lewis Heins. The two had won the important—and presumably lifelong—commission for the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York, and during the years in which they did work for the zoo they were actively engaged in designing many public projects—chur ches, libraries, hospitals, subway stations.16 Heins and LaFarge's buildings were, with the exception of the elephant house, all of the same basic style—a modified classic worked in a buff brick and stone. Unlike tlv, initial buildings on the ranges, they tended to dominate their surroundings "like the buildings of an exposition," that Hornaday had forsworn, and they were elegant and 14.

Hornaday had planned a relatively inexpensive enclosure for Aquatic Birds, but the Heins and LaFarge building actually cost over two and a half times what Hornaday had projected." The contrast between the initial plan of the Aquatic Bird House and the final design of the structure was an important element in the subsequent development of the park. The real nature of Heins and LaFarge's design became clear with the planning of Baird Court. On this high, grassy area, named for Spencer Fullerton Baird of the Smithsonian, Hornaday had envisioned a rather casual arrangement of buildings. His overall plan—Baird Court and the ranges—was a more elaborate version of the one he had devised for the National Zoological Park in Wash ington some years earlier, the first to combine traditional zoological garden with animal preserves. But in the 1897 "Final Plan," which was determined by the architect as well as the director, Baird Court took the form of a ceremonial city, a severely formal arrangement of palatial dwellings arranged in a long, narrow rectangle. The lion house, administrative building, and bird house formed its western side; the monkey house, subtropical house, and restaurant, its eastern. The center space was both formal garden and sea lion pool with an extending reflecting pool. Closing off the southern end was the elephant house; the northern end was to be an entrance way that would take the name Grand Concourse.18 When the plan was proposed, i-lornaday was outraged. Unlike his own plan of 1896, which would "not involve the cutting of a single tree," Hornaday confided to his wife, "The Heins and LaFarge plan, which Osborn has practically agreed to, involves the cutting of a number (about 15) fine trees." He added, "/ am afraid of it. It is not necessary for the trees to be cut, and I will be drawn and quartered before I will ever admit that it is!"19 17.

From Harper's Weekly, March 20, 1897. Though the Heins and LaFarge-Hornaday plan was presented to the city as the "Final Plan" and approved by the park board in 1897, discussion of Baird Court continued for two years. Its ultimate design was determined at an executive committee meeting on May 31, 1899, formally adopted in July, and reported on in the fourth Annual Report. Effort was made to downplay whatever 434</page><page sequence="10">A nimal and Man changes had been made: "None of the general features of this plan have been or will be departed from." The essential change was described as a decision to make Baird Court less formal to allow for greater crowds and to have its northern border serve as a carriage entrance.20 Examination of the two plans and discussion at the time reveal that the 1899 revision gave Baird Court an even more formal aspect. In lyuu, the Sun, a New York newspaper edited at the time by Grant LaFarge's friend Paul Dana, editor ialized about the revisions in the design for Baird Court. Hornaday assumed, probably rightly, that the arguments were LaFarge's.21 As the Sun understood it, the changes were hardly trivial. For one thing, they altered the axis of the court. LaFarge's design would have been closed on the north with "a charming natural feature, consisting of a certain rock and a certain tree." The revision would destroy this. Moreover, rather than following the gentle slope downward to the north, the court would be made artificially horizontal through land fill, requiring "a descent from the meadow ... as abrupt as a waterfall and without its beauty." The Sun rebuked Osborn and the executive committee for letting a civil engineer rather than an architect make such critical changes (a reference, presum alby, to H.A. Capara, the landscape architect of the society) and for treating a public park as a "toy for their own pleasure." This was a lamentable procedure "no matter how great their wealth or how high their social standing."22 But Heins and LaFarge lost, for the Caparn-Executive 20. Henry F. Osborn to Lucretia P.

A board of experts which included Charles F. McKim, one of the Chicago World's Fair architects and a prime expositor of academic Renaissance building and planning, gave its approval.23 Hornaday hoped that the architects would be ousted and replaced by men of better taste, but despite the tactic of taking to the public prints and openly criticizing the executive committee, Heins and LaFarge kept their position and retained their satisfactory working relationship with Osborn. With the landscape architect James L. Greenleaf, they gradually worked out the Baird Court that can still be seen today.24 On a flat plateau Heins and LaFarge's classic buildings line a grassy lawn, divided only by walks. At the northern end the abrupt drop has been turned into an Italian garden with ornamental balustrades and steps. The end point is a massive Italian fountain, moved from Lake Como by William Rockefeller, placed in the park in 1902 and shifted to its present site in 1910.25 The southern end is the elephant house, all in stone, topped by a dome. This arrangement was not conceived in a cultural vacuum; it had a precise and impressive model. The amazing fact is that this grouping of structures and land scaping, located in New York City and designed to house and display wild animals, is a recreation of the Court of Honor of the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893.26 There is the same approach from the open end marked by a monument; the flat, open regular space surrounded by buildings of related design with the same cornice line; and the same domed building cutting off the line of vision. Surrounding the court, characterized by "classic formality," is the remainder of the park, largely to the south and east purposely left, as far as possible, in a natural state.27 Surrounding the Court of Honor at the World's Columbian Exposition were the state and foreign 23.

Further complementing the parallel between the Exposition and the zoo was the conception of the latter as an international gathering of animals, including, in Osborn's words, "A World Con gress of Lions."28 The World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 was a stun ning event in American architecture and planning.

Its influence helped to turn American architecture in creasingly toward academic formalism; and, first in the 1902 McMillan Plan for Washington and culminating in the Chicago Plan of 1909, it provided an image that reshaped American cities.29 The whole scheme—Court of Honor, informal surround with Wooded Isle—was appropriated. Baird Court is a ceremonial city whose inhabitants are segregated and con fined in ways suitable for observation. Beyond are animal buildings and less formally treated areas such as those between the Reptile, Small Mammal, and Antelope Houses. And finally, the outlying areas, developed in the earliest days of the zoological park, where American mammals are allowed to roam in relative freedom in naturalistic settings so that they might breed. This scheme was not fixed in the beginning. Only the original goal, carried out in the ranges and in the early structures, had been clear—to place herds of North American game animals on generous grounds as close to their natural settings as possible. Only over time did plans for Baird Court gradually crystallize, did elements come together to form Court of Honor alongside Wooded Isle. This develop ment paralleled, I think, the changing ideas of the leaders of the New York Zoological Park as they shifted their central concerns from wild animals to human beings. An examination of this evolution must begin with the Boone and Crockett Club, which directed the creation of the New York Zoological Park and which enlisted the services of Henry Fairfield Osborn in the task of creating the park. When Theodore Roosevelt established the club it was a society of big game hunters, all friends or relatives of Roosevelt. While these men may have identified themselves with America's frontier past, they 29.

Field who let me see her dissertation on Daniel Burnham as an urban planner, in preparation. In this regard, Hornaday's comment on planning the park is of interest: "It was like planning a town from the ground up" (box 17, Hornaday papers, LC).</page><page sequence="14">Animal and Man 439 were wealthy and well-born New Yorkers: Charles Bird Grinnell, Elliot and J. West Roosevelt, Archibald and E.P. Rogers, John J. Pierrepont, and Rutherford Stuyve sant.30 These gentlemen shared a common interest in, as they put it, "manly sport with the rifle." The club provided them with hospitable occasions to share the lore and adventures of the hunt. In setting the ground rules for membership in the club, the initiators required one to have killed "with the rifle, in fair chase, by still hunting or otherwise, at least one individual each of three of the various kinds of American large game." "Fair chase" was clearly defined to insure that the animal be given a chance and that, with two exceptions, it be an adult male.31 The club quickly moved into game preservation in the effort to protect American wildlife. On the surface there appears to be a contradiction here—predators who are also protectors. But these men did not see it that way. Hunting, once a largely individual, utilitarian enterprise, was characterized after the Civil War by two approaches— the systematic killing of animals by commercial hunters; and the hunting of animals for sport by American gentle men, such as the members of the Boone and Crockett Club. The latter's commitment to preserve large game in America through new legislation and the enforcement of existing game laws did not go against their own interests as hunters. It was directed against those business hunters who did not impose limits on their destruction of game. Involved also were the feelings of Easterners against West erners, or as they saw it, of altruists against exploiters.32 In simultaneously celebrating the hunt and working for game protection, the Boone and Crockett Club was talking about two different kinds of hunting, two different classes of hunters. Or so they thought. Sometimes they violated 30.

Roosevelt responded privately, "I wish to Heaven he had done anything else, save committing murder."33 Yet pointing to a class distinction does not resolve the other important tension, the relation between interest in animals and the taking of their lives. A goal of the club was "to promote inquiry into, and to record observa tions on the habits and natural history of, the various wild animals."34 In a series of volumes beginning 1897, the club published articles by its members on various species. These amateur gentlemen naturalists discovered, observed, measured, and photographed. Madison Grant had a species of caribou named for him, the rangifer granii. Yet these same men took pride in their prowess as hunters.35 The animals they carefully measured were generally the victims of their aim. Grant LaFarge's son described hunting with his father—the ritual of the pre-dawn rising, the manly breakfast, the preparations, the enforced quiet. He saw and understood his father's involvement through eyes trained by the Indian whose rites express "the communion of love between a hunter and the game he seeks to kill."36 Yet Grant LaFarge was no more an Indian than he was a Western pioneer. His seriousness and his relation to his prey must be understood in other terms. Theodore Roosevelt wrote oí" big game hunting as a test of the self. What is most required, beyond the skills learned through practice, is "cool judgment and that kind of nerve which consists in avoiding being rattled." This "nerve control, cool-headedness" can only be acquired by actual practice and "repeated effort and repeated excercise 33.

The hunt intensified the process by making the challenge immediate and dangerous and by allowing proof of the experience in the heads and horns gained. The repeated ritual of the hunt was a repeated ritual of trial and victory. The objects upon which one acted bore a curious relation to one's self. A profound identification was established between predator and prey. Since the animals were necessary for the ritual of encounter and mastery, their extermination threatened the self. Thus the hunter joined in efforts to establish and enforce protective legislation and to create preserve areas where the animals could be secure. One sought to possess them in all the ways possible—collecting their heads and horns, compiling photographs and data about them, giving them one's name, keeping live herds under one's supervision. The New York Zoological Park was, in its early years, a systematic extension of the naturalist-hunter's possession, particularly on the ranges where the native American game animals were to be gathered. One has the sense that, at least in the minds of its Boone and Crockett supporters, the park was created as a rather private endeavor, that "the animals owned by the New York Zoological Society were the corporate extension of a personal herd. Throughout the lives oí those most responsible lor the New York Zoological Park, hunting, naturalism, and preser vation retained their interest and force. In 1906, the society initiated, under Hornaday's prodding, the National Collec tion of Heads and Horns—to which Hornaday presented his entire collection of 131 specimens—whose goal was a collec tion of heads representing each species of large American game and of horned animals throughout the world. The result was a combination museum, which included pur chased rarities, and a trophy room which would house such particularly fine specimens "that any sportsman may fairly regard it as an honor to be represented in the 37. Theodore Roosevelt, An Autobiography (New York, 1920), p. 32.</page><page sequence="17">NEW YORK HISTORY National Collection."38 The public was not welcomed into the initial exhibition rooms. In 1922, a separate building was opened to display the collection. Furthermore, leaders of the society were prominent in a variety of natural preservation movements. Hornaday established and headed the American Bison Society in which Osborn and Grant were both active members. Osborn was president of the Audubon Society, and he and Grant helped form the Save-the-Redwood League. The society was instrumental in the establishment of the National Bison Herd on the Wichita Forest Reserve in 1906. In an agreement with Congress, the New York Zoological Society promised to stock the wildlife refuge if the area were fenced and the animals maintained. In 1907, fifteen bison of the New York Zoological Park were shipped to the Wichita ranges.39 Despite these enorts, interest in nature and preservation became subordinate, except in the case of Hornaday, to an increasing concern with American society and its peoples, specifically with the way American values and American life were being destroyed by foreigners. The two were deeply connected. The North American game animals were linked with their hunters to the older, purer America. They were being threatened by the forces of commercialism that put a premium on tongues of buffalo, on furs, and on feathers. This same commercialism had encouraged unrestricted immigration for cheap labor, never considering its costs to society. And now the foreigners were on the verge of engulfing the true Americans who alone held and expressed the American values. These feelings, probably of long standing, were expressed privately through choice of friendship, through criteria for club membership, and through the effort to reform urban politics and install the "right" officials.40 They 38.

Built on city land, with municipal funds, decision making was kept in the hands of the board of managers of the society, thus removing the park from interference by politicians. In the late 1890s a shift began to take place. Increasingly what had been implicit, veiled, came out in the open, and as it did the New York Zoological Park developed a new mission. Baird Court assumed the form of the Court of Honor to bring to an urban population not wilderness but civilization.

The dreams of breeding herds which fed upon the ranges in the Bronx were broken when the park pathologist reported in 1902 that the bison and other hoofed animals were dying of gastroenteritis from grass poisoning. The proposed remedy was severe—that all natural vegetation and topsoil be removed and the ground be covered with asphalt or macadam so that the staff would have total control of food and water.41 The report was not acted upon immediately. Perhaps the park founders were not yet prepared to accept the proposition that a zoological park could not place animals in a recreation of the natural environment, but demanded the creation of a profoundly artificial one. The animals con tinued to suffer and to die until 1904, when the pathologists won a partial victory and the land was stripped of its natural cover. "We have been compelled," stated the director's report, "to choose between animals and grass." In addition, most of the great game animals—moose, antelope, caribou, mule deer, and Columbian black-' tailed deer—had trouble adapting to a new environment. The society was determined to experiment with these species until a majority were established in the park, and Hornaday accepted the effort as his own responsibility, but by 1913, the park accepted the fact that the moose, caribou, and prong-horn antelope could not be maintained and the society resolved to purchase no more of them.42 The zoological society, from the earliest possession of the site, also had problems with the human inhabitants of the region. The park had been left in a wild, undevel oped state. It had seemed to residents of the area an appropriate place to forage for firewood. The director's report for 1898 stated that on the western and southern bounds of the park there lived many Italian laborers, who in past years had come to believe that they had a right "to cut any tree in Bronx Park which they can cut without detection, and to remove anything that 41.

A more troubling issue took its place—the shooting of songbirds by Italian immigrants on park grounds. Such a misunder standing of American liberty evoked a scolding, the distribution of 3,000 copies of the newly-enacted law prohibiting the carrying of firearms by aliens and its publication in Italian newspapers, the stalking of the grounds by park officials proud of their ability to terrorize the miscreants, and the arrest and conviction of those caught in the act.44 The most publicized effort to correct the deportment of those who enjoyed park privileges came with the celebrated rubbish war. Hornaday stated in his 1907 report that he had lost all patience with the propensity to litter on the part of "lower class aliens," who persisted in acts in the United States, at least in the parks, that they had not dared do in their native countries. He thereupon initiated a concentrated effort "to educate a certain portion of the public of New York out of the idea that a public park is a place for unlimited license and disorder."45 A larger staff was assigned, private detec tives were hired, signs were posted, evildoers were rebuked, and Hornaday began a public correspondence in the press to teach the newcomers proper standards of decorum. Relationship with the public took on a tense, hostile note. Hornaday wrote in his 1914 report of "ten per cent of the people of this city . . . not fit to live in civilized communities," of "low-lived beasts who appreciate nothing and love filth and disorder."46 No suggestion here that the wild animal is a source of value. Externally, the nation was beginning a conscious process in the Progressive period of altering its institutions to face the realities of economic growth and national inte gration.

But the individuals and the movements that the park's founders early encouraged moved beyond them and became concerned with issues of social justice. Theodore Roosevelt was a kind of fulcrum. He was one of them in a way that was never lost; holding on to his old ties and interests, he was also able to compromise with enemies, to learn from others, to in novate.48 Some of his friends were able to move with him, either politically like Gifford Pinchot or personally like Grant LaFarge. But others stopped, held to the verities of 1890, and felt increasingly threatened and besieged. Their anxiety was heightened by the new wave of immigration that brought to America great numbers of Southern and Eastern Europeans. Madison Grant and Henry Fairfield Osborn were among the embattled. The park they created expressed their changing mood. Baird Court became the dream city of frustrated imperialists and racists. There was a strong explicit connection in the period between imperialism and the zoological garden. Hornaday attributed the greatness of the London zoo, especially the completeness of its collections, to England's position as a colonizing power with more territory throughout the world than any other country. This had two effects. Imperialism involved the practical presence of Englishmen as well-paid officials and as travellers who were eager to add rare specimens to the zoo's collections. More important was the sense that imperial presence meant outright possession. The kangaroo collection in the London zoo "is said to be the best in existence. And inasmuch 47. Augustus Cerillo, Jr., "The Reform of Municipal Government in New York City," The New-York Historical Society Quarterly, LVII (January 1973), 51-71, clarifies the distinction between the older supporters of reform, who included Madison Grant, and their progressive successors. 48. Osborn wrote to his wife how Roosevelt surprised Osborn's academic colleagues "by the cordiality of his greeting to me as 'old man' " and by his holding Osborn to talk about pumas (Henry F. Osborn to Lucretia P.

One has the sense that he intended something beyond a fanciful play upon the state's nickname, for he used the term in relation to the city's ability to command resources, to express its greatness and power in the park.50 While London s example retained its force, the ideal for the New York Zoological Park came to be the Berlin zoo, noted for its monumental, highly-decorated animal buildings and the completeness of its collections. Berlin, "the pacemaker," excited the admiration and envy of the New York group and led them to emulation, but the German practice was quite the opposite of the Bronx park's use of the ranges. Imitation of European practice required that animals in the lion, monkey, and elephant houses be in cells which lined one or both sides of long, rectangular sheds. The goal was completeness; the zoo was to hold representatives of as many species as possible. On January 1, 1912, the New York Zoological Park boasted of 1,251 species, probably "equal to the greatest number exhibited elsewhere," and 4,838 specimens, "far in advance of all other collections of living wild animals." The elephant house, for example, was not de signed to contain a large number of identical elephants, but to house a collection as nearly complete zoologically as possible.51 The animal was considered as if it were an inanimate museum object. The goal was a three dimensional, living encyclopedia. The enclosures of the elephant house, it was proudly stated, display the animal "as perfectly as a frame fits a picture."52 This mode of exhibition was related to imperialism 49. William T.

While it was constantly stated that the animals in the park will not be imprisoned, that the king of beasts will not lie "in durance vile,"53 in fact in the Baird Court buildings the large mammals were placed in cells. These enclosures stated frankly their purpose: from all nations (and par ticularly Africa and Asia) came tribute to testify to the power of their conquerers. One senses a pleasure in this period in the sight of caged wildness, the lion confined by man, his strength helpless against the walls that enclose him.54 Yet this was not Imperial Rome. Just as nineteenth century Americans took up their international respon sibilities as the White Man's Burden, so did the park officials cloak the confinement of animals in benevolence. In commenting on the fine spirits of the giraffes in the London zoo, Hornaday reflected, "And why should they not be happier than any of their congeners in Africa? They are safe from the rifles of game-killers, hunger 53. "The Lion House," Zoological Society Bulletin, No. 8 (January 1903), 37. 54.

The leaders of the park all considered themselves to be evolutionists (and with the Scopes trial in Tennessee in the 1920s Henry Fairfield Osborn became a polemicist). In their writings as naturalists they gave a great deal of attention to the question of whether the evolved traits of a particular animal entitled it to be regarded as a distinct species. Madison Grant paid particular attention to the development of variants in North America, and the strength of their relative differences from European counterparts.57 But their belief in evolution did not lessen 55.

The wild animal existed for man's benefit. Hornaday stated, "The highest function that any wild animal can serve, living or dead, is to go on exhibition, as a representative of its species, to be seen and studied by millions of serious-minded people."58 The zoo specimen was fortunate to be chosen for this role. Man was also the greatest animal. Thoughtful attention was given to the capabilities of the primates. Yet in keeping with the anthropomorphism that the leaders of the zoo shared with their age, the animal was always measured in terms of man. The primate was separated from his own community and taught some of the tricks of humans. The performances organized by the staff to amuse visitors were supposedly to teach the extent of animal intelligence. But was the pleasure in watching "Orang-utans Eating at a Table" derived from their intel ligence or from their comic stupidity? Did such a display not reinforce the audience's belief in its own superiority? And what of the analogy that early twentieth-century Americans made between the higher primates and Negroes within their own society? In 1906, this was clearly reinforced when the park exhibited a human pigmy in an enclosure in the monkey house. While it was afterward argued that Ota Benga was hired by the park to care for the chimpanzees, his own cage did have a full specimen card, describing him in the same terms used for the animals. Hornaday's explanation that European zoos had ethnographic displays was equally shaky, for the native peoples exhibited by Carl Hagenbeck in Germany demon strated elements of their culture and served as a part of a scene painting much in the way that Osborn thought of having Indians in teepees on the buffalo ranges. (The totem pole and house built by Tlinglit Indians installed on the park grounds was in keeping with this European spirit.) Leaders in the New York Negro com munity, and from as far away as Charlotte, North Carolina, regarded the exhibition of Benga as a deep insult to their race.59 58. Hornaday, "Zoological Park of Our Day," 543.</page><page sequence="26">Animal and Man Finally, the park was committed to exhibiting typical members of each species, rather than some of the rarities of nature. It was to be no sideshow. Nor was it to encourage the breaking of natural laws by the development of new hybrids among its specimens.60 Each species was to be kept separate in its own enclosure, a marked contrast to the city outside the park where such control could not be exercised over human beings. The New York Zoological Park was effectively completed in 1911 with the opening of the elephant house and the final landscaping of Baird Court. Thereafter the modifica tions were minor, involving service facilities, repair, and expansion. For almost thirty years the park seemed to require only maintenance. Of those most influential in its development only Grant LaFarge withdrew. He not only had lost the fight for Baird Court, but Heins's death ended a fruitful partnership and LaFarge's career declined with the withdrawal of the commission for the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. Hornaday remained director of the park until 1926. Osborn, chairman of the executive committee of the society of early years, served as president from 1909 until 1925. Grant, secretary until 1925, became chairman of the executive committee in 1909 and president in 1926; he held both offices until his death in 1937. During this period there was no effort to rethink the basic nature of the park's design. Carl Hagenbeck had demonstrated in Germany and at expositions in this country the barless, moated enclosures and scenic panoramas with artificial rock backgrounds. Elements of his approach were initiated at the New York Zoological Park during its early years, not only on the ranges for North American animals, but also in the habitat environments of reptiles and birds. Reluctantly, Hornaday had been given permission to establish a moun 59. Raymond L.

Baird Court continued to offer to its inhabitants indoor cells and outdoor cages at a time when zoos in the Midwest were adapting the Hagenbeck system. Madison Grant strongly disapproved of Hagenbeck's approach; he abhorred artificial rock and regarded the barless en closure as a fad.62 As the park absorbed less or their creative energies, each of the leaders turned to other areas of activity. Hornaday moved into conservation and military prepared ness. The park had never been for Osborn more than a Tuesday afternoon and evening affair which he juggled along with his primary interests, the American Museum of Natural History, scientific investigation, teaching, and writing. Madison Grant had given his immediate, almost daily oversight to the park. But beginning in the second decade, he involved himself in conservation, and increas ingly turned his attention to articulating his pride, his anger, and his fears through the development of racial history and the formulation of political theory.63 At the height of the Progressive period Madison Grant wrote his elegy and his warning, The Passing of the Great Race. He was a deep conservative, not in the usual American sense of advocating laissez-faire as the bedrock of the Constitution, but in what we generally regard as a European tradition, cherishing responsibility to the past, limiting the rights of individuals, and thinking of society in hierarchical terms of dominance and sub ordination. His "absorbing mission" was to save "for posterity all the fine, noble and worthwhile things his generation had inherited ... as if all these were his personal responsibility."64 The zoo had been part of an effort "to preserve to future generations some remnant of the 61.

It is no longer generally conceded that the local inhabitants of any given district have a divine commission to pollute streams with sawdust, to destroy the forests by ax or fire, or to slaughter every living thing within reach of rifle, trap or poisoned bait. . . . The game and the forests belong to the nation, and not to the individual, and the use of them by the individual citizen is limited to such privileges as may be accorded him by law.66 Grant added to his Burkean conservatism an absolute identification of the nation with an admittedly small segment of its population. He accepted a racial division of mankind learned from the work of William Z. Ripley. Europeans were fundamentally of three groups—Nordics, Alpines, and Mediterraneans. Nordics included Anglo Saxons, French Huguenots, Scotch-Irish (as well as Jesus and the creators of the Aryan strain of language); thus early America was fundamentally Nordic. To Grant, the races—or species—of man differed not only in physical attributes but in levels of intelligence and in character traits. In all the ways that mattered—leadership, love of liberty, beauty—Nordics were superior. Their strength was the source of greatness in the nation, not its system of government, so vastly inferior to aristocracy, that "govern ment by the wisest and best." Now this racial greatness was threatened by the infusions of immigrants. With the Civil War the growth of the economy led to the encourage ment of immigration not of Nordics but of "a large and increasing number of the weak, the broken, and the mentally crippled of all races drawn from the lowest stratum of the Mediterranean basin and the Balkans, together with hordes of the wretched, submerged popula tions of the Polish Ghettos." These newcomers now threatened the habitat of the Nordic who was "with drawing from the scene, abandoning to these aliens the land which he conquered and developed." Even more dangerously they would destroy the rest by interbreeding, leading to the loss of the specialized traits which "are 65. Grant, "Origin of New York Zoological Park," p. 320. 66.

Soc., XII (1907), 127.</page><page sequence="29">NEW YORK HISTORY highly unstable and when mixed with generalized or primitive characters, tend to disappear." Thus "the cross between a white man and an Indian is an Indian; the cross between a white man and a negro is a negro . . . the cross between any of three European races and a Jew is a Jew."67 Grant had three remedies to propose. He sought to halt immigration by non-Nordics, partially achieved in the National Origins Act of 1924 that he influenced.68 He wanted states to extend the laws against miscegenation. And he proposed the progressive sterilization of the weakest ten percent of the population, beginning "with the criminal, the diseased, and the insane, and extending gradually to types which may be called weaklings rather than defectives, and perhaps ultimately to worthless race types."69 The foreword to Madison Grant's The Passing of the Great Race was written by Henry Fairfield Osborn. In this and other introductions to Grant that would follow, Osborn tried to distinguish between racism as a theory (to which he adhered) and the ranking of races as inferior or superior (to which he theoretically objected). But the effort was a weak one, for on a personal level Osborn felt the same revulsion toward other groups as Madison Grant. And because he identified America as Nordic, he could, on the basis of national loyalty, take the same policy positions on immigration as Grant.70 While Osborn claimed scientific objectivity, this spirit seemed to have been lacking in his acceptance of Grant's request of 1929 that he write a paper "on the impair ment of American ideals through the lowering of standards of American life by foreigners."71 By then the American strand was being battered, he felt, both by fundamentalists 67.

Yet, the words are significant, I would argue, for they are the end point of a process that was set in motion at the turn of the century and was reflected in the successive development and plans of the park. Grant and Osborn were racists all their lives. But in the late nineteenth century they satisfied their need for mastery through hunting or its related naturalism, conservation, and establishment of preserve areas. As experiences in the park and in the wider political arena shaped them, they came to feel increasingly threatened by the society and sought to create an environment both for animals and for humans of order and control. If not in 1906 then by 1916,'Madison Grant wished he could have separated the non-Nordic races in America and put them in their enclosures, keeping them powerless and pure. He would have wanted the open ranges to be reserved for native Americans to breed and replenish their stock. 72. Henry F.
