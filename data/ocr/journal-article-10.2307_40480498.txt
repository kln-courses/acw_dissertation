<plain_text><page sequence="1">Royal armour from Spain Washington byJANIS TOMLINSON titian's portrait of Charles V at the Battle of Mühlberg (Museo del Prado, Madrid) is the guest of honour who was unable to attend the celebration that is the exhibition The Art of Power: Royal Armor and Portraits from Imperial Spain at the National Gallery of Art, Wash- ington (to ist November).1 Although it might seem churlish to open with what did not find its way into the exhibition, that familiar masterpiece, in which imperial tradition and power, victory and military prowess are com- memorated by consummate artistry, parallels the artistic accomplishment of less familiar masters such as Felipo Negroli and Desiderius Helmschmid, whose work is celebrated here. On loan from the Armería Real in Madrid, their armour is restored to its rightful place among tapestries from the collection of the Patrimonio Nacional and royal portraits as a reminder that armour once was more highly valued than the portraits we admire today. The exhibition was curated by Alvaro Soler del Campo, Director of the Armería Real. Titian's portrait is invoked by a small repro- duction within the wall text in the fifth of eight galleries, serving to introduce the Battle of Mühlberg. Next to it stands the armour worn in that portrait, part of the Mühlberg garniture, made by Helmschmid in 1544 (cat. nos.42-44). It was again donned for a second full-length portrait by Titian known today only through copies, one of which, by Juan Pantoja de la Cruz, 1608, is exhibited here (no.45). This exhibition seeks to recover the original significance of armour, easily over- looked in installations in which it is isolated from the other arts. Armour gained meaning and stature by association with significant historical events. The flower-pattern armour, made by Helmschmid for Philip II (no. 46- 47) and commemorated in Titian's full-length portrait of c. 1 5 50-5 1 (Museo del Prado; not in exhibition), for example, was probably delivered to the prince in Augs- burg, the final stop on his journey through Italy, Austria, Germany and the Netherlands to gain support for his ultimately unsuccess- ful bid to succeed his father as Emperor. Soler draws a comparison between armour - made by a small number of makers for an extremely wealthy clientele - and today's haute couture. Yet while other costumes linked with specific events have long since been lost, armour was treasured and regard- ed as part of the dynastic heritage. It is only in the fifth gallery that a theme - armour in portraiture - becomes explicit. In the catalogue Soler defines three discrete sections: the evolution of armour in fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century Spain; armour as works of art that symbolise power; and armour in court portraiture.

Scholars and history burls will undoubtedly get it, but enhanced wall texts might have better guided the less knowledgeable viewer. The exhibition opens with a preamble: a one-hundred-foot-long section of the fresco of the Hall of Battles in the Escorial, commis- sioned by Philip II to commemorate the victories of the Spanish monarchy, has been digitally reproduced to scale. One enters through the sixteenth-century doorway to see a single object encased in the centre of the room: a parade helmet by Negroli for Emper- or Charles V made in Milan in 1533 (no.i; Fig.73). Inspired by classical precedents, the anthropomorphic helmet recreates the blond curls and beard of the young emperor who would wear it. It is a story of imperial one- upmanship: in 1532 Negroli forged a helmet with curly hair for Francesco Maria della Rovere, Duke of Urbino (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), and the Emperor wanted a similar but better piece. So his helmet has not only hair but also a bearded, removable bevor, as well as other imperial devices, including a collar embossed with the Order of the Gold- en Fleece. The bard of Maximilian I, on a model steed (no. 9; Fig. 72), dominates the second gallery, surrounded by masterworks of fifteenth-cen- tury Spanish and Islamic armour: the exquis- itely decorated Nasrid sword and scabbard of C.1400 (Museo del Ejército, Toledo; no.4), believed to have belonged to the last sultan of Granada, stands out. The stage is set for what is to come, as Charles's ancestors are invoked through portraits, including that of his father, Philip the Handsome, seen in the earliest known portrait of a king of Spain in armour, of ci 504-06 (Musées royaux des Beaux- Arts de Belgique, Brussels; no. io). The anonymous portrait of Charles V aged seven with a sword (Kunsthistorisches Mus- eum, Vienna; no. 14) introduces the golden age of armour, the subject of the two largest 73.

National Gallery of Art, Washington). galleries in the exhibition. In both, tapestries are intended as background, although their inclusion threatens to upstage the armour. That commemorating Charles's review of his troops in Barcelona in 1535 (no.21) from the Conquest of Tunis series - the costliest series of tapestries commissioned by Charles V and woven by Wilhelm Pannemaker between 1548 and 1554 - dominates the first large gallery. Charles V, his brother and the Duke of Alba are portrayed. The relationship of actual armour to imagery is emphasised by the placement of three suits of armour directly in front of this tapestry; however, this invites the viewer to seek specific com- parisons between armour and image, even though none can be found. In the same gallery, Helmschmid's embossed, etched and gilt helmet for Charles V of 1540 (no. 22) illustrates armour as imperial symbol: its visor takes the form of an eagle's head, whose body extends over the bowl as its talons reach over the cheek piece. The tapestry of Fame (no. 3 7) from the Hon- ours series (Brussels, c.1520), with fifty square metres covered with gesticulating worthies who respond to the central figure of trumpet- ing Fame, dominates the largest gallery of the exhibition. It is breathtaking. Still, some wall text to explain its inclusion - the role of tapestries at the Imperial court; its theme as a foil for the trophy and parade armour that dominates this gallery - is called for. The theme of fame and glory is brought home by the selection of parade armour on view - most notably intricately crafted burgonets and shields. The Italian origin of the pieces crafted in the second half of the sixteenth century attests to the loss of the central European territories to Charles's imperial successor, Fer- dinand I; the predominance of ceremonial armour reminds us that Philip II did not inherit the martial tastes of his father. Eventually the function of armour became secondary to its symbolic role. Although Philip II did not share his father's enthusiasm for armour or war, he was eager to commem- orate imperial glory, not only in the Escorial's Hall of Battles, but also through the creation of the Royal Armoury. Armour was increas- ingly invoked to celebrate tradition or claim prestige, as when Rubens follows Titian in portraying Philip II wearing the flower- pattern armour in his equestrian portrait of 1630-40 (Museo del Prado, Madrid; no. 48); that same armour is worn by Juan Francisco Alfonso de Pimentel in the portrait ascribed to Velazquez of c.1648 (Museo del Prado; no. 49). Ultimately, appropriation of this heritage extended beyond dynasty, as the exhibition concludes with Anton Raphael Mengs's portrait of Charles III - a Bourbon - in armour. 1 Catalogue: The Art of Power: Royal Armor and Portraits from Imperial Spain.
