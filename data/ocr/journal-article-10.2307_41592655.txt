<plain_text><page sequence="1">Instructional Uses for "Supermarket" Books Elda Maase Recently I found an educational use for the little, inexpensive children's books avail- able in supermarkets or variety stores for about twenty-five cents. These books are not reviewed in educational media, but they must be selling widely, and they do fit into several classifications of children's literature that college students discuss and evaluate as part of their preparation for becoming teachers or librarians. Since a student can examine and write reviews of several of these books in an hours time, I use them to test ability to classify books and to perceive some of the knowledge about books my students will have to use some day. Huck and Kuhns Children's Literature t in the Elementary School (1968) includes "A Taxonomy of Literary Understanding and Skills," which, according to the authors, "is suggestive of the kind of behavioral goals that should be achieved in the ele- mentary school." My students had been good at memorizing the taxonomy, but the test with little books helped evaluate their own understanding and skill. Also, although I began my collection of books to use in a testing process, I have found some books well worth recommending for further rea- sons. Many folk tales are retold in these highly illustrated books for little children. These tales may even be the best sellers, because no doubt the adults buying them will be attracted to old favorites. I expect my stu- dents to recognize them as stories from oral tradition. Technically, they can do so even if they do not know a particular tale, because no authors name appears on the title page. Although whether a fairy tale is a folk tale or a modern fantasy may not affect the enjoyment of a particular story, both adults and older elementary school- children can profit from their understand- ing of oral tradition and can enjoy continu- ing the tradition by retelling the stories in new ways. In this spirit, gifted illustrators are constantly publishing picture book ver- sions of individual tales from the ever- growing collections of folk tales from all lands. Gail Haley's A Story- A Story : An Afri- can Tale , which won the Caldecott medal in 1971, explains the origin of the spider tale, favorite African folk material. After discovering this book, one sixth grade teacher prepared to tell this story aloud to her class before introducing the book itself because she thought her students might reject a picture book as too juvenile. She then used the bright, humorous illus- trations to interest them in reading and re- telling other African stories. Arbuthnot and Sutherland's Children and Books (1972), pages 175-6, lists many sources for African folk tales, including another picturebook, Why the Sun and the Moon Live in the Sky , which has "beautifully detailed and Elda Maase is Associate Professor of English at Indiana Institute of Technology at Fort Wayne. 499</page><page sequence="2">500 Elementary English stylized art work" that "is based on African sources." Picture books illustrating single tales taken from collections of folk tales can inspire all ages of elementary children to creative activity: examining various ver- sions of the same old tale may help them see possible ways of retelling it themselves in drawings or dramatizations. Such a com- parative study might involve hearing Per- raulťs Puss in Boots and looking at picture book illustrations of the story by Marcia Brown (Scribner's, 1952) and by Hans Fischer (Harcourt, 1959). What has this to do with the little, in- expensive children's books? They can be useful sources in a search for different ver- sions of old folk tales. Two series (Rand M cN ally's Junior Elf Books and Whitmans Tell-a-Tale Books) provide two different versions of "Little Red Riding Hood" as well as versions of several other folk tales. Children can be encouraged to bring from home any copies they have and to search libraries for the more prestigious picture book versions. Drawing from another tra- ditional literature area, Brian Wildsmith, for example, has created five different pic- ture books to retell La Fontaine's fables. His strong, full color art work should in- trigue the most sophisticated older elemen- tary student even though the text he uses is suitable for reading to younger children. Several Aesop fables appear in single-tale, picture book editions. Huck and Kuhns taxonomy suggests children (and therefore elementary teach- ers! ) should "recognize folk tales," identify traditional beginnings and endings," "locate repetition of phrases and episodes," and "realize characters are usually stereotypes symbolizing extremes." So far I have col- lected ten little books to use in my test; ten that might work in any elementary class- room to initiate individual or group creative activity in order to accomplish the cogni- tive goals listed by the taxonomy. Huck and Kuhn also say that elementary students should be able to differentiate be- tween poetry and prose and to understand a host of characteristics of poetry that I could not begin to test my students for in my little book test. Again the little books give me some indication of students' work- ing knowledge of language. Many little books are written in verse, and I expect my students to comment on the poet's work and aims. Three of the many books in verse I have found seem worthy of further notice. Time for a Rhyme by Ellen Wilkie is a participation book that helps teach the con- cept of rhyme. On the first page, under a two-page spread picture of an apple tree, the question is printed: "Do you know a word / That rhymes with tree? / Turn the page / And you shall see." When the page is turned, a picture of a child appears on the left with the words, "It's Me, Me , Me!"; at the bottom appear more rhyming words: "Bee Key Knee Sea." On the right side, fac- ing page is a picture of a hat with the in- complete verse: "Can you think of a word / That rhymes with Hat? / I know a word; It is . . ." The reader is thus prompted to guess before turning the page to see if his or her word is either the pictured word ( "Cat" in this case) or another of the set at the bot- tom of the page ("Mat Bat Rat Fat"). With this same format throughout, eleven sets of rhyming words are included in this little Start-Right Elf Book published by Rand McNally. Another book in the same series is The Raggedy Goat and Other Verses. I expect my students to recognize it as a sort of baby anthology of poetry because it has five poems, all by different authors. Each poem can be discussed and evaluated according to criteria for judging poetry for children, and for one reason or another we find all five of these poems good. Classroom teach- ers might want to read them to children and then put the book in the classroom</page><page sequence="3">Instructional Uses for "Supermarket" Books 501 library to test whether children ask to have them read again. The third book is a rhyming ABC book, a happy little one, I Live in the City ABC, by Lou Moore. The city scenes, beginning with the two-page spread for the text "A is an Avenue with cars whizzing by," may delight real children as much as they obvi- ously do the pictured, integrated group of city children illustrated in this little book by Tom O'Sullivan for Whitman Publishing Company. Tom O'Sullivan has also drawn engaging pictures for two other little books, books that I hope my students will classify as realistic fiction because each in turn will help the elementary child to under- stand realistic fiction by comparing "char- acter and events with his or her knowledge to determine if a story could happen" and by looking "for evidence of modern life" (cf Huck and Kuhn's taxonomy). Both books, like many little books, have rather slight story lines, but enough to test whether my students discern the difference between fiction and nonfiction informational books. For example, Pals by Mellissa Dow Funk is about a day in the lives of two little boys who live next door to each other. As their experiences unfold in the story, a young reader or listener learns along with the two characters the linguistic fact that the same substance or experience (the referent) may have more than one name (linguistic sym- bol). Tommys family uses the words "por- ridge," "nightshirt," "nursery," "biscuit," and "chums" for what Jeremy calls respectively "cereal," "sleepers," "bedroom," "crackers," and "pals." At the end of the day Jeremy says to his mother, "Chums- pals, pals- chums, iťs all really just the same. Mother, aren't you glad there isn't any fence, or gate, or anything between Tommy's steps and mine?" and so the story has a theme, as well as characters and a setting, all sup- plied by both text and pictures working together. The Hiding Place by Pauline Palmer Meek also has the qualities of a good pic- ture storybook in that the text and pictures complement each other. The text tells about Henry, who isn't happy about having to move and leave his hidey-hole where he secretly keeps "two marbles, a shiny rock, an old ball-point pen, and a stick of gum." But he does move and he finds advantages in the new place to replace some he lost; he doesn't have the fire escape he used to climb, but he can lean out of his window and "almost touch the leaves of a tree." Best of all, he shares the precious possessions he used to hide with a new friend, who in turn shares his secret hiding place with Henry: "There! Henry's things were safe in the new hidey-hole. And no one knew about it except Henry and the boy. It was their very own place, and no one else in the whole world knew it was there." The illustrations by Tom O'Sullivan add more information. Henry is a little black boy whose family is obviously moving away from the crowded ghetto surroundings pic- tured in the first pages to a larger home in an integrated neighborhood in the city. The new friend is a little white boy. Easier to identify as fiction is the modern fantasy , written by an author named on the title page, but in the spirit of the folk tale in which animals talk and sometimes inter- act with humans. The best books in this category have become classics in juvenile fiction that adults delight in reading aloud to children- from Lewis Carroll's Alice to E. B. White's Charlotte's Web. Indeed, it seems that a good read-aloud book must appeal in one way to the child and in an- other to an adult, with some middle ground they can enjoy together. So far, I have found only one of the little books that fits my criteria for a good read-aloud fantasy: Cousin Matilda and the Foolish Wolf by Joanna Cole. The end pages are two-page</page><page sequence="4">502 Elementary English spreads showing Cousin Matilda, a plump, smiling little lady, sitting before the fire in her comfortable living room; her feet are up, and while she reads, her little berib- boned cat sleeps curled up on the round rug before the hearth. Through the win- dow however, can be seen the wolf lurking outside- a wolf clad in clothes, including a top hat. The beginning of the story and the first two pages introduce us to the out- side of Cousin Matilda's home. The plot thickens as we learn that the foolish wolf lives in the same town and is something to fear. The action consists of four encounters between Cousin Matilda and the foolish wolf. Each time the wolf knocks at her door to ask if she is at home, Cousin Ma- tilda answers that she is not and tells him where she may be found. In each encoun- ter, at this point, the wolf says, "Aha, you are very foolish to tell me that." The page is then turned to a two-page spread, with no text, in which the pictured scene reveals the predicaments the foolish wolf gets into looking for Cousin Matilda in the pond, in the berry patch, and up on the roof. In the last encounter a sad and dazed wolf hears Cousin Matilda say that she is now visiting the grizzly bear in his cave, who "is telling me how he chases foolish wolves home to bed where they belong." Com- pletely foiled, the wolf exchanges "good nights" with her. The last lines can be savored, perhaps for different reasons, by all: "But just to be safe, she went down- stairs and put a chair in front of the door. Because, as Cousin Matilda always said, a foolish wolf is still a wolf." Finally, I have found some little books that exemplify qualities of the good non- fictional , informational books for children, those that do not mix in elements of fantasy such as the anthropomorphism appropriate in the fiction and fantasy of Cousin Matilda and the Foolish Wolf. For example, Tall Tree, Small Tree by Mabel Watts, in the Tell-A-Tale series, is the same type of con- cept picture book as A Tree Is Nice by Janice Udry, well known because the illus- trations by Marc Simont won the 1957 Caldecott Medal. A second good, little in- formational book uses pictures and text to give several examples each of "hibernation," "protective coloration," and "migration." These terms are the only difficult words in the book and are introduced by title, Ani- mal Mysteries. The pictures by Carl and Mary Hague realistically present the ani- mals and their habitats, and the text by Dr. Lester E. Fisher does so objectively. It does not take long to review these little books, either in my test or in the store before buying them. Therefore, any adult can make a collection for young children that will be both inexpensive and "good" from the present critical theory about chil- dren's books. The only test left to make is to try them out on children!</page></plain_text>
