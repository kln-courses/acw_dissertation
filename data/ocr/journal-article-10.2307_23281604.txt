<plain_text><page sequence="1">[RA 93-1999] 107 THE MESSENGER, LULIL AND THE CULT OF THE DEAD BY DINA KATZ Funerary ri tuai is the epitome of the belief that death is but a transitional phase and that human existence continues in the netherworld. In principle, the idea is quite simple; the living human being is composed of the body and the soul which is the breath that animates it. After death the body is interred, and left to perish while the soul continues its life as a spirit in the netherworld.1 Since the spirit is merely a transformation of the living soul it also retains the needs and characteristics of a living human being. It also has the ability to influence the interests of its living kinsmen for better or for worse, depending on the quality of its sustenance in the netherworld.2 The realm of the dead, however, is 1. According to Atra-hasîs I: 215 the spirit—etemmu is the product of the godly material in the construction of mankind. This explains the immortality of the soul and its survival in the realm of the dead. Whether the fïrst millennium text simply reflects contemporary ontological spéculation or retains an older Sumerian concept is debatable. In two partly preserved myths of création, "The hymn of the hoe" and "The Eridu Genesis", mankind seems to have sprouted as végétation. The myth "Enki and Ninmah" is closer to the first millennium idea of Atra-hasïs in so far that mankind was fashioned from clay (for the three Sumerian compositions see W.W. Hallo [éd.], The context of Scripture, Leiden, 1997. 1.157-1.159 [resp.], pp. 509-518 with previous literature). One may also argue that the animation of the clay after nine months pregnancy in the womb of the birth goddess suggests a belief in a godly component within the human being. However, the various mythical explanations of the création of mankind suggest that there was no single accepted concept on the issue. It seems more likely, therefore, that the idea of nine months pregnancy merely mirrors the human experience of birth with no ontological connotation at ail, and that the concept of Atra-hasîs is really a later philosophical development which was not shared by the Sumerians. The dichotomy of body and soul probably originates in the simple link between the need to explain enigmatic or inauspicious events and the observation that the dead do not breath. This link is demonstrated by the use of the word im—"wind" to designate the spirit which leaves the body, and that wind, the breath, marks the diffé rence between the human being and its clay image. The ethereal, abstract form of the spirit makes it a perfect source of inexplicable circumstances. 2. The textual evidence, in particular the incantation literature and lists of ki-a-nag offerings, attest that the dead had to receive food and drink on a regular basis and probably also clothes. This evidence is confirmed by archaeological fïnds of victuals and other material goods deposited in graves. For an updated général survey of the cuit of the ancestors in Mesopotamia (mainly based on material of the second and the first millenniums) see K. van der Toorn, Family Religion in Revue d'Assyriologie, volume XCIII, p. 107 à 118, 2/1999</page><page sequence="2">108 DINA KATZ [RA 93 devoid of any means of sustenance. Thus, the dead and the living were interdependent and mutually bénéficiai; the spirits relied on the support of their living kinsmen as much as the living relatives depended on their dead ancestors for their own well being. In addition, since the family unit and lineage were of major social significance, the spirits of dead ancestors remained part of the family for générations. This notwithstanding, the Sumerians were also conscious of the fact that nothing remains of the dead but his bones and, therefore, that the perceptible reality is not fully consistent with a belief in survival in the netherworld. Some scepticism seems to be reflected by the dialogue between the spirit of Enkidu and Gilgames in Gilgames Enkidu and the Netherworld; first Enkidu warns Gilgames that his own body was eaten by worms and that knowledge of the nature of the netherworld would make him cry (GEN: 248 254). Nevertheless, he described the spirits as leading an active and sometimes good life as if they were still alive (GEN: 255-end). Then why warn and why mourn?3 It seems to me that the same scepticism is echoed by proverb no. 1.38.4 The text shows striking simila rities to the texts of the funerary rituals which we shall discuss below. Yet, through slight changes, the saying seems to challenge the cultic practice: the bread is given, but contrary to the ritual it instructs not wipe with it, water is poured but it is drunk by the ground where it disappears. Thus, the saying concludes, in the barren netherworld this is the offering for the dead. Since the saying intentionally contradicts the ritual, its conclusion seems to carry some scepticism, if not ironie overtone concerning the feeding of the dead. Considering that the belief in the survival of the spirit and its cultic manifestation are based on conflicting types of reality, metaphysical and concrete, différent attitudes are not unexpected. In practice, the cuit of the dead should be coherent with the concept that the spirits résidé in the netherworld where they receive their provisions and with the human experience that the dead perish in the grave. The spirit, however, is intrinsically an invisible ethereal entity. Even if it is visualised as wind—im, which imbues it with a concrete and tangible quality, in essence the spirit is abstract and by feeding it with real food and drink the cuit of the dead proposes a combination of metaphysical and mundane actual realities. Thus the very concrete nature of the cuit seems inharmonious with the Babylonia, Syria and Israël. Continuity and Change in the Forms of Religious Life, Leiden, 1996, pp. 42-65. For a compre hensive and systematic analysis of burial customs from the flfth to the third millennium see D. Forest, Les pratiques funéraires en Mésopotamie du Ve millénaire au début du IIIe. Étude de cas, Paris, 1983. The Ur III composition "The death of Urnammu" implies that some of the grave goods were meant as an offering to the netherworld gods. 3. The optimistic description of the netherworld according to GEN is probably due to the purpose of the composition and not necessarily an accurate reflection of the common concept. Therefore, Enkidu's warning at the beginning of the dialogue is probably more indicative than the specific descriptions of the spirits. It implies that the prospects in the nether world were actually gloomy. 4. B. Alster, Proverbs of Ancient Sumer (Bethesda, 1997), p. 13.</page><page sequence="3">1999] THE MESSENGER, LULIL AND THE CULT OF THE DEAD 109 belief on which it is based. Conceptually, therefore, the cultic manifestations of the belief in the survival of the spirit is rather intricate. The interment of the perishable body was made complété by a funerary ritual which actualised the transition from the world of the living to the realm of the dead and aimed at initiating its life anew in the form of spirit. Thereafter, a ritual to commemorate the dead would be performed periodically. The knowledge that the body is doomed to perish, contrasted with the abstract essence of the spirit, and the concrete form of its care creates tension between the concrete and the abstract realities. This tension called for a means to bridge the two conflicting realities. It seems that the obvious solution was to employ an icon of the dead for this purpose. By introducing a concrete element to represent the deceased, the abstract spirit received a concrete form and thereby the breach between the belief in its survival and the perceptible reality can be bridged and the tension mitigated. Two Sumerian laments include a detailed account of a ritual for the dead, "La passion du dieu Lillu"5 and "The messenger and the maiden" (partly duplicated in TIM 9, 15:l'-6')6. The rituals do not duplicate but comprise similar components and thus they complément and support one another. Jointly, the two sources give us a chance to study the actual manifestation of the belief in survival after death. The accounts strongly suggest that the deceased was represented by a figurine.7 5. Thureau-Dangin, RA, 19 (1922), 175-184. The text is a lament of Egime for her brother, a typical motive of the laments about young dying gods. The composition is built as a dialogue between the sister and brother. Egime describes the grief that his death caused and asks her brother to revive. In his answer the dead brother asks his sister to release him, namely his soul, describes his whereabouts in the netherworld and gives her instructions for the performance of his funerary ritual. The dead young god is the son of Ninhursaga and Sulpae in Adab and Kes. His name, mu-lu-lil which is Emesal for lu-lil raises the question of whether it relates to the deity Lillu (as Thureau-Dangin) or is a pun on that name and should be read literally Lulil (as Jacobsen). The latter may be interpreted as man-spirit and thus would qualify any spirit of the dead which would also endow the lament with a général character. For Lillu see RIA, Bd. 7, pp. 19-20, s.v. Lil, with previous literature. For a translation of lines 20-38 and 41-48, see Jacobsen, "Death in Mesopotamia", in B. Alster (éd.), Death in Mesopotamia (Copenhagen, 1980), pp. 21-22 (CRRAI XXVIe). Thureau-Dangin dates the text to the Isin-Larsa period. 6. S. N. Kramer, "The GIR5 and the ki-sikil: A New Sumerian Elegy", in M. de Jong (éd.), Essays on the Ancient Near East in Memory of J. J. Finkelstein (Hamden, 1977), pp. 139-142 (henceforth: Kramer, 1977); B. Alster, "Edin-na u-sag-gâ: Reconstruction, History and Interprétation of a Sumerian Lament", in K. Hecker and W. Sommerfeld (eds.), Keilschrif tliche Literaturen (Berlin, 1986), pp. 19-31 (CRRAI XXXIIe, henceforth: Alster, 1986). The text recounts in détail a funerary ritual which was performed by a young woman. Neither the dead nor the woman are mentioned by name, he is called kas4—messenger and she is ki-sikil—a girl. The refrain from using spécifié names endows the composition with the air of ambiguity. Perhaps it was composed as a général model for the performance of funerary ritual for a young man. Note, however, that the man is not called gurus either. The short version of the same ritual précédés a lament for Dumuzi, TIM 9, pl. X-XI, no. 15:1-6 and Alster, 1986 (this text includes also a part of Edina-usagake). The almost complété source dates to the OB period. 7. Some other sources suggest the use of only a chair to represent the dead. Symbolically, this too is a tangible element that can serve to mediate between the spirit and its provisions not, however, as explicitly as an icon. Offerings to the throne of dead kings of Ur are recorded for instance in UET 3, 74 (ki-a-nag of Urnammu); PDTI, 417 (for the throne of Sulgi in Nippur) and see W. Sallaberger, Der kultische Kalender der Ur III Zeit (Berlin,1993), Bd. I, pp. 147-148 with no. 696.

I wish to thank B. Jagersma for collating the tablet. In TIM 9, 15:9' which repeats 15:6" Alster reads BALAG, but his reading is doubtful. Kramer reads tun (HÛB), to be read tu^Q, however, a verb su...tujQ does not occur in any source. Moreover, while the verb tu^Q is usually intransitive, in compound verbs such as sag...tujQ it appears as transitive active, see references in Kracher, Kultlyrik, p. 106. Therefore, a compound verb su...tu^Q is probably unsuitable in this context. Considering the nature of the ritual and the place of this statement at its conclusion, I assume that it describes the spirit of the dead messenger, not the circumstances of his death, and therefore I suggest the reading hub in su...hub-sâru-"to whirl". Compare Erimhus 11:244, MSL 17, p. 40 and "The home of the fish", line 89, Civil, Iraq 23 (1961), 163. 10. This seemingly contradictory statement implies that the messenger did arrive but not in person and therefore through an emissary. This particular phrasing may account for the use of the appellation "messenger". 11. The two phrases in lines 39-40 indicate that the girl is referring to an actual anthropomorphic entity.</page><page sequence="5">1999] THE MESSENGER, LULIL AND THE CULT OF THE DEAD 111 42.

Civil, AOS 67 (1987), pp. 52-54. See also CAD K, p. 178 ff. s.v. kapâru, especially the lexical section with examples for ritualistic wiping of the body with bread. These examples suggest that here too the bread was used for wiping the body of the subject of the ritual. Proverb 1.38 (see note 4) paraphrases this line making a point not to wipe with the bread. The intentionally negated form of the verb su... gur implies that the common practice was indeed to wipe with the bread and thereby points to the use of an anthropomorphic entity. My impression is, however, that the saying challenges the ritual and thereby the practice of feeding the dead. 13. ma-al-tum—bowl is an Akkadian loan word in Sumerian (CAD M/1, 172). The syntactic relation between it and utul which also means bowl (Akkadian diqâru) is unclear. Since both words have a similar meaning perhaps it is merely a répétition to specify more clearly the type of container which was used in the ritual. At the same time, in analogy with "La passion du dieu Lillu" line 60 in which I interpret utul ummaru—"soup" it may also mean "from a soup bowl". The reading kesda (Kramer read al) is suggested after collation and, thus, from a literary point of view line 43 stands in synonymie paral lelism with line 44. Both lines are subordinate to the main clause in line 45. 14. Compare with "La passion du dieu Lillu" line 59: sahar-kur-ra dé-bi. The version ki has double meaning, "nether world" as a parallel to kur in the ritual for Lulil or "earth", "ground". In the ritual to Lulil the water was explicitly poured into the water pipes a-pa4 which indicates that the ritual was performed in association with a grave. That no pipes are mentioned here may indicate that the girl did not perform the ritual in connection with a grave. Proverb 1.38 confirais the meaning "ground" but in light of the negated form of the verb su...gur and the form ki-in-DU it seems that it is the ground which drinks the water, not the spirit. Whether this impression is correct or not, the proverb clearly refers to a ritual without an icon of the dead. 15. The translation é-garg = igâru "wall" (Kramer, 1977 and Alster, 1986, p. 30) does not make any sense. lànu—"shape", "figure", however, seems more suitable (that é-garg means also "body" was actually pointed out by Kramer, 1977, note 37). Almost every détail in the ritual suggests that the performance of the ritual engaged an anthropo morphic form; in lines 38-40 we are informed that the dead is coming and that he has eyes and a mouth although he can neither see nor speak, the girl anointed him with oil and gave him a clean garment. These concrete features are not appli cable to a spiritual, abstract entity and thus enforce the impression of anthropomorphic object and overrule the possibility that these acts were performed on a wall. The term é-garg, however, suggests that it is a figurine not a corpse, and compare "La passion du dieu Lillu" line 56. The use of é-garg rather than the obvious term alam is puzzling. I would venture to suggest that the text indeed meant literally "shape" of the spirit. In practice, the concept of "shape" would be materialised in a figurine. Conceptually, however, alam-"fïgurine" is not identical with "shape" and, therefore, it is less suitable. 16. Compare with "La passion du dieu Lillu" line 57. 17. Compare with "La passion du dieu Lillu" line 55. Note, however, the différence! In the ritual for Lulil the spirit is merely released whereas here it first had to enter and then it departed. It seems to me that this line marks the cardinal diffé rence between the two rituals: Lulil's is a burial ritual while the messenger's ritual is not related to a funeral either in space or in time. 18. In view of TIM 9, 15:6' where we have kur-sà-ga, kur-sà-ba is analysed kur-sà(g)-b(i)-a, the inverted genitive with the possessive suffix for 3r&lt;* sg. inan., "in its midst".</page><page sequence="6">112 DINA KATZ [RA 93 1 .b.

Compare with "The messenger and the maiden" line 39. 20. The context, and especially in view of the reference to a figure in "The messenger and the maiden" line 46, suggests that si-la-ah is a représentation of the dead person. Neither si-la-ah nor si-im-la-ah (in the following line) are known in Sumerian or Akkadian and, therefore, I assume that it is the Elamite word si-i-la, meaning "statue", see W. Hinz und H. Koch, Elamisches Wôrterbuch (Berlin, 1987), Teil III, p. 1072. Judging by the context I assume that both lines should have the same word and that si-im-la-ah in line 57 is a mistake. Grammatical or syntactical reasons do not justify the suffïx /-h/ or /-ah/ and therefore I suppose that the scribe heard the word as "silah" and as such he borrowed it. Why the scribe did not use Sumerian but employed an Elamite word for statue is not clear to me. 21. See CAD E, p. 28, s.v. edëpu (a différent translation). Compare with "The messenger and the maiden" line 48. Since, however, the ritual begins with the release of the spirit and a bed has to be brought for Lulil I conclude that the body is in front of the mourner and, therefore, Lulil's is clearly a funerary rite on the occasion of the interment of the body. 22.

The objective OF the rituals A close reading of the two rituals reveals that each phase in the one has its parallel in the other; the purpose of both is to grant the spirit of the dead rest in the netherworld and, therefore, it is practically one spécifié ritual. Yet, a slight disparity in two parallel phases suggests that in addition to the literary form of the accounts, there is also a différence in the circumstances of the performance. The ritual for the messenger begins with, "he cornes yet he has not corne" and ends with the statement, "the spirit has entered the spirit has departed" while the instruc tions of Lulil begin with "after you have called my 'his spirit is released' fetch me the bed!". In principle both relate to the movements of the spirit and its departure to the netherworld. Three différences in the phrasing, however, imply a major différence in the situation: 1) The ritual of Lulil commences with the release of the spirit from the body and the ritual of the messenger begins with his arrivai at the place of the girl. This point is empha sised in line 48 which summarises the movements of the spirit of the messenger and signifies that it had to enter before he departed to the netherworld. Its dual movement in two opposite directions implies that neither the dead body nor the spirit were present on the scene of the ritual before it began and, therefore, that the ritual for the messenger was not on the occasion of the burial but at a later period. 2) In the ritual for the messenger a bed is not mentioned while Lulil required a bed. The demand for a bed after the release of the spirit indicates that the body of Lulil was right there, ready and waiting for interment. Its absence from the ritual of the messenger implies that there was no body to be buried. 3) Each text employs a différent verb to signify the departure of the spirit to the netherworld: the messenger's went out-è whereas the spirit of Lulil was released—(su-)bar. The choice of these particular verbs conforms with the différent circumstances; Lulil's 24. Compare with "The messenger and the maiden" line 42 and note 12: "I plaeed bread and wiped it". gur-bi su-te ma-ab in the second member of line 58 is a corruption of the verb su...gur-kapàru "to wipe" "to rub" etc. This form appears also in line 55 which is perhaps the source of the mistake. For ki-sï-ga see Lambert, Or.NS 56 (1985), pp. 403-404. 25. Compare with "The messenger and the maiden" line 45. 26. This line remains enigmatic. Since utul relates to the verb bal it seems that the meaning immaru'— "soup" is more suitable than diqâru—"bowl".</page><page sequence="8">114 DINA KATZ [RA 93 spirit is released because it is still in his body while the messenger's spirit was already outside the body, it came for the ritual and left afterwards. ku4-"to enter" signifies perhaps that the spirit entered the figurine, not merely the place of the ritual. The second passage in which the rituals differ is the act of libating the offering to the dead. Lulil instructed his sister to pour the water to the libation pipes which indicates that it was performed in connection with a grave27: "Pour out the water to the libation pipe, pour it in the dust of the netherworld!" The girl, on the other hand, plainly pours the water for the messenger to the ground: "I poured water, I poured to the ground, he drank it." This act too seems to signify a différent situation and not merely a variation in phrasing. To sum up this issue, both rituals illustrate the cuit of the dead, to secure the rest and well-being of the spirit in the netherworld. However, the disparity in wording indicates différent circumstances pertaining to the time and place of their performance. Lulil's ritual is the initial funerary rite, immediately following the death and associated with the interment of the body; the messenger's ritual was performed at later stage and is unrelated to a grave as in ki-a-nag.28 3. The significance of the rituals The interesting feature in both rituals is the use of a figurine as a représentative of the dead person. That the Elamite word "si-i-la" means statue was probably unknown to Thureau-Dangin.2q Kramer and Alster who treated the text of "The messenger and the maiden" preferred to render é-garjj "wall" not "shape" or "figure". The presence of a figurine adds clarity to the acts of placing a chair, putting a garment on it and, above ail, to the acts of anointing and wiping with bread. Thus, it seems that an image of the dead person was placed on a chair, donned with a garment,30 anointed and offered bread and 27. Note that Enegi, the cuit centre of Ninazu, is called in the hymn to its principal temple Egida a-pa4-gal a-pa4~ki-a deres-ki-gal-la-ka, that is the great offering pipe of the netherworld (Sjôberg, TCS III, p. 27:179). See also CAD A/2, p. 324 s.v. arûtu. For concrete evidence see, for example, the royal cemetery of Ur where pipes were found in the fïlling layers of some graves such as PG 800 (Woolley, UE II, pp. 73-91); PG 1054 (ibid., pp. 97-107); PG 1237 (ibid., 113-124). It seems reasonable to assume that these pipes were intended for offerings after burial and that they are the same as the a-pa4 of this ritual. 28. Compare with an Old Babylonian prayer to Sîn asking him to release the spirits of the family for the kispum, BE 6/2, 111:1-36; C. Wilcke, ZA 73 (1983), pp. 48-54. See also van Soldt, AbB 13, 21 which reports about a father that during eight years made kispu for his son who disappeared and now was discovered alive. 29. See note 20 above. Judging by the context, though, he proposed that it was a double of the dead. 30. That in both rituals the spirit was given a garment supports my view that the dead were supposed to remain dressed in the netherworld and that only Inanna was compelled to undress on her way to the netherworld for reasons that relate to the particular plot of Inanna9s Descent. Therefore we should not deduce a général rule from the circumstances of this myth. See Katz, ZA 85 (1995), 221-233.</page><page sequence="9">1999] THE MESSENGER, LULIL AND THE CULT OF THE DEAD 115 water. The use of a figurine as a proxy for the dead man can also explain the graphie description of the messenger in lines 39-40 and may account for the impersonal appel lation kas4-"messenger".31 A vivid illustration of this practice, although of a later date, is the account of the mourning and funerary rites which Gilgames set for Enkidu, in the Epie of Gilgames tablet VIII. After a long lament over Enkidu32 Gilgames commissioned the erecting of his statue and promises that (iii: 1-2): "[I will lay you] on a bed [of loving care'] / I will make you sit [in a restful seat33, the seat of the left]". The fragmentary remains of the tablet seem to describe the funerary ritual as performed for Enkidu, apparently in front of Samas, with an account of the grave goods and the provisions that Gilgames offered to Enkidu. Since the version of the Gilgames epic is much later than our texts and of a différent literary genre it includes détails which are either a later practice or are irrelevant for the Sumerian lament and ritual.34 In principle, however, the account of tablet VIII parallels that of "La passion du dieu Lillu" and contains the same cardinal elements: lament, making a statue of the dead, setting a bed and a chair for him and finally making the offerings.35 Another passage from the epic of Gilgames relates that Gilgames offered "his god" Lugalbanda an ointment in the horns of the Bull of Heaven which he then hung in his bedroom (Gilg. VL161-162)36. Lugalbanda is the father of Gilgames and his désignation "his god" points to the cuit of the ancestors. The offering of ointment suggests that Gilgames venerated a statue of Lugalbanda. The two examples from the epic of Gilgames establish that the cuit of the dead was practised in association with an icon of the dead.3, The references to a figurine in "The messenger and the maiden" and "La passion du dieu Lillu" imply that the use of an icon 31. It is plausible, however, that "messenger" désignâtes the unity of physical shape and spirit. 32. The translation is according to Dalley, Mythsfrom Mesopotamia, 1989, pp. 91-95 with minor modifications. Note also VIII, ii:14-17: "Now, what is the sleep that has taken hold of you? / Turn to me, you, you aren't listening to me! / but he cannot lift his head. I touch his heart, but it does not beat at ail" and compare with "La passion du dieu Lillu" line 43 and "The messenger and the maiden" lines 39-40. 33. In view of the two OB rituals it seems that subtu here is not dwelling but a chair. 34. Such as the detailed account of grave goods for taklimtu in front of Samas or even the very involvement of Samas in the funerary ri tuai which is self e vident for the first millennium but being undocumented practice in the Ur III period it probably originated some time during the OB period. 35. Note that a similar funerary ritual is described in an incantation against disease AMT 90 ii:8 ff. (and A. Tsukimoto, Untersuchungen zut Totenpjlege (kispum) im alten Mesopotamien (Neukirchen, 1985), AOAT 216, p. 138 and note 468). However, in the incantation it is of course the figurine which was buried since it represents the evil power not a dead man. Yet, the similarities to our Old Babylonian rituals signify that burial customs were so firmly rooted in the Mesopotamian tradition that they were observed in about the same manner for hundreds of years. 36. K 231 = v: 24-25. 37. The use of a figurine in connection with kispu is implied by a Middle Babylonian text PBS 2/2, 108:5; Tsukimoto, op. cit. p. 87. A text from Elam alludes to the same practice in Susa, see E. Reiner, AFO 24 (1973), 87-102. It seems remar kable that so few texts describe the ritual and even less mention figurines while so many texts document the commodities for ki-a-nag. This state of affairs is probably due to the fact that the delivery of commodities is of economic importance and as such was usually recorded.</page><page sequence="10">116 DINA KATZ [RA 93 originated earlier, in Sumerian traditions. The duplicate in TIM 9, 15:l'-9' suggests that such a ritual was performed in the cuit of Dumuzi. The replacement of the appellation ka§4—"messenger" by Dumuzi's epithets in TIM 9, 15:7'-9' indicates équivalence in terms and suggests that the désignation "messenger" is functional and refers to a proxy of the dead, at least in later commémoration rites for spirits which résidé in the netherworld. Correspondingly we may wonder whether "lu-lil" refers to the deity Lillu, as rendered by Thureau-Dangin, or if it is an appellation similar to "messenger", meaning "man-spirit" and refers to the object of the ritual. 4. WHO WAS THE MESSENGER ? Kramer proposed that "The messenger and the maiden" evolves around a man who died far away from home (Kramer, 1977, p. 139).38 The introduction to the ritual, announcing the coming of the messenger from far away and describing the predicament of the dead man, clearly indicates that the girl was not beside him and that the dead is coming from a distant place. The highly literary style of the narrator's speech can indeed be inter preted as a description of the actual remote area where the messenger died and the long path his spirit traversed. However, it can also be a fïctional, metaphorical description of the journey that the spirit made from the netherworld to the location of the ritual. Equally ambiguous is the final phrase of the composition, line 49: "My messenger in the kur; In the midst of the kur..." because "kur" signifies both mountain and netherworld.39 Against that background there are two equally possible alternative objectives for the ritual; either it was, indeed, for a man who was killed far away from home and was not properly buried or, it describes a periodic ritual for a spirit which already resides in the netherworld and comes out to receive the offerings as for ki-a-nag. Since the text itself is ambiguous we should first consider the two possibilities in light of its duplicate and then according to the theme of the composition. TIM 9, 15:l'-9' constitutes the first section of the tablet with a séparation line after 9'. Lines l'-6' duplicate part of the ritual for the messenger and line 6' parallels line 49 which is the closing statement of the girl.40 38. Kramer's interprétation of the ritual for the messenger is indirectly supported by the Old Babylonian letter, van Soldt, AbB 13, 21. This letter reports that for eight years a father made funerary offerings for his son who disappeared and now was found alive. Apparently, the cuit of the dead was performed also when the circumstances of death and the burial place were unknown. In the case of this letter neither were even established. 39. Kramer translated "My 'GIRj' was struck down in the mountain, in the heart of the mountain, (and now) he lies (dead)". 40. The omitted lines are 43-44 which specify the dishes for the liquid libation and lines 46-48 about anointing the figure, dressing it with a new garment and the statement that the spirit entered and departed. The significance of these omissions is not certain. The text clearly includes the most important elements of the ritual, the bread and the water offerings and, therefore, one may assume that the omitted elements are the less important components for the sustenance of the spirit. Since, on the other hand, it is a school tablet it does not necessarily dictate the précisé cultic practice.</page><page sequence="11">1999] THE MESSENGER, LULIL AND THE CULT OF THE DEAD 117 Lines 7'-9', each beginning with an epithet of Dumuzi, convey a lament over him and thereby they continue the notion of line 6'. Line 9' which ends this section is a répétition of line 6' but the appellation "messenger" is replaced by gurus sug-ba-mu—"lad, my shepherd". Thus, the messenger is identifïed as Dumuzi and the lament over Dumuzi appears to be an intégral part of the ritual.41 Evidently, TIM 9, 15 associâtes this ritual with the cuit of Dumuzi. In analogy with Dumuzi's cuit, therefore, the ritual for the messenger was performed periodically and the spirit came from the netherworld. Now we can turn back to the concluding statement and consider its thematic relation to the context. The composition is focused solely on the ritual, from the first lines which announce the approach of the messenger, through the préparations up to the completion of the ritual. Line 48 summarises the event after it has ended by stating that the spirit has entered and departed. The possibility that kur signifies "mountain" implies that thematically, the final phrase of the composition deals with the deceased himself, the circumstances of his death and the position of his body. Chronologically, it points to the situation before the ritual was intended. Therefore, this meaning is beyond the framework of the theme, although the phrase conveys a mood of lament. The alternative possibility, that kur is the name "netherworld", implies that the final phrase of the composition describes the lamentable situation of the spirit immediately before and after the ritual. Thus, it pertains to the contents of the text both chronologically and thematically; it coalesces with the previous statement that the spirit has entered and departed and forms a framework to the composition. Therefore, I propose that the final phrase attests that the messenger is a spirit in the netherworld. In light of TIM 9, 15:l'-9' the ritual seems to correspond with the cuit of Dumuzi. Since, however, the text désignâtes the participants with the général appellations "messenger" and "girl" but avoids the term "gurus", I suppose that it was intended for any young man. 5. Conclusions The texts clearly attest to the use of a figurine in the funerary ritual. It stands to reason that rather than dealing with an abstract spiritual being, a physical, figurative représentation of the dead was used for the cuit of the ancestors, signifying his actual presence in the house and his participation in family affairs. The statue kept his memory alive and thereby his identity as well as the identity of the family. With a physical image of the dead the cuit could be conducted everywhere.42 How common the use of figurines in 41. The rest of the text is a lament over Dumuzi which has parallels in Edina-usagake. 42. An illuminating illustration for the significance of the ancestors' figurines is found in the Biblical story about Rachel stealing the Teraphim (Genesis 31:19). For a detailed discussion see van der Toorn, op.cit., pp. 218-224.</page><page sequence="12">118 DINA KATZ [RA 93-1999] the cuit of the dead was, is a matter for systematic archaeological research and is beyond the scope of this article. A mere glimpse at the finds from Nippur reveals that figurines were found in every private house (although not in a particular room).43 The fact that most of these figurines were made of baked clay indicates that they were meant to be used for a long period of time, and that many were made by means of a mould suggests that it was mass production. For these reasons, above ail other possible uses of figurines, the excavators prefer household private religion.44 Gilg. VL161-162 suggests that the statue of his father Lugalbanda was placed in the bedroom of Gilgames; it is at least equally possible, therefore, that these figurines represented the ancestors and were used for their cuit and perhaps the dead ancestors were the private gods of the family.45 However, although in theory every family was supposed to observe the cuit of the ancestors the number of figurines in the finds is relatively small, even if the same objects had been used for générations.46 Therefore, it is still to be decided whether the cuit of the dead as is illus trated by these rituals was practised by the whole population or merely by families of social and economic standing, and if those who could not set apart an area in the private house could revere their dead ancestors in a specially designated public area or in a temple.47 ABSTRACT "The messenger and the maiden" is an Old Babylonian Sumerian account of a ritual performed by a girl for her dead "messenger". That both the messenger and the girl are impersonal appellations strongly suggests that the purpose of the text was to describe the cuit of the dead in universal terms and, in a literary form. A description of funerary ritual appears also in the lament "La passion du dieu Lillu" of the same period. Apparently, the rituals evolved around a figurine. This raises the questions of what its function was; whether the use of a figurine was a common practice in the cuit of the dead, and whether "messenger" is actually a functional appellation. 43. Nippur I, OIP 78, pp. 83-95 and 146-147 about house chapels. 44. OIP 78, p. 95. Magical purposes were rejected for two reasons, fïrstly because towards the end of the second millennium the number of figurines in the fïnds déclinés while the number of magical texts using figurines increases; secondly the ephemeral use of a figurine for magical purposes does not justify baking. Non-stratigraphic digs in the Diqdiqqah "cemetery" at Ur yielded numerous figurines suggesting that it was the location of a workshop for figurines (Woolley and Mallowan, UE VII). 45. See the comprehensive discussion of van der Toorn, op.cit., p. 55 ff. 46. The évaluation of the archaeological finds in private houses calls for great caution, particularly with regard to figurines. It stands to reason that in the event of moving out of the house the family would also take the statues of their gods. Consequently, if a house was not destroyed suddenly but abandoned we should not expect to find figurines at ail, or at least not fully preserved figurines, just damaged ones that were out of use and put away. 47. In analogy to the practice of interment, either in private houses or in cemeteries, perhaps the cuit could also be observed at home or in a designated public place.</page></plain_text>
