<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEWLY DISCOVERED BUDDHIST SITES IN PRAKASAM DISTRICT - COASTAL ANDHRA V.V. Subha Reddy Ancient Andhradesha was a very important land for Buddhism and Buddhist culture. Famous Buddhist centres at Amaravati and Nagarjunakonda, in the present Guntur district, are well known to historians and scholars of Buddhist art and culture. But the fact that the neighbouring Prakasam district was also a great centre of Buddhist art and culture may look strange at first sight. The Prakasam district was approximately divided into two halves by the river Gundlakamma and its tributaries, flowing west to east. A large number of Buddhist sites came to light on the plains of the rivers and rivulets, in the recent explorations and excavations. Unfortunately these sites are totally ruined and bereft of the past glory and thereby failed to attract the historians and archaeologists till recent times. Nevertheless their discovery and location would unmistakably give an insight into the heritage of Buddhist art and architecture in the region, in the remote past. The plain of Gundlakamma was a ground of habitation right from the prehistoric times. No wonder, it continued to be a centre of cultural activity in the early centuries under the Buddhist stimulus. The region must have been under the influence of the famous Buddhist centres, Amaravati and Nagarjunakonda of the neighbouring Guntur district. Ruins of the two recently discovered Maha Chaityas , one at Chandavaram and the other at Dupadu, in addition to Pedaganjam, Kanuparti, Uppugundur and other known sites of the district prove the point. The present day Prakasam district was the region through which early trade routes traversed east to west and north to south. Thus the region was open to popular and cultural movements. A route from Vengi, Dhanyakataka and Cherolu enters the region, touching Malakonda, leading to the Tamil country. An inscription1 issued by a mercantile family of Aruvalakula , found in the Parvatiguha, in the Malakonda ranges, illustrates that it was a centre of trade and situated on a trade route. Other trade routes from north, west and east, must have been converging at Chandavaram, perhaps, via Dupadu leading to Banavasi in Karnataka. A glance at the Buddhist sites in the region reveals that most of them were located along these ancient highways.</page><page sequence="2">1438 IHC: Proceedings , 66th Session, 2005-06 The Coastal Andhra witnessed a great constructional activity of Buddhist stupas and viharas during the period from 3rd Century B.C. to 4lh Century A.D. The stupas and viharas were repositories of Buddhist art especially the plastic sculptural art. Inscriptions from Amaravati and Nagarjunakonda reveal that the Buddhist establishments received support largely from the merchants, artisans and common folk besides royal ladies. The merchants were prosperous, not only due to the internal trade but also of the sea-borne. Motupalle and Ramayapatnam in the district might have greatly contributed to the sea-borne trade with the far-east. The river Gundlakamma might have provided easy access to the Bay of Bengal for the sea-borne trade besides connecting many inland trading centres. The large number of Roman coins discovered at Ongole,2 Vinukonda,3 Dharmavaripalem4 in the region under study prove the fabulous profits the local merchants made out of their trade with the west. It is interesting to note that rouletted ware and Arratine red ware of Roman origin had been picked up at Mylavaram and Chandavaram5 and some other places in the district. The Buddhist centres and nearby towns were the consuming points of goods. Chandavaram, Dupadu, Chinaganjam, Malakonda etc., were the commercially active towns in the early centuries of Christian era in the region under study. Mention of merchants hailing from Dhanyakataka visiting Pedaganjam, Ghantasala etc., is notable.6 Motupalle (Lat. 15°44' Long. 80°17') a village situated 27 kilometre to the southwest of Bapatla is a well known ancient port which flourished almost from 2nd Century B.C. That it must have been in a prosperous condition during the reign of Satavahanas, Paliavas, Calukyas and Cholas can be easily surmised. There was a regular trade from this port to South East Asian countries, besides Ceylon, China, Japan, Rome, Greece and some other countries. Very near to this port, a township known as Velapuri or Dvelapuri is referred to as having been constructed by Buddhists.7 The royal families like the Satavahanas and Iksvakus are known to have patronized Buddhism. But more than that, it was a popular religion. At the same time, it has to be kept in mind that Brahmanical ritualism did not lose ground altogether. Several Satavahana kings performed Vedic rituals and claimed to be the champions of Vedic culture. Similarly, the Iksvaku king Camtamula was a performer of a number and variety of Brahmanical rituals and Camtamula II was a builder of many temples to Hindu gods. Iksvaku monarchs favoured the growth of Buddhism and Brahmanism simultaneously in their dominions.</page><page sequence="3">Archaeology 1439 The early phase of Buddhism, the Hinayana, was more an ethical code than a religion. It did not recognize the existence of god and thus it did not provide for an image of god for worship. Even the Buddhist Suttas declare that Tathagatas are not visible and thence they cannot be presented in anthropomorphic form. As such, the early sculptors at the stupa of Amaravati presented the Buddha by symbolic forms like th cBodhi tree or the Vriksha Caitya, Buddha-padas , the wheel and an empty throne etc. The idea behind the use of these symbols seems to be that the Buddha, in attaining enlightenment, had freed himself from all social and physical attachments. So it was regarded that it would be improper to present the Buddha in human form, from which he had gained his freedom.8 With the emergence of the Mahayana the anthropomorphic form of Buddha came, for the first time, some time during 2nd Century A.D. As mentioned above, the region now called Prakasam district did not lag behind in responding to the throbbing call of Buddhist philosophy. It was as well a great centre of Buddhist constructional activity and the extant Buddhist remains extending from Chinaganjam in north to Malakonda in the south, and as far west as Dupadu and Chandavaram in the district demonstrate the wide popularity enjoyed by Buddhism in the past. A number of sites, such as Ongole,9 Kanuparti,10 Uppugundur,11 Ramathirtham12 (Ongole Taluk), Vellala Cheruvu,13 Gopalapuram,14 Elchur,15 Kukatapalle or Kukatlapalli,16 Manikeshwaram,17 Konidena18 (Addanki Taluk), Muppalla19 (Kandukur taluk) and other less known sites, that spot all over the district are considered as definitely early historic and thus some of them should have had some chaitya , or stupa , even though such things are not reported so far. Buddhism being a popular religion in the early centuries of Christian era, lends support that the inhabitants must have had some arrangement for their spiritual and religious activity. It was the Mahayana form that appealed to the masses more and thus numerous stupas , chaityas and viharas came to be erected all over the country. Among these, very few sites are excavated and many sites are still to be excavated. The pattern of distribution of these sites show, villages and towns were flourishing with agriculturists and artisans and rich mercantile population, who must have patronized Buddhism and the Buddhist establishments. New Evidences K. Krishna Murty conducted thorough explorations recently in Addanki and Ongole taluks of the district in the river basin of Gundlakamma and brought to light several early historical and especially Buddhist</page><page sequence="4">1440 IHC : Proceedings , 66th Session , 2005-06 sites. Many sites yielded inscribed pottery and brick structures. Among them an extensive Buddhist site at Kukutlapalli (also spelt as Kukutapalle) (Addanki taluk) is important.20 At Mylavaram in Darsi taluk, the remains of a Buddhist stupa , a mound of 2 metre height, with brick structures has been discovered. Another Buddhist mound at Gopalapuram, 6 kilometre away from Addanki on the bank of Gundlakamma has also been noticed. Similar remains are noticed at Elchur, Vellalacheruvu and Konidena in Addanki taluk.21 The explorations brought to light another Mahayana Buddhist centre at Ramathirtham village near Chimakurti hills in Ongole taluk.22 Ramathirtham is probably the corrupt form of aramathirtham , which means, thirtham consisting of Buddhist aramas. While clearing the compound of Moksha Ramalingeshwara temple of Telugu Chola period at the place, ruins of a large sized brick construction have also been discovered together with an image of Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara (PL.l). The image was dated by the learned scholar to 2nd Century A.D. on stylistic grounds.23 The lime stone image of Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara is two handed and exuberantly ornamented. He is holding a lotus in his right hand, the stalk of which can be made out in his mutilated right hand. His left hand is resting on an ornamented mace. His Kiritamakuta , makarakundala, graiveyika , yajnopavita, udarabandha, sarpakeyura and Prakoshta valayas are quite impressive. He wears an antariya (&lt; dhoti ), the folds of which are clearly seen. The antariya is secured by means of a Kamarabandha (waist band), tassels of which can be seen slinging in the centre. That the idol is of early date (2nd Century A.D.) is confirmed by its saumya countenance, the absence of Amitabha in his crown, and the absence of Tara which are the characteristic appendages of the later Avalokiteshvara icons. Thus, Ramathirtham marks the presence of the earliest Mahayana Buddhist centre and so far the first known sculptural form of Avalokiteshvara in the country.24 I.K. Sharma compared the figure with similar Vajrayana images from Amaravati and Ghantasala and assigned it to 5lh-6th Century A.D.25 But, the Buddhist literature which presents the worship of Bodhisattvas cannot be found before 4th Century A.D. and thus, the prevalence of the practice at Ramathirtham, as early as 2nd Century A.D. is extremely doubtful. Secondly, in the absence of the essential Buddhist symbol Amitabha in his crown, makes it doubly doubtful, whether it was the image of a Bodhisattva at all. Among the ruins large size bricks, red polished ware, sprinklers (Dharmakarakas of the Cullavagga) and the</page><page sequence="5">Archaeology 1441 red ware bowls ( Thalikas of the Buddhist text) were unearthed. At Konidena, along the foot of the hill extending two to three kilometer an extensive site of early historic times has been noticed. The site yielded a 'torso* of Buddha in lime stone.26 A head of the Buddha figure discovered at Muppalla (Kandukur taluk) has been recently acquired by the site Museum, Kanuparti (PL.2). The figure has lost its nose and mouth. The image recalls the examples from Uppugundur and Nagarjunakonda. At Thaticherla in Giddalur taluk, a site yielding burnished grey ware and early historic pottery, and a mound with exposed brick structures probably forming part of a stupa have been noticed.27 It is quite interesting that we have a village Pitikaya Gulla near Cumbum in Giddalur taluk. P.V. Parabrahma Sastry, suggests that "It is actually Pitikala-gullu, where Buddhist Pitakas were studied. Temples with early architectural features are still seen there in a dilapidated condition.28 The stupa at Dupadu yielded two carved slabs.29 These slabs were made from a greenish yellow lime stone available locally in the quarries along the river Krishna in Palnadu in Guntur district, an adjacent area of Prakasam district. Slab No.l (BMG. 92-125) was recovered from the ayaka platform facing the northern entrance to the Pradakshinapatha (PL.3). It contains the model of a stupa . The slab is 1.72 metre in height, 0.99 metre wide and 0.12 metre in thickness. Th e medi portion of the stupa is divided into three sections. The central portion is occupied prominently by a vase. To the right side of the vase there is a throne surmounted by Bodhi-tree and to its left side a throne surmounted by dharmachakra . On either side of the top of the vase there are projections which may represent ayaka platforms on which a group of five ayaka pillars are seen. The drum is presented, as entwined by two three-hooded Nagas whose hoods come out behind the drum, on either side of the harmika. The harmika is in the form of inverted stepped pyramid. The top portion of the harmika has elongated Chhatras flowing in different directions and giving impression of Bodhi-tree . On either side of the stupa stands a devotee with folded hands. The central vase may be taken to stand for the relic casket and the three-hooded Nagas that entwine the stupa are in the posture of protecting it. Hence, this sculpture may be taken to represent the Ramagrama stupa. There is an inscription on the left top edge of the slab in Brahmi Characters, datable on palaeographical grounds to the later Satavahana period, i.e., 1st or 2nd Century A.D. It is not yet deciphered but five</page><page sequence="6">1442 IHC: Proceedings , 66th Session , 2005-06 letters can be possibly made out, reading as Sa ma..nikaya. There is the likelihood of a few more letters engraved on the slab, but lost due to its damaged condition. The letters that can be made out at present do not give proper idea. Possibly they may stand for some personal name, may be of the donor. Slab No. 2 (BMG. 92-126) has been unearthed from the ay aka platform just facing the western entrance to the Pradakshinapatha (PL.3). It is more exquisitely carved than the other, especially in representing the stupa. The slab measures 1 .63 metre x 1 . 1 8 metre x 0. 1 8 metre. The medhi portion contains three important events in the life of Buddha. On the central portion a horse coming out of a gate way, is presented, symbolizing Mahabhinishkramana . To its left side is a throne surmounted by the tree symbolizing Sambodhi , the enlightenment. On the right side is a stupa on a pedestal representing the Mahaparinirvana. The representations of these events are separated by four vertical thabos or upright posts of railing pattern with the lotus designs and half-Ictus motifs at both ends and in the centre. The harmika is like an inverted stepped pyramid. Above it, there are ornamented chhatras flowing in different directions and giving the impression of bodhi- tree. The top of the anda just below the harmika there are two rows of beaded garlands. The anda proper is decorated with garlands with pendents. The garlands are arranged as crossing each other at centre. One devotee stands on either side of the stupa with upraised folded hands. One of them on the right side of the stupa seems to be a lady. She seems to carry a garland in her folded hands as if she was about to offer in worship of the stupa. Below the stupa , the lower border is embellished with a frieze of winged lions i" galloping posture. It appears that this stupa has a pradakshinapatha edged by a railing around the medhi. Peculiarly this stupa has an ayaka platform and ayaka pillars. The horse in the central part of the railing is shown as emanating from a gateway with three arches which resembles the famous Sanchi gateway. But the horse is not surmounted by a Chhatra which is generally found in Barhut and other North Indian Buddhist sculptures. In both the sculptures the harmika is elongated. In slab No.l it is much more elongated and even the inverted stepped pyramid above the harmika has more steps than in slab No. 2. The head-dress of the devotees worshipping stupa in both the sculptures is in typical Amaravati style. The slabs are datable to lsl or 2nd Century A.D. as the work resembles that of the sculptures at Amaravati and Nagarjunakonda.</page><page sequence="7">Archaeology 1443 As the Buddha is not represented in anthropomorphic form at the place, Dupadu, but only symbolized by the bodhi- tree, the throne, the dharmacakra , the horse, etc., the sculpture may be assignedjto the early stage in the history of Buddhist art or to the period before the emergence of Mahayanism. The sculpture on the slabs is in low relief, but, at the same time does not show any dearth of idea or expression. It speaks eloquently of the skill and the mastery of the craftsman over his chisel and hammer, in expressing the rhythm of inner feelings. Within the restricted area of execution the artist had successfully arranged different components of the subject. Especially the plasticity employed in the smooth flowing curves of the bodies of human figures stands in comparison with the contemporary sculptured work at Amaravati and Nagarjunakonda. Buddhist art seems to have emerged at Chandavaram, some time during the first century A.D. The carved sculptural panels of Chandavaram would reveal that the stupa at the place continued to flourish till the third Century A.D. At Chandavaram and Dupadu the sculptors used the buff-coloured sand stone unlike the creamish lime stone of Palnadu, used at other Buddhist centres of the lower Krishna valley. At Chandavaram the artists have used huge, rectangular stone slabs to carve the scenes vertically, depict stories from the Buddhist mythology in different compartments one above the other.
