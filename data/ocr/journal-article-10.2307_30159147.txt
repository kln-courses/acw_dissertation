Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1965. 218 pp., 64 plates. Cloth $7.50, Paper $6.50. This book marks the full presentation of the Kahanes' long and thorough study of the Hermetic literature, a study which has led the authors to the conclusion that Hermetism was the source of the Grail myth as depicted by Wolfram von Eschenbach. There are four chapters, of which the first is an introduction in which the authors state their hypothesis. The second chapter, "The Story of a Myst," is the most important one and con- tains the Hermetic analogs upon which the hypothesis is based. Hence, this chapter will receive the greatest attention in this review. Chapter III, "The Transmission," attempts to show a plausible way in which Wolfram could have gained knowledge of the Hermetic writings, while the final chapter, "Wolfram's Hermetism," ties up loose ends and summarizes the conclu- sions. The authors do not designate their respective parts in the research nor do they specify the extent of the collaboration of Angelina Pietrangeli. They have, however, become so engrossed in their difficult studies that they have lost sight of the woods (Parzival) for the trees (Hermetic ana- logs). This defect, by no means unique in Wolfram research, could be for- given, but other more serious and more basic faults result in so flagrant a distortion, both of Wolfram's text and of its import, that a detailed refuta- tion is called for. In the first place, their basic thesis suffers from the same weakness as the Celtic hypothesis, namely, their suggested analogs "are to be found not as a unit but scattered through" (p. 5) source materials over the course of many centuries. While this fact is mentioned in the introductory chapter, it is not apparent throughout the book, and a misleading impression of unity results. Unless the Kahanes' Kyot had access to the same collected edition of the Corpus hermeticum which they have used, no such unity would have been possible. But this aside, three basic faults, especially in the important second chapter, are evident: 1. Methodology. While presenting their material in a meticulously systematic manner, the Kahanes nonethe- less violate the scientific method by failing to designate exclusively Herme- tic analogs. 2. Scope: They ignore completely analogs shared by Hermetism and both Christianity and the Arthurian tradition. 3. Substance: Their zeal to demonstrate Hermetic origins leads them into gross distortions of the</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 151 Parzival and into far-fetched derivations. I shall take up these faults, treat- ing 1 and 2 together and beginning with the last. 1. Substance: The following points illustrate distortions of the Par- zival: (a) "The Hermetic God is not anthropomorphic. . . . In Parzival, God is likewise conceived as non-anthropomorphic; this is implied in a statement such as the following: 462, 22 er hat vil durch uns getin sit sin edel h6her art durch uns ze menschen bilde wart." (pp. 8-9) The Wolfram passage does not imply a non-anthropomorphic God, but refers, by its obvious Biblical paraphrasing, to the Incarnation. Parallel statements are to be found: 119,20 "der antlitzes sich bewac / nach menschen antlitze" (Herzeloyde's description); 464,28 "got selbe antlitze hat genomen / nich der &amp;rsten megede vruht" (the "prefiguration"); and, less precisely, 817,23 "im wazzer er ze toufe gienc, / von dem Adam antlitze emphienc," or, in the same scene, 817,16 "got ist mensche und sins vater wort" (the priest to Feirefiz). (b) "The Hermetic Krater . . . descends from heaven to earth" (p. 15). "The Grail in Parzival, like the Krater of the Hermetic presentation, is brought down from heaven to earth. 'ein schar in fif der erden liez: diu vuor fif iiber die sterne h6ch.'" (p. 17) Already in 1946, Friedrich Ranke ("Zur Symbolik des Grals bei Wolfram von Eschenbach," Trivium, IV, 1, pp. 20-30) demonstrated most convincingly that the text does not imply that the Grail descended from Heaven. The "schar," to be sure, ascends after leaving the Grail be- hind them on the earth, but no word in the text states that they or anyone else ever brought the Grail from heaven. Yet the Kahanes' dogmatic asser- tion, reiterated at several other places in their book, will certainly lull the student into their doubtful interpretation. Objectivity would demand that they qualify their reading. (c) In connection with the above error, attention must be drawn to another distortion. Concerning the "schar," the Kahanes claim: "The sec- ond topos, that of the neutral angels, . . . should be separated . . . from the first topos [that of the "schar"] . . . The first group brought the Grail down to earth [again the same error!], whereas the second group came to the Grail after it was already in place" (p. 151). But in their citation to prove this statement, the Kahanes overlooked the line following the descrip- tion of the first group, namely: "ob die ir unschult wider z8ch?" 454,26, which is, of course, the parallel question, corresponding to: "ich enweiz ob got fif si verkrs / oder ob er si viirbaz verl6s / was daz sin reht, er nam si wider" 471,23. This parallel establishes an identity between the "schar" and the Neutral Angels. If there were, as the Kahanes claim, two groups, it would contradict line 454,27: "sit [i.e. after the "schar" had left the Grail] muoz sin phlegen getouftiu vruht," and "getouftiu vruht" could scarcely be a designation for the Neutral Angels.</page><page sequence="3">152 Monatshefte (d) In passing, an example (not the only one), of error in Middle High German should be pointed out. The Hermetic analogs cite "envy" as a basic vice. The Kahanes maintain: "In Parzival, two synonyms are used for the concept 'envy': nit and haz" (p. 49), and they substantiate this statement by a reference to Martin's Kommentar "for their semantic close- ness." Martin does stress the semantic closeness of nit and hat, but not with the meaning of envy, but rather with the meaning of hatred. In fact, Martin, concerning nit, stresses: "Unser Neid, wobei immer der Vorzug eines an- dern vorausgesetzt wird, liegt nur nebenbei im Begriff." (Martin ad 463,7, italics mine; Kahane, p. 49, f. 18). The Kahanes, forcing everything into the Hermetic mold, continue: "Hatred, synonymous for Wolfram with envy, is characteristic of Parzival in his dark hours" (p. 50), and cite Parzival's Gotteshat as an example of envy! It is absurd to maintain that Parzival envies God. (e) The most serious misinterpretation is the statement: "Repentance leads Parzival to moderation and to renunciation of his bodily passions... At the very end of the romance, Wolfram, looking back upon his hero, concludes that Parzival's greatest accomplishment was his turning away from the passions of the body" (p. 72-73). Have the Kahanes not read the tender scene of Parzival's reunion with Condwiramfrs? As other critics have pointed out, the reader has the feeling that Wolfram himself shares Parzival's emotion and takes refuge in the formula: "man sagete mir, si kusten sich" 801,5; but then goes on to recall Parzival's yearning at the scene of the drops of blood, and tells us: 802, 4 viir solhen kummer gap nit phant Kondwirtmtrs: diu hetez di. sin lip emphienc nie andersw&amp; minne helfe viir der minne n6t: manec wert wip im doch minne brt. ich wane, er kurzewile phlac unz an den mitten morgens tac. As further proof of Parzival's "chastity," the Kahanes cite Wolfram's final verses. I do not believe that anyone could contend that "slibes schuld[e]" in the context of a contrast between "lip" and "sale" refers to "bodily pas- sions," or that we should assume Parzival lives a chaste life with his wife upon becoming Grail King. Trevrizent's statement: "swehl grales herre aber minne gert / anders dan diu schrift in wert / der muoz es komen zarbeit" 478,13, does not imply chastity, but forbids only Minnedienst in the sense in which Amfortas practiced it. (f) Another example of gross misinterpretation of tone is the citation of Sigfne as an incorporation of concupiscence versus endurance: "The immoderacy of Sigune's desire to obtain at all costs the dog's leash ... is the exemplum of concupiscence in a human being that results from following instinct rather than intellect" (p. 98). Sigine's atonement, ac- cording to the Kahanes, then takes the form of the Hermetic opposition to concupiscence, namely, endurance ("i.e. resistance to desire," p. 95). This</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 153 is really putting the cart before the horse. Sigfine regrets her lack of, in Hermetic terms, concupiscence: "Ich hete kranke sinne / daz ich im niht minne gap" 141,20, and certainly that which plagues her least in her life of penance is desire for another lover. The whole tone of the Sigfine epi- sodes is distorted, and the concept of inordinate demands in the Minne- dienst relationship (anticipated in the Belacane-Isenhart episode, and echoed in the G~wan-Orgelise story with other implications) is com- pletely lost. (g) The deeper implications of the Parzival are frequently lost in the interpretations of this book. One example must suffice: "Man is free to accept or reject the invitation to the Hermetic community. The message of the herald is for all to hear, but each man may follow or ignore it ... The men of wrong choice are . . . an obstacle to the progress of the others .. In this obstructive effect lies the true offense against God .... In Par- zival, the Arthurian society is just such an obstructive force . . . the main representative of this society . . . is Gurnemanz." (p. 26-7) The implica- tion of this would be that Gurnemanz, Ggwin, Artfis, yes even Herzeloyde, who ultimately by her actions and her advice "tend[s] to keep the myst, Parzival, from his goal" (p. 27) are all damned, since they have, in re- jecting the "invitation" and providing an "obstruction," committed the "true offense against God." But this is a basic misunderstanding. There is cer- tainly a place in the world for such a person as Gwfiwn (whose part in the romance is dismissed with a single noncommital sentence, p. 67). Gawan's triumph in the courtly world is just as valid as Parzival's ascendency to the transcendental world of the Grail. Not every man has the opportunity to be called to the Grail. But even the Kahanes later withdraw the concept they have expressed. However, they compound their error by adducing analogs which show the "nous" (synonymous in symbolic implication with the Grail) as a prize (aOxov) to be won (p. 67). This is supposed to be re- flected in Wolfram's Parzival in those places where knights, who are not foreordained to its service, fight for the Grail. All this in face of the ex- tensive discussions among scholars of "j&amp; enmac den gral niemen bejagen" 468,12. But when Parzival becomes King of the Grail, the Kahanes emerge from their specious reasoning by claiming: ". .. the original Hermetic situation is restored: the brotherhood is again [sic] open only to the elite" (p. 68). In other words, every man has a free choice. But the prize must be won. Nonetheless, it is only for the elite and not for every man. I think Parzival would have a more difficult task to follow the thread of this reason- ing than he would to follow the track to the Grail. (h) I shall not go into detail concerning minor inexactitudes, except to remark that such arbitrary interpretations as the following tax the reader's imagination: The authors connect the phrase: "des pln&amp;ten schin," which they translate by "the planet's shining" (p. 143), with the sun, because of the "schin," thereby identifying Feirefiz with the sun, and placing him (for unexplained reasons) in the sign of Aries, in order to yield "geomantic"</page><page sequence="5">x154 Monatshefte analogs! It is well known that combinations with "schin" are among Wolf- ram's common circumlocutions. The book is also filled with dogmatic assertions, presented as fact without evidence, such as "In Parzival, Wolfram presents no elaborated description of Parzival's ecstatic state. That he experienced ecstasy is, however, implied" (p. 83). One would like to know where. Or another example: "In his rejection of Zoroastrian magic Wolfram adheres to the Hermetic attitude" (p. 149). This statement is in connection with the discussion of Clinschor, but the Kahanes' own quotation concerning Clin- schor: "daz er wol schaffet swaz er wil, / mit listen zouberlichiu zil" sub- stantiates an affirmation of the efficacy of magic; but even if it did not, even if the Kahanes had pointed out (which they do not) that Gawan defeats Clinschor's magic, it would not necessarily reflect an "Hermetic" attitude. Methodology and Scope: The book is organized in the fashion of a scientific text. Each main concept is treated in a numbered paragraph with subsidiary ideas grouped under the main headings and allotted the basic paragraph number with an individual number after a decimal point, e.g. paragraph 6: The Brotherhood, 6.1 The Community; 6.2 The Female Members, etc. In the last chapter, a summary of one Hermetic treatise is listed, marginated with the motifs which Wolfram is supposed to have adapted to his work. When dealing with the exceedingly difficult matter of "influence," a word so misused in medieval scholarship, it behooves one to adopt a metic- ulous methodology. According to the scientific method, the cause of a given effect cannot be proved unless all other factors except this cause and this cause alone remain constant. The violation of this principle is a basic and serious fault in the Kahanes' work. They attribute to Hermetic "influence" all motifs which they find in common in the Hermetic writings and in Parzival, even though this requires exceedingly far-fetched interpretations and even though other sources are much closer to Wolfram and much more appropriate to his work. For example, to attribute the basic Chris- tian concept of baptism to Hermetism rather than to Christianity is ab- surd. In addition, there is an Arthurian tradition, all of the members of which cannot be linked one to the other. What is the source, for example, of Robert de Boron's legend of the origin of the Grail and its tradition? But the Kahanes ignore the Arthurian tradition as well and treat Chris- tianity only as a source for Hermetism. To make this objection tangible, one need only examine the fourth Hermetic treatise (4 Kparip), which the authors summarize on pages 164 to 168, since "Wolfram has made the most extensive use" (p. 164) of this work. They then list a series of motifs which Wolfram is supposed to have taken from this treatise. Judging only by their most obvious and apparent applicability, one may say: at least 25 of these motifs are also Biblical; at least 6 of them are common to the Arthurian tradition; 10 are so far-fetched that they strain one's credulity (a possible exception: the Krater as Grail, which is, however, certainly not based upon the evidence of the treatise quoted, since virtually every detail</page><page sequence="6">Book Reviews 155 of the Krater, as it is described, contradicts the description of the Grail in Parzival); and 9 rest upon misinterpretations of the text such as those listed above. In addition, several of the motifs are shared by various cate- gories such as both the Bible and Arthurian tradition. I may cite another example of this same faulty methodology. On page 170, the Kahanes list some 37 ". .. key words expressing certain basic Hermetic concepts [which] have correspondences in the vocabulary of the Parzival." Using only Alexander Souter's A Pocket Lexicon to the Greek New Testament (Oxford, 1949), as a reference, I find 35 of the 37 key words are also common to the New Testament. The two which are not Biblical are Kpar0p and payIi,;L Xi0os; they are also not in the Parzival! Moreover, the New Testament certainly provides better analogs as far as affinity of concepts is concerned. For example, the chief of the deadly sins, Pride, is certainly closer to Wolfram's h6chvart than apKOVrTLI ,rpoLavla, the Hermetic analog. That Wolfram's heil and selde should both relate to yv,;aL 0eo1 is arbitrary to the point of caprice. In other words, the Kahanes have failed to show any key words pecu- liar to Hermetism, or, in their summary of motifs, a single motif which cannot be attributed to either of two sources, the Bible and/or Arthurian Tradition, both of which are much closer to Wolfram. If they had concen- trated on features of Hermetism common only to that philosophy and to Wolfram, they could have made a case, but the very fact that they did not do so is perhaps an indication that it is impossible to show such influence or motifs common only to their two points of influence. In addition to the attribution of common and obvious Christian ana- logs (such as baptism, the deadly sins, etc.) to Hermetism, the Kahanes sometimes go to absurd lengths to show Hermetic rather than Christian analogs. For example, in connection with the passage in the Parzival in which the dove brings "eine kleine wize oblit" to the Grail on Good Fri- day, the authors "suggest interpreting the wafer-bearing dove as a con- cretized representation of nous [ = the Hermetic divine intellect]" (p. 65). In order to support their interpretation, the authors must tread a tenuous path which actually leads them across the Christian concept. First, they state, the color of the dove ("durchliuhtec blanc") is derived from the characterization of nous as "life and light" (gob Ka, i 4). Then they claim "corroboration of our identification of the Hermetic nous with the dove" (p. 66) in the statement in an Hermetic writing: "What we call the Holy Ghost they [i.e., the Greeks of antiquity] call total and external nous" (p. 66). Thus they have crossed the Christian concept (Holy Ghost:dove) to get to the Hermetic nous, and by so doing they have completely ignored the Christian implications of Good Friday. To cap it all they claim: Wolf- ram's concretization of the Hermetic nous as a wafer-bearing dove sym- bolizing the Holy Ghost has a striking parallel in ecclesiastic art: the Eucha- ristic dove, a receptacle in the shape of a dove in which the consecrated Host is placed" (p. 66). In their note to the plate portraying this dove, they mention also twelfth-century examples. Why must one go so far afield? Is</page><page sequence="7">156 Monatshefte it not more simple, logical, and above all more probable (to the point of certainty) to say that Wolfram is concretizing the Christian symbolism which portrays the Holy Ghost as a dove? The Arthurian tradition is also ignored throughout. Almost as an afterthought, 19 pages from the end of the book, it must have become apparent that a great many motifs of Hermetism which had been claimed as sources for Wolfram apply also to Chr6tien de Troyes. This fact leads the authors to a 7-page discussion of his work replete with instances of Hermetic borrowing. However, the authors regretfully conclude: "These points are insufficient in themselves to substantiate fully the hypothesis of a clearly Hermetic origin for the Contes del graal" (p. 159, italics mine). Other Arthurian romances, Celtic analogs, possible Christian origins of Arthurian motifs are omitted. If one tabulates the motifs of the 52 main and subparagraphs of the book (each of which lists Hermetic analogs), one finds that at least 25 of them are also common to Le Roman de l'Estoire dou Graal by Robert de Boron, and several of these are far more clearly illustrated by Robert than by Wolfram. For example, a great many words are employed to show that Repanse de Schoye is a symbolic representation of the Hermetic yv4o0l xapf', Knowledge of Joy (the postulated etymology of her name). "Feirefiz receives her, knowledge of joy, as the prize for his conversion" (p. 86). When Parzival sees her in the Grail procession, "he is attracted to her without understanding why" (p. 87). [This assertion is not in Wolfram's text.] But Trevrizent explains: "Joy, assuming that the myst would pass his test, had prematurely lent him her cloak" (p. 87). All this is to illus- trate that: "In Hermetism the change from XMrr7 [sorrow] to xapd [joy] is the second most characteristic change in the process of rebirth" (p. 84-5). (The first change is knowledge of God). How much better an example of this Hermetic principle does Robert de Boron present, for in his romance, all those who see the Grail will be in God's presence and: "De cuer arunt emplissement / Et joie pardurablement" (lines 917 ff). Another example of the same coincidence is: "In Hermetism, a herald is appointed to proclaim the new message and to state the rules determining membership" (p. 17). The Kahanes claim that in Wolfram ". . . a division of the two functions of the herald takes place: the message is transmitted by the angel, but the rules are given through the Grail inscriptions" (ibid.). In Robert's Estoire, the angel comes to Joseph, sent as a herald by God, and tells him God's message, and states the rules pertaining to the next guardian of the Grail (lines 2887 ff.). All nine of the motifs pertaining to "The Brotherhood" (pages 24-40, one-sixth of the chapter on analogs) are equally well if not better docu- mented in the work of Robert de Boron than in that of Wolfram. All of this proves only that any story with theological overtones, involving a secret group and a central symbol, will share basic motifs with other such stories. Add to this didactic or developmental purposes and the coinci- dences will be striking. But the Kahanes never mention archetypes. Per-</page><page sequence="8">Book Reviews 157 haps Robert de Boron was also a Hermetist. The Kahanes' proposed etymology of Trevrizent (from Trismegistus "Thrice-Greatest" to Treble Escient "threefold wisdom, p. 61-63), seems far-fetched as does also their explanation of "lapsit exilis," which they de- rive from a metaphor in one of the Hermetic writings in which a l/ay7V7L X0oo0 (a magnet) is mentioned. Guiot de Provins describes the magnet as "une pierre laide et noirete," which two adjectives the Kahanes claim "ren- der approximately the same meaning as exilis." Hence, lapsit exilis desig- nates a magnet. Certainly the explanation which they proposed 8 years ago, namely, "lapis sextilis" was more convincing. (See "Wolframs Gral und Wolfram's Kyot," Ztschr. f. dt. Altertum, LXXXIX, 1 [1958], p. 200). The third, short chapter seeks to establish the means by which Wolf- ram could have come into contact with the Hermetic writings. The Kahanes repeat their theory, proposed earlier in the above mentioned article, that Kyot existed and that he is to be identified as William of Tudela. It is futile to dispute the identity. I would mention only that William himself, in the Chanson de la croisade albigeoise (of which he wrote the first part) tells us that he was not in Germany during or before the time Wolfram was writing his Parzival! William identifies himself as: Us clercs qui fo en Navarra, a Tudela noirit; Pois vint a Montalba, si cum l'estoria dit. S'i estet onze ans, al dotze s'en issit. With reference to his work, he claims: .. la chanso . . fon ben comenseia l'an de la encarnatio Del Senhor Jhesu Crist, ses mot de mentizo C'avia .M.CC. e .X. ans que venc en est mon Et si fo lan e mai can floriche'l boicho. Maestre Guilhelms la fist a Montalba on fo. (All quotations are taken from the passages cited by the Kahanes on pp. 122-3.) Now if the work was begun in 1210, and William wrote his part of it while he was in Montauban, and if, as he says, he stayed there 11 years (after he left Tudela), he could scarcely have gone to Germany before 1211 at the very earliest, or 1213, the Kahanes' suggested date, to discuss Flegethnis with Wolfram. Moreover, after he left Montauban, he went to Count Baudouin at Bruniquel, where he was made a canon. Having shown that Kyot-William was a geomancer, the Kahanes attempt to show geomatic influences in the Parzival, but again commit the same methodo- logical error that was pointed out in the discussion of the preceding chap- ter, namely, they cite geomatic analogs to details of the Parzival, but these analogs are not peculiar only to geomancy, but also to astrology. (I refer to paragraphs 4 to 8.) Hence, they show only the influence of astrology, which no one would deny. This case is no more convincing than that of the previous chapter. The final chapter, "Wolfram's Hermetism," contains the Hermetic Key Words and the summary of the fourth Hermetic treatise which were</page><page sequence="9">158 Monatshefte discussed in connection with Chapter II. Limits of space prevent refutation of a host of other details. The danger of the Kahanes' book is the dogmatic tone in which even the most dubious claims are presented. In spite of an obvious lack of orientation in Wolfram research (aside from Martin's Kommentar, only Deinert and Weber are listed in the bibliography; a few others are mentioned in foot- notes), and a failure to comprehend the philosophic import of the romance, they write with complete assurance. The book will no doubt mislead the unwary student for years to come. It is only to be regretted that so much research has been expended upon so futile a cause.
