<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ian Marshall and David Taylor A Catskills Dialogue: Looking for John Burroughs, from Wake Robin to Slabsides Not every author improves upon per- sonal acquaintance, hut an actual visit with Burroughs seems almost necesary or the right approach to his books. -Dallas Lore Sharp, The Seer of Slabsides If I were to name the three most precious re- sources of life, I should say books, friends, and na- ture ; and the greatest of these, at least the most constant and always at hand, is nature. -John Burroughs, from "The Art of Seeing Things ," quoted on a wooden sign at Slabsides Ian: David and I meet in DC at six a.m. and drive north. David's in the navigator seat, playing guitar, a three-quarter-sized guitar with decent sound that I've borrowed from my six-year-old daughter. Outside Newark, Delaware, we run into traffic on 1-95, so we cut over to New Jersey to get on the Turnpike. We stop to pee at the James Fenimore Cooper Service Area, after passing by the Joyce Kilmer. I think that I shall never pee at a urinal at the Joyce Kilmer Service Area on the New Jersey Turnpike. We're headed for the Catskills, to engage in some walking medi- tation on some of the haunts of John Burroughs. On the New York State Thruway David reads to me from Dallas Lore Sharp's The Seer of Slabsides, an early Burroughs biography. The writing is pretty hokey, the treatment of Burroughs bordering on idolatry -but there are some interesting ideas. Sharp says, for instance, that nature writers must combine the skills of naturalist, moralist, and stylist, and he claims Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment 13.1 (Winter 2006) Copyright Â© 2006 by the Association for the Study of Literature and Environment</page><page sequence="2">168 ISLE that none have blended these traits as well as Burroughs. I, of course, immediately think of Henry David Thoreau, subject of our previous ambulatory symposium, several years earlier in the Maine woods. David played the role of skeptic on that trip, claiming that Thoreau did not deserve his lofty status as top dog in the pantheon of nature writers- supreme ecohero, deity of the druid set, Pan of the pen.1 Now David proposes Burroughs as an alternate model, his writing another path through the yellow wood. Sharp writes a lot about Burroughs and Thoreau by way of compari- son. If reading is a kind of walk, he says, Thoreau hides in the bushes and jumps out at the perambulating reader yelling "Scat!" Burroughs, though, invites us to join him- and gets us home in time for tea. Well, maybe Henry isn't necessarily trying to chase us away- maybe he's found some interesting dung he wants us to take a look at, and that's why he's yelling "Scat!" And it is to his credit that he's more interested in exploring further than in observing the social niceties of tea-time. David: My two days in Washington before meeting Ian had strange- ly mimicked Burroughs' own first days there. Burroughs slept on a cot in the back of Elijah Allen's army surplus store; I slept on a cot in my brother's converted garage. Burroughs' move was sparked by leaving a dead-end teaching job in New York; I had just resigned my position as an English professor. Burroughs sought a literary community in Washington; I wanted to see the culture of monuments, museums, and libraries. At one point I knew probably only John Burroughs and I had paid homage to the statue of Spencer Fullerton Baird- natural- ist, a former secretary of the Smithsonian, first curator of the National Museum, and the first US Commissioner of Fisheries- placed quaintly in some garden named after someone. Meeting Ian at his hotel at six in the morning felt very much like a reunion. Our walks in Maine and the Smokies from years before have indelibly cast us as walking companions. To say we are walking com- panions carries a lot of weight for me; I don't really care to backpack with others, preferring my time and thoughts to be private during such times. Walking with Ian, though, never seems to add a burden to my pack, schedule, or quiet. Our walking schedules are the same- up early, stop early, sing for a long time. Our hiking pace is roughly the same, mine always slower until I am in hiking shape. Our talks, too, begin in the flurry that all good meetings bring but soon fall into a pleasant silence from fatigue and comfort. Ian offered me fruit bars and coffee from his room and within min- utes we were loaded into his purplish-blue Neon, headed north, in order to rediscover, or perhaps just understand, Burroughs. As Ian steered between trucks, trailers, and town cars, I plucked out songs, "Fraulein,"</page><page sequence="3">A Catskills Dialogue 169 "Colorado Girl," whatever else I know in the key of D. Covering my repertoire didn't take long, so our conversation turned to Thoreau and Burroughs. Ian and I have debated Thoreau's place in American nature writing for five years now. Ian points to Thoreau's craft, ingenuity, and daring as a writer. I agree that Thoreau's significance isn't in doubt, but I can't help feeling as though I'm being asked to join a cult- "One of us. One of us." Honestly, nature writing is supposed to be a loosely drawn group encompassing some highly iconoclastic wordsmiths, and yet perhaps no other American genre suffers from more idolatry and kneeling to one literary figure. I long for the day when I am at an ASLE conference and after dropping some Thoreau quote I hear a young graduate student say, "Oh yeah, I've heard of him." This is the reason I've turned to Burroughs now and then. Perhaps no other nature writer has enjoyed such literary popularity during his lifetime: speaking tours, extravagant camping trips funded by the giants of industry, a mistress who was also his publicist and literary executor, and a following which rivaled Twain's. However, the popularity which blessed Burroughs' life cursed his literary legacy. After the initial glut of gushing biography and pseudo-criticism in the ten years following his death, Burroughs' work was ignored for fifty years. "Ignored" is too kind a word. Think black hole. I had brought along a copy of Sharp's The Seer of Slabsides, which I had found years ago in a used bookstore. His eulogy to Burroughs is laced with the kind of rhetoric which in part doomed Burroughs' recognition: He was the simplest man I ever knew, simpler than a child; for children are often self-conscious and uninterested, whereas Burroughs' interest and curiosity grew with the years, and his directness, his spontaneity, his instant pleasure and his constant joy in living, his utter naturalness and naivete amounted to genius. (6-7) I read portions of it to Ian as a humorous means to pass the miles; Ian, however, wants to dwell on Sharp's contrast of Thoreau and Bur- roughs: Thoreau is a succession of showers- 'tempests'; his pages are sheet- lightning, electrifying, purifying, illuminating, but not altogether conducive to peace [...]. There is a clear sky in Burroughs' pages, a rural landscape, wide, gently rolling, with cattle standing here and there beneath the trees. (50) Ian jumps on such descriptions with passion, exclaiming, "He's right. And ... and ... we should want tempests." I like tempests as</page><page sequence="4">170 ISLE much as the next eco-lit type, but I wonder out loud if we haven't been co-opted by a false need for jolt after jolt: "Hasn't it become something like the MTV of nature writing- that there have to be bells and whistles every page or so? I mean, what's the percentage of books about grizzlies and wolves vs., oh, say, muskrats or sparrows?" We stop to pee at the James Fenimore Cooper Service area and eat greasy chicken at the Kenny Rogers. I try to remember if Natty ever pees in the Leatherstocking tales. This thought holds me for some time. Crackle crunch of skin off the thigh. Ian: We set up at the North Lake campground and are out walking by early afternoon. We visit the site of the Catskill Mountain House, then traipse along a cool trail under the escarpment, bushwhacking up after our trail peters out, then up to South Peak and the site of the Kaaterskill Hotel, then back along the top of the escarpment. All along, there are lovely views of the Hudson to the east, neat overhanging slabs on the edge of the scarp, hemlocks and balsam fir. Back at the Mountain House site, we recall Cooper's Natty Bumppo saying in The Pioneers that from here you could see "all creation." This is also the site, of course, of Irving's "Rip Van Winkle" and of a slew of Hudson River School paintings. Cole was here many times, beginning in 1824- his Lake with Dead Trees was South Lake. I'm busy taking pictures, hoping to capture painterly scenes, trying to notice how things have changed in the past century and a half, or how they've stayed the same. I get a shot of a dead tree- with initials carved in it. There are also initials carved in the sandstone at the Mountain House site- some dating back to the 1840s and '50s, but those are beautifully and deeply carved. Visiting locales from the Hudson River School, we talk about art and nationalism. When Americans were desperate to establish their cultural independence in the first half of the nineteenth century, eager to create distinctly American art and literature, they started by celebrat- ing the American landscape- specifically this American landscape, the Catskills. Late in the afternoon we sit out a thunderstorm in the tent. Burroughs comes up briefly- David reads Burroughs' own response to Thoreau. Burroughs spoke of his indebtedness to Thoreau, and his sense that Thoreau is more heroic and spiritual than himself. That seems true enough. David's defense of Burroughs rests on the equally true observation that Burroughs is more social than Thoreau, and less hung up on the idea of wilderness excursion as the solo vision-quest thing, where we are solitary venturers in search of enlightenment. While David rests, I take a turn with the guitar, playing tunes by Greg Brown and Lucinda Williams: "The sun came up, it was another day; / the sun went down, and you were blown away." After the storm, the day is cooled off nicely, and we both sit on rocks by the water and</page><page sequence="5">A Catskills Dialogue 171 write. Then David makes a small fire with wet wood while I boil water for tea. Then I pore over maps, as I've been doing much of the day, try- ing to figure out where we can get to in the few days we have available. David asks what is it with me and maps. I think we're genetically pro- grammed, I say, to interpret things symbolically- that reading language or reading maps exercises skills that helped our species survive, skills in reading the land or reading tracks. And it's like anything else that helps us pass on our genes- if it feels good, we do it, and we get good at it. Reading, it seems to me, engages the highest human faculties, from our sharp vision to our meaning-making minds. Maybe in the next few days I'll figure out why we don't read much of John Burroughs anymore. David: Our campsite is not far from the Mountain House site. There's a lilac off to the right on the way up. Two signs up on top tell all about the visitors to the site and the history of the resort- but there's nothing about the natural history. Up at the site are a daughter and a Dad. She has spiked hair, dyed red on the ends, and a black tank top. Her dad's a fine example of a Bronx lifer awkwardly pasted in the scenery of the Catskills. They ask me to take their photo. I do so hap- pily because it reminds me of my daughter Kory. The father, looking around the site of the Old Mountain House, and the Hudson River Valley laid out below the escarpment, says, "Why'd they ever tear it down? What a shame. This place must have been something back then." Ian and I saunter down a trail along a ridge. Ian imitates the father's accent, saying, "Yeah, we gotta get dis nature shit outta da way; then this place could really be somethin again." I am known for my inability to follow trails, and the one we are taking has no markers. It winds along the rocky cliff escarpment- lots of water, wild azaleas, striped maple, and balsam fir. Ian tells me that John Bartram traveled here to see the balsam fir. Soon we are lost again and bushwhack up through a laurel thicket. I see some deer droppings and lots of hemlock. Finally we reach the marked trail and follow it to the top of South Mountain, where white birches are every where- some horticulturally aligned. We travel in a circle off South, and I tell Ian about my divorce, about my ex's upcoming remarriage, about all my fears and frustrations. Back at the Mountain House site, it is a gorgeous view into the Hudson River Valley. It reminds me of the view off the Saluda Grade of the Blue Ridge into the Piedmont of South Carolina. Except here one can see the Appalachians on the eastern horizon. What must this have meant to Americans looking for a national definition? Is the view free? Sublime?</page><page sequence="6">172 ISLE We get lost again on the way down by taking a trail off to the east. Back at camp, I wander down to the lake to write, to think of my daugh- ter. How do I let go without abandoning? Patience, attention, and accep- tance. The sound of waves. Perhaps emotions do have natural analogies, and we look for lessons to which we know answers. I am enamored of Ian's love for maps. I am enamored of his plan-making, and revisions to his plans, his asking me for acceptance, then revising again and asking all over again. Maybe these tourist landscapes need maps too. In the most suburban of trails are slick rocks and wild azaleas. Maybe domesticity needs maps. In the most suburban of lives is endangered wildness. Maybe no land or life is ever fully traveled really. Beside me on the rock on which I am sitting I can count the graffiti etchings: M.E. '73; D. J. '73; Holly '87; Margaret '87; Virginia '87. When I stand I see that I have been sitting on H. S. '87. It's a well-worn rock, ripped and torn from its resting place millennia ago. I wish for Ian always maps. I wish for Kory always love. I wish for myself patience. It has been a wild day. Ian: In the morning we hike along the cascades of Lake Creek to Kaaterskill Falls. It is a dynamic place, the falls, higher than Niagara, though thinner, gleaming in sunlight and crashing down, the mist swirling up and a roar like approaching traffic that never passes and recedes. A steep and unmaintained trail leads above the lower falls, then hugs the cliff and horseshoes behind the upper falls. The trail's cliff-hug is high enough that I don't want to try it by myself, so I turn back to get David. Behind the falls we talk about the Hudson River School painters who visited here- Cole did five paintings of the falls, including one from our vantage point behind them. The energy of the scene is stun- ning-morning light almost tangible, the unceasing water splaying out over the cliff and crashing into the pool below, at times making distinct splats, and the mist keeps billowing up, and arcing above it all, shimmering over the pool above the lower falls, there's a rainbow. Taking it all in, David turns to me and says, "This must have been something back then." Unbelievably, considering the cultural significance of this spot and its incredible beauty and power, there's nobody else here on this day before Memorial Day Weekend. David: When Ian first makes his way to the upper falls, I think of reenacting Burroughs by staying at the lower falls, settling for the unspectacular. I feel indolent.</page><page sequence="7">A Catskills Dialogue 173 Ian comes down and tells me I must come up. The Upper Falls is pictured in many nineteenth-century drawings and paintings as a place for tourists as they walked behind the Falls. We talk about sublimity and beauty. Walking behind the Falls is wonderful. I walk down and stand near where the Falls hits. The noise is overwhelming. Above the Falls we find the site of the sawmill where Channing and Thoreau stayed in 1844. At the top, I sit on a rock close to the edge and rest while Ian walks around. In the afternoon, Ian goes for a walk up to North Point. I sleep and get deeper into the darkness. When Ian returns we go back up the Mountain House Lookout. I ask him about the clouds and how Thoreau would describe them, and we talk about our divorces. In the evening we play guitar and sing songs. The couple at the next site applauds only for "All Along the Watchtower." Next day we are out looking for Burroughs' Woodchuck Lodge. While driving we discuss Thoreau's popularity. I object to Thoreau's emphasis on solitude, and the prevalence of the spiritual quest pattern of nature writing, and the fact that those patterns are so religiously adhered to by nature writers. What I like about Burroughs is that he does not feel obliged to turn every excursion into the backyard into some sort of quest for the Holy Meaning of Life Grail. Plus, he writes of companionship. He appeals to our attempts to work out a way to achieve a sense of human connection, a feeling of community, in a way that Thoreau does not. We find Hardscrabble Road but can't find the turn to John Bur- roughs Memorial Road. The sign is turned so we can't tell which way to Woodchuck Lodge. There are no markers. We try both ways, and finally find Woodchuck Lodge on the road to the left. It is in disrepair- the garage has fallen in, and windows are boarded up. The porch fencing, though, is intact, a sort of Chippendale of branches. In a register book at the front of the house, everyone- meaning about five or six people in the last week- expresses astonishment at the horrible condition of the cabin. I walk around the numbered trail out back. A lilac bush grows on the right side of the porch- a tribute to Whitman, maybe? After all, Burroughs wrote the first biography of Whitman. Further down the road we stop at Memorial Field, where a three- sided kiosk informs the viewer of Burroughs' life and work and a sign points the way to Burroughs' gravesite. There a square of slate marks the boundaries of the grave. Nearby there is a bronze plaque on the large rock behind the grave, "Boyhood Rock," evidently a favorite of Burroughs' youth. Atop the rock I imitate the posture of Burroughs on the plaque while Ian takes a picture. We read the register in a copper</page><page sequence="8">174 ISLE box with visitors' dedications to Burroughs. At Waiden people bring sticks and stones; here, people write to Burroughs, thanking him for his good words. We too honor him in the register, then return to Wood- chuck Lodge and write in our journals. Ian: A couple of quotes from the register at Burroughs' gravesite, a wonderfully simple place, the first from Henry Beston: "It is only when we are aware of the earth, and of the earth as poetry, that we truly live." The second is a Burroughs quote: "The place to observe nature is where you are; the walk to take today is the walk you took yester- day." These epigrams were jotted down by visitors to Burroughs' grave (and the sources, we learn later, are Beston's Herbs and the Earth , 4, and Burroughs's "A Sharp Lookout," 6). My own contribution is a haiku: Weeds and flowers on the nature lover's grave not yet in bloom On the ride here we talked more about the comparative merits of Burroughs and Thoreau as nature writer. David objects to Thoreau's use of transcendentalist schtick, always on the lookout for the moral meaning of things, and the fact that nature writers keep imitating Tho- reau. We also talk more about Dallas Lore Sharp's interesting three-part schematic of the essentials of the nature-writer- that the nature-writer must be naturalist, moralist, and stylist. In each of these areas the na- ture writer has room for originality and distinctiveness- a new area to explore as naturalist, or another angle or set of knowledge; a different philosophy or set of moral values; and of course one's own style. I give Burroughs credit for being a fine naturalist, and if you add up what's in all his essays, a coherent philosophy or set of values emerges- anti- nature-fakery, attention to the small and near-at-hand as opposed to the grandiose. But ultimately I find the meditative/spiritual/philosophi- cal/moralistic dimension of Burroughs unfulfilling. For one thing, he believed in social Darwinism. And he's just not as deep as Thoreau. In "A Bed of Boughs," set around Peekamoose Mountain, Burroughs speaks of losing a big fish that he had on his line and in his fingers. It's a nice little episode, but Thoreau would have made that fish mean something- or even if he hadn't he sets us up for that line of thinking by convincing us that if we ponder things or meditate on them, we will find more to them- another dimension, more depth. He might have added that fish to his famous list of things lost- hound, bay horse, turtle dove, and brook trout. At the same time I'm aware that the transcendentalist method of finding meaning is another way of valuing nature insofar as it is useful- useful spiritually if not economically. Can't we just value the</page><page sequence="9">A Catskills Dialogue 175 lost fish as a lost fish? Does it always have to mean something? Bur- roughs himself noted, "I paint the bird for its own sake, and for the pleasure it affords me, and am annoyed by any lesson or moral twist" (Heart 74-75). By contrast, he said, Thoreau looks "intently for a bird behind the bird,- for a mythology to shine through his ornithology" ("Henry" 40). But I guess I'd like Burroughs to at least consider possibilities of meaning. So, he's not deep or philosophical. Last night we were roaring about Burroughs' fascination with fresh milk and young girls. I was reading "A Bed of Boughs" and David "A Summer Adventure," about Burroughs' raft trip on the Delaware. In both, Burroughs goes on and on about getting good fresh milk from local farmhouses- and about admiring the daughters at those farmhouses- young girls, as young as twelve or thirteen. In one hilarious section in "Boughs" he talks about how being in the woods for a week heightens the operations of our senses- and that's why he needs to tell about the lovely young girls at a farmhouse. So one more strike against Burroughs- he was a dirty old man. Of course David brought up by way of comparison Thoreau's homo- erotic poem "The Gentle Boy." I point out that Thoreau admired only from afar, and probably only in his subconscious. Burroughs apparently did have a real and rich extracurricular love life, though, with his agent and literary executor Clara Barrus. David tells me that Burroughs' wife Ursula was obsessed with cleaning and that Burroughs kept a bed out here on the porch of Woodchuck Lodge- probably to get away from Ursula as well as to be closer to nature. On the third item of Sharp's catalogue- the nature writer as stylist. Maybe Thoreau is too often emulated. But he's a great stylist. And Bur- roughs? Sure he's interesting. And I will grant that his prose succeeds in achieving what he considered the "basic qualities of good litera- ture-directness, veracity, vitality, and beauty and reality of natural things" (qtd. in Bergon 36). But notice his own reference to "good"- not great- literature. He also indulged in the pathetic fallacy at times, de- spite his own condemnation of the kind of excessive anthropomorphism that amounted to nature fakery. Despite his claim to paint the bird for its own sake, he at times wrote of birds, as Frank Bergon notes in the Introduction to A Sharp Lookout , as "widowed mothers" and "happy bridegrooms," and he praised their songs as music (36, 51). His literary achievement is also limited by the fact that he wrote only essays, and not one book-length work of nature writing. Perhaps that practice was financially driven- that way he could sell the pieces first to magazines, then reprint in his books, and get paid twice for the same work. Now it's time for us to go backpacking.</page><page sequence="10">176 ISLE David: We set off into the Burroughs Range- Slide, Wittenberg, and Cornell Mountains. The trail is well marked but very steep, and we can easily see the transitions between Lauentian zones. Not many others on the trail. At the top of Slide, there is another memorial to Burroughs, a plaque with the quote "The works of Man dwindle [. . .]." The line comes from a passage in "The Heart of the Southern Catskills" extolling the wildness of Slide: All was mountain and forest on every hand. Civilization seemed to have done little more than to have scratched the rough, shaggy surface of the earth here and there. In any such view, the wild, the aboriginal, the geographical greatly predominate. The works of man dwindle, and the original features of the huge globe come out. Every single object or point is dwarfed; the valley of the Hudson is only a wrinkle in the earth's surface. You discover with a feeling of surprise that the great thing is the earth itself, which stretches away on every hand so far beyond your ken. (48-49) Ian and I hang out here and talk about this view of "the rough, shaggy surface of the earth" vs. that of Katahdin. The trail down is extremely steep, with lots of spots where we need to drop our packs and walking sticks down rock faces so we can use our hands to scramble down. We camp in a thicket of white and black birch, maple and horn- beam, and we start a fire well before dark to keep away black flies. Ian carefully hangs our food and stashes gear inside the tent because of the porcupines. I lie down at 8:30 and am overwhelmed with missing my daughter. After our divorce, my ex-wife returned to her home in Texas, with Kory, and now I have left my job in South Carolina so that I can move to Texas to be closer to Kory. In the night we hear porcupines and yell at them and listen to them waddle off. Ian: Up on Slide we read "The Art of Seeing Things" and "In the Circuit of the Summer Hills." "Seeing Things" is about love- love of books, love of friends, love of nature, which is always available to us. For all my critiquing of Burroughs for his celebration of milkmaids, and for his pedestrian style, clearly he shows us how to love a place and how to love nature- and he practices it. Yes: "The great thing is the earth itself." "Summer Hills" is about Burroughs' rambles around Woodchuck Lodge, including his discussion of common critters- woodchuck, crow, jay, squirrel. I mention to David my growing admiration for Burroughs' lessons on love, and he says, "My work here is done." He asks what it says about our capacity to love if people like Thoreau and Burroughs committed themselves so thoroughly and intensely to one place- Tho-</page><page sequence="11">A Catskills Dialogue 177 reau's Waiden and the environs of Concord, Burroughs' Catskills- and we're out hiking in some place we had to travel to get to. What it says, perhaps, has something to do with the fact that we're two divorced guys. Maybe we just haven't found the right place. Meanwhile, we are fortunate to have gotten to know places like Ktaadn, the Rockies, the Adirondacks, the Smokies. By the fire that night, I recall reading Burroughs' appreciation for the wonderfully varied and shifting shapes cast by firelight. I also appreciate the satisfaction of tending a fire and of seeing your work of gathering and breaking the wood pay off in such readily apparent energy. Of course design is involved, too, but you need good materi- als. Tonight we've got birch and balsam fir, and our efforts are amply rewarded. David: At breakfast the next morning Ian asks if he is allowed to make jokes about the fact that tomorrow Johanna is getting married. Or remarried. I consent fully, and he sings to the tune of "The Wed- ding Song": Ian: David, he's out in the woods Pretending he's John Burroughs. He's hiking with some other dude Who thinks he's Henry Thoreau- There are blisters And there are bugs. David: On the trail we pass other campsites and ascend Cornell. A small side trail leads to the top, which is covered in spruce, hemlock, and balsam. While sitting there I ask Ian if the reason that academics and nature types now seem to ignore Burroughs is that he wrote to a middle class audience, whereas Thoreau wrote to the disenfranchised or dissatisfied. There's a stiff climb to the top of Wittenberg, then a big flat open summit. I sit on the edge, longing for Kory. We meet an editor for the New York Times who hikes up here often. We mention Burroughs, about whom he has little knowledge. There's a long descent off Wittenberg, and Ian and I begin to run across lots of people and dogs, some kids and old folk, some nice people, some not. Ian has a minor fall and ankle twist. We stop for a break at Woodland campground. A hiking couple comes by and the woman teases us about looking tired. But when we start up the steep trail we soon pass the couple coming back- they have turned around -and Ian gives the woman some friendly shit about being tired already. Ha.</page><page sequence="12">178 ISLE We camp by a creek in a pretty hemlock and black birch thicket and play music late into the evening. A deer comes by and has little to no fear of us, or our music. It has been a good day of hiking. Ian says it is good to push ourselves, that it restores our wildness, our physicality. Ian: We saw a trillium, an early bloomer, this morning on Cornell. David tells me trillium is also called "wake-robin"- hence the title of Burroughs' first nature book. Very rigorous steep trails here in the Catskills, with lots of sections requiring scrambling and stretching for toe holds. Great view up on Wit- tenberg-mountains upon mountains arrayed, views of Peekamoose, the Ashokan reservoir, northern Catskills. Been hearing white-throated sparrows this morning- my favorite bird call. If I am coming to appreciate Burroughs more, I also think that Da- vid, for all his protestations, still finds much to admire in Thoreau's principles. When I brought up my wonderment at his leaving a tenured position to be nearer to Kory, David said, "Haven't you ever actually read Thoreau?" Point taken. David's big discovery of the morning: Keebler doesn't put enough peanut butter in their peanut-butter-and-cheese crackers. My Wittenberg haiku: At the edge of a cliff a man looks at mountains taking notes We both had a tough time in the afternoon. These mountains are hard going. Much less discussion after Wittenberg. We're both too tired. David's struggling with personal demons as well as blisters, and I twisted my ankle coming down Wittenberg. Now, around the fire, David's playing one of his fine songs, "What Shall We Say." David: We're up early and eat little before we hit the trail. I make an altar of cones, birch leaves, needles, and twigs for Johanna and Joe, offer a prayer for their happiness. Ian keeps singing the melody to "The Wedding Song" and I can't help but laugh. We hike out in the morning, eat an overpriced breakfast in Wood- stock, then commence a long search for another of Burroughs' homes, Slabsides. We drive up and down Rt. 16 until we get some vague direc- tions from a woman working in her herb garden. There are no signs or directions to guide us there. But it's a beautiful place, loose and fun with wood. A paper taped to a window says that Slabsides was the "most visited literary shrine in America" during Burroughs' lifetime. Visitors included the likes of John Muir, Walt Whitman, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Thomas Edison, and Teddy Roosevelt.</page><page sequence="13">A Catskills Dialogue 179 Lots of sassafras, chestnut oak, and hemlock, with blackberries blooming. Ian: Slabsides is way cool. The outer logs still have the bark on them (which is where the name comes from- like the outer crust of a loaf of bread, said Burroughs), and odd-shaped pieces of wood are neatly fitted into the woodwork of the porch. Forked branches hold up cross-breams, and other forked pieces form some of the understory latticework under the railings. It's much larger than Thoreau's cabin at Waiden, and more rustic and woodsy and wild. I think of David's sense that Burroughs gets a bad rap, like in Bill McKibben's introduction to Birch Browsings , as the "bard of the birdfeeder" (xi). Burroughs may write about "Wild Life about My Cabin," but this cabin is way out there- so deep in the woods and off the beaten path that you need a compass to find it- there are no signs, and no sign of tourists' presence. It could be that Bur- roughs lived, if not wrote, wilder than Thoreau. Certainly his hikes in the Catskills, as we found out through first-hand (and twisted ankle) experience, are no stroll down a suburban sidewalk. And we were on marked trails where Burroughs was bushwhacking. Thoreau just put more emphasis on the wild wherever he found it. Burroughs may have been quieter and less jolting, but to see him as only a celebrant of the middle ground is to understate his adventurousness. Maybe that spirit doesn't get across in Burroughs' writing because he's less of a writer than Thoreau. But he's still a good one, central to the nature writing tradition. In his concern for backyard nature, he anticipates recent interest in urban nature. And yet he knows moun- tains, too- bushwhacking across the steep Catskills to find a lake to fish. There's an interesting paradox here: Burroughs' Catskills were (and are) wilder than Thoreau's Concord, but Burroughs is more pas- toral as a writer, Thoreau more the celebrator of the wild wherever we may find it. A sign near Slabsides offers the quote about books, friends, and nature, the one that serves as our epigraph ("Art" 118). It's terrific, though at the moment I'm not inclined to buy into the hierarchy Bur- roughs suggests, that nature necessarily comes first. Maybe this is like Sharp's tripartite outline of the requirements for nature writing. In truth, we need all three. David is right, Burroughs does offer a model for an experience of nature that can accommodate friendship, that does not require solitude a la Thoreau. It's been great to be out here in Burroughs country reading his words in place, and it's been great to have been here with David as my literary guide to Burroughs. And as my friend. On the drive home we share our culminating thoughts on Bur- roughs. What we've been discovering is greater complexity in Bur-</page><page sequence="14">180 ISLE roughs than he's usually given credit for. First, there's greater complex- ity in the land he knew and loved. David says his perception of the Catskills before we got there was that they were touristy bumps full of quaint Rip Van Winkle "Sleep Inns" and Jewish comedians. What we found is a very rugged and wild landscape, with steep ascents and a grand panorama at Wittenberg. Even Kaaterskill Falls, amazingly, is not full of lookout towers and souvenir shops. It's wilder than either of us had imagined. David: We also find that there is greater complexity in the man. Bur- roughs may have been capable of boorish sexism in his preoccupation with milkmaids, and he may have been reactionary in his social Dar- winism. But at the same time Burroughs could be friend and advocate for a passionate liberal like Walt Whitman. Burroughs was also friends with John Muir and Teddy Roosevelt, and was perhaps even more in- fluential than Muir in terms of affecting- or initiating- environmental policy through Roosevelt. Friends too with captains of industry like Firestone and Ford, Burroughs could also complain that "We live in an age of iron and have all we can do to keep the iron from entering our souls" ("Strenuous" 111). Trapped in a difficult and perhaps unloving marriage, he found romantic happiness with Clara Barrus. And for all his "bard of the birdfeeder" side, we can appreciate his wildness once we retraced some of his steps. Ian: We find, too, greater complexity in his writing. For all the stuff about robins and chickadees in "Wild Life about my Cabin," he ends the essay with exultant prose on the eagle and a conservationist plea that stresses the connection between man and eagle- both, he says, are motivated by the same impulses in seeking savage beauty. At the end Burroughs says he wants his emotions to soar with the eagle- this from the guy who decried nature fakery and who seems at times blind to the implications of his emphasis on backyard nature- that if it's there in the backyard, we don't need to save it in Yosemite, or in Adirondack Park, or in the Catskills, or in the Maine Woods. And yet here he is in "Wild Life about My Cabin" celebrating an image of wildness. At times Burroughs could be corny and hokey as a writer, but at times his prose can soar. At times he remains content with surface de- scriptions, but at times he can be downright Thoreauvian in exploring the metaphoric implications of natural facts. See, for example, "A Still Small Voice," where Burroughs compares the slow but profound work of glaciers to the slow and profound operations of art and literature. David: Finally, we see complexity in the public reception of Bur- roughs. His early popularity served to domesticate Burroughs in the literary imagination. But now Slabsides, once the famous literary shrine, is darned obscure, as our three trips up and down Rt. 16 attest. We</page><page sequence="15">A Catskills Dialogue 181 also took a wrong turn in looking for Woodchuck Lodge, which has fallen into disrepair. Clearly, Burroughs has lapsed into some degree of obscurity. Judging from his absence from nature writing anthologies and the lack of ecocritical attention directed at his work, he is as remote and inaccessible as Slabsides. In a way, maybe his early popularity cre- ated that effect. He wasn't an unknown to be discovered, like Thoreau and Muir were. But he's becoming that- and so for us on this trip our search for Burroughs did end up as an exploration into unknown ter- ritory-into a kind of wild. NOTES 1.
