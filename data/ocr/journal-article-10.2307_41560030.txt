<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Malay Kěris: its origin and development By G. C. WOOLLEY The definition of what a këris is should refer primarily to the hlade only: the hilt and sheath are no doubt essential parts of a -complete "weapon, but these vary in different parts of the Malayan Archipelago, and a Malay examining a weapon will look first to the blade : its setting is to him, in comparison, immaterial, and if it dòes not suit his taste he would not hesitate about changing it. Gardner's definition* is "It is primarily a dagger with a handle set at an angle to the blade, a sort of pistol grip, in fact, to enable the wielder to thrust", but this seems to be far too vague, and under it he admits, as varieties of the keris , the badek and tumbóle lada, which, though they can be used for stabbing, are single-edged knives. I would suggest "The Keris is a weapon of dagger or rap.er form, long or short, straight or wavy, double-edged, tapering to a point, •except in some cases of the Kěris Sulok, primarily for thrusting, and its essential characteristic is the widening of the blade towards the hilt to form a guard long and pointed on one side, short and rounded on the other See Pl. XV. This widening always begins •on the blade itself, but is often completed by a separate piece of metal (the ganja) which may be loose or fastened to the blade. I say primarily for thrusting so as to cover the later development of the Keris Suluk or sundang where the blade becomes heavier and is fitted with a different type of hilt, to give a grip for a cutting blow. The blade, in section, in the middle, may be practically fiat, or slightly elliptical, or diamond shaped (particularly in the Keris Panjang type) or with a rib down the middle of the blade some- times very pronounced, with or without a slight thickening close to the edge, making a shallow groove on each side.

Crawfurd, in his 'Descriptive Dictionary of the Indian Islands'" says that the word "Kris" is an abbreviation of 'Karts' a dagger or poniard, and that "it is probably a Malay word, now general in the Archipelago" : from this Mr. Williams infers that 'it was apparently not thought necessary to invent for the weapon a new name, as would most certainly have been done had it come into- existence as a separate weapon by introduction from outside or independent invention'. No form ' Kâris ' however is given in Crawfurd's own dictionary, neither have I found it in Wilkinson or any other : why then should it not be regarded as 'a new name' for a new weapon ? The Spaniards in the Philippines referred to it as 'Calis'; it was known there, but was obviously introduced and used by immigrant Malays, Sulus, Bugis or Illanunsr not by the aboriginal tribes. An anonymous 'Historical Descrip- tion of the Kingdom of Macassar in the East Indies', London, 1701, states that "the Crit is a weapon peculiar to the Malays, the Macas- sarians, the Javanese and other neighbouring islands". Again, De la Lóubere in his "New Historical relation of the Kingdom of Siam", London 1693, in a list of Siamese arms, includes "Krid, a dagger which the King gives to the Mandarins: they wear it Fig. 2.

Woolley thrust into a girdle on the left side, but very much before. The Europeans do corruptly call it 'Krisť 99 : this suits a special imported weapon, worn as a token of rank by certain dignitaries, not a common national weapon in Siam. Moreover, if the këris was introduced from abroad, from what country did it come ? It is inconceivable that all trace of it should have vanished from its country of origin: the sword was known from remote times in India, Arabia, Europe and China, all with possible connections with the Malay Archipelago by ancient or mediaeval trade routes: swords there were long or short; there were wavy blades as well as straight; but in no placç is there the characteristic Malay cganja9: the blades have no unequal widening towards the hilt though they, may be set in a cross-hilted handle, or they may widen equally on each side, as in the type of iron- or bronze-age sword common all over Europe. Before going further, it is advisable, as there are sö many types of blades to get a preliminary rough classification of then and to see if there is any indication as to which type is the earliest. Such a classification may be : - (i) straight blades, of short or medium length (ii) wavy blades, of short or medium length (iii) the këris panjang, straight or wavy, to include both këris bahari and hěris pekakak. (iv) the cutting kěris, Këris Sulok or Sundang, (See PI: I). No. (iv) is obviously a later type, developed in one district only. No. (iii) is also a later type, originating in Sumatra or the Northern part of the Peninsula. No. (ii) may be a very early form, but it is more likely to be a variation of a still earlier type as it requires additional process in manufacture: in appearance it might be thought- more handsome and attractive, but for actual use old and renowned warriors are reported to have preferred the straight blade, of short length, owing to the scarcity and value of iron. Crawfurd, indeed, History of Indian Archipelago I p. 224, empha- sises this: the këris, he says, 'is a weapon fitter for assasination than war/ it was 'not invented for that purpose or because of a love of close combat (which is contrary to their ideas) but because of the scarcity and dearness of iron : otherwise why neglect the useful1 and formidable sword for the trifling ineffectual dagger?' and 'its use was continued later (i.e. when iron was more obtain- able) because of conservatism and pride.' If the këris t hen was not introduced from abroad but originated in the Archipelago, there are two possible lines of investigation Journal Malayan Branch [Vol. XX, Part II,</page><page sequence="4">The Malay Kěris: its origin and development 63 which it may be worth while to examine, even if 110 certainty is likely to result: these are (i) was it adapted, when iron became available, from some former type of weapon (ii) was it an original invention. Sir Kichard Winstedt savs that most of the evidence points to a Javanese origin, but that "it is idle to speculate" further as to whether the këris blade is a dragon form made by dragon worshippers or modelled from the horns of butting animals or whether its continued use was due to superstitious respect or from its fitness for warfare in close jungle. Mr. Williams suggests that the К Ms is derived from the spear which was known in the Archipelago in much earlier times - and it is in support of this theory that he quotes Crawfurd to show that ' Kěris ' is not 'a new name' for a new weapon, but a mere derivative from 'karis'. Incidentally, this argument does not seem to fit in well with the latter part of Mr. Williams' paper in which he deals with the respect paid to këris and its alleged magical or super- natural qualities which would have justified, or required, a special new name. Mr. Williams states that the këris "would not have developed out of the more modern patterns of Malay spear, seen in Museums today, but out of some earlier type, in use many centu- ries ago which haa long become obselete and, as such things do in damp tropical countries, disappeared altogether leaving 110 trace behind." He supposes then that as the long shaft of a spear might be inconvenient in jungle fighting or impede the owner's flight throúgh jungle, he cut off the shaft, so as to retain the valuable blade, and found that it made quite a serviceable dagger : he then constructed a separate hilt for it, which was loosely attached, and filed down one side of the 'guard', thus making the short blunt 'dagu' 011 one side of the gem ja, so that the long point should not scratch him if he wore his new dagger in his belt, and so got a blade which was easily convertible for use as a spearhead. In course of time clever smiths turned the deformed blunt end of the dagu into "one of the most artistic parts of a well-made weapon" which would be comfortable when worn with the short side next to the body. It is an unconvincing argument. It postulates some primi- tive type of spear which is now altogether unknown, and the 'double purpose' blade is most improbable: if a man went out to fight with the blade ready 011 his spear shaft for the opening phase of an encounter, did he carry a loose hilt and sheath with him? A spear blade must be firmly fixed, and must be retractable : the valuable blade would be lost and its owner left defenceless if it dropped off in the course of the fight or was left sticking in a wicker or wooden shield : if the owner turned to flee, would he have time to remove the blade and fix it into his dagger hilt? The blade, when carried in his belt, would have its side agaiiist his body, not the point of 19^7] Boyal Asiatic Socieiy.</page><page sequence="5">&lt;64 G. С. Wool ley the ganja, and by the time that the artistic daga had been evolved there were customary rules for the wearing of këris which prescribed when it must be worn with the tip of the hilt towards or away from the body, i.e. when the daga would be on the top or on the lower side: if it was 'comfortable' in one position only, the sharp aring on the other side would have to be filed down also. The whole sug- gestion of filing down seems unnecessary, as the man would not carry a naked blade in his belt, and a sheath would protect him from any scratch. The theory also assumes that the original spear blade had projecting points at the base, which seems most unlikely, as they might act as barbs and prevent the spear being withdrawn rapidly for further use. Mr. Williams makes the 'tentative suggestion' that the këris Avas introduced in the 14th or early 15th century, in Java, when the Majapahit power was in the ascendent: but by that time the primitive form of spear from which he thinks the këris Avas derived must already have vanished* and the earliest known form, the këris Majapahit with blade and hilt in one piece, the latter in the form of a god, would never have been convertible into a spear, unless indeed it was to be lashed on to the end of a wooden shaft : and a spear with such a weak blade would be a most unreliable weapon. Mr. Gardner suggests that the l'ëris has been evolved from the sting of the ikan pari , sting ray : these fish are common in Malayan waters, and the dangerous or deadly wounds that the stings could inflict would be well-known to the Malay fishermen. A specimen of a sting with the1 base shaved down as if it had once been fitted into a handle has been found on a prehistoric site, and other speci- mens have been found far inland, probably having been taken there for purposes of trade, as daggers. Even in modern times they have been used as weapons. He found that if the base of the sting was wrapped in cloth it could be held between finger and thumb for an •effective thrust, and he even has one actually fitted into a këris hilt. One may admit all this, but it does not follow that because an ilcan pari sting may be used as an efficient thrusting weapon that it was the original from which the këris was derived: if the sting was wrapped in cloth at the base it would provide an equally good grip if held in the fist point up or down, as an ordinary dagger: an up-country Sakai or Jakun might value it as being unusual, but for mere efficiency a sharpened slip of bamboo would be just as good and would cost him nothing - his jungles were full of it : the .sting would make a bad wound and if the small spines was left in it, the wound might fester, but the original poison would not be there for that is contained in a gland in the living fish situated at the base of the sting, not in the sting itself. Journal Malayan Branch [Vol. XX, Part II,</page><page sequence="6">The Malay Kěris: its origin and development 65 A stronger reason for rejecting the derivation of the kěris from the ikan pari lies in the shape of the sting : the edges on the lower part of the sting are serrated with small spines pointing upwards, towards the base, and in no type of kěris are there any such serra- tions, and the base of the sting is without the widening towards the gcvnja which is an essential characteristic of the kěris, so that «even if ikan pari stings were still in use as daggers at the time when the kěris was introduced, the pattern of the kěris was not based on the sting. If the kěris was not introduced from abroad, or copied from some other form such as a spear or fish sting, it must have been an original local invention, and this is the source ascribed to it by tradition, and the best traditions assign it to Java. The peoples of the Archipelago have not the historical sense well developed, and history and mythology have no clear boundaries between them, but something of value may be found in their stories if there is any external evidence to support them: Such evidence may be found in the sculptures of the temples in Java. Crawfurd points out that the more ancient temple sculptures - perhaps because of their 'strict adherence to a foreign costume' - show no trace of the kěris, but only depict swords and spears, but that in the temples on Mount Lawu which date from early in the 15th century there are several examples. Kaffles* says that there are sculptured kěris on the temple at Suku which, by an inscription, can be dated as 1361-1362: one slab shows a workman making a kěris and there are several blades hanging up in his ship. One tradition, with an inclination to mythology, assigns the introduction of the kěris to the Hindu King Sakutram or Sa Putram who was born with a kěris pasopati at his side: another gives it to Panji, the well-known hero of the Panji tales: this would make it about A.D. 920, which would be perhaps too early, judging by the temple sculpture evidence, but it would be natural for people of a later date to connect the national weapon with the national hero. A third variety attributes it (Crawfurd) to Inakarto Pati, King of Jang- golo, in the beginning of the 14th century A.D. which would fit in with the temple evidence. Traditions giving its origin to Bali or Celebes are too late : after the fall of the Majapahit Empire its workers in metal were scattered and the kěris became a general weapon: some of the best workmen went to these islands and news that 'the best kěris now come from Bali or Celebes' might soon become 'the kěris started there'. The attribution, given by Malacca Malays, to Hang Tuah, 1374 A.D., is merely an attempt to glorify * The Secretary of the Royal Batavia Society writes "Raffles is quite right. On the remarkable temple at Su]tuh there is a relievo, representing Bima, forging a kěris with his bare hands, using his knee as an anvil.

Woolley a local hero, ignoring the fact that the kěris was known long before his day, though he may Have made some particular pattern fashion- able in Malacca. At the other extreme, Mr. Gardner (p. 41) quotes Dr. van Stein Callenfels as saying that the her is Majapahit "belongs to the earliest iron age in Java, about the Tth century A.D. and that scarcely anything is known about it." Xo evidence is given in support of this view, and the date seems far too early, and dis- agrees with the temple sculpture evidence. The sword and spear, it would seem, were known in Java from ancient times: iron must have been imported, and without iron tools the temple sculptures could not have been made,, but there is no evidence that iron was obtained locally. Might it be not the case that Inakarto Pati or a workman at his court discovered or found out how to work the meteoric iron which is found in Java and also Celebes? Typical of the htrxs are its pi mur lines and markings and its dull rough surface: běsi pamur means 'mixed* iron, i.e. iron and nickel as in meteoric iron, and it is the nickel which causes the markings. Also in Java, as in all countries, the thunderbolt or meteorite has been supposed to possess some magic or talismanic properties (legend in Kaffles, Vol. 2 p. 137). The first Jcëris Majapahit were not suitable as actual weapons, being too small and weak, but as charms or talismans they could be valued: the hilt, in the same piece as the bladè, had the form of a deityr Vishnu, whose image would consecrate and give additional efficacy to the charm. (See PI: I. fig. 1 &amp; 2). Professor H. Balfour has suggested that these К čris Majapahit might possibly be "currency bars''. In North Borneo up to the present time brass cannon were commonly used as currency : be- fore the advent of the Chartered Company a native might be fined "one pikul" or "two pikuls" i.e. brass cannon up to that weight (one pikul = 133 lbs. taken as equivalent to $25.00 - $30.00) and for long afterwards this system was used in reckoning such things as brian (dowry). But a cannon had its own proper use in the days of piracy, and even later on, at festivals: would so much labour have been expended in making a 'currency' knife or dagger which was too weak to be used? A rough block, like the tin currency of Malaya, would be a much more probable form. The 'talisman' idea, does explain why trouble should be taken in the manufacture ; and a talisman to be kept for luck would have a market value, so there seems to be no need to suggest 'currency' at all. The keris might possibly have had a ceremonial use, just as now the Dusun women in Putatan and Papar in North Borneo carry a very orna- mental brass knife on certain ceremonial or festal occasions.

Mr. Gardner notes that modern forgeries of the Kěris Maja- pahit and Kěris Pich it were being made in Trengganu, the former tending to be larger and heavier with larger figures for the hilt : he also regards some Pieliti blades with figure hilts, as forgeries. Wavv blades of either type, he thinks, if genuine, were certainly of later make. The wavy blade in Mr. Gardner's opinion, may have been introduced from India and he quotes the ibex horn as a possible original for this type. The natural curves of this horn as shown in a drawing are certainly not unlike those of a three or five wave kěris , but the derivation seems rather far-fetched and does not suit the blade with nine or more waves, - moreover the actual horn is a corkscrew spiral and the kens, though wavy, is flat. The development and spread of the Kěris Marsden (p. 347) says that iron was smelted in Menangkabau "from the earliest times". When once the use of the local material had been discovered, it would not be long before clever workmen would find that the talisman could be made into an actual and serviceable weapon by combining it with imported iron, and we get the blade built up of strips of various metal forged and welded together: the central strip of imported iron or steel provided the sharp point and edge, and strength, whilst the local běsi pamur gave the desired appearance and markings and contributed its magic or supernatural qualities to the completed weapon. Bur- nished steel blades do occur, especially in the Sulu and Bali types, but generally were not favoured. A first rate workman could add to its beauty by chiselled or inlaid work or gold mountings, and it was also discovered that the damascening or pamur patterns could be controlled. By about the middle of the 14th century according to Raffles the art of kěris making was reaching to the highest point, at Panjajaram in Java, under the second prince of Majapahit, and the first damasked këris were being produced. The countries conquered by Majapahit became familiar with the Jcěris and began to adopt it from their conquers, whilst trade and piracy helped to spread it. Then came the fall of Majapahit and its wrorkmen were scattered, and the result of all this was that the 1947] Poyal Asiatic Society .</page><page sequence="9">68 G. С. Wool ley development of the weapon took different forms in different places, though no hard and fast line can be distinguished: the key to much of the change is to be found in the spread or influence of the Muslim (Mohamedan) religion. Crawfurd puts the conversion of the Malacca Malays at about 1276, of the Javanese at about 14 78, and the Celebes about 1510. Winstedt, History of Malaya, p. 56 says that Majapahit fell before the attacks of Muslim princes be- tween 1513 and 1522. The lines of development can be classified as follows: - (i) the Bali, Lombok and Madura type, (ii) the Java- nese, (iii) the Northern or Peninsula, (iv) the Bugis, (v) the Sumatran, (vi) the Patani, (vii) the Sulu. In all cases there the examples which are exceptional, or may be regarded as 'freaks' made to suit a special buyer, and there are small or toy weapons made perhaps for women or for boys of high birth. Kěris types. The basic type. The original talismanic Majapahit kěris had a hilt, as noted above, representing a deity, often seated, with the hand resting on the knees. The deity was probably Vishnu, or Siva : Vishnu rode on the Garuda, the roc, or a monster with the head of a bird and body of a man, and the Xagas, snakes, were their enemies. The Garuda form might easily have been used in place of Vishnu, but the cobra would not have come until the religious connection had been lost sight of, or deliberately ignored,, and the snake form adopted in view of the snake-like wavy blade and its deadly power. Hilts were of metal - gold, silver, suasa, ivory or wood. In the latter case, the ornamental kamwing wood was the favourite, and this was also used for the sampir and buntut though a plainer wood was often used for the central sarong section, especially if it was to be covered by a metal sheath. (i) The Bali, Lombok and Madura type. (See PI: II &amp; III). In these parts the Hindu religion held its ground, and on the hilt the figure of the divinity remained or, as often in Madura, became a flower with a general outline resembling that of the figure. These hilts, in silver or gold, were often massive, and very elaborate- ly carved. In its simplest form it becomes a wooden block of some- what cubist design. It is often seen without the metal perwngkok at its base. The sheath may be made of two pieces of wood fastenedi toge- ther, not with a separate sampir , and ii there is a metal casing, it may have a large grotesque mask or demon's face on one side of the sampir . A rounded outline is given to the sampir, but there is a Bali type in which the side enclosing the dagu of the blade is in Journal Malayas Brànch [Vol. XX, Part, IL</page><page sequence="10">The Malay Kěris: its origin and development 69 almost a straight line with the sheath of the main blade. The tip of the sheath is rounded. The wood chosen is often very conspi- cuous in marking, e.g. a light ground with large blotches almoöt black in colour. The blades of some of the royal kěris in the Welter vreden Museums are long, and wider than usual. The engraving of a. Madura kěris in Baffles' History of Java (Vol. I p. 296) has a hilt which might well be of the Madura type, as it seems to be a com- bination of a human (or divine) figure with floral or scroll orna- ment, but the sheath is distinctly Javanese. The hilt of one of the three Ashmolean kěris is said by Winstedt to represent Arjuna or a demigod of the Wayang Kulit cycle : it is not so heavy as the Bali hilt, and may be Madura or Java work: the figure has long hair hanging down its back : it must date from before 1656, when it had been brought to England. The blade of this kěris may also be Madura or Javanese, as the ganja hafe a fretted edge though the blade is straight. Bali blades are often smooth or polished, if not actually burnished, and the pamur shows as white or light gray patterns on a dark almost black ground. (ii) The Javanese type. Baffles says that over 100 varieties were known, and he gives a plate showing 41 of the 'common' ones with their names, which include the pasupati form - the keris with which the king Sakutram was born. Some of these are straight, some wavy, but in no case are the waves very pronounced, and many of these outlines are so similar that it would take an expert to identify an actual weapon. There is no kěris Majapahit shown,, and apparently no pic/tit , but he may have omitted these as not being 'common'. In later times the kěris Sapukal * is understood to- be a straight kěris, and kěris Sěmpana a wavy or simious one with from 3 to 7 'lok' (curves) but No. 27 on Baffles' plate, which is. slightly wavy is called sěmpana, No. 32, which is straight, is called sěmpana běnar and No. 13 which is wavy is called sapukal . Pos- sibly the engraver got his figures confused for in the previous 'plate showing the parts of the kěris and their names there is a metal ( ?) cover for a sheath marked 'No. 5', but there is No. 5 in the list of namést Crawfurd says there were 54 varieties, 21 straight and 33 wavy. Baffles also says (Vol. I p. 329) that the Java kěris is plainer than the (Peninsula) Malayan type in blade as well as in hilt and sheath. 'Plainer' should not be taken to mean 'inferior': the reputation of the Javanese work shows this, but it may mean 'greater simplicity'.

The thick squat figure seen on the Bali type disappears : the thinner upright figure with head inclined slightly forward loses its human outline and becomes a plain shape, with very little ornament, which gives a grip very much like that of a fencing foil. The Jawa děmam type may of course have been made also in Java, by Javanese work- men for Javanese use, but it is more typical of the Peninsula. As has been pointed out already, no hard and fast line can be drawn and it is best merely to say what the typical Javanese form is. Fig. 3. Front and side views of a typical Javanese Kěris Hilt. The sampir of the Javanese sheath (see PI: 1У) is of a light design, with rounded edges, somewhat boat-shaped, and this may be developed by lengthening the ends and curling them over. The sarong of the sheath is narrow, tapers a little, and is rounded at the point, sometimes with a solid tip of metal or ivory or ebony. The whole sheath up to the sampir is often cased in metal - brass, silver or gold, plain or chased, but an open panel may be left on one side, to show the ornamental grain of the wood, or be filled in with a slip of tortoise-shell or ivory.

Stutterheim in his 'Cultuurgeschiedenis van Java on Beelď gives on p. 148, 149 illustrations of the two sides of the blade of an 'old këris', which is inlaid with figures and patterns: this may he a Bali blade, or made by a Javanese smith for a man of the old Hindu religion, but may be put in the 'special' or 'freak* class, it is by no means an ordinary weapon. (iii) The Peninsula or Northern type. (See PI: V). Here too, as in later Java, we get a Muslim people, but as is so clear- ly shown in Skeat's 'Malay Magic', they were not very bigoted and were ready to overlook all sorts of pagan survivals. As the këris be- came known to them and won their approval as a weapon, they may have objected to the actual representation of a pagan divinity on the hilt, but might have been ready to compromise, in order to retain the supernatural powers of the blade, on the retention of the 'Garuda',. the bird-headed human form, but making it more of a caricature : the god's hands come off his knees - the attitude common to gods and kings in the temples of Egypt - and are folded across the stomach, the head is lowered, and we get the Jawa děmam - the man shivering with fever, but a man scarcely human enough to offend against religion. In the earlier stages the figure .may have hair carved on the back of the head : this is succeeded by the bird's crest, then the arms may be left out, and the bird's crest, then the arms may be left out, and the bird's head and eyes and beak be left out, or changed after passing through a 'cobra' phase into foliated patterns until nothing is left- of human or animal form, and only the shape of the hilt remains, as it gives an admirable grip for a weapon designed for a thrust. Gardner (Notes on two uncommon varieties of the Malay Këris) says that the seated god on the Majapahit Tcëris hilt has a sort of hat on the head, which, from behind, looks like a cobra with hood extended. The so-called 'hat', in my opinion,, is really the halo-like disc often seen in representations of the gods ; when the Garuda took the place of the god the halo became a bird's crest like a cock's comb : the cobra and cobra-hood idea, as already noted, was quite independent and occured to men who knew and cared nothing about the proper attributes of Vishnu. The cobra idea same quite early, for the këris of Muzaffar Shah of Malacca is said to be of 15th century work : it also shows, from the inscription inlaid in silver that a Muslim sultan was willing to wear a weapon with a snake on its blade. Wilkinson, dictionary s.v. ' Aring ' states that in the Peninsula fretted work under the point of the ganja is only found on sinuous blades, but that this is not the case in Java, and as authority he quotes the plate in Baffles' History of Java which shows 41 'common* varieties of blades. 1947] Royal Asiatic Society.</page><page sequence="13">72 G.

Dr. Snouck Hurgronje in his book on the Achenese says that their луеаропв were the sikin or klewang ( gliwang ), a variety of sword, and the reunpJiong or -rinchong, a single-edged knife, аш1 he does not include the këris in his list. This may be an indirect support to the theory of a Hindu-Java origin, as Acheh had early connections with the Arabs. P. 104 shows 2 Mvriss d'investiture' which are of the 'Java' type both for hilt and sheath. It may be assumed that these were imported for ceremonial use. On the other hand Menangkabau was famous for its kěris , and Newbold quotes Argensola, writing in 1609, as saying "at Menangkabau excellent poniards are made, called creeses: the best weapons of all thei Orient". No doubt the workmen turned out Kěris of Java or Peninsula type if required, but the special Sumatra variety was the kěris bah ari or kens pan jan g , a long rapier-like blade, perhaps introduced to give extra reach in an encounter with an opponent armed with a sword. The type, an encounter with an opponent armed with a sword (see PI: VII &amp; VIII). The type, once introduced, was repeated with blades of ordinary or even short length- the kěris alang and kěris pěn dek. Bahari, Wilkinson, means 'young, vernal, or is simply a complimen- tary term, e.g. zaman yang bahari 'the good old times': a Brunei Malay told me that the type, if wavy, was called Rënti, and if straight Anjur or Hanjur : he could not explain the meaning of these words, but Wilkinson (1901 ed.) gives Pënganjur as "The •officer who bears the sword of state before a Raja'. It is also called Kěris PěnyaJang because that type was generally used for executions. The bahari blade is long and narrow, sometimes flat, or diamond-shaped in section, but sometimes with a raised rib running down the middle: it may have pamur, or have a plain dull black surface, not unlike black sandpaper, but there are also cases where it has a smooth or almost burnished surface, when it called Këris 31 cíela. The Kěris Mělela belonging to the Sultan of Kelantan 19Jf 7] Royal Asiatic Society .</page><page sequence="15">74 G. С. Woolley described by Dr. Gimlette, 'Malay Poisons', p. 7, may have been: one of the shorter form of the Sumatran type : Dr. Gimlette says- it was short and straight and had no damask (běsi mëlela means undamasked steel) and was reputed, to have magic power although the lack of damask, which the meteorite běsi pamiir produced, might be thought to -involve the loss of it. The typical hilt follows the general outline of the Java pattern,, though a blade will often be found fitted with a hilt of the Jaiva děmam Peninsula type, doubtless to suit the taste of the owner. The longer Java pattern gives a better balance in the hand - more like the handle of a foil - but the plain Java design is given more- ornament, and the tip is often of a flower-like or foliated design.. The sampir of the sheath combines the Java, and Peninsula types : the two ends may be rather high, and the rest not so square and heavy as the Peninsula type. The sarong is narrow, may have a number of silver bands, and may end on a rounded point, or,, especially if metal-cased, in a square buntut. A reason for the square tip, given to me by a Brunei Malay, was that the kěris could be worn at the back, and in an emergency a kick with the heel would jerk the blade up and enable the hilt to be grasped and the blade drawn over the shoulder. Gardner mentions the same- trick, but neither of us have been able to see it demonstrated. The name Kěris Ta jan g refers to this. (vi) The Patani type. (See PI: IX). This is also called the Kěris Pěkaka or Pěkakak 'The Kingfisher'. This is reference- to the hilt, which may be derived from the bird-headed Garuda, but it is often much more like a demon, or one of the gods or demigods of the Wayang Kulit, though they do not have such long noses. It is. .worth remembering, however, that the Wayang Kulit was, and still is, very popular in Patani. Firth, 'Malay Fisherman' p. 48, speaking of some of the Kelantan boats, say that "the crutches to hold mast and sails on board when taken down are often highly sculptured in floral or bird designs, and even occasionally in the form of a figure- from the local shadow-play." Whether the Ashmolean kěris with the broken nose is to be put down to Patani or Java is open to- question. A form of hilt showing a demon head with the teeth and tusks and a long nose, though not a beak like the 'kingfisher' type, is given by Professor Bezemer in Indonesian Arts &amp; Crafts, Netherlandsch Indie, Oude en Xieuw as 'Javanese'. This may be an early type of the Kěris Patani and show a connection with the old Hindu religion and the Wayang Kulit plays. The Patani blade is fairly long, and may be almost or quite as long as a Kěris Bahari. A blade of Mr. Gardner's which is fitted with a Pěkakak hilt, has 31 waves.

Javanese in- fluence coming through Menangkabau and Sumatra, as well ás «direct, was strong in the Patani district, and may explain why a Kěris of Sumatran type with a hilt recalling the Wayang Kulit should often have been chosen rather than one of the Peninsula •юг Bugis design. (vii) The Kěris Suluk type. (See PI: X &amp; XI). This iypes is a very well defined development of the original këris in the Peninsula it even has a distinct name, the sundang, but in Borneo it is always called either kěris simply or Kěris Suluk as opposed to Kěris Jawa or Kěris Bugis . The Sulus wanted a cutting rather than a thrusting weapon, perhaps as being more suited for piratical ¿attacks at sea,- a straight heavy type the Rajah Laut- so they de- signed a new hilt} but retained the characteristic blade with a ganja. Blades. Some are still fairly short and light, but the tendency is towards extra weight and length, and the point is almost rounded. 'They may show pamur down the centre of the blade, often with a broad plain edge, or even the whole blade may be smooth if not .actually burnished: in these cases there is often a floral design or an Arabic inscription inlaid in silver. Blade are straight or wavy, .and often have a groove, or two grooves with a ridge between, run- ning down nearly to the point, with the pamur showing only in the grooves. The hilt is set at a slight angle, leaning towards the dagu, with an upward crest on the upper, aring, side and a downwards prong on the lower side, which prevents the hand from slipping. It is made of wood or ivory or metal, and the grip is bound with plaited rings of rotan or silver or brass wire. There is also a metal loop on one or both sides of the blade which is held by the r serrated edge of the aring or janggut, and is connected to a flat metal strip which runs up the hilt and is held there by the rotan or wire rings : the object is to prevent the blade from getting loose and twisting round when a blow is struck. The sheath generally has a separate sampir of Peninsula or Bugis type, but occasionally the whole sheãt is made of two pieces •of wood stuck together with bands of metal or rotan. The buntut , if there is one, is of any type, Java, Peninsula or Bugis. Kěris Manufacture. The actual process of manufacture in modern times- and there is no reason to suppose that it has changed in any essential since early days- is given by W. Rosenhäin, Notes on. Malay Metal - 1947] Royal Asiatic Society .</page><page sequence="17">76 G. С. Woolley work, Journal Authropological Institute, Vol. 31 February 190ír and again by I. H. N. Evans-, Ethnology and Archaeology of the Malay Peninsula , p. 55, and Gardner, Kěris and Other Malay Weapons . A rough summary is that strips of different metals, when welded together, make up a laminated bar and the edges of lamina- tions produce marks or lines, which are the pamur: this pattern is- finally brought out by an acid bath which eats away parts of the softer metals and may also increase its visibility by altering the colour of soma of the metals. The earliest workers could produce- hair-like lines only but later smiths found out how to control the- pamur markings and to produce any required pattern. Pamur. The nature of the pamur took an important part in deciding if a weapon was lucky or unlucky for any given purpose : one lucky for trade might be bad for war. Xewbold, British Settlements in the Straits of Malacca, Yol. 2, p. 202, gives a translation of a Malay Manuscript on this subject and Winstedťs English-Malay Dictionary, s.v. 'damask' gives a long list of names of pamur , but to attempt the compilation of a complete list, though interesting to a collector, would not repay the time and trouble involved. The names are often fanciful and based on very far-fetched analogies - e.g. "fish-navel" or "the grass hopper's legs" and probably the names varied in different districts. Xewbold gives a plate, appa- rently copied from diagrams in his Malay Manuscript showing ten forms described', but Professor W. AV. Skeat's copy of this book has pencilled notes giving different pamur names to several of them. One legend said that the straight pamur lines were derived from the hair of a girl who was sacrificed when the manufacture of the blade was begun, in order that lier spirit might enter into it.. Kěris Measurements. Various systems of measurements have been recorded by Xew- bold, Skeat, Gardner, Keith, Evans and others, but it is not neces- sary to repeat them here in detail. They fall into two classes, (a) comparative measurements depending only on the blade itself, e.g. the number of times that the width of a blade at a given place will go into its length, (b) a combination of a blade measurement writh a personal measure of the owner, e.g. the width of his thumb joint compared with the length of the blade, with a formula of the 'soldier, sailor, tinker, tailor' type. The results will show whether a blade is lucky or unlucky either in itself or for a parti- cular owner. Kěris Magic. It has already been suggested that the kěris in its original form in Majapahit had a magical or talismanic value rather than as Journal Malayan Branch [Vol. XX, Part, II..</page><page sequence="18">The Malay Kěris: its origin and development 77 ■an actual weapon, being made from meteoric ore with supernatural -qualities, strengthened by the figure of the god on the hilt. It •cannot have been long, however, before the smiths thought of add- ing other metals and so forming a serviceable weapon. The intro- duction of Islam was bound to modify this: the figure of the god himself had to go, but, if one was not too strict, some type of monster or jin might be allowed, and be as efficent: the běsi pamur , the supernatural ore, could still be used, and power be ascribed to the foreign metal: a kěris must have three kinds of iron, a good keris would have more : the kěris of Hang Tuah was made up of 20 kinds, and in the story books tht steel of the hero's Mris was taken from "what was left over from the making of the bolt of the Ka'aba at Mecca" : it could kill a man if driven into his foot- prints in the sand, or poison the fish at the river's mouth if washed in the headwaters. An Islamic magic could thus replace the Hindu, and the head of the deadly cobra could supersede the Garuda either •deliberately or by a mistaken identification. Skeat, Malay Magic , p. 4, quotes from a Malay charm book's account of the Creation, which describes a very anthropomorphic serpent, perhaps related to the Indian Xagas which in old sculptures are represented as having human form with a snake attached to their back and its hooded head rising behind their necks. Some such figure may have ¡suggested to a Malay workman the Jawa demain type of hilt, which varies from an accurate representation of the human form to one in which nothing but the hood is recognisable. A kěris bertuali might wound or destroy a man if it was merely pointed at him : the Bali carved kěris holders all hold the kěris point downwards; when on Malay ceremonial occasions, a kěris Avas carried on a cushion it must have pointed somewhere, but as it was not held in the hand the magic power perhaps was not evoked. McXair (p. 304) quotes an edict by the Sultan of Menang- kabau, the preamble of which describes him as possessed of "a kěris formed of the soul of steel, which by a noise expresses its unwilling- ness at being sheathed, and shows itself pleased when drawn : of a date co-eval with the creation." The old stories of the 'poisoned' kěris may also have been started h y these stories of its magic power. There is no clear evidence that blades were actually poisoned, even in older times, though poison was used for arrows and blow-pipe darts. The roughness of the hlade, would naturally cause a rather jagged and dangerous wound, iind the acids and sulphur and arsenic which were used in the manu- facturing and cleaning processes might well tend to make any wound septic. Kěris in the regalia. Tn spite of the respect paid to it and the powers attributed to it, the kěris had sometimes to give place 1947] Royal Asiatic Society.</page><page sequence="19">78 G. С. Woolley to the sword and spear, perhaps because the latter was the older weapon but Curtis seems to go too far when he says that for this- reason the hěris, though a royal weapon, does not form part of any coronation regalia. The Malay Annals, it is true, do not include- a Iceris in the list of Perak regalia, but Swettenham (British Malaya p. 210) gives a photograph of 'Perak regalia' which shows four. Skeat (Malay Magic p. 26) includes a Këris Panjang, the Běroh Ыгауип, in the Selangor regalia and in Jelebu a sword pedang pěmanchor and a hěris panjang . Caldecot says that the iceris pěhaha of Jelebu was named Sigar jantan - why, he could not say, but no unimportant weapon would have a special name : this Iceris was also associated with a spirit called Biring Běrhilang who guarded the Pěnghulus of Jelebu. Newbold records a hěris said to have come from Majapahit, in the regalia of the Bali State of Kloukong, and Collet illustrates a. 'Kris d'investiture' from Acheh. Perhaps a distinction should be drawn between articles actually used in the Installation ceremony (tabal) and those brought out on other state occasions. In Bembau (Parr and Macray, Journal of the S.B.R.A.S. No. 51) the IJndang might display a naked Iceris panjang, and at an Undang's funeral four naked straight-bladed Iceris panjang are displayed in court-yard. Wilkinson, Papers on Malay Subjects. Life and Customs, Pt. 1 states that 'at. his Coronation a Sultan wears. . . .a gold-sheathed hěris, a golden-hilted sword and a silver seal. A Perak prince at his wedding does not wear the two last : the reason is breast orna- ments, bracelets and hěris are true regalia: the sword and seal are dynastic heirlooms, so the bridegroom does not copy them/ Winstedt, Papers 'on Malay Subjects, Life and Customs, Pt. I p. 74 says that the Sultan of Perak must wear the Kěris pesiaba at his installation, though the sword Ohura si-man jahim is the most important of the all the regalia. The hěris , which had no tradition or history attached to it, was also known as Kěris těrjewa loh lima . The Wearing of the Kěris. The anonymous Historical Description of Macassar says 'Some- times 2 Grits are carried, one in each hand, that is the left is used for guarding/ very much, one might think, as in the European 'sword and dagger' duels* Skeat has a note that Malays never, as a rule, carry more than two, one long and one short. Raffles (Vol. II p. 91) says that the Javanese, in full war costume, carry three, one on each side and one behind, one being a weapon of his own selection, one a pěsaha heirloom, and one given to him on his marriage by his father-in-law, this last being worn on the left side for immediate use. Chester states that in the Peninsula it Journal Malayan Branch [Yol. XX, Part, II.</page><page sequence="20">The Malay Kěris: its origin and development 79 is the kěris of the man's own choice which is worn on the left side. In ordinary dress, Raffles (see PI: XII, XIII &amp; XIV) says that -every Javanese carries one kěris, and in Court dress a Joiife of the kind called wedung is worn on the left side and one kěris stuck in the waist band, behind on the right side: in his illustration the kěris hilt projects in front of the right elbow. In other plates he shows 'a Madurese' wearing the kěris behind but with its hilt projecting behind the wearer's left .arm and 'A Regent of Java, in undress' wears it behind. Crawfurd, History of Indian Archipelago, I p. 213, says 'in full dress, 2 or 3 or even 4 kěris are worn : their value ánd beauty are a test of тапк and wealth'. In a photograph published in a Japanese paper in 1943 or 1944 showing the three great princes of Java at a meet- ing with the Japanese C. in C. or Governor of Java, each wears a short kěris , perpendicular, in his belt at the middle of his back. The laws of Malacca - and doubtless other states had their own similar regulations - laid down rules as to who might wear a kěris with a gold hilt or sheath encased in gold, when the tip of the hilt was to be worn, in peaceful fashion, turned towards the body, or when, ready for action, with the tip pointing outwards, and again when,, at Court, the hilt was to be concealed under a fold of the sarong. Execution by the kěris. In some cases the Sultan sent his own kěris to be used at an execution, to signify his consent or approval. The condemned man was made to sit but there was no rule as to his being bound : in some cases an assistant may have stood on either side, holding an arm. The executioner stood behind, and placed the point of the kěris on a small pad of cotton-wool behind or over the collar boné on the left side (Newbold, Vol. I p. 237, describes an actual case when the kěris was used on the right side - perhaps the executioner chose whichever was more convenient to himself) the blade being held perpendicular, and it was then driven down to the heart. The sentence may have directed that the thrust should be made quickly or slowly. The use of the cotton-wool was important, it was to prevent a flow of blood, and was held in place with one hand as the blade was withdrawn. Caldecot, in his paper on Jelebu states that only the Ruler could use the beheading sword for executions, as it shed blood: the Pěnghulu could use the kěris with its pad of wool. Acknowledgements.
