<plain_text><page sequence="1">LIFE OF THE FLYCATCHER. American Natural History Series, Volume 3. By Alexander F Skutch; illustrated by Dana Gardner. Norman (Oklahoma): University of Oklahoma Press. $40.00. xiii + 162 p + 16 pi; ill.; index. ISBN: 0-8061-2919-0. 1997. This is another in a series of general volumes by Skutch on the natural history of an avian group, in this case the family Tyrannidae. The text includes chapters on foraging, daily activities, song, court- ship, nests, care of eggs, care of young, enemies, and a final one on flycatchers as neighbors. Skutch's accessible writing style provides a considerable amount of interesting observations on this New World family. However, despite a bibliography, the lack of citations in the body of the book often makes it impossible to determine whether Skutch is relat- ing personal observations or information from pub- lished literature. Although this style makes the book less than valuable as a scientific tool, there is much of worth to students of birds and those inter- ested in general natural history. Much of this infor- mation, however, is presented as anecdotes with an anthropomorphic view (e.g., "[s]uch greetings, widespread in the family, appear to be expressions of an emotional temperament," p 56). Most curious, but not surprising considering the author, is the revisionism Skutch employs in his at- tempt to rid the family of the "tyrant" label to which he objects strongly and considers to be undeserved. In his view, rather than tyrants, flycatchers are good neighbors in part because they "repulse animals that menace their neighbors or their neighbors' nests" and "they also occasionally help birds of dif- ferent species to rear their young" (p 141). A result of this nomenclature purge is that pied water- tyrants become pied water-flycatchers and the beardless tyrannulets become the less descriptive beardless flycatchers. Another shortcoming that could easily have been remedied is the tendency to avoid current subjects of interest to biologists in favor of relating stories. For example, in the chapter on eggs and incubation, Skutch informs the reader that "[s]uch premature covering of eggs leads to sequential rather than simultaneous hatching" (p 90). As in several other cases where the opportunity arises to present current views on the utility of a behavior, rather than present ideas about hatching asynchrony or brood reduction (not even the famil- iar terms are used), Skutch remains phenomeno- logical to a fault. Skutch has clearly written this volume for a gen- eral audience that will appreciate his latest effort.
