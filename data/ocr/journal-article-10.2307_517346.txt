<plain_text><page sequence="1">Chaucerian Belief: The Poetics of Reverence and Delight. By JOHN M. HILL. Pp. xiv+204. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1991. ?18-95. It is the good fortune of Chaucer critics that he did not live to complete The Canterbury Tales nor find time amid the duties of Deputy Forester to compose a treatise on poetics. His views on this last can only be inferred from his practice taken in conjunction with a few scattered remarks made in the course of poetic composition. In the case of an uncompleted and fragmentary work like The Canterbury Tales, matching imperfect practice to piecemeal theory has furnished material for copious hypotheses of the nature of Chaucer's literary intentions. Professor Hill deals principally with Fragments V, VII, and IX of Robinson's edition, but devotes his first two chapters to clearing the thickets of previous opinions. He is sceptical that Chaucer had an integrated plan for the work and shuns both thematic and dramatic attempts at unification. But he does not adopt a rigorously textualist posture, concerned only with matters of style or discourse structure. Indeed his attitude to the linguistic medium is as anthropomorphic as Kittredge's, but in a different way. Primarily, the text creates not personalities to match the portraits of the General Prologue, but voices which adumbrate the interaction of tellers with tales. Crucial to Chaucer's concern with tales is their truth value, and the passages in the Legend of Good Women, G Prologue, 30-5 and 81-8 which use the words beleve, credence, reverence, and delit in the context of story reception, provide a key to Chaucer's poetics, and supply a title for the book. Equally important is affective response, where feeling is seen as an initial require-</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 563 ment, preceding the above responses. In the discussion of the tale of Melibee, prudence emerges as significant too, since 'to read prudently is to read "debonairly," in an openness of spirit and feeling, not narrowly in a self-reflecting or self-serving way, not hastily, not angrily, not covetously' (p. 125) as some tellers encounter their tales. Chaucer's poetics, it is argued, presupposes an open-minded reader, capable of delight and feeling. There is indeed much to be said for such a view, but to justify it requires much more argument than the author seems prepared to offer. Why is it, for example, that when building a conception of his poetics, these particular passages on reader response are so privileged by comparison with Chaucer's other literary references? Are there extrinsic parallels for similar literary ideas? It would be encouraging to see the hypothesis more fully supported. Interpretation of the attitudes of fictional narrators requires reading of such stylistic subtlety that it must approximate the linguistic intuitions of a contemporary native speaker, and therefore calls for persuasive analysis. The commentary upon the tales and their telling is in most respects adequate, sometimes percipient and pungent, but not surprisingly falls well short of this convincing demonstration. There are moments, too, when the clarity of the thesis becomes obscured by allusive or overgeneralized statement. It is true that the Shipman's Tale is notorious for its puns, real or wished-for, but it is certainly untrue that the word plow is there used with sexual connotation (p. 95): money is the merchants' plough in ironic contrast to a traditional symbol of productivity. The conduct of the argument is not always clear: after forswearing the General Prologue as a source for the personalities of his tellers, the author describes the Squire as 'a youthful rhetor with little or no interest in love' (p. 75). The reference to youth, however, comes from the General Prologue not the Tale. It cannot be inferred from the link in which he is patronized by the Franklin, since this is used for other purposes in the Hengwrt MS, and may not have been intended as part of his characterization. Yet the statement consciously rejects the most outstanding characteristic of the Squire of the Prologue. Idiosyncratic interpretation of the manuscript tradition also leads to stated admiration (p. 100) for Chaucer's skill in prefixing the serious matter of Fragment VII with the fabliau tale of the Shipman. The unintended and unjustified implication seems to be that Chaucer composed the constant fragments somewhat in the manner of the chapters of a book. In summary, this is an interesting attempt to exploit a new perspective on Chaucer's poetry, but not nearly as convincingly argued as could be wished. University of Sheffield J. D.
