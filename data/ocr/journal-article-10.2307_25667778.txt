<plain_text><page sequence="1">HEGEL'S AESTHETICS. [With the present number is completed Mr. Bryant's translation of the most interesting portion of Hegel's ^Esthetics ? the part in which he characterizes the three great epochs of Art, corresponding to the three great divisions of the world-history. Not only Art, but the philosophy of history and of religion, may be seen in this trea tise. Mr. Bryant proposes to reprint his translation in a book form?making a work of nearly two hundred large pages. It will</page><page sequence="2">400 The Journal of Speculative Philosophy. form by far the best work in English on ^Esthetics, and could be used to advantage in colleges, high schools, and seminaries as a text-book. The first part of the translation follows Benard's French translation, the original German being constantly consulted, while the latter part is translated from the German direct. Mr. Bryant furnishes the following notice of the complete work of Hegel, published in three volumes in German, and in five volumes in French. ? Ed.] The entire work of Hegel's ^Esthetics is divided into three por tions. The first treats of the Ideal in Art. The idea of the beauti ful is here philosophically accounted for, its characteristics fully traced, and the course of its development foreshadowed. The second division treats of the Development of the Ideal in the Various Forms of Art. The profound historical significance of prt is here fully set forth. Art-activity is but one phase of the develop ment of spirit. ^Esthetics is, therefore, but one branch of the Phi 16sophy of Spirit. Hence, the forms developed by aesthetic endeavor will be found to conform to the successive stages of the develop ment of spirit. During the early period of human history, the spirit of man was crude, and, so to speak, altogether in the potential mode. Here, thought could at best be but vague and abstract. Properly speaking, it could not as yet be said to be expressed; it was only vaguely suggested in sensuous form. Such sensuous forms, vaguely manifesting spirit, are symbols. The Orient ? the cradle of the race ? and, above all, Egypt, is the land of the symbol. But, with the progress of spirit, the inadequacy of these forms becomes apparent. Man gradually recognizes himself as a spiritual being, and the higher powers as intelligences. Let us say : " As man became more godlike, the gods became more human." Thought became at once definite and finite, and it here found its perfectly adequate expression in the finite human form. This is the stage of the absolute perfection of sensuous beauty. Form and Idea are now, for a moment in the world's history, absolutely blended; and the product is Greek Plastic Art. It is manifest, however, that the infinitely progressive spirit of man must ultimately pass beyond this stage of finite sensuous thought. Finite divinities can be supreme only for a limited period. The vigor of Greek thought itself, indeed, was quite sufficient to transcend this limited sphere, and to reach and fairly grasp the con ception of the necessary, absolute, self-differentiating unity of the</page><page sequence="3">Notes and Discussions. 401 Supreme. Thus Idea is once more separated from Form. Chris tianity completed the realization of this conception, but in such wise as to afford abundant material for art. The absolute, divine One was manifested sensuously in an actual human being. The anthropo morphism of Greek religion, and hence of Greek Art also, was dis solved onty to give place to an anthropomorphism of a vastly higher significance. With the Greeks, man discovered in himself the ideal of his gods. Christianity shows man that* his own infinite Ideal is found realized in the one supreme Divinity. The human and the divine are now united by an absolute bond ? a spiritual bond ? and the beauty which art seeks in this new realm is, above all, the beauty of the spirit. The art which develops within this sphere is thus appropriately styled Christian, or Romantic Art. We have thus three necessary stages of the development of spirit, and three fundamentally distinct phases of art corresponding sever ally thereto. With three strides, the dwarf of Hindu mythology takes possession of the world. The dwarf proves to be Vishnu, who is, indeed, first of all the Preserver, but who also wields and embodies within himself both the destructive power of Siva and the creative energy of Brahma. Spirit, dwarfish and impotent at the out set, so soon as it realizes and formulates its own demands, speedily reveals its godlike might, and proves, in its ultimate potency, to be itself both the universal solvent and the vital element of the world. The third part of the ^Esthetics presents the System, of the Par ticular Arts. Of this third part we can here say little more than that it is but the carrying out, in detail, of the system presented in the second general division, as the second is itself foreshadowed and contained in germ in the first. Architecture, with its abstract mathematical forms and vast, pon derous masses, is peculiarly adapted to symbolism. Sculjiture, still occupying the three dimensions of space, yet solves the problem of reducing heavy matter to the most exquisitely refined representation of the human form, which, of all sensuous forms, is the most per fect and most beautiful manifestation of spirit. Form and content, spirit and its manifestation, are here viewed as constituting one and the same simple totality. It is the point of mediation between the simple, abstract infinity of symbolism and the concrete, vital infi nity of the Romantic World. Painting possesses, in respect of its material, practical freedom from the law of gravity; to it belong the powerful effects of color, the magic of light and shade, and the twor fold miracle of perspective. These render it capable of satisfying 2 6 .

Hence, it was only after the human spirit had reached the profoundly concrete stage of a well-defined and vital faith in the per sonal immortality of the individual, with all that is implied by this, that the utmost capabilities of this richly endowed form of art were called into activity, and its loftiest achievements realized. Painting is thus a distinctively Christian, or Romantic form of art. Its highest pur pose is to express spiritual beauty, independent of, and often in opposition to, sensuous beauty; nay, at times, even by means of the physically ugly and repulsive. Of Music and Poetry we can here permit ourselves to utter but a single word, and that mainly by way of comparing the one with the other. Music wholly rejects sensuous form from its products. Poetiy retains such forms, but presents them only for the imagina tion, through the subtle medium of language. Speaking generally, music may be said to be the more subjective of the two, since in its realization it is a series of states of the soul. Poetry, on the con trary, is more objective, since it excites definite images, which appear to the imagination as external realities. Music may, in short, in comparison with poetry, be called the manifestation of spirit under the passive form of feeling, while poetry is the manifestation of spirit under the active form of intellectual comprehension. But both are, in their range, commensurate with the entire range of the human spirit, in so far as spirit manifests itself under appropriate sensuous form. They are the wings on which the human phantasy first fluttered from its nest, and which carry the full-fledged imagina tive spirit nearest the sun of truth. Music expresses, with exquisite exactitude, every phase of feeling, from the simplest to the subtlest. It is the absolute philosophy of the emotions. Poetry expresses, with equal power and skill, every phase of thought, from the child-like fancies of the Arcadian shepherd to the loftiest conceptions within the range of imagery. This immense range and subtlety of power to sensuously manifest spirit, proves the superiority of these two forms of art over the arts of visible representation; and of these two, poetry; as the more active and virile, must unquestionably be recognized as holding the first rank. Thus, from architecture to poetry we have an ascending series, at each progressive stage of which there is less dependence upon the material, and greater power to express the spiritual.</page><page sequence="5">Notes and Discussions. 403 It is, of course, impossible, in so brief a compass, to more than dimly indicate the direction of the current of thought in this extra ordinary work, which, in the second (German) edition, extends through three volumes, containing, in all, more than 1,600 closely printed pages, throughout which is exhibited the compact style for which Hegel is noted. It is, besides, written with great clearness and force, and often with genuine eloquence and beauty. Wm. M. Bryant. St. Louis, Mo., August, 1879.</page></plain_text>
