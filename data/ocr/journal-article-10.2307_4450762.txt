<plain_text><page sequence="1">Classical Animal Tracks, Wildlife Footage and Classic Rock-n-Roll. Environmental Media Corporation. (1102 11th St., Port Royal, SC 29935- 2304; http://wws.envmedia.com; (800) 368-3382). A collection of 29 different short segments on VHS Video. Retail $89.95. This video is a collection of short, well edited clips of dif- ferent animals set to carefully chosen, upbeat classic rock selections. It is intended for fourth grade audiences and older. It is equally appropriate for the educational entertainment of high school and adult groups. Each clip features one of the 29 different wild animals: penguin, wilde- beest, mute swan, alligator, meerkat, tiger, hummingbird, albatross, ant, chimpanzee, kangaroo, elephant, squirrel, hippo, frogs and toads, bat, seal, giraffe, owl, hare, macaw, fla- mingo, whale, polar bear, lion, otter, coral, vulture, and red deer. As the animal clip runs and the music plays, short written phrases present educa- tional information about the animals portrayed. Many of the phrases are anthropomorphic and some are diffi- cult for children and non-native English speakers to quickly and entirely comprehend. The video is still useful because phrases are not needed to appreciate and enjoy the colorful, diverse, and beautifully edited animal video footage. Since no consistent themes are perused within or between clips, the instructor has the freedom and task of devising effective lessons or activities. Unlike most narrated videos, the unique, general nature of this product allows it to be used for teaching a wide range of topics by a creative biology teacher. Footage on many ecol- ogy and natural history topics can be found. A small, black and white, text only, 60-page Teaching Guide is included with the video. A three-page Introduc- tion provides a suggested listing of AAAS science benchmarks that the video can be used to cover. Addition- ally, each video selection is described in the Teaching Guide. Each descrip- tion includes the animal's common and scientific name; the song and artist performing; the animal's Phylum, Class, Order and Family; the written phrases appearing on the video; brief natural history trivia complementing each of the phrases; and a short bibliography. Overall, the video is a good general resource for exploring topics such as animal diversity, classification, ecol- ogy, and animal behavior. Fourth graders through adults will enjoy the high quality video and upbeat music. This video can be used to enhance a lesson with live footage but does not provide enough information to be use- ful as a complete lesson. Though the facts are more trivia than a balanced natural history account, the Teaching Guide aids in navigation of the video and is a fine starting point for fur- ther research.
