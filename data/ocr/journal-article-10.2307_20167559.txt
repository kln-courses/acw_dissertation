With the recent Indian migrations to the United States, for example, Venkateshvara (Lord of the Seven Hills) of Tirupati has moved abroad, to such cities as Pittsburgh, and closer to my home, to Cary, North Carolina. The rapid spread of the International Krishna Consciousness, better known as the Hare Krishna movement, has resulted in the globalization of Krishna's temples. The internationalization of Krishna worship created the demand for the exportation of the deity through his images, typically made in the workshops at Jaipur and dispersed throughout the world, a kind of divine globe trotting that is characteristic of the last quarter of the twentieth century. The gods accompanied South Asian pilgrims to America in search of its dizzying array of intellectual and economic opportunities, to newly emerging centers of power and prosperity. As they have expanded their spheres of influence and commanded obeisance at their new destinations, a new pilgrimage (tirthayatra) network has transformed this site of work and wages (karmabhumi) into a sacred territory for its newly settled Hindu population. Their travels and travel itineraries are actively being transformed into a genre of diasporic sacred travel literature, site biographies, and pilgrimage pamphlets that are savored by devotees. Travels of the divine, of course, are not a new phenomenon, but have merely taken a new dimension and hitherto unprecedented destinations. They have ancient origins as described in Puranic literature, and in ritual practices such as festival processions. Correspondingly, travels of devotees have taken the form of circumambulation (pradakshina) of the deity and temple, and of pilgrimage for contact with the divine presence. The sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries were equally distinguished by journeys to faraway and unknown lands, travels that led to conquests, adventures that brought home exotic souvenirs, and provided the impetus for a new genre of travel writing. Here too the divine followed in the wake of these expanding horizons. Within South Asia, the Mughal dynasty expanded its direct control and larger sphere of influence to the eastern and western reaches of the subcontinent, gathering exotica from these parts to fashion its image, and in turn reshaping that of the Hindu gods residing within their realm. Mughal prosperity was in part assured by the prolific travels of armies, diplomats, merchants, cultural convoys, and saints on the paths crisscrossing their expanding territory. Similar means were employed to establish British colonial authority from the mid-eighteenth century onward. These were also times when the gods traveled, from the nexuses of earlier Hindu control, following the shifts in population and power. They negotiated new conditions, adjusting to the changed circumstances when Hindu rulers were no longer the land's highest political and economic authority and making the most of opportunities as they arose. To consider the broad implications of globetrotting gods, I would like to turn to one such peripatetic deity whose sojourns provide an insight into the means by which journeys, adaptations to new surroundings, and negotiations between god and the community are accomplished. Along these lines I trace the travels of Madan Mohan (Krishna as enchanter of the god of love), a peripatetic eastern Indian deity, as he endeared himself to the local populace of Vishnupur, the seat of the Mallas, local kings who controlled southwestern Bengal, and an important center of the Gaudiya Vaishnava devotional community coalescing in the seventeenth century. Madan Mohan subsequently moved to the colonial mercantile center emerging in Calcutta in the eighteenth century, where he graced a Bengali merchant's urban household with his presence, around which a neighborhood gradually coalesced. The journeys thus culminate in the formation of sacred centers. The processes of architectural construction, ritual worship, and oral narratives about his miraculous Reba Basu first alerted me to the seemingly competing tales about Madan Mohan by confessing to ambiguities in her knowledge of them. Purabi Basu and her son Rana took me one Sunday morning to meet her neighbors Ruby and Mohanlal Mitra of Bagh Bazar. These descendants of Gokul Mitra and their priest Subrata Pujari generously shared their time and pujas with me. Joanne Waghorne and Leela Prasad urged me to think harder about the implications of many of the narratives I had collected. Dorothy Verkerk matched my collection of tales with equally vibrant ones from the medieval European world. Mary Sheriff introduced me to the pleasures of literature on travel in the eighteenth century.</page><page sequence="3">106 RES 41 SPRING 2002 acts, whereby he settled in these towns, are also successful techniques for community formation at these sites. The tales and temples reveal contestation and negotiation between king and merchant revolving around their claims upon the deity image, which resulted in the duplication of the earthly body of the divine. This replication discloses anxieties about authenticity, identity, and locality formation. In tracing the travels of a peripatetic deity, I explore the acts and tales of transformation that accrue to his sculpted body, and how that object in turn reshapes its physical environment and cultural space. As temples and their deities are closely tied to sustaining religious institutions and royal houses, they are vulnerable to political and ideological changes, despite the privileging of the moment of their making in art historical literature until recently.1 As Michael W. Meister has asserted: "... a temple is not simply a structure, nor of one period or even one community. It moves through time, collecting social lightning and resources. It must be repositioned constantly to survive. If it serves one king, it may die with that king. Let each tell its long story: both temples and the communities they serve continually redefine their pasts and renegotiate the present. That is what they are" (Meister 2000:40). Temple deities are equally susceptible, and hence fascinating for their strategies for survival and the rich narratives they acquire in the process. I trace the physical practice of reproduction, in this case literally duplication, by which a devotional community in a new center defined itself in relation to an older one, and in part gained legitimacy by establishing continuities through the physical presence of the divine image. The social practices of change include travel and a range of ritual activity, as recorded in oral and written site-based narratives, divine biographies, and the physical evidence of the sculpted body of Madan Mohan and his homes in the temple complexes of Vishnupur and Calcutta.2 A biographical approach to the object thus yields a discussion of the nature of the embodied deity, its materiality, duplicability, portability, and inscription of locality, which contribute toward its d?mystification, that is, production of resonance in Stephen Greenblatt's terms.3 Re-engaging the dialogues that objects embody as they move through different locations and shifting political and cultural contexts helps diminish the rarefication and inaccessibility of art by challenging the centrality of connoisseurly approaches, and the privileging of origins rather than biographies of objects, as does expanding the repertoire of works deemed worthy of art historical contemplation. The Raja's son: Prince of Vishnupur In 1765, the local British administrator of Vishnupur, J. Z. Hollwell, observed: "There are, in this precinct, no less than three hundred and sixty considerable Pagodas or places of worship, erected by the Rajah and his ancestors" (Holwell 1766-1771:197-198). Of all the deities housed in these temples, it was Madan Mohan (figs. 1-3) who came to preside as the lord of Vishnupur. To this day the town is imbued with his presence, and retains the imprint of his miracles. This presence is demonstrated in two ways: by Madan Mohan's direct involvement with the townspeople and by his interaction with the town's natural topographic features and architectural forms. One popular episode recounted from the life of the deity is that of the miraculous mobilization of the stone chariot built by Raja Raghunath Sinha (1627-1656). In his compassion, Madan Mohan stopped the wheels of his chariot from moving as he waited for his last devotee, an old woman who was traveling on foot from a faraway village, to arrive for the celebration of Ratha Yatra, the chariot 1. For discussions of the journeys of South Asian works of art and their precariousness, signified by the marks they bear, their removal from original contexts, and deformation, see Linda (1988), Williams (1986), Davis (1999). 2. Anthropologist Samuel Parker's observations about the construction of a temple tower are equally applicable to the social processes surrounding the sculpted bodies of such temple deities: "In actual, historically contextualized practice, people occupying different positions in society may claim authority to define the significance of an object on different grounds, making meaning a matter of conflict, cooperation, and negotiation ... the physical practices of reproducing a material form provide a background of historical continuity, while the social practices controlling its reproduction and defining its semiotic significance within changing historical circumstances constitute a significant force for transformation." (1992:110-123, 115). 3. Greenblatt called for "attempt[s] to reduce the separation of individual "masterpieces," to illuminate the conditions of their making, to disclose the history of their appropriation and the circumstances in which they come to be displayed, to restore tangibility, the openness, the permeability of boundaries that enabled the objects to come into being in the first place." To do so, he distinguishes between resonance and wonder: "By resonance I mean the power of the displayed object to reach out beyond its formal boundaries to a larger world, to evoke in the viewer the complex, dynamic cultural forces from which it has emerged and for which it may be taken by a viewer to stand. By wonder I mean the power of the displayed object to stop the viewer in his or her tracks, to convey an arresting sense of uniqueness, to evoke an exalted attention" (1991 ).</page><page sequence="4">Ghosh: Sojourns of a peripatetic deity 107 Figure 2. Priest Sushanta Mukhopadhyay attending upon Madan Mohan and Radha during the annual celebration commemorating the arrival of the saint Srinivas who initiated the Vaishnava transformation of the region. Photograph by the author. festival (fig. 4).4 This narrative binds the stone chariot at the foot of the double stone gateways into the old fort to the primary deity of the town. Another episode, perhaps the best known of Madan Mohan's feats, was his defense of the town from the historic bargi (Maratha) raids of the 1740s. While the town gathered in his temple to chant the names of Krishna, Madan Mohan is believed to have galloped on a red horse to the edge of the fort and fired the royal cannons Dal and Madal that dispersed the light artillery of the Maratha troops. Again the deity is integrally tied to the extant cannon and therefore the urban fabric. I heard this story first from Mrs. Salil Singh, a daughter-in law of the Vishnupur Raj family (Oral communication, Vishnupur, 12/1995). From the doorway of the palace complex, she pointed to the red dusty road winding its way down to the fort gates, explaining that he had charged down that path raising the dust while her father in-law's father's father, the raja, prayed at Madan Mohan's Temple at the other end of town. By association with the deity, these material forms and events from historically verifiable moments are invested with sacred authority that elevates them from their location in history to mythic status. By extension, the town of Vishnupur is afforded the same standing as Madan Mohan's abode. The narrative continues. On his way home from vanquishing the marauding Maratha troops, Madan Mohan encountered a cowherder who was carrying yoghurt to the market. He stopped the man, explained he was exhausted and hungry, and begged to eat some of the yoghurt. When the question of payment arose, he assured the poor man it would not be an issue since he was a royal prince of Vishnupur (Bishnupurer rajputtur). He then proceeded to devour all the man's sixteen mauns of yoghurt, an enormous amount that no mortal could possibly have consumed. At the end of the meal, when he departed, the clay vessels were transformed to gold, enriching the cowherder by his generosity. This episode underscores the accessibility of the deity, an essential premise of bhakti (expressive devotion) worship. In this tradition the relationship of the devotee to the divine can be conceived in five ways: as worshipper of the omnipotent deity (ishwara), as servant to the lord, as friend to friend, as parent to child, and above all as lover to the beloved. By asserting his familial ties to the ruling family as its crown prince, 4. I first heard this account from Achintya Banerjee, a local scholar and tour guide, Vishnupur 5/26/1994.</page><page sequence="5">108 RES 41 SPRING 2002 llPill Figure 3. Madan Mohan Temple, Vishnupur. Photograph by the author. Madan Mohan expresses his relationship with the king as one of a child who will be loved, cared for, and protected by the parent. The deflection of payment suggests the king's responsibility in this regard. As the king's son, however, Madan Mohan shares his obligation to protect his people and hence substituted for him on the battlefield. Simultaneously, as the attentive lord, he rewards the king for his devotion. The second part of the narrative points to the availability of the deity to all, not simply the ruler. In devouring the yoghurt he interacts with the townsfolk, and in this case he is mistaken for one of them. Movement therefore becomes a way for the deity to express his immediacy. The choice of yoghurt as the food consumed reinforces Madan Mohan's identity as Krishna, who was born into a cowherding family in Mathura, and one of whose most famous exploits described visually and orally throughout India was the stealing of dairy products from his mother's kitchen. The Madan Mohan Bandana, a lengthy poem from the eighteenth century extolling the deity's heroism and influence, possibly the oldest surviving written account, reflects this conflation.5 The description of each miracle performed by Madan Mohan culminates in the couplet: "This Vishnupur became Gupta VrindavanA/Vhere resides Lord Madan Mohan." The poem thus suggests that Madan Mohan's exploits are comparable to those of Krishna in Vrindavan, and that their occurrence transformed Vishnupur into a sacred center, a new (nava) Vrindavan.6 The Madan Mohan Temple's walls are sheathed with exquisite terra cotta panels that recount these adventures of Krishna, reinforcing the identity of the local lord Madan Mohan as the universal deity Krishna (fig. 5). Visual, oral, and written narrative was thus employed to retain legitimacy of the town's distinctive status as Madan Mohan's abode. The power of these mythic narratives is evidenced in their evocation to this day by local residents to legitimate Madan Mohan's sustained personal relationship with them. They continue to be sung as kirtana in the courtyard of the Madan Mohan Temple during evening 5. Kaviraj MS 324. 6.

Photograph by the author. arati (the final service of the day); the reiteration reinforces the identity of Madan Mohan and Vishnupur for the local community through performance. Here the conviction remains strong that Madan Mohan is jagrata (awake and alert) to attend to the needs of his followers. His priest, Sushanta Mukhopadhyay, is convinced that the deity's far-reaching influence alone maintains this community-patronized temple, drawing the generous donations to this temple from not just devotees of neighboring districts but from Benares and Vrindavan in north India (Oral communication, Vishnupur, 12/1995). These contributions go toward his lavish clothes and jewelry as well as the daily offerings of rice and lentils that feed the town's poor.

Like them, he sways with his weight on one hip, his body curving rhythmically. The right leg is poised momentarily in front of the left, as if pausing in his dance. His head is bent, mesmerized by the sound of his flute, as is his beloved Radha. Ritual activity, however, establishes the hierarchy of the town's gods. At specific times in the festival calendar, all the other deities pay homage to Madan Mohan. During the annual festival celebrating the founding of the town, for example, all the deities of the 7. However, there are differences in size, details of slippers, girdles, and earrings for instance. Further, while some images are carved from dark gray phyllite, others are molded from metal.</page><page sequence="7">110 RES 41 SPRING 2002 Figure 6.

After each is installed in a temporary altar along the temple plinth and that of the natmandir (hall for entertainment located across from the temple at the opposite end of the courtyard) Madan Mohan's priest leads those of the other gods in the arati (daily evening acts of service). Each of the offered items?water in a conch shell, lighted lamp lotus, fly whisk, cloth and lotus blossom? are waved ceremonially before the gods. Similarly, other festivals are initiated by a symbolic gesture from Madan Mohan. During Holi, the spring celebration of colors, Madan Mohan's feet are the first to be painted with red powder. While other deities ride out in their chariots during the annual celebration of Ratha, the chariot festival, Madan Mohan simply goes from his sanctum up the stairs to the pavilion above. He observes the town's celebrations from there. Again, it is his visit to the festival pavilion that inaugurates the chariot rides of the others. These acts allow Madan Mohan to maintain his status as presiding deity, and the status of the town as his chosen site. Origins of the deity image Vishnupur's astadhatu (alloy of eight metals in ritually prescribed proportions) image of Madan Mohan, according to some of the town's oral and written narratives, was acquired after Madan Mohan visited the raja in a dream. He requested to be rescued from the home of a brahmana who lived in the neighboring Birbhum area.8 In the dream, Madan Mohan explained how the impoverished brahmana was unable to keep and honor him satisfactorily. The king then stole the image from the house of the brahmana, draped it in his shawl and smuggled it back to Vishnupur buried in his clothes. However, the devastated brahmana traced the theft, also with the assistance of the deity through dream visitations, and arrived at the king's palace. Here, under cover of darkness, he approached Madan Mohan, now installed in the royal apartments and asked what sin he had committed and why he had been abandoned. When 8. It is uncertain which king is referred to in this narrative, but when pressed several residents suggested it might have been Raja Vir Hambir, the first historical ruler of the Malla dynasty. Recently reconstructed Malla family trees and oral tradition locate Vir Hambir at the end of a long line of rulers, but there is little historical evidence to corroborate this hoary lineage. The precise dates of Vir Hambir's reign and conversion remain uncertain and contested among historians. Most agree that he ruled from around the last decade of the sixteenth to the second decade of the seventeenth century. The only contemporary source to mention his name is Abul Fazl's Akbarnama. See Chakravarti, R. (1985:222-228), Saha (1995:24-28).</page><page sequence="8">Ghosh: Sojourns of a peripatetic deity 111 Madan Mohan explained how he needed to be here at this time and could not go back with him, the brahmana decided to stay in Vishnupur and serve as his priest. This narrative is highly revealing. It foreshadows later events in the life of Madan Mohan. Agency for movement of the image is given to the deity himself. It is through the medium of dreams that Madan Mohan specifically makes his intentions known. Significantly, Madan Mohan chooses to move because he is not maintained in suitable luxury even though the narrative turns it around, presenting the deity as understanding and compassionate, sparing the struggling brahmana the difficulty of having to provide for his earthly body. He moves to the protection of the king, who can support the sculpted image satisfactorily. The tale underscores the association of the deity with prosperity. Because it is divinely sanctioned and explained by the deity himself as alleviating his servant's strife, even the theft of the image, otherwise a heinous crime, is justified. This account also points to the assistance of brahmanas in establishing temple worship in an area where these ritual specialists were scarce. Mallabhum, the Land of the Mallas, appears to have been a densely forested area prior to the process of transformation initiated by the Malla rulers and the Vaishnava spiritual leaders at the end of the sixteenth century. In fact, Vishnupur is to this day surrounded by dense jungles of shala trees, infested by tigers, and called Vana-Vishnupur (that is, forested Vishnupur). Local lore suggests that the area was inhabited predominantly by a tribal population which was gradually introduced, to varying degrees, to urbanization and a mainstream Vaishnava lifestyle. The importation of brahmanas into this area to facilitate this process is well documented.9 Three kinds of brahmanas were resettled by the Malla rulers.10 By accepting royal land grants and settling in the Malla domains, these brahmanas honored the Raja and conferred upon the dynasty the status of true kings (kshatriya). It is likely that the narrative refers to this process in identifying the brahmana as a native of Birbhum. Thus Madan Mohan seems to have made provisions for his upkeep, in keeping with ritual prescription and keeping an eye open to the expenses the process incurred. Finally, the narrative draws attention to the deity's essentially peripatetic nature. Madan Mohan's wanderings have hallowed precedence within the Gaudiya Vaishnava devotional tradition to which the deity is affiliated. Chaitanya, the saint who founded the religious movement, was an itinerant figure who had forsaken worldly ties (sanyasin). His meanderings through the forests of Vrindavan, in north India, had uncovered the sites of Krishna's encounters with the cowherd i ng women of Mathura and culminated in the creation of a pilgrimage path through woods, bowers, and ponds on the banks of the Yamuna River.11 Perhaps by a happy coincidence, his travels also took him from the eastern periphery to the heart of the Mughal empire, its political clout and coffers, which were deployed dexterously toward establishing a sacred center at Vrindavan. Other famous Gaudiya deity images also have well-documented histories of travel that navigate toward shores of stability and success. For example, Govindadeva, the image discovered by the Gaudiya theologian Rupa Goswami in 1534, had departed from Vrindavan in 1669 for fear of the later Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's repressive policies against Hindu worship at the time. After six temporary residences through the Delhi-Ajmer region, he was permanently installed in Jaipur in western India as the lineage deity of the Kachwaha Rajputs, the most powerful Hindu dynasty in north India (see Entwistle 1986:185 and Nath 1996: 161-184). Similarly, contemporary literature describes the migration of other Vaishnava deities such as Sri Nathji, the central focus of the Pushtimargi community's worship, with all of its negotiations to power at Nathdwara (see Entwistle 1987:184). Closer to Vishnupur in the east, Lord Jagannath of Puri had moved to the southern Orissan hinterlands, seeking refuge during the struggles between the local Hindu rajas and the Afghan governors and the Mughal emperors (see Kulke 139-155, 321-342).12 9.

For a general discussion of importation of brahmanas into Bengal see Inden (1976). 10. Radhi brahmanas migrated from other parts of the Radh (a hilly terrain composed of red lat?rite soil stretching through parts of modern Bankura, Birbum, and Burdwan districts) and relocated to Vishnupur and its northeastern areas. Utkala brahmanas (from Orissa) settled in the areas of modern Taldangra, Raipur, and Ranibandh, and Madhyasreni brahmanas in the southern areas of modern Midnapore district. Of these the Radhi brahmanas were valued most highly for serving the temple deities, performing court rituals, and the royal family's life-cycle celebrations (Banerjee 1968:174-175). 11. For descriptions of Chaitanya's wanderings through the forests of Vrindavan see Dimock (1999), Haberman (1994). 12. One of the fascinating aspects of the complex power struggles surrounding Jagannatha in the late sixteenth century is that "the initial fight of the Afghans against the Jagannatha cult turned in the events during 1735 when a new Muslim Subahdar, against the embittered resistance of the Khurda Raja, but with the obvious support of the</page><page sequence="9">112 RES 41 SPRING 2002 Portability of a less arduous kind is also predicated within the framework of established ritual activity. At Vishnupur, deities such as Madan Mohan move from the lower sanctum of temples to the upper pavilion during festival celebrations as I will describe later. Others move from their own temple compounds to that of the central deity. And some such as Radha Ramana (he who dallies with Radha), the family deity of Srinivas Acharya, the spiritual leader who brought Gaudiya Vaishnavism to Vishnupur, are mendicants. They have no permanent home, but rather, move from shrine to shrine, from the hospitality of one branch of the devotee family to that of another. Madan Mohan's travels can therefore be located within the imaginative scope of the religious tradition, established as it is in sacred oral and written literature and ritual practice. Such movement of the embodied deity is only possible because the typical ?mages worshiped in this region are small, from ten to twenty inches in size, and hence imminently portable. Metal images are also less fragile than stone ones. Consequently they can be transported safely wrapped in a shawl. This vital quality of portability of the deity image creates the potential for relocation of the image, along with its entourage of favorite ritualists and accoutrements, and hence the consecration of new sacred space whenever Madan Mohan declares his intention to move. The Madan Mohan temple Madan Mohan currently resides in a fairly large, elaborate, and finely executed edifice built by Durjan Singh, one of the later Malla rulers, in 1694-1695 (figs. 3, 7).13 Seated on the altar against the back (north) wall of the sanctum, Madan Mohan and his consort Radhika are framed by the exquisitely detailed terra cotta narrative plaques that adorn the main south fa?ade of the temple. Molded with the popular exploits of Krishna, these panels proclaim Madan Mohan's identity as Krishna (fig. 5). The panels on either side of the entrance describe his childhood, attended by his foster mother Yashoda and her companions, and the adolescent years of tending the cows at Vrindavan (gosthalila). Episodes of his miraculous feats include the uprooting of the * N$T T^ 6?At Figure 7. Madan Mohan Temple Groundplan. Drawing by the author. demon-infested trees (jamalarjuna) and the killing of his uncle Kamsa. The arched spandrel area depicts the confrontation of warriors on chariots flourishing arms in the final battle of the Mahabharata in which Krishna played a pivotal part.14 This scene reminds the devotee of Krishna's other roles as determiner of ethical order (dharma). The pillars supporting these arches are ringed with small, animated figures dancing with hands raised, singing, and playing drums and cymbals, thus depicting the activities that occur in the courtyard (fig. 3).15 From their vantage point in the altar, Madan Mohan and Radhika enjoy these activities when their devotees gather during the evening for arati (evening service). Directly across, on the other side of the courtyard, is the natmandir (hall for entertainment), a rectangular structure covered by a double-eaved roof that replicates in brick the appearance of Bengali huts of the dochala type. Here musicians gather every night to lead the performance of priests of Puri, forcibly brought back the image of Jagannatha from its hiding place in South Orissa and established the cult of Puri" (323). 13. The temple is a square structure, 12.2 meters in length, and 10.7 meters in height. It is likely that there was an earlier temple or that this lineage deity was worshiped in the royal palace prior to the construction of this temple. 14. Included here is the figure of Bhishma lying on his bed of arrows. 15. Chaitanya had encouraged these activities through his personal example. Of all the ritual activities, singing the name of Hari is believed to be one of the most potent, and itself capable of granting deliverance to the devotee.</page><page sequence="10">Ghosh: Sojourns of a peripatetic deity 113 samkirtana (community singing). They sit in two rows facing each other, thus aligned with the altar at the end of the shrine and within the deities' sightline. A second less elaborate entrance from the east wall of the temple leads down through the courtyard to the bhogamandapa (kitchen). This path is used by the priest to bring Madan Mohan his daily meals, which are prepared in the kitchen. The temple thus has two axes of worship?one aligned with the community's space, highlighting its expressive devotional bhakti worship, and a second with the kitchen, which maintains the body of god in keeping with long-standing Brahmanical practices of priestly service. By the time the Madan Mohan temple was built at the end of the seventeenth century, this south entrance, the bhakti axis, came to dominate, lavished as it was with sculptural attention. In keeping with the Ratna temple typology established over the course of the seventeenth century at Vishnupur, this monument is double-storeyed.16 A set of stairs in the southwest corner of the building leads up to the miniature shrine stacked above the sanctum. This pavilion takes the basic form of the local mosques of the Bengal Sultanate, and it is here that Madan Mohan ascends to view his dominions on festival days, and to signal to the other deities of the town to begin their festivities, taking their cue from him.17 The temple form thus accommodates portability of the divine image, and the rituals of locality formation around the deity. Consecration of a sacred center The narratives about the origin of the deity image underscore Madan Mohan's alliance with the raya, the construction of his temple, and the organization of priestly worship. In doing so, they point to the establishment of the dynasty and the formation of a Gaudiya Vaishnava community and sacred site. The establishment of his temple, and those of the town's other deities, together with landscaping the immediate surroundings of Vishnupur with sacred ponds and groves created the sacred topography that would sustain its reputation over time.18 The Rajas also landscaped gardens and planted flowers and fruit trees to create green groves on the banks of these ponds, and constructed pavilions around them as at the paradigmatic Vaishnava site, Vrindavan, where these features map Krishna's eternal realm. The site of Krishna's play is thus replicated at Vishnupur for Madan Mohan's pleasure. Such planning at Vishnupur seems part of a larger attempt to recreate, in a fairly general way, the geographical features marking the sites of Madan Mohan's activities as experienced by the local populace to create a pilgrimage path through forests, ponds, ghats, and temples as those established at Benares and Vrindavan. From the time of Madan Mohan's intervention, Vishnupur has remained a locus of cultural activity through the practice of expressive forms and establishment of institutions. The stories and songs of his miracles attracted attention to the town and drew master composers and musicians to establish residence there in the service of the deity. Part of the town's present claim to fame thus rests on the foundation of a musical school, and the emergence of local musical geniuses.19 16. For a discussion of the Ratna temple form see Ghosh (1999). The lower level consists of a central square sanctum wrapped by shallow porches on the south, east, and west sides. These porches are accessible through the triple-arched entrance supported by squat, segmented, and multifaceted pillars and pilasters that are characteristic of Bengal's architectural tradition. They were appropriated from mosque construction under Sultanate rule since the fifteenth century for temple construction in the seventeenth century. The arch spandrel is curved, echoing the pronounced curvature of the eave that imitates the distinctive profile of the thatch roof of the region's hut architecture. Also reminiscent of the spatial organization of these domestic compounds, the main temple and its accessory structures such as the basil planter are confined within a walled enclosure. A detailed discussion of the appropriation of features from these huts is available in Ghosh "Space" (forthcoming). 17. The upper pavilion is square, with arched apertures in each of its four walls. Covering this structure is a dome surmounted by the traditional finial elements of a Hindu temple, the ribbed myrobalan fruit {amalaka) and waterpot {kalasha). The basic plan, for example, is preserved by the Goaldi Masjid from 1519 at Sonargaon. Adaptations from vernacular hut architecture and its monumentalization in the established tradition of mosque construction patronized by the preceding dynasties of independent Sultans of Bengal suggest not only the resourcefulness of the artisans but also speak about the negotiated nature of Bengali identity in the seventeenth century. By turning to Sultanate architecture the patrons of these temples, local Hindu rajas such as the Mallas, sought legitimacy from this indigenous source of political authority, recently displaced by the absorption of the region under the Mughal umbrella. In this political context, when these local authorities, both Muslim and Hindu, were rebelling against newly imposed Mughal authority through armed rebellion and refusal to pay taxes, the allegiance with Sultanate architecture becomes comprehensible as a statement about regional autonomy. 18. A physical transformation of the land and mapping of the conventional physical markers of sacred Vaishnava sites such as Vrindavan onto the Malla capital accompanied the process of consecrating Vaishnava territory through temple construction. 19. The Gaudiya Vaishnava leader Srinivas is credited with the introduction of the Manoharshahi Gharana (school of music). Local singers and musicians perpetuated this style by leading public recitals in the temple courtyards during festival celebrations.</page><page sequence="11">114 RES 41 SPRING 2002 Simultaneously, makers of musical instruments, particularly drums and cymbals, gathered as the town's distinctive ritual practices provided employment. Pilgrims continue to visit, and to participate in the recounting of tales and singing of songs in these temple courtyards every evening. This process was initiated by the enthusiastic personal sponsorship of Gaudiya Vaishnava song and poetry by the first historical Malla ruler Vir Hambir. The Karnananda, a seventeenth-century Gaudiya Vaishnava text, describes Vir Hambir's keen interest and active participation in the dissemination and preservation of these compositions: The Raja recites the pada (lyric) dreaming, and on hearing it Rattadevi [his queen] was moved and burst into tears of ecstacy. At daybreak the raja looked delighted and at that moment the queen implored him to recite the padas to her again. She would die if the raja denied her the rare pleasure (cited in Saha 1995:185). Other artistic practices emerged concurrently to provide the ritual needs of the deity. Conchshell workers, for example, established workshops juxtaposing the temple. The chiselling of shell resounds to this day, giving the neighborhood the name of Shankharibajar (conchshell market) (fig. 8). Silk is woven in the temples' courtyards and in the homes of Tantipara (weaver's neighborhood) behind. Vishnupur silk not only clothes the gods, but gradually became famous for the embroidered baluchari sari that has returned to fashion these days. The town's major markets lie adjacent. Here metalworkers display ritual implements such as bells, oil lamps, incense burners, and camphor containers in their shop windows, and the sweetmakers their wares. The street is lined with baskets of floral garlands, basil leaves, and other perishables purchased every day for worship. Communities and neighborhoods thus aggregated concentrically around the temple. Madan Mohan moves to the metropolis In 1789 A. Hesilridge, the British Assistant on Deputation at Vishnupur wrote to the Collector of Birbhum: In the whole District there are four hundred and fifty three Hindoo temples. The principal one in the town of Bisshenpore formerly contained the idol of Mudun Mohun. The offerings which were made him, by pilgrims from the parts of Hindoostan, added to the resources of the Zeminder and greatly to the riches of the country. This idol is now in Calcutta, detained by a native merchant, but in capacity of what authority, I have never been able to ascertain. Should this idol to whose removal . . . Hindoos Figure 8.

District, and impress the inhabitants with the favorable ideas of the British Government.20 Several versions of Madan Mohan's movement to Calcutta circulate.21 Most agree that Raja Chaitanya Singh (1752/3-1804), an ardent devotee, spent his time in prayer at Madan Mohan's feet and giving away his money to brahmanas, thus neglecting affairs of state. When impoverished by the unsuccessful crops after the disastrous Maratha invasions, the misconduct of his minister Kamal Biswas and the British government's peshkar Darpanarayan Kar, the Raja pawned the Madan Mohan ?mage in an attempt to raise money for litigation.22 Some accounts attribute this plan to Madan Mohan himself, communicated to the Raja in a dream. 20. Letter from A. Hesilrige (Mitra 1955:43). 21. See O'Malley (1995:33); Bishnupurer Madanmohaner Adi Mahatmya, Rajendra Library, Calcutta, p. 10.

Proceedings of the Board of Revenue dated 23rd March, 1789, no 28, and communication from C. Davis, Collector of Burdwan to the Board of Revenue, dated 12th February, 1804 (Mitra 1955:102).</page><page sequence="12">Ghosh: Sojourns of a peripatetic deity 115 When Chaitanya Singh finally returned with the lakh of rupees to get Madan Mohan back from the Bengali merchant who had loaned him the money, Gokul Mitra of Bagh Bazar refused to part with Madan Mohan as he himself had become an equally passionate devotee. At the Raja's persistence, the merchant devised a scheme, hoping to trick him. He produced two identical images and asked the Raja to choose the real Madan Mohan.23 Here the versions recounted at Vishnupur diverge from the ones at Calcutta. According to the Vishnupur ones, the Raja was at this time informed by Madan Mohan in a dream that he would himself help identify the real image, much as he had originally come up with the plan to pawn himself in order to assist the Raja. A white fly would sit on its nose, and the left half of the figure would begin to sweat. With this assurance, the Raja was successfully able to regain Madan Mohan, return to Vishnupur with the image, and reinstate the deity in his temple. The priest at Calcutta, however, explained that once the Raja identified the true ?mage, the merchant's daughter Vishnupriya (Beloved of Vishnu), who attended the deity with equal attention as the king and the merchant, intervened. Hearing that the Raja had returned to take Madan Mohan back, she held on to the hand of the deity. She was then transformed into the golden-skinned sculpted form of Radha. The present priest Subrata Pujari explained that she was an incarnation of Radha come down in the form of the merchant's daughter to attend to her lord. Madan Mohan informed the Raja that he would remain here with his beloved. The Raja then took the duplicate back with him to Vishnupur, which he reinstated in the temple. So which is the real Madan Mohan (figs. 1, 9)? The Calcutta priest explained how, in his opinion, both are authentic because it was the will of Madan Mohan that orchestrated these strange events. He pointed out that the priests who have served the Bagh Bazar Madan Mohan image come from Vishnupur, from the same family that serves Vishnupur's Madan Mohan. Similarly, the worship of the two deities is coordinated so that the calendar for celebratory events set at Vishnupur follow at Calcutta. Therefore, while the deity was split into two images, both are today considered to be complete and authentic in ritual practice. Richard Davis's observation about temple hagiographies is appropriate for the biographies of their deities: Although they do not provide us with factual historical narratives, they are certainly the products of a historical Figure 9. Altar of the Madan Mohan Temple in Calcutta with ?mages of Madan Mohan, Radha, and attendants. Photograph by the author. moment. . . and they articulate the categories and concerns of their cultural world just as much as the epics of conquest and of resistance do theirs. The impetus to compose comprehensive biographies of important sites, I would argue, grows out of the experience of disruption, and much of the thematic complexion of these site biographies results from the attempt to overcome disjuncture and to assert an overarching stability (Davis 1999:138). The different versions would suggest that it is not possible to consider the one site as center and the other as periphery; rather, both temples compete for the sacredness of their deity. The provision of priests of the same lineage, and the synchronization of their ritual calendars on a daily and annual basis also points to their inextricable connection, but one as co-equal centers rather than a hierarchical relationship that the replication of one site at another would suggest. The accrual of miracles to the Bagh Bazar image discussed below validates the claims of the sacred center emerging in the heart of the colonial capital. Duplicating the divine body The creation of a duplicate image is predicated on the commodification of the object. The body of the divine is treated as a market commodity when it is given a price of a lakh of rupees, probably partly for its precious 23. Some versions suggest that there were three rather than two ?mages.</page><page sequence="13">116 RES 41 SPRING 2002 metal content and partly for its reputation as an alert and active deity (jagrata). Its renown and uniqueness not only boosted its investment value, but also paved the way for supplying demand through copying. The duplication of the image, so precise that its ardent followers and caretakers were unable to tell them apart, was technically possible because the original ?mage was made of metal. Because such sculpture is created by the lost wax method, an impression of the original can be obtained in soft wax. Around that reversed impression, a clay version can be built up. When an inner clay core is fixed to the clay mold, the whole can then be fired. Where the wax melts away liquid metal is typically introduced through flues to replace it to take the shape of the desired ?mage. Upon cooling, when the metal hardens, it can be freed from the clay armature. The technology of its making, by lost wax casting, thus allowed for a duplicate to be created. Similarly, close copies of Chola bronzes with the same hand gestures and attributes had become available because of the technology of their making.24 Had the original been a stone image, its replication without any visible changes would not have been possible.25 Several beliefs and practices allow for the divine body to be duplicated. The potency of the ?mage as an icon depended on following precise textual prescriptions for iconography and iconometry, that is, effectively, in producing a good copy. In fact, similitude (sadrishya) is one measure of a successful image in many of the texts discussing aesthetic (rasa) theory, as is one of the nuances of the term "image" in English. More generally, justification for such acts of duplication derives from the very term "murti," which is used to refer to these deity images.26 Although typically translated as a body into which the divine enters, in Bengali the term denotes the sign, character, or nature (akriti, shakar, chehara) more broadly.27 Such a broad Figure 10. Terra corta panel depicting the circular dance of Krishna with the gopis (milkmaids). Photograph by the author. definition would not exclude copies, that is duplicated images, from serving as suitable vehicles, of the same potency as the original. The circular form of the rasamandala or dance formation in which Krishna replicates himself to dance with each gopi to satisfy her passion would also point to a paradigm of potentially infinite duplication on the part of the divine (fig. 10). Unlike the earlier cases of replication referred to above, modern reproduction of Chola images with the intent of fraud or deception more often responds to a growing art market's interest in them.28 As Mark Jones argues "fakes . . . provide unrivalled evidence of the values and perceptions of those who made them, and of those for whom they were made." He goes on to suggest that mistakes by connoisseurs are made not because of a scarcity of knowledge and experience, but rather because "perception itself is determined by the structure of expectations that underpins it" (Jones 1990:11-12). In the case of the Madan Mohan images that structure of expectations on the part of their communities of worship, led by the king and the merchant, seems to have validated both. The narrative of duplication of the Madan Mohan image poses questions about authenticity of the image and of course challenges the viewer's response. Gokul Mitra's act of creating a duplicate is partly a test of the king's devotion, and a comparison against his own. The 24. See Linda (1988:59-61) for a discussion of re?ut Chola pieces and the values attached to such acts. 25. For discussions of stone images of striking similarity see the essays by Forrest McGill and Joanna G. Williams. Addressing two works from the same period and region, McGill interprets one as a masterpiece and the other as a competent piece; while comparing a modern copy with a Gupta head, Williams challenges prevalent values and criteria for connoisseurship. McGill (1988:13-15), Williams (33-36). 26. On the term murti see Eck (1996) and Williams (1986:90 105). The divine body could range from an anthropomorphic to abstract sculpted form, or to found images, depending on where the divine chose to manifest. See also Cutler and Waghorne (1985). 27. Bengali dictionary definition in Chalantika Adhunik Bangabhashar Abhidhan (1385 BS). 28. Forgery has been defined variously over time. To cite one approach, Nelson Goodman has observed: "A forgery of a work of art is an object falsely purporting to have the history of production requisite for the (or an) original of the work" (1976:122).</page><page sequence="14">Ghosh: Sojourns of a peripatetic deity 117 narrative can, in part, be read in terms of an act of forgery. If the merchant stands in for the figure of the maker or commissioner of a fraudulent version of the image, the king fills the role of a modern connoisseur or curator. The narrative itself encourages such interpretation through use of the term "Nakal (copy, fake) Madan Mohan," often put in the deity's mouth in both written and oral versions. The analogy, however, cannot be pushed too far. Whether the merchant's intent was to deceive is less than clear since he appears to have posed it as a challenge to the king. And the question of an original or standard, upon which identity of the fake is dependent, or vice versa, remains. While the use of the term "Nakal Madan Mohan" would suggest an inauthentic copy that was not embodied by the deity, the belief structure that informs the embodiment of divinity, that the divine chooses to inhabit sculpted forms, suggests that if consecrated, the notion of an original or authentic is of no consequence. In other words, copies can function as the original for the devotional community, even if, in their form, such images are a kind of simulacrum as Baudrillard puts it, "never again exchanging for what is real, but exchanging in itself, in an uninterrupted circuit without reference or circumference" (Baudrillard 1983:141). While for an art market such works are a threat because they "loosen our hold on reality, deform and falsify our understanding of the past" by implicit reference to the tenuousness of any notion of the real, for the priests and devotees of Madan Mohan, such simulacra did not pose that particular anxiety (Baudrillard 1983:142). To take the point one step further then, as vehicle of the formless divine (nishkala), the sculpted artifact is always an image (vision), and hence a simulation of sorts.29 The narrative frames the challenge as an act of connoisseurship, through careful looking, as well as one of devotion. As collectors and curators have examined replicas and copies through a variety of tests, so also tests were applied to sacred ?mages. Richard Davis, for example, has recounted the tale of authenticating the Sriranganatha ?mage of Sri Rangam when retracted after it was lost. Only after an old temple washerman, who used to drink the water from washing the deity's clothes, corroborated that the water from the new deity's bathwater tasted the same, was that image reinstated (Davis 1999:137). In the case of Madan Mohan, the deity himself appears to have provided the initial criteria for authentication, which the community accepted probably because of the miraculous nature of the test, since sculpted metal does not perspire and white flies are not a scientifically verifiable species. Another version of this narrative suggests that there were further tests of authentication. One telling elaborates that when the raja returned to Vishnupur with Madan Mohan, his queen, not satisfied, provided the deity with golden bowls filled with yoghurt. Madan Mohan came and sat on her lap and devoured all of it in minutes. She then asked him to call her mother, and when he did so, she took the image to the temple, installed it at the altar, and ordered the commencement of festivities for the celebration of the Rash festival (Oral communication, Mrs. Chittaranjan Dasgupta). Miracles and the power of devotion, therefore, lie at the heart of these processes of re-authentication, as they had lain in the original attraction of his devotees to the image of Madan Mohan, whether at Vishnupur or at Calcutta. Finally, the priests affirmed a duplicate through ritual worship. If fakes "are, before all else, a response to demand, an ever changing portrait of human desires," it would appear that the needs of the local population at Vishnupur, such as the alleviation of calamities and pilgrimage income, as mentioned by Hesilrege, would have motivated the restoration of the temple deity (Jones 1990:12). It would appear that Bagh Bazar in north Calcutta, the area settled newly by the growing Bengali mercantile community that prospered from the English trade, would have benefited from the consecration of sacred space. It is the collaboration of the priests with the king and then with the merchant in coming to Calcutta to serve his deity that accommodated and legitimated this process of duplication. While the narrative, in part, suggests continuities to smooth over disruptions, it also incorporates an emergent site of devotion within the deity's itinerary and oral travelogue, thereby legitimating it. Madanmohantala: urbanizing Madan Mohan, making Calcutta Bengali How is a sacred center of the sort established earlier at Vishnupur created in the eighteenth-century commercial center of Calcutta? How is Madan Mohan localized in this British colonial port city? When Madan Mohan took his place in the merchant's household, he was given his own quarters (fig. 11). In the marble front reception area, he sat on a silk-lined silver shrine, where he received darshan from beyond the cusped, pointed, triple arches on Shah Jahani baluster columns that separated visitors from the sanctum, where priests 29. On images as visualizations of schemata, see Gombrich (2000), Bryson(1986).</page><page sequence="15">118 RES 41 SPRING 2002 Figure 11. Madan Mohan Temple, Baghbazar, Calcutta. Photograph by the author. tended to his needs. He also had an attached dining room and bedroom with bathing and dressing areas (figs. 12, 13). All these functions and spaces had previously been collapsed into the sanctum of his temple at Vishnupur. He was thus lavished greater luxury than had been indulged by the Rajas of Vishnupur, particularly as they were impoverished in the mid eighteenth century by their managers, by the rise of competing zamindaris such as Burdwan, and by the lack of support from the British in Calcutta.30 The narratives that circulate in north Calcutta, where the grand mansions of the Tagores at Jorasanko, the Deb family at Shobhabazar, the Mallik family at Pathuriaghata and Chorbagan, and the Mitras of Baghbazar and Kumartuli were constructed during the second half of the eighteenth century, are equally telling of Madan Mohan's settling into Calcutta's urban elite life.31 Mohanlal Mitra, a seventh-generation survivor of the merchant Gokul Mitra, who took Madan Mohan in and housed him in his palace at Bagh Bazar, recounted the tale of Madan Mohan's theft of spinach (pui shak) (figs. 14, 15) (Personal communication, Calcutta, June 2000). When installed in his new home, Madan Mohan discerned that he was being discriminated against. While he was offered exotic flowers, expensive fruit, and sweetmeats, Gokul Mitra and his family ate more mundane fare that he in fact craved. One afternoon, unable to resist temptation, Madan Mohan crept down the back stairs to the kitchen where he lifted the cover of the pot and ate all the spinach curry remaining from the afternoon meal. While carrying some of it back to his bedroom, where he was supposed to have been taking his afternoon nap, he left trails of spinach up the stairs and to the thakur ghar (deity's home). Thus it was discovered that Madan Mohan preferred to partake of the family's daily meal over the fancy fare, the exotic treats and delicacies provided for him. Such tales suggest how the deity endeared himself to Gokul Mitra's family, becoming one of them, as he had become the Raja's son at Vishnupur. They point to the expressive devotional (bhakti) nature of the Gaudiya Vaishnava movement, initiated in the sixteenth century. The founder Chaitanya himself was gradually revealed during his lifetime to be the divine incarnation, the embodiment of the deity, the closest imaginable 30.

According to Gaudiya belief, Krishna had come down (avatarana) to taste the offerings of love.32 In keeping with bhakti reversals of orthodox theology and practice, Madan Mohan, satisfied with his devotee (bhakta), shared, even helped himself to his meal. A recounting of the tobacco incident first alerted me to this corpus of narratives (Personal communication, Reba Basu, Vishnupur, May 2000). One evening when Gokul Mitra settled down with his hookah, he realized it was empty, and called for his servant Madna (a familiar form of Madan). And once it was refilled, he proceeded to imbibe. Madna, however, returned from the bazaar and said he had done no such thing. What is implicit is that Madan Mohan, who shared that name, had performed another minor miracle. Again, the tale points to how the deity tied himself inextricably to his new patron through bonds of affection and sheer presence. And again, it is the divine who served his servant. The choice of tobacco, and in this case fine Vishnupuri tobacco (from Vishnupur) suggests another point of contact between the two sites?not only the deity came from Vishnupur, but also the tobacco with which he filled in the merchant's hookah. Finally, the selection of tobacco as expression of affection indexes changes in the social and cultural environment where the divine manifests. From the choice of dairy products associated with Krishna in Mathura, a highly successful cowherding area in early medieval times, and cannon-fire against Maratha raiders in Vishnupur, Madan Mohan prepared tobacco (tamak shaja) in the British city of Calcutta. European traders appropriated that activity as they gradually took on the Nawabs' role as reigning elite. It was also a leisure activity they shared with the elite Indians who participated in the European trade as middlemen. Elaborately fashioned silver hookahs with carved, enamelled, or bidriware bodies survive in the family collections of these Bengali babus. Hookah smoking is one of the most popular subjects of Company painting, a genre of depictions of ritualized activity in colonial India commissioned by European administrators and cultural figureheads and painted by local artists seeking patronage after having been severed from the disempowered Bengal Nawabs who had been their traditional benefactors.33 Kalighat paintings, a genre that emerged simultaneously as pilgrimage and tourist souvenirs, parody the activity when placing it in the mouths of the prostitutes of the city's burgeoning redlight district. Together the tales also point to the mechanisms by which the British port city became habitable for the Hindu Bengali population that had been attracted to it for the commercial opportunities offered. The arrival of Madan Mohan, an urbane and well-respected deity of the earlier regime, that is the Mughal reign with its structure of Hindu zamindars such as the Vishnupur For the Mallik family of Rathuriaghata and other gold merchants {subarnabanik) see Bhattacharya (1896), Laha, Subarnabanik Katha or Kirti, vols 1-3; and Risley 1891. 32.

Mallas, into the colonial world as that older system of authority collapsed, signifies the relocation of regional authority to Calcutta and renegotiation of cultural weight among the city's burgeoning Bengali bourgeoisie. Madan Mohan's association with prosperity and auspiciousness now transferred to mercantile profits from the previous period of land-based wealth. That transition is evoked in the figures of the king who is bankrupt and has to pawn his most prized possession, and the merchant who welcomes the divine into his household.34 Conversely, eighteenth-century Calcutta was described as the abode of the new gods of a new regime: During the conflict of the English with the Nawabs of Bengal, Calcutta was churned up, and from this churning deadly poison as well as delightful ambrosia issued forth, and this has made Calcutta unparalleled and famous throughout the world . . . The Goddess of Wealth is ever present and at her sight the God Narayana has also decided to be here as the idol of the city, bringing with him his impetuous horses causing lively movement and justifying the definition of the city as the Abode of the Goddess of Wealth.35 Madan Mohan's arrival into the home of one of the earliest and most successful of the eighteenth-century merchants points to the emerging demand for religious ritual amidst the emerging "Babu" culture. Like the Hindu temples in Pittsburgh, New York, or Houston of the late twentieth century, they articulate the need to sanctify the land in terms familiar to new immigrants.36 Many merchant families attributed their commercial success to the presence of the traditional deities who had supported the landowning classes previously. Lavish gifts of jewelry to the deity, or public meals were given in gratitude for particular requests granted. Even the East India Company performed a thanksgiving puja in 1765 upon obtaining the Diwani of Bengal, spending exorbitant sums, somewhere between Rs 5000 and Rs 30,000 (Dutta 1990:25). The Madan Mohan Temple's 34. While the sociopolitical context of this particular narrative locates it in the colonial period, these figure-types are by no means new.

Along with lavish daily worship in the thakur dalans (temples enclosed within the domestic compound), festivals from Krishna's biography such as Janmasthami, Rash, Jhulan, and Ratha Yatra, were celebrated with much pomp and entertainment in the adjacent natmandirs (halls for entertainment). Mohanlal Mitra pointed out the enormous courtyard overlooking Madan Mohan's temple at Baghbazar, and described how during Annakut (giving of rice) the ground was piled high with rice that would later be distributed among the city's poor. Madan Mohan was taken out on boat rides on the River Hughly across from Baghbazar, where he enjoyed displays of fireworks. The entertainment sponsored at these occasions employed a variety of traditional artists. Scroll painter minstrels (patuas) were invited to sing stories of the beloved gods and goddesses to their scrolls at such celebrations. Famous poets engaged in verbal contests (kobir ladai) in the courtyards of these mansions. Jatradals (rural theater companies) also came at the behest of these urban rajas and performed popular narratives. Gradually these artists and the supporting artisans such as wig-makers, costume designers, and musicians settled in the Chitpur area of north Calcutta.37 The relocation of Madan Mohan, one of the older and more established of the gods of the Bengali countryside, to the hub of cosmopolitan prosperity thereby helped stimulate urban settlement and development of the city as it had at Vishnupur previously. It not only sanctified a colonial trading town, but also made it Bengali by contributing to the formation of a "cosmopolitan folk culture, sometimes little modified from its village counterpart and sometimes assimilated to the mass culture of the urban center," as anthropologist Milton Singer has termed it (Singer 1991:35). These continuities between urban and rural forms of expression sustained traditional Bengali culture in the British capital. As Singer notes: Perhaps the most striking aspect of the continuity in culture between village and city is the common stock of mythological and legendary themes shared by both villager and city man. The same stories from the R?m?yana, the Bh?gavatapur?na, and the Mah?bh?rata are recited, sung, and played in both village and city (Singer 1991:35).38 By providing an avenue for the conspicuous consumption that marked this new culture, festival celebrations stimulated friendly rivalries and distinctive traditions in the performances sponsored at the mansions of north Calcutta.39 These rituals, in turn, contributed to the consolidation of the new aristocracy. A generation later, in 1823, Raja Radhakanta Deb of the Shobhabazar family, for example, prepared a list of the new twenty-three "Respected and Opulent Natives of the 'Presidency' [of Bengal]."40 The flamboyance associated with the appropriation of older, established, and powerful deities by the elite families thus contributed to the creation of the new Bengali area of north Calcutta, the first Black Town, and regular performance of ritual worship ensured its maintenance and expansion. Relevant in discussing this phenomenon is Arjun Appadurai's formulation that "locality as a dimension of social life, and as an articulated value of particular neighborhoods, is not a transcendent standard from which particular societies fall or deviate. Rather, locality is always emergent from the practices of local subjects in specific neighborhoods" (1996:198). He distinguishes between locality as "primarily relational and contextual rather than as scalar or spatial" and neighborhoods as "the actually existing social forms in which locality, as a dimension or value, is variably realized." In his terms, the feeling of locality can be mapped spatially as a bounded neighborhood, in part, by the activities embraced by these families to honor their gods. Because it is inherently tenuous, locality is often bounded and renewed ritually. Such repetitive acts maintain the materiality of Madanmohantala in Baghbazar as a neighborhood, partly in relation, or even opposition, to other larger locality-producing social formations such as that of the English at Fort William, which, in turn, it helped define. As Appadurai has phrased it: "Such neighborhoods are imagined, produced, and maintained against some sort of ground 37.

Sandalwood and ash on the forehead, along with the ingestion of holy water and food, physically inscribe group identity (Appadurai 1996:179). These processes of locality formation through ritual activity alternate with the nonlocal aspects of the deity's agenda, his travels from site to site in search of patrons and prosperity, temples and devotees. The narratives discussed here would suggest that Madan Mohan's sojourns, and the social activities of his caretakers, become the basis for the creation of new devotional communities, for the production of new neighborhoods. This dialectic of local and translocal, most recently global, processes generated by the deity's travel and stasis, are predicated upon his embodiment. Expressive devotional (bhakti) traditions often encourage imagining the earthly body of god as one way of making the divine accessible. That physical body is understood variously by the many Vaishnava communities. According to the Vishnu Purana, "Verily, this whole [world] is the body of God" (Vishnu Purana 1.12.38, cited by Nelson (1998:1). Conversely, the deity is visualized anthropomorphical ly as Vishvarupa (the Form of the World), as a male figure with infinite heads and arms in sculpture from the sixth century onward. The land is perceived as holy, a network of pilgrimage routes linking sites associated with deities, which are often sites of natural significance endowed with sacredness by conflation with divine biographies or saints' lives. Tirthas emerged following the trail of Krishna's life and travels from Vrindavan to Dwaraka, Chaitanya's from Navadwip to Vrindavan and 41. Such locality building around the newly arrived deity has its own colonial dimensions as well. The Bengali elite, with the support of the brahman priests, asserted ritual ly and socially organized power over what might have appeared to be potentially chaotic development of the port city from their point of view. It is perhaps more transparent in the case of Vishnupur, where the local kings' collaboration with the spiritual leaders of the devotional movement propagated sacred space, which coincided with their territorial extent. Puri, and Srinivas' from Vrindavan to Vishnupur (Eck 1981 ). Vaishnava texts wax eloquent about the radiance of the Vrindavan/Braj landscape where fruits and flowers glisten like gemstones, blessed by the divine contact. This earthly realm, as the site of his lilas, is identical with Vaikuntha, Krishna's divine abode. Such an understanding of divine presence simultaneously affirms the belief that divinity also inheres in specific places, and that Madan Mohan never abandoned Vishnupur, despite some versions of the narrative of his later travels.
