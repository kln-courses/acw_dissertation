JONES On posthumous art Art history is addicted to the thrill of posthumous revelations. Along with the sensational stories of Andrew Wyeth's hidden paintings of his mistress Helga, the questionable exposure of Jackson Pollock's Jungian "analysis drawings" by his doctor, and the cosmic joke Marcel Duchamp played on scholars with his top-secret ?tant donn?s, we art historians can think of a thousand other traps laid by modern artists for their interpreters. Messages coded into paintings, sculptures made after "giving up art for chess," memoirs sealed for seventy five years, external source material incinerated or perhaps just buried in voluminous file folders?the modern artistic persona is often (as Jasper Johns noted famously) either "watchman" or "spy." Information is hoarded by the artist as a means of power and control, but interestingly enough, little may be destroyed. Are these secrets meant for oblivion, or merely planted for deferred discovery? Are they not, in fact, enticements and seductions?more like what literary theorist Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick calls the "closet in view," visible occlusions needed to activate the dynamic of interpretation itself?1 Ambiguity and hidden-ness, in this view, may not only be qualities inherent in a given image. They may be aspects of an explicit artistic strategy. Such a strategy betrays modern (and postmodern) artists' consciousness of the role played by (art) history and artworld institutions in determining long-term success?the artwork aims not only at a buyer, but at the hermeneutic apparatus attending the historical record.2 Modern artists contemplate a career bifurcated into unequal halves: the relatively short conscious life available to them for productive activity, and, if they are successful, the much longer posthumous existence of their art (an existence celebrated in the hoary adage Ars longa, vita brevis). The art historian, encountering this after-life with her apparatus of photographic documents, gallery records, interviews, letters, and aging ephemera, parries every artist's secret with a thrust of interpretive curiosity. Neither artist nor interpreter can live without the other.3 The hidden and the ambiguous are terms made meaningful in art by interpreters of artists' productions. The secretive artist, and the prying historian, engage in a highly ritualized form of contact, like a martial arts tournament or a slightly violent form of dance. This dance is made all the more compelling to the art historian when the artist (and fantasized partner) is a figure whose place in history seems most secure or most univalent, and when the corresponding secret promises the maximum disruption of the "body of work." Then the oscillation between public persona and some hidden self sets up its most enticing rhythm, and the historian's feet begin irresistibly to tap in response. And so it is with my prefatory examples: Wyeth, that paragon of austere, puritanical Americana, is shown to have had a torrid affair with his flaxen-haired German model (to great strategic effect in the market for his Some of the arguments in this essay have been published in other venues, most notably, in the Smithson chapter of my book Machine in the Studio: Constructing the Postwar American Artist (Chicago, 1996). Extensions into gender theory and landscape have been pursued in "Robert Smithson's Technological Sublime: Alterities and the 'Female Earth'," in Anna Gruetzner Robins and Steven Adams, eds., Gendering Landscape Art (University of Manchester Press, 2001 ). A chunk of the early analysis of "preconscious" Smithson was published in Memory and Oblivion: Proceedings of The XXIXth International Congress of the History of Art (Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Press, 1999). I am grateful to Dario Gamboni and the two anonymous reviewers for Res, who encouraged me to press the case further, and to begin thinking about the "posthumous" author-function?surely the most significant, yet undertheorized, phase of any artist's career. I also want to thank Elyse Goldberg, manager of the Smithson Estate, for her crucial assistance with research and illustrations for the present essay, and Robert Haywood for useful comments; heartfelt appreciation is also here tendered to the NEH and Guggenheim Foundations, and the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin, for the time and space to write it. 1.

Initially, these could emerge only within the frame left by the artist in his struggle to secure himself as "contemporary;" ultimately, however, the posthumous author-function has assumed its own unstable dynamic. This essay attempts to map the terrain between the two. Since his untimely death in 1973, Smithson's reputation has only grown in importance, based on a large group of influential writings (collected and published immediately after his death and recently reissued in an expanded edition), a smattering of quirky minimalist sculptures, a strong body of conceptually based installations, and a few monumental earthworks such as Spiral Jetty and Broken Circle/Spiral Hill (figs. 1 and 2). Within the last fifteen years, however, early work that the artist himself bracketed off as "preconscious" has been trickling out of the estate; these ?mages have been joined in the artworld by posthumous prints of photographs that the artist himself neither reproduced nor exhibited. These polarities of an expanded artistic identity (preconscious and posthumous) are examined here in an effort to understand how postmodernism's salutary critique of the author may have opened the door to a magnificent proliferation of author-functions and author-effects. Reviewing both preconscious and posthumous phases of Smithson's career, I argue that we can identify at least two Smithsons. Moreover, I conclude that we can use one of these (the critical postmodernist), to dismantle the market-driven effects of the other (the "collector's" Smithson). The distinction between a hidden identity and an ambiguous (but clearly posthumous) one will be drawn. First, the preconscious Smithson, which re-emerged only in the post-mortem phase. 4. Here, readings by Amelia Jones are my model. See her Postmodernism and the (En)Gendering of Marcel Duchamp (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993).

Hidden Smithson Smithson entered art history forcefully in 1965, with the simultaneous appearance of his first published essays and his first abstract geometric sculptures, out of which signature works such as Gyrostasis develop (fig. 3). Reconstructing Smithson's career before this period was once very difficult, primarily because of the artist's own decision to begin his official history with the date of 1964. Although he had been showing and selling his art since 1959, it was only in 1964, he later claimed, that he "began to function as a conscious artist. . . ."5 In interviews held after this self-imposed moment of origin, he insisted that those early years had been ones of private struggle, of getting things "out of my system" and of getting "rid of that problem!, overcoming a] lurking pagan religious anthropomorphism."6 Repudiating "pagan anthropomorphism" had as much to do with rejecting his own earlier interest in a full 5.

Further evidence for this conscious/preconscious split is Smithson's decision to destroy earlier work or negotiate for its return from collectors who had acquired it, continued by Nancy Holt (as Smithson's widow and executor) who retains certain works as entirely "personal" in nature.

Like Frank Stella, Andy Warhol, and a surprising number of highly successful artists in his generation, Smithson may have turned toward a nonobjective style in part to dilute the force of his own religious upbringing. (Warhol found his exit from ethnicity in mass culture, Stella in cool minimalist icons.) Certainly the intensity of religious feeling engaged him very much during the preconscious period he later closed off. This earlier Smithson wrote poetry based on Dante's inferno, imagined Hell as a site of actual geological compression, drew pictures of a suffering Christ mocked by commodities, and seemed in general to have fully engaged with the force of Catholicism's "paganistic" iconophilia.7 He described himself to a later interviewer as one who resisted this force (but acknowledged that it nonetheless "haunted" him): I was very skeptical even through high school . . . they thought I was a Communist and an atheist, which I was actually. That problem always seemed to come up. ... I guess I was always interested in origins and primordial beginnings, ... I guess this was always haunting me all the way until about 1959 and 1960 when I got interested in Catholicism through T.S. Eliot and . . . T.E. Hulme. . . . [Emphasis added]8 That period in which he "got interested in Catholicism" (as opposed to his years at home when it was, perhaps, "imposed" on him) found him attempting to connect its "haunting" imagery to larger structures, most crucially, a modern American art (whose hero, Jackson Pollock, had already been described by Clement Greenberg as manifesting certain "Gothic" tendencies).9 Abstraction, in this view, would encode for the rituals of incarnation what "pagan" anthropomorphism would need m i metical ly to represent. As Smithson wrote in one unpublished essay drafted during the "closed" period: The rituals that Pollock discovered in Hopi religion and Navaho sand painting exist also in the outskirts of New York City. Penitential fires are built on Halloween in the dim regions of the suburbs, burning inside the rotting Jack o'Lantern with glowing hollow eyes, nose, and mouth. . . . Is this the face of American art? A face that risks Gothic dread on a million crabgrass-ridden lawns.10 This Smithson worked through the incarnatory thematics of Catholicism in a powerful way, relating them to the embodied rhetoric of "action painting:" "Jackson Pollock and other American 'action' painters have restored something of the ritual life of art. Action painting . . . reveals unformed incarnations from a primordial animism lurking in sacramental substance." Commenting on the smugness of American Protestants in the face of such "catholic" excess, he muses: "This kind of sly moral ism is at the heart of much American art both 'abstract' and 'realistic'There's nothing more invincible than an American Protestant in Rome."11 Of course, it was not just Protestants who produced the moral and aesthetic criteria that valued abstraction above representation in mid-century America. Clement Greenberg had played perhaps the largest role in ensuring that "pragmatism and positivism" would be used in judging contemporary art, the best of which was confirmed to be that urban industrialist grid undergirding Cubist abstraction?inimical to "pagan anthropomorphism" and all that implied.12 For the public, Smithson's emergence as an abstract artist completely effaced his religious past. But after his death, interesting characterizations emerged: "Catholic 7. Smithson's poem, "From the Walls of Dis," is exemplary: "Crushed under infernal/ Rocks./ Crushed under infernal/ Rocks./ . . . Walls throb/With Death;/ . . . Shrieks pierce the bowels/ Of the Damned./ Howl!/ ... In the grave/ . . . Lost./ Lost./ Lost./ Amen." See Tsai, Smithson Unearthed, n. 59, pp. 54, 55. Catholicism is not the only echo here, of course; think of Allan Ginsberg's "Howl" and "Kaddish." SeeTsai's volume for related drawings from the period such as Creeping Jesus, 1962 (Tsai plate 3). By this later date Smithson is finding the distance he sought from religious themes and their "pagan anthropomorphism." Here, the crucified Christ (with atypically crossed arms held over his head) looks baleful, surrounded by a collage of advertisements featuring cherries, a car, a fragmentary injunction to "..quip your c... and get 36%," and photos of costumed queens holding kitchen appliances. A fragment showing a hand ringing a bell seems to suggest that the time is at hand, but Smithson's sardonic title immediately mocks his collage's serious tone. 8. Ibid. (Tsai), p. 148. 9. "Significantly and peculiarly, the most powerful painter in contemporary America and the only one who promises to be a major one is a Gothic, morbid and extreme disciple of Picasso's cubism and Miro's post-cubism, tinctured also with Kandinsky and Surrealist inspiration. His name is Jackson Pollock, . . . Faulkner and Melville can be called in as witnesses to the nativeness of such violence, exasperation and stridency."

That story has been detailed elsewhere; here our interest lies with how the art objects from that period became revealed, and what they can be taken to mean for the author-function.14 Until quite recently, Smithson's account of an absolute breakthrough in 1964-65 governed all interpretations of his work. But as the market for figurative and expressionist modes of painting grew in the 1980s, along with interest in Smithson as an early postmodernist, a "hidden" Smithson appeared. The earlier, largely figurative work began to emerge into the gallery system, and a certain "buzz" began to build. This culminated in the artist Peter Halley's 1985 essay for an exhibition at Diane Brown Gallery, and art historian Eugenie Tsai's 1991 book and installation of the early paintings and drawings.15 Now, through the comparison of archival photographs and contemporaneous reviews of early exhibitions with Smithson's own recently released unpublished essays, archival papers, and pre 1964 assemblages, the earlier, preconscious Smithson has begun to be described. Perforce, it too is a posthumous Smithson. Rather than undercutting or endangering our view of Smithson's most famous earthworks, the tumultuous past that can now be constructed makes the "conscious" productions seem even more powerfully complex?an effect that echoes the impact of Duchamp's Etant donn?s, but is absent from the sensation of Wyeth's late nudes or the further information provided by Pollock's Jungian themes. The difference, I would submit, is that both Duchamp and Smithson are major figures in postmodern theory. As such, the seeming contradictions provided by Duchamp's splayed nude or Smithson's religiously or sexually charged early works play into the poly vocal ity and slippage we impute to postmodernism itself. The present essay will concur, in arguing that the more complex view of Smithson emerging from the preconscious works better fits what we know of his dialectical practice, linking the early paintings, drawings, and collages with his earthworks and rendering them as deconstructive, desublimating discourses that powerfully critique the late-twentieth century infatuation with the technological sublime. What then, were the objects produced in this half decade of professional artmaking that Smithson attempted to bracket off as "preconscious"? In letters written at the time, Smithson describes the paintings that would constitute his first one-man show as "Posters from Hell . . . how glorious?if you know what I mean. . . ."16 The works themselves have been lost or destroyed, but there are images of a few, and still others are referenced by title in the 1959 Artists' Gallery exhibition that made the nineteen-year-old Smithson feel he could "keep on going" as an artist. This early one-person show seems to have contained sixteen works whose titles suggest romantic places (Equator, The Ruins, Walls of Dis, Coronado's Journey), natural scientific marvels (Living Extinction, Flesh Eater [fig. 4], Spider Lady, Shark Man, White Dinosaur, Blue Dinosaur), and liminal states (Portrait of a Lunatic, Portrait of a Transvestite, The Victim, The Absence, The Assassin).u As mentioned above, the "Hell" of these works seems both an eschatological category and a particular geological 13.

From these poems and related paintings (whose motifs ranged from paleolithic to Dantesque), Smithson turned to imagery that dealt explicitly with Catholic liturgy, such as Jesus Mocked or Feet of Christirom 1961.18 Far from considering these images to be purely personal or mere juvenalia, as he would later aver, Smithson showed them in several Manhattan galleries soon after they were finished, sold them when there was interest, and chose them in 1961 for that fateful first international exhibition at the Galleria George Lester in Rome. At around the same time he produced these more finished painterly works on paper and canvas that he showed in Rome, Smithson completed several suites of pencil or pen and ink drawings that seem to have been more private (although even a few of these were sold).19 The only one of these thematic suites that appears to be complete is the extraordinary set of sixteen sheets Smithson titled Hitler's Opera. The order of the drawings in Hitler's Opera is unclear, nor do we know what function they were intended to serve. The apparent frontispiece sets the tone: the letters that form the title are made of serpents, monsters, and twining growths, little grotesqueries such as those found in the corners of Renaissance pattern books.20 In between the words "Hitler's" and "Opera" appears a multiply horned beast whose flayed-looking muscles strain with effort as it gives birth to (or excretes) a serpentine figure of Hitler. In another sheet from this remarkable suite, Hitler appears to be fecundating a 18. Jesus Mocked and Feet of Christ are both illustrated in Tsai (see note 5), plates 1 and 2. 19. Tsai (see note 5) writes: "A collector named John Streep purchased a number of suites from this period. He encountered Smithson by chance in 1973 and made a deal with the artist to exchange the early suites for examples of Smithson's more recent work. According to Nancy Holt, Smithson was relieved the trade was to occur, as he did not want the early drawings 'out in the world.' Before the trade could take place, Smithson died; Streep passed away shortly thereafter." Tsai gives no indication of what happened to the works in Streep's estate. Tsai, p. 43 n. 59. 20.

In yet another (fig. 5), the snakelike figure of Hitler is shown crucified on (or as?) an airplane; in place of the stigmata there are swastikas, and a cross marks Hitler's belly. The crown of thorns here becomes a pointed fuselage on an airplane fused with the body of the Hitler/AntiChrist, its propulsive motors rendered as tripled forms that resemble screws, studded spikes, or electrical insulators.21 What is the meaning of such apparitions, which some have hinted had their source in peyote or other hallucinogens?22 Are they dementia to be bracketed off, or signs and revelations of more constant motivations 21. For an intriguing comparison, see Smithson's untitled drawing of 1961, which depicts a bearded, flayed-looking (or skeletal) figure crushed under a toppled cross. The cross sprouts tripled blades or tongues of flame that link it to the Hitler drawing's fuselage, but there are multiple differences as well. The drawing is illustrated in Stuart Morgan, "Robert Smithson's Early Work?A Resurrection," Artforum, Vol. 23 no. 8 (April 1985):69. 22. I quote Tsai's footnote in full: "According to the chronology compiled by Alan Moore in Robert Smithson: Drawings, pp. 31-34, Smithson experimented with peyote in 1960. Although it is tempting to see the obsessive quality of these drawings as drug induced, Nancy Holt believes that Smithson had his own interior supply of 'hallucinogens/ Smithson tried peyote only four or five times.

Not surprisingly, I hold with the latter, recognizing all the while that such an interpretation is dominated by the art historian's desire to produce a coherent author from wildly disparate work.23 The postmodern Smithson that emerges in these works (and in these pages) is an artist whose images and ideas are still useful to praxis and theory today?but it should be acknowledged that his coherence is an artifact of my own analysis, and not an integration that depends on intentionality or any attempt to limn the artist's experience of his own subjectivity.24 Chemetzsky, Hobbs, and Holt in Robert Smithson: Sculpture.

Though others seem to want to bracket these suites off?here I note that Tsai (see note 5) included the illustrations of Hitler's Opera only in her essay, and not in the exhibition that it accompanied. To my knowledge, they are still in the estate and have not been sold. 24. Regarding the "integration" of Smithson's personality, it is interesting to note that one of his critics found even Smithson's later drawings to be problematic. Describing him as an intellectual "with a witty, highly integrated personality," Thomas Hess went on to ask: "How could this pragmatic theoretician, who saved his formulations from pedantry only by an edge of the absurd and a talent for self deprecation, produce such a grandly operatic, ambiguous, and, in a sense, visionary art?"

Photograph courtesy of the James Cohan Gallery. Our first analysis of the Hitler suite must involve the fact that the technological fully enters here (as distinct from the earlier, primitivizing Flesh Eater or the strictly expressionistic Christ images). The technological "othering" of Hitler functions for Smithson as a distancing device, protecting him from personal investment in this charged imagery. Without a doubt, the erectile, technologically hardened figure of Hitler is partially a projection from within, as the repressed in Smithson's own identity, but it is also an Other?with technology participating crucially in this oscillating alterity/identity formation.25 Technology reconstructs the boundary between chaos and self that Hitler threatens to destroy; it pins Hitler down and constrains him (motors, unlike Beelzebub, can be turned off), but it also magnifies and extends his power. What is being imagined here is the reconstitution of both body and ego through the hardening process of the technological sublime.26 By 1963, the Blakean style of these drawings and their Boschian imagery began to shift toward more explicit eroticism, much of it copied or traced from pulp pornography or science fiction magazines. Maintaining his technological trajectory, Smithson began to achieve further distance from such loaded images through a variety of means that I have elsewhere grouped and labeled as the "dialectics of the cartouche."27 This crucial dialectic is exemplified here by Second-Stage Injector and Hexagonal Center, both from around 1963-64 (figs. 6 and 7)?a date, it should be noted, that places them just prior to Smithson's acknowledgment of 25. For arguments about Smithson's engagement with the Nazi as other/self, see my Machine in the Studio (see note 9), 290 et passim. Smithson had a long and significant correspondence through the early sixties with a high school friend, Charles Bongiomo, whose homoerotic fantasies about "Nazi physiques" and Catholic punishments led Smithson to think of him as "my Genet." As Klaus Theweleit argues, the crucified/hardened fascist is not exotic; he is all too well known; he is not Other, but Any. See Theweleit's extraordinary Male Fantasies, Vol. 1?Women, Floods, Bodies, History (1977), translated by Stephen Conway (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1987); Vol. 2?Male Bodies: Psychoanalyzing the White Terror (1978), translated by Erica Carter and Chris Turner (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1989). 26. A brief excursus on what I take to be the psychosexual dynamic of the technological sublime: like all experiences of the sublime, the technological sublime recapitulates experiences of early childhood, but does so within a matrix that is culturally specific to a highly industrialized environment. The individual experiences an enormous, potentially threatening, devouring, or absorptive Other in specifically mechanized form. (The Other here is, psychologically speaking, both the bad mother of Kleinian object-relations theory and the Patriarchal Law of Lacanian theorist?both oceanic origin and punishing, civilized terminus of existence.) Because of the Freudian death instinct, the ensuing loss of ego boundaries and shattering of self can be experienced with intoxicating pleasure; as the self fragments, a heady liberation ensues, and the splintered fragments of the self are projected onto the mechanized Other as the oceanic experience develops. Creativity then retrospectively orders this experience through narrative, dream, imagery, music, etc.; if the artwork is successful, the shattered and projected fragments of the self are then taken back (introjected) into the viewer or creator, who is reintegrated in this process. In the technological sublime, some portion of the hardened mechanical other is adopted in introjection. The hardened self is then experienced, at least initially, as enriched?more complete and more powerful than before, yet eerily dependent on the rhythm and dynamic of sublimity for regeneration. Ultimately, the hardened self is a figure for that privileged Lacanian signifier, the Phallus, yet as Lacanians know the experience of claiming it always reinforces its exteriority and unavailability. Hence the desire for the sublime endures. As I hope is obvious from my text, the enormity necessitated for the sublime to occur is an enormity of scale (relation between parts), not size (literal dimensions). It can be found in a grain of sand, a steel filing, or a collage drawing as easily as a screaming steam engine or streaming cataract. The domain of the sublime exists only in representation; it lies in the encounter between the Imaginary and the Symbolic. 27.

Contra Smithson's own, post 1965 judgment, I submit that the deft dialectics of these cartouche works are continuous with Smithson's large-scale works of technological sublimity from a decade later. To take them out of hiding is thus to produce an expanded and immensely more complex author-function?but again, it is one that the living artist might not have acknowledged as coextensive with his own identity. The present essay thus contributes to the posthumous postmodern artist Smithson has now become. Smithson's cartouches borrow, but depart significantly, from their antecedents in Egyptian and Baroque art. They are less formulaic, but also more dialectical in their relationship with their surrounds. Even when shielding the works' actual content from discussion (or view), Smithson recalls the cartouches as crucially transitional in one important 1972 interview: They were sort of proto-psychedelic in a certain kind of way. They were somewhat like cartouches. They freed me from?the whole notion of anthropomorphism. I got that out of my system, you might say.28 The dialectic established between frame and surround (or cartouche and field) became crucial as a model for the relationship between levels of content in Smithson's later work, particularly in the site/nonsite phase of the earthworks to come. Above all, what Smithson adopted in sections of these crucial collages and assemblages is the cooler industrial aesthetic that had already appeared in the works of Stella, Warhol, and others active in the early 1960s (and even earlier, if more ambivalently, in the work of Europeans such as Arman, Klein, and Manzoni, and Japanese Gutai artists such asTanaka and Kanayama). It was this technologism that helped Smithson get something "out of his system," cordoning that "something" off and placing it at a level deeper than the conscious, technologically mastering self. Needless to say, technologism could be experienced as a variation on (or critically surfacing) the cool rational grids Greenberg had imputed to mid-century American modernism. Moving through the paleolithic (1959), religious (1960), and monstrously historic imagery (1961-62), Smithson had, by the end of this last part of his preconscious period (1963-64), made central (quite literally) a technologistic hardening, but he did so in conjunction with a conceptual bracketing that helped channel, contain, and incorporate libidinal flows. Second-Stage Injector effectively illustrates the functioning of the cartouche. Untitled by Smithson, it is identified by the central collage element that advertises a factory precision mold injector, a machine that becomes provocative only in the context of Smithson's surrounding drawing. Framed by images of lounging hermaphrodites, Renaissance grotesques, and nude angels who play basketball and pump gas, the second stage injector becomes a copulatory dyad or triad, its twin precision pumps aimed suggestively into a single form. The goatish man or satyr accosted by the snake at the lower left seems unaccountably calm; he even holds the snake with one languid hand, as if in caress rather than Laoco?n-Iike struggle. Intriguingly, Smithson reveals the external origin of this image by adding a line that bisects the figure's thigh, suggesting the torn edge of a sheet of paper or the intervention of another form. The motif's source is hinted at further in Smithson's undated essay from the mid-1960s, "What Really Spoils Michelangelo's Sculpture," where the reference to "a snake chewing a penis" appears in the midst of an incantatory passage that poetically aligns the decadence of mannerism with what Smithson was beginning to articulate as the desolation and disappointment of his own time.29 Further research reveals that the figure of the old man and the snake is to be found at the lower right corner of Michelangelo's Last Judgment.30 28. Smithson interviewed by Cummings, in Collected Writings (see note 5), p. 289. "Proto" psychedelic implies that their psychedelic quality occurs prior to psychedelia in the world, but by 1963 Op and other "psychedelic" imagery was easily found. Smithson's word choice is calculated to place these works still further into the remote, unconnected past. 29. Robert Smithson, "What Really Spoils Michelangelo's Sculpture," essay published posthumously in Tsai (see note 5): 73. This posthumously published essay is dated by Eugenie Tsai (with the help of Nancy Holt) to 1966 or '67. [Tsai, p. 53, n. 11.] The essay's proximate cause is located by Tsai and Holt in Smithson's antagonism toward Clement Greenberg, whom he had just met and whose essay "Modernist Sculpture: Its Pictorial Past" serves as the epigraph for the "Michelangelo" essay and gives it its title. Given the obsessional tenor of the article and many of its references, I want to argue that some version of it may have been drafted much earlier (and closer in time to the 1963 cartouche drawing I am discussing here). I find unpersuasive in this regard Tsai's dating based on a footnote in the surviving manuscript to a 1966 book by Wolfgang Kayser. Clearly both Greenberg references and this footnote were added after 1966, but the core of the essay may well predate it. In any case, the links between essay and drawing are very strong. 30. It is a depiction of Minos, Prince of Hell, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Michelangelo's enemy Biagio da Cesena, the papal master of ceremonies who had called the top half of the unfinished Judgment a "stufa d'ignudi" (bath house) when it was shown to intimates in 1540.

Perhaps this textual alienation indicates the impossibility of art "knowing" anything; or, more intriguingly, perhaps the quotation marks suggest the kind of "knowing" alluded to in the Bible? knowledge linked intimately to the body's capacity for pleasure, and the mind's for shame. Clearly Second Stage Injector and the other untitled cartouche drawings of 1963 and '64 are engaged in this latter type of "'knowledge' of corruption," a knowledge that initiates a calculus of gains and losses as it navigates the eddies of libido in Smithson's art. The artist's important insight here was that technology could bear the burden of his "'knowledge' of corruption," appearing innocent, "blind," and sheltered in its cartouche?but embedded in a libidinal economy that gives it a dense erotic significance. The second collage drawing to be discussed here, Hexagonal Center, is much sparer in its imagery, and differs in its compositional strategy by using an assertively geometric boundary between the collaged cartouche and pornographic surround. Dominated by twelve nesting hexagons, which alternate between colors of light and dark value to form a highly decorative pattern, the drawing presents an illusion of deep spatial recession, a vortex converging on the center of the cartouche. The innermost hexagon, which reads as the hole at the end of this recessive polygonal well?or the opening shutter of a camera?contains a fragment of the School of Fontainbleau betrothal painting of Gabrielle d'Estr?es from 1594, now in the Louvre. The fragment centers on the charged erotic gesture made by the betrothed's sister, who reaches over and delicately pinches the erect nipple of the bride's breast to demonstrate its succulence and availability. The technological hardening that Smithson uses to separate this center from the flowing surround is not industrial machinery in this case, but geometry. Like the polygonal Violet Paintings with open centers that Frank Stella had exhibited that same year, Smithson's hexagonal shaped form is also open. Rather than reveal the blank gallery wall, however, Smithson embeds a view of the spectacle of sexual exchange that undergirds both political marriages and commodity culture. Moreover, rather than Stella's stable, concentric polygonal bands, Smithson's nested hexagons are built of triangular sections, each tilted within the other. The entire configuration is placed off-kilter to convey a spiraling tunnel of tumbling and collapsing geometric forms. The controlling geometry in Smithson's polygonal forms is seemingly affected by the echo of eroticized margins and contents, and destabilization of the nested hexagons stimulates our own, as we brace ourselves from falling visually into the "knowledge of corruption" that Smithson and d'Estr?es seem to offer. Within a short time, the dialectics of the cartouche would appear to have done their semi-private job, as Smithson celebrated his "real breakthrough" in 1964 (with fabricated works of mirrored plastic and/or metal, such as Gyrostasis). The breakthrough, again, as Smithson recalled it in 1972: . . . came once I was able to overcome this lurking pagan religious anthropomorphism. I was able to get into crystalline structures [that were] essentially abstract and devoid of any kind of mythological content. ... I had completely gotten rid of that problem.32 Smithson's oft-stated claims to purgation ("I got that out of my system," "I had completely gotten rid of that problem") suggest the importance of the reaction formation represented by the cartouches; such phrases also enforce the bracketing and hiding that I want to question here. As a sign of the necessary boundary he needed to erect between the preconscious and mature periods, in 1972 Smithson collapsed his narrative of purgation to a single sculpture from 1964.33 But other conjunctions provide a more complicated view. It seems that throughout the period from 1960 to 1964 Smithson was struggling "between the organic and the crystalline," as he later put it; in fact he described it as "tug-of-war" between biological and technologistic forms. Tellingly for my argument that connections (rather second edition, published in 1954.

But as we have seen, the foundation for this dialectic was already in place by 1963 with the cartouche drawings, if not by the even earlier Hitler suite in 1961. The point to be made by revealing Smithson's enforcement of the shifting boundaries between an "organic" and a "crystalline" phase is that such separations were necessarily retrospective in their construction. There may have been important transitions marked by each of these phases of work, but they were collapsed and codified in Smithson's narrative with one purpose: to push the earlier works farther away, and to bring later, more univalent works into more "generative" focus, as the industrially minded artworld of the mid-1960s seemed to require. The paramount objective seems to have been to construct, retrospectively, an impervious boundary between a supposedly unproductive premature period and a post-1965 maturity.35 The emergence of a new, mature artist is staged precisely (and erroneously) in the few months between late 1964 and early 1965, when Smithson made his first minimal sculptures but had not yet published any of his incantatory essays. But such constructed separations were never entirely complete. Traces of the flowing, bleeding, puddling, spiritual, erotic, hairy "organic" negotiated with a metallic, faceted, spiky, geometric, hardened, scientistic, technological, and controlling "crystalline" industrial aesthetic in all of Smithson's works, and, I would propose, those traces are what fuels our continued fascination with Smithson some twenty-five years later. Ultimately, the justification for my resurrection of Smithson's buried past lies in such arguments?that there are underlying continuities between the early, preconscious works and the mature production, and that these continuities reveal qualities that inhere in the mature works but are difficult to see without the example of the hidden production. In this essay, I must restrict my proof of a linkage between preconscious and conscious Smithson works to a single, but I think compelling, example?a drawing for the minimalist sculpture Gyrostasis made in 1968 (fig. 8). Situated squarely in the middle of Smithson's most "conscious" production, Gyrostasis has most often been inserted (if uneasily) into a genealogy of minimalism. But its ancestors were mixed, and its progeny far more hybrid, than the minimalists would like us to believe. As the drawing indicates, Smithson took sections of a set of nested hexagons to generate the sculpture's form. From even this cursory description, my claim is obvious: the hexagons in this drawing relate directly to the preconscious hexagonal cartouche from 1963?the cool geometry of the "Gyrostasis" drawing maps directly onto that destabilized, eroticized, ocular well. Although dated half a decade apart, the forms are eerily congruent, beginning with the fact that in each drawing there are exactly the same number of hexagons nested together. While any such correlation between the configurations could be coincidental, the odds are against it. Smithson is said to have kept the cartouche drawings "in a drawer when he was not working on them," keeping them both private and literally "at hand" until they surfaced in his estate following his death.36 This does not mean, of course, that Smithson "meant" for us to find them (although clearly the managers of the estate did). Free from any such claims of artistic intentionality, I merely want to assert that these encrypted but preserved works allow us to construct a posthumous Smithson who can be seen as more complexly dialectical for a longer period. Lending further support to the argument that the three-dimensional sculpture Gyrostasis is deeply linked to such two-dimensional inquiries from the early 1960s is the fact that the sculpture is figured only on its face (like the drawing), with some articulation on the sides, but none on the back.37 The back of the sculpture is as smooth and unfaceted as the paper's verso, revealing the sculpture to be more purely a relief or "thick drawing" than a free-standing object conceived as a number of solid masses shifting in space.38 Intriguingly, Smithson 34.

I quote: The title Gyrostasis refers to a branch of physics that deals with rotating bodies, and their tendency to maintain their equilibrium. . . . When I made the sculpture I was thinking of mapping procedures that refer to the planet Earth. One could consider it as a crystallized fragment of a gyroscopic rotation, or as an abstract three dimensional map that points to the Spiral Jetty, 1970 in the Great Salt Lake, Utah.40 In place of an eroto-scopic section (the nested hexagons), we have a gyro-scopic rotation (the mapping of the Earth); the one has its origins in the preconscious period, the other explicitly reaches toward Smithson's most famous and successful conscious work. The precarious equilibrium Smithson sees as being maintained by Gyrostasis is highly leveraged, connected as it is to the disequilibrated forms of the suppressed erotic cartouche, on the one hand, and his most famous work, the polysemous Spiral Jetty (fig. 1), on the other. In the light cast by the preconscious cartouche drawings, the Jetty is not so much a triumph of technologically mediated sublimity, as Lawrence Alloway had described it in 1970, but a force for cfe-sublimation?a postmodern desublimation that begins to denaturalize the effects of the technological sublime even as it invokes them.41 The of the Spiral Jetty, the film of the 7e?y, and the proposed film for the Island of Broken Glass.

I use the term "desublimation" in ways utterly different from those introduced by Herbert Marcuse in his One Dimensional Man:</page><page sequence="15">30 RES 41 SPRING 2002 water that the Jetty encloses is not only an oceanic expanse, but the medium sustaining the puddling flows and erotic beings that float beyond the boundaries of the other, more geometric spirals in Smithson's work. The materialized Jetty's crystalline path is not only a rocky bulwark that keeps the organic at bay, but the unstable half of a dialectic, slipping under water and tumbling inward in constant negotiation with the libidinous "knowledge" Smithson earlier professed. The organically polluted, reddening waters that negotiate with the Jetty's salt-encrusted rocks are inextricably part of the work, not background to the "gesture" of the Jetty's arc. One could argue that the retrieval of Smithson's preconscious production has in some way been author ized by the artist's own essays, where Michelangelo knows corruption, the pipes of Passaic copulate homoerotically, and minimalist artworks are seen to involve a kind of "fossilized sexuality."42 But it should be emphasized that the essays, too, are ambiguous. Their clues parapraxes are but other seductions, beckoning the historian/analyst to disentangle them and luring us to coax their complex forms toward (unattainable) fixed meanings. Our desire is not disinterested; we seek to construct a coherent identity by weaving the primitive, libidinous (oceanic) id into functioning unity with the hardened (technological and geometric) superego. Nor should we deny that this coherent identity may only be "ours," in the sense that it is we who make meaning of the artist's works in a postmodern frame, and we who attempt to suture his secrets into subjectivity, after death. Posthumous Smithsons Robert Smithson died suddenly at the age of thirty one, when the plane he had chartered to survey an earthworks site in Texas smashed into a rocky hillside. The violence and immediacy of this death (pilot and photographer were also instantly killed) ensured that Smithson's ten-year enforcement of conscious and preconscious careers would allow no further negotiation on his part.43 The artist's 1973 demise necessarily marked the end of Smithson's "conscious" phase, and created the possibility that the "preconscious" Smithson could be, as art historian Eugenie Tsai put it, "unearthed."44 The unexpected beginning of Smithson's posthumous career coincided with the artworld's proclamations of postmodernism?a word that Smithson had only just begun to use in his conversations?and the absent artist became a present, potent force in the theorization of that productive episteme. The tensions evident in the posthumous Smithson are in some ways simpler than those we located in the conscious one, but they have not been resolved. Would Smithson have allowed the rock-and-water component of Spiral Jetty's discursive complex to remain inundated by the rising level of the Great Salt Lake, or would he have attempted to arrest its deluvian decline and render matter more important than mind?45 Would he have reconstituted the bits of an Untitled (Mica and Glass) piece found in the basement of his building, as his dealer did, or would he have discarded it during some inevitable work/living space relocation? Would he have used his enormous stash of Instamatic camera slides, negatives, and contact sheets for future artworks, or stashed them away as mere records of his travels? These questions have all been addressed in one way or another, but nothing is permanent. Ongoing judgments are made daily by the executors of the Robert Smithson Estate, individuals of probity who are neither scandalous nor exceptional in their efforts to resolve an unresolvable author. They are merely doing their job, choosing from the constant stream of possibilities that emerge as options in forming the Studies in the Ideology of Advanced Industrial Society (Boston: Beacon Press, 1964). For Marcuse, sublimation is the highest form that artistic alienation can take, the "Great Refusal" by defiant avant-gardists of the order of the day; by contrast, desublimation is "truly conformist" and linked to "the making of the authoritarian personality of our time" (pp. 63, 76, 74). "Desublimation" in the sense I want to use it is closer to deconstruction, an unravelling of the sublimatory system such that the originary impulses and instincts become evident, and resistible if wished. See my Machine in the Studio (see note 9). 42. See Smithson's essays "What Really Spoils Michelangelo's Sculpture," "The Monuments of Rassaic," and "Entropy and the New Monuments," respectively, all published in Collected Writings.

The material form of the Jetty was covered soon after its completion, and continues to ebb and flow with the level of the lake. Discussion still eddies around what Smithson might have eventually done about the situation. Nancy Holt, the artist's widow and clearly the most important force in Smithson's posthumous career, believes he wanted to build it back up; now that the Jetty has been given to the Dia Foundation, and recent media references to the work suggest that it has "tragically" deteriorated, the stage is set for the physical Jetty to be rebuilt.</page><page sequence="16">Jones: Preconscious/posthumous Smithson 31 continuing presence of an author-function Smithson as we continue to desire him.46 The first watershed for the construction of the posthumous Smithson was, of course, the publication of the collected Writings in 1979.47The book was in every sense a labor of love?Smithson's widow, artist Nancy Holt, was the editor; the book's design was contributed by conceptual artist Sol LeWitt; the black-and-white publication was produced by New York University Press (whose offices are near where Smithson and Holt had their work/live space). The compilation of Smithson's writings into book form gave these essays an immediate force in the artworld, a force far greater than the sum of their influence as intermittent publications. As with Clement Greenberg's Art and Culture, the act of collation was also an act of codification?just as Greenberg's passing journalistic edicts became modernism's law, Smithson's quirky, evolving rhetoric became essential components in postmodernism's strategic handbook. The essays' pivotal role for an emerging discourse of postmodernism was immediately foregrounded by theorist, critic, and art history graduate student Craig Owens in his review of the Writings for October magazine (titled "Earthwords"), in which he asserted, "That Smithson thus transformed the visual field into a textual one represents one of the most significant aesthetic 'events' of our decade; and the publication of his collected writings constitutes a challenge to criticism to come to terms with . . . postmodernism in general."48 Owens's move was extremely significant, for it communicated not only that a younger generation was adopting Smithson as their spokesman, but that this adoption would be accomplished through Smithson's texts, that is, through a Smithson constructed almost wholly as an author-function. There were important Smithson exhibitions in the late 1970s and early 1980s, to be sure, but the writings gained increasing prominence in the absence of Smithson himself (or any potentially troubling "late works"). The inundation of the Jetty seemed to guarantee that the conceptual basis of his work would take precedence over a view of Smithson as a physical manipulator of matter, or even as a producer of images with historically prior iconographies or sources that might be seen to inform their interpretation.49 Thus, even as Smithson was seen to be against the historicist elements of postmodernist pastiche, he was also positioned as crucial for its more critical operations.50 The very tenets of postmodernism's critique of the unique, fetishized modernist object took shape around the name of Smithson (as in Owens's practice), only a few years after his death. In this argument, the Spiral Jetty doesn't have to exist to be art in a postmodern frame?we need only the photographs, the film, the essay, and the consistent author-name from which to append this discourse, and upon which to exercise our own.51 Even if this postmodern critique of authorship would seem, paradoxically, to author-ize posthumous recreations of Smithson's site-specific installations, the appearance of such remakes as early as the late 1970s stimulated a certain unease among critics in New York. But rarely were concerns expressed by those intellectuals who celebrated Smithson's role in postmodernism?the negatives came instead from critics still following the tenets of a beleaguered connoisseurship: No matter how explicit his instructions might be, the completed piece could not have that inimitable mark of Smithson's own participation, which survived even when the work was almost as big as the pyramids. So the small posthumous pieces at the John Weber Gallery might have looked like reproductions or counterfeits. If they don't, it is partly because the power of Smithson's imagination turns out to persist even at one remove. It is also because the combination of looking glass with white-and-silver dust from a mine nominated by Smithson himself is specifically his own.52 This rather confused response on the part of a New York Times critic in the late 1970s was typical, but reactions 46.

Just as the artworld judges, cruelly, that some artists have lived too long (Picasso, Dali, and de Kooning being contested examples), so it finds its easiest heroes in the untimely dead (Pollock offering another instance). Smithson, an extremely acerbic interlocutor, might have antagonized more than ingratiated those in Owens's generation, had he been alive. 50.

Clipping in the files of the Smithson Estate.</page><page sequence="17">32 RES 41 SPRING 2002 became a bit sharper in the 1980s, when the gap between the slightly messy quality of "conscious" Smithson and the glossier (more marketable?) posthumous author began to be observed: "Smithson wasn't terrific at the slick finish. In those first modular boxes from the early to mid-sixties, the edges don't quite meet, the paint drips, and the intervals aren't mathematically precise," writes New York Magazine critic Kay Larson. Noting that Smithson's Cayuga Salt Mine piece had been entirely reconstructed for a recent exhibition by the Estate's managers, "using new mirrors and newly mined salt," Larson commented, "there is some question about how far one can go in remaking Smithson, but this show does not attempt to address it."53 Smithson's engagements with entropy, ruins, sublimity, and the picturesque opens precisely onto such questions?"how far can one go" in remaking works that were themselves records of encounters with rotting urban peripheries and industrially devastated sites? Smithson's artworks were always about the slow collapse of all systems into entropie disorganization (the "heat death of the universe" was a favorite thematic at the time). Partially Buried Woodshed (fig. 9) is a perfect example of his works' uneasy balance between dereliction and sublimity, and it serves us here as a case study of the impossibility of maintaining that balance over time. The piece was completed at Kent State University in January 1970 (a few months before the tragic encounter between campus anti-war demonstrators and the fully armed U.S. National Guard, who killed four students and wounded nine others). Partially Buried Woodshed was, from the beginning, a compromise between one entropy and another, produced in lieu of a mudflow (which couldn't happen because the weather was too cold). The project consisted of loading twenty truckloads of earth onto half of an existing woodshed until the central supporting beam cracked. As was usual in his earthworks practice, Smithson supervised the backhoe operator and photographer (the latter told to take pictures only of the earthmoving equipment and the shed, not the scores of students milling about). He left campus shortly thereafter, donating his entropie anti monument to the university with a note as to its value ($10,000) and this parting comment: "The entire work of art is subject to weathering which should be considered part of the work."54 Weather the work did?grass grew on its collapsed roof, someone painted "May 4 Kent 70" in white on what had once been a window in the woodshed, denoting the date of the Kent State Massacre (as it became known).55 After Smithson's death, Nancy Holt pressed for the work's preservation; University opposition to the (newly politicized) "eyesore" mounted. An arsonist torched the unburied half of the work in 1975, after which a Kent State sculpture teacher and his students tenderly cleaned the burned fragments from the shed. Pressured by the New York artworld, who peppered then-Vice President Nelson Rockefeller with letters, the university agreed not to destroy the work. But should it be "maintained" like any other artwork? The piece lingered in a state of uneasily halted entropy. As one local supporter concluded in 1978: "in the lonely cold of the end of the century's severest winter Robert Smithson's Partially Buried Woodshed remains a haunting and controversial work visited mostly by vandals and dogs, and poets."56 In the 1980s, the University cordoned off the site with a ring of trees. The Woodshed's dialectic with disaster was temporarily resolved in the 1990s, when the structure finally collapsed and University bulldozers cleared the site. (See Renee Green's recent video revisitation, Partially Buried.) Although Smithson wanted "weathering" to be a part of such works, it is only posthumous interventions that added man-made disasters to the geological time-frames about which the artist wrote. When one includes the natural catastrophes that beset Spiral Jetty, Smithson's beloved "entropy" appears in a fast-forward mode of rising water, arson flames, and university development plans. Perhaps it is not surprising, given the vulnerability of works materialized through some actual manipulation of the earth's crust (not to mention the unmarketability of such things), that the bulk of Smithson exhibitions in the late 1990s have emphasized his photographs. This posthumous Smithson is relatively portable, adapts readily to museum insurance policies, and can still be "curated," framed, lit with honey spots, and isolated from the vagaries of appropriation and/or neglect. 53.

Smithson's attitude toward the photographic can best be described as suspicious. His need for photographs and his despair at their ossification were irreconcilable halves of his ambivalence. Cameras were "indifferent mechanical eyes" for him, "ready to devour anything in sight."57 By the same token, he understood that our views of reality have become so conditioned by photography that we experience the world as always already photographed?the artist's act of taking a snapshot of a bridge in P?ssaic, New Jersey, "was like photographing a photograph:" The sun became a monstrous light bulb that projected a detached series of 'stills' through my Instamatic into my eye. When I walked on the bridge, it was as though I was walking on an enormous photograph that was made of wood and steel . . .58 Smithson's sardonic attitude toward "fine art" photography was reflected in his choice of camera, frequently identified in his essays as a "Kodak Instamatic reflex"?the key term here being "Instamatic." Rather than apprentice himself to the artisanal tradition of meticulous exposure calculations, hand-tinting, spotting, dodging, or platinum-printing, Smithson adopted the camera's "instant" and "automatic" gaze, which filtered, boxed, and compressed any landscape into a ready made grid.59 Equally acceptable to him were others' photographs, whether the mass-mediated ones that cropped up in early collages (figs. 6 and 7, for example), the snapshots taken by friends, or those commissioned glossies produced by professional photographers brought in to document a work. Crucial to the making of-meaning for his site/non-site work Slate from Bangor, Pennsylvania, for example, was the photograph he published with it in 1968 (fig. 11)?a photograph taken by (and credited to) his dealer, Virginia Dwan. Smithson's casual attitude toward these appropriations and collaborations is entirely in keeping with the postmodernist scorn for the unique object or the singular author; such practices are at odds, however, with the fetishizing operations of market and museum. From registration databases to invoice and alphabetization systems, institutions have much invested in claims that a work is not merely "selected," "archived," "arranged," or "curated" by the artist, but deeply, materially, and physically "created" by him. Thus it is perhaps no surprise that the "Robert Smithson: Photo Works" traveling exhibition from 1993 included photographs taken by professional photographers (which Smithson never claimed to be), framed, installed, and labeled with the Smithson name.60 Morbidly enough, even Smithson's battered camera was installed in its own vitrine (in the New York venue, at least). Recovered from the plane wreck that killed him, it was displayed like a relic next to the photographs, as if to lend further authenticity (or should we say aura, or author-'ity?) to the images on view. The book accompanying the exhibition displayed more circumspection. Stills from the film Spiral Jetty, for example, are captioned as "Robert Smithson (with Robert Fiore)"?the gifted independent filmmaker who served as cameraman on the film is given his (parenthetical) due. Negatives that Smithson left in contact print form, and film outtakes, are often reproduced in a similar mode in the book, laid out in strips along the edge of the catalogue's page. But some layouts are not so clear. Photographs are often reproduced in significantly larger format than the 3-by 3-inch drugstore prints that Smithson routinely ordered. Captions must be read closely to distinguish between these "vintage gelatin-silver prints" and those posthumous "gelatin-silver prints from original negatives."61 The celebration of a postmodern Smithson thus bifurcates. There is the leftist intellectuals' Smithson, a discursive author-function whose essays and film are seen as crucial components of an ongoing practice that operates together with the materialized objects and earthworks to stimulate the highest level of conceptual activity in the arts. And there is the institutionalized and collectible Smithson, more often described as a "land 57. Smithson, "Art through the Camera's Eye," unpublished essay in Tsai (see note 5) p. 89. 58.

(Emphasis added) Ibid., p. 88. 60. Smithson's project Concrete Pour, 1969, was photographed when he was out of town, which was the whole point, since it was produced for an exhibition titled "Art by Telephone" at Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art in November of that year. The image of the work was retrieved from his papers, now at the Archives of American Art, and included as a print and reversed photostat in the exhibition. See pp. 62 and 63 of Robert A. Sobieszek, Robert Smithson: Photo Works (Los Angeles and Albuquerque: Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and University of New Mexico Press, 1993). The show traveled to New York's International Center of Photography in February, 1994, where the camera was on view. 61.

Estate of Robert artist" than an earthworks maker (because "land" is ownable, where earth is not.)62 This second Smithson has been gradually transformed from being a user of photographs to a photographer, full stop. Perhaps the apogee of this second Smithson is the 1997 Italian exhibition and publication project Robert Smithson Slideworks, which also traveled to several U.S. venues and may even now be continuing to transform itself.63 Here the scholarly apparatus of Photo Works drops away, and there are no longer quite so many careful footnotes or nuanced captions. Elisions in the text move from "slides" to "photographs," acknowledging that "these images are not individual shots or frames," but failing to draw any lines between those prints Smithson chose to have made for display and distribution, and those that were retained in files and packets of contact prints as copious photographic "notes" of various sites. The only remnant of such distinctions is vestigial, residing in the "slide-" prefix of the project's title. Vestigial because, in fact, no slides were on view (at least in the 1998 installation at the Rose Art Museum in Massachusetts). What the viewer experienced in the gallery were instead glossy, large-scale chromogenic prints, beautifully framed, labelled, and lit; the book's color-corrected reproductions are equally sumptuous, 62. I am grateful to historian and philosopher of science Peter Galison for this last insight. Readers of Heidegger (as is Galison) know that "earth" signals a cthonic level prior to knowledge, society, and philosophy itself. In this regard, see also the meditations of Gary Schapiro in his Heideggerian Earthwards: Robert Smithson and Art after Babel (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995). 63.

("Photographs steal away the spirit of the work."64) The purveyors of posthumous Smithson #1 (the "intellectual" Smithson, my own personal favorite) should not necessarily object to this posthumous Smithson #2 (the "collector's" Smithson). Perhaps at one level of analysis we could see them as mutually constitutive, or, in Smithson's preferred mode of thinking, dialectical.65 Posthumous Smithson #2 is an artifact, a production like any other that deserves to be understood as part of the author-function we all work discursively to maintain. While he lived, Smithson was "interested in the apparatus I'm being threaded through," and indeed, there is much to analyze in the posthumous threading of the discursive postmodern artist.66 There are times when Smithson #1 might even be brought to bear on Smithson #2, the critical intellectual used to dismantle the myth of the isolated art object in its tidy metal frame (certainly Smithson #2 has troubled, in my mind, the complacent avant-gardism of Smithson #1). Glossy portable objects might well qualify as the kinds of entities Smithson had disparaged in one interview as the "Kantian" basis of modernism, appearing seductively as that essential Ding an Sich that might transcend the circumstances of its making. Mocking modernism's appropriation of such Kantian narratives of artistic essence, the conscious Smithson once opined: Paintings are bought and sold. The artist sits in his solitude, knocks out his paintings, assembles them, then waits for someone to confer the value, some external source. . . . Art has tended to be viewed in terms of isolation, neutralization, separation, and this is encouraged. Art is supposed to be on some eternal plane, free from the experiences of the world[?by contrast,] I'm more interested in those experiences. . . . I just want to be conscious of where I am, in relationship to all these different parameters.67 [Emphasis added] Obviously my intervention intends to bring this Smithson to bear on its market-driven doppelg?nger. I want to mourn the brevity of Smithson's active propagation ofthat useful, critical consciousness, bracketed between his early minimalism and the essays and earthworks that followed, his reputation spiralling out from that unbelievably short eight-year period. The posthumous Smithsons I have been describing have been animated by other agents in our discursive web; my efforts here have been to make us conscious of that process. Even you, dear reader, must choose your Smithsons from mine and others'. Naturally I hope you will choose the critical postmodernist from whom we can still teach ourselves so much. John Weber, dealer for the Smithson Estate at the time of the Slideworks exhibition, explained the motivations for the project this way: "We think the work is so fantastic, we wanted this work to be seen. . . . It's a sense of immortality?it's just amazing, he's still alive!"68 What the critical postmodernist might point to is the uncanny nature of this "life," and who is living it. As appropriation artist Sherry Levine said, a decade after Smithson's own demise, "my work is about death in a way; the uneasy death of modernism."69 Modernism's morbidity hides in many crannies of the preconscious and the conscious Smithson, as well as the postmodern and the posthumous ones. But some of those Smithsons also left us with the critical tools to unmask the walking dead. 64. Slideworks (see note 63), p. 153. 65.
