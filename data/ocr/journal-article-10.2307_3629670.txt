Leach King's College, Cambridge, United Kingdom THE NEAPOLITAN PHILOSOPHER OF HISTORY, Giambattista Vico, is my favorite eighteenth-century author. Much of what he wrote appears on first reading to be absolute nonsense, but then, on reflection, one comes to realize that behind the nonsense there is a sense, and perhaps a rather important sense. In recent times L&amp;vi-Strauss has used this same formula as justification for his own procedures for the analysis of myth. There may be sense behind the non-sense. The particular Vico proposition that is relevant in the present case is his argument that since emotions and feelings are more fundamental and universal than human reason-people must have talked as poets before they came to argue rationally and, following this same theme, it is more straightforward to express emotions in forms of art than to describe them in prose sentences-we should assume that, in the course of human evolution, writing came before speech. As an example of this he cited the hieroglyphics of ancient Egypt, which at that period were considered to be a system of mystic symbols rather than a transcription of verbal texts, as they are now known to be. Now I am not suggesting that you should follow Vico in thinking that people expressed themselves in art and poetic sounds before they possessed language proper. Indeed, from my point of view, it makes no sense at all to talk about primeval human beings devoid of spoken language, since I consider spoken language an essential constituent of what we mean by humanity. On the other hand Vico was certainly right to emphasize that all human beings are capable of expressing ideas in media other than either spoken language or writing of the ordinary sort, which is just a transcription of speech forms. The members of all societies, complex as well as primitive, externalize the ideas they hold about the physical and metaphysical universes, and about the social relations within their own society, by making and manipulating artifacts. The clothes we wear, the houses we live in, the decorated structures with which we surround ourselves, the paths we construct through such human worlds, are all expressive of human ideas, some of which are perfectly well known at a conscious level of experience, while others are only dimly perceived and exist only as sets of relations 243</page><page sequence="2">244 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH within the artificially constructed world of culture. Many of the most interesting innovations in social and cultural anthropology during the past thirty years have been concerned, in one way or another, with devising means to "decode" the messages which are thus embodied in human artifacts and their combinations. Although there is a perfectly proper sense in which such cultural encoding of ideas can be spoken of as constituting a "language," you need to understand that the analogy is closer to a computer language than to ordinary human speech. We should not expect too much of our decoding exercises. On the other hand, there are, at certain levels, significant parallels between spoken languages and the languages of nonverbal cultural communication. My present argument relates to one such parallel-namely, the overriding importance of context. At one level the whole argument is about whether objects have aesthetic value in themselves or only because of the context in which they are viewed. At another level there are two interwoven aspects to the discussion. To be pompous, this paper is about the space syntax of sacred buildings. In simpler language it is concerned with a very simple question: Why do architects make such a fuss about the entrances to grandiose buildings? Linked with this question is another: Does the iconography which is used to decorate grandiose entrances have any distinguishing characteristics? If so, what are they? These are both very large topics, and as it is unlikely that you have ever thought at all carefully about either of them, I shall not be able to get very far in this one paper. But I hope I can show you that the questions are interesting. First one or two very general remarks about context. A morpheme of spoken language does not become a meaningful word except in the context of other words of the same language, and a sequence of words does not make sense unless it is constructed according to grammatical rules of some sort. A meaningful utterance is something other than a list of separate sounds. We take this for granted in the case of human sounds; we do not take it for granted in the case of human objects of a more material kind. Indeed the convention of our own culture is that there exists a class of human objects, which can be looked at in museum galleries or as illustrations in a picture book, which rate as "works of art," evidently possessing "meaning" or "aesthetic value" quite regardless of the context in which they are viewed. And it is manifestly the case that, provided we start off with assumptions of this kind about the nature of art, we can respond aesthetically to objects which have been torn out of their original context and put into some kind of art gallery. Therein lies my puzzle. But I have a problem of presentation. Most of the objects I shall be talking about are in India. Two dimensional illustrations are a very inadequate substitute for the magic carpet that is needed to transport us to the other side of the earth, in order to view these things in context. The two ladies in Figure 1 are now in museums. They are made of pinkish stone. It seems to me that anyone brought up in the tradition of aesthetic values which is now accepted in Europe and America would rate them as beautiful objects in themselves. Certainly if they turned up in a fashionable auction room in London or New York they would fetch spectacular prices. And why not? Can we, as Westerners, ever get any further than that? What difference could it make to look at such things in their original context? Context</page><page sequence="3">Figure la. Girl writing a letter. Khajuraho region. Figure lb.

Why should one be academic? Why should anyone bother whether these images are supposed to depict apsaras ("celestial beings"), surasundaris ("celestial messengers"), nayikas ("human women", "ladies of the court"), or devadasis ("temple prostitutes," or "temple dancers")? In fact, different "authorities" have described them as belonging to each of these four categories. I myself would argue that this kind of pedantry is indeed quite irrelevant. All the same I do think that original context matters, because, while I concede that meaning may be inherent in things as such, it is also inherent in relations, in the contrasts and similarities between things. And, to a very limited extent, I believe that we can decode such meaning. The issue is a general problem of semantics. How far does meaning "exist" in isolated chunks which can be laid out in a row, as in a line of type? How far is it an accumulation of superimposed indications which derive from the relationships between separate entities laid either side by side or one on top of another? Ordinary spoken discourse, straightforward prose, is more or less linear. A competent speaker will say one thing at a time, and what is said will be unambiguous. But in poetry and mythology, and in all forms of artistic expression, metaphor is the name of the game; there are layers of superimposed meanings, all of which are equally a part of what is being said. In religious context this has a corollary; since ordinary language and ordinary visual images refer to entities in the real physical world, and since the ideas we class as "religion" all entail entities of an "unreal," metaphysical kind, religion can only be talked about or represented by metaphor. Let us return to the two ladies in Figure 1. So long as we are prepared to regard them as strictly secular objects made of stone, we can, up to a point, appreciate them as beautiful objects in their own right. As soon as we take note that they were originally part of the decoration of a temple, however, we have to concede that, in some sense, they may have religious implications-the physical stone may stand for metaphysical ideas, and there may be moral significance in the imagery. In that case we shall be losing out if we cannot recognize the metaphors. Is there any way around this kind of difficulty? First of all, what do we mean by religious? What is a religious context? Could it make any difference? In this particular case we know at least the architectural context. The ladies we were just looking at are now in a museum. The one in Figure 2, who comes from the same group of North Indian temples at Khajuraho, is still in situ. The tourist guides and the picture books describe her as a temple prostitute, the attribution being due presumably to the scorpion on her leg, which certainly suggests that she has witch-like qualities of some sort. But she is obviously a very close cousin to the lady in the middle of Figure 3, who also appears quite frequently in the picture books, either by herself or else in a group such as this. She is then described as an apsara, a celestial being, presumably because the properly clothed male figure at her side is in a devotional stance and has four arms, and is therefore a deity. I must emphasize that this is not an isolated juxtaposition; they exist by the score. The scholarly theorizing about these temples gyrates around just this point. Should we infer from such sculptures that the cult for which these temples were designed was concerned with ascetic devotion or with tantric eroticism?</page><page sequence="5">GATEKEEPERS OF HEAVEN 247 kP Isq ..i :: ab'-, * Figure 2.

The leogryph is always shown struggling with men but in a curiously gentle, fondling fashion, like the angel of the Lord who wrestled all night with Jacob. That seemingly casual cross-reference to the Bible is not just an aside. In this paper I take most of my illustrations from India, but I am not trying to expound the intricacies of tantric philosophy; my problems are of a much more general kind. Surely both the similarity and the differences between the two ladies who are taking off their panties, who stand quite close together as part of the same building, must "mean" something, and we lose this something if we consider either by herself, without the other. I do not want to argue that such juxtapositions necessarily make all the difference. I just want to consider the problem: Do such sculptures as groups signify more than each figure taken by itself? What about "religious context"? We can argue at length about definitions of religion, but we can surely agree that the category of material construction which we denote by the word "shrine" is fairly easily identifiable and that, in sophisticated societies in which the ruling class display its power through forms of conspicuous consumption, shrines are elaborated into permanent edifices to which we usually attach the label "temple," or "church". We can also perhaps concede that human kings merge into superhuman gods and that the palaces of divine kings have a very similar ground plan to the layout of temples. To that I would add that, topologically speaking, the basic layout of all kinds of temples and palaces the world over is almost completely standardized.</page><page sequence="7">GATEKEEPERS OF HEAVEN 249 Obviously I cannot possibly demonstrate completely that last preposterously grandiose proposition, but let me give you one or two examples. Coedes (1963:41) has remarked of the ruins of the thirteenth-century Cambodian temple city of Angkor Thom that, Unlike our western cities, it was not just a group of houses, a market and a seat of government: it was a replica in miniature of the fabled world of Hindu cosmology, a small model of the universe, a microcosm. According to Brahman ideas the world consisted of a central continent, Jambudvipa, with Meru, the cosmic mountain, rising at its centre. This continent was encircled by six concentric rings of land, separated by seven oceans, the outer one of which was enclosed by a rock wall. At the summit of Meru was the city of Brahma, the home of the Gods, sur- rounded by the eight guardians at the cardinal points. Similarly, regarding the Ancient Egyptian temple of Edfu, dating from about the third century B.C., the present professor of Egyptology at Oxford (Baines 1976: 10) comments that: It has long been recognised that Egyptian temples have a cosmographic function. They mimic and record the structure of the world. As this recording is not direct but is filtered by conven- tions of representation, classification and symbolism, and may frequently be expressed in terms of myth, the study of temples should yield results for our understanding of Egyptian ideology in general. The particular relevance of cosmography to a temple's function as the god's dwelling and cult centre is clear. The god's dwelling is a world and to describe the world is to praise it, so that the temple unites the two functions in a single symbol. Despite the separation of continents and fifteen centuries the religious ideology is the same. In the Edfu case the layout presupposes a central core which is the shrine proper (or throne room). This is surrounded by concentric box-like spaces and a more elaborate sequence of graded spaces leading to the outer entrance. Hindu temples of more recent date, which can be observed more intimately because they are still in use, show that the principal shrine at the center is nearly always supplemented by subsidiary shrines, which are encountered on the way in or out at each successive threshold, and there is always a relatively major shrine-like edifice just inside or outside the main entrance. The ground plan is not always rectangular; it may be circular or apse-shaped, but the nested arrangement by which the human visitor moves from the secular world outside through a series of screened stages, each with its own shrine-like gateway, seems to be invariable. At Khajuraho the shrine proper is at the core. The series of courts (mandappa) leading to the outside world were intended for musicians and dancers and for other forms of semiritual/semisecular performance. In many temples, the whole structure is distinguished from the outside world by being raised on a terrace; the transition from the secular toward the sacred core goes not only inward but upward as well. This pattern might seem logical enough, but is in fact unusual; the usual charac- teristic of sacred precincts is that the outermost boundary is distinguished from the secular world of normality either by a zone of tabooed territory or by a wall, or both. Where there is a wall there must be a gate. And this gateway is always relatively elaborate. Quite often it is the most elaborate feature of the entire architectural complex. Now this is surely rather odd. The erotic scenes which cover the outside surface of the temple buildings at Khajuraho and which are now the principal attraction of such places for European and American tourists, are not immediately visible until you focus your attention</page><page sequence="8">250 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH rather carefully. The immediate impact of the sculptured imagery from the observer's point of view is a jumble. And that is the very essence of what I am saying: the jumble is the message. Even when you bring the imagery into focus this is still the case. You should not imagine that this is a peculiarity of Indian architectural style. The same is true of the greatest masterpieces of European medieval church architec- ture; in every one the jumble is the message. The art historian is of course taught just the opposite. The inner porch at Vezelay is hardly ever shown as in Figure 4. The photographers always pick out the central figure of the Christ and show it as in Figure 5. Absolutely superb of course, but that is not what the designers intended. Let me repeat again, the jumble is the message. Figure 4. Inner portico, Vizelay Figure 5. Christ figure from inner portico, VWzelay Similarly, erotic scenes such as Figure 6 are certainly found in profusion at Khajuraho, but you need to appreciate that they can only be recognized if you look rather hard. They do not have the kind of prominence which the picture books suggest. In context they look quite different. What is really characteristic of such imagery is the jumble: ladies adorning themselves, deities and princes at their devo- tions, naked women, couples in sexual embrace, a dancer taking a thorn from her</page><page sequence="9">GATEKEEPERS OF HEAVEN 251 foot, a serpent goddess (nagini) with cobras providing her halo, a confusion of the natural and the supernatural. I i Figure 6. Group of figures. Ka.ndariyi Mahideva Temple, Khajuraho Just what is going on in the enormously complicated scenes shown in Figure 7 would be very hard to say, but two unobvious points about the design emerge only from the context. First, it is located on the inner wall of the ambulatory immediately surrounding the innermost shrine of this particular complex, and the space is so small that the devotee will almost rub up against the figures. Second, it would ordinarily be invisible except by the light of a flickering oil lamp. The visible imagery that you see here was never intended; it is the product of modem technology in the form of a photoflash! THE GATEKEEPERS OF HEAVEN Where does all this fit in with my title? Heaven (or hell for that matter) is a negative concept. It is metaphysical and other, the counterpart of the physical here and now. Shrines and temples, however they may be constructed, are "in reality" physical objects within the confines of this world, but they are also "the house of God"; they belong both to this world and to the other world-they are gateways to heaven (or to hell). And equally, of course, the gateways into temples are gateways into gateways, thresholds of thresholds. Artists, architects, poets, mythographers the world over thus have this common problem: How do we best symbolize this notion of the threshold between the "here and the now" and "the other"?</page><page sequence="10">252 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Figure 7. Leogryphs and female figure on the Antarabhitti (internal wall) of the Garbhagriha, Vishvanatha Temple, Khajuraho The true representation of the Other, the Absolute Other, Deity as such, is logically impossible, for representation must be in terms of things of this world, and deity, by definition, is not made of the stuff of this world. Consequently all attempts to represent deity in material form may be considered sacrilegious. This is the case in Islam and in iconoclastic forms of Christianity, and also in early Buddhism. But deity can then be given an immaterial spatial representation, and this has great aesthetic merit, since empty space cannot be distorted by being removed from its context. You cannot put empty space into a museum exhibition of the "World of Islam," but the empty spaces of a mosque are, for all their emptiness, "works of art." The inverse, but nevertheless closely related approach to a representation of the Absolute is to have shrines which contain no internal space at all, but are simply solid objects of abstract shape which can be walked around. Buddhist dagobas, (from dhathu garbha, "womb of the relic") often gigantic in size, are constructed in solid brickwork on top of miniscule relic caskets.</page><page sequence="11">GATEKEEPERS OF HEAVEN 253 One very early Buddhist representation at Ajanta is simply a series of symbolic shapes cut from the solid rock. You can walk round it but not through it. This is the case also with the rather similar geometrical-cum-naturalistic forms which are combined in a lingam from Angkor (Figure 8), of which Coedes (1963:37) has remarked: The cult of the god-king whose 'royal essence' was supposed to reside in a linga esconced in a pyramid in the exact centre of the royal city was first introduced in the 9th Century. Later with the introduction of Buddhism, the god-king became an image of the king as Buddha. Several general themes deserve attention here. Because deity is nonmaterial there is a tendency (at least in the more intellectualizing religions) to "represent" deity either as empty space or as a combination of abstract geometrical shapes. In addition, because one major function of deity is creation, there is a worldwide tendency to represent deity by sexual imagery. The Christian crucifix in its protes- tant form and the modernized form of the Hindu lingam-yoni are both completely geometrical and depersonalized, but both have phallic origins. But the practical iconographic problem is not really how to represent absolute deity in material form, for that clearly is logically impossible. The question is rather how best to represent the mediators, the mystical entities which are betwixt and between, neither altogether divine nor altogether human, but god and man at the same time, the gatekeepers of heaven, the guardians of the threshold. I have already given the answer-the jumble is the message. The betwixt and between is represented by the union and transposition of opposites as in the Christian calvary, where saint and sinner merge with god/man. In many Hindu and Buddhist transpositions, the relevant imagery, or the relevant shrine, will be found outside the shrine or throne room of a higher being. No doubt there is in each case a myth, perhaps a variety of myths, which will explain why the imagery should take this particular form, though whether the imagery derives from the myth or the myth from the imagery I would not care to say. The image in Figure 9 is that of Vishnu in his avatar form of Narasingha, half- lion/half-man, destroying the demon king (Hiranyakasipu). You do not encounter such images in the main shrine of a temple, but only in subsidiary shrines somewhere between the outside and the central core. According to a well-known myth, the demon king, originally an ordinary mortal, through the power of his ascetic tapas forced Brahma to grant whatever he wished, short of immortality. He thus forced Brahma to ordain that he should not die of disease or of a weapon, of attack by man or by animal, on the ground or in the air, by day or by night, within the house or outside the house, and so on, or words to that effect. Hiranyakasipu, now an invulnerable demon king, proceeded to persecute humanity. The humans complained to the gods and Vishnu manifested himself as Narasingha, who was neither man nor animal. Narasingha eventually destroyed the demon king at dusk (which is neither day nor night), at a threshold (which is neither inside nor outside), by laying his victim on his lap (which is neither on the ground nor in the air), by tearing out his entrails with his claws (which is neither by disease nor by wounding with a weapon). I claimed earlier on that my theme was general rather than particular, so you may well be irritated by the fact that I have been concentrating upon a rather narrow range of Hindu mythology and symbolism. All the same I claim that there is a general aspect to my argument, in fact several such aspects. The first point is</page><page sequence="12">254 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH * A ....... ls "Al Figure 8. Mukhalinga, National Museum, Phnom Penh (by permission, from G.

Gamjam, Mukhalingeshvara Temple. ca. 800 A.D.</page><page sequence="14">256 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH simply architectural. If temples are a representation of the cosmos, as I think they always are (in a certain sense), I would also hold that all buildings are, from a psychological point of view, projections of the human body. This is a straight Freudian thesis, but it is also borne out by a good deal of recent ethnographic research. There is a homology between the culturally determined perception of the body (which gives high status to the mouth and low status to the anus) and the culturally determined perception of domestic buildings (by which honored guests are received at the front door and rubbish is thrown out at the back). If you do not accept such equations as almost obvious, then you need to ask yourself why architects and their clients devote such a disproportionate amount of their available resources to the construction of elaborate porticos. This is a universal phenomenon. I do not refer here simply to grandiose examples such as the entrances to ancient fortified cities and medieval castles, which at least up to a point had some military functional significance. Nor am I referring to the successive courtyards leading to the inner sanctum of an oriental temple, or to the west front of a Gothic cathedral, but also to the front entrance of almost any dwelling house anywhere. I spent a good deal of my childhood in the Lancashire town of Rochdale, a drab creation of the Industrial Revolution. Most of the inhabitants lived in back-to-back barracks-like terraced houses, heavily encrusted with soot, every dwelling seemingly like every other. But even here the need to embellish the entrance broke through. At least once a week the stone step outside the front door of each individual dwelling was scrubbed and scrubbed to a shining whiteness. Why? In the earlier part of this paper I was using examples from religious buildings, constructions which we almost automatically classify as shrines or temples. But I would remind you that the late Lord Raglan, in an undervalued book, claimed that there is a close homology between ordinary dwelling houses and temples, between the focal shrine of a temple and the marriage bed of a house. I would not want to put the argument quite in the way that either Raglan or his friend Hocart put it, but I would go along quite a lot of the way. The essence of the matter is that gateways get exaggerated architectural and aesthetic treatment because they are felt to be sacred. They are felt to be sacred because they are, in a quite fundamental sense, intrinsically ambiguous. They are neither on the inside nor on the outside. In crossing boundaries we break down the classifications by which order is established; at the boundary, male becomes female, clean becomes dirty, material becomes immaterial, nature becomes culture, animality becomes humanity, humanity becomes divinity. This essentially is why I hold that objects which we rate as works of art need always to be considered in context. Works of art are not just things in themselves, they are objects carrying moral implications. What the moral implication is depends upon where they are. By the time an object reaches an art gallery or a museum, it has acquired the special valuation that derives from such an environment and has correspondingly lost whatever moral valuation it possessed in the context for which it was created. There is very little that ordinary people can do about that, but anthropologists need to be especially on their guard. When we try to understand other cultures we</page><page sequence="15">GATEKEEPERS OF HEAVEN 257 must necessarily rely for the most part upon the monographs that other anthropolo- gists have written, on the photographs with which they illustrate their descriptions, and on the ethnographic souvenirs which they bring back from the field. In all such cases, change of context implies change of object. Or to put it differently, when we remove an object or even the description of an object from the set of other objects with which it was originally associated, we change its very nature. I shall try to illustrate what I have been saying by citing the case of the Hindu deity Ganesha, the elephant-headed son of Shiva. But first let me elaborate my body-building homology. Most buildings have windows for eyes, a front door for mouth, a back door for anus. But the human body has a more complex set of orifice openings onto the external world; the genitals, nose, and ears have no obvious counterparts in the simpler forms of architecture. In practice, for psychological reasons which Freudians are eager to explain but which here had best be taken as read, the body model is greatly simplified before it is "transformed" into material and architectural imagery. In the religious art of a vast variety of cultures the world over, the following equations tend to hold good: 1) The top half of the body is treated as homologous to the bottom half; 2) The orifices of the mouth and the nose then become the orifices of anus and penis; 3) Nose = penis. Consider, for example, the mask in Figure 10, which comes from the Sepik River in New Guinea and which was collected by Gregory Bateson. He tells us that the mask was worn by boy initiates at puberty, in a dramatic performance in which they impersonated their semidivine ancestors. The face is expressly designed to be both man-like and pig-like. The nose, which is explicitly phallic, is tipped with what is said to be a representation of a totemic creature, the sago weevil, which is credited with the powers of spontaneous generation. Altogether a highly condensed concen- tration of boundary-layer sacred metaphors. But let me return to Ganesha, another ambiguous deity with a long nose. I must cut out most of the mythology, but where Shiva is God the Father, Ganesha is God the Son and, like God the Son of Christianity, he is quite explicitly a mediator. He is the guardian of thresholds, not only spatially in that he stands at the front entrance, but in that he is addressed at the beginning of any enterprise. Under the title "Ganapati" he is certainly the most popular general deity in ordinary Hinduism. Hinduism conceives of deity as a kind of dialectical balance between latent potency (symbolized as male) and active potency (symbolized as female). Active potency has three main facets-creation, preservation, destruction. While the totality of deity is often represented iconographically by a male, many-armed figure with a female consort at his side, the combination of latent and active potency can also be shown by contrasting the violent activity of a male dancer with the passive stance of a yogi in meditation. Such a combination is the equivalent of the hermaphrodite figure of a male deity, which is likewise very common. Still another way of associating the passive latent potency of god with mundane reality is to give deity an animal associate. In fact every named aspect of deity in orthodox Hinduism has a distinctive animal as a vehicle on which he is shown as sitting or standing. The animal in question then becomes a symbol of the deity</page><page sequence="16">258 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Figure 10. Mask from Sepik River area, Papua New Guinea. Bateson Collection. University of Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology</page><page sequence="17">GATEKEEPERS OF HEAVEN 259 even when it is by itself "in the world." Thus the passive Shiva with his active consort Durga are often seen together riding a bull, Nandi. But Nandi by himself is the gatekeeper of a Shiva temple, and then stands outside in the world. Similarly Ganesha, the elephant-headed "son of Shiva," rides a rat (which to the European mind seems absurd); the rat, like Ganesha the guardian of thresholds, can find a way through all obstacles. Roughly speaking, where deity in Hindu iconography is given an explicitly anthropomorphic form and the deities are separate, they belong to the sphere of heaven. When deities are given explicitly animal form and are separate, they belong to the sphere of earth. But when the male/female/man/animal forms are confused, we are in the intermediate zone; we are then dealing with trickster characters corres- ponding to the Hermes of Greek mythology. The leogryph image which we have encountered already (Figures 3 and 7) is one such symbol of ambiguity. Ganesha is another. The proposition that "Ganesha's trunk is phallic" is not an invention of psycho- analysts, but an explicit element in the iconography (Figure 11). We can only "understand" the imagery involved, however, if we appreciate that the figure as a whole is the equivalent of an androgynous representation of Shiva. Likewise we cannot appreciate the full incongruence of representations of the ponderous dancing Ganesha unless we know that they are the equivalent of the elegant dancing Shiva Nataraja. Nor can we understand the image of Ganesha as an ascetic monk (Figure 12, which comes from Java), unless we know the story by which the active creative/ destructive aspect of Shiva is the counterpart of his inactive aspect. For example, in the story of Shiva and Parvati, Shiva is the ultimate ascetic, whose impregnable passivity in his yogic exercises is so powerful that the continued vitality of the cos- mos is brought under threat. So Parvati/Kali is created as the irresistibly seductive female, with the function of sapping the power of the immovable and unseductable Shiva. With a background awareness of theology such as this we are less surprised when we turn this Ganesha figure round and find he has become a demon destroyer, a truly ambivalent creation (Figure 13). This brings me to another generalizing proposition. Just as a knowledge of architectural and mythological context may help us to understand the meaning of objects, so also a knowledge of the meaning of objects may help us to understand mythology. In this paper I have been arguing that mediators stand in the middle-betwixt and between-which is hardly surprising. But I have also remarked that a sense of logic and order leads to discriminations. Verbal accounts of mythology, since they have to be understood as logical sequences, make clear-cut discriminations, whereas sculptured forms simply pile the metaphorical allusions one on top of the other. Levi-Strauss has established the point that in order to understand verbal expressions of myth we must take sets of myths and lay them one on top of another; contrariwise, in order to understand sculptural forms of myth we must to some extent take the metaphors to pieces, much as I have been doing. But unless you know the background this becomes a complicated business-the single image of Ganesha incorporates within itself whole volumes of cross-cutting mythological reference. Let us then tackle something rather simpler, for which most of us already possess at least part of the background.</page><page sequence="18">260 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Figure 11. Ganesha and Shakti. (by permission, from D. Desai, 1975, Erotic Sculpture of India, 92) The gatekeeper of heaven in Christian mythology is St. Peter, whose earthly representative is the pope. Apart from the fact that he is frequently shown carrying a set of keys, there is nothing very startling about his iconographic representation. His ambiguous qualities as mediator seem to have been somehow erased from the pictorial record. This is not quite the case in the written record, however. St. Peter's birth name was Simon; his subsequent name, Cephas, is Aramaic for "rock," which in Greek becomes Petros (Peter). Hence Peter is "the rock on which I shall build my church." This suggests that Peter should be everything that is firm and reliable, a proper source of papal infallibility. In fact what we are told about Peter in the gospels and in Acts seems anything but rock-like. In the gospels he denies his asso- ciation with Jesus three times in quick succession. In Acts his performance is more creditable, but less human. Arrested by Herod and put into jail he walks out of his chains and through the prison walls by supernatural means. Even so the reader of the New Testament is left with the impression that Peter is an ordinary human being-much more human, for example, than the Virgin Mary. But in terms of my structuralist generalization, this is not really appropriate to a mediator who has the key role of heavenly gatekeeper. Somehow St. Peter ought to be much more of an ambiguous demigod than he is in fact reported to be. My explanation for this departure from theory is that Simon Peter now appears relatively unambiguous because, in terms of early Christian mythology, he was only one half of a dual figure, the other half of which was Simon Magus. Both in biblical story and Christian legend, the actual performances of these two Simons are almost identical, but where Peter is an ascetic saint who works miracles in the name of</page><page sequence="19">Figure 12.

Taken together they form a Janus-faced trickster. In later Christian tradition Simon Magus appears as the persistent opponent of Simon Peter. The Magus claims for himself all the wonders that are attributed to Christ-thus he claims to be Son of God, to die and be resurrected after three days, to be able to ascend up to heaven, and so on. But Peter, although human, is able to call upon the power of the Holy Ghost to show that Simon Magus achieves his miracles only through trickery. The end of the story is that Peter and Simon Magus have a contest before Nero. Simon claims that he will show his powers by ascending to heaven. I quote from a translation of the Acts of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul (see Palmer and More 1936:33ff.): Then Simon went up upon the tower in the face of all, and crowned with laurels, he stretched forth his hands, and began to fly. And when Nero saw him flying, he said to Peter: This Simon is true; but thou and Paul are deceivers. To whom Peter said: Immediately shalt thou know that we are true disciples of Christ; but that he is not Christ, but a magician, and a malefactor. Nero said: Do you still persist? Behold, you see him going up into heaven ... and Peter, look- ing steadfastly against Simon, said: I adjure you, ye angels of Satan, who are carrying him into the air, to deceive the hearts of the unbelievers, by the God that created all things, and by Jesus Christ, whom on the third day He raised from the dead, no longer from this hour to keep him up, but to let him go. And immediately, being let go, he fell into a place called Sacra Via, that is, Holy Way, and was divided into four parts, having perished by an evil fate. In Figure 14, a Renaissance representation of this scene, Nero is on the left, Peter and Paul on the right. Simon Magus takes off from a platform at the back center and crashes in center foreground. The artist has put the flight path of the would-be semidivine Magus down the center, across the threshold of Nero's throne. Peter and Paul stand firmly among the commoner human beings, but their halos distinguish them from the rest. The flying Magus and the standing Peter are identically dressed, except that light replaces dark and dark light. No one else in the picture wears his costume in quite this way. My point is simply this. The iconography of twelfth-century Hinduism is not quite so remote from our normal interests as most of us may think. I have been trying to show that even though we can look at Hindu pictorial and sculptural images by themselves and enjoy them as works of art, we still need to put them back into context if we are to get any feel of their religious significance. And in the same way we can (up to a point) learn to appreciate the masterpieces of European painting and architecture simply as pure works of art. But our Western culture has its roots in the mythology of Christendom, just as Indian culture has its roots in the mythology of Hinduism. So if, as Christians, any of you really want to understand what is said about St. Peter in the New Testament, and why he should hold the keys of heaven, you need to put him back into context and see what was said about his counterpart Simon Magus in the literature of early Christianity. Taken together the two Simons have some very Ganesha-like characteristics. Heavenly gatekeepers have much in common the world over; invariably they turn out to be double-faced tricksters like the chameleon who played that role among the Kachins of North Burma, among whom I once learned the elements of social anthropology. * The Harvey Distinguished Visiting Lecture Series was made possible by a grant from Byron Harvey, III, to the Department of Anthropology, University of New Mexico.</page><page sequence="21">Figure 14.
