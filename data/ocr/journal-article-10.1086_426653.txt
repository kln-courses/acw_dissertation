The friar has resumed an intense rhythm of  intellec- tual production, which, along with his heroic efforts as a preacher, would transform him into one of  the pillars of  the seraphic utopia in Nueva España. In 1547, he finishes his Arte para aprender la lengua mexicana, the first grammar to deal with Nahuatl. At the beginning of  1552, he finishes his Siete sermones principales sobre los siete pecados capi- tales. And in 1553, he writes in Nahuatl his Tratado he hechicerías y sortilegios.1 This Tratado de hechicerías is a special work for two reasons. First, it is considered the first text written in Mexico devoted strictly to the issue of  demonology.2 Second, instead of  creating an original treatise, Olmos devoted himself  to translating and adapting a manual published in Spain I would like to record my profound debt to José Emilio Burucúa for his inspiration in the early days of  my research projects. 1 Georges Baudot, Utopía e historia en México: Los primeros cronistas de la civilización mexicana (1520–1569) (Madrid: Espasa-Calpe, 1983), pp. 146–50. 2 Fernando Cervantes, The Devil in the New World: The Impact of Diabolism in New Spain (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1994), p. 25. ç 2004 by The University of  Chicago.

The authors of  catechisms, confessors’ manuals, and homiletic collections could seldom find European works suitable for providing an explicit matrix for their American manuals. The uncompromising novelty of  the continent demanded original creations.4 Therefore, the effort carried out by Olmos provides the historian with the rare privilege to observe, in an almost experimental way, the tensions to which the European discourses were subjected by the American reality: the alterations they needed, the concessions they required, or the omis- sions they demanded. The two works have never been compared in a systematic and exhaus- tive way.5 In fact, in the few cases in which they are considered together, specialists tend to believe that Olmos’s treatise follows Castañega’s original without substantial changes.6 However, the comparative analysis of  both texts demonstrates the opposite thesis: in his effort to adapt and translate, Olmos introduced profound alterations in the original text. His Tratado de hechicerías is a radically new work. Upon reading his Span- ish source, it becomes clear that fray Andrés developed his own discourse, which strikingly diverges from the radical European demonology that at first seemed to have inspired him. ii. fray martín, fray andrés Fray Martín de Castañega is definitely a mysterious person. His name would have been forgotten but for his Tratado de las supersticiones y hechizerias, whose title page and preface provide most of  his known bio- graphical facts. Strangely enough, none of  the histories edited by the Franciscan order in the sixteenth and seventeenth century provide data about him. Fray Pedro de Salazar, who in 1612 in Madrid published Coronica y historia de la fundación y progreso de la provincia de Castilla de la Orden de San Francisco, does not mention Castañega at all.7 3 The complete title as it appears on the title page is Tratado muy sotil y bien fundodo d[e] las supersticiones y hechizerias y vanos conjuros y abusiones: Y otras cosas al casp to- ca[n]tes y de la possibilidad y remedio dellas. 4 Martine Azoulai, Les péchés du Nouveau Monde: Les manuels pour la confession des Indiens, XVIe–XVIIe siècle (Paris: Albin Michel, 1993), p. 43. 5 The exception is Daniel Mosquera, who limits his comparison to the discursive and rhe- torical aspects of  both texts.

In 1516, he was released by Leo X from an inquisitorial prison where he had been confined because of  his public defense of  a member of  the order condemned by the Holy Office. In 1531, Castañega appeared as guardián of  the Convento de Santa María de Jesús, in Navarrete; twenty-four years later, we find him as guardián of  the monastery of  Aránzazu, in Guipúzcoa.8 Most of  Castañega’s fame results from the publication of  his manual one year before Pedro Ciruelo’s Reprobacion de las supersticiones y hechizerias (Alcalá de Henares, 1530), the most famous treatise of  the Spanish literature of  superstition.9 This circumstance suffices to cause modern scholars always to quote both works together. However, the for- tune of  both tratados de las supersticiones was quite different: while the Reprobacion by Ciruelo had a remarkable editorial success, the Tratado by Castañega was not reprinted until the middle of  the twentieth cen- tury.10 Whereas at present there are many samples of  Ciruelo’s work, Castañega’s book is considered by Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo to be “extremely rare.”11 Martín de Castañega’s treatise was commissioned by don Alonso de Castilla, bishop of  Calahorra y la Calzada, who paid for the edition out of  his own pocket. In the Provisión, at the beginning of  the book, the prel- ate described the Franciscan as a “theologian and philosopher of  great subtlety, and a preacher of  the Holy Office assigned by His Majesty.”12 In his inquisitorial position, Castañega must have been involved in the witch- craft enquiries that affected Navarra and the Basque Country between 1525 and 1527. In his book, Castañega assigns himself  the role of  eye- witness to the events. There is no doubt that the Tratado de las super- sticiones has a direct relationship with these early persecutions in the farthest north of  the country. The events were mostly confined to the pro- ceedings initiated by the licenciado Balanza, magistrate of  the Consejo 8 For biographical information on Castañega, see Tratado de las supersticiones y he- chicerías de Fray Martín de Castañega, ed.

This witch hunt may have produced at least fifty exe- cutions and can be considered the major prosecution prior to the well- known events of  Zugarramurdi.13 The novelty of  the crimes attributed to witches produced perplexity among Spanish inquisitors and theologians. One of  the consequences of  these northern trials was the meeting of  a junta de notables in Granada to advise the Consejo Supremo de la Inquisición about the reality of  the events attributed to the bruxas, especially the nocturnal flight.14 As we will see later, these witchcraft prosecutions are the only possible contact in the biographies of  our two Franciscans. Paradoxically, Fray Andrés de Olmos, polyglot and an outstanding lin- guist, is a better-known figure. Fray Jerónimo de Mendieta points out his importance as a chronicler, when he describes him as “the fountain from which all streams on this matter flow.”15 Olmos must have been born near Oña, not far from Burgos, around 1480. He joined the Franciscan order in Valladolid. In 1527, Fray Juan de Zumárraga—future first bishop of Mexico—chose him as his assistant during a witchcraft inquiry in Vis- caya.16 As a consequence, Castañega and Olmos found themselves in- volved in the same northern witch hunt, in Navarra and in the Basque Country, respectively. This coincidence has led to the speculation of  a possible encounter between the friars.17 This meeting that could explain why Olmos chose Castañega’s Tratado—a minor text, practically ignored by the theologians of  the time—as the source of  inspiration for his own book.18 However, this supposed meeting has never been actually con- firmed. Nevertheless, Fray Andrés’s career in Castle would be brief: when Zumárraga moved to New Spain, he took Olmos with him. On De- cember 6, 1528, the Franciscan arrived in Mexico-Tenochtitlán. In his re- maining forty years he never returned to Spain. 13 See Florencio Idoate, La Brujería aen Navarra y sus documentos (Pamplona: Insti- tución Príncipe de Viana, 1978), pp. 23–59; William Monter, La otra Inquisición: La In- quisición en la Corona de Aragón, Navarra, el País Vasco y Sicilia (Barcelona: Crítica, 1992), pp. 306–10. 14 Henry Kamen, La Inquisición Española (Barcelona: Crítica, 1988), pp. 275–77; Iñaki Reguera, La Inquisición Española en el País Vasco (San Sebastián: Txertoa, 1983), pp. 197– 98; Henry Charles Lea, Historia de la Inquisición Española, 3 vols.

By 1553, Olmos was finishing a long period of  residence in Hueytlalpan. In the prologue of  the Tratado de hechicerías he acknowledged his weari- ness and contemplated death: “my end is near.”19 He could not have been more wrong. Between 1554 and 1568 he would carry out the titanic task of  evangelizing the inhospitable Huasteca. In spite of  his age he traveled through the whole region, where he made contact with chichimecan groups, some of  whose chiefs accepted baptism. When they raised up in arms in 1568, Olmos—at about ninety years of  age—demanded to be taken to the scene of  the rebellion, where he preached his message for the last time. Suffering asthma and dermatological illnesses, he died in Tampico on October 8 of  the same year.20 iii. separation, translation, and conversion We are going back now to the moment when the intellectual biographies of  Fray Martín and Fray Andrés meet, when Olmos chose Castañega’s forgotten Tratado de las supersticiones as the inspiration for his own Tra- tado de hechicerías. Olmos decided then to undertake a fascinating exer- cise of  translation between two unique and radically different civilizations. During the last three millennia b.c.e., religion appears to have func- tioned as an important promoter of  intercultural translatability. The civi- lizations from the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East compared deities beginning with the definition of  their cosmic manifestations. Theological onomasiology, which starts from the referent and asks for the correspon- dent word, displaced theological semasiology, which starts from the word and asks for its correspondent meaning. The first strategy tries to per- ceive the way in which a certain semantic unit is expressed in different languages, thus resulting in an intrinsically cross-cultural and interlinguis- tic project of  translation. Starting from the conviction that other peoples worshipped the same gods, religion constituted a foundation for toler- ance, a neutralizing principle of  the effects of  the “pseudo-speciation,” a term coined to describe the formation of  artificial subgroups within the same biological species.21 19 The quotations I reproduce in notes are taken from Baudot’s Spanish version of  the original Nahuatl text.

In these contexts, much like an immune reaction, a deliberate counter-identity is generated to oppose the dominant system, a process that may be charac- terized as second-degree or counter-distinctive pseudo-speciation. It is under these typical conditions of  resistance that religions of  a new kind appear, religions which defy the efforts of  translation, which can only be joined through conversion, and which are abandoned through apostasy. Judaism is the paradigmatic model for religions of  second degree.22 The most clear sign that we are in presence of  a second-degree religion is the phenomenon of  conversion. As long as the possibility of  intercultural translation exists, there will be no need for conversion. A demand of  this kind will only arise when a certain religion claims the monopoly of  the supreme truth, nullifying any possibility of  translation. Cosmotheistic deities, so long as they embody the universe in its totality, possess names with rich signifiers. On the contrary, the God of  Israel represents the oppo- site extreme. When He says “I am who I am,” he denies any external ref- erent, every tertius comparationis, and thus any possibility of  translation.23 These rhetorical strategies of  nondialogue reveal that the capacity of communication with the other not only reflects the linguistic dimensions of  different paradigms but also the conscious strategies of  the partici- pants in the dialogue.24 The translation strategies of  Christian preachers in the New World could not escape from these conscious limitations. The incommensurability willingly constructed by Christianity and its agents made impossible the complete translation of  the conquerors’ culture into that of  the dominated people. But it did not prevent preachers from learn- ing the languages of  the latter.25 Translation then became the most appro- 22 Ibid., p. 29. 23 Ibid., p. 32. 24 Mario Biagioli, Galileo Courtier: The Practice of Science in the Culture of Absolutism (Chicago: University of  Chicago Press, 1994), pp. 215–16. 25 In its most enlightened periods, the Church had the conviction that the best way to per- suade the Jews of  their mistake was to master their language and sacred books. Transcending mere humanistic erudition, trilingual colleges were founded with the evangelic purpose of providing the necessary techniques to preach Christianity in a more efficient way (Colin P. Thompson, La lucha de las lenguas: Fray Luis de León y el siglo de oro en España [Sala- manca: Junta de Castilla y León, 1995], p. 148). In America, the Franciscans fanatically de- fended the preaching of  Christianity in the local languages, trying to show themselves as apostles of  an autonomous religion rather than agents of  a colonial power. Of  109 works written in indigenous languages in America during the sixteenth century, minor friars wrote eighty. The first generations of  Franciscans spread Nahuatl even in places in which it was not spoken. In fact, the friars were responsible for the survival of  classical Nahuatl, which the natives did not use. But mendicant preachers also used many other languages. In the specific case of  catechisms, we can find texts in Tarascan, Zapotecan, Otomí, Guastecan, Guatemal- tecan, Chichimecan, Chontal, Mixtecan, Tzotzil, Quichua, Aymará, and Timucuan, among many others (Luis Resines Llorente, Catecismos Americanos del siglo XVI [Salamanca: Junta de Castilla y León, 1992], p. 33). </page> <page sequence="7"> History of Religions 7 priate tool to absorb the colonial difference previously established by the conquest itself.26 With regard to the translation of  Christian cosmology into native lan- guages, preachers had to adopt one of  two possible strategies. They could keep European words without translating them, preserving theological accuracy but risking a lower level of  comprehension, fixing Christian notions in the indigenous mind as something perpetually strange. Alter- natively, they could attempt the translation of  some words, looking for equivalences in the native languages or expressing the notions through paraphrasing, at the risk of  Amerindian words retaining part of  their an- cient pre-Christian meaning.27 The Franciscans chose a halfway path. For the deity and those terms associated with his image, they resorted to a strategy close to that of theological semasiology, blocking any possible translation, as in a typi- cal second-degree religion. For God’s opponent, Satan, they resorted to theological onomasiology, matching the pagan gods with the evil spirits, using Amerindian terms to describe the devil and his actions. This double strategy, which postulated simultaneously commensurability and incom- mensurability between both rival cosmologies, exemplifies how the devil’s symbolism served to bridge the gulf  between European and Amerindian cultures in New Spain.28 But the unyielding opposition between God and Satan in Christian cosmology generated a destructive conclusion for lo- cal religions: if  the gods of  one were the devils of  the other, the trans- latability of  the meanings of  the indigenous world would not generate an identification with the other, but rather a violent desire to destroy every expression of  paganism in America, the last terrestrial bulwark of  Luci- fer. The native spirits were thus incorporated into the événement sans fin of  Christian cosmology, turned into an aspect of  the prehistory of  Chris- tianity.29 God was the great absentee in the indigenous past, and the devil its exclusive protagonist. Although consistent with the political objectives of  material and spiri- tual colonization of  the New World, this twofold strategy produced un- expected results. The specific meaning of  any of  the terms within a total structure is dependent on the total set of  relationships; it is not a result of their meaning as isolates, disconnected from other isolates. Things are 26 Walter Mignolo, Local Histories/Global Designs: Coloniality, Subaltern Knowledges and Border Thinking (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2000), p. 3. 27 Robert Ricard, La conquista espiritual de México: Ensayo sobre el apostolado y los métodos misioneros de las órdenes mendicantes en la Nueva España de 1523–24 a 1572 (México: Editorial JUS, 1947), p. 144; Resines Llorente, p. 33. 28 Mosquera (n. 5 above), p. 9. 29 I use this notion of  événement sans fin in the sense used by Alain Boureau in L’événe- ment sans fin: Récit et christianisme au Moyen Âge (Paris: Belles Lettres, 1993). </page> <page sequence="8"> 8 Witches, Idolaters, Franciscans relationships, and these relationships are ontological rather than logical.30 Thus, what we mean by “swan” depends on what we mean by “duck.” How can we translate our “swan” into a language of  a culture whose uni- verse does not contain ducks?31 The center of  gravity and the total design of  a culture may give a society a distinctiveness, a uniqueness as a spe- cial crystallization of  components.32 This is why the evangelizers’ conceit that a common denominator had been found in the concept of  the devil allowed a paradoxical proximity between the two cultural universes to develop, inevitably producing serious categorical errors. The Nahuas and the Spanish were able to operate for centuries based on false but functional presumptions, pretending that analogous concepts from the other culture were essentially identical to their own, a phenom- enon that allowed the preservation of  the indigenous structures for a long period of  time. These multiple distortions are better perceived if  we take into consideration the essential irreducibility that characterizes both cos- mologies: Christian duality and Nahua monism. In the indigenous cosmos, order and chaos were complementary aspects of  a singular reality. The notion of  a totally good god was an absurdity in mesoamerican thought. Such a being would have lacked the essential power to disrupt in order to create. Likewise, a totally evil spirit would have lacked the power to create, which in turn would enable it to disrupt.33 But the Franciscans subsumed the oppositions that expressed a monist cosmogonical image (center-periphery, purity-pollution, health-illness, or abstinence-excess) in order to use them to reflect their own binary oppositions.34 The mis- sionaries also tried to introduce the notion of  Trinity, a concept based on a phenomenal paradox, in cultures that completely lacked such a logical category. They even wrote supposed Amerindian grammars that, because they were made to conform to the model of  classical grammars, precluded the missionaries from recognizing that in many local languages abstrac- tions had a verbal rather than a nominal form.35 They thought that the Christian hell could be assimilated to the nahua mictlan, without realiz- ing that this was a cold northern place where every individual would go after death anyway.36 In this subjugation of  content to form, it is clear 30 Michael T.

In the new Spanish scenario, the logical structure of  the universe remained Nahua, and the Christian elements were transformed to function within it.37 When in 1553 Fray Andrés de Olmos decided to base his Tratado de hechicerías on Castañega’s own Tratado de las supersticiones, he was ready to begin an impossible task, an adventure that was in itself  an oxy- moron: the translation of  a pair of  opposites, God and Satan, the first one irreducible to any previous Amerindian experience, and the second one with clear analogies between himself  and the deities of  the nahua cosmology. iv. a new title, a new structure, and a new treatise It is inaccurate to claim that Olmos’s work simply plagiarized Casta- ñega’s Tratado.38 The mere formal alterations with respect to the Tratado de las supersticiones, leaving aside the substantial theological differences or the translation into Nahuatl itself, transform Fray Martín’s manual into a radical new text. In the next section, I will try to show the intrinsic re- lations between formal changes and changes in content, but first I will outline the formal alterations introduced by the American preacher into Castañega’s original. a) In the first place, there is a very important fact: the change in title. Castañega’s Tratado de las supersticiones y hechizerias becomes Ol- mos’s Tratado de hechicerías y sortilegios. b) Second, Olmos makes a suggestive cut from Castañega’s original. Out of  the twenty-four chapters of  the Tratado de las supersticiones, Fray Andrés only keeps the first eleven. Far from signifying a simple recognition of  the irrelevance of  the description of  the European superstitions for the new American conversos, this mutilation is part of  a conscious strategy that destroys the original sense of  Casta- ñega’s treatise. c) Between chapters 2 and 3 of  his Tratado de hechicerías, Olmos inter- polates the only completely new chapter, which is absent from Cas- tañega’s Tratado. Curiously enough, Fray Andrés avoids enumerating correlatively the interpolated chapter, which has then no number. d ) The prologue from the original is replaced by a new one, the only fragment in Olmos’s treatise wholly written in Spanish. 37 Burkhart, p. 235; James Lockhart, “Sightings: Initial Nahua Reactions to Spanish Cul- ture,” in Implicit Understandings: Observing, Reporting and Reflecting on the Encounters between European and Other Peoples in the Early Modern Era, ed.

The totality of  these formal changes transforms the Tratado de hechi- cerías into something more than a lineal adaptation of  the Tratado de las supersticiones. Olmos constructs an original work, whose radical alter- ations I will analyze in the following section. v. from superstition to idolatry: the subject of  discourse The subjects of  Castañega’s and Olmos’s particular discourses radically differ from each other. The difference transcends the originality of  the spatial and temporal contexts as well as the simple divergence between the superstitions of  the European peasantry and the idolatry of  American Indians. Both Franciscans attempted the construction of  complex fictional narrations and the creation of  imaginary identities functional to the groups they represented: the high theological culture, on the one hand, and the missionary Franciscan enterprise, on the other. Castañega and Olmos exemplify in this way a central aspect of  the Renaissance ethos, the in- creasing self-consciousness about the fashioning of  human identity as a manipulable process.39 Fray Martín’s and Fray Andrés’s treatises can be considered as clear expressions of  symbolic power par excellence, that is, the capacity to create groups, both existent groups that have to be con- secrated and nonexistent groups that have to be established.40 To accom- plish this, both friars possessed the necessary symbolic capital to impose on other spirits a vision of  social divisions derived from the social author- ity acquired in previous struggles, and from the support of  established institutions (the Holy Office, the Spanish episcopate, and the mendicant orders). Neither of  the Franciscans could escape the intrinsic logic that governs the functioning of  cultures, which seem unable to exist as self-sufficient entities. Cultures must juxtapose themselves against each other to ascer- tain what makes them unique and different.41 People know who they are 39 Eva Kushner, “The Emergence of  the Paradoxical Self,” in Imagining Culture: Essays in Early Modern History and Literature, ed.

It is easier to love what we are if  we are in- duced to abhor what we are not.42 As a consequence of  this, borders and frontiers are not so much the limits, but the nucleus of  cultures, in the same way that the beach upholds the concept of  island.43 When a culture defines itself  as the center of  the world, it requires the periphery that sur- rounds it as part of  its own self-definition: it is the sum of  the interior and the exterior that constructs the whole identity, the totality outside of  which nothing exists.44 Thus, otherness is independent from any real knowledge of  others: if  they did not exist, then cultures would need to invent them.45 In this way, to displace identities is typical of  human cultures, replacing real origins with fictional ones.46 Martín de Castañega and Andrés de Ol- mos are a perfect example of  the process of  constructing fictional groups and opposed identities. castañega’s subject of discourse: superstitious men and the diocesan clergy Martín de Castañega organizes his discourse around two sets of  opposed identities, one of  them explicit and the other implicit. In regard to the first one, Fray Martín develops to an extreme the well-known image of the two churches, the Catholic against the counter-satanic church.47 Each chapter of  the Tratado is internally organized with this ontological oppo- sition. The counter-church includes, at the same time, those who have established explicit and implicit pacts with the devil. This second-degree opposition organizes the whole structure of  the book: the first eleven chapters describe those who have declared themselves to be worshippers of  the devil; the other thirteen chapters describe those who are part of  the diabolic church without even knowing it. In search of  a paradigmatic image to represent the counter-satanic church, Castañega resorts to the stereotype of  the witches’ Sabbath.

But is Castañega’s manual a demonological treatise similar to those composed by Jean Bodin, Henri Boguet, Pierre de Lancre, Heinrich Institoris, Martín Del Río, and Fran- cesco Maria Guazzo, which have the aim of  hunting witches and un- masking their diabolical conspiracy?49 The answer is certainly no. In the title itself, the Franciscan presents his book as a treatise of  reproba- ción de supersticiones. La Rioja and the bishopric of  Calahorra y la Calzada—consignee of  the Tratado—were never the scenario of  massive persecutions of  witches, not even when the trials in the neighboring re- gions multiplied in the middle of  the 1520s. Castañega served the Holy Office during the witchcraft prosecutions in Navarra and the Basque Country. Perhaps this explains why he resorted to the image of  the noc- turnal meetings of  the bruxas. Yet, there is also no doubt about the wor- ries of  the bishop Alonso de Castilla: his concern was the superstitions scattered all around his dioceses. The prelate and the friar’s true objec- tives were not the witches but the most banal superstitions that impreg- nated the everyday life of  the christianos viejos. Castañega’s Tratado is nothing but a didactic display of  the Augustin- ian model of  superstition.50 Superstitions are condemned since, as vain practices and beliefs, they cannot produce the effects they preach, par- ticularly from the perspective of  the two orders of  legitimate causalities in the traditional Christian cosmos: the natural and supernatural orders. When the homo superstitious practiced vain rituals, who were expected to produce the desired effects if  these could not be produced through natural forces, and if  those practices were not instituted by God or the Church?They must appeal to a third order of  causalities that, although il- legitimate, was capable of  producing real effects: the preternatural order, 48 See David Frankfurter, “Ritual as Accusation and Atrocity: Satanic Ritual Abuse, Gnostic Libertinism, and Primal Murders,” History of Religions 40 (2001): 353, 355, 363. 49 For a synthesis of  the traditional demonological positions, see Sidney Anglo, ed., The Damned Art: Essays in the Literature of Witchcraft (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1977); Sophie Houdard, Les sciences du diable: Quatre discours sur la sorcellerie (Paris: Cerf, 1992); Martine Ostorero, Agostino Paravicini Bagliani, and Kathrin Utz Tremp, eds., L’imaginaire du sabbat: Édition critique des textes les plus anciens (1430 c.–1440 c.)

The mise-en-scène of  any superstitious practice—the words, the gestures, the materials, and the numerical patterns involved—should then be consid- ered conventional signs or an established pact between those evil spirits and the homines superstitiosi.52 As a matter of  fact, vain practices were not based on a system of causes but on a system of  signs, possessing not a causal but a semantic function. For this reason, within the framework of  this Christian model of  superstition—unlike other earlier and later ones—it was expected that practices that are intrinsically vanae could indeed produce real effects. These are not achieved through natural or supernatural virtue but through the actions of  the devil, who quickly responds to produce effects stipu- lated beforehand whenever he observes the agreed-upon signs (the images and characters used in the vain rituals). Thomas Aquinas improved the model when he developed the notion of  the implicit pact, by means of which the performance of  any vain ritual always opened a door to the devil’s intervention, even when the practitioner did not conjure its pres- ence, did not sign pacts, or did not take part in sacrilegious nocturnal assemblies.53 Martín de Castañega reproduced this Christian model of  superstition in his Tratado. The title itself  induces us to consider that it is not the first eleven chapters, but the latter thirteen, that constitute the core of  the work. These describe the practices and beliefs that actually existed in Span- ish territory: saludadores (healer of  rabies), mal de ojo (evil eye), nóminas (written spells), ensalmos (oral spells), excomulgadores de langostas (ex- communication of  locusts), conjuros de tormentas (cloud conjuring), and so on.54 When Castañega interposes the first eleven chapters—that de- scribe the counter-church, under the specific form of  the Sabbath—with the remaining thirteen—that describe the actually existent vain practices— he tries to strengthen the Augustinian-Thomist idea that between the former and the latter there is not a qualitative difference, but only one of  degree. The members of  the diabolical church are those who worship the devil 51 See Fabián Alejandro Campagne, “Witchcraft and the Sense of  the Impossible in Early Modern Spain,” Harvard Theological Review 96 (2003): 33–39. 52 Saint Augustine, De doctrina christiana II, 20, 30–31; II, 24, 36; II, 25, 37; and II, 29, 45. 53 Campagne, Homo Catholicus, pp. 69–72. 54 For a brief  description of  these practices, see Juan Francisco Blanco, Brujería y otros oficios populares de la magia (Valladolid, Spain: Ámbito, 1992), pp. 105–30; 209–60; He- liodoro Cordente Martínez, Brujería y hechicería en el obispado de Cuenca (Cuenca; Dipu- tación Provincial, 1990), chaps. 8–17; María Tauasiet, Ponzoña en los ojos: Brujería y superstición en Aragón en el siglo XVI (Zaragoza: Institución Fernando el Católico, 2000), pp. 251–371. </page> <page sequence="14"> 14 Witches, Idolaters, Franciscans through explicit pacts, as well as those who facilitate his work in the world through tacit pacts. Superstition in this way becomes a litotes of the witches’ Sabbath, and this was precisely the feeling Castañega wanted to generate, a few years after the beginning of  the first important witch hunt in Spanish territory.55 The theologian tried to show the existence of a conductive thread among the superstitions, apparently simple and harm- less, and the hideous parodies of  the Sabbath, which was an extremely useful relationship to disqualify the former. Who, then, is the subject of  Castañega’s discourse? We find the in- tended audience of  the book in his second set of  implicit opposed iden- tities. As was very common in the literature of  superstition, Castañega builds a generic homo superstitiosus, which he identified with aged men, children, or women, images that evoke intellectual deficiencies. But from reading the bishop’s Provisión we can deduce the real homines supersti- tiosi to whom Castañega’s manual is addressed: the clergy of  the Cala- horra dioceses. The common priests were the first who should learn the subtleties of  the superstition matter before being able to eradicate the vain practices and observances from the people. The bishop and the author conceived the Tratado as an illustration for the parish priests, who were themselves as far from the ideal homo catholicus as the average parish- ioners. This is why the prelate warns “all the priests” and “all the eccle- siasts from this bishopric to have the aforementioned treatises . . . ; bearing in mind that if they do not possess them and read them, they will be liable to be guilty of superstition, and they will be severely punished.”56 Cas- tañega reinforced don Alonso de Castilla’s admonitions: “[this book] to my own understanding, is not only useful for the simpleminded to refrain them from making errors and falling for diabolical deceit, even more, it is necessary to do away with the ignorance of  many, that assuming them- selves as learned deny the ways of  the superstitions and sorceries, that are included, declared and persuaded here.”57 The high theological culture, represented in this case by an agent of the inquisitorial power and a bishop, presents itself  as the only holder of  the truth, the custodian of  the power to distinguish between orthopraxis and 55 See Fabián Alejandro Campagne, “El otro-entre-nosotros: Funcioanlidad de la noción de superstitio en el modelo hegemónico cristiano (España, siglos XVI y XVII),” Bulletin Hispanique 102 (2000): 52–53, 57. 56 Castañega (n. 10 above), p. 12: “mandamos a todos los curas, y rogamos y amonestamos a los otros eclesiásticos deste nuestro obispado, y a cada uno dellos, que todos tengan sendos de estos tratados . . . ; avisandolos que si por no lo tener y leer, en alguna culpa de super- stición cayeren, los mandaremos mas gravemente castigar” (my emphasis). 57 Ibid., p. 2: “[este libro] a mi ver, no solo aprovechara a los simples para apartarlos de sus errores y engaños diabolicos, mas aun es necesario para quitar muchas ignorancias de muchos, que, presumiendo de letrados, niegan las maneras de las supersticiones y hechize- rias, que aquí se ponen, declaran y persuaden.” </page> <page sequence="15"> History of Religions 15 heteropraxis, orthodoxia and heterodoxia. In opposition to the commu- nity of  the “mayores de pueblo de Dios,” to the theologos and holy doc- tors, Castañega’s discourse designs two subordinated sets of  “menores del pueblo de Dios”:58 in the first place, a generic homo superstitiosus, rhetorically identified with the ignorant common people; in the second place, a wider homo superstitiosus, made up of  the low clergy and other exponents of  the lay learned culture, who had to be the first to learn the superstition matter to avoid becoming homines superstitiosi themselves. This construction of  a double subject of  discourse runs through the total- ity of  the Spanish antisuperstitious literature, from the treatises of  Lope de Barrientos, in the mid-fifteenth century, to the great summae of  Benito Jerónimo Feijóo, in the eighteenth century.59 All of  them outline a wider audience for the antisuperstitious discourse that, depending on the case, can include the king, the secular magistrates, the jurists, the medicine doctors, and the natural philosophers. That is to say, the audience was the totality of  learned Spanish culture, which in ideal terms was supposed to be safe from the sin of  superstitio, but which was strictly subordinate to the community of  theologians whenever they had to distinguish the illicit practices from the licit.60 olmos’s subject of discourse: indians and idolaters Even if  he was inspired by Castañega’s work, the subject of  discourse in Andrés de Olmos is radically different. Fray Andrés does not interpolate the diocesan clergy, the true addressee of  Castañega’s teaching. In his Tratado de hechicerías Olmos leaves aside all intermediation: it is In- dians to whom he addresses his discourse in a direct way. Even though Andrés de Olmos was not one of  the twelve Franciscans sent in 1524 to evangelize the recently conquered New Spain—he arrived four years later with Zumárraga—his contribution to the seraphic utopia cannot be exaggerated. During his residence in Spanish monasteries, his identification with the ideals of  poverty turned him into an adherent of the Castilian branch of  the Franciscan observantia. In fact, his first Mex- ican mission consisted of  searching for Motolinía, the most outstanding of  the twelve, who was believed to have disappeared in Guatemala.61 Scholars do not find in Olmos’s work the fanatical millenarian expecta- tions that characterized the first generations of  Franciscans in the New 58 Both expressions belong to Pedro Ciruelo, Reprobación de las supersticiones y hechi- zerias: Libro muy util y necesario a todos los buenos christianos (Medina del Campo, 1551), fol. 31v. 59 Campagne, Homo Catholicus, pp. 295–322. 60 See Fabián Alejandro Campagne, “ ‘Porque no les acaesca condepnar los inocentes e absolver los reos’: La superstición como construcción ideológica en la España de los siglos XV al XVIII,” Cuadernos de Historia de España 75 (1998–99): 243–72. 61 Baudot, Utopía e historia (n. 1 above), p. 135. </page> <page sequence="16"> 16 Witches, Idolaters, Franciscans World. Nevertheless, his tireless work as an itinerant preacher as well as his enthusiasm for the ethnographic chronicles—in the case of  the Fran- ciscans, indissolubly linked to the preparation of  the millennium—clearly demonstrate his de facto adherence to the providential mission that the order had assigned to itself. The origin of  the Franciscan observance seems to go back to Giovanni della Valle, a disciple of  Angelo Clareno, who joined the order in 1325.62 In Spain, the period of  the reforms and observances begins around 1380. Then, after a failed first phase, centered on the eremitic ideal, a new re- form began in Extremadura, carried out successfully by Fray Juan de Guadalupe.63 In 1517, the movement is named Custodia de San Gabriel, and in 1519 it becomes independent from the observant province of  San- tiago.64 Extreme poverty and missionary zeal—reinforced by the proxim- ity of  the neighboring Granada—were the two facets that characterized this reformed observance. This Custodia de San Gabriel would become the trigger of  the legendary expedition of  the twelve. The Franciscans Jean Glampion and Francisco de los Ángeles originally conceived the American enterprise. At the beginning of  the 1520s they obtained two papal bulls with the authorization to preach freely in New Spain. But Glampion soon died, and Francisco de los Angeles was elected in 1523 as the general of  the order. Forced to surrender his mission, he chose Mar- tín de Valencia for the task, at the time the superior of  the Province of San Gabriel in Extremadura.65 We cannot understand the American vocation of  the Franciscan ob- servantia without taking account of  the penetration of  the millenarian Joachimist ideals. In this discourse, the arrival of  the Antichrist would put an end to the sixth age, and the eighth age would begin after the de- feat of  Gog and Magog and the consummation of  the Last Judgment. However, between these two ages, Joachim of  Fiore predicted a seventh one, his version of  the millenarian kingdom of  the Apocalypse. This glo- rious era of  the Holy Spirit would take place on earth, far away from the perpetual eternity of  the eighth age outside history.66 Joachim also expected a radical conversion of  the Church, transformed into ecclesia contemplantium or spiritualis after the establishment of  the third status. To accomplish this transformation he expected the appear- ance of  an order of  spiritual men sent ad vesperam huius seculi, at the 62 Marjorie Reeves, The Influence of Prophecy in Later Middle Ages: A Study in Joachim- ism (Notre Dame, Ind.: University of  Notre Dame Press, 1993), p. 228. 63 Melquíades Andrés Martín, “La espiritualidad franciscana en España en tiempos de las observancias (1380–1517),” Studia Historica; Historia Moderna 6 (1988): 468–69, 474. 64 Baudot, Utopía e historia, p. 93. 65 Duverger (n. 36 above), pp. 30–37. 66 Reeves, p. 132. </page> <page sequence="17"> History of Religions 17 end of  the seventh age.67 The Franciscans were the first of  a large lineage of  religious orders that assigned themselves this role as fulfillment of  the prophecy of  the Calabrian monk. Thus, the Franciscan Petrus Joannis Olivi took directly from Joachim of  Fiore the idea that, since the synagogue has been founded by twelve patriarchs and the church by twelve apostles, “sic finaliter ecclesia . . . est per XII viros evangelicos propaganda . . . unde et Franciscus habuit XII filios et socios per quos et in quibus fuit fundatus et iniciatus ordo evangelicus” (so the Spiritual Church must be propagated by twelve evangelical men . . . and that’s why St. Francis had twelve fellows and comrades, by whom and with whom the evangelical order was founded and initiated).68 The millenarian effervescence spread over Europe at the beginning of the sixteenth century.69 The Franciscan Order generated its own char- ismatic prophet, the Beato Amadeo de Portugal (1431–82), who in his Apocalipsis Nova announced the imminent arrival of  an Angelic Pope.70 Cardinal Cisneros dreamed of  a renovatio mundi in which, after a final crusade led by Spain, there would be unum ovile et unus pastor, and he himself  would celebrate Mass before the Holy Sepulchre.71 At the same time, Cardinal Bernardino López de Carvajal promoted the schismatic council of  Pisa (1511–13), assembled to fulfill the prophecies of  an im- minent angelic papacy.72 The Fifth Lateran Council (1512–17) tried to put an end to these millenarian expectations, condemning as reckless any prediction about the imminent arrival of  the Antichrist, even though from the twelve homilies of  the council it is clear that the prelates seemed con- vinced that the Roman Church has entered the last phase of  its history.73 One of  the signs that the arrival of  the millennium would be acceler- ated was the preaching of  the Christian faith in the most remote confines 67 Ibid., p. 135. 68 Ibid., p. 196. 69 See Ottavia Niccoli, Prophecy and People in Renaissance Italy (Princeton, N.J.: Prince- ton University Press, 1990); Miguel A.

The conversion of  Jews, Tartars, Muslims, and the Orthodox Church would be a certain sign that the seventh age was already a reality on earth. The discovery of  America was seen by the Franciscans from the Provincia de San Gabriel as a new providential event, the opportunity to accelerate the Second Coming. When making his farewell to the twelve, Fray Francisco de los Ángeles reminded them of  the importance of  their expedition, “now when the day of  the world is declining at the eleventh hour.”74 That is why Martín de Valencia, leader of  the twelve, tried to embark toward China, soon after he had settled in Mexican territory. But the American enterprise was also seen as the opportunity to build a new Christendom, a new Jerusalem, a fulfillment of  the monastic ideal of  the Joachimist seventh age, in which all men would carry out a con- templative life, exercise the apostolic poverty, and enjoy angelic natures.75 After the failure of  the old European Christendom, the friars would have to start in America from the beginning, creating on the eve of  the end of the world a terrestrial paradise, a sweet violence that would imprison the Indians in an endless childhood—an archetypal image of  divine purity.76 In the Indians, the Franciscans believed they had found the ideal raw ma- terial to build this new church. The Indians lacked the desire to acquire material goods. They instinctively practiced the virtues of  the Sermon on the Mount. The confessors did not find any deadly sins from which to absolve them.77 The Indians seemed predestined to take the empty seats that the fallen angels had left in heaven.78 The new American church would have poor bishops, and it would be so well “ordered in good Christen- dom” that, as fray Jerónimo de Mendieta said, “people would say nothing but that it is all a monastery.”79 The Franciscan utopia expressed a pro- gression toward the future that begins with a return to the past,80 here a past that conflates a magnification of  the Indian primitivism with a recon- struction of  the pre-Constantine evangelic church. The Indians and the friars would become the perfect protagonists of  this new Christendom: the childlike Adamic innocence of  the former and the seraphic androgyny 74 Adriano Prosperi, “New Heaven and New Earth: Prophecy and Propaganda at the Time of  the Discovery and Conquest of  the Americas,” in Reeves, ed., p. 290. 75 John L.

On the one hand, the old Christendom, cor- rupted and decadent, was beginning to show an interest in clipping the wings of  the new American Church. On the other hand, there were clear signs that the evangelic virtues of  the new Amerindian Christians con- cealed an unexpected attachment to their ancient idolatry. At the beginning of  the 1550s, this former concern was becoming apparent in the insistence of  the metropolitan authorities that the Indians be taught Spanish, a mandate that attacked the seraphic utopia at its heart. In fact, the crown sent a real cédula to all the provinciales of  the three mendicant orders with this new disposition.83 Olmos undoubtedly perceived the signs of  what would soon become a reality: an offensive designed to wrest the almost absolute control over Mexican Christendom that up to that point had been exercised by the mendicant orders. The por- tentous landmarks would soon start appearing one after another: the first Mexican Council in 1555, the death of  the viceroy Velasco in 1564, the coming of  the Jesuits, the formal settlement of  the Inquisition, and the sup- pression of  the apostolic privileges of  the mendicant orders—all of  these occurred in 1572.84 The second threat that disturbed the Franciscan utopia was the appear- ance of  worrying signs regarding the sincerity of  the Indian conversos, the matrix of  the new Christendom that would accelerate the end of  times. The first instance of  this awareness was in November 1539, when Olmos prosecuted and punished the lord of  Matlatlán, principal exponent of  a shrewish expression of  crypto-idolatry. Olmos allowed himself  to be pes- simistic: “it is twenty years since the scriptures have been explained to them; nevertheless, they persist in their idolatry as obstinate as before.”85 In that same month Bishop Zumárraga condemned to death a former pupil of  the Colegio de Tlatelolco, the lord of  Texcoco.86 It was in this 81 See Mircea Eliade, “Mefistófeles y el andrógino o el misterio de la totalidad,” in Me- fistófeles y el Andrógino (Barcelona: Kairós, 2001), p. 119. 82 J.

Francisco Marroquin, bishop of  Guatemala, found what he called a surprising and alarming “amount of  idols and ritual objects in the south of  Chiapas, dur- ing the visitas he carried out between 1551 and 1554.88 This prompted the prelate to commission the Dominican Dimingo de Vico to write his Tratado de idolos, practically at the same time that Olmos was working on his own Tratado de hechicerías in Hueytlalpan. One of  the greatest dis- appointments would occur in 1562, when the Franciscans from Yucatán discovered idolatrous practices at the heart of  their missionary enterprise. The violence of  the following repression revealed the magnitude of  their disillusionment.89 The friars had to face the evidence: almost all the neo- phytes would have deserved inquisitorial proceedings.90 When cultures feel threatened they start telling stories.91 These are quasi-hysterical reactions, typical of  situations of  real or imagined forms of  pressure that seem to question the security of  their own identity and that of  others.92 The Franciscan utopia seemed to become, in the stressful situation beginning in the 1550s, an appropriate means to reinforce the positive self-definitions and the differences that separated the new Amer- ican Christendom from other groups. The Tratado de hechicerías by Andrés de Olmos can then be conceived as an attempt to rescue the se- raphic project from its announced decadence. Its interlocutors are the Indians, without intermediaries: that is why the manual is written in Nahuatl, to be read and to be directly preached in the language of  the country. Olmos thus changed the genre of  Castañega’s original: from a treatise for the formation of  the diocesan clergy to an edifying sermon for the Amerindians. This transformation can be clearly perceived in the numerous markers of  orality present throughout the text.93 87 Ricard, pp. 411, 414. 88 Amos Megged, Exporting the Catholic Reformation: Local Religion in Early Colonial Mexico (Leiden: Brill, 1996), pp. 66, 105. 89 See Inga Clendinnen, Ambivalent Conquests: Maya and Spaniard in Yucatan, 1517– 1570 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987), pp. 76–77. 90 Jacques Lafaye, “La utopía mexicana: Ensayo de intrahistoria,” in Mesías, cruzadas, utopías: El judeo-cristianismo en las sociedades ibéricas (México: Fondo de Cultura Económica, 1984), p. 85. 91 Joshua Levinson, “Bodies and Bo(a)rders: Emerging Fictions of  Identity in Late Antiq- uity,” Harvard Theological Review 93 (2000): 344. 92 K.

In the “Exortación al Indiano lector,” one of  the fragments that is not included in Castañega’s original, Olmos reaffirms the new identity de- rived from baptism, an excluding identity without return or ambiguities: “And now you have forgotten, when you were baptized you have hated, despised, abandoned the devil . . . so that God would help you if  you do not have a twofold heart, if  you do not have a twofold tongue. . . . Now if it is true, with your open heart that you belong to God here, behind you . . . you will banish from your mind . . . the unjust diabolical world.” Ol- mos reminds the Indians of  their perpetual dependent status under the tutelage of  the friars, and of  their specific role in the new American Chris- tendom: “If  there is something you do not understand correctly, immedi- ately ask the [Franciscan] father.” And he adds: “that man who does not ask the father, maybe desires to do good things, but he may also have thoughts that will make him go astray. . . . That is why he will be very good, the humble common man, following those who are above him.”95 The sera- phic utopia condemns the Indians to a paradoxical liminal period, that, far from being transitory, acquires a permanent character in which the subjects find few or none of  the attributes of  their past or future status.96 The Indians were neither pagans nor old Christians; they would not even be new Christians should they lack the permanent assistance of  the friars. To strengthen the providential qualities of  the new Christendom, Ol- mos compares its image to the corrupted description of  the European Old Church. The choice of  Castañega’s Tratado—a threatening description of was an inspiring figure for Andrés de Olmos.

Ahora si de verdad, de buen corazón, perteneces a Dios allá, detrás de ti . . . relegarás . . . al injusto mundo diabólico” (my emphasis). “ ‘Si algo no en- tiendes bien, interroga al instante al padre’. Y agrega: ‘aquel hombre que no pregunta al padre, quizá desee hacer cosas buenas y también quizá abrigue pensamientos que lo pier- dan. . . . Por eso mismo será muy bueno él, el hombre del pueblo, humilde, seguirá a aquel que está por encima de él.’ ” 96 Compare Victor Turner, “Entre lo uno y lo otro: El período liminar en los rites de pas- sage,” in his La selva de los símbolos: Aspectos del ritual ndembu (Madrid: Siglo XXI, 1990), p. 104. </page> <page sequence="22"> 22 Witches, Idolaters, Franciscans the advance of  the diabolical conspiracy in the Old World—was also im- portant for this strategy. The Christian virtues that the Franciscans were anxious to recover for themselves suddenly appeared before their eyes, incarnated in the Amerindians, a whole race of  men consecrated to evan- gelic poverty. The friars saw themselves reflected in the simplicity of  the natives through a process of  self-projection of  their own identity, rather than through a trustworthy description of  the other.97 As opposed to friars and Indians, European Christendom seemed confined to eternal perdition. In the prologue of  the Tratado, written in Spanish, Olmos compares the veija christiandad with a dry tree and the new one with a green tree: “if the old Christianity burns, it is no wonder to see the new one on fire as well, since the enemy has no less envy, rage, and rancor that he feels for those who have not long before fled from his hands.” The new Amerin- dian Christians, then, seem to keep the possibility of  salvation that the old Christians had already lost. The lurking of  the devil was more real than ever: Satan would also try to corrupt the new Christendom, and his triumph would do nothing but hasten the end of  history and his own final defeat. Only a godly life and a strong faith could halt the increasing attacks of  an enraged devil. The neophytes, if  they accepted baptism with sin- cerity, would have an advantage over old Christians: “and each day [the devil] encircles and surrounds his prey to chase it anew, and only a trained faith can impede his catch, because a tepid or dead faith does not want to resist him.”98 But the vieja christiandad was also present in New Spain. Thus the ne- cessity to avoid any contact between the Indians and European corruption: “because this New Spain is already entangled with various nations, and wherever there is a crowd, there is confusion. Through this treatise, I want to warn the simple ones that as it is usual that in some cases a tongue or corrupt custom gets stuck to someone, this venom and pestilence must not infect you or be transmitted to one another.” And then Olmos finished with a suggestive admonition that seems to reserve paradise only for friars and Indians, the pillars of  a new apocalyptic Christianity: “and I beseech that the care and diligence of  shepherds and the heads of  the church should be awake and alive, and that they will show so much concern for those souls they are in charge of, so that these will go with them to Heaven and 97 Compare Stuart Schwartz, “Introduction,” in Schwartz, ed. (n. 37 above), pp. 3–4. 98 Olmos, p. 4: “si la vieja christiandad se quema, no es de marauillar que arda la nueva, pues el enemigo no menos embidia tiene, enojo y rencor tiene destos que poco hase se le es- caparon de las uñas.” “Y cada día [el demonio] cerca y rodea la presa por la tornar a correr al qual sola la fe formada le es impedimento, porque la fe tibia o muerta, poco o nada se es- panta” (p. 4).

Instead, the opposites are here two different ways of  conceiving the hierarchy that orders the relationship between the new and the old. Both elements are already present in each of  the moieties. That is why they do not embody values that need to be exchanged. But each moiety depends on the reversed image of  that hierarchy (embodied in the opposite moiety) to reproduce its own hierarchy.100 Thus, whereas the old Christianity provided the Indians with a subordinate status—the blemish of  the converso—the new Christendom transformed the corrupted faith of  the old Christian into the reality that Amerindian neophytes were forced to overcome. The radical condemnation of  European Christianity seems to turn Ol- mos’s discourse into a fractured enunciation that challenges the hegemonic discourse from a subordinate perspective. However, his Tratado is less a discourse of  resistance than a discourse claiming its own centrality. Even though the Franciscan establishes a different place of  enunciation from the periphery, his purpose is to rescue the purity of  Christianity, which he considers the supreme value of  European civilization and whose purity he aspires to recreate on another continent. Hence Olmos’s discourse does not surpass the limits of  a universalizing narration, the supreme truths of a revealed religion that prevent the complete recovery of  the differences of  the local culture.101 To see non-Western peoples as having themselves become the standard-bearers of  Western culture is in some ways a more profound form of  colonization, the search for its own idealized image in the imperfect copies fabricated by other cultures, ethnocentrism thinking itself  as antiethnocentrism.102 But the vieja christiandad was not the only inverted image that Olmos used to strengthen the new providential identity of  Amerindian neophytes. 99 Ibid., p. 5: “porque ya esta Nueva España se va mezclando de diuersas naciones, y donde ay muchedumbre ay [sic] está la confusión. Deseo con esto avisar a los unos y a los otros simples en tal manera que así como a algunos se les pega la lengua o costumbre cor- rupta la tal ponçoña y pestelencia o semejante no se pegue o traspase de unos en otros” (my emphasis). “Y ruego se abiue y despierte el cuidado y diligencia de los pastores y rectores de [la] yglesia, y que tal solicitud pongan en las ánimas que a cargo tienen, que al fin con ellas en el cielo para siempre reynen.” 100 See Valerio Valeri, “Reciprocal Centers: The Siwa-Lima System in the Central Moluc- cas,” in The Attraction of Opposites: Thought and Society in the Dualistic Mode, ed.

Like the rabbis after the destruction of  the Second Temple, the friars tried to replace a genealogical model with a contractual model for the construction of  fictitious ethnicities. In the first, the inside and the outside were established according to biological descent, whereas in the second, identity was built on the acceptance of  a certain institu- tionalized system of  beliefs.103 Baptism should then replace ancestral re- lationships as the articulating axis of  this new imaginary community.104 To achieve this, a vast pedagogical industry had to compel the neophytes to a permanent exercise of  oblivion-recollection of  the past. The pagan ceremonies had to be remembered, but only as expressions of  a diaboli- cal cult, not as legitimate exercises of  latria. Out of  these amnesias spring narratives, as when an adult is informed that the baby in the picture if  no other but himself. Out of  this estrangement comes a new identity, which, because it cannot be “remembered,” must be narrated.105 As Olmos re- minds the Indians, “you should know that a long time ago, at the time of your grandfathers, the Devil penetrated a stone, a stick, a person that was used as an intermediary, to talk, to deceive a lot.”106 As a chronicler once imagined, it would have been necessary to exter- minate all the elderly at the end of  the conquest to eradicate forever the memory of  idolatry, that intrinsic evil that children learnt in their cra- dles.107 For the time being, the friars banished to hell the venerated an- cestors in toto: “our grandfathers did not take shelter in a good deity, and in this way they would not know any charity.”108 Thus, every object that represented in any way some form of  solidarity within the lineage, such as the small reliquaries in New Spain or the mummies in Central Andes, deeply angered the preachers.109 Fray Andrés warned: “if  a man receives 103 Levinson (n. 91 above), p. 344. 104 I use this term in the sense provided by Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism (London: Verso, 1991), p. 6: “the mem- bers of  even the smallest nation will never know most of  their fellow members, meet them or even hear of  them, yet in the minds of  each lives the image of  their communion.” 105 Ibid., pp. 200–204. 106 Olmos (n. 17 above), p. 17: “sabréis que hace ya mucho tiempo, de cuando los abue- los, el Diablo penetraba en una piedra, en un palo, en una persona que servía de intermedi- ario, para hablar, para engañar mucho” (my emphasis). 107 See Carmen Bernand and Serge Gruzinski, De la idolatría: Una arqueología de las ciencias religiosas (México: Fondo de Cultura Económica, 1988), pp. 101, 154. 108 Olmos, p. 23: “nuestros abuelos ne se refugiaban en una buena divinidad, y así no conocerán ninguna caridad” (my emphasis). 109 See Serge Gruzinski, La colonización de lo imaginario: Sociedades indígenas y occi- dentalización en el México español.

As in the examination of  con- science, Olmos assumes that in every Indian there exists not one self  but two: one that bears the marks of  an unexamined past and another that re- orders and reads those marks, a temporal division between a self  that reads and one that is read.111 As Olmos argues, “neither would you believe in dreams, in deceiving words, in the bad things whose memory your parents or your grandparents had left, blind people who did not believe in the real God, who did not know Him. And now you discover their mistakes, not that you know them.”112 In the same way that the old Christianity was present in New Spain, however, the diabolical idolatry cunningly disguised itself  inside the new Amerindian church: “in the middle of  the people, among the people lived the wicked, . . . and they drag people to ruin, to disease, they make them wretched, they punish them severely with pulque, with mushrooms, so that they would become evil.”113 As with witchcraft in Europe, the idiom of  idolatry was a way of  defining the limits of  the moral community, a frontier that prohibited relationships, that authorized interchanges, and that created marginalities.114 That is why Olmos recounted the responsi- bilities of  those who, because of  not avoiding contact with wicked men, would fall again under the power of  the devil: “the nahual would leave us his tyranny as a memory, his hypocrisy, his wickedness. . . . It is said that 110 Olmos, p. 73: “si un hombre recibe algún signo de su padre, de su madre o de una abuela para mostrar que le dejan el trabajo de hacer amistad con el Diablo, aunque el hijo no crea en esto, si quizá aún un hombre agarra las cosas dadas por el adepto del Diablo sin de- spreciarlas, parece como si asi permitiera al Diablo hacer aquello que hizo en su nombre su madre o aquel que le dejó estas cosas diabólicas.” 111 Vicente L. Rafael, Contracting Colonialism: Translation and Christian Conversion in Tagalog Society under Early Spanish Rule (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1996), p. 100. 112 Olmos, p. 21: “tampoco irás a creer en los sueños, en la palabra engañosa, en las cosas malas cuyo recuerdo han dejado tus padres, tus abuelos, ciegos que no creían en el verda- dero Dios, que no lo conocían. Y ahora descubre la falta, tú que la conoces” (my emphasis). 113 Ibid., p. 28: “en medio de la gente, entre la gente viven los malvados . . . y arrastran a la gente a la ruina, a la enfermedad, los hacen desgraciados, los castigan muy duro con pulque, con hongos, para que vengan a ser malvados” (my emphasis). 114 See David Warren Sabean, “The Sacred Bond of  Unity: Community through the Eyes of  a Thirteen-Year-Old Witch (1683),” in Power in the Blood: Popular Culture and Village Discourse in Early Modern Germany (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984), pp. 109–10. </page> <page sequence="26"> 26 Witches, Idolaters, Franciscans he could transmit this to somebody, to hand it over, to cover them with it; as long as they get near him, then he will communicate it, he will blind them. But . . . he would not be able to do this job if  it is not out of willingness. . . . Because truly if  he, the nahual, takes away from her mother a young maiden to become friends with the Devil, it would be only because it is the maiden’s will.”115 The radical alteration of  the subject in Olmos’s Tratado is useful to ex- plain the formal alterations that Fray Andrés introduced in Castañega’s original. First, there is the change of  title: from Tratado de las supersti- tiones (Treaty regarding superstitions) to Tratado de hechicerías (Treaty regarding sorcery). Second, there is the excision of  the thirteen chapters that make up the second part of  Castañega’s work. The objective of  Fray Martín was to remind the old Christians that those apparently harmless superstitiones were ways of  contracting a tacit pact with the devil, scarcely separated by a difference in degree with respect to the Sabbath atrocities. That is why the chapters of  the second part were really the core of  Cas- tañega’s Tratado. The first eleven chapters that describe in detail the dia- bolical counter-church were nothing but dependent on the other thirteen. That theological fiction of  the first part justified the intrinsic diabolical character of  the real practices described in the second. On the contrary, Olmos’s aim was more urgent. The Amerindians still lived very near to that real idolatry from which they had been rescued. The counter-church here was not a mere theological fiction, like the Sabbath of  the witches. Fray Andrés’s concern then was not the vulgar superstitions of  the old Christians (the tacit pact) but the relapse into paganism of  the New Christians (the explicit pact). In New Spain, the former seemed dilute compared with the generalized presence of  the latter, the naked worship- ping of  false idols. In the New World, superstition developed into idol- atry, and idolatry evolved inevitably into apostasy. That is why the Tratado de las supersticiones becomes the Tratado de hechicerías, and both original parts transform themselves into one text, in which only the counter-church that includes idolaters and apostasies is described. The new Amerindian church—the axis of  the providential mission to which the Franciscans believed themselves predestined—had to be preserved from this diabolical counter-church. 115 Olmos, p. 71: “el nahual dejará en el recuerdo su tiranía, su hipocresía, su maldad. . . . Se dice que esto lo podrá transmitir a alguien, dárselo, cubrirle con ello; en cuanto se acerquen a él, entonces se lo comunicará, lo cegará. Pero . . . no se podrá tomar este tributo de trabajo si no es por voluntad propia. . . .

Forced by necessity to adapt that text to the American reality, Fray Andrés had to display an interpretation of  the di- abolical power significantly different from the radical demonology that was triumphing at the same time in Europe. During the first Christian millennium, the demon was a discrete char- acter. Ignored by the art of  the catacombs, his freedom of  action limited by Augustinian providentialism, his figure did not obsess—at least out- side the monastic cloister—the laity and the clergy with the intensity that it would from the last centuries of  the Middle Ages onward.116 After the resurrection of  Christ, the demon did not have a chance: the battle was inexorably won. In fact, until the awakening of  the scholastics, demonol- ogy did not exist as an autonomous discipline.117 But from the fifteenth century onward demonology acquires new di- mensions, transforming itself  into one of  the more dynamic disciplines within theology, a true natural science of  demons.118 No other period of the history of  Christendom was more obsessed with the figure of  the devil than the period that covers the fifteenth to the seventeenth century. In fact, our interaction and dialogue with the supreme adversary of  the Christian god is established at the beginning of  what we call modernity.119 If  Augus- tine seemed to conceive diabolical wickedness in terms of  inner tempta- tion, the Malleus Maleficarum considered it more in terms of  physical harm, as the cause of  material misfortunes rather than as the result of sin.120 The symptoms of  this early modern obsession with the demon are widely known, in particular witch-hunting, a unique and paradigmatically modern phenomenon.121 This pessimism and tragic vision is reproduced 116 Robert Muchembled, Une histoire du diable, XIIe–XXe siècle (Paris: Seuil, 2000), p. 24; cf.

Iconography represented Satan with imperial attributes, sitting on the throne like the perfect inverse of  God the Father, the Pope, or the absolute monarchs.122 The period that stretches from the Reformation to the Enlightenment was the only one in Western history to present an image of  the pact with the devil in which he was un- doubtedly the winner.123 The novelty of  positive demonology has made some scholars affirm that this theological discipline was not inscribed in the medieval religious dis- course, that it had emerged abruptly in a very disconcerting discontinu- ity.124 Several explanations for this radical transformation of  the religious discourses have developed, all of  them centered on changes initiated from the twelfth century on. One such change was the concern with the menace of  Cathar dualism.125 A second was the dissemination from the cloisters of  an image of  the devil that seemed, by dramatic exigency of  the monas- tic exempla, a figure with a high degree of  autonomy, the indefatigable enemy of  virtuous men rather than the deserved scourge of  sinners.126 A ed.

Aquinas essentially developed an angelology, which insisted on the infinite distance that separated the angelic powers vis-à-vis the potentia Dei absoluta.128 Nevertheless, his detailed and systematic description of  the fantastic virtues of  seraphic natures later facilitated the comprehension, in theological terms, of  the deeds attributed to demons and witches since the middle of  the fifteenth century.129 A second contribution of  Saint Thomas was his reformulations of  the problem of  evil: by clearly differentiating divine will from divine permission, Aquinas allowed a considerable expansion for the devil with- out affecting the omnipotence and goodness of  the Creator.130 The Tratado de las supersticiones by the Franciscan Castañega is a clear expression of  this modern radical demonology. A historian has recently made it clear that, even though Fray Martín never quotes the Malleus Maleficarum, it is evident that he displays the same topics in the same order.131 Castañega represents a moderate version of  modern demonol- ogy, typical of  Spanish Renaissance theology. Even when he accepts the reality of  the Sabbath and the witches’ flights, Castañega also holds that the same phenomena frequently occur only in the imagination of  the bruxas. This modern interpretation was remote from the more radicalized versions of  modern demonology, which tried to impose the thesis that imaginary flights were the exception and real flights the norm. In any case, the common element between both demonological conceptions was the acceptance of  the extraordinary preternatural powers of  the devil, de- rived from his angelic nature, which made possible and plausible the di- verse components of  the Sabbath stereotype.132 “We read,”—Castañega states, “that the angel took Habakku from Judea to Babylon with the food 127 See John Bossy, “Moral Arithmetic: Seven Sins into Ten Commandments,” in Con- science and Casuistry in Early Modern Europe, ed.

For the theology derived from Saint Augustine and Aquinas, the devil could produce real effects on the material world. For the former, super- stitious practices were supposed to resort to the illegitimate but effective preternatural causality derived from the devil’s natural powers.134 Saint Thomas did not doubt the capacity of  separate intelligences to act on the material world, from their dominance of  local movement: for Aquinas, diabolic magic could be effective.135 Such a degree of  power attributed to the enemy of  the Christian God complicated the evangelization of  those peoples that had recently abandoned paganism. Added to the identification of  the old local gods with the demons of  Judaism and Christianity, such interpretation strengthened the belief  in the real powers of  the ancient pagan pantheon and the temptation to take possession of  your enemy’s enemy.136 There were also theological reasons that could even apply to the superstitions of  European Christians: while the illocutionary acts di- rected to God by the pious believer not always produced the desired effects—Castañega develops a whole section on the reasons that prayers are often not heard by the deity—those directed to the demon by sorcer- ers and homines superstitiosi paradoxically always produced the desired effects.137 How can you introduce to the idolaters such a demon-hidden face of  their old gods, deities that not only possess powers to produce real effects, but also to carry out the wishes of  their followers more fre- quently than the Christian god hears his followers’ prayers? That is why, at the time of  the conversion of  Europe, preachers were tempted to spread the image of  an impotent demon, lacking enough power to produce real effects in the created world. This was the case with the first Council of  Braga (561); the Indiculus Superstitionum, appended to a copy of  the canons of  the Council of  Leptinnes (ca. 743); the De Singulis Libris Canonicis Scarapsus by Pirmin of  Reichenau (d. ca. 754); the Penitencial de Silos (ca. 800); the De Grandine et Tonitruis by Agobard of  Lyon (d. 840); the famous Canon Episcopi, reproduced for the first time by Regino of  Prüm in his De Ecclesiasticis Disciplinis et Religione 133 Castañega (n. 10 above), p. 67: “leemos que el angel llevó a Abacuc de Judea a Babi- lonia con la comida que llevaba para . . . Daniel . . . ; y dice que lo llevó de un cabello de la cabeza, sólo para denotar la virtud y poder del ángel para llevar a un hombre.” 134 Campagne, Homo Catholicus, pp. 56–62. 135 See Hopkin, p. 115. 136 Taussig, The Devil and Commodity Fetishism (n. 30 above), p. 43. 137 Maggi (n. 49 above), p. 88. </page> <page sequence="31"> History of Religions 31 Christiana (c. 906); and the tenth and ninth books of  the Decretum by Bishop Burchard of  Worms (c. 1008–12)—particularly the latter, tradi- tionally known as Corrector.138 Some American texts reproduced the image of  a demon radically im- potent.139 Nevertheless, the evolution of  scholastic angelology and the spread of  modern demonology made it difficult to hold such a position in theological terms. In the case of  Olmos, an additional complication re- sulted in the choice of  Castañega’s Tratado as a source of  inspiration, since it was an example of  radical modern demonology. Fray Andrés had to resignify the image of  the demon in accordance with various simultaneous strategies. To begin with, he had to reinforce the creatureness of  the demon with an even greater emphasis than is found in the patristic and scholastic traditions. For this, following a convention typical of  the first generation of  Franciscans in Mexico—later contested by Bernardino de Sahagún—Olmos identifies the devil with the figure of the tlacatecolotl, the owl-man: “you should know that this owl-man is mentioned, he is really called by a multitude of  names: bad angel Devil, Demon, Satan.”140 The term could make reference to a variety of  sor- cerers, who could be hired to cast spells, or to a wicked nahual, a quasi- shamanstic human figure possessing the power to transform himself into different animals.141 In any case, this choice placed the demon in a 138 For the Council of  Braga, see Valerie Flint, The Rise of Magic in Early Medieval Europe (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1991), p. 111; for the Indiculus Super- stitionum, see John T.

Secun- dum omnia, quae docent melefici homines, quae non sunt conformia his queae Christiani ex- ercent et operantur sunt fraudes Demonis? R.

Regarding the description of  the real powers of  the demon, Olmos adopts a compromising strategy: according to his source—Castañega’s Tratado—Fray Andrés displayed the virtues of  the angelic nature of  the devil in accord with scholastic theology. But at the same time, the Fran- ciscan puts extreme stress on the predisposition of  the demon to deceive, to lie, and to perform illusions or carry out frauds. In the Tratado de hechicerías, Satan is an extremely powerful angel and at the same time an inveterate trickster.142 Olmos reproduces the exploit of  the biblical angel that carried Ha- bakkuk through the air holding him from a hair, a definite proof  of  the natural powers of  pure spirits: “it is written that an angel took Habakkuk when he lived there, in a place called Judea; he just picked him up from a hair . . . thus proving the virtue and the strength of  the angel to take someone away.”143 His control over nature cannot be denied, especially if the deity gives him permission to exercise his powers openly: “he is able to throw fire up there, through the air, and make it change places; he will then move the air, in such a way that a whirlwind will rise, or maybe not rise if  God does not allow it.”144 Another of  the exempla describes a storm and shipwreck caused by the devil.145 At the same time, to neutralize this image that orthodox angelology did not allow him to ignore, Andrés de Olmos introduces the principal change made to Castañega’s original. The sorcerers, the idolaters, and the pagans should make no mistake: the devil never keeps his promises; he never employs his great powers for the benefit of  those who conjure him. As in many cultures, the evil spirits are here masters of  illusion. His power over men comes from his capacity to deceive human minds, to dis- play a veil that distorts human ability to perceive the world as it really is, and to apprehend the hierarchies that order the chain of  being and show the correct place that demons should occupy in the cosmos.146 In Sri Lanka 142 For the tension between both ways of  demonization of  the Indian religions, see Ken- neth Mills, Idolatry and Its Enemies: Colonial Andean Religion and Extirpation, 1640–1750 (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1997), pp. 223–24. 143 Olmos, p. 51: “está excrito que un ángel se llevó a Abachuc cuando vivía allá, en un lugar llamado Judea; tan sólo lo agarró por un cabello . . . , así probando la virtud y la fuerza del ángel para llevarse a alguien.” 144 Ibid., p. 63: “bien podrá lanzar el fuego allá arriba, por los aires, y podrá hacer que éste se mude de sitio; así acompañará al viento, de tal suerte que un torbellino de viento se levan- tará o acaso no se levantará si Dios lo impide.” 145 See ibid., p. 35. 146 See Bruce Kapferer, A Celebration of Demons: Exorcism and the Aesthetics of Heal- ing in Sri Lanka (Providence, R.I.: Berg; Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1991), pp. 1–6, 155–56. </page> <page sequence="33"> History of Religions 33 as in baroque Europe, the task of  the exorcist is to break the illusion that blurs the pristine order of  things.147 “The devil,” states Olmos, “does not always offer what a wicked heart wants, the Devil does not give him satisfaction, because he who does not aspire to God will always be deceived by the devil.”148 With this last ex- pression, Olmos abandoned one of  the essential characteristics of  the demonological discourse: its intrinsic ambiguity.149 If  in the Augustinian model of  superstition the demon can often produce those effects that the homo superstitiosus does not obtain, through the natural and supernatural ways, in Fray Andrés’s discourse the devil infallibly breaks his promises. That conventional language of  superstitious signs mentioned by Augus- tine, those pacta cum daemonibus, would always be broken by the devil: “the Devil who is a flatterer, very shrewd, promised and offered many riches, but then he mockes and laughs at people.”150 The impotence of  the devil, then, is not due to his natural incapacity to produce real effects in the material world, but to his incurable tendency to lie: “nobody will be consecrated to the Devil no matter how poor he is, since he only gives faked things, and afterward something horrible and scary would happen to them.”151 The same happens with fortune telling. In the few exceptions in which he avoids deceit, the devil only tries to conceal his perfidy: “and if sometimes, seldom does the Devil say true words, it is very often because he wants suspicion to disappear, because he wants to swindle; it is just to simulate his lies, his slobber.”152 In the same way that in the Eucharistic transubstantiation the divinity makes use of  the disjuncture between substance and accidents, the demon uses the distance that separates reality from appearance to create in the imagination independent images of  the objects perceived through the senses, eidola rather than phantasmae.153 Fray Andrés states: “the Devil is capable of  blurring somebody’s knowledge, what is called senses, so in this way [the person] disappears in a deep dream; so he . . . thinks that 147 Maggi (n. 49 above), pp. 106, 111; Kapferer, p. 104. 148 Olmos, p. 37: “El diablo no ofrece siempre aquello que desea un corazón malvado, el Diablo no le procura satisfacción, porque aquel que no aspira a Dios siempre será engañado por el diablo” (my emphasis). 149 See Fabián Alejandro Campagne, “El rosario del soldado o el combate por el sentido: La polémica en el seno del discurso antisupersticioso (España.

In accord with the monopoly on the revealed truth that Christianity claims, Olmos carries out an exercise that simulta- neously denies and affirms the incommensurability between European and American cultures, that denies everything pertaining to the divinity in the local culture, but that finds everywhere in the Amerindian religions the traces of  its enemy, the devil. Olmos introduces in his manual significant formal changes regarding Castañega’s treaty. Castañega’s work not only loses its title, but also its original structure, since it is reduced to only eleven out of  the twenty- four original chapters. These alterations reflect the different strategies that the two authors had. If  the model reader of  the Spanish Tratado is the di- ocesan clergy—the implicit subject of  Castañega’s discourse—Andrés de Olmos directly addresses the Indians of  New Spain, raw material for the providential utopia that the Franciscans promoted in the decades im- mediately after the conquest. It was not the vulgar superstitions or the implicit pact with the devil that worried the indefatigable preacher. By 1550s traces of  doubt about the success of  the strategy of  massive conver- sion, carried out by the minor friars, were clearly noticeable. It is idola- try, which for baptized Indians always meant apostasy, that worried Olmos: in his Tratado, the explicit covenant displaces the tacit pact. This explains his changes to the title as well as the removal of  the second part of  the Castañega’s original work. To strengthen the identity of  the new Amerin- dian Christianity, Olmos compares its purity—which he believes could be preserved—with, on the one hand, European corruption, the dry tree, the christiandad vieja that burns, and, on the other hand, with the idola- try of  his ancestors, which persisted inside the already Christian commu- nities, and whose menace is compared to the counter-church of  the witches, an image that Castañega employs in Spain to condemn the vulgar super- stitions of  the christianos viejos. This change in the subject of  discourse also explains the change in genre: the destiny of  the Tratado by Olmos was not to be read, but to be preached. 154 Olmos, p. 53: “el Diablo tiene la capacidad de turbar en alguien el conocimiento, lo que se llaman sentidos, que así desaparecen en un profundo sueño: de tal suerte que . . . piensa que se produjo ante él aquello que vio en su sueño.” 155 Mills (n. 142 above), pp. 211–42; Bernand and Gruzinski (n. 107 above), p. 47. </page> <page sequence="35"> History of Religions 35 The transformation of  the original demonology displayed by Cas- tañega is another substantial change introduced by Olmos in his own work. Conscious of  the risks involved in fully showing the angelic power of  Satan, which were capable of  producing real effects and of  granting wishes with more frequency than God Himself, the Franciscan had to re- sort to a compromise in his solution. His demon is in fact the powerful angel that the scholastic angelology imagined since the middle of  the thirteenth century. At the same time, he is a trickster who in all cases in- variably deceives his acolytes, breaks his promises, and ignores every pact. He is the master of  illusion who penetrates dreams with delight, and who blurs the sight and confuses the mind. He is an impotent demon not because of  his angelic powers but because of  his fondness for lying. Not only did Olmos’s discourse distort the past of  the Amerindian civilization, its atavistic rituals, and its ancestral practices, but in his own way, waiting for the end of  the world, he also declared his rupture with the christiandad vieja, with the corrupted faith of  his believers and with the excessive power displayed by his demons.
