YANKEE, STAY HOME! Southern hospitality on hold Henry Ingram Jr. owns a plantation in Hardeeville, S.C. Every building on his property was burned and the rice crop was wiped out. The plunderers were led by a fellow named Sherman?133 years ago. Ingram is still holding a grudge, as evidenced by the fact that part of his land is for sale, though potential buyers will be turned away if they were born ?or lived more than a year north of the Mason-Dixon Line. Oh, and if your name is Sherman, don't even bother. "This is the prettiest piece of land in the county," Ingram said, "and I want to keep it that ? way.

LONG MEMORY Ex-wife calls In 40-year debt Frank A. Todd Jr., of Nevada, Mo., has a 43-year-old son for whom he's been ordered to pay child support. How this happened is that his ex-wife, Ann Todd, decided, at age 64, to turn to a lawyer for help in collecting what she said was an almost 40-year-old debt owed by her ex-husband. She backed her claim with a scrap of paper dating the case to Dec. 9,1958, and a memory ^ that Todd owed $12.50 a [m&gt; week to support Frank III, then four years old. County, Pa., Judge :*fm Donald Machen or S^^jt dered the elder Todd ^HH? to pay the original BBT^ support through May H 23,1972?when Frank W^B HI turned 18?plus interest and attorney m^^* fees, for a total of $25 315. Todd's lawyer, Robert Fall, promised an appeal. "My client never knew there was an order Courthouse Cafe, Paterson, N.J. Courthouse Coffee Shop, Wilmington, Courthouse Cafe, Troy, Ohio C0UJM City, S.D. Courthouse Cafe, Phoenix of court," he says. "In fact, the docket shows there was no order. To me, I don't know another case like it" A HONEY OF A TUSSLE Brits seek to repatriate Pooh A trans-Atlantic custody battle pitting New York City against the British Parliament can perhaps be summed up in two words: "Oh, bother." Though it's a long way from the Hundred-Acre Wood, a display case in the Donnell branch of the New York Public Library in Manhattan has served for years as the home of the original Winnie the Pooh and four of his stuffed friends. The beloved A.A. Milne characters were taken on a U.S. tour by publisher E.P Dutton and Co. in 1947. The tour lasted about 10 years, and the publisher eventually turned the critters over to the library in 1987. British Labor Party legislator Gwyneth Dunwoody initiated the campaign to return Pooh &amp; Co. to their native country. England, she said, "is where they belong, not in some stuffy glass case in New York." Things got sticky when Congresswoman Nita Lowey related New Yorkers' resolve in maintaining the status quo. "The Brits have their head in a honey jar if they think they are taking Pooh out of New York City," she said in a statement. A New York Public library spokesperson was reluctant to comment "until we get a specific request [from England]." Dunwoody, for the time being, appears to be taking an anthropomorphic approach to the matter. "[England] is where they belong," she says. "They plainly want to come home." 14 ABA JOURNAL / APRIL 1998 STORIES BY AP AND BRIAN SULLIVAN; ILLUSTRATIONS BY JOHN SCHMELZER; GRAPHIC BY JEFF DIONISE</page><page sequence="2">OBITER DICTA Merit Motions On top of establishing one of the first female-owned law firms in Martin County, Fla., Lynne Spraker of the ^^^^^^^^^^ firm Bro^ Lynne Spraker County Wom en of Distinc tion Award, which recognizes the outstanding community and professional achieve ments of local women.

Harmless Error A TRULY MINORITY VIEW ON WHAT EVERY LAWYER KNOWS Matter of Form BY ANDREW J. McCLURG It's tax time. Last week I went to collect the forms I'm going to need this year. When I was returning the U-Haul, I ran into a bunch of other taxpayers returning their U-Hauls. We were all stressed out about the mountain of paperwork loom ing ahead. This is no surprise. Surveys show tax season is a depressing time for many Americans?and trees. The tax system needs simplifying. Some proposals have been offered to accom plish this. The most popular is the "flat tax," which one fellow at the U-Haul place didn't like because he thought it was a bailout for the tire industry. Then, last night I was watching Internal Revenue Service hear ings on the Sci-Fi Channel and heard some amazing news. The irs is recommending a total overhaul of our tax forms. Under the proposal, 10 trillion tons of old forms will be recycled into papier-m?ch? replicas of adorable tax depen dents that will be sold on the Home Shopping Network as collectors' items. This will al low the agency finally to fund its top-priority project: spon soring a bright red race car on the nascar circuit. If the irs proposal is adopted, all existing forms will be replaced by a single page, the ultimate in tax-filing effi ciency, the brand new... 1 TWO-MINUTE TAX FORM 1. Taxpayer Name(s)_ 2.
