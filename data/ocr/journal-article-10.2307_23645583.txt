<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTICLES THE FALL OF THE MOCHE: A CRITIQUE OF CLAIMS FOR SOUTH AMERICA'S FIRST STATE Jeffrey Quilter and Michèle L. Koons The Moche archaeological culture of the North Coast of Peru has been reified into a political system and claimed as the first state in South America. While some recent scholarship has reduced the size of the proposed state, the idea of Moche as a distinct political, social, or ethnic entity remains. In this article we demonstrate that even by the "classic" neoevolu tionary theory of the 1960s-1980s the criteria for Moche statehood were not met. We suggest that neoevolutionary models for one or more Moche states are inadequate for understanding an archaeological culture that endured for more than six centuries, and we offer suggestions for directions for future research. La cultura arqueológica Moche, de la costa norte del Perú, ha sido concebida como un sistema político y declarada el primer estado en Sudamérica. Aún cuando recientes investigaciones han reducido el tamaño del supuesto estado moche, la concep tualización de los moche como una entidad política, social y étnica distinguible aún subsiste. En este artículo demostramos cómo, aún bajo los estándares "clásicos" del neoevolucionismo de las décadas del los años 1960s a los 1980s, nunca se cumplieron los criterios para considerar a los moche como un estado. Sugerimos que los modelos neoevolucionistas son inade cuados para definir a los moche como uno o varios estados y para entender una cultura arqueológica que se extendió por más de 600 años. Finalmente, ofrecemos sugerencias para futuras investigaciones.

The most notable Moche artifacts are fine-ware ceram ics with distinctive forms and decorations, such as stirrup spout bottles andfloreros (flower pot shaped vessels) as well as metal objects—gold-copper alloy jewelry and regalia—and other material cul ture executed in generally similar styles. It has been the distinctive Moche art style in which these objects were rendered that identifies them as Moche or not. In addition, large adobe pyramids, locally known as huacas, were built millennia before Moche, but as key structures in ceremonial centers, The above quote exemplifies Larco's view of Moche as a great civilization comparable to the bet ter-known, especially in the 1940s, cultures of the ancient Old and New Worlds. He was consciously creating a national narrative to be embraced with pride. He viewed the Moche as a kingdom with a supreme ruler presiding over lesser lords, partly based on his identification of distinct personages depicted in "portrait head" vessels and, inferen tially, because he assumed that a great civilization naturally was organized in a pyramid of power with a mler at the top and a base filled with lower classes.

It is also</page><page sequence="12">138 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 23, No. 2, 2012 important to remember that in lasting over cen turies the Moche phenomenon was constantly changing and in flux. In recent years many scholars have challenged neoevolutionary theory (Pauketat 2007; Smith 2003; Yoffee 2005). All state that simplistic neove olutionary models pigeonhole cultures and soci eties into predefined types and do not account for the unique histories and the complex power rela tions of people and the places that they occupied. Following this precedent and having critiqued the concept of a Moche state, we are reluctant to sug gest what Moche was as the term might be defined in a number of ways. But we feel obliged to make an attempt at a definition. We suggest a modifica tion of Bawden's (1996) proposal of Moche as a religious system that served to enable the evolu tion of the state. We suggest that Moche was a reli gious system that realigned the political economies and social relations of North Coast societies. Just as the introduction of Christianity into Western Europe reshuffled social, political, and economic relations among independent political entities, so did Moche. The difference, however, is that whereas Christianity was a foreign system that inserted itself into a region, Moche appears to have been a relatively local creation although it may have first developed in the Northern Moche region and spread southwards.5 We assert the timing of the appearance of Moche traits is as important as anything else in defining what Moche was. In other words, there appear to have been multiple "Moches" in time as well as in space. An early Moche phenomenon in the mid-to late fourth century appears to have spread from the northern valleys southwards. Then the Huacas de Moche reinterpreted Moche and spread it farther south (and to Chicama) in the sixth century. In a final Moche phase, post A.D. 650, the Moche tra dition was again reformulated in processes still to be clarified and with complicated regional varia tions currently being investigated (Castillo 2010; Koons 2011; Swenson 2011). By A.D. 900, how ever, the Moche tradition appears to have ended completely. In the last half-century, many archaeologists have diligently worked at sites throughout the north coast to build one of the best archaeological records of past human behavior in South America, and the efforts of those who saw a state society helped us to attain the vision we have today. It is because of those investigations that the concept of the Moche expansive state arose and equally so, the reason why it has now fallen and continues to be critically evaluated (Lockard 2009; Quilter and Castillo 2010; Swenson 2007). Some will be sad to see the Moche state collapse and others may resist its downfall. We suggest, however, that current evi dence overwhelmingly points to a much more com plicated picture of the past in "Mochelandia" than has previously been considered when the state model was the dominant paradigm. What we lose in the state's fall we gain in a richer understanding of the past. Acknowledgments. Thanks to the editors and editorial staff of Latin American Antiquity for their work on this submis sion. Thanks also to Luis Jaime Castillo for help with the Spanish abstract. We offer special thanks to Ms. Linda Ordogh of the Peabody Museum, Harvard University, for extraordinary efforts in last minute work on the manuscript that was sorely needed and finely done. Thanks also to Richard L. Burger, Luis Jaime Castillo B., Rowan Fiad, Jeffrey Frost, Adam Herring, Steven LeBlanc, Matthew Liebmann, Daniel H. Sandweiss, Lisa Trever, and Jason Ur who all read earlier drafts of this article and offered highly valuable commentary on them even when they did not agree with our arguments. Those comments helped us to strengthen our work as did the comments of anonymous reviewers of this and an earlier draft. We also wish to recog nize and thank all of the scholars, past and present, who have worked and are working on Moche topics. In particular, all current "Mochicólogos" are highly collégial and generous in sharing their data and views. We offer this article to them in the hopes that our criticisms of current models will be accepted as our attempt to contribute to our common inter ests in better understanding the Moche and with full appre ciation of their efforts in also doing so.

Too old for the military, William Duncan Strong regu larly served as a consultant to the Navy (Willey 1988:91), and James Ford served in the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps in Alaska (Willey 1988:62-63). 2. William Duncan Strong and Clifford Evans (1952:198-200) were the first to suggest that a man found in a high-status burial, termed the Warrior-Priest, had been a god impersonator. 3. Recently, an archaeological team under the direction of Steve Bourget (Atwood 2010) at the Huaca Úcupe uncovered a high-status burial with near-identical clothing and regalia as the Lord of Sipán. This led the discoverer to suggest that a Moche state indeed was extant on the North Coast with rulers following the same ritual program. Two (or more) similar burials do not directly inform us as to political systems but rather indicate that common ritual practices were carried out on the North Coast. In this case, it may suggest that the two centers of Sipán amd Úcupe were affiliated. 4. We infer that some huacas had short periods of use, given their small sizes, while others lasted for centuries with many remodeling phases, as we have observed in the field. In fact, this research question still remains to be investigated in detail. 5. We note that Thomas Patterson (1971) used the anal ogy of the spread of Christianity for explaining Chavin. Notably, early Christianity did not have a single unified doc trine. Rather, attempts at doctrinal unity—never fully achieved—only occurred after the religion was adopted as the state cult.
