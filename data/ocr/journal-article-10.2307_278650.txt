<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY A PRACTICAL FIELD METHOD FOR THE PRESERVATION OF SOIL PROFILES FROM ARCHAEOLOGICAL CUTS D. E. DUMOND ABSTRACT A method is presented by which sections of soil pro- files are preserved through the use of liquid casein glue. The method may be used in most soils encountered by the archaeologist, and requires only materials frequently to be found in the archaeological field camp. TECHNIQUES CURRENTLY in use by soils scientists permit the removal from exposed profiles of relatively thin layers of soil, which are permanently preserved for ex- hibit or study purposes. These commonly end as vertical sections 6 or 8 inches wide, 4 feet or more high, and from a half-inch to 4 or 5 inches thick, which are hard- ened with a plastic compound - commonly cellulose acetate or vinylite resin or a combination of both - and glued to a mounting board (for example, Berger 1960; Berger and Muckenhirn 1945; Smith and Moodie 1947; Smith, McCreery, and Moodie 1952). Similar techniques may be used by the archaeologist. In 1961, while engaged in excavations in southwestern Alaska, it appeared desirable to preserve in some perma- nent fashion short sections of profiles exhibiting the superposition of a series of eight rather marked de- posits of volcanic ash. As other materials were not available, we used a solution of liquid casein glue (in this case that sold under the trade name Elmer's Glue- all), thinned with water. The resulting profiles were of natural appearance, and were light enough for trans- port by air without straining the budget (Fig. 1 d). Further experiment has led to refinement of the basic technique, as indicated below. The method has the ad- vantage of requiring only materials frequently found in the field camp, or widely available. Materials and equipment: 1. Clear-drying liquid casein glue. 2. Mounting board. This is presently a piece of 3/8sinch plywood, pre-cut to the desired size. In practice, 4 inches has been found to be an adequate width; a length of as much as 4 feet may be removed by two men work- ing together, although a length of 3 feet or less is some- what easier to handle. Along the long edges and across one short edge of the board - those which will be the two sides and the bottom of the finished profile - have been screwed strips of 3/4-inch angle aluminum, mounted so that one edge of the aluminum projects 3/s inch be- yond the face of the board, thereby forming a flat trough 3/8 inch deep, with metal sides (Fig. 1 a). This board is used both for the removal of the soil and as its final mounting. When finished, the aluminum remains in place as a strengthening guard around the edge. In the original field attempts, this board consisted of an aban- doned piece of planking which was edged with tin strips cut from gasoline cans. 3. Knife, trowel, and paintbrush. 4. A few tin cans or cardboard milk cartons. Taking the sample: 1. The vertical cut to be sampled is faced smooth and a.s nearly plane as possible. 2. If the soil is not sufficiently damp to be worked easily and to stand alone for a brief period in a vertical column of rather small diameter, water is sprayed liberal- ly onto the face by means of a tin can or milk carton which is perforated with a nail near the bottom of one side so that water will squirt out in a horizontal stream.

If the soil re- sists adequate absorption, a long object, such as a small pipe or a machete, is pounded down from the surface at a point 6 inches or so inland from the portion of the cut to be sampled, to provide a hole into which water may be poured. After wetting, it is of course advisable to suspend operations until the water has penetrated sufficiently for some sort of equilibrium to be established. In the presence of a reasonable amount of soil moisture, this step is unnecessary. 3. A solution of glue in water in the ratio of about one to ten is sprayed on the vertical surface with the can. Glue should be applied liberally. 4. Unthinned glue is squirted onto the mounting board between the aluminum strips and is smeared around with the paintbrush, the hand, or anything avail- able. This step should not be omitted - although on occasion step 3 may be forgotten with impunity - for the glue applied at this point serves to bond the finished profile to its mounting. 5. The mounting board is placed in position vertically against the face of the cut and is tapped along the edges with a convenient rock until the aluminum edges have bitten their full projecting depth into the face and the gluey board itself has contacted the soil. Pounding too hard, especially toward the center of the board, will serve to bend the aluminum angle strips and the board into a permanent warp in one direction or another. In the presence of strata of hardpan or other recalcitrant ma- terials, it may be necessary to make appropriate slashes with the knife to permit the aluminum edges to enter the soil. This is a good time to record identifying data on the back of the mounting board. 6. Immediately, while the board is held firmly against the face, vertical cuts along both sides of the board are begun with knife and trowel, angling toward center so that a column of soil the width of the board and perhaps as much as 6 inches in thickness is finally cut free. It has been found desirable to leave the very top and the very bottom of the column attached until all else is freed. It may on occasion also be helpful to tie the column to the board at intervals with strips of cloth; nor- mally, however, when two men are engaged in cutting the column loose, enough stability is achieved by their free hands, which grip column and board together, while the knee of one man presses the board against the soil. As a last step, the column is cut loose at its upper end, undercut at the bottom, and finally the entire column is laid outward from the face so that the haggled column of soil and the board may be rested together on the ground with the soil uppermost. During this last move, the presence of an aluminum guard strip at the bottom as well as along the sides of the mounting board may be appreciated, for without it the soil column will tend to slip downward along the board. A similar strip of alumi- num at the top of the mounting board adds nothing to the procedure. 7. The dirt is next faced-off even with the edges of the projecting aluminum strips. This leaves a layer of soil 3/8sinch thick, which preserves the profile of the ex- posed cut, plastered to the board. It may be helpful to mash the column firmly but carefully against the board before this last facing, to insure adequate contact. 8. The profile in its present state is carefully trans- ported to camp and is allowed to dry thoroughly, if this is possible. 9. When completely dry - after several days - more 10% solution of glue in water is applied to the surface of the profile by spraygun, tin can with small nailhole in the bottom, or in any other way possible. As much solution is added in relatively small doses as will be read- ily absorbed by the soil; puddling on the surface should be avoided, or else a rather unpleasant gloss may result. Although the glue appears white upon application, this whiteness disappears in drying, provided unabsorbed globs of glue are not permitted to stand on the surface. A quart of solution is usually ample even for soils which absorb readily, but because the amount of glue solution absorbed varies with the nature of the soil, it is well to have extra glue on hand when this step is taken. Need- less to say, care should be taken in application of the glue to avoid deforming the surface of the soil, for any deformity now will be preserved. 10. The profile is allowed to dry thoroughly again. It should be nearly rock hard. 11. More glue solution may be inserted along edges of the hardened soil, to improve the bond with the board. Cracks which develop may be similarly treated. Com- pleted profiles are illustrated in Fig. 1 b, c, d. In actual practice, it has often not been possible to allow for complete drying at stage 8. In such cases, glue has been applied to the shaved-down surface of the pro- file as soon as it has been removed from the wall of the cut, but the presence of moisture in the soil inhibits complete penetration so that the completed profile, once it has finally dried, is found to consist of a mass of dry dirt held in place by a thin skin of glue. Nevertheless, profiles in this condition are sufficiently tough to stand up under transport and should endure well enough for study purposes, although they are more subject to later spillage than are profiles which have been allowed to dry before application of the final glue solution. Although this glue method may not be satisfactory for use with extremely gravelly soil - in this case a method which uses cellulose acetate or vinylite resin and which allows the profile section to harden in situ may be prac- ticable (for example, Berger 1960: 4; Smith and Moodie 1947: 64) - it should be useful in most soils with which the archaeologist deals. Sand and scattered rocks, even rather large ones, may be satisfactorily consolidated. Rocks may, of course, require the application of extra glue with a pipette, eyedropper, oil can, or small paint brush to cement them permanently into place. Flakes and finished implements may be exposed and left in the sample if desired. 117</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Finally, it should be pointed out that profiles taken as described here may not be satisfactory in the eyes of the soils expert, who prefers removal of excess soil from the face of the profile in rough chunks which permit a view of soil structure. While such a result may be obtainable by using glue, normally a thickness of more than 3/8 inch in the final product is desirable, and it seems likely that better results will be realized through use of other prep- arations (Berger 1960; Smith and Moodie 1947: 66; Smith, McCreery, and Moodie 1952: 246 ff). To date, glue has been used only to collect thinner, more trans- portable samples which are faced off smoothly in a man- ner familiar to the archaeologist. Acknowledgments. In early 1961 Arthur A. Theisen, then of the Department of Soils, Oregon State University, provided a de- scription of the taking of soil profiles which served as a prototype for the method outlined here. Henry W. Smith, Professor of Soils, Washington State University, and Kermit C. Berger, Professor of Soils, University of Wisconsin, kindly furnished descriptions of techniques currently in use by them in the preservation of soil profiles. Some practical measures - specifically the use of a per- forated tin can in place of the spraygun, and the use of strips of cloth to tie the soil column to the mounting board - were adopted directly from Smith (personal communication) and from Smith and Moodie (1947).

UNIVERSITY OF OREGON Eugene, Oregon December, 1962 TWO FIRED-CLAY FIGURINES FROM CENTRAL CALIFORNIA A. B. ELSASSER ABSTRACT Fragmentary human figurines from archaeological sites in Sacramento and Marin counties are described. It is suggested that noting slight variations in decorative and other characteristics within the type may aid in providing a clear picture of the geographical and chronological dis- tributions of these specimens in western North America. DURING THE PAST 20 years numerous anthropomor- phic baked-clay figurines from California have been de- scribed in publications. These objects are quite often crude and schematic, and seem to comprise a fairly dis- tinct culture trait in California and adjacent regions. The trait is thought to be derived from the American Southwest. In turn, the point of origin of the South- western figurines may possibly be in central Mexico (Davis 1959: 25). Even though probably less than 100 individual examples have been found in archaeological sites in several parts of California, it appears that there has been a sufficient range of variation among the speci- mens to merit description of virtually every piece that has come to light. This note is intended to put on record two fired-clay figurines now in the collections of the Lowie Museum of Anthropology of the University of California, Berkeley. One of these (No. 1-38509), found on the surface of a site near Sacramento almost 30 years ago, has been overlooked in previous discussions, while the other (No. 1-148136) was recovered in 1962 during a large bulldozing and scraping operation in Marin County, just north of San Francisco Bay. The site, des- ignated Mrn-365, was reported by Mrs. David S. Moore, who found the figurine in a disturbed area and subse- quently donated it to the University of California. Two additional baked-clay objects thought to be basal frag- ments of female figurines were found at the same site, but are too sketchy and without enough distinguishing characteristics to merit description here. The Sacramento example (Fig. 1 a) is a fragment, and it is identifiable as a possible figurine only by the curvilinear, punctate design on its frontal surface. Simi- lar punctation has been noted on several complete Cali- fornian specimens which have additional characteristics that permit classification as female figurines (Heizer and Pendergast 1955, Fig. 62 c). The specimen is 6 cm. long, 4 cm. wide, and 2.1 cm. thick. It is tan-colored, partly mottled, and was made from a fairly fine-grained clay, slightly and possibly not deliberately tempered. Temper- ing material, fine sand grains, and numerous flecks of mica may have been present in the original clay. The fragment is decorated on one side only. There is no way of knowing what kind of implement was employed to execute the small punctations, which measure only about 1 mm. in diameter but are relatively deep (2 mm.). The fragment was recovered from the surface of the Johnson Mound (Sac-6), a site which has been exca- vated many times and which has produced literally thou- sands of baked-clay objects, most of them evidently utili- tarian. Since the alluvial soil of the lower Sacramento River valley contains few stones suitable for use in the stone-boiling process with baskets, it seems almost cer- tain that these clay objects were largely used in this proc- ess as substitutes for locally unavailable field stones. Many of these egg- or loaf-shaped objects bear decora- tion consisting of crude punctation or basketry impres- sions. Also small, bird-shaped, clay figurines have been excavated at the site, as well as another anthropomorphic figurine. The latter is described by Davis (1959: 20) as an undecorated, modeled fragment, the upper half of a female figurine containing two nodal swellings which probably reptesent breasts. The time assigned to this female figurine is A.D. 1600-1850 (Phase II of the Late horizon in central California). Since the decorated speci- men was found on the surface of the site, it probably should not be considered as predating A.D. 1600, although 118 [ VOL. 29, No. 1, 1963</page></plain_text>
