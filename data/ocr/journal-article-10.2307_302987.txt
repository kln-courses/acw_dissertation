<plain_text><page sequence="1">To Regress from the Rigor of Shelley: Figures of History in American Deconstructive Criticism* Jonathan Arac "I rose; and, bending at her sweet command, Touched with faint lips the cup she raised, And suddenly my brain became as sand "Where the first wave had more than half erased The track of deer on desert Labrador, Whilst the fierce wolf from which they fled amazed Leaves his stamp visibly upon the shore Until the second bursts-so on my sight Burst a new Vision never seen before.-" *Josue V.

Hillis Miller. Deconstruction and Criticism. New York: Seabury, 1979. 241</page><page sequence="2">Rousseau, in Shelley's The Triumph of Life The first great harvest of American literary criticism came after World War II. In The We//-Wrought Urn, Theory of Literature, Literary Criticism: A Short History and other works, a formalism that had begun as polemical opposition reached authoritative maturity. This harvest was gathered, and in the 1960's a belated, apocalyptic time of crisis trampled out the vintage. The 1970's have experienced critical fermentation, following the notable effervescence that began the decade. At that moment appeared Hillis Miller's last book and Paul de Man's first. Harold Bloom began his revisionary labors in Yeats. Geoffrey Hartman posed the still urgent question of what lies Beyond Formalism, and Frederic Jameson offered an answer in Marxism and Form. Diacritics, New Literary History, boundary 2, and other journals were founded, and since then except for Bloom and Edward Said most important critics have been publishing essays rather than books. The appearance now of two collections of essays by many hands allows for some assessment.1 After the effervescence, after the fermentation, what do we find if we drink from the proffered cup? Textual Strategies includes fifteen essays by North American and French critics, and their interest far exceeds the space I can devote to them. In "From Work to Text" (1971), Roland Barthes presents a manifesto for "textuality," offering as theses the practices of reading he had developed in S/Z to break with the structuralism of Systeme de la mode. "Generating Lautr6amont's Text" by Michael Riffaterre and "Myth and Ritual in Shakespeare" by Rene Girard are fine examples of critical positions that a novice may sample here and that others may find familiar. The volume translates characteristic work by three writers still little known in this country outside those who actively read French: "The Schizophrenic and Language: Surface and Depth in Lewis Carroll and Antonin Artaud:' (1969) by Gilles Deleuze; "On the Interpretation of Ordinary Language: A Parable of Pascal" by Louis Marin; and "The Algebra of Literature: The Wolf's Game," by Michel Serres, the most simply brilliant essay in the book. From the text of La Fontaine's fable of the wolf and the lamb, Serres abstracts nine structural layers and then moves into the philosophical revolution of the seventeenth century to conclude, "Western man is the wolf of science." Gerard Genette encapsulates the argument of his still untranslated Mimologiques in "Valery and the Poetics of Language" (1972), an essay which demonstrates that scholarship need not be archaeological. It means a great deal for us as poets, readers, and teachers to note Genette's point. In elaborating a poetics that compensated for and defied the arbitrary power of the sign, Mallarme and Valery succeeded so well that their position 242</page><page sequence="3">became "familiar," "natural," and "transparent" to us. We "do not see it any more" and therefore "have some difficulty conceiving that it has not always existed, and perhaps will not always exist" (TS, p. 373). Genette thus helps postmodernism achieve a detailed specification of that Mallarmean, modernist "literature" so crucial in the argument of Michel Foucault's Les Mots et les choses. Foucault's already classic "What is an Author? " (1969, here slightly revised) and Edward Said's "The Text, the World, the Critic" (1975) importantly emphasize the relations of literature to the world of institutions and action. I think that their more recent work, however, will better serve the reader who wants to learn from the force of their practice.2 Despite this diversity, one textual strategy preponderates. After the initial essay by Barthes, six more elaborate the position known as "deconstruction." In "Freud and the Sandman" Neil Hertz exemplifies the power that theoretical concern with figuration can bring to traditional American readerly criticism, which still cares about "emotional seriousness" and the quality of "fascinating anecdote" (TS, pp. 314, 316). Hertz's summary of what Freud in "The Uncanny" does to Hoffmann's "The Sandman" is worth repeating because it defines much postlawrentian criticism of American literature, "domesticating the story precisely by emphasizing its dark, daemonic side" (TS, p. 313). Hertz helps us back from the depths to the surface. Joseph Riddel's essay, "Decentering the Image: The 'Project' of 'American' Poetics," appeared in this journal, and Eugene Vance is also familiar to our readers. I defer discussion of the essays by Paul de Man, Jacques Derrida, and Eugenio Donato. Textual Strategies suggests that deconstructive criticism is the fact we must make sense of now, and Deconstruction and Criticism emphatically reiterates this claim. We might begin by recalling the time when the interest of deconstructive criticism became compelling in the United States. The late sixties and early seventies were the Nixon years, a time of sickening knowledge that much had gone wrong in our national life. I remember this as I read the opening of "Semiology and Rhetoric" by Paul de Man, the beginning for his work of the decade.3 Presented in early 1973, the essay follows the Treaty of Paris ("ending" the war in Vietnam) and falls within the pause between the Watergate break-in and the full scandal. Figures of politics move de Man's text from its beginning.4 To speak of criticism, he evoked "the spirit of the times." He found it opposed to "formalist and intrinsic criticism" and pushing if not toward "relevance" at least to "reference" and "reality." He summarized this spirit: "With the internal law and order of literature well policed, we can now confidently devote ourselves to the foreign affairs, the external politics of literature." Who that read de Man would identify with the complacency of "law and order," a noxious euphemism for repression? So we joined him in doubting that any such thing had been established. 243</page><page sequence="4">Moreover, the turn to "foreign affairs" in Vietnam had first compromised and then devastated the hopes for domestic social and economic well-being. Thus, the "external" move that de Man sensed was doubly associated with imperialist inhumanity. And finally, there had been a massive cover-up, whose totality had to be unraveled; it was imperative to scrutinize as closely as possible the texts of our "internal law and order." It was a Zeitgeist worth fighting, and de Man offered a weapon. Deconstruction's drive to demystification assuaged as well more local needs provoked by those established academic authorities who in the name of reason strove to suppress serious questioning of the university's social functions. In the name of reason, and by means of retort, sarcasm, vituperation, misrepresentation, and armed force these questions were managed. In contrast, deconstruction was intellectually serious. It encouraged questions and urged their pursuit to the limits of possibility. Deconstruction, moreover, opened historical vistas. Consid Derrida's "The Supplement of Copula" (1971). With philosophic moves from Nietzsche and Heidegger, Derrida questioned the linguistic science of Emile Benveniste. Before taking on Benveniste, however, Derrida defined Nietzsche's linguistic critique of philosophy as "inseperable from the development of historical linguistics in the nineteenth century" (TS, p. 83), and after Benveniste, Derrida inquired whether Heidegger himself had not fallen to the temptation to read the history of being as a fall. Thus Derrida used history to challenge philosophy, and philosophy to challenge science, as well as history to challenge science in his critique of Benveniste: "One cannot . . . use the word 'category' as if it had no history;" it is "historical haste" to ignore the "history that goes under Aristotle's name and 'legacy' " (TS, pp. 91-92). Finally, decisively, in a phrase that joins Derrida with Michel Foucault and lan Hacking against the predominant tradition of philosophical analysis, "It would be wrong to believe in the immediate and ahistorical accessibility of a philosophical argument" (TS, p. 97). Deconstruction, then, offered a history that structuralism and New Criticism both denied. Yet it was also a technique of close reading and therefore attractive and accessible to Americans familiar with new criticism. Indeed, structuralism has had little direct impact on American criticism because it does not encourage reading. Finally, deconstruction presented a winning ethos in its mixture of rigor and modesty. De Man and Derrida scrupulously, brilliantly, pointed out others' errors and incidentally suggested whole new dimensions of the texts they read. There they stopped, Derrida with a question and beyond that an impasse, de Man with a paradox that rescued him from arrogance: "Literature as well as criticism-the difference between them being delusive-is condemned (or privileged) to be forever the most rigorous and, consequently, the most unreliable" of human discourses. This tentativity, refusing to assert grand claims or emphatic 244</page><page sequence="5">closure, attractively rejoins critical writing to one of its beginnings, the essay.5 I shall return to the questions of rigor, modesty, and history in current deconstructive criticism, but first we need another history. II The romantic poets have figured inescapably in modern American criticism: Keats for the humanism of Douglas Bush and W. J. Bate;6 Coleridge for the new critics; and in moving from new criticism, Blake for Northrop Frye and Wordsworth for M. H. Abrams and Geoffrey Hartman. We may yet have a criticism that begins from the public rhetoric of Byron.7 The authors of Deconstruction and Criticism originally planned their volume as a set of essays on Shelley (DC, p. ix), and after C. E. Pulos's recovery of his scepticism,8 Shelley is an appropriate ally for deconstruction. Shelley's philosophical project, like the deconstructive critique of representation, its "semioclasty" (TS, p. 30), aimed to free us from "the misuse of words and signs." By signs, he meant "almost all familiar objects," which stand "not for themselves but for others, in their capacity for suggesting one thought, which shall lead to a whole train of thoughts. Our whole life is thus an education of error."9 No less than the philosopher, the poet must break up these signs with a violence like the "force" so crucial to deconstruction (DC, p. vii). Thus the prose of Bacon "distends, and then bursts the circumference of the hearer's mind" (S, p. 485), and in reading we may reverse the flow of power. If the middle ages created "a paradise . . . out of the wrecks of Eden" (S, p. 497), Shelley's own reading of Paradise Lost built upon what scholars would judge the wreck of Milton's intentions: "Milton's poem contains within itself a philosophical refutation of that system of which, by a strange and natural antithesis, it has been a chief popular support" (S, p. 498). Shelley thus relied on a deconstructive double reading and even used a rhetorical term to define the relation between the two readings. The doublet of "strange and natural," moreover, catches the uncanniness that so fascinates deconstruction (e.g. DC, pp. 218-31). Jacques Derrida has defined the "paleonymic" strategy of deconstruction, its hesitation to invent new master terms and its consequent practice of undoing traditional metaphysical oppositions by first reversing and then displacing them.10 So Shelley handled Aeschylus in Prometheus Unbound. In the lost conclusion to Aeschylus' trilogy, Zeus finally secures his domination through a compromise with Prometheus. Shelley used the same names but rejected "a catastrophe so feeble as that of reconciling the Champion with the Oppressor of mankind" (S, p. 133). Shelley's atheistic radicalism demanded a different resolution: the hierarchical opposition is reversed-Jupiter is overthrown-and displaced- by Demogorgon as a third term. But Shelley went further; deconstructing 245</page><page sequence="6">one opposition unlocks others. Edward Said argues that Aeschylus in the Persae helped establish the hierarchical domination of "western" over "oriental."'11 Shelley, however, makes Asia the vigorous agent who redeems the passively suffering Prometheus. In the Oresteia, moreover, Aeschylus laid a foundation for western sexism,12 which Shelley transforms in the erotic relations of Prometheus Unbound. No less than current deconstructionists, Shelley challenged the sovereignty of the subject. In "On Life" he argued that "the words/ I and you and they" are "merely marks," "grammatical devices.. . totally devoid of the intense and exclusive sense usually attached to them" (S, p. 478). This semiological critique allowed Shelley a conclusion that catches current deconstructive rhetoric right down to the frustrated, self-aware paradox that interrupts it: "The existence of distinct individual minds similar to that which is now employed in questioning its own nature, is likewise found to be a delusion" (S, p. 477). Yet if these arbitrary differences are erased, sameness fares no better. "On Life" presented the philosophical case against selfhood, but "On Love" confronted selfhood. Just because it's a delusion doesn't make it go away. Love arises from our discovery of "the chasm of an insufficient void" within ourselves and our consequent hopeless attempt to "awaken in all things that are, a community with what we experience within ourselves." That community does not exist. Shelley could only confess, "I know not the internal constitution of other men." Whenever he thought "to appeal to something in common," he "found [his] language misunderstood" (S, p. 473). Shelley's scepticism thus forced him constantly to acknowledge irreconcilable polarities, and his greatest texts inscribe the struggle to keep both poles active, to avoid the monism that would follow either from dialectical reconciliation or from the subordination of one pole to the other. The "Defence of Poetry" opens with a hierarchical opposition between reason and imagination that is classically metaphysical: "Reason is to Imagination as the instrument to the agent, as the body to the spirit, as the shadow to the substance." (S, p. 480). The basic opposition we read as that of secondary to primary: the mechanical, material, and delusive against the vital, spiritual, and reliable. And this opposition is systematically elaborated. Reason is associated with the narrativity of a "story" concerned with "time, place, circumstance, cause and effect" (S, p. 485), while imagination is associated with poetry, which in its "highest" forms is wholly indifferent to "the grammatical forms which express the moods of time, and the difference of persons and the distinction of place" (S, p. 483). The ecstasy of inspiration is joined with poetry and imagination, the rest of life with reason and story. In "Adonais" Shelley opts out of life; in a sudden transcendent move he chooses the unworldly side of the opposition, which is death but also immortality, undying influence. The "Defence," however, gradually accumulates positive 246</page><page sequence="7">material on the side of life. For poetry itself proves secondary and thus crosses over to the side of life: it is an "expression of the Imagination" (S, p. 480). The defense of poetry, therefore, necessitates the praise of the secondary: "all language, institution and form, require not only to be produced but to be sustained" (S, p. 492). After inspiration come those who "follow the footsteps" and "copy the sketches" of poets "into the book of common life." These belated figures establish our human world: "They make space, and give time" (S, p. 501). If Shelley yearned for an inspired state in which "time and place and number are not" (S, p. 483), he nonetheless cherished "the cyclic poem written by Time upon the memories of men" (S, p. 494). As in Derrida's critique of Benveniste, history challenges metaphysics. In his first book, Harold Bloom chose Shelley as a figure to lead his break away from New Haven formalism, and beyond Bloom and Pulos, Shelley has found one other decisive modern critic, Earl Wasserman, for some years a colleague of Hillis Miller and Paul de Man at Johns Hopkins.13 Wasserman was a totalizing hermeneut, master of the heterocosmic reading that reveals each work as a world of its own rather than sifting through the sedimentations that affiliate it with other worlds. Yet Wasserman recognized reading as problematic. He observed in his study of Keats, "I have limited myself to five poems because they are the only major poems by Keats that I have learned to read to my own satisfaction."14 He omitted the Hvperion poems because, as "fragments," they "lack a total structure, cannot be organic wholes, and therefore cannot be explicated, in the full sense of that word" (FT, p. 10). One discovers then in the last chapter with some shock, "In any reading of the 'Ode to a Nightingale' the turmoil will not down. Forces contend wildly within the poem, not only without resolution, but without possibility of resolution" (FT, p. 178). Later Wasserman reiterated: the poem "will thwart every effort at reconciliation and leave us no center of reference. Images and statements will alter in value metamorphically before our eyes and turn out to be their own converses as their referents are interchanged. And therefore the best that an explication of these stanzas can do is to set in action the bewildering oscillations" (FT, p. 208). Wasserman wished for a "nice organicism" (FT, p. 207) but had instead to invent a deconstructive rhetoric in order not to falsify what he read. The methodological issue is crucial. Here is a critic who knows that he means by "reading," by totality, by explication "in the full sense of that word," yet who lets this chapter stand as a reading and even calls what he does in setting in action the bewildering oscillations, "explication." What then of the deconstructive mystique of the unreadable? Of Shelley's Triumph of Life Hillis Miller claims (in syntax that mimes its subject), "The poem, like all texts, is 'unreadable' if by 'readable' one means a single, definitive interpretation" (DC, p. 226). Is 247</page><page sequence="8">Miller invoking a standard that even a master of those who read would not have recognized? III Like so many of the questions in The Triumph of Life, this one must go unanswered. I have been developing the context of expectation in which I turned to Deconstruction and Criticism and which marks my disappointment. First of all, Harold Bloom and Geoffrey Hartman do not write about Shelley at all-though their essays are well worth having. In "The Breaking of Form," Bloom offers the best brief statement of his critical position and then reads John Ashbery's "Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror." The theoretical exposition is somewhat purged of idiosyncratic terminology, and it opposes Bloom both to the pieties of traditional literary study and to the techniques of his deconstructive colleagues. Since "rhetoric has been always unfitted to the study of poetry" (DC, p. 10), Bloom seeks a "way out of this wilderness of tropes" to the human urgency of "other-than-verbal needs and desires" (DC, p. 1). Yet this very urgency prevents his subscribing to the academic "mystique of a somehow detached yet still generous, somehow disinterested yet still energetic" reading (DC, p. 6). I find tonic Bloom's charge that "deconstructionist criticism refuses to situate itself in its own historical dilemma" (DC, p. 12). If modern poetry offers only a "dearth of meaning," this is not a fact of language itself, as deconstructionists think. Rather it has been "achieved" by poets through their relation to other texts.15 Bloom's claim curiously echoes that made by Derrida against Benveniste. Has the historical promise of deconstructive criticism led only to another denial of history? Bloom acutely poses his question in terms of "achievement." Is there such a thing as human action, or do things just (not) happen? Much deconstructive criticism rests on this question. Geoffrey Hartman's "Words, Wish, Worth: Wordsworth" enlarges his body of excellent criticism on Wordsworth. Hartman engages issues raised by psychoanalysis and phenomenology, but strives for a sweet new style to lighten the burden of thought and learning. In considering Wordsworth's response to the classics, Hartman opens large historical matters of the cultural interaction of privileged texts, only to close them: In a peculiar and moving comment on idiots Wordsworth remarked that their life was with God .... The life of Wordsworth's lines is often uneasy and as if somewhere else. . ... One could apply to Wordsworth what he says of his idiot boy: "You hardly can perceive his joy." We should not forget that Wordsworth's greatest poem remained hidden, and that its power and authority (in the light of which we now read everything else) was but alluded to in the rest of his oeuvre.... 248</page><page sequence="9">Keeping The Prelude in reserve, almost like God his own son, Wordsworth reposed on a text-experience whose life remained with God. He delayed becoming the author of a poem so original that it could not be accommodated to known forms of Christianity .... The intertextual glitter of Milton, his blended might of Scripture and Classical lore, is but an undersong to Wordsworth's intratextual strain that repeats something already begotten in himself. (DC, p. 214) This is provocatively brilliant on a problem that has scarcely been acknowledged by critics of Wordsworth. Nonetheless, Hartman moves away from the "historical study" he had earlier demanded (DC, p. 187). All that remains is the history of the poet's mind and a miraculous self-begetting that achieves the goal of family romance. Hartman distinguishes himself and Bloom from the "boa- deconstructors" Derrida, de Man, and Miller (DC, p. ix), who do write on Shelley. In their essays, the work of Earl Wasserman is not mentioned, nor are Shelley's prose writings. This omission suggests a change from the earlier seventies. Deconstruction is no longer so modest, no longer so historical, but even more rigorous. Paul de Man ended "Semiology and Rhetoric" by linking the rigor of his method to unreliability; he concludes "Shelley Disfigured" by finding a "rigor" that is "more reliable" than traditional methods (DC, p. 69). According to Hartman, all five contributors share "a new rigor" (DC, p. viii). In Latin, rigor means "numbness, stiffness," and its OED senses include "harshness," "hardness of heart," "puritanic severity," as well as "propriety" and "severe exactitude." Why should critics want such a thing? We shall return to this master term after exploring further the current state of deconstruction in Hillis Miller's "The Critic as Host." IV This essay is not like "Semiology and Rhetoric," a modest proposal. It defends a practice that has already established itself, and it thereby reveals the power of de Man's earlier text. In reading Proust, de Man found "the same pattern of deconstruction" as in Nietzsche's late critique of metaphysics, and in turn that critique "exactly corresponds" to Nietzsche's earlier analysis of the "structure of the main rhetorical tropes" (TS, p. 136). Having set so much at one, de Man claimed that "the whole of literature would respond in similar fashion." He knew "no reason why analyses of the kind here suggested for Proust would not be applicable, with proper modifications of technique" to other major writers. De Man then prophesied, "This will in fact be the task of literary criticism in the 249</page><page sequence="10">coming years" (TS, p. 138). The power of de Man's text realized this prophecy. Miller's essay testifies to the effectiveness of the detour de Man established to prevent the move of literary study toward relevance or reference or reality. Miller can now take as established a "regular law" that guarantees the "self-subversion of all the great texts" (DC, p. 228). De Man had weighed the possibility of "the deconstructive moment as constitutive of all literary language," and Miller finds in literature a recurrent "linguistic moment," "the moment in a work of literature when its own medium is put in question" (DC, p. 250). Relying less than de Man upon insinuation and irony, Miller offers an outright statement of value. He finds it "more flexible, more open to a given work" to look for "heterogeneity" rather than organic unity (DC, p. 252). Yet the necessity of this dilemma is nowhere demonstrated. Wasserman found organic unity in one ode by Keats, Heterogeneity in another. This may be even more flexible and open. The language of deconstructive self-defense makes for strange company. When Miller claims that "though each poet is different, each contains his own form of undecidability" (DC, p. 248), he echoes Coleridge's theological insistence that "each Thing has a Life of its own, &amp; yet they are all one Life" (letter of 10 September 1802). Finally, we reach the "ultimate justification for this mode of criticism": "it works" (DC, p. 252). And it does. Look on your bookshelf. This calm pragmatism somewhat jars with a dominant motif in Miller's analysis of Shelley. Repeatedly, he defines Shelley's poetry as the record of a failed "performative apocalypse" (DC, p. 237), as the "failure" of words "as performatives magically transforming the world" (DC, p. 246). From the "failure of these magic performatives," Miller concludes that "words do not make anything happen" (DC, p. 244). It has become common in American deconstructive criticism to attack Austin's notion of "performative" language, but Austin never claimed that performatives were magic. He emphasized their subordination to a system of conventional and institutionalized social practice. "Speech act" philoso- phy depends upon intention and action and therefore may be deconstructed as metaphysical, as Derrida has done in "Signature Event Context." Derrida does not charge magic, however; he shows that even effective performatives are contaminated by the parasitism of fiction: not that there is no power to words, but that even words traditionally considered impotent may be strong. Once Derrida criticized Austin, the American deconstructionists have rallied to the attack. Paul de Man's comments on Richard Ohmann's speech-act criticism suggest further ground for this hostility. Such work exemplifies the danger of "moral conscience" (TS, p. 121) that tempts us beyond where we may legitimately venture. Indeed, while deconstruction first flourished here, the radical conscience of Richard Ohmann carried him not to further refinement of speech-act theory but to direct analysis of the 250</page><page sequence="11">institutions of literary study. Ohmann's English in America remains the fullest attempt to specify the relation between our words as teachers and critics and the world around us, in which things happen not magically but in disciplined ways. Ohmann's work recalls what I have already suggested. The modesty of "Semiology and Rhetoric" dissembles or ignores or forgets the power of words and techniques, even within a practice that claims no relevance or reference or contact with reality. V After the detour from history in "Semiology and Rhetoric," Paul de Man's "Shelley Disfigured" stages a history so horrid as to scare us back into the text. Through reading The Triumph of Life, de Man argues that we are deluded when we think that events can be linked in a historical continuity, whether narrative or causal or both. For the "decisive textual articulation" of the poem is "its reduction to the status of a fragment brought about by the actual death and subsequent disfigurement of Shelley's body, burned after his boat capsized and he drowned off the coast of Lerici" (DC, p. 66). Moreover, "this mutilated textual model exposes the wound of a fracture that lies hidden in all texts," and the final test of a reading will be "how one disposes of Shelley's body" (DC, p. 67). Thus, when de Man claims for Shelley an exemplary "rigor," above all the stiffness of death is imaged: "The Triumph of Life warns us that nothing, whether deed, word, thought or text, ever happens in relation, positive or negative, to anything that precedes, follows, or exists elsewhere, but only as a random event whose power, like the power of death, is due to the randomness of its occurrence" (DC, p. 69).16 This deep truth is imageless, but inevitably we lapse into "recuperation," constructing images or narrative, as does de Man in thus figuring disfiguration as a mutiliate corpse. But why choose to figure history in the rigor of a corpse? "Semiology and Rhetoric" also figured the fracture of textuality. It illustrated the "rhetorization of grammar" in a rhetorical question asked by Archie Bunker that is laughably, literally, answered by his wife Edith, until Archie explodes. De Man claimed that the "mini-text" of the rhetorical question "holds our attention only as long as it remains suspended," and that this literary interest is dissipated by the "intervention of an extratextual intention, such as Archie Bunker setting his wife straight" (TS, p. 129). "Extra-textual intention," the turn to relevance, reference, or reality, thus figured as a sexist, reactionary false consciousness. If going outside joined us with Archie Bunker, we gladly remained in. Shelley offers, against the horror at the edge of the text, the fascination of a "knot," a "self-effacing" scene that "arrests the process of understanding." Such suspension, arrest,1 7 freezing is the focus on the text de Man teaches: "The resistance of these passages is such that the 251</page><page sequence="12">reader soon forgets the dramatic situation and is left with only these unresolved riddles to haunt him" (DC, p. 44-45), such as the passage I quoted to begin. Uncomfortable as haunting may be, it spares us facing directly the "situation," the disfigures corpse, and so we remain bound. Like the "deconstructive" or the "linguistic" moment, we might call this the "moment of rigor," when in order to avoid what lies beyond, we fix our gaze on what lies before us. To "regress from the rigpr" would be to rejoin life, to be liable to naivet]e, to error, even to death. To share the rigor of Shelley, or of the "bolt-upright" erect corpse of Wordsworth's that de Man cites (DC, p. 67), is to choose "numbness, stiffness." One who gazes on the Medusa does not acknowledge that something he wishes there was missing but sees instead a tangle so complex that it turns him to stone and thus assures him of a potency that time or chance or malice cannot alter.1 8 De Man's figure of rigor reinscribes and transvalues characteristic Shelleyan preoccupations. Even the problem of "how one disposes of Shelley's body" echoes a famous anecdote. Shelley once said he would learn to swim but instead "lay stretched out on the bottom like a conger eel" until rescued. He explained, "I always find the bottom of the well, and they say truth lies there. In another minute I should have found it, and you would have found an empty shell. It is an easy way of getting rid of the body."19 De Man does not use any such intertexts because "in all rigor ... The Triumph of Life can be said to reduce all of Shelley's previous work to nought" (DC, p. 66).20 That is to say, reading "rigor" as a wish, the power of de Man's reading would be greater if the rest of Shelley's corpus were annihilated. This is an easy way of getting rid of the body. As Earl Wasserman has shown, however, Shelley resisted solutions and preferred to maintain irreconcilable polatiries-if not within any given work, then in his larger corpus. Between acts three and four of the "beautiful idealisms" (S, p. 135) of Prometheus Unbound, Shelley wrote the "sad reality" (S, p. 137) of The Cenci, a tragedy of rape, incest, and parricide. Neither work annihilates the other; they coexist as different, as do "On Life" and "On Love." Indeed, according to Shelley, not difference but "reiteration" (S, p. 477) annihilates the world for us, yet it is not right to say that The Triumph of Life merely reiterates and so reduces to naught the rest of Shelley's work. Let me link Shelley's other work to de Man's reading of The Triumph of Life "It is well that we are thus shielded by the familiarity of what is at once so certain and so unfathomable from an astonishment which would otherwise absorb and overawe the functions of that which is [its] object" (S, p. 475). The involuted syntax signals the danger for life in the self-effacing knot of life contemplating life; like Perseus, Shelley acknowledges the medusan potential and prefers to remain shielded. More crucially, the power beyond image and sequence that de Man calls the "positing power of language" (DC, p. 64) occupies the 252</page><page sequence="13">place in his argument that the moment of inspiration does in Shelley's "Defence of Poetry." In the power of the poem's inaugural sunrise to impose itself on earth, de Man sees imaged the "sheer dint of a blind force" (DC, p. 65) that is discontinuous with our existence and that we hide from ourselves by the figurations we ascribe to it. So, for Shelley, inspiration has "no necessary connexion with consciousness or will" (S, p. 506); they are part of human life in time, from which inspiration abstracts us. The famous image of the fading coal catches the discontinuity Shelley poses between the moment of power, of "original purity and force" (S, p. 504), and whatever else there is.21 De Man and Shelley both set a gap between two states, one powerful and timeless, the other human: it is only in the "intervals" between inspiration that "a poet becomes a man" (S, p. 507). For de Man being a man means only the possibility of exhibiting an exemplary rigor, while Shelley, as we have seen, hoped for more from human life, at times. De Man has not misread Shelley, but he has decisively chosen one alternative over the other. Has he chosen the more open and flexible? VI Alongside "Shelley Disfigured" it is instructive to read what Josue Harari judges the most "ambitious" (TS, p. 61) essay in his collection, "The Museum's Furnace" by Eugenio Donato. De Man and Donato both oppose history by identifying it as "archaeology"-that is, etymologically, the study of origins and, pejoratively, antiquarianism. Donato's project is all the more interesting for readers of this journal who recall his exchange with Edward Said about history in the fall 1979 Symposium. I find in the essay a rigor just opposite to de Man's. Chaucer's Franklin observes that patience will win many things that rigor never attains,22 and "The Museum's Furnace" moves to the kill so impatiently as to suggest how much critics now think can be taken for granted in the practice of deconstruction, both assumptions about how things are and judgments of those who take things differently. Donato first sketches Flaubert's linguistic nihilism, seen through the critique of the "Library" in Bouvard and Pdcuchet; next he argues that even more powerful a model in the novel is the "Museum," the failure of which demonstrates Flaubert's epistemological nihilism; finally, the museum and its delusive archaeological temporality must yield to the new science of thermodynamics (the "Furnace"), which through the theory of entropy undoes all historical models, showing that Flaubert was also a historical nihilist. Donato's reading is "contextual" (TS, p. 213); he rarely quotes from Bouvard and Picuchet. Instead he locates some of its intellectual affiliations, particularly the idea of the museum, which he joins Flaubert in deconstructing. He finds that idea silly: "The fiction is that a repeated 253</page><page sequence="14">metonymic displacement of fragment for totality, object to label, series of objects to series of labels, can still produce a representation which is somehow adequate to a nonlinguistic universe" (TS, p. 223). The museum will therefore fail "at reaching the nature and essence of the objects it displays," because, argues Donato, "it tries to understand them in relation to the spectator rather than in relation to the objects themselves" (TS, p. 225). How does this analysis relate to the texts Donato cites to represent the idea of the museum? They clearly show that the museum is not interested in objects in themselves, but they do not say that the museum was believed to reach the "nature and essence" of things. One of the texts begins, "The ideal museum should cover the whole field of human knowledge." The other starts, "In the galleries of these museums are gathered together examples of the art and craftsmanship of man." The human world is what museums represent. The ideology of the museum echoes historistic humanism, such as Vico established in distinguishing between the impossibility of our understanding the world God created and the possibility of our understanding what mankind has made. Thus, in choosing the point of view of the spectator rather than that of "objects themselves," museum-makers founded the intelligibility of their undertaking. One might deconstruct this humanism, but Donato does not. We may ask further why a double metonymic remove should doom representation. Donato notes that objects in a museum are "spatially and temporally detached from their origin and function" (TS, p. 224). Well, so is a lawyer in Washington detached in space, origin, and function from a farmer in Iowa, but is it impossible for a lobbyist to represent farm interests? When representation is held out as something that only a Bouvard or a boobie would credit, I remember what Mencken said when asked if he, the notorious freethinker, believed in infant baptism: "Believe, hell, I've seen it."23 As Hillis Miller claims of deconstruction, so may we of representation-it works. Representation works because it is not just metaphysical consolation. It is a disciplined practice. Donato ignores this completely: " 'Meaning,' the result of metonymic or metaphoric displacements, is anthropomorphic and anthropocentric, and.. . necessarily doomed to failure. Archaeology, ultimately, is not an objective science but a fantasy of the perceiving subject" (TS, p. 225). Foucault, whom Donato dismisses with more rigor than patience, has demonstrated the limits of possible statements within any discipline. Only certain people can make statements that will be accepted, and not even everything that such people say will be accepted. A discipline reaches far beyond the "perceiving subject" into rules of discursive formation and production. Donato quotes Edward Said on the purpose of the museum or philological demonstration being "to exhibit a relationship between the science.. . and the object, not one between the object and nature" (TS, 254</page><page sequence="15">p. 230). Donato concludes, therefore, that "any attempt of ours to reconstruct a history is nothing but vain fabulation" (TS, p. 231). Said's next sentence, not cited by Donato, insists that Renan's work was not vain. On the contrary, it is a "fact of power, by which the Orientalist philologist's authority summons out of the library at will examples of man's speech, and ranges them there surrounded by a suave European prose that points out defects, virtues, barbarisms, and shortcomings."24 We are back at the problem of speech acts. Representation is not merely to be judged true or false. It is something that people do, in politics, in constructing knowledge, in works of literature, for purposes and with effects. In adopting the thermodynamic point of view, Flaubert abandoned the patient particularity that would allow the registration of human facts and chose instead "a notion of history based upon any metaphor that can be read as abolishing differences" (TS, p. 236)-such as excrement, manure, garbage.25 Donato's inquiry produces a Flaubert who hates the bourgeoisie more deeply than he understands it, who, rather than analyzing his time, retreats to a point of indifference "at the end of time" (TS, p. 238). That thermodynamic point of maximal entropy is the "ultimate" from which all human action is vain, naive, deluded. For those living in a local flux of energy, however, things are different. VII We have learned much about uncanny temporality, the compulsion to repeat and the continual reappearance of the very thing that one had taken to be safely buried in the past. So in "Semiology and Rhetoric" the linguistic critique of metaphysics is marked as a "recurrent gesture," and as for the move beyond formalism, "this sort of thing happens again and again" (TS, pp. 136, 122). Now as well as describing such returns, the essay itself enacts them, appearing unrevised but doubled, in both Textual Strategies and Allegories of Reading. Again we read that the times are antiformalist, and that deconstructive reading will be the task in years to come. Even after many brilliant works of deconstruction, we read again that "little has happened ... since the innovative works of the New Criticism" (TS, p. 122). The most convincing demonstration of the claim in "Shelley Disfigured" that there is no history other than repeated violent impositions and forgettings will be if the dazzling force of "Semiology and Rhetoric" again captivates our criticism. I have tried to establish a memory that will hold it in the past. Perhaps this is my moment of rigor.

I mean Negative Capability" (letter of December 21-27 1817). 16 In "Living On," Jacques Derrida reads a text by Maurice Blanchot to show the possibility that even the random-or certain-power of death may not prevent survival (DC, pp. 107-8). In a world without cause or consequence, death loses its sting. 17 Derrida reads Blanchot's L'arret de mort, asking with Geoffrey Hartman whether this "arrest" is to be translated as "death sentence" or "suspension of death" (DC, p. 109). 18 I adopt the structure but not the referent of Freud in "Medusa's Head," The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, ed. James Strachey (London: Hogarth, 1953-1974), xviii: p. 273. Derrida notes an opposing movement of rigor in the "vitrifying structure of writing and desire in L'arret de mort" (DC, p. 139), which leads to the relation of the problematic narrator to the women of L'arret de mort: "He loves them ... dead. He loves (by) seeing them. He loves (by) seeing them dead" (DC, p. 163, ellipses in the original). Fully to untangle this knot would lead us first to reread Shelley's "On the Medusa of Leonardo da Vinci in the Florentine Gallery" and finally to rewrite Mario Praz's The Romantic Agony. 19 Edward John Trelawny, Recollections of the Last Days of Shelley and Byron (1858), ed. J. E. Morpurgo (Garden City: Doubleday, 1960), p. 49. Trelawny recognized Shelley's "mutilated corpse" by the jacket containing a "volume of Sophocles" in one pocket and Keats in the other, "doubled back" when death overtook "the reader, in the act of reading" (p. 96). 20 For a fine reading that has learned from de Man but does not hesitate to examine the rest of Shelley's corpus, see David Quint, "Representation and Ideology in The Triumph of Life," Studies in English Literature, 18 (1978), pp. 639-57. 21 On fire as "discontinuity" in the romantics, see Harold Bloom, "Shelley and his Precursors," in Poetry and Repression (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1976), p. 106. 22 Pacience is an heigh vertu, certeyn, For it venquysseth, as thise clerkes seyn, Thynges that rigour sholde nevere atteyne The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer, 2nd ed., ed.
