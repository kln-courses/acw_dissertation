L. Langness The Study of Culture: Third Edition is an introduction to cultural anthropology with a special emphasis on the key concept of culture. Its historical approach has been deliberately chosen to help students understand not only the concept of culture as it is now used, but also how it developed out of a series of real prob- lems that people were attempting to cope with-problems that are with us yet. Too often students tell teachers that they do not see how things fit together, why certain concepts are important, or why they should study anthropology or social science at all. This book provides students with that broader perspective, ranging from the early evolutionists to the beginnings of fieldwork, functionalism, and structuralism and on to the impact of postmodern theory. The Study of Culture: Third Edition represents both an expansion and an updating of the prior editions, which have been widely used in college and university courses in the United States, Canada, and Australia. M " in Ne*N, Cuitic ISBN 0-88316-594-5 208 pages Men and "Woman" in New Guinea L. L. Langness New Guinea is a vast island with a long history of human settlement and, by now, a long history of ethnographic research. Interpretations of initiation rites, procreation, blood, semen, and other things vary widely in the literature, with explanations being offered in terms of belief systems, ecology, population dy- namics, economics, social structures, and psychology. In Men and "Woman" in New Guinea, L. L. Langness examines recent work on these themes in the anthro- pology of Melanesia, especially those related to male initiations, gender identifi- cation, and the relations between males and females. Drawing upon his own extensive fieldwork among the Bena Bena people, Langness also engages problems inherent in anthropological theory, fieldwork, and interpretation. L. L. Langness is Emeritus Professor of Anthropology and Psychiatry at UCLA. In addition to The Study of Culture and Men and "Woman" in New Guinea, he is the author of numerous articles and other books, including Lives: An Anthropological Approach to Biography (with Gelya Frank), also published by Chandler &amp; Sharp.

In turn, McEwan and a team of experts bring a keenly honest assessment of how the Wari dead preserved the living-a new perspective on Andean archaeology that scholars must address. With thousands of laborers and tons of building material, the Wari made Pikillacta into a factory of mummification and a center of political allegiance legitimized by these power- ful, yet dead, inhabitants. A magisterial reference for Andean researchers."-PATRICIA J.

AA follows the mission statement and goals of the AAA by advancing anthropology as a discipline that studies humankind in all its aspects, involving archaeological, biological, ethnological, and linguistic research. It also attempts to further the professional interests of anthropologists by disseminating anthropological knowledge and illuminating its relevance to human problems. The editors of the journal seek to enhance the association's mission by publishing articles that add to, integrate, synthesize, and interpret anthropological knowledge; essays on issues of importance to the discipline; research reports; obituaries; and reviews of books, films, and exhibits. Short commentaries of no more than 500 words that further substantive discussion of significant topics that have appeared in AA in the previous six months will be published at the editors' discretion, as will reviews of films and museum exhibits. Contributions from all subdisciplines in both their basic and applied dimensions are welcomed, as are those focusing on broad, crosscutting problems, themes, and theories. Manuscripts written for the profession at large that develop general implications from exacting substantive research will be of particular interest. Collaborative work, particularly among colleagues in different subdisciplines, is encouraged, and contributions from international colleagues are desired. Submission Process The preferred means of manuscript submission is electronic, via e-mail attachment. If it is not possible to send a paper electronically, instead submit one hard copy of a manuscript on 8-1/2"x 11" paper and one copy of the final version of the paper on diskette. Whether submitting on diskette or electronically, leave the file in the program used to create it; do not convert to ASCII. For submissions on diskette, place the cover page, abstract, text, notes, references, tables, and a list of figures in one file; figures and photographs should be in a separate file. Figures or photographs should be submitted as hard copy, slides, or TIF files with resolution of 300 dpi or greater. Include the following information on the diskette label: (1) the filename, (2) the word processing program and its version number, and (3) the operating system. Use only high-density diskettes. Manuscripts should be typed and double spaced, including references, notes, and quotations. Submissions exceeding 10,000 words (including all figures, tables, references, and notes) will not be considered. "Research Reports" submissions must not exceed 3,500 words (including all figures, tables, references, and notes). Hard copies and disks are not returned to authors. Submissions must include the following: (1) a cover page with paper title, author's name, position, affiliation, and contact information, and a preferred running head; (2) an abstract of no more than 150 words ending with a bracketed list of three to five keywords or phrases; (3) body of the text; (4) notes, which may include acknowledgments before the first note (do not use footnotes or endnotes and references should not be embedded); (5) references cited; (6) tables, if applicable; (7) figures, if applicable, accompanied by a list of figures. AA follows Chicago style with a few modifications, most notably in the references cited section. Submitted manuscripts that do not conform to AAA style and format will be returned to authors. The AAA Style Guide appears on the AAA web- site at http://www.aaanet.org/pubs/style_guide.htm. A nonrefundable processing fee of $25 must accompany unsolicited manuscripts from persons who are not members of the association.
