According to its sleeve notes, this slim volume contains 'a theory which sees the presence of human bodies in the constructed world'. In fact it does not contain a theory at all, but draws upon several theories and does so without reflection upon c The editors of The Philosophical Quarterly, 1993.</page><page sequence="2">252 BOOK REVIEWS how each supposition relates to another. Accordingly it is likely to irritate those in search of philosophical insight. Further, it is a slim volume, not a slim book. The chapters do not make partial contributions to a sustained argument, but rather stand in isolation. It therefore reads as a collection of papers. The lack of unity can be garnered from Frascari's several shots at telling us what an 'architectural monster' might be. In chapter 1 we are told that 'architects can no longer do without the identification of the human body and its elements in the architectural body' (p. 4). In the same chapter we discover that 'for architecture, the body is II Mostruosissimo Mostruo (The utter monster)' (p. 9). In chapter 2 we are told that 'in architecture, monsters are always located in the joint between architectural elements' (p. 18). This seemingly innocuous point is amply illustrated by photographs of carved heads which adorn the keystones of Roman arches. All well and good, but chapter 1 had led us to believe that monsters were to be identified with the buildings themselves. Chapter 3 is quite odd but not without interest. Entitled 'A Cynic's View', it deals not with the philosophy of Diogenes but rather with the 'dog-like', always supposing these to be easily separated. Here the author gives a quite detailed and often fascinating account of certain works, mainly sculptures and etchings; but no argument supporting a view of how we are to apprehend architecture is advanced by this chapter's inclusion. On we move to 'Mostri Sacri', where Frascari pronounces that 'another canonical monster is the basilica designed by Palladio in Vicenza, a colossal whale emerging over the crossing of the Cardus and the Decumanus of the urban fabric of Vicenza' (p. 53). But this metaphor, moribund if not quite dead, is inadequate as a tool either for understanding architecture in general or for articulating the experience one has of looking at the interior of Palladio's basilica in particular. What we have here is an avoidance of intelligible criticism dressed up as high theory. In the same chapter we learn that 'architectural monsters are built fantasies' (pp. 57-8). In the fifth and final chapter Marco Frascari discusses the relationship between drawings and the built form. He discusses both the architectural drawings required by the builder as instruction and the drawings of completed buildings which are held to fashion our conceptions of them. This is all interesting, and no doubt a good deal more could be said about the status of a diagram. Indeed Frascari introduces this topic rather well. 'Drawings, as semiotic tools and models of architectural representations, range from survey or measured drawings, which interpret the reality of the constructed world, to construction and design drawings, which are to be interpreted for the construction of the world. Together with the constructed world itself these drawings constitute the architectural project. The art of architecture is based on imaginative representation' (p. 90). If this were a work of aesthetics then we could expect an enquiry into the nature of interpretation; into the distinction between information retrieval (conceptual grasp) and experience (perceptual grasp). Instead, however, we are treated to a rehearsal ofC. S. Peirce's views on the importance oficonicity. I do not have a view on whether or not Peirce was right; the point is rather that we are entitled to expect some discussion of what it is to accept this view. ?

It is a work that belongs to enthusiastic theory and as such I can imagine it being read by, and often quoted by, architectural students. It has, if nothing else, an enormous range of citations; and these are mostly interesting. In the end one is left with the feeling that one has read a series of engaging but disorganized thoughts written by a congenial man absorbed in his subject. His subject being architecture, not philosophy. University of Westminster EDWARD WINTERS</page></plain_text>
