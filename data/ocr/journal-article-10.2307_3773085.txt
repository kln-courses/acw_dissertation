<plain_text><page sequence="1">Meaningful God Sets from a Chinese Personal Pantheon and a Hindu Personal Pantheon1 John M. Roberts University of Pittsburgh Chien Chiao Indiana University Triloki N. Pandey University of California, Santa Cruz The traditional Chinese and Hindu pantheons are large and complicated, comprising many gods and goddesses who have substantial personal his- tories and numerous personal attributes, and who occupy positions in com- plex networks. Within the traditional Chinese and Hindu cultures, these pantheons have been maintained and developed by advanced religious specialists who devoted their lives to their religions and were aided by extensive sacred literatures. Yet it is unlikely that even the most erudite specialist in either culture had enough informational control over the total system to be able to list the names of all of the gods in his pantheon- regional differentiation alone would have presented insurmountable prob- lems-and it is virtually certain that no such specialist could have listed all of the characteristics of all of the gods. The complete pantheon, then, was beyond the personal informational control of any single specialist, no matter how devout and energetic. The complete pantheon was stored in the larger cultural informational system.2 It is clear, however, that religious specialists, aided as they were by their sacred literatures, could deal with features of the pantheon in great depth. Within specific localities or contexts their information must have been extensive. The informed believer must also have known a great deal, but probably less than the best of the specialists. Yet, since the informed be- liever was, in a sense, the ultimate consumer in this religious system, he may well have been the support of the entire structure. How did the in- formed believer deal with a system of knowledge which was too large for his comprehension, but which, at least in part, had deep significance for him? The present paper is an exploratory attempt to deal with aspects of this problem. 121</page><page sequence="2">122 ETHNOLOGY It is unlikely that contemporary polytheistic religions will ever be under- stood in anthropological terms if no attempt is made to map the informa- tional control and belief of the informed believers in these religions. Cer- tainly the reconstructions of ancient polytheistic religions would profit from further understanding of the nature of beliefs held by individuals. At this writing the psychological rewards and costs involved in such re- ligious beliefs have not been assessed, but even at a lower level the descriptive facts of the situation have not been marshalled in ways relevant to the individual believer. Perhaps this ethnographic report on the knowledge and beliefs of a Chinese man and a Hindu man will be a beginning. This study can be placed in a number of anthropological contexts. First, it is an example of the newer ethnography in that quantitative techniques have been used as an aid in ethnographic description. A constant-sum ratio scaling technique was used in determining the positions of the gods on specific variables, and factor analyses were used in reducing the large correlational matrices to comprehensible proportions. No attempt was made, however, to compare the Chinese and Hindu findings in quantitative terms. Second, this report has its place in a more general inquiry into the nature of meaningful figure sets, which is now being conducted by the senior author.3 Third, since this investigation is based on operations with the names of gods, it is also an investigation of aspects of high-concordance linguistic codes. As a matter of fact, the scaling technique used in this research is identical with that used by Roberts, Strand, and Burmeister (I971) in a study of clothing terms. Admittedly other methods can be used in studying religious informational control and belief, but the use of elements from a high-concordance code makes it possible to elicit particularly fine-grained and accurate judgments from informants. The stable properties of high- concordance codes are considered when we make cultural historical in- ferences about the gods later in this paper. Finally, and most importantly, this study fits into an inquiry into the nature of expressive culture. The religious system in any society constitutes an important segment of the general expressive culture, but apart from a study of the evil eye (Roberts n.d.), this particular line of inquiry has been limited to topics which are more restricted and more manageable than religion, e.g., games,4 expressive travel,5 and expressive styles.6 This investiga- tion, however, follows the pattern of the earlier studies in dealing with a limited problem within a broad topical area. It should, however, open a new avenue to the study of polytheism from the expressive point of view. Many of the studies in expressive culture have dealt with cultural models in one way or another. Pantheons seem to be model social systems, and individual gods may also be viewed as model figures. Ethnographic reports of the sort presented here may set the stage for later studies of model involve- ment in this area of religious belief. THE RESEARCH A pantheon is the aggregate of gods found within a system of religious belief, and a personal pantheon is the aggregate of gods known to a single</page><page sequence="3">MEANINGFUL GOD SETS 123 believer. The outer limit of a personal pantheon is defined by the believer's ability to recognize a god's name when it is called to his attention, but it is more practical to restrict the concept of the personal pantheon to the collectivity of gods whose names the believer can recall at will, whose characteristics he knows, and whose relationship with other gods he can specify. If this definition is used, it is clear that every personal pantheon is much smaller and less complex than the full pantheon to which it belongs. The set of gods comprising a personal pantheon, however, contains one important sub-set. This is the set of gods who are particularly meaningful for the believer in the sense that they have personal significance and salience for him, but not necessarily in the sense that he loves or treasures them. The average Christian of a fundamentalist persuasion loves Jesus and abhors the Devil, but both figures are meaningful to him. Meaningful gods may be strong or weak, good or bad, interesting or uninteresting, but they must have personal significance for the believer. The set of mean- ingful gods, therefore, constitutes the core of each personal pantheon. Opera- tions designed to provide information on the nature of this core will ultimately illuminate the understanding of the entire personal pantheon. This report describes the meaningful god set found in the two personal pantheons possessed by a Chinese informant and a Hindu informant. The Chinese informant was particularly well known to the second author and the Hindu informant was equally well known to the third author. Both informants were intelligent, well educated men who lived in the United States, but who maintained close ties with their families in their home- lands. Each informant came from a family of orientation which had high status in his traditional culture. Each provided responses which were more representative of the standard "great" tradition in religion than they were of "little" traditions. Each man, for example, had read extensively in his own sacred literature. The Chinese informant provided the most information, but the Hindu informant, a Brahman, probably had a deeper level of belief in his own religion. Both were well motivated and conscientious in their work. The two informants had large personal pantheons. The Chinese informant was able to list approximately 6o gods whose characteristics he knew, and the Hindu informant knew more than ioo gods. When the meaningful god sets were elicited, these numbers were sharply reduced. The Chinese informant listed fifteen gods after the attribute of "meaningfulness" had been very carefully defined. The Hindu informant initially listed a few more than fifteen gods, but he stated that the first fifteen in his list constituted a defensible set, so his meaningful god set was restricted to fifteen as well. The Chinese informant used 25 variables in scaling the gods. The variables were: personal involvement (hsing-yang cheng-tu), estimated father's involvement (fu-ching hsing-yang cheng-tu), responsiveness (ling), motherly image (mu-ching hsing-hsiang), capability (neng), fearfulness (Q'utng-pu), masculinity (nan-hsing), fatherly image (fi-ching hsing- hsiang), administrative power (chih chian), humorousness (hua-chi), ap-</page><page sequence="4">I24 ETHNOLOGY proachableness (ping-i), fairness (cheng-chih), emperor's image (ti-wang hsiang), wisdom (tsung-ming), interest (yu-ch'u), chancellor's image (tsai- hsiang hsiang), strangeness (kuai), badness (ngo), capriciousness (wu- ch'ang), unworldliness (ch'ao-fan), parochial power (hsia chuan), luckiness (fu-ch'i), omnipotent power (fa-li), reverence (chuang-yen), and good- ness (shan). The Chinese transcriptions are given because the Chinese ex- pressions were used in the scaling. Only the Chinese names of gods were used. The Hindu informant used twenty variables in scaling the fifteen gods in his meaningful god set. These variables were: personal involvement (vyatigata dsthd), responsiveness (phaladdyak, uttaraddi), devotion (bhakti), reverence (pujya), interesting (lagdva), estimated father's involvement (pita ki dstha), approachableness (prapya, sulabha), goodness (achchhai), fatherly image (pitdtulya), prime minister's image (pradhdn mantri swa- rupa), king's image (rjad-rupa), motherly image (mdtri swarupa), mas- culinity (purusatva), wisdom (buddhi), fear (bhaya), badness (burai), luck (bhdgyashali), humorousness (vinoda), capriciousness (aisthiratd), and power (sakti, teja). Once again the Hindi transcriptions are given be- cause the informant only used Hindu concepts and god names in his scaling. The scales merit some discussion. Obviously some of them were derived from scholarly concerns stemming from western culture. The three dimen- sions of potency, evaluation, and activity developed by Osgood (Osgood et al 1957) were represented in this study by the variables of omnipotent power (Chinese) and power (Hindu), goodness and badness, and interesting. These dimensions were introduced to provide some cross-cultural compara- bility. Personal involvement, of course, is nothing more than a rank order of the gods in the set. The estimated father's involvement was used as a measure of cultural integration since it was known that both informants were particularly close to their fathers. The emperor's image, king's image, chancellor's image, and prime minister's image variables served to introduce a bureaucratic element, whereas the fatherly and motherly images provide a kin element. It was known that the bureaucratic element was appropriate for the Chinese system and the kin element was suited to the Hindu sys- tem, but the same variables were used for both systems to provide com- parability. The Chinese informant had a taxonomy of power, which he divided into omnipotent power (e.g., a supreme being), ruling power (e.g., an emperor), administrative power (e.g., a chancellor), and parochial power (e.g., a sheriff). The need for the other variables is essentially self- evident. The humorousness variable, for example, was included because of the anthropological interest in trickster figures. Some variables emerged from discussion with informants. In scaling the fifteen gods on any variable, each informant used a constant- sum ratio scale technique of the sort which has been described technically by Torgerson (I958: 108-II2) and which has already been used in other research (Roberts, Strand, and Burmeister 1971; Myers and Roberts I968). Each informant considered pairs of gods which were developed first by arranging the names of gods in random order and then by matching the</page><page sequence="5">MEANINGFUL GOD SETS 125 first god in the sequence with the next god, and then the first with the third and so on. The sequence was then repeated with the subsequent gods. Each informant made a total of o05 paired comparisons each time he scaled the gods in terms of some variable. In making each comparison the in- formant divided Ioo hypothetical "votes" between the two gods. If power were the variable and if he thought, for example, that one god was vastly more powerful than another, he might give the first god 99 power votes and the other god one power vote. On the other hand, if he thought that the gods were equal in power, he would give each god 50 power votes. After the judging was finished, the geometric mean was computed for the fifteen ratios listed under each god's name, and this became the scale value for the god for that variable. A second value, called contrast, was found at the same time by taking the geometric mean of the absolute values of the logarithm for each ratio and by determining the antilog of this number. This value requires a word of explanation. If there are two ratios of 50/50 and 50/50, the geometric mean is one and if there are two ratios of 99/I and 1/99, the geometric mean is also one. In the latter case, however, the informant distinguished sharply between the two possibilities while in the former case he did not. It is ethnographically useful to know the degree to which an informant displayed contrast in his judgments, because the lower the contrast, the greater the uncertainty or ambiguity and in all probability the higher the curiosity. The Chinese informant made 2,625 paired comparisons and the Hindu informant made 2,I00 paired comparisons. The work, however, was so divided into small sub-tasks that no informant worked for more than two hours in a single session. The constant-sum ratio scales were computed and then factor analyzed using a modified Bio-Med program developed by Gunn (I974). All opera- tions were based on numbers with three decimal places; but in order to save space in the tables which follow the scale, values are only given to two decimal places and the contrast values are only given to one decimal place. THE CHINESE MEANINGFUL GOD SET The fifteen most meaningful gods for the Chinese informant were, in order of his personal involvement in them, the following: (I) Kuan Yin, Goddess of Mercy; (2) A Mi T'o Fo, Buddha of Brightness; (3) Ju Lai, the Buddha; (4) T'u Ti, the Village God; (5) Yen Wang, the King of Hell; (6) Yu Huan Ta Ti, the Jade Emperor; (7) Tsao Chiin, the Kitchen God; (8) Kuan Ti, the God of War; (9) Ts'ai Shen, the God of Wealth; (Io) Shou Hsing Kung, the God of Longevity; (ii) Wu Ch'ang, the Messenger of Death; (12) Huang Ti, the Yellow Emperor; (I3) Ch'eng Huang, the City God; (14) Lung Wang, the Dragon King; and (15) Wen Ch'ang, the God of Literature. The Chinese informant provided brief descriptions of the gods in his meaningful god set. He grouped them under the categories of Ruling Gods,</page><page sequence="6">I26 ETHNOLOGY Ministerial Gods, Parochial Gods, Buddhist Gods, and Ethical Figures. Edited versions of his descriptions of each god appear below. Ruling Gods Three gods were placed in the category of Ruling Gods and each was considered the counterpart of the emperor of imperial China. These gods rule in heaven, beneath the sea, and in hell, respectively. They are powerful, unapproachable, and commanding of reverence. Yu Huan Ta Ti or the Jade Emperor is a Taoist god who is supposed to be the ruler of heaven, but his importance in Chinese folk belief does not match his title, perhaps because of the competition with the powerful and popular Buddhist high gods. Although he is revered by many Chinese, he is remote and unapproachable. Since he is seldom represented in art, people do not usually have a clear image of him. Lung Wang or the Dragon King is the ruler of the sea. Since he controls the weather, especially rain, he is important in rural areas. He appears in the form of a dragon, particularly when he makes rain, but he appears as a human figure as well. His temple is one of the more popular temples. There are numerous folk tales about his colorful life and elaborate palace beneath the sea. Yen Wang or the King of Hell is the Chinese version of the Hindu God of Death or Yama. Although the Chinese accepted this Hindu deity arid the concept of hell, they reinterpreted the role of Yen Wang and the structure of hell in terms of a model of their own bureaucratic system on earth. Yen Wang is an extremely powerful god, more powerful than either the Jade Emperor or the Dragon King; he controls death and rewards or punishes people after death according to their deeds on earth. Because he controls reincarnation (another Hindu concept accepted by the Chinese), he also controls birth. Ministerial Gods The three gods in this group were once historical figures who became cultural heroes after their deaths and who, much later, were deified. They are considered to be a rough equivalent of the high ministers in the tradi- tional Chinese bureaucracy. Kuan Ti or the God of War was once a famous general of the Shu State (A.D. 221-263), which was one of the three independent kingdoms existing at the end of the Han dynasty. His real name was Kuan Yu. He did not become a cultural hero and god until a thousand years after his death, and this change was largely effected through stories about the three king- doms, especially "The Romance of Three Kingdoms" by Lo Kuang-chung (fourteenth century). Ts'ai Shen or the God of Wealth was also a great general. His real name was probably Chao Kung-ming, and he is referred to as Marshall Chao, as in Mao Tse-tung's (1967: I5) famous article "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," written in 1926. According to legend, he was deified in the Ch'in dynasty (221-207 B.C.). He is believed to have control over the</page><page sequence="7">MEANINGFUL GOD SETS 127 distribution of worldly wealth. His portrait is considered a symbol of good fortune, and it is usually pasted on the door to the house or on the wall facing the entrance. Wen Ch'ang or the God of Literature was once a minister in the Tsin dynasty (A.D. 265-420) named Chang Ya. After his death, he was wor- shipped as a god by the Taoists who held that he was assigned by the Jade Emperor to be in charge of the star Wen Ch'ang. This is where all records of the nature and rank of the offices which can be obtained by scholars on earth are stored. He is not, however, an important god even to scholars. Since office was one of the main sources of prestige and wealth in traditional China, Wen Ch'ang, like Ts'ai Shen, has been regarded as a lucky symbol. Parochial Gods The gods in this group are closely identified with localities. They are not powerful, but they are highly approachable, lovable, or humorous. The City, Village, and Kitchen Gods, however, were important and non-local in ancient times, and it was only in later dynasties that they gradually became localized and powerless. Ch'eng Huang or the City God was an ancient Chinese deity who was believed to be the guardian spirit of the city. He was one of the eight gods annually worshipped by the emperor of the Chou dynasty (iiii- 256 B.C.). In later dynasties, the name of Ch'eng Huang was given to the guardian spirits of cities of various ranks, so that the imperial capital, the provincial capitals, and the county seats were guarded by Ch'eng Huang. Thus, almost every Chinese city has a temple for its Ch'eng Huang, who is also believed to be the local agent of Yen Wang or the King of Hell. Inside the temple, one also finds minor gods from hell, such as Wu Ch'ang, the Messenger of Death. T'u Ti or the Village God was originally the God of Earth (t'u ti means "earth"), and he is more ancient than the City God. The ceremony for T'u Ti was an important annual event for the emperors of the Shang (175I- 112 B.C.) and Chou dynasties. In modern times, however, he has become the mere guardian spirit of the village, a position roughly equivalent to the village head in the Chinese bureaucracy on earth. He is a familiar figure to the villagers and his statue is often seen in obscure corners of the temple or inside a small shrine in a field or along the roadside. He is friendly and easy going; people consider him to be dependable and approach- able, although they know that his power is limited as he is only the local agent of other more powerful gods. Tsao Chun or the Kitchen God is generally believed to be the god of the family: his name literally means "the gentleman in the kitchen." A popular theory holds that he was originally the God of Fire, although this is often disputed. In any case, he is seldom represented by a statue or a portrait. Instead, there is a piece of paper with his name written on it, and on both sides of his name it often reads: "When you ascend to heaven, please report only nice things about us [to the Jade Emperor, presumably]. When you come down to earth, please bring us peace." He is, therefore, believed</page><page sequence="8">128 ETHNOLOGY to be the Jade Emperor's spy in the family, and the protector of the family, at one and the same time. Wu Ch'ang or the Messenger of Death has a name which means "tran- sient," and he is a Chinese personification of the Indian view that "life is transient," according to Lu Hsun's (1956: 380) 1926 study. He is usually sent by the King of Hell to summon the spirits of those who have exhausted their days on earth. He is a familiar figure in rural areas where his image can be found in various kinds of temples, especially those of the City Gods. He is often impersonated in folk operas and village festivals. To the villagers, he is a personable and approachable intermediary between this world and hell; or according to Lu Hsun (1956:384), he is "ghostly yet human, just yet merciful, frightening yet lovable." Buddhist Gods The three gods in this group are the most popular Buddhist deities ac- cepted by the Chinese. They are believed to be omnipotent, benevolent, and more responsive than the traditional Chinese high gods. Ju Lai or the Buddha was the founder of Buddhism. Originally, of course, he was the Prince Gautama (553?-483? B.C.) of the gakyas in northern India. In the Chinese mind, he is an omnipotent and benevolent god, the highest of the Buddhist deities. His statue is widely displayed. To many people, however, he is more remote and less approachable than the other two gods in this group. Kuan Yin or the Goddess of Mercy, the female version of the Indian god, Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, is probably the most popular deity in China. She is believed to be a goddess of sympathy, kindness, and mercy. This belief is indicated by her name, which means "the one who observes signs of suffering." Her thousand-armed and-eyed statue or portrait suggests her infinite helping and periscopic observing power. The Chinese informant stated that he was most involved with Kuan Yin. In this he was influenced by his late father, who was a true believer in Kuan Yin. He also liked the short, common prayer to her: "Hail Bodhisattvas Kuan Yin, great mercy and great compassion." A Mi T'o Fo, or the Buddha of Brightness, is the Indian god Amitabha Buddha. According to the Amitabha Classic, he is the Buddha in charge of the land of "ultimate happiness" in the west, and if one can keep repeating "Na Mo A Mi T'o Fo [Hail Amitabha Buddha]" with great concentration, he can travel directly to this land after physical death. This simple method of salvation and the belief in A Mi T'o Fo led to the creation of a very popular Buddhist sect known as the Pure Land Sect, and A Mi T'o Fo has become one of the most popular gods in China. Ethical Figures The informant felt that two of the gods in his meaningful god set did not receive the same sort of religious feeling as that directed toward the other thirteen gods. These gods seemed to be more symbols of value than proper gods.</page><page sequence="9">MEANINGFUL GOD SETS 129 Huang Ti or the Yellow Emperor is believed to be the common ancestor of all Han Chinese. The informant believed that he identified with him more than did other Han Chinese because, according to legend, his own surname is directly derived from the Yellow Emperor's clan. Shou Hsing Kung or the God of Longevity has a name which means "the Old Man on the Star of Longevity." He is believed to have the power to extend man's life span. THE CHINESE SCALES The scale values for each of the fifteen Chinese gods on each of the 25 variables are presented in Tables I, 2, and 3. The contrast values for each of the scale values are presented at the same time. The columns of Tables I, 2, and 3 present a profile for each god on the 25 variables. The rows, which are the same in the three tables, provide the data needed for an interval scaling of the gods in terms of the variables. The gods have been listed from left to right in terms of their scale values on the personal in- volvement scale, so the first row of Tables I, 2, and 3 lists the gods in scale order, but this is not true of the other rows. Since these are interval scales, each scale can be plotted against any other scale. The contrast figure should not be ignored. Yen Wang, for example, was given a scale value of .50 for goodness and a contrast value of 2.0. This means that the informant was very discriminating in making his goodness judgments. On the other hand, he was less certain, to judge from the con- trast values, in deciding about Yen Wang's responsiveness, humorousness, and capriciousness. All in all, Tables I, 2, and 3 constitute the basic statement on a Chinese meaningful god set. The same can be said for Tables 7, 8, and 9, which constitute a similar statement for the Hindu god set. In Tables I, 2, and 3 the variables (i.e., the rows) are clearly not of equal weight or importance and they differ in their relevance to an assess- ment of the gods. The gods, on the other hand, can be treated as units of the same sort. Space does not permit the reproduction of the correlational matrices, but it should be noted that the correlation between personal involvement and estimated father's involvement is -94. No one knows how the Chinese informant's father would actually have scaled these gods, but it is clear that the informant thinks that his father would have scaled them in virtually the same way as far as personal involvement is concerned. This high correlation must be a measure of integration and probable concordance if the in- formant's judgment is to be trusted. When the correlational matrix was factor analyzed, there were four fac- tors which accounted for 89.6 per cent of the variance. In Table 4 the rotated factor matrix (verimax rotation) for the 25 Chinese variables is presented.7 Factor I, a humane factor, is defined by loadings on the following variables: personal involvement, estimated father's involvement, responsive- ness, motherly image, capability, goodness, omnipotent power, wisdom, and negative fatherly image.

THE HINDU MEANINGFUL GOD SET8 The fifteen most meaningful gods for the Hindu informant, in order of his personal involvement in them, were the following: (i) Hanuman, the Monkey God; (2) Sarasvati, Goddess of Learning; (3) Shiva, God of De- struction; (4) Vishnu, God of Preservation; (5) Krishna, a culture hero; (6) Rama, a culture hero; (7) Lakshmi, Goddess of Fortune; (8) Ganesh, an auspicious god; Remover of Obstacles; (9) Brahma, God of Creation; (Io) Durga, Goddess of Destruction; (ii) Sita, Goddess of Purity; (12) Indra, King of Gods and Ruler of Heaven; (13) Radha, Goddess of Suc- cess and Happiness; (I4) Parvati, Goddess of Mercy; and (I5) Yama, God of Death. The Hindu informant grouped the gods and goddesses named above under two categories: the Vedic and the Puranic deities. Under the Vedic group he included Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra, Yama, Sarasvati, and IV</page><page sequence="15">MEANINGFUL GOD SETS 135 Table 6: Rotated Factor Matrix for the Fifteen Chinese Gods Based On the Contrast Values for Twenty-five scales.

Lakshmi. Parvati, Durga, Sita, Rama, Radha, Krishna, Hanuman, and Ganesh constitute the Puranic group. In the Vedic category there are mostly "Aryan" gods and their consorts. Brahma, the God of Creation, is married to his own daughter Sarasvati, the Goddess of Learning and Wisdom. In the Hindu cosmology his birth is traced to Brahmanda, the cosmic egg, born of the Supreme Absolute. In some of the Puranas it is mentioned that Brahma, becoming a boar, raised the earth and created the world, the sages, and the lords of progeny (Danielou I964: 236). Vishnu is the God of Preservation and he pervades everything, owns everything. From his navel sprouts the lotus flower on which Brahma is seated. His wife, Lakshmi, is the Goddess of Wealth and Bliss. Mother Earth is also one of his wives and Kama, the Cupid of the Hindu pantheon, is his son. At times Vishnu incarnates himself as a par- ticular avatar in order to guide the evolution and destiny of the different orders of creation. Shiva, the destroyer, is associated with the malignant and the mysterious in nature. He is considered a moody god, easily pleased</page><page sequence="16">136 ETHNOLOGY and easily angered. His great cosmic dance, Tdndava, typifies the ordered movement of the universe. He is also the God of Regeneration and Sexuality and his consort, Parvati, is hailed as the personification of primeval energy. Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva constitute the Hindu "trinity" and are dominant figures of the Hindu pantheon. Indra is the King of Gods and the Ruler of Heaven. He is thought of as the embodiment of power and courage and is occasionally associated with Vishnu in the Vedas. Yama is the God of Death and the Keeper of the Law. He rewards or punishes people after death according to their karmas. Durga, the Goddess of De- struction, is the consort of Shiva. She is the opposite of gentle Parvati, who is considered the Goddess of Mercy, embodying the powers of procreation and development. Shiva and Yama, with Durga and Yami as their con- sorts, controlled the world of the departed souls during Vedic time and later came to control the world of vegetation as well (Bhattacharji 1970: 129). Ganesh, the elephant-headed auspicious god, is one of the two sons of Shiva and Parvati. He is also known as Ganapati, the Lord of Categories. He is Remover of Obstacles and is worshipped for success and prosperity. As the first among the great, he presides over the assembly of the gods. He is worshipped at the beginning of every enterprise and his image is seen at the entrance of every house and sanctuary. He is associated with Kuber, the God of Treasures and the Protector of Travelers. Although named indirectly in the Vedas and in Upanishads, Ganesh appears in his present form only with the Mahdbhdrata. The gods of the Puranic group were once historical figures who became culture heroes after their deaths and were deified later. They are treated as models for social behavior by believers, and the Hindu informant reported several events from his life illustrating the roles these gods played in his socialization. Rama is the incarnation of Vishnu and was born as the son of King Dasaratha of Kosala, a kingdom in North India. His purpose was to destroy the demon king Ravana of Lanka (Sri Lanka, formerly Ceylon) who was tyrannizing the fourteen worlds of the Hindu universe. The dramatic fulfillment of this mission, described in the Rdmdyana, one of the greatest epics, came about after Ravana abducted Rama's consort, Sita; and Rama, with the monkey hordes under Hanuman of the southern kingdom of Kishkindha, crossed over to Lanka and burnt it to ashes. Every year dramas called Ram Lila, based upon the Ramayana, are attended by mil- lions of people (Hein 1959). Rama is believed to be an ideal for every man, and his kingdom, Ram Raj, remains a model for the republic in India. His consort, Sita, is thought of as the embodiment of purity and womanly virtues. Hanuman, the monkey-headed God, is the ideal devotee, bhakta, of Rama. He is one of the most popular gods of North India and his idol is found in every village and city. He is highly approachable and is believed to grant every wish of a devotee with a loving heart. He was the patron god, Istadevatd, of the Hindu informant's father.</page><page sequence="17">MEANINGFUL GOD SETS 137 Perhaps the most colorful of all the Vishnu incarnations is Krishna, the god brought up among cowherds of Braj just south of Delhi. He is remem- bered as the mischievous child, the endearing lover and favorite of the milkmaids of Mathura, "the eternal paradox of flesh and spirit" (Ingalls I966: v) His consort, Radha, is considered the embodiment of success and happiness. Krishna came primarily to slay the tyrant, Kansa, his own uncle. But he is best remembered for the support he gave to the five Pandava princes, who had been cheated of their kingdom by their hundred cousins, the Kauravas. The great battle fought at Kurukshetra to the north of Delhi, described in the epic Mahdbhdrata, ended in the utter defeat and extermina- tion of the Kauravas. The discourse Krishna gave to Arjuna, the Pandava archer prince, is enshrined in the Bhagavad Gita, the divine song of the Hindu scriptures. Krishna's sermon on the path of man's duty and the regulation of his thoughts and actions is the cream of Hindu philosophy and is venerated as the spoken words of God. The episodes from the life of Rama and Krishna, both culture heroes but so different from one another, are cited by people in order to express their own spiritual and material experiences and aspirations. They both symbolize and inspire the people's lives by mobilizing and channelling their vital energy. THE HINDU SCALES The scale values for each of the Hindu gods on each of the twenty Hindu variables are presented in Tables 7, 8, and 9 below. These tables are identical in structure with those pertaining to the Chinese gods. The columns present a profile for each god on the twenty variables. The rows of the three tables present the scaled values for the variables. There was a high correlation between personal involvement and esti- mated father's involvement, although the correlation of .77 was not so high as that of the Chinese informant. Thus a high level of cultural integration obtained here as well. When the correlational matrix was factor analyzed, four factors account- ing for 85.8 per cent of the variance were found (see Table io). Factor I appears to be an involvement factor with positive loadings on personal in- volvement, responsiveness, devotion, reverence, interest, estimated father's involvement, approachability, goodness, wisdom, and luck, and with a negative loading on capriciousness. Factor II seems to be a fatherly authority factor with positive loadings on fatherly image, prime minister's image, king's image, masculinity, wisdom, and power, and with a negative load- ing on motherly image. Factor III may be a fortune factor with positive load- ings on luck, goodness, and approachability, and with negative loadings on fear and badness. Finally, Factor IV may be an unpredictable power factor with positive loadings on humorousness, capriciousness, and power. THE HINDU GODS The fifteen gods can be grouped into four factors which account for 92.6 per cent of the variance. The factor analysis is presented in Table II.</page><page sequence="18">i38 ETHNOLOGY Table 7: Scale and Contrast Values for the Hindu Gods Variables Hanuman Sara- Shiva Vishnu Krishna svati (Monkey) (Learn- (Destruc- (Preser- (Culture ing) tion) vation) Hero) S C S C S C S C S C 1 Personal involvement 1.69 1.7 1.68 1.7 1.43 1.5 1.21 1.4 1.15 1.4 2 Responsiveness 1.56 1.6 1.48 1.5 1.40 1.5 1.38 1.5 1.15 1.4 3 Devotion 1.83 1.8 2.13 2.1 1.44 1.6 1.79 1.9 1.54 1.8 4 Reverence 1.64 1.6 2.09 2.1 1.44 1.5 1.39 1.5 1.35 1.5 5 Interest 1.36 1.4 1.10 1.3 1.33 1.3 1.24 1.3 1.22 1.3 6 Father's Involvement 2.02 2.0 1.54 1.6 1.26 1.4 1.15 1.5 1.07 1.5 7 Approachability 1.37 1.4 1.70 1.7 1.31 1.5 1.20 1.3 1.23 1.4 8 Goodness 1.26 1.3 1.45 1.5 0.98 1.4 1.42 1.4 1.19 1.2 9 Fatherly Image 2.16 3.4 0.32 4.3 3.08 3.1 3.93 3.9 2.50 2.8 10 Prime Minist.

This factor is defined by posi- tive loadings on Indra, Rama, Vishnu, Krishna, Shiva, and Brahma, and by negative loadings on Durga, Lakshmi, and Sarasvati. The second factor seems to represent a beneficent female factor for it is characterized by nega- tive loadings on Sita, Radha, Parvati, Lakshmi, and Sarasvati. The third factor is difficult to define as it is characterized by positive loadings on Hanuman, Ganesh, and Brahma. It seems to represent an alternate line to the classical gods of the Hindu pantheon. Factor IV is clearly a death and destruction factor, for it is defined by positive loadings on Yama and Durga and by a negative loading on Sarasvati. As in the Chinese instance, the matter of contrast is of some importance. Yama, by the way, had such a high contrast value that it was arbitrarily reduced to 9.99. Table 12 presents the analysis.

In any event, there are essentially two lines of discrimination. THE CHINESE AND HINDU MEANINGFUL GOD SETS Some comparisons between the two god sets can be made. The fact that the two meaningful god sets are similar in size has already received com- ment. Male and female figures appear in both sets. Each set has at least one figure who in some manifestation is not clearly anthropomorphic, e.g., the Dragon King and the Monkey God. Both sets contain gods who had once been culture heroes, and both contain gods known to have entered their respective pantheons at different periods in history. Moreover, there are specific similarities on a superficial level, for both have a king of the gods, a deity of knowledge, a god of wealth, a goddess of mercy, a king of hell, and possibly a god of happiness. Other comparative statements could be made. 8 Ganesh (Auspi- cious) S C 0.96 1.3 0.71 1.6 0.94 1.7 0.86 1.6 0.86 1.3 0.80 1.5 1.15 1.2 1.14 1.3 1.27 3.4 .1.09 2.2 0.73 4.0 0.63 2.3 3.12 3.6 0.89 1.2 0.63 1.6 0.94 1.3 2.28 2.3 1.00 1.3 0.92 1.2 0.69 1.5 9 Brahma (Creation) S C 0.84 1.3 0.93 1.4 1.15 1.6 1.13 1.4 0.87 1.3 0.85 1.5 1.09 1.7 0.98 1.3 3.06 3.2 1.65 2.0 1.37 1.8 0.46 2.3 3.55 3.6 1.27 1.3 0.88 1.3 0.86 1.2 1.23 1.6 0.85 1.3 0.84 1.2 1.14 1.4 10 Durga (Destruc- tion) S C 0.83 1.5 0.67 1.6 0.44 2.4 0.54 2.0 0.97 1.3 1.76 1.8 0.52 2.0 0.69 1.5 0.21 4.7 0.66 1.6 0.65 1.8 1.84 2.0 0.24 4.6 0.85 1.2 1.58 1.8 1.37 1.7 0.57 3.2 1.03 1.3 1.34 1.5 1.10 1.4</page><page sequence="20">140 ETHNOLOGY Table 9: Scale and Contrast Values for the Hindu Gods Variables 11 Sita (Purity) S C 12 Indra (King of Gods) S C 13 Radha (Success) S C 14 Parvati (Mercy) S C 1 Personal Involvement 2 Responsiveness 3 Devotion 4 Reverence 5 Interest 6 Father's Involvement 7 Approachability 8 Goodness 9 Fatherly Image 10 Prime Minist.

Each dis- tinguished between male and female deities, but the import of this distinc- tion seems to be different in the two sets. The Chinese set contains a sin- gle goddess whose factor loadings placed her third on the transcendental factor, twelfth on the achievement and supernatural factors, and eleventh on the cultural identity factor. It is true that she is first on the personal involvement scale, but it is difficult to assert that the difference between male and female constitutes an important principle here. The Hindu set contains six goddesses whose average factor loadings differ significantly from those of the gods in the case of three factors and directionally from those of the gods on the fourth factor. The gods have a mean loading of .607 on the Vedic factor while the goddesses have a mean loading of -.386 on the same factor(t - 7.048, p &lt; .o00). The gods and goddesses have average loadings of -.260 and .753 respectively on the beneficent female factor (t = Io.576, p &lt; .ooI), and average loadings of .437 and -.169 respectively on the alternate line factor (t = 5.657, p &lt; .ooI).

Evidently the male and female divisions have true personal meaning for the Hindu in- formant. There are other classifications as well. The Chinese informant divided the fifteen gods into five groups: Buddhist Gods, Ruling Gods, Ministerial Gods, Parochial Gods, and Ethical Figures. The loadings on the four factors were used in one-way analyses of variance and in each instance the results were significant. Thus, average loadings on the transcendental factor are: Buddhist (.741), Ethical (.087), Ruling (.073), Ministerial (.oi5), and Parochial (-.562), and the one-way analysis of variance is significant (F = 24.005, p &lt; .ooo0005).

The supernatural factor loadings are: Ruling (.761), Ministerial (.133), Buddhist (-.147), Ethical (-.222), and Parochial (-.305); and the one-way analysis of variance is significant (F - 5.15I, p &lt; .02). Finally, the average loadings on the cultural identity factors are: Ethical (.622), Ministerial (.274), Ruling (.127), Buddhist (-.o8I), and Parochial (-.326). The one-way analysis of variance is significant (F = 6.460, p &lt; .oi). The informant's classification, then, also has personal mean- ing and significance. The Hindu informant grouped his gods and goddesses into Vedic and Puranic categories (later he placed Brahma and Sarasvati into a Pre- Puranic category). The one-way analyses of variance for the loadings in the four factors were non-significant with both the two group and the three group classifications. These groupings have scholarly importance, but they seem to have little significance for the informant in personal terms. It is quite a different situation, however, with the color coding of the gods. The Hindu informant said that Lakshmi, Sita, Sarasvati, and Parvati were "fair." Brahma was red or pink. Shiva was silver. Vishnu and Radha were dark blue. Rama and Krishna were light blue and blue respectively. Ganesh was pink. Hanuman, Indra, Yama, and Durga were black. Further- more, he said that it was legitimate to combine the various blue colors into a single blue class and to group the red, pink, and silver colors into a mixed class. The resulting four color classes and the factor loadings were</page><page sequence="23">MEANINGFUL GOD SETS 143 Table 12: Rotated Factor Matrix for the Fifteen Hindu Gods Based On the Contrast Values for Twenty Scales.

The results were directional for the alternate line factor (p &lt; .io). Clearly the color coding of the gods reflect groupings which have deep personal meaning for the informant. Color did not mean as much to the Chinese informant, but he did group his gods into three categories: light (Kuan Yin, Ju Lai, A Mi T'o Fo, Shou Hsin Kung), intermediate (Kuan Ti, T'u Ti, Huang Ti, Tsao Chiin, Yu Huan Ta Ti, Ts'ai Shen, Wen Ch'ang), and dark (Yen Wang, Lung Wang, Cheng Huang, and Wu Ch'ang). Once again the color classes and the factor loadings were used in one-way analyses of variance which were significant for the transcendental factor (light .595, intermediate -.076, dark --.358, F = 9.184, p &lt; .005) and the achievement factor (light -.406, intermediate .393, dark .121, F = 4.818, p &lt; .05).</page><page sequence="24">I44 ETHNOLOGY In addition to the foregoing classifications there must be other groupings of interest. The factor analyses suggest that each informant had a set of gods representing orthodox authority and that each had powerful alterna- tives to these orthodox figures. Again each seemed to have an achievement and an anti-achievement set of gods. Each had gods symbolizing his own cultural identity in the larger sense, but each also had a deity of wisdom to symbolize his own scholarly identity as well. Future work will probably show that there are other classifications of interest. THE CULTURE-HISTORICAL DIMENSION It may be possible to base culture-historical inferences on the data pro- vided by living informants on meaningful god sets. If god nomenclatures are stable, high-concordance codes, they are probably resistant to decay and to penetration by other codes. When they do collapse in the presence of strong forces for change, they may disappear altogether; but if elements from these codes survive, they might well cohere albeit in a distorted or changed way, rather than becoming random elements in the new code. If this hypothesis about the clustering of god names can be supported, it should be possible to establish rules for the survival, loss, and addition of names in the nomenclatures of these complex pantheons. This hypothesis cannot be tested here, but the data do admit some speculation about it. Four of the Chinese gods came from India: Ju Lai, A Mi T'o Fo, Kuan Yin, and Yen Wang. Wu Ch'ang is not included in the list as his provenience is less certain. The average factor loadings for the two groups differed sig- nificantly for the transcendental factor (Buddhist, .523, Others -.I52, t 2.689, p &lt; .05) and the achievement factor (Buddhist -.I99, Others .227, t = 1.963, p &lt; .05). The Buddhist gods, then, constitute an Indian cluster here, and when the factors or scales are plotted against each other, this can often be seen to be the case. The Chinese gods can be divided into three groups: an ancient group including T'u Ti and Tsao Chiin, a recent group containing the four Buddhist gods, and a traditional group containing the other gods save Wu Ch'ang. Wu Ch'ang represents a problem. The results are significant if he is classed with the Buddhist gods, but his position on the various plots suggests that he ought to be grouped with the ancient gods. Since this section is highly speculative in any case, he has been assigned (perhaps erroneously) to the ancient category. The ancient group, then, may be the surviving members from one or more early systems, the Buddhist group are elements from the Indian system, and the traditional group includes gods derived from one or more additional systems. When these groups and the factor loadings are used in one-way analyses of variance, there are significant results for the transcendental factor (Ancient -.132, Traditional .015, Buddhist .523, F = II.985, p &lt; .002), the achievement factor (Ancient - .238, Traditional .390, Buddhist -.I99, F - 3.625, p &lt; .o6), and the cultural identity factor (Ancient -.426, Traditional .32I, Buddhist -.097, F = 12.608, p &lt; .002). Since both the achievement and the cultural identity factors seem to be more Chinese in</page><page sequence="25">MEANINGFUL GOD SETS 145 culture, the traditional group seems to be less foreign than the other two groups. If these clusters of gods represent different systems in interaction, some intimations of the dynamics of change can be found in the scale data. First, the scales define four orders of power: first order (omnipotent power), second order (ruling power, i.e., the emperor's image), third order (ministerial power, i.e., the chancellor's image), and fourth order (parochial power). The use of the three groups and the scale values for the four variables in one-way analyses of variance showed that first order power is dominated by the Buddhist group (Ancient .607, Traditional I.ooi, Buddhist 1.515, F = I8.970, p &lt; .0005); second order power is divided between the Traditional and Buddhist groups (Ancient .413, Traditional 1.409, Buddhist 1.218, F = 2.839, p &lt; .io); third order power is con- trolled by the Traditional group (Ancient .657, Traditional 1.370, Buddhist .848, F - 5-54I, P &lt; .02); and fourth order power is commanded by the Ancient group (Ancient 1.620, Traditional .933, Buddhist .950, F - 5.646, p &lt; .02). Thus the intrusive Buddhist gods are high in the orders of power, the traditional gods are intermediate, and the ancient gods are low. As time progresses, gods seem to move downward through the orders of power. Yet, as the ancient gods lost power, they may have gained in approach- ableness (Ancient 1.823, Traditional .9II, Buddhist .823, F - I8.907, p &lt; .0005). At the same time an increase in capriciousness may have been tolerated (Ancient 1.593, Traditional .964, Buddhist .820, F IO1.3I, p &lt; .005). While the results attributed here to the movements of clusters or groups of gods may well be explained on some other basis, there is the possibility that as the milennia pass the gods move through semantic space in orderly ways. As the older gods fail to deliver, newer gods have appeal, but the older gods can survive by falling back to lesser power positions and by becoming approachable and responsive. Their inadequacies at these lower levels may be explained on the basis of weak capriciouness. The Hindu case is too complicated to be given here. Operations with the Hindu data have yielded culture-historical hypotheses: the gods with the color coding of black, for example, seem to be representatives of a different and older system; but further work must be done before speculations of the sort offered for the Chinese case can be made. The limitations of working with single cases must be recognized and the line of inquiry outlined in this section is hypothetical at best. It is in- triguing, however, to think that it may be possible to use living heads in a form of cultural archeology. If the rules of change in high-concordance codes can be formulated, such a cultural stratigraphy might be developed. DISCUSSION Meaningful god sets appear to be symbolic small-group networks, with believers ordering their thoughts about their gods in terms of a relatively small number of major dimensions. Since they seem to have few mem- bers, it is probably the case that every god within this limited number must</page><page sequence="26">I46 ETHNOLOGY carry his full religious and psycho-cultural weight. The functions of any particular god may be relatively discrete, for there seems to be low re- dundancy in the system. Theoretically, each god should stand first on one or more scales of significance, but this hypothesis has yet to be tested. The relationships among the gods within the networks must be examined. The bureaucratic characteristics of the Chinese pantheon have been noted before, but even this single meaningful god set resembles a bureaucracy. The Hindu meaningful god set, on the other hand, resembles a family or kin network. There are other and more abstract connections between these gods, however, and these should be mapped. The relationship between the believer and the gods in his meaningful god set must be studied. Does he pray or otherwise relate to them more than to other deities? Under what conditions does he relate to them? These and other questions must be answered. It would be interesting to know how meaningful god sets are acquired by children and how the sets differ between men and women in the same culture. When believers become agents of diffusion are they most likely to disseminate knowledge about the gods in their personal meaningful god sets? When a believer becomes converted to another system, does he preserve the psychological structure of his meaningful god set by simply replacing old gods with new ones? Are meaningful god sets stable through adult life? Plainly there is much to be learned about meaningful god sets. Meaningful god sets, of course, are only a class of meaningful figure sets. The senior author is currently conducting work with various mean- ingful figure sets to study the ways in which people use these sets to struc- ture and preserve values, expressive attitudes, and various ideas. The under- standing of the dynamics of meaningful figure sets will aid the further study of meaningful god sets. This, in turn, will lead to a better understand- ing of the management of complex informational systems by individuals and groups. To date, however, it can only be said that the meaningful god sets of a Chinese informant and a Hindu informant were elicited. These gods were then described in conventional terms and mapped on various scales. Factor analysis was used to reduce the scale data to manageable proportions. Some comparisons and some interpretations were made. Outlines were suggested for future research. For the present the case for the ethnographic utility of the meaningful god set must rest on this treatment. Hopefully it is a sound one. NOTES i.

This concern with informational control and management has been manifest in earlier publications: Roberts (I961; I964), Chiao (1971), and Nerlove, Roberts, Klein, Yarbrough, and Habicht (I974). 3. The inquiry began some years ago with studies of roles in American and Chinese plays and now it has been extended to meaningful sets of kinsmen, community leaders, politicians, Japanese gods, saints, sports heroes, and others. 4. cf.

The analyses reported in this paper are principal components analyses (the diagonal entries in the correlational matrix are equal to one). The analyses dealing with the variables, rather than those dealing with the gods, are less certain because of the type of correlational matrices on which they are based, but they have enough ex- ploratory value and face validity to justify their inclusion in this paper. 8. The present paper places the greater emphasis on the Chinese meaningful god set, but another paper is in preparation which will deal with the Hindu personal pantheon in much greater detail. 9. Space limitations prevent the presentation of the numerous analysis of variance tables for this paper. BIBLIOGRAPHY Bhattacharji, S. I970.
