Depinet Denton ATD, Inc. Jason D. Jenkins and Virginia L. Waiters Transportation Research Center Inc. Copyright © 2007 SAE International ABSTRACT Lab-to-lab differences have become a very important consideration in the verification testing of Hybrid III 5th Female necks in user labs. It has been observed that a neck certified by one laboratory does not always pass the same certification test in a different lab. This has led the Anthropomorphic test device Certification Research group (ACR) to investigate the precision of the test procedure in relation to the test specification corridors. This study adapts an industry recognized ASTM procedure to measure the precision of the SAE neck calibration laboratory test procedure in Engineering Aid 25 [1]. The ASTM procedure is ASTM E 691-99 "Standard Practice for Conducting an Interlaboratory Study to Determine the Precision of a Test Method" [2], This paper details how the ASTM procedure was adapted and presents the results of the ASTM E 691 statistical analysis procedures. INTRODUCTION In 2004, the ACR group decided to study variability on the 5th Female Hybrid III Neck Calibration. After reviewing a previous study conducted by a SAE Task Group of the Dummy Testing Equipment Subcommittee (DTES), "Hybrid III Dummy Neck Round-Robin Testing" [3], the group decided to focus on different equipment as a source for potentially large lab to lab variation in neck rotation measurements during the calibration process. That study focused on rotation measurement potentiometers. A series of tests were run in one lab with three different types of rotary displacement potentiometers. The data was compiled and statistically analyzed, and although some variation could be contributed to the different types of potentiometers, the variation was quite small compared to observed differences. The results of that study can be found in the following SAE paper: 2005-01-0303 "Hybrid III 5th Female Neck Test Rotation Measurement" [4], In a continuing effort to reduce the lab to lab variation for the 5th Female Neck Calibration procedure, the ACR group decided to look at the test procedure itself. We decided to apply an ASTM standard that measures the precision of a test method, ASTM E 691-99 "Standard Practice for Conducting an Interlaboratory Study to Determine the Precision of a Test Method" [2], This standard lays out the methodology for conducting an interlaboratory study. It assumes that tests performed on presumably identical materials in presumably identical circumstances do not yield identical results. This is because of unavoidable random errors inherent to every test procedure. NECK TESTS This ASTM standard gives guidelines for conducting an interlaboratory study to determine the precision of a test method and can be broken down into three main parts. 1) planning the interlaboratory study, 2) guiding the testing phase of the study, and 3) analyzing the test result data. We will look at each of these steps in this paper. PLANNING THE INTERLABORATORY STUDY The ASTM standard requires that a task group be put together for performance of the study. The ACR group became the task group. The task group has responsibility for developing the test procedure and the funding required for the study. An ILS (Interlaboratory Study) Coordinator was also appointed to supervise, coordinate, and distribute all of the necessary protocol and materials to the participating labs. This responsibility was appointed to TRC personnel. The responsibility of Statistician/Data Analyst was assigned to Denton ATD personnel. 1139</page><page sequence="2">Also in the test planning phase, the basic test design and test method of the study was decided upon. We tried to keep the test design as simple as possible to get the information required. One of the biggest challenges in adapting the ASTM standard to neck testing is that the ASTM standard requires homogenous test samples for this procedure and is geared toward testing where each sample is only used for one test. It has been observed that Hybrid III necks can have a lot of variability in them. They are very complex parts, and are constructed with a combination of formed rubber and metal parts making it difficult to get a homogeneous group of samples. Given these constraints, the ACR group decided on testing three necks from three different manufacturers that demonstrated property ranges, one on the high end of the neck rotation corridor, one on the low end of the neck rotation corridor, and one in the middle of the neck rotation corridor. We did this to try to introduce as much variability as possible. This test series was setup as a round-robin type of test series. Three different necks were tested at nine different laboratories. Per the ASTM E 691-99 standard, a final statement of precision of a test method must be based on data from at least 6 laboratories. This means that you must start with at least 8 laboratories to allow for attrition. This requirement was met by our study. Each neck was tested six times at each laboratory. Once each neck was tested at all labs, it was returned to the first lab and then tested again so we could check for degradation of each neck during the testing series. There was also discussion as to whether we should use all six tests from each lab in the analysis, or throw out the first test as a "warm-up" and just use the subsequent five tests. There are mixed opinions in the industry as to whether a warm-up test should be conducted prior to testing. In a previous study, "Hybrid III Dummy Neck Round-Robin Testing" [3], a warm-up test was run, and the data from the warm-up test was not used in the analysis. Since the neck calibration procedure does not address this issue, and does not call for a warm-up test, we analyzed the data both ways, but the conclusions of this paper are based on using all six tests and using the degradation corrected data. All of the data including the corrected and uncorrected can be found in the appendices. The following is a list of laboratories that participated in the study in a randomized order: Denton ATD, Daimler Chrysler, First Technology Safety Systems, Vehicle Research and Testing Center, Transportation Research Center Inc., MGA Research Corporation, General Motors Corporation, Ford Motor Company, and Honda R&amp;D Americas, Inc. Each laboratory was assigned a letter for anonymous identification in the data tables. The three necks rotated through the labs in an independently randomized order as shown in Appendix A. We decided for the test methodology, to simply follow the SAE Engineering Aid 25[1]1 test procedure. Each laboratory was given the following instructions for testing the necks. 1 ) The necks were to be tested in flexion and were to be performed following the test procedure. All tests were to be performed by laboratory personnel that were familiar with this test procedure. 2) In addition to the required measurements from the test procedure, all laboratories were to collect the following additional measurements: Peak OC Moment, Peak Fx force, and Peak My moment. 3) Each test was required to have passing input parameters (velocity and impact pulse). Tests which fail velocity or impact pulse must be repeated. A failure that is only in a neck response parameter does not require a retest. Each test should be treated as an independent run and should not use the history results to influence how the next test is performed (with the exception of a failing input parameter). 4) Each lab is to torque the neck cable as they normally would for the 1st of the six tests. For subsequent tests, each lab is to follow their usual practice for retesting: whether it is leaving the cable alone or retorqueing. 5) Each lab must keep the nodding blocks installed Front (F) and Rear (R) as marked. Other than the nodding blocks, each lab will provide its own accessory parts for neck testing. 6) Each Lab was to use normal laboratory instrumentation for each test and record the results in a spreadsheet that was provided. The data collected included an impact velocity measurement, the pendulum accelerometer, two rotary potentiometers for neck rotational measurement and two neck load cell channels: the Y-axis moment and the X- axis force. The filtered neck responses that were analyzed included: 1 SAE Engineering Aid 25 test procedure is being used instead of CFR Part 572 [5] because the two procedures are currently the same and the SAE procedure would be easier to change in the future. Originally the ACR group asked the participants to follow the CFR Part 572 procedure, but changed it after the ILS had started. 1140</page><page sequence="3">• D-Plane rotation - calculated as a sum of the two rotary potentiometers • Peak moment about the occipital condyle (OC) - calculated per the formula in the procedure • Moment decay time to 10Nm for the OC moment • Peak X-axis force (Fx) • Peak Y-axis moment (My) The peak moment about OC was used in the analysis instead of the specified moment during interval because some labs may not have data during the interval due to the rotation not falling within the specified range. Thus the Peak moment about OC was used instead. GUIDING THE TEST PHASE OF STUDY Once the test method was defined, the test procedure, necks, and test schedules were sent to all the participating labs, and the testing began. The only hardware sent to the laboratories were the necks and nodding blocks which were labeled front and rear. Everything else required for the testing was provided by the labs. All of the testing occurred between October 11th, 2005 and March 21st, 2006. We regularly followed up with individual labs to make sure the testing was on schedule, and we also collected all the data from the labs as the testing progressed. ANALYZING THE TEST RESULT DATA The data analysis was completed in this study by using the ASTM E 691-99 "Standard Practice for Conducting an Interlaboratory Study to Determine the Precision of a Test Method" and the statistical techniques within this standard to determine the precision of the Hybrid III 5th Female Neck Flexion Test in terms of repeatability and reproducibility for all the required measurements. The data was also analyzed by using Minitab® Version 14 to determine if the neck degraded over time through the use of T-Test and regression analysis. ASTM E 691 Software was used to verify the calculations created in Microsoft Excel because the ASTM software was older than the 1999 ASTM E 691-99 regulation used. The response for each test parameter was collected and checked for degradation by performing T-Test comparisons between the initial run and test repeats at initial lab and regression analysis between the test results and the run order. The run order was the actual run order in which the necks were tested and only tests with passing input parameters were kept. If a test had a failing input or was conducted improperly, that run number was skipped. Figure 1 shows a starting run number of 11, this was due to a testing error which caused those tests to be omitted and the placeholder for the tests remains. A 95% confidence level was used to determine whether the results of the T-Tests and regression analysis were statistically significant. The data was then corrected by applying the regression equation. Only data sets for which the regression was statistically significant at 95% confidence level (P-Value ¿0.05) were corrected. Figure 1 shows an example of neck degradation before and after the data was corrected for one of the parameters studied. Figure 1 Regression Chart Corrected and Uncorrected Data Data points which were determined to be outliers were examined and corrected. In some cases the outlying points were unexplainable and were kept for the analysis. The first test of each test run was kept in the analysis rather than considering it a warm up because current test procedures do not recommend deleting it. In current everyday testing, if a lab experiences passing test results on a first test they would not discard it. In the precision statements for each test parameter, we looked at what the results would be if the first test was eliminated. As seen in Appendix J, the effect of eliminating the first test would be small. TEST RESULTS The T-Tests were performed on the first run and the repeat run on all three necks at the initial labs. These tests determined there were statistical differences which may be caused by neck degradation. The results are summarized in Table 1 with statistically significant values (p-values ¿0.05) in bold. Neck A was statistically significant for Peak Moment about OC and Peak Moment My. Neck B was statistically significant for all test parameters. Neck C was statistically significant for D-Plane Rotation, Moment Decay and Peak Moment about My. Box plots of all test parameters used in the T- Test analysis are located in Appendix B. 1141</page><page sequence="4">Neck A Neck B Neck C Estimate Estimate Estimate of of of P-Value Difference P-Value Difference P-Value Difference D-Plane Rotation 0.141 0.001 2.91 0.007 2.55 Peak Moment About OC 0.028 2.7 0.009 1.85 0.137 Moment Decay to 10Nm 0.836 0.001 1.46 0.007 0.87 Peak Force FX 0.48 0.001 24.1 0.439 Peak Moment MY 0.01 3.8 0.037 1.47 0.032 0.87 Table 1 T-Test Summary The T-Tests only indicated there were differences between the initial first run and the repeat run in initial first labs, however, these differences may or may not have been attributed to neck degradation. It could also be due to the difference in testing between the times of the initial and repeat runs. The data was further analyzed to determine if degradation occurred by performing regression analyses. Regression analyses on D-Plane Rotation, Peak Moment about Occipital Condyle (OC), Moment Decay to 10Nm, Peak Force Fx and Peak Moment My were performed. By checking for P-Values of &lt;0.05 it was determined at a 95% confidence level there were statistically significant test parameters.

The Peak Moment about OC and Peak Moment My were not statistically significant. Appendix C shows all the regression analysis for Neck A. Neck B regression analysis showed statistical significance D-Plane Rotation, Peak Moment about OC, and Peak Moment My. The Peak Force Fx and Moment Decay to 10Nm were not statistically significant. Appendix D shows all the Regression Analysis for Neck B. Neck C regression analysis showed statistical significance for Peak Moment about OC and for Peak Moment My. The D-Plane Rotation, Peak Force Fx and Moment Decay to 10Nm were not statistically significant. Appendix E shows all of the regression results for neck C. The results from the regression analysis of the three necks would suggest Neck A and Neck B show statistically significant degradation for D-Plane rotation even though Neck A's T-Test analysis was not statistically significant. Neck C now shows no statistical significance even though the T-Test analyses show statistically significant degradation. The R2^ values on all test parameters are low which suggests only a small part of the test variation is explained by the regression analysis. Data correction based on applying the slope of the regression equation was applied to all the statistically significant data values. Figure 1 shows an example of a data channel before and after correction with regression lines showing the slope. The ASTM E 691-99 standard was used to analyze the uncorrected and corrected data from all necks and tests. For simplification the corrected data was added to the data tables in Appendix F as a new test parameter "corrected". The ASTM E 691-99 standard states the analysis and treatment of the test results have three purposes: • To determine whether the collected data is adequately consistent to form the basis for a test method precision statement • To investigate and act on any data considered to be inconsistent • To obtain the precision statistics on which the precision statement can be used. To determine the consistency of the data, all the data was organized on a worksheet displaying all the test data from all participating labs from all parameters. On the worksheets the following statistics were created by using the associated equations as stated in the ASTM E 691-99 standard. Cell Statistics • Cell Averages EQ(1) • Cell Standard Deviations EQ(2) Intermediate Statistics • Average of Cell Averages EQ(3) • Cell Deviations EQ(4) • Standard Deviation of Cell Averages EQ(6) Precision Statistics • Repeatability Standard Deviation EQ(7) • Reproducibility Standard Deviation EQ(8) Consistency Statistics, h and k • Between Laboratory Statistic (h) EQ(9) • With-in Laboratory Statistic (k) EQ(10) Tables showing the results of the consistence statistics on each Neck are located in Appendix F. Bar graphs and tables were created to summarize the h and k values with critical levels displayed to give an idea 1142</page><page sequence="5">of the overall variability of the test method as well as determining if any laboratory or cells should be investigated. These graphs and tables are shown in Appendix G, Appendix H, and Appendix I. The h-value graphs were evaluated to determine whether any laboratory should be investigated if they exhibit the following patterns. The first two patterns are normal occurrences and illustrates the variability of the test method and does not require investigation, however the last two patterns with substantially high h-values would require laboratory investigation. • Laboratories having both positive and negative h-values among materials • Equal number of positive and negative laboratories • One laboratory with all negative h-values as opposed to all other labs being positive or vise versa. • Low property levels are of one sign and the high property levels are of the opposite when occurring within one lab. The k-value graphs were evaluated to determine if any one laboratory should be investigated. Labs with high k- values represent with-in laboratory imprecision and very small k-values may indicate an insensitive measurement scale or measurement problem [2]. Thus the data was examined for the following pattern. • Any laboratory having large k-values or small values The h and k graphs were first plotted by laboratory and were determined to contain outliers by having values near the critical values. To further analyze these outliers, the h and k graphs were reorganized by materials to determine if they were reasonably consistent with other labs. If one material showed consistently high values by all labs, then the h and k values may be reasonable. However, if one lab is strongly different than others, then this lab should be investigated. All labs which were determined to be outliers were investigated at this point. Initially some labs were determined to have clerical errors and were corrected. Other labs were considered reasonable because of no clerical, sampling, or procedural errors could be found and the h and k values were not too extreme. In this study there was no data determined to be outliers that was discarded. All data collected was considered reasonable. Figure 2 and Figure 3 (for D-Plane Rotation) shows an example of outlying data in that Lab H has an h value exceeding the critical limit. This was considered an outlier and through investigation of the h-value graph by material, confirms that for Material C laboratory H had an inconsistent data point. However, after interviewing the lab in question and reviewing the data, nothing seemed out of the ordinary and the data point was kept. Similar instances of outliers existed for other test parameters and were investigated in the same way. Figure 2: h Statistic Graph by Laboratory Figure 3: h Statistic Graph by Material The k-value statistic bar graphs show which labs have inconsistent data. These graphs are also plotted by laboratory and by material. Similar to the h value analysis, the k value first looks at the individual lab and if a critical value was exceeded then the k value graph by material was looked at to determine if the value was reasonable. In Figure 4 (for D-Plane Rotation) laboratory H and I have a k value exceeding the critical limit. Further review on the k value graph by material (Figure 5) indicated the data from these two labs should be investigated. After determining there were no clerical, sampling, or procedural errors, the data points were kept. All the graphs and tables showing the h-value and k-value statistics are located in Appendix G, Appendix H, and Appendix I. 1143</page><page sequence="6">Figure 4: k Statistic Graph by Laboratory Figure 5: k Statistic Graph by Material The ACR group reviewed all the h and k statistics from all the test parameters and took this information to create the needed precision statistics as required by the ASTM E 691-99 standard. In general, the ASTM precision statement is one which states the 95% repeatability and reproducibility limits for each neck. These limits were calculated by following the equations set forth in the ASTM standard. • Repeatability limit EQ(1 1 ) • Reproducibility limit EQ(12) The following tables (3 to 5) were determined by ASTM to be a useful format for the presentation of the precision of a test method. Within these tables are the following statistics: • Average • Repeatability Standard Deviation (Sr) • Reproducibility Standard Deviation (SR) • Repeatability 95% Limit (r) • Reproducibility 95% Limit (R) The Average is the average of cell averages for a given neck parameter. The Repeatability Standard Deviation deals with the within laboratory variability and is the square root of the average within laboratory variance. The Reproducibility Standard Deviation deals with the between laboratory variability and is the sum of the within laboratory variance and the between laboratory variance of the laboratory means. And when the Reproducibility Standard Deviation calculates to less than the Repeatability Standard Deviation, the Reproducibility Standard Deviation is set equal to the Repeatability Standard Deviation. The Repeatability Limit is 2.8 times Repeatability Standard Deviation giving the 95% probability limit. The Reproducibility Limit is 2.8 times the Reproducibility Standard Deviation giving the 95% probability limit. The 2.8 multiplier is the number of standard deviations needed to capture 95% of the test variation. Precision statements are given here for each of the standard test parameters for the corrected data. The Precision Statements for all test parameters are shown in Appendix J.

GR&amp;R are regularly used in manufacturing environments to evaluate the adequacy of gages 1144</page><page sequence="7">compared to the overall manufacturing variation or the tolerances used for checking parts. From "The Black Belt Memory Jogger" [6], the typical acceptance criteria for a GR&amp;R is when 5.15 * total measurement system variance divided by the tolerance and converted to a percentage by multiplying by 100 equals the following: • Marginally Accepted &lt;30% • Good &lt;20% • Excellent &lt;10% The 5.15 multiplier is the number of standard deviations needed to capture 99% of the variation. Since ASTM E691-99 uses a multiplier of 2.8 to capture 95% of the test variability for comparing lab precision, we decided to use this same factor instead of the more stringent 5.15 multiplier normally used to evaluate GR&amp;R's. From the precision statements, a summary of how the current test corridors match up with the 95% Repeatability and Reproducibility limits can be made as shown in Table 6. The Repeatability and Reproducibility percent of test corridors is created by taking the 95% limit and dividing it by the difference of the maximum and minimum test corridor and converting to a percentage by multiplying by 100. Neck A Lower Upper Repeatability (r) % Reproducibility (R) Corridor Corridor of Test Corridor % of Test Corridor D-Plane Rotation 77 91 18J 46.5 Peak Moment about OC 69 83 27J 101.1 Moment Decay to 10Nm 80 100 8.6 24.3 Neck B Lower Upper Repeatability (r) % Reproducibility (R) Corridor Corridor of Test Corridor % of Test Corridor D-Plane Rotation 77 91 26 A 52.0 Peak Moment about OC 69 83 26.3 52.6 Moment Decay to 10Nm 80 100 9.0 30.4 Neck C Lower Upper Repeatability (r) % Reproducibility (R) Corridor Corridor of Test Corridor % of Test Corridor D-Plane Rotation 77 91 27.4 51.7 Peak Moment about OC 69 83 28.3 74.3 Moment Decay to 10Nm 80 100 13.7 38.0 Table 6 Summary of Precision Comparing the % of Test Corridor shown in Table 6, it can be seen that the current test is seriously inadequate when compared to the corridors. To be even marginally acceptable, all percentages must be below 30%. There are two solutions to fix this variation. One solution would be to increase the corridor widths to accommodate the lab to lab variation that we see. To have good (&lt;20%) test corridors, they would need to be as follows: D-Plane Rotation: 65.8 to 102.2 deg Moment about OC: 40.6 to 1 1 1 .4 Nm Moment Decay to 10 Nm: 71 to 109 ms The other solution to the test variation is to find the sources of the test variation and eliminate them to reduce the variation to acceptable levels. We think that this is the proper solution in this case. Increasing the corridors as shown above would lead to unacceptably wide corridors. By looking at Table 3, Table 4, Table 5 and Table 6 it is easily seen that the majority of the variation is due to Reproducibility variation. This same conclusion that there is a lab to lab repeatability problem can be seen qualitatively by examining the regression plots which list tests in order by lab. On each graph each set of 6 consecutive tests were done in one lab. To clearly see this, Figure 6 has been modified to show a circle around each individual laboratory for D-Plane Rotation for neck A. This figure displays a variety of circles above and below the regression line. This study is only aimed at proposing a method to quantify the precision of this test using the ASTM E691- 99 method. No attempt has been made to determine the sources of the variation which were shown. We did collect some information from labs on the surveys that will be used in follow up work to try to determine the sources of variation. Further, an examination of the precision statements in Appendix J from this study seems to indicate that requiring a warm-up test would decrease the variation somewhat. This is especially true for within lab repeatability. Additional work to confirm this is necessary. The data in this study was not sufficient to draw a firm conclusion because not all labs had a true warm-up test included in their data. Some additional discussion is needed about the analyses which were done to examine neck degradation. Since the possibility of degradation has always been a concern when doing round robin testing of necks, we did testing to examine this issue. First, we did T-test comparisons between initial and repeat tests in the initial lab for each neck. These tests showed statistically significant changes to the neck. We also did regression analyses of the test parameters on each neck to look for a trend in the data which would indicate degradation. Both methods showed statistically significant differences in data. However, the two methods identified different parameters as having changed. The question should be asked: why didn't they identify the same parameters as being statistically significant? We think the answer to this all stems from the large overall test variation that we see in this study. Taking the T-test first, these tests show differences between initial and repeat tests in one lab. Does this indicate neck degradation? It could. However, it could just as easily indicate a difference in testing in the labs over the 1145</page><page sequence="8">course of several months that passed between the initial and final tests were done. This might also indicate that the lab to lab variations that are seen might not be consistent between labs. It might be that each lab experiences a similar variation over the course of several months. The within lab repeatability measured by ASTM E691-99 is a variability that occurs in a short period of time in each lab. In this study, all of the testing in one lab on one neck occurred within a few days or up to two weeks at the most. It is possible that this variation in each lab would be much larger with multiple technicians and over the course of many months. However, we do see the variation in multiple labs, technicians, and months all contained in the reproducibility precision. So, this should give a good picture of overall test variation, whereas the repeatability precision should not be relied upon for a long term variation in any individual lab. The next question is whether the regression analyses actually quantify degradation of the necks over the course of the test series. An examination of the R2(adj) values which range from 7 to 51% show that only a small percentage of the variation in the study was explained by the regression analyses. This leaves open the possibility that the apparent trends are more related to lab order than actual changes in the neck. Even though that is possible, we consider it more likely that the changes are actual changes in the necks over the course of the study. That is why we decided to use these regression equations to correct the data before determining final precision tables. Our decision was partly based on past experience which led to a concern for degradation, and partly due to the fact that the regression trends correspond with the types of changes that would be expected with neck degradation. However, even if this is an incorrect assumption, the application of the regression correction values would not affect the conclusions of this paper. Appendix J shows precision statistics with and without correction for probable degradation. The correction lowered the variability quantified by the precision statistics, but not radically. If it was an incorrect assumption to correct the data, then the variation is actually worse than what is presented, which shows an even greater need for reducing variation. It does not change the conclusions. If the variation can be greatly reduced, a follow up study using this regression method should be able to determine with much greater confidence whether neck degradation has occurred and correct for it. Figure 6 D-Plane Rotation vs Run Order with Individual Labs Noted 1146</page><page sequence="9">CONCLUSION By using the ASTM E691-99 standard, we successfully created Precision Statements showing Repeatability and Reproducibility. From these values in this study we are able to quickly see that the majority of the test variation is coming from lab to lab reproducibility variation.. The within-lab repeatability variation for all standard test parameters of this test method was marginally acceptable (&lt;30% of tolerance) but should be significantly reduced to get to good (&lt;20%) or excellent (&lt;10%) levels. The between lab reproducibility variation for all standard test parameters of this test method was not acceptable. This lab to lab variation needs radically reduced to get to at least marginally acceptable levels (&lt;30% of tolerance) or better yet to good (&lt;20%) or excellent (&lt;10%) levels. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to thank the following laboratories for their participation in this study: Denton ATD, Daimler Chrysler, First Technology Safety Systems, Vehicle Research and Testing Center, Transportation Research Center Inc., MGA Research Corporation, General Motors Corporation, Ford Motor Company, and Honda R&amp;D Americas, Inc. We would also like to thank Denton ATD and First Technology Safety systems for providing the dummy necks for this study. FUTURE WORK Future work for this study will be to determine the sources of variation through the use of statistical analysis tools and ultimately creating a revised test procedure which either eliminates or controls the amount of overall variability. This ASTM study will then be repeated using the newly revised procedures to prove the test variation seen in this study was reduced and satisfactory repeatability and reproducibility precision are obtained.
