<plain_text><page sequence="1">Moulard, Barbara L. Within the Underworld Sky: Mimbres Ceramic Art in Context. Photographs by John Bigelow Taylor. Pasadena: Twelve Trees Press, 1984. xxviii + 159 pp. Plates, maps, illustrations, notes, bibliography. This book contains 100 high quality photographs of vessels depicting Classic Mimbres Black-on-white (plates 1-54), Mimbres Boldface Black-on- white (plate 55), Hohokam decorated ceramics (plates 56-65), Anasazi decorated ceramics (plates 66-80), Casa Grandes ceramics (plates 81-92), and Salado ceramics (plates 93-100). The plates are preceded by a foreward by Lee Anne Wilson and 18 pages of text by Barbara Moulard placing the Mimbres ceramics, primarily the Mimbres Classic Black-on-white pottery which is typified by figurative designs, into context. The plates are followed by detailed descriptions and discussions of each vessel by plate number. I found these plate descriptions very informative and they were well used by Moulard in developing her thoughts on influences on Mimbres pottery color and decoration. The text</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 65 by Moulard and the plate descriptions are amply footnoted. The book has a handsome dust jacket of a Mimbres Classic Black-on-white bowl. In size and general appearance the book has the feel of a coffee table style volume. While the shortened treatment of the subject could have been elaborated considerably, nevertheless Moulard introduces a refreshing and, I believe, an important new concept to interpreting the Mimbres iconography and to con- sidering southwestern iconography in general within a scientific context. Perhaps Moulard is able to take this step because she is not an archaeologist but rather is an art historian. This is telling in her presentation of the prehistory of the Southwest, postulated relationships between groups in the Southwest, and even in dating of events. These are not so much incorrect as they are unidimensional. Moulard simply does not have the background in southwestern archaeology to synthesize Mimbres ceramics in its prehistoric context in as balanced a view as this archaeologist reviewer would have preferred. This misses the point of Moulard's major contribution in this book and should not overly detract from its significance. Moulard has taken a new perspective in looking at Mimbres. Instead of looking at the designs and attempting to compare them to similar designs in other cultures, especially the modern Pueblo groups, Moulard takes what she calls the contextual approach. Simply translated, she notes that most or all of the Mimbres bowls were found associated with burials, in particular inverted over the face of the deceased. Thus her point of departure in the study of Mimbres Classic Black-on-white is that the hemispherical bowl was intended as a funerary offering. Not only was it intended as a funerary offering, but the interpretation of its form and designs should be made within this context. Therefore, the geometric divisions of the bowl are interpreted, using analogues with modern Pueblo cosmology, as symbolic of vertical and horizontal divisions of the Mimbres world. The zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figures are personages or players in the underworld, the world of the dead. These beings, using the analogue of Pueblo cosmology, are paralleled in the living world. For years there has been speculation as to the purpose of the holes chipped or broken out of the bottom of the bowls placed over the head of the dead. Using the model she has developed, Moulard sees the hole as symbolic of the sipapu, or "spirit hole". In Pueblo culture the sipapu present in some of the kivas represents the hole through which the people of the underworld, which was then the living world, were able to reach the next level, or present world. Once in the present world, the underworld became the home of the dead. This underworld paralleled in every detail the living, except time was reversed. Thus winter in the underworld is summer in the present day and night is day. During some Pueblo rituals the sipapu is uncovered and the ancestor spirits briefly join the living to help conduct ceremonies and counsel initiates. The concept of the hemispherical bowl as representing the separation between spiritual worlds allows the hole in the bowl to be clearly conceived as a sipapu. Whether or not the interpretation of Mimbres ritual through Mimbres iconography as portrayed by Moulard is accurate is only part of the point this book makes. As in other aspects of archaeology and anthropology, this book demonstrates that other disciplines can enhance our ability to interpret other cultures, especially prehistoric ones. Moulard has demonstrated the utility of art history applied within an archaeological framework and cultural</page><page sequence="3">66 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, WINTER 1987 context as a worthy addition. Although Moulard's application of ethnographic analogy using Pueblo ritual to totally interpret Mimbres ritual is overzealous, the fact that prehistoric ceramics can be interpreted in wholly new ways should be significant to archaeologists. I only wish Moulard had considered other companion iconographic realms of the Mimbres, such as their rock art and assemblages of perishable artifacts recovered from the caves of the region, in her contextual evaluation of Mimbres iconography. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the Mimbres culture or interested in a fresh viewpoint for considering iconography in the archaeological realm. Arizona State Museum E.
