<plain_text><page sequence="1">KLEVE (K.) Gnosis theon: die Lehre von der natiirlichen Gotteserkenntnis in der epi- kureischen Theologie. (Symbolae Osloenses fasc. supplet. xix.) Oslo: Universitetsforlaget. 1963. Pp. 142. Price not stated. This study of the theology of Epicurus, or of one aspect of it, is planned as the first of three. Following the threefold division of the Epicurean system into Canonic, Physics, and Ethics, this study comes under the head of Canonic and asks simply how men acquire their knowledge of the gods. The inquiry is further restricted to men's 'natural knowledge', which is defined as that knowledge which can be attained without the help of philosophy. Part two, when it comes, will discuss the physical structure of the gods. The subject of the third part will be the consequences for life and happiness and for religious behaviour of the theological teaching. The rigorous logical consistency of the Epicurean system is now generally acknowledged. Basing him- self on this K. lays down three principles which the inquirer must not transgress: (I) Pleasure is the highest good; (2) no theory must contradict sense- experience; (3) atoms and void are the ultimate reality. These principles hold in every part of the doctrine and were maintained so long as the school survived. They must not be forgotten when we come to the main problem of this part of our inquiry, namely, the relation between the images (e'd6cta) which come to us from outside and the inner concepts (:rpo,3pet;g) which they occasion in us. Here K. claims that in spite of all that has been done by Philippson, Bailey, Diana and others something still remains to be said. It is here, so far as this part of his inquiry is concerned, that he hopes to make his contribution. The starting-point for this investigation is supplied by Cicero, De .Natura Deorum 1.44. Here the state- ment of Velleius, intellegi necesse est esse deos, quoniam insitas eorum vel potius innatas cognitiones habemus, has been a stumbling-block. De Witt (Epicurus and his</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES OF BOOKS 229 Philosophy, pp. 145 ff.), basing himself on this text, argued, disturbingly if not convincingly, that we must abandon our inveterate opinion of Epicurus as an empiricist and accept him for the intuitionist the well-instructed Cicero shows him to have been. It was easy to suspect that De Witt had interpreted these insitae vel potius innatae cognitiones with seventeenth- century eyes, not so easy to determine what precisely the words meant in their original Epicurean context. It is this context K. attempts, I think successfully, to restore. Anticipations (:rpoA?'etg) of the Gods cannot, he insists, be formed in the soul without an influx of images (es "doa). But equally certainly they cannot be formed in every kind of soul. Animals, for instance, do not have them. For the images of the gods are not perceptible by sense, but make their way directly into the mind. The gods, being made of smaller atoms and fewer atoms than sensible things, have a textura rara and emit images of a corresponding fineness which are incapable of stirring up the atoms of soul and producing sensations. Only those souls which are endowed also with the finer structure of mind can perceive the images of the gods. There is then both a subjective and objective element in the formation of the rpdo0'Antg of the divine being. It does not anticipate experience, but it is the response to experience of a particular constitution of soul. Neither is the full concept of the divine nature attain- able without an active effort of the mind. It is possible to receive the images of the gods and make a wrong use of them, as do those misguided philosophers who monstrously seek to unite the anthropomorphic images of the gods with the dead matter of the stars. To understand their true nature, their blessedness and immortality, special insight and special effort is required. But the victor will have his reward. Tum maximis voluptatibus in eas imagines mentem intentam infixamque nostram intellegentiam capere, quae sit et beata natura et aeterna (Cic. op. cit., 49). H. Diels extracted from the fragments of Philodemus On the gods an even more passionate passage: 'The wise man marvels at the nature and disposition of the gods, tries to draw near to them and yearns as it were to touch and mingle with them.' There is much more in this masterly study than I have been able to indicate in these few words. One eagerly awaits the completion of such a thorough and penetrating re-examination of the available evidence. B. FARRINGTON. Lymington.</page></plain_text>
