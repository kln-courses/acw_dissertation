<plain_text><page sequence="1">Toward an understanding of the muggu Threshold drawings in Hyderabad JYOTSNA S. KILAMBI Threshold drawings ? drawings executed on the ground ? are found, under different names and conditions, almost everywhere in India. In Andhra Pradesh the name given them is muggu. In Tamil Nadu and Kerala ? also in South India ? they are known as kolam. Rangoli in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and other states in North India, and alpona in Bengal, are among the better-known designations. The manner in which the drawings are executed in South India differs from their counterparts in the northern areas of the country. There are, however, some striking similarities, among them the fact that they are drawn exclusively by women.1 In addition, there are recurrent symbols in these drawings that cut across regional boundaries; perhaps, insofar as one can ever be certain of the relation between symbol and referent, their meaning too will be found to be consistent with that of similar drawings all over India. Still, the differences between the South and North Indian drawings should not be ignored. In South India, for example, they are drawn every morning, whereas in the North they are usually executed on festival or personally significant days ? marriage, the birth of a child, initiatory rites, housewarming, and so forth. The South Indian drawings are normally done with white rice or chalk powder, whereas those of the North are always colored. The former are usually geometric or floro-geometric, and the latter tend to be more obviously decorative and more iconographical in content. Even though formerly the South Indian drawings may have been depicted on the exterior walls of houses, or even in line tracings on the body, or on mortuary pottery (Layard 1937), in Hindu homes they are now almost exclusively executed on the thresholds. Rangoli patterns, however, tend to be drawn also in the interior of the house, on walls as well as on the floor. The almost exclusive location of the drawings in South India, specifically on I wish to thank Francesco Pellizzi for his comments, suggestions, and extensive editorial emendations, and Remo Guidieri for his much valued criticism and encouragement. 1. Drawings done and used by Hindu and Buddhist Tantrics will be considered later. the threshold, is intriguing, and we shall be centering our attention on this region. Every morning, before the sun rises, the woman of the house ? although in middle-class Hindu homes it is more often the servant woman ? is already up and about. The morning ablutions performed, she steps outside the house. Dipping her little pot (chembu) from time to time in an old bucket filled with a viscous m?lange of cowdung and water, she sprinkles the dry ground in front of the house ? the threshold, or the road to which the house directly gives. The water falls like a shower, so that it doesn't make puddles, and the ground gives off a clean, damp smell. The ground thus prepared, she bends, and with deft movements covers the threshold with a multitude of white points. Starting off from one point, her body turned always toward the east, she then circumvents and links the dotted infrastructure, raising her hand only when the muggu is finished. The tracing of the muggu thus precedes the other chores of the day. The main features of this ritual performance are: It takes place (theoretically) before or at sunrise. The ground on which the drawings are traced is purified. The threshold is the only place where the muggu are drawn. They are always drawn with white powder (these I term everyday muggu, in contrast to the richly colored ones that mark the festival of Sankr?nti between January 12 and 14). No attempt is made to preserve the drawings; they are almost immediately walked upon and become obliterated in the course of the day. Muggu ? the temporal aspect Is the muggu then a form of solar worship, of s?rya namask?r? The popular belief is that the muggu should be traced before sunrise, so that the first rays that fall on</page><page sequence="2">72 RES 10 AUTUMN 85 Threshold ground drawing (muggu) with floral motif. Hyderabad, Andra Pradesh, 1981. the consecrated spot will be carried toward the interior of the house by the early morning breeze. It would appear to be a synthesis of the vivifying power of the sun and the potency of the muggu itself. It is this combined force, doubly purificative, that penetrates into the house, charging the interior with its protective aura until the next morning, when the gesture will be reexecuted. An interesting mythological correlate of the muggu's being drawn at sunrise is the relation between S?vitr? and Savitr, two divinised forms of the sun ? the former female and the latter male. Maury suggests an inversion of the original functions of S?vitr? as symbol of the energizer of the universe. Following the Aryan advent and in accord with patriarchal Aryan conceptions, the powers of the goddess were apparently assigned to Savitr, including "control of the lunar elixir of life, now reinterpreted as solar energy.... Among other indications, the probability of S?rya's [a variation of S?vitr?] original identity as an archaic Indo-European sun-goddess seems reinforced by Slavonic mythology, which knows the three goddesses of Morning, Noon and Evening ? the phases of the sun's daily path ? by the name of Zoryas, an appellation evidently cognate with that of S?rya" (Maury 1969: 97). Although the possibility of actually proving this inversion of functions is remote, the interpretation of the muggu as a form of s?ry?-namask?r retains credibility: an ode, overtly to the sun god, but implicitly to his original feminine essence. In this perspective, there is a clear connection between women drawing the muggu, the time of day, and the extremely elaborate muggu of the Sankr?nti. Moreover, as will be seen later, the recurrent symbols in the threshold drawings force a reconsideration of the primordiality of the feminine essence in Hindu cosmological and metaphysical conceptions. The echoes are still manifest, despite the relegation of the Hindu woman to a tightly enclosed domestic space. Muggu ? purification The energetic and beneficial force of the sun's rays must have a receptive space, one that is purified. The Hindu conception of purity, as is well known, is linked closely with water and cowdung. The disdain and disgust aroused by human excrement (or even the merest drop of saliva!) contrast with the awe and respect inspired by everything relating to the bovine animal ? and particularly the sacred cow, go m?t?.</page><page sequence="3">Kilambi: Toward an understanding of the muggu 73 The following statement about the cow, by Mahatma Gandhi, can help one understand why even the excrement of the cow is valued. It reflects the deepest sentiments of most Hindus regarding that divine animal, which evokes such intense response even in recent and present times that a sage like the late Vinobha Bhave ? to mention a well-known personality ? undertook a fast unto death to ban cow slaughter. I yield to none in my worship of the cow. Cow protection is the gift of Hinduism to the world, and is one of the most wonderful phenomena in human evolution. Mother cow is in many ways better than the mother who gave us birth. Our mother gives us milk for a couple of years and then expects us to serve her when we grow up. Mother cow expects from us nothing but grass and grain. Our mother often falls ill and expects service from us. Mother cow rarely falls ill. Our mother when she dies means expenses of burial or cremation. Mother cow is as useful dead as when alive.2 (Gandhi 1963) The comparison of the human mother to mother cow was intended to stress the importance, in India, of all that issues from the cow. Historically, it appears that the cow occupied a less prominent place in the Indus Valley civilization, where it is likely to have been linked with the worship of the Mother Goddess. In the Vedic Period the bull takes a subordinate place to the cow,3 and although the bull continued to be slaughtered for sacrificial purposes, the cow was granted immunity even from sacrifice (Kosambi 1970). Cowdung is one of the five products (pa?ca gavya) recuperable from the cow; the others are milk, ghee (clarified butter), curds, and cow urine. The absolute purificative power attached to the excrement of the cow, and its indispensability to the preparation of the ground prior to its tracing, are yet another indication that the muggu is much more than mere "decorative" drawing. Cowdung is one component of the purificative process. Water is the other. Water is naturally cleansing, but it is well to remember its significance in Hindu metaphysics. Water, or more precisely, the cosmic waters, are considered to be a tangible manifestation of the divine energy that is m?y?, illusionary and real, creative and yet reabsorptive of its diverse manifestations. Zimmer gives a lyrical description of the Hindu equation of water with m?y?, here personalized as Visnu's divine energy: 2. He could have added "as useful when she defecates." 3. Despite Nahdi, and the frequency of the bull as epithet for gods like Indra, Agni, and R?dra, among others. Boundless and imperishable, the cosmic waters are at once the immaculate source of all things and the dreadful grave. Through a power of self-transformation, the energy of the abyss puts forth, or assumes, individualized forms endowed with temporary life and limited ego consciousness. For a time it nourishes and sustains these with a vivifying sap. Then it dissolves them again, without mercy or distinction, back into the anonymous energy out of which they arose. That is the work, the character of m?y?, the all-consuming, universal womb. (Zimmer 1974) Not only is the uterine connotation attributed to the cosmic waters an indication of its intrinsically feminine nature, but the serpent too ? a recurrent symbol in threshold drawings also often identified with earth and water ? is considered to evoke the Divine Female (Maury 1969:97). My emphasis on the Feminine Principle is, however, not meant to imply an opposition between male and female. It is meant only to keep us conscious of the importance given to the feminine essence in conceptualizing both cosmic and this-worldly reality. This could help to shed some light on the significance of the muggu and their authors, in terms of archetypal referents. It must be remembered that in a truly nondualistic perspective, there is no room for absolute oppositions; the male and female principles themselves should be viewed as a dynamic fusion of temporarily differentiated manifestations, a fusion that even obliterates the opposition itself.4 Not only does each man and each woman contain within himself/herself both male and female principles, but the conflict itself can be resolved within the individual's own being since the individual is a microcosm, an image and reflection of the whole universe. Muggu ? the spatial aspect As we have seen, one of the specificities of the ground drawings in South India is that they are invariably executed on the threshold of the house. Furthermore, the gesture of consecrating the entrance to the dwelling is repeated every morning. In North India, such drawings are also ? although not exclusively ? drawn on the threshold, but their daybreak recurrence is not quite as mandatory north of the Vindhyas as it is in the South. The question then arises: Why is the threshold so important in South India? And how should 4. Testified to by the profusion of androgynic representations in Hindu iconography, Siva-Ardhan?ri being one of them.</page><page sequence="4">74 RES 10 AUTUMN 85 Muggu with offering in its center. Hyderabad, 1981. one conceive of the importance of the entrance to the house, so that from the poorest hut to the richest mansion (excluding apartment blocks, for the moment) these magical drawings are so conscientiously executed in front of doorsteps? Like any other skill or necessity of life, architecture ? both domestic and public (temples, for example) ? has warranted attention and the laying down of precepts in the Hindu tradition. Architecture is classed as one of the crafts (silpa). It is specifically referred to as sth?patya, a science first revealed to mankind by Visvakarman (vi?va karman ? all-accomplishing), the architect of the universe referred to in the Rg-veda as the personification of the all-creative powers. A number of scholars, holding that the Vedic Aryans had acquired most of their construction skills from indigenous architectural lore, have traced early Hindu architectural conceptions to pre-Aryan times. Many elements can in fact be detected as already present in the pre-Aryan age, but any attempt to understand them must see them in context as a synthesis of Aryan and pre-Aryan conceptions.5 This is also the case for the importance of the threshold, both in temple and domestic architecture. The choice of the site for a temple is naturally a much more elaborate affair than for a domestic edifice, but the general conception behind the choosing of a site and the laying of the foundation stone are more surprisingly similar, remembering that there is no ready distinction between the sacred and the profane in India. Sacred and profane flow into one another, so to speak, as in the constant interplay between the temple and the family, 5. One should also bear in mind the influence of hellenistic and muslim architectural and aesthetic contributions to Indian architecture, which have been not only influential, but, in a certain sense, also decisive. between the publicly sacred and the privately sacred (as is the domestic altar, or even the threshold).6 If, as I was told, the threshold (at least theoretically) is supposed to rest on the place where the foundation stone had been laid, the importance of the entrance to the house becomes more transparent. Before the foundation stone is laid, the mason drives a wooden peg firmly into the ground, a coconut often serving as hammer. He is thus deemed to securely peg down the hood of the chthonian serpent ? usually referred to as Ananta or Sesa ? the cosmic serpent supporting the earth on its extended hoods, which at the same time also symbolizes the chaos below the surface of worldly order.7 The threshold is also of course the demarcation between the exterior and the interior of the house. The interior houses not only the kitchen (a source at once of purity and pollution) but also the domestic altar. The exterior, particularly in the bigger towns and cities, is also the area of the lessening of caste restrictions, where the still widely lamented mixing of castes occurs, and, consequently, whence the dangers of pollution are ever incumbent for the interior. Furthermore, human excretions, due to the scarcity of sanitary facilities, are frequently part of the very ground on which one walks ? hence the necessity to purify the area before the house against the uncleanliness that threatens its sacred interior. These same considerations are also given rather pragmatically by that skeptic Frenchman and great observer of India Abb? Dubois, but more in terms of a general purification of the house than with explicit reference to the threshold. The following passage illustrates the continuity of the tradition and shows the different levels at which the purification and decoration of a space can be understood. It also stresses the daily necessity of the ceremony, at least for upper-class families. Before the performance of the ceremony the place where it is to take place must be previously purified. This is usually 6. The building of a private dwelling necessitates the intervention of the astrologer and the priest, from the laying of the foundation stone to the first housewarming ceremony ? the latter accompanied by extremely elaborate threshold drawings. 7. In fact, each of the four cardinal points, as well as the intermediate points of the compass, in terms of direction, are allotted among others a n?ga guardian. From a sociological perspective, it is interesting to note that the selection of the site, the orientation of the building, its height, the size of its entrance doors, and so forth depended on the owner's caste.</page><page sequence="5">KiIambi: Toward an understanding of the muggu 75 Preparation of the infrastructure for a muggu. Hyderabad, 1981. the duty of the women, and the principal ingredients required are cow-dung and darbha grass. They dilute the cow-dung with water and make a sort of plaster with it, which they spread over the floor with their hands, making zigzags and other patterns with lime or chalk as they go on. They then draw wide lines of alternate red or white over this and sprinkle the whole with darbha grass, after which the place is perfectly pure. This is the way in which Hindus purify their houses day by day from the defilements caused by promiscuous goers and comers. It is the rule amongst the upper classes to have their houses rubbed over once a day with cow-dung, but in any class it would be considered an unpardonable and gross breach of good manners to omit this ceremony when they expected friends to call or were going to receive company. This custom appears odd at first sight, but it brings this inestimable benefit in its train, that it cleanses the house where it is in use from all the insects and vermin which would otherwise infest them. (Dubois 1906: 153-154) If the threshold, then, literally denotes the entrance to a house ? the line one crosses on entering ? at a figurative level, it also evokes another kind of entry, a passing over from one state to another, the end of something that implies the beginning of something else. It is in this sense that I spoke of the threshold as a point of demarcation between exterior and interior. The threshold as a concept, however, presents other nuances and reverberations. One could say, for instance, that the threshold is precisely that point that overcomes the dichotomy between exterior and interior, a point that is neither exterior nor interior, in relation to which one must again situate oneself as being either outside or inside. The threshold, then, is a "point zero" ? a point that one is obliged to cross to enter or leave the house, yet it is neither exterior nor interior. Being neither one nor the other, it is reminiscent of the essence referred to in Hindu metaphysics as brahman, which, by its pervasive, all-encompassing, and limit- or category-defying nature, can be described solely in negative terms. There can be no pointing to the interstitial, except through gestures and mediations such as cult objects and buildings, or, as in what occupies us here, the threshold drawings. In this perspective, one could also talk about the temple, which interiorizes the cosmos (or should one say terrestrializes the virtuality inherent in the universe?) ? the delimited space, which reverberates in evocation and invocation of the divine, as the boundary that encloses a particularization of the infinite and the transcendent. In terms of sacred geometry, it is a kind of perpendicular vanishing line, or open-ended pyramid with its apex downward, which, in pure fictive space, permits the permeation and the incorporation of the infinite and of the finite. Is it these spatio-metaphysical lines that render the threshold, as a location, particularly potent? Is that why the muggu is drawn only on the threshold ? a magical drawing on a magical space? If so, the comparison between muggu and temple becomes relevant, and the former can be seen as a domestic temple that is reerected each day, yet is different from the domestic altar. The threshold, by its very nature, parallels the potency of the space before the altar or temple and becomes (as far as domestic space is concerned) a consecrated area whereby the divine can penetrate.8 The everyday muggu ? the Sankr?nti muggu How should one contrast or compare the everyday muggu and the ceremonial one that is associated with the festival of Sankr?nti? Perhaps the distinction should not be emphasized: the gesture of drawing the domestic muggu follows certain rules and is not less ceremonial because it is executed every day. Neither is the tracing of the white-chalk or rice-powder muggu less of a ritual than that of the more elaborate and colored one drawn 8. An episode in the R?m?yana talks of Lak?mana (Rama's brother) drawing a magical line outside the hut in which he lived with Rama and S?t? in exile. The line was protective (potent) as long as S?t? remained within its confines, and it was only when she crossed that line that R?vana, the demon king, was able to kidnap her. There is a superstition that it is inauspicious to leave the house if a person's head or feet accidentally strike the threshold (Thurston 1912: 22).</page><page sequence="6">76 RES 10 AUTUMN 85 Sankr?nti festival muggu. Hyderabad, 1981. on Sankr?nti. A description of the festival will perhaps clarify the question of the relation of these two types of ritual drawings. Sankr?nti, also known as Pongal in Tamil Nadu, is a harvest festival occurring between January 12 and 14, considered to be the only specifically solar festival in South India. It marks the winter solstice, when the sun, having reached the southernmost point in the zodiac, enters Capricorn (makara) and begins its northward journey (uttar?yana). The entry of the sun into each zodiacal sign is called a sankr?nti (incoming), which corresponds to the first day of the solar month. Sankr?nti thus means entry, an incoming, the passing from one zodiacal sign into another, just as the threshold is the limit and the passage between one kind of space and another. The Sankr?nti muggu, then, drawn on a space that implies, ambiguously, entering and leaving, commemorates another entry, namely, that of the sun, into a new zodiacal sign. The makara sankr?nti is considered especially auspicious. Linked to the uttar?yana, when the sun's Muggu with elaborate serpentine motif and colored lotus image in its center. Hyderabad, 1981. warmth and the length of days are increasing, it represents the "day" of the gods. The uttar?yana is contrasted to the daksin?yana (southward progress of the sun from the summer to the winter solstice), which is considered inauspicious, representing the "night" of the gods and the time when the spirits of the dead are awake. The legend goes that Bhlsma, the patriarch of the Mahabharata, was mortally wounded during the inauspicious daksin?yana, but deliberately willed to live until the sun had turned northward so that he could die at an auspicious moment. It is auspicious to die once the sun has turned northward; in fact, the month preceding the festival of the winter solstice is considered to be made up entirely of unlucky days, particularly inauspicious even for dying. The very fact that the sun is considered to be reborn on Sankr?nti makes it a good moment to die. Death and life are the two sides of the same coin; the sun being reborn enables the individual to die "properly," as death itself (for those who have not exhausted their karmic residue) is considered to be the threshold of a new life. Death, again like the threshold, is at once a point of entry and departure. It is interesting to note some of the nuances of this life-death complex. Not only are the days preceding Sankr?nti unlucky, but they are also haunted by the spirits of the dead. When these cease to be active (temporarily, in the uttar?yana), it is considered auspicious to die oneself. Sankr?nti is also called peddapa?duga, a term with a double connotation: pecfda means big, grand, so one can translate it as "grand festival" (pa?duga meaning festival), but it also means elders, or superiors. Hence Sankr?nti is also pedda(leku) pa?duga, festival for the ancestors, or even just for those situated higher on the hierarchy than oneself (see Herrenschmidt 1982). The ambiguity is even more striking when one recalls that the muggu are never drawn in front of a house where a recent death has taken place; yet it is at the moment when the sun has been "reborn" and it is most auspicious for oneself to die that the most elaborate muggu are drawn.9 The festival normally lasts three or four days. The first day is called Bhogi Pongal (Pongal of Joy) in Tamil Nadu, or just Bhogi in Andhra Pradesh. Dubois refers to Bhogi as the day when relatives and friends exchange visits and presents. The second day is called Makara Sankr?nti, or S?rya Pongal in Tamil Nadu. Dubois (whom Layard has principally relied upon) mentions that 9. Layard mentions that typical muggu designs can be found on mortuary pottery.</page><page sequence="7">Kilambi: Toward an understanding of the muggu 77 Threshold drawings from South India, svastika motif: Kolam "lotus flower" (center), kolam "Pavitram" (left and right). After Layard 1937. the threshold drawings are drawn only during the calamitous month that precedes Sankr?nti, and he does not refer to their preeminence in the festival itself. During the inauspicious month which preceded the Pongal, sannyasis or mendicants go from door to door about four o'clock in the morning, waking all sleepers by beating their gongs, warning them to be on guard and to take every precaution against the evil influences of this unlucky period, by appeasing, by means of prayers and sacrifices, the god Siva, who presides over it. With this purpose in view, the women of the house every morning prepare a small patch about a yard square outside the door, smearing it with cowdung, and tracing several white lines upon it with rice flour. They then place within this square several pellets of cowdung, each adorned with a pumpkin flower. I believe these pellets are supposed to represent Vighneswara, the god of obstacles (Gane?a), whom they seek to appease by giving him a bouquet.... Every evening these little balls of cowdung, together with their flowers, are carefully collected, to be kept till the last day of the month. When this day arrives the women, who alone are charged with this ceremony, put them into a new basket, and accompanied by musical instruments and clapping of hands, they solemnly carry them away beyond the precincts of their dwellings and throw them into a tank or some other retired but clean spot. (Dubois 1906:571) Layard seems to have interpreted the threshold drawings as being exclusively representative of the unlucky month that precedes Sankr?nti. That he should link them with death is valid only in part; the aspect of regeneration should also be stressed. This latter point is corroborated by the presence of extremely elaborate muggu on the day that the sun is reborn. It is probable that the festival has undergone changes since Dubois wrote his description and that customs respected two hundred years ago are not followed today. My own knowledge is restricted to Hyderabad ? an urban context. I have never seen pellets of cowdung being collected throughout the month to be thrown away at the end of it. Nor do mendicants beat gongs and wake up inmates during the period that precedes the festival. An Indian artist who grew up in a small village in Tamil Nadu, however, hasjtold me that the muggu drawn during the monsoon and as the rains approach become extremely complicated and are different from those that accompany the festival of Sankr?nti. His interpretation was that, along with beneficial effects, the monsoons were also the harbingers of disease and sickness, which could strike both animals and humans. It is to combat the "destructiveness" of natural elements that the drawings become so elaborate, their complexity increasing their potency, as it were, conferring to them more protective power. Thus the muggu drawn before the festival (as is evident from the passage cited from Dubois) and the monsoon muggu both avert calamities, but of different sorts. The fact remains that the muggu are drawn every ** "* 4 V - .:. * -\*?%**v- .&gt;. V -V Muggu reminiscent of svastika motif.

The ceremony of the cowdung pellets and flowers is restricted to the day of Sankr?nti itself, and is not performed, as Dubois says, during the whole of the preceding month ? at least today. The third day of the festival is called by Dubois "Pongal of the Cows," and it is in fact dedicated to that sacred animal. The cows and oxen are given a free day, their horns are decorated, and they are allowed to wander at their leisure (Dubois 1906: 573). A more contemporary version of Sankr?nti as it is celebrated in South Indian villages comes from Srinivas. Although it differs in certain details (such as the use of cowdung pellets or the procession of mendicants who wake people up), it also corroborates Dubois's description. The connection with the agricultural cycle and the bovine animals is apparently still very much respected, and the festival occurs at the end of the rice harvest. A three-day festival when the newly harvested rice was rituallyim cooked and eaten. Ritual expressing a wish for abundance of the rice crop and increase of the herd was also part of Sankr?nti. Another element of the festival was the expression of thanks to the cattle. Bullocks and cows (but not buffaloes) were washed clean, and their horns painted a variety of colours. Gold and silver paper were stuck on the horns, and turmeric paste (a symbol of auspiciousness) was rubbed on the animal's body. Some of the new rice which had been cooked was offered to cattle as also was sugar cane, banana and jaggery. In the evening the animals were taken in procession with band and pipe, the beating of tam-tams, and light. Small piles of straw were placed in a line and set on fire, and the animals were made to jump over the flames. They were then brought home in procession after being given sweet and savory rice (huggi). (Srinivas 1976: 128) Gulati also stresses the solar character of the festival and sees therein "the desire to gain their [supernatural agents'] favour or propitiate them to call forth their sympathy, to appease or inflame their wrath ..." (Gulati 1968). But the connection between the muggu and the festival is most explicit in Sankr?nti itself. The houses are thoroughly cleaned (and repaired if need be) during the days preceding the festival. The ceremony begins very early, and the threshold is purified before sunrise; as I 10. My emphasis. The ritual aspect has to do with the cooking of rice in new pots placed in the center of the muggu and is discussed later. t '_ - - -.j??* ??r -, *V tu&gt;v- ?r^^HUv1 '/.r&gt;/&gt;^^^H -^ -? \i ir^ \^ ' V $' r .^^HSgy.v ',##4?^^^^H Muggu "Chariot of the Sun," Sankr?nti festival. Hyderabad, 1981. have noted, the muggu are very carefully done, with greater attention to aesthetic considerations. There is, in fact, an unstated competition among the women of the same locality, each vying with the other to produce the best muggu. On this day it is often the mistress of the house herself who undertakes the task of drawing the muggu. Clad in new sari and freshly bathed, she purifies the threshold and then traces the muggu ? with colored powder, rather than white. The colors are vivid and the designs intricate. The muggu executed, the woman puts a ball of cowdung in the center of the drawing, with yellow pumpkins scattered on it. A fire is lit (the cowdung serving as fuel) and the newly harvested rice is, theoretically, cooked along with milk, jaggery, and spices in a new mud pot placed at the center of the drawing. Actually, the sweet rice (shakkarpongal) is cooked in the kitchen, but a symbolic fire is still lit in the center of the muggu. The word pongal comes from pongaradu in Tamil, or pongindi in Telugu, both of which signify to boil. When Hindus exchange visits on this day, their first words are "Has the rice boiled?" To this, the answer is "It has boiled." The sweet pongal is then offered to the gods (and ancestors) and then distributed to visitors and members of the family as consecrated pras?dam. It is the character of the festival of Sankr?nti, then, and the importance given to its proper celebration, that lend the muggu a specially ritual quality. This is to say that the temporal dimension of the muggu shifts from the daily to the annual ? from a gestural reiteration of the moment that is neither day nor night (the muggu are supposed to be drawn at dawn) to when the sun</page><page sequence="9">Kilambi: Toward an understanding of the muggu 79 changes its zodiacal direction. In the light of Kuiper's remarks regarding the mythological battle between Indra and Vrtra, Sankr?nti assumes yet another dimension. The battle itself occurs at the beginning of creation, "when there was not yet a heaven and the gods consequently did not yet have the amrta/soma at their disposal, as it was still guarded together with all the goods of life (such as water, rasa, the essence of life; and sun, the light of life and the worlds) in the primordial hill by the serpent. The fact that Indra wins them and makes the sun rise is this great creative act, which is repeated every morning and causes a new crisis every year at the winter solstice" (Kuiper 1945 ? cited in introduction to Kuiper 1983: 6-7).n It is perhaps this "crisis" and Indra's subsequent victory impelling the change of direction of the sun that find powerful echoes in the elaborate muggu drawn at Sankr?nti. On the other hand, Indra's creative act, "which is repeated every morning," is reiterated by the everyday muggu and seems to justify the assumption that the muggu may be a form of s?rya namask?r. Muggu ? ephemerality An important aspect of the everyday muggu is brought out by the fact that no attempt is made to preserve them. Made to be walked upon, to be obliterated, they will be redone the next morning. It is precisely because of this ephemerality that the gesture of invoking and propitiating the powers, deified or not, becomes possible. Just as the sun rises each morning and sets each evening, the muggu is redone every day. The "constant" that is evident in the reiteration of the ritual ? not only perpetuated through the centuries but also repeated each day*? is offset by the ephemerality of the drawing itself. In this sense, the time of day when they are drawn (when night and day are in an uncertain embrace) and the place where they are drawn (a point neither exterior nor interior) reveal a new dimension and meaningfulness. Repetition and ephemerality are another dialectical dimension of the complex symbolic connotations of the muggu. The muggu, then, are made to be trodden upon. The foot touches the muggu; but the foot is also the point of man's contact with Mother Earth, source of nourishment of the physical body. The network of invisible arteries presumed to exist in the foot is believed to draw up energy from the earth like the roots of a tree, and a person can replenish his strength by standing with bare feet on the naked soil, thus absorbing vitality from the primordial source of all terrestrial life. Apparently more than poverty is involved in the predilection shown by most Indians for walking barefoot. But returning to our argument, the importance of the foot and its capacity to absorb terrestrial energy explains why the muggu must be trodden upon. How much more energy can be interiorized when the foot is placed in contact not just with the earth, but with consecrated earth ? the place where the muggu is drawn. In this context, it should also be mentioned that custom dictates that the first person to walk upon the muggu must be the husband. This of course relates to brahmanical patriarchal notions, but also perhaps to the pre-Aryan role of the woman as nourisher and sustenance of the household. Among the duties spelled out by Vasista in the Padmapur?na is the following: "She must be careful to sweep her house every day, to smooth the floor with a layer of cow-dung, and to decorate it with white tracery"; and among the laments a woman makes on being widowed, there is the cry of having fulfilled her wifely duties, including having swept the floor and decorated it, so why has he (the husband) thus left her (Dubois 1906: 346). The obliteration of the muggu by the tread of human feet is a second aspect of ephemerality; the first is inherent in the material used for the drawing ? rice powder. It may be important, then, to note that ephemeral powder drawings are also used in other special circumstances in India, such as the Pulluvan healing-exorcism rituals. The Pulluvan of Malabar are "astrologers, medicine-men, priests and singers in snake groves" (Thurston and Rangachari 1904-1909). They use complicated serpentine drawings on the ground ? not unlike the typical muggu ? to exorcise spirits. The following passage highlights both the universality of the snake symbol in India and the functional ephemerality of the drawing through intentional, marked obliteration. A Pulluvan and his wife preside at the ceremony called Pamban Tu Hal to propitiate the snake gods of the nagattan kavus, or serpent shrines. For this, a pandal (booth) is erected by driving four posts into the ground, and putting over them a silk or cotton canopy. A hideous figure of a huge snake is made on the floor with powders of five 11. There are other implications, however. Water, or more specifically the primordial waters, and the serpent are considered to be the embodiment of the Feminine Essence. Indra's victory would be interpreted by Maury (1969) as the victory of the Aryan-Vedic patriarchal notions on the pre-Vedic preeminence and importance accorded to the Divine Female.</page><page sequence="10">80 RES 10 AUTUMN 85 colours. Five colours are essential, as they are visible on the necks of snakes. Rice is scattered over the floor. Worship is offered to Ganesa, and cocoanuts and rice are offered. Incense is burnt, and a lamp placed on a plate. The members of the family go round the booth, and the woman, from whom the devil has to be cast out, bathes, and takes her seat on the western side[12] holding a bunch of palm flowers. The Pulluvan and his wife begin the music, vocal and instrumental, the woman keeping time with the pot drum by striking on a metal vessel. As they sing songs in honour of the snake deity, the young female members of the family, who have been purified by a bath, and are seated, begin to quiver, sway their heads to and fro in time with the music, and the tresses of their hair are let,loose. In their state of excitement, they beat upon the floor, and rub out the figure of the snake with palm flowers. This done, they proceed to the snake grove, and prostrate themselves before the stone images of snakes and recover consciousness. They take milk, water from a tender cocoanut, and plantains. The Pulluvan stops singing, and the ceremony is over. . . . Sometimes, it is said, it may be considered necessary to rub away the figure as many as 101 times, in which case the ceremony is prolonged over several weeks. Each time that the snake design is destroyed, one or two men, with torches in their hands, perform a dance, keeping step to the Pulluvan's music. (Thurston and Rangachari 1904-1909: 232-233) The "aim" of this rite, insofar as aims of magical rites can be stated concretely, obviously differs from the general use of the muggu as threshold drawings and their "nonintentional," or nonmarked, obliteration. But if we follow (among other scholars) Kosambi's line of thought we find, in elaborately sanskritized ceremonies, traces of ancient pre-Hindu conceptions that are particularly explicit in the villages and among the "lower" castes. The comparison between threshold drawings and similar drawings used in other circumstances then becomes relevant, as we shall see in the case of the comparison of the muggu and the mandalalyantra diagrams. Muggu ? structure The following discussion of the technical aspects of the threshold designs is based on the analysis developed by Layard from a comparison with analogous sand drawings of Malekula (New Hebrides). After having 12. An ambiguous cardinal direction. The west is considered to be inauspicious, and the fact that an evil spirit has to be exorcised (in the Pulluvan ritual) makes it perhaps necessary that the woman in question sit facing the inauspicious direction as long as she herself contains negative power. discussed it at length with reference to Malekulan sand tracings, Layard recognized traces of the motive of the labyrinth in the South Indian drawings as well. He added, however, that in Malekula the culture is still sufficiently archaic for the connection of the designs with actual labyrinths to be, with the aid of mythological data, clearly traced. In South India, the prototype ... is already so degraded that, without the Malekulan evidence, the labyrinthine origin of the designs would not be traceable at all.13 (Layare/ 1937) Before I give a partial account of Layard's analysis of the threshold designs, however, it would be useful to specify the implications of the term "labyrinth." Among the various definitions of the word furnished by Santarcangeli in the Oxford Dictionary, the following is fairly representative: "A complicated and irregular route, with multiple passages, through and around which it is difficult to find one's way without a guide" (Oxford Dictionary, French edition, 1967, my translation). This, as well as the other definitions he cites, is not entirely satisfactory. As he himself says, there are all kinds of labyrinths, and they are not necessarily a system of or a "network of passages." Besides, a labyrinth need not presuppose an edifice; it can be drawn on the ground, on paper, and so forth, as is the case with the Malekulan sand tracings and the threshold drawings in South India, if indeed the labyrinthine character of the latter is accepted. Santarcangeli (to whom I shall refer extensively to complement Layard's description) finally abandons the idea of an all-inclusive definition and settles for the generic: "Tortuous course, where it is sometimes easy, without a guide, to get lost." That he should emphasize "sometimes" is interesting. It leaves room for speculation; because if it is also possible not to lose one's way, then the "guiding thread" that can serve as guide can be metaphysical (and depend on the individual's belief) as well as representational. I refer here to the use of m?ndalas (about which more will have to be said). In these too one can find a labyrinthine motive; yet a mystic, adept at meditating on and following the movements inherent in the m?ndala in a multidimensional way, does not in fact "lose his way," but uses the dynamic quality of meandering linearity to attain sublimity. Thus, we can again agree with Santarcangeli that "there are no limits as to the forms of the labyrinth; so the aspect that this can take in any given time and any specific social context, will always 13. Compare the more recent photos of the muggu with those reproduced from Layard.</page><page sequence="11">Kilambi: Toward an understanding of the muggu 81 Structure of South Indian threshold ground drawing. After Layard 1937. be the signature of a style, of a conception of life, of a way of being" (Santarcangeli 1974: 47). Whether the South Indian threshold designs can be brought under the category of "labyrinthine," or whether one can presuppose an originally labyrinthine character now "degraded," is the question that Layard approached fruitfully by comparing them with the sand tracings found in Malekula, in the Melanesian archipelago of the New Hebrides. The aim of such a comparison could not of course be either to prove with certainty the labyrinthine character of the muggu or to establish a definite cultural-historical connection between the Pacific and the Indian subcontinent. Instead it is an attempt to analyze an aspect of the threshold drawings by formal comparison with "similar" drawings from another region that are singularly well documented. In reference to labyrinth ritual in Malekula, Layard distinguishes two classes of designs: a) A single, continuous line, having a definite beginning and end, crossing and recrossing itself on a previously Structure of ground drawing from Malekula, New Hebrides (Vanuatu). After Layard 1937. drawn framework made of straight lines set at right angles to one another. The framework represents the structure of the labyrinth, and the continuous line, the path traced by the initiate through it. b) A single never-ending line enclosing a space, based on a framework of small circles or dots. The dots represent the eyes, nostrils and breasts of the Guardian Ghost and the never-ending line, the outline of her body.14 (Layard 1937: 122) The Malekulan design here reproduced does share a few characteristics with the muggu form, although the latter lends itself to a different classification: one could talk of floral, floro-geometrical, and geometrical motifs with reference to the muggu (excluding the purely 14. Layard adds that the resemblance (which does exist if one compares the pictures provided) between the Malekulan and South Indian designs could be explained by a megalithic migration from the Near East via the Indian Ocean, which would have transmitted parts of an original culture complex. Obviously, there is no way of substantiating such an hypothesis, either as to the direction in which the migration would have taken place, or as to the originality of the culture complex in question.</page><page sequence="12">82 RES 10 AUTUMN 85 figurative designs), but then most of the drawings that fit into these rubrics have both linear as well as rounded configurations. All the drawings in South India are based on an infrastructure of dots, which are then linked together either in a linear manner or are circumvented, or both. Moreover, the South Indian drawings are not necessarily restricted to a single never-ending line, but as Layard himself noted, they often have double or triple continuous lines, or even two or three main lines that cross each other. I shall restrict myself here not only to those kinds of Malekulan drawings that reveal the most similarity with the South Indian drawings furnished by Layard, but also to those that resemble contemporary threshold drawings. Layard singles out the "diagonal framework" as characteristic of South Indian threshold drawings ? a single never-ending line crossing itself diagonally, on which other lines can be superimposed. He also distinguishes the single never-ending line from a continuous line. This basic structural framework, reminiscent of Malekulan sand tracings, leads Layard to speculate on the possible labyrinthine origin of the threshold drawings in South India. He correlates their structure with other aspects, such as the obligatory walking on the muggu, and with the fact that they are drawn during an inauspicious month following which the sun is "reborn."15 These aspects remind Layard of the maze dances in Malekula where the designs are supposed to be drawn by the Female Guardian Ghost. The interpretation of the sand-tracings and dance motives as being in fact maze-designs was based on the evidence of a large number of continuous-line figures, only two of which bore any resemblance whatever to the modern conception of a labyrinth. Nevertheless, the associated mythology, interpreted as being the distant echo of once factual performances, led to the conclusion that the entire series was in fact derived from two prototypes representing a) the path traced by the initiate through the labyrinth and b) the figure of the Guardian Ghost herself. . . . The original character of the labyrinth was far from being of stereotyped form, such as we now know it, but consisted of turning and twisting ways which actually depended for their efficacy on the fact that they were always different, and that the way through could therefore never be learned except by those who held the key. (Layard 1937: 169) 15. Perhaps Layard was unaware that the threshold drawings are executed each morning. It would appear more plausible to interpret the muggu in light of Kuiper's remarks concerning the crisis at the winter solstice (the inauspicious month) and Indra's creative act in making the sun rise each morning. This refers primarily to Malekula, because Layard admits that almost all the drawings in South India have lost their labyrinthine character ? if they ever possessed one. It is true, however, that a number of the snake drawings consist of criss-crossing spirals that make up a never-ending line. While "the passage from a spiral to a truly labyrinthine design is undeniable," the spiral is not a labyrinth. Santarcangeli writes: That the spiral is associated with the symbol of water, life, fertility, the womb, is well known. But it is also very probable that above all the uninterrupted line represents .. . immortality, the long development of the soul, "the thread one does not cut"; the consciousness, whether clear or not, of the continuity of a "life-death-life" drive. (Santarcangeli 1974: 146) One can talk of the muggu as representing the end product of this continuity and dynamism, but at a different level than would result from its presumed association with the labyrinth. One of the facts that perhaps induced Layard to consider the threshold drawings as degraded descendants of the labyrinth is the actual existence of stone labyrinths near the ruins of the city of Kundani at Hosur Taluq in Salem district, which closely resemble the Cretan labyrinth. J. W. Breeks also had noted that perfectly Knossian labyrinthine designs were drawn on the walls of houses by the Kotas of the Nilgiris (An Account of the Primitive Tribes of the Nilgiris, London, 1873, pp. 41, 124 ? quoted by Santarcangeli, 1974: 199). The other two points that led Layard to deduce a labyrinthine motive, if not motif, are the drawings called pavitram, and the recurrence, in numerous threshold drawings, of the snake symbol (which will be discussed later). Layard notes that while none of the drawings properly resembles a ring, a number of them are termed so. Hence, he sees not a factual but a symbolic connection between the pavitram and the design said to represent it. The sanskrit root for this word (pavitram) is PU, of which the two allied meanings are: a) to cleanse, a meaning doubtless pregnant with spiritual intent, referable in this case presumably to the month of sickness during which the designs are made.1161 16. The word pavitram is indeed interesting. Its cleansing aspect can be considered otherwise, that is, with direct reference to the gesture of purifying the threshold and its protective effect. The second aspect as well fits into what has been said already of the "magical" quality of the muggu, of delineating and "charging" a restricted space before the house with the potency of elementary powers, divinised or otherwise. More will be said on this point later.</page><page sequence="13">Kilambi: Toward an understanding of the muggu 83 ?3-? Structure of the kolam of the type called "Brahma's knot," South India.

(Layard 1937: 137) Another description of the pavitram comes from Abb? Dubois: The object of the pavitram is to scare away giants, evil spirits, or devils, whose mission it is to bring disasters on men and mar the ceremonies of the Brahmins. The very sight of the pavitram makes them tremble and take to flight. This powerful amulet consists of three, five or seven stalks of darbha grass plaited together in the form of a ring . . . the 17.

(Dubois 1906: 152-153) Other meanings of the word include that of "a ring of kusa (darbha) grass worn on the fourth finger on certain religious occasions" and "the sacred thread worn by men of the first three castes of the Hindus . .. this grass (Eragrostis cynosuroides)18 of course is sacred, and there 18.

After Layard 1937. is a virtue also in the knot in which it is tied" (Layard 1937: 138). From the knot inherent in the pavitram, Layard comes to Brahma mudi or Brahma's knot, "the knot with which the ends of the three strands of the sacred cord of a Brahmin are tied together in such a way that no loose end is visible and the cord becomes virtually a never ending line. . . ."19 The principle uniting both these objects (pavitram and Brahma mudi) with the designs is that of the continuous looped line, represented in the case of the pavitram by the knotted grass ring, and in that of the Brahma mudi by the knotted cord . . . similar to "Ariadne's clue", the thread which enabled the prisoner to escape from the labyrinth, in 19. Another plausible interpretation, not only of the knot but the thread itself, whether worn as a ring or on the wrist or in the manner of the three upper castes, is its efficacy in creating a magical barrier. When used as a ring, it works as a magical circle keeping off evil influences and preventing the dissipation of good forces. It is also a symbol of "binding" one to another, as in the case of the r?khee bandhan tradition, when bracelets of coloured thread are tied on the wrists of brothers by women, thus binding them to protect and guard them during the year. Kolam named "marriage platform," South India. After Layard 1937. the knotted grass or cord, associated as it is with the basic elements of the South Indian threshold designs, we may most probably be in the presence of the same symbol of escape from the physical as well as from the spiritual labyrinth. (Layard 1937: 139-140) It is the continuous-line motive in the snake image that is irresistibly evocative, apart from the sacro mythological connotations of the beast. More specifically, Layard says: Figure 18 for instance, called "Border of a single cobra", consists of a single doubled never-ending line including in itself the square linear framework on which the Malekulan designs belonging to Class A are based. . .. What has clearly happened is that, at some period in the development of these designs, the makers of them, concentrated as they were on the phenomenon of the continuous line meandering in and out of itself, were struck by the similarity of motive exhibited by the long curling body of the snake. The sacredness of the snake doubtless contributed to the identification and all the artist did, was to construct one of the standard never-ending double-line</page><page sequence="15">Kilambi: Toward an understanding of the muggu 85 designs and to interrupt it at one point, making of one of the loose ends the head and of the other end the tail of the revered reptile.20 (Layard 1937: 153-156) Layard also compares these threshold designs with tattoo designs practised by the Koravas, a nomadic tribe of South India (see also Thurston and Rangachari 1904-1909, vol.3). To conclude this excursus on the Dravidian Malekulan connection, we can once again refer to Santarcangeli's brief text. In it, on the one hand he highlights the improbability of actual labyrinthine origins for either the tattoo or threshold drawings, but on the other he admits to a labyrinthine character (which is not the same thing) in plastico-visual representations such as the muggu (Santarcangeli 1974: 197-198). Muggu ? the gesture Up to this point, I have discussed the muggu in terms of (a) the time when it is drawn, (b) the implications of the threshold as the space designated for the muggu, (c) the differences and similarities between the everyday and Sankr?nti muggu, and (d) Layard's interpretation of the threshold designs as having been originally labyrinthine in character. Clearly, the threshold drawings are not merely ornamental; the gesture of delineating and consecrating a space has to be understood as an expression of a sense of sympathetic relation between the human and the nonhuman spheres of man's experience. The articulation of such a sympathy, however, whether in the form of magical diagrams on the ground or the investing of supernatural powers in an object, or indeed through other acts, must not be conceived as an attempt to control cosmic forces that are in fact perceived as infinitely powerful. Indeed, if the aim of such gestures, magical or religious, had been really to "control" ? in the sense of subjugating elemental forces ? they would have long been abandoned. Such gestures continue precisely because they express a realization and reaffirmation of the sense of unity that links the human being to everything that surrounds him, natural and supernatural, from which he has issued and to which he will return. As stated by 20. Santarcangeli comments: "The serpent has convolutions in common with those of the labyrinth: it is the ambivalent bearer of death and of regeneration, guardian of the Tree of Life: it appears thus to have an apotropaic function in the most diverse contexts." Wittgenstein, adherence to a religious symbol is not based on opinion, and error arises only in connection with opinions (Wittgenstein 1982: 15). The "control" or temporary capture of the infinite and the divine in a finite space, I believe, is what characterizes the essence of the muggu. A presence is invoked within the confines of the magical diagram; its power is presumed to charge the area and thus permeate the person who has made the diagram. As Kramrisch says: Originally far removed from decoration, all these ritual magic designs are forms of a will directed to an end which is to confine and control a supernatural power and to isolate it from the ground. The effect of the symbolic shapes is at one with their efficacy. They do not form abstract patterns for they are the shape of conceptions. They are intuitive and functional diagrams transmitted by women. (Kramrisch 1968) Before turning to the content of the symbols involved ? and to the metaphysical conceptions and associated mythology that underlie those symbols ? it may be useful to dwell a little more on the act of inscription of the muggu. One can recognize in it a "confinement" of power in terms of space, wherein fiction is transcended by evocation (fiction, in the sense in which geometry is fiction, because of the sheer impossibility of "carving out" space, whether unidirectionally or multidirectionally). The cardinal points (the vertical and horizontal lines that one draws to infinity, as one turns one's head in all directions) have of course a great significance in Hindu thought.21 The merging of body, space, and cosmos is reflected in the muggu as well and will be more apparent in the passages that follow. I have drawn heavily on Brenda Beck's perceptive description of this merger (Beck 1976). She notes two important Hindu concepts that bear direct relevance to the theme in question: 1) ... the body must be continually realigned in space in order to make the most beneficial use of shifting lines of cosmic force. 2) ... in specialized Hindu rituals, the individual joins with and even becomes identical to the cosmos itself. (Beck 1976:214) 21. The spatial aspect is important in other areas too, that is, in the symbols themselves. The lotus and the intersecting triangles, traditionally associated with the m?ndala and yantra, and which are recurrent symbols in the muggu drawings as well, are also maps of the cosmos in terms of space. Vertical "lignes de fuite," which presuppose</page><page sequence="16">86 RES 10 AUTUMN 85 Each of the four cardinal points, and their corresponding midpoints, thus acquires a special meaning, which Beck has outlined with reference to Hindu Tamil Nadu. The east is the source of beneficial forces. It is the space of the rising sun and is thus considered extremely auspicious.22 The east (kir in Tamil) as a compass point, however, refers to space below. The west is considered maleficent (patu in Tamil, which means to set as well as to perish or die). But there is an ambiguity to this symbolic axis, because the west as a compass point has another name, mekk, which means height or superiority and thus contrasts with kir, mekk being space above. Similarly, the north is considered more auspicious than the south: "east-west serves as the axis of cosmic force, and north-south can be viewed as containing a secondary polarization of those forces that bear most directly on the human condition" (Beck 1976: 216). There are microcosmal correspondences to these directional "oppositions": the head is the most exalted part of the body as contrasted with the foot, the right is seen as being purer than the left, just as the front is more to be respected than the back.23 Beck also corroborates Kramrisch as to the magical and protective significance of the threshold drawings. She approaches their spatial aspects from a perspective different from Layard's, who concentrated more on the never-ending line motive in his attempt to reveal their labyrinthine character. Beck relates them directly to the Hindu conception of the significance of the cardinal points; according to her, the threshold drawings are based on a square infrastructure oriented to the cardinal points of space.24 She draws a parallel between the four cardinal points plus the central point and the directional implications of Siva's five faces. These five faces also are always laid out in a square space and oriented carefully in terms of the cardinal points. Each of Siva's heads is further represented by a separate sacred pot placed in its appropriate square. These are then worshipped in the order indicated. Each head is thought to face a particular direction of space, the primary head being described as oriented "upwards."1251 ... The main image, Siva's Ungarn, is located at the centre of the whole and its summit is associated with ?sana or the upward looking face. (Beck 1976:220-221) Parallel to the five faces, there are five mantras (Brahma mantra) that are addressed to each of Siva's faces. In that ritual, where the priest directly links the four cardinal points plus the centre with his own body, Beck sees "an identification of the basic body form with a ritual representation of the cosmos at large."26 horizontal links, represent not only man's entire eye-span insofar as he can apprehend space, but also man's attempt to touch the sky, that is, to embrace the infinite, which transcends all representation. That infinity, seen as a vanishing point, beyond all cardinal points, is represented by the centre, the b'mdu in the manclala. 22. Note that the woman who draws the muggu always faces the east while doing so, and the threshold, ideally if not in fact, opens to the east as well. Beck says that the shrines of gods and the position of individuals at ceremonies also share this orientation. 23. The ambiguity arises because of the relativity of the directions, that is, what is right, front, above from one point becomes the opposite when the position changes. Thus, oppositions are, in fact, always transcended in Hindu metaphysics. 24. The square can, however, be purely fictive. The corner points are always marked, but need not always be joined. From a more abstract point of view, one can say that a circle can contain a square or be inscribed within a square, just as it can contain intersecting triangles, whose apices, if joined, can once again result in a square. That is to say, there is a contiguity of all these geometrical figures, because one can be transformed into the other. The cardinal points can always be located, just as the centre can in all these figures. What is important is their interchangeability, that is, the square, triangle, and circle are not exclusive of each other, but each can contain or be contained within the other. 25. Upwards ? linked with the invisible perpendicular vanishing line that connects the cosmos with the earth. The upward direction emanates from the centre; it is represented by the vase placed in the centre of the m?ndala, or the new pot placed in the centre of the muggu and in which the new rice is cooked. (See Louise Allison Cort, "Temple Potters of Purl," Res 7/8, Spring/Autumn 1984, pp. 33-43.) The central point permits the entry of the divine, thus the sweet rice acquires a flavour that renders it pras?dam, in addition to the consecrated quality it obtains by being offered to the gods. The gods have already entered it before they "eat" it. 26. The significance of the number five has been interpreted at different levels. Maury links the five-headed aspect of Siva "to the symbolism of the female deity, the numeral equivalent of the Goddess in her manifestation as M?y?" (Maury 1969: 47). But Maury's main concern was to show the indigenous components in Hindu tradition and art and the supplanting of the functions and powers of the Goddess during the Vedic period, which saw the transfer of those powers to male gods. Kuiper approaches the symbolism of the number five from a different aspect, concentrating on the Vedic scriptures and seeing therein how dualities (upperworld-netherworld; male-female; serpent-bird; gods-demons) were transcended by synthesis. "It has long been observed that the predominant role of the number five in the Veda ... is due to the fact that the five points of the compass... represent in the Vedic scriptures the entire world. When five points are occasionally mentioned, that in the middle, where the speaker stands denotes the fifth." Citing Hestermann, he says that the adding of an extra element to a total "not only exceeds but also encompasses the preceding totality" (Kuiper 1983: 52-53).</page><page sequence="17">Kilambi: Toward an understanding of the muggu 87 Modern-style muggu in geometric form constructed around two perpendicular axes. Hyderabad, 1981. I mentioned earlier that the laying of the foundation stone was presumed to peg down the head of the cosmic serpent. That myth has a special version in Tamil Nadu, where the emphasis is on a being in the ground who has to be propitiated, but in accordance with the cardinal points. Folk tradition in the Coimbatore district holds that there is a being in or of the ground, called Vastu, who must be propitiated every time a building is constructed. ... His body is thought to exactly fill up a square space, and his head is said to be located in the north-east corner.... Vastu's fallen body is "held in place" by eight guardians1271 located at the eight compass points. These guardians, by their individual qualities and compass positions, embody forces that are linked to the daily cycle of the sun. Thus their role in pinning Vastu to earth can be seen as a further way of containing the motions of the sun within the borders of a square space. (Beck 1976:223-224) I referred to the ambiguity inherent in spatial oppositions, such as the one that contrasts the head to the foot. The latter extremity of the human body is traditionally the most impure, and yet the space consecrated by the muggu must be walked upon.28 Now Beck helps us to understand the significance of these ambiguous polarities by connecting the relationship Modern-style muggu. Hyderabad, 1981. between head and foot with the body-cosmos directional merger. South Indian astrological tradition again places the head in the north-east corner of the sacred space. The year, for astrologers, begins at this point, just as the sun can be understood to rise in the east after a brief dawn. It is also interesting that the feet in this cosmic scheme lie next to the head. At the beginning of the new year, then, a "great leap" must occur. If the movement during the year has been generally "downward" from head to feet, then there must be a sudden vertical rise in the north-east corner before the cycle can begin again. Such an upward thrust is fully appropriate to this particular position in space; in addition the hiatus between feet and head that is crossed at this point suggests a more general mystic theme in which two opposites are briefly and suddenly united. Finally, the progression of time "downwards" is quite in keeping with the well-known Hindu concept of larger yuga time cycles. The yugas, too, suggest a gradual falling off, a progressive degeneration of the cosmic condition. And at the end of both cycles, we find the idea of a rejuvenation or rebirth.29 (Beck 1976) In the beginning is the end; the infinity of the cosmos contained in a finite space, the threshold as "point zero." There would seem to be no doubt that almost 27. Compare with earlier reference to n?ga guardians of each of the cardinal points. Thus, although the cosmic serpent seems to be replaced by Vastu, the guardians remain. 28. The sign of respect shown to somebody considered superior to oneself (whether because of caste or age) is to touch the highest part of oneself (the head) to the lowest part of the other (the feet). 29. This mystical unification of contradictions has been described by Kuiper in another context, that of the cosmogonic/mythological relationship of Indra/Agni (Indra is said to have freed the sun from the primordial hill that floated on the primordial waters, the sun having been imprisoned along with amrta by VrtraAteruna; Agni manifests both the fire and the sun and rose upward after Indra's creative act) to Varuna, protector and ruler of those waters, who is simultaneously asura (signifies both the "older gods" and demonical forces) and deva</page><page sequence="18">88 RES 10 AUTUMN 85 every aspect of the muggu points to a mystical understanding of the interiorization of powers and elements that are all-encompassing, so infinitely beyond the self and yet existing within each individual: a temple within, a temple without, a place where the presence of the divine is invoked, a space that evokes the presence of the divine. The muggu is indeed a templum, reerected each day. The symbols Much more could be said on the metaphysics of space, but let us turn now to the symbols themselves, beginning with the names given to these drawings in Telugu and in Tamil. In Telugu, muggu means "a pattern or diagram drawn with lines of flour or coloured powder." Muggu as used in mugguluveyu signifies "to perform certain magic rites ... on a magic square drawn on the floor"30 (Telugu-English Dictionary). Although this definition of muggu lacks the richness of connotations attributed to the word kolam, it still corroborates the latter on an important point: the reference to magic rites on a magic square is significant, because the ubiquity of these drawings in Hyderabad, the seemingly matter-?f-fact way in which they are executed, and the authors' inarticulateness on their significance might tempt one to forget their "sacro magical" nature. For the moment, we can treat the reference to the magic square as a hint toward the origins of the muggu: were they perhaps considered at one time to be more potent? If so, a comparison between the m?ndala and the muggu (to which we shall return), where the latter could have "borrowed" from the former, becomes relevant. The word kolam means "line, current, watercourse, snake, ornament, figure, mask, display, bird, areca nut, loofah, and the planet Saturn" (Layard 1937: 175). All these various meanings ? some of which may seem mutually exclusive ? seem to imply motion, or force in movement. At the same time, the movement is inscribed within the muggu itself. One can conceive of this movement as multidimensional ? from the threshold, both into the house and into the person who has made the diagram (by the same token, if the gesture is seen as mapping the cosmos on a terrestrial canvas, the movement is from the divine toward the human). That the word kolam should signify line, watercourse, and current seems highly suggestive. Layard interprets these three connotations of kolam as being further indications of the continuous moving line motif. Similarly, m?ndala meditation involves following the lines of motion toward the square rim of the m?ndala, and then back toward the centre, the one direction pointing to the macrocosm and the other to the microcosm. Yet they are not exclusive: each implies the other. This is why the m?ndala has been interpreted as a map of the cosmos, permitting the meditator to interiorize both directions of movement and thus apprehend the unity of infinity and finiteness within himself. My concern here, however, is more with the immediate Hindu referents of these drawings, whether in custom, metaphysics, or mythology. The ornament/figure meanings of the word are fairly explicit, indications that the drawings are images that are meant to be decorative as well. As Coomaraswamy has pointed out, the ornamental or decorative character of works of art in general does not detract from their symbolic efficacy: Works of art are generally ornamental or in some way ornamental ... all the words that mean ornament or decoration ... probably in all languages, originally meant equipment. .. ornament is characterization, ornaments are attributes .. . since it is generally by means of what we now call its decoration that a thing is ritually transformed and made to function spiritually as well as physically. (Coomaraswamy 1956: 18) As we have seen, it is by the purification and tracing of the muggu that the threshold becomes a magical space evocative of the divine, and thus efficacious. Even the medieval Latin meaning of the word "decorative" "referred originally not to anything that could be added to an already finished and effective product merely to please the ear or eye, but to the completion [my emphasis] of anything with whatever might be necessary (god), asura turned deva, but is nonetheless the protector of the asuras. At the same time, Indra and Agni represent the upperworld (sky, sun) while Varuna is the guardian of the netherworld (the primordial waters). For a detailed discussion of these complicated nuances, see Kuiper (1983: 66-86). I cite here only what seems immediately relevant, that is, how the waters (below and feminine) and sky (above) are united, and how Varuna, said to reside in the subterranean palace that encloses the sun, is himself a "sun-seer." "Varupa's netherworld then extends over the earth as the night sky. The cosmic waters are at that time a celestial ocean (samudra). ... Varuna is both the god of the primeval waters under the earth (and in the western ocean), of the "stone house" in the netherworld, and of the night sky" (Kuiper 1983: 74-75). 30. This connotation justifies a closer examination of the m?ndala (inscribed in a square) and also of the sacred square drawn before a temple or house, and of the ritual described by Beck.</page><page sequence="19">Kilambi: Toward an understanding of the muggu 89 to its functioning, whether with respect to the mind or body" (Coomaraswamy 1956: 112). It is interesting that one meaning of kolam should refer to the planet Saturn, especially in view of the already considered implications of the time of day when the muggu is traced, of the symbolism of the sun and the sun god and of the possible transfer of function from S?vitr? to Savitr. Another name for the sun god is S?rya; his devotees go under the name of Saura ? an epithet also applied to the followers of the cult of Sani (Saturn), the son of S?rya and Chh?y? (Shade). Keeping in mind that the threshold drawings are normally executed at sunrise and become especially elaborate at the solar festival of Sankr?nti (which commemorates the rebirth of the sun), it is striking that one meaning of kolam should refer to Saturn ? the union of two opposites, light and shade! It brings to mind another of the polarities referred to earlier, that according to which the most auspicious time to die is precisely the moment when the sun is reborn. Layard, for his part, also interprets the bird as movement. It is not the bird itself that would be represented, but the "migrating" or "circling" motion reflected in the meandering lines of the threshold drawings. Stylized or otherwise, purely geometrical or with Kolam named "lotus flower dish," South India. After Layard 1937. floral overtones, most threshold drawings reveal three basic patterns with a densely charged symbolic content: the snake, the lotus, and the intersecting triangles. Not only do these symbols occur frequently in Hindu iconography, "folk" or classical, but they have also been the point of departure for metaphysical speculation. Moreover, each of them can be seen as embodiment of the Feminine Principle, Sakti, in its diverse manifestations. That they should consistently turn up in the muggu patterns cannot be mere coincidence. Apart from their being typically traditional Hindu/Indian motifs,31 there would seem to be a 31. Such motifs, for instance, can also be found in mehndi patterns. Mehndi is another decorative tradition practised and transmitted by women. The reddish-brown juice of the mehndi plant is used to decorate the palms and feet of women, especially at marriage ceremonies. The beautiful and intricate patterns resemble the traditional floor decorations, and the mehndi designs are supposed to symbolize and bring prosperity, goochfortune, and marital bliss. The patterns also change with the season; this seems to be the case with the threshold drawings in the villages, where they become more complicated as the monsoons approach, and extremely intricate during the rainy season, as if to increase their potency and power to ward off the evil spirits and malignance of the forces of nature. These motifs have also been richly exploited in Indian textiles and wall hangings, more so now because of the market that exists for such products in the West.

Also in this context, one must recall the m?ndala and yantra used in Hindu and Buddhist Tantrism. Tantrics who make a yantra have to avoid food prepared by women and even the sound of a woman's bangles. Kramrisch asks, "Is it partly because they have to guard their art from those who had the power to evolve it?" Thus, it appears that it will be useful if the discussion of each of these symbols will also touch on their ramifications in m?ndala symbolism. The serpent The generic name for the various snake deities and serpent people of Hindu mythology is naga, frequently represented as gigantic snakes of the cobra species with expanded hood and many lesser heads, or with human head and serpent body. The spectacle marks on the cobra's head are supposed to be a half swastika. The serpent is most notably associated with Siva, whose sacred thread is the serpent; his hair is knotted with one and he has serpents for bangles and anklets. That the serpent also is frequently linked with "dread" deities probably stems from the fact that it is intimately connected with the netherworld, which reflects just one of the many ambiguities inherent in the symbolism developed around the snake. Snake deities are custodians of the treasures of land and sea and are associated with hundreds of lakes,-springs, and wells throughout India. They also protect sacred precincts such as old abandoned temples (an avenue flanked by stone nagas traditionally forms the entrance to some temples). Anthills are their favourite haunts, and many anthills are believed to be the abode of naga treasure guardians.32 Serpents also are often regarded as representing one's deceased ancestors. The nagas inhabit the chthonian kingdom of P?t?la (or N?galoka), the serpent region. It is the most beautiful realm of all the worlds of heaven, earth, and hell. The sage Narada once paid a visit to P?t?la and declared that it was far more beautiful than Indra's heaven, offering every imaginable luxury and sensuous delight.33 Hence, it was also called K?maloka (kingdom of love). Ophiolatria or snake worship was common in India from pre-Aryan times and is still widespread throughout the subcontinent. Temples are dedicated to snakes, special festivals (for example, N?gapancami) are held in their honour, and, in several rites associated with their worship, milk and sometimes blood is poured over their images (see Mahalingam 1957; Walker 1968). Serpents also are attributed healing powers, especially against such virulent diseases as leprosy. Parts of the serpent's body are deemed to have remedial effects. In Indian myth and legend, there are numerous accounts of great heroes being restored to life or cured from wounds by fabulous snake people. The touch of the snake-king Vasuki's jewel brought the dead Arjuna back to life, and a naga drought saved the mortally wounded Bh?ma from the fangs of death and endowed him with immense strength (see Van Buitenen 1971). Mythologically, the n?gas are the progeny of K?dru, daughter of the arch rshi Daksa, and one of the thirteen who married the sage Kasyapa.34 The offspring of K?dru are also called K?draveya. K?dru herself is earth apotheosized and is one elemental specialization of the divine Nature. Among the thirteen wives of Kasyapa, one can compare K?dru with Vinat?, the former becoming the mother of the n?gas, and the latter, the progenitor of Garuda, the divine vulture, the vahana or vehicle of Visnu and the mortal enemy of the n?gas. This myth, according to Kuiper, "clearly represents the strife between the two cosmic moieties as the result of a contest between the two mythic primordial mothers" (Kuiper 1983: 32). Sesa (residue) is one of the best-known mythologized snake figures. Zimmer refers to Sesa as "a figure representing the residue that remained after the earth, the upper and infernal regions, and all their beings had 32. "The worship of the anthill at marriages and the custom of bringing the lucky earth from there are possibly connected with the fertility cult of snakes or of ants, for they multiply in great numbers" (Mahalingam 1957: 12). Another aspect of the anthill, its connection with the serpent and the netherworld, and by extension with the Feminine Essence, is brought out by Kuiper: "Further indirect confirmation can be found in the belief that the Asuras [my emphasis] secretly kept the moisture of the anthills, which implies a reference to the subterranean water" (Kuiper 1983: 97). The term naga is apparently a word of non-sanskritic origin. Maury points out that Sanskrit already has another word to designate the serpent ? sarpa, meaning the crawling and creeping one. Another proof of the non-sanskritic nature of the word is that it is the name of the obviously pre-Aryan N?ga tribe and of their land. 33. Was it meant as a reminder or provocation to Indra, who, it will be recalled, had vanquished the subterranean (primordial waters) Vrtra (a dragon ?zed version of the serpent) to create the duality of heaven and earth? 34. Kasyapa means tortoise and, according to Kuiper, is a typical representative of the totality. The tortoise was an incarnation of Visnu, who also represents totality.</page><page sequence="21">KiIambi: Toward an understanding of the muggu 91 Structure for kolam "four-headed cobra" (left) and "two-headed cobra" (right). After Layard 1937. been shaped out of the cosmic waters of the Abyss. The three created worlds are afloat upon the waters, i.e., they balance on the expanded hoods" (Zimmer 1974). Sesa's thousand heads are expanded into a mighty hood called Manidvipa; he forms the couch of the god Vi?nu, who reclines on his coils and is shaded by the multiple hood that spreads like a canopy over his head. Sesa often is depicted as holding a plough in one hand and a pestle in the other.35 At the end of each day of Brahma, all creation is destroyed by the fire that issues from the mouth of Sesa. Both Zimmer and Maury agree that the serpent is the physical equivalent of a metaphysical essence. The latter emphasizes the association of the serpent with the Feminine Essence and gives examples of the well-nigh universality of this association. He sees myths relating the victory of deified heroes over serpent-monsters as the "male usurpation and defamation of female power Four-serpent muggu. Hyderabad, 1981. 35. The attributes of plough and pestle refer to the idea of fertility. It has already been mentioned that a number of fertility rites are attached to the worship of the snake. Fertility should also be related to the earth, seen as a cosmic serpent. It is no wonder, then, that the entwined snake motif should figure so prominently in the Sankr?nti muggu, which is also a harvest festival when the gods are propitiated to ensure continuing soil fertility and abundance.</page><page sequence="22">92 RES 10 AUTUMN 85 and transcendence" (Maury 1969: 167). The dragon was perhaps the demonized aspect of the serpent.36 I have already referred to the violent enmity between the descendants of K?dru and Vinat?, that is, the serpent versus the eagle or vulture.37 Maury identifies Garuda according to Aryan-Vedic conceptions, as "symbol and representative of the high-god in male-oriented cultures and the irreconcilable foe of the serpent"; the serpent, then, is intimately linked with the cult of the Goddess and thus with pre-Aryan conceptions: "The serpent represents the foremost cultic and emblematic and animal equivalent of the Goddess. The life and death enmity of solar bird and serpent therefore reflects the antagonism of the opposing religious systems: pre-Aryan vs Vedic" (Maury 1969: 63). Maury's discussion of the solar bird is so explicit and significant in its implications that it merits being quoted in extenso, although his interpretation differs in certain respects from that provided by Kuiper. Again, when in his anthropomorphic aspect, he (Garuda) often appears independent of his divine lord (Visnu) as a divinity in his own right. In this role, moreover, he tends to manifest not only his disposition as the triumphant conquerer of the serpent, but also his ithyphallic nature, which is entirely uncharacteristic of, if not alien to the Vedic deity. Even his very appellation, Garuda, is not free of strange incongruity. Literally meaning "Water Swallower", it has been held to refer to his task, as personified solar power, of drying up the moisture of the ground. But in a tropical country, parched by heat and thirsting for the relieving and fructifying waters, this hardly constitutes a function as beneficial as would seem congruous with his identification with the divine "preserver" Visnu. The existence of these inconsistencies suggests that important native conceptions may have been synthesized with the Indo-Aryan tradition to modify the Hindu countenance of the solar bird. ... It is often supposed that this elemental antithesis of the drying heat of the sun and the all-penetrating moisture of the waters has been symbolized by the conflict of the solar bird and the serpent. (Maury 1969:82,87) Certainly important is the fact that, although the serpent is a recurring symbol in the threshold drawings, the bird never figures in them.38 One could approach the identification of the serpent with the Feminine Essence from another aspect of its complex symbolism. As noted by Jung, the snake is also significant as an instrument of regeneration. In Indian metaphysics, the quality of regeneration finds its expression in the concept of M?y? ? cosmic creation and dissolution, diverse manifestations of a finite reality ? and consequently in the popular emphasis on m?y? illusion. But M?y? should also be understood as M?y? Sakti, the serpent coiling about the "web of maya," the thread of the web issuing, as it were, from the snake's mouth, akin to the Goddess's serpentine energies. This is often reflected in muggu patterns ? sinuous entwined serpents that glide along within the structure of the 36. Krsna's victory over Kaliya, the serpent "king," or Heracles, who vanquished the two serpents sent by Hera in Greek mythology. I should perhaps qualify the earlier reference to Vrtra as being a dragonized version of the serpent. Kuiper refers to the powers of resistance (literal meaning of vrtra) encountered by Indra as being part of the primordial hill floating on the primordial waters. Elsewhere, he makes a reference to the serpent encircling the primordial hill, thus imprisoning the forces of light and life. He suggests that Indra's penetration of the mountain might be compared to the "forces of resistance" faced by the spermatozoon when it encounters the ovum. The situation after fertilization consists of a duality between the unformed embryo and the mother. In the Indian myth, the femininity of the primordial waters is explicitly attested, and although the "sex identity" of the primordial hill remains unclear, it is referred to as the offspring of those waters. However, consequent to Indra's penetration of the primordial hill, there is the duality between upperworld and underworld. The argument set out by Kuiper is extremely complicated and involves other mythological figures, different versions of the myths and attempts to correlate the interpretation of the Vedic myth of creation with psychological research on prenatal existence. To do justice to the various points developed by Kuiper would lead me away from the limits of this article. Yet there are two perspectives that I would like to repropose tentatively. On the one hand, one could deduce from the above description a male-female conflict, where the former principle vanquishes the latter, which is also the original principle. Does this then corroborate Maury's thesis of the supplanting of pre-Aryan feminine transcendence by Vedic patriarchal male-god-oriented conceptions? On the other hand (and in a less charged perspective) one could follow Kuiper's intuition and see in the act of "fertilization" (Indra's penetration) a cosmic renewal, from undifferentiatedness to the beginning of differentiated life in all the worlds ? an idea paralleled in other myths regarding the yuga cycles when complete dissolution is followed by a reconception and regeneration of life. Undoubtedly, this is an extremely sensitive problem that would deserve a much lengthier treatment. 37. The ambiguity here is that Visnu is depicted as reclining on a serpent, but it is Garu?la who is his vehicle. Maury considers Sesa and Va.suki as apologetic serpents, who after long austerities were restored to the divine fold. Kuiper, on the other hand, sees the attribution of the two mortal enemies (serpent and vulture) to Visnu as characteristic of the totality of Visnu, that is, he belongs to both parts, the upperworld (Garuda) and the netherworld (Sesa) (Kuiper 1983: 33). 38. This, despite the fact that one of the connotations of kolam was bird. The bird was not specified, and I deduce that it referred to the movement of the bird in "swoops and swirls" rather than to the bird itself, if Layard was not mistaken.</page><page sequence="23">Kilambi: Toward an understanding of the muggu 93 Muggu evocative of the endless-line motif in which the serpentine element is no longer in evidence. Hyderabad, 1981. muggu, ending where they start from while seemingly beginning where they end. This incessant motion, now revealing, now hidden, that is characteristic of M?y? Sakti or female dynamism, finds an extremely potent and adequate symbol in the serpent. It is the principle of infinite and continual transformation, which, in the realm of m?y?, assumes the aspect of eternal regeneration. It is this principle of which the serpent became the archetypal symbol, connoting the mystery of life itself and the magic of its formal mutations. (Maury 1969: 177) The fertility and procreation contingents of the serpent divinity's function, however, should not make us forget the erotic dimension of this very function, so evident in the entwined serpent pair motif in sculptural ?mages and muggu patterns. Iconographical evidence testifies to numerous female snake divinities and serpentine figures, not only in well-known temples but also in forgotten village shrines, as in Buddhist and Jaina art and in Mohenjo-Daro seals.39 The continuity of the serpentine motif that cuts across centuries and vast distances of space points to the extreme antiquity of the cult of the serpent. The erotic and generating features attributed to the reptile, thus made into an embodiment of the feminine energy principle, lends credibility to Maury's supposition of a transfer of power from the primal female deity to the Vedic male one. Vi?nu and Siva were later attributed serpentine qualities, which originally were inextricably connected with the Goddess in her manifestation as Siddh?svar?. Maury draws attention to the fact that Siva is depicted with serpents more often than Vi?nu. This, he says, should be understood in terms of Sivas Sakti, whether known as Parvat? or Rodas? ? a striking exception to the "flat, male-subdued" Saktis of Vi?nu and Brahma. Siva is the materialization of Sakti's energies, and she herself is not merely the female aspect of the male deity's power. Evidence for this, says Maury, can be found in certain epithets applied to Siva (Mrd?kanta = Lover and Husband of the Gracious and Compassionate One; K?livil?sin = Lover and Husband of the Black Goddess) (Maury 1969: 177). Another interesting aspect pf the snake is its characteristic association as n?gin? with the role of dv?rap?l?? gatekeeper of the temple. In the case of the Tnuggu, we have the serpentine pattern that serves as threshold keeper, and, to continue the analogy, the woman who draws the muggu in front of the domestic space is the dv?r?pal? of the house. The snake designs, then, are no mere exercises in ornamentation, but tokens of an ancient and undying devotion. The evolution of the snake figure in Hindu iconography shows a development from abstract zoomorphic and emblematic depictions, in the early period, to theomorphically explicit naga and n?gin? likenesses in later centuries. The original abstract nature has been preserved, however, in the muggu. The lotus The lotus shares many of the characteristics of the serpent. Stylized, or woven into ornamental patterns, it appears in temple walls and ceilings, in field altars, and on the fa?ades and in front of secular dwellings. The lotus announces the transcendence of the feminine. It is at once the epitome of beauty and the very place of emergence of the Goddess Laksm?, she who reveals the nature of the lotus.40 Since the flower itself is not native 39.

She took refuge in the primordial waters, whence she reappeared in all</page><page sequence="24">94 RES 10 AUTUMN 85 to the regions from which Indo-Aryans came originally, one can assume that the lotus and the various designations applied to it, including its identification with the Goddess and the cosmic yoni, must have been indigenous to the Indian plains and pre-Aryan. Moreover, as Kuiper himself has observed, the Vedic Aryans had no lotus myth, and this one "obviously originated in autochthonous circles and only a later stage of the process of Indianization can account for its being grafted on the Vedic myth" (Kuiper 1983: 27). The interpretation of the lotus flower as the cosmic yoni suggests the attribution of eternal regenerative powers to the Goddess, from whom all life proceeds. This characteristic was then brought down from the metaphysical plane and reduced to terms of mundane comfort: "From infinite life-sustaining and life perpetuating energy to physical abundance and worldly prosperity. From auspiciousness to good fortune" (Maury 1969: 103).41 The life-sustaining energy of the Lotus Goddess is reminiscent of the same quality normally attributed to Vi?nu, who in the Hindu Triad is the life-preserver, in contradistinction to Brahma, the creator, and Siva, the destroyer. Did a transfer of power actually take place, a "masculinization" of female energy in accord with brahmanical patriarchal notions?42 It may then have been expedient to relegate Laksm? to a prototype for the passive, male-subservient Hindu wife, her own originally intrinsic power now made to appear as but a reflection of the great God's bounty and infinite potency. The cosmic regenerative quality of the lotus is evident in the well-known creation myth of the thousand Elaborate domestic muggu with prominent lotus motif. Hyderabad, 1981. petal led golden lotus. The lotus is put forth by the cosmic waters: from it all life, cosmic and terrestrial, is engendered; into it everything, created and uncreated, will dissolve. Maury summarized the essence of the lotus thus: Though itself of ancient inception, the lotus emblem appears to have been an elaboration of a pre-existent simpler design: a floral figuration of the circle, always and everywhere the elementary ideograph of the female organ, subsumed in India by the term yoni. This role as the fundamental allegory of female sexuality1431 has endowed the flower with its aura of sacred mystery and imparted to its diagrammatic abstraction a dimension of the cosmic. Whether in hylic or emblematic form, the lotus has come to present the ultimate equation of female being and female magic: its petals enclose the enigma of generation and regeneration, its centre is the omphalos of the universe, the source and substance of life itself. (Maury 1969: 110) Manrjala The above description of the lotus symbol would be inadequate without considering its relation to the m?ndala. The m?ndala or yantra is a diagram that incorporates both the lotus and the intersecting triangles, circumscribed by the sacred square.44 Although unquestionably the metaphysical content of m?ndalas and yantras goes far beyond that of the muggu, many her splendour, floating on the petals of a lotus. The lotus thus signifies (in association with Lak?m?) beauty, prosperity, and happiness. Mcdonnel's dictionary, to which Maury referred, gives the following connotations to Lak?m?, the Lotus Goddess: laks = to observe, perceive, apprehend, hence Lak?m? as She who is Perceived. Lak?m? = Good Fortune, Dignity, Glory, Wealth, Beauty, Splendour, Auspicious Sign, Mark, Token (Maury 1969: 100). 41. Lak?m? is the presiding deity at the festival of Div?li. It is curious to note that worldly minded businessmen ritually lay out their account books of the preceding year, together with fresh, unmarked account books for the forthcoming year, in front of an ?mage or statuette of the Goddess Lak?m?. 42. Maury's book abounds with etymological analyses to illustrate this transfer, or the disparaging reduction of female creative potential into fear-inspiring, demonic forces. For example, Danu, wife of the sage KaSyapa, was once a manifestation of the Divine Feminine. This ?mage was later destroyed to make her the mother of the D?navas, the mythological transformation of the divine into the diabolical. 43. In Vatsay?na's K?mas?tra, the epithets "lotus-eyed," "lotus breasted," "lotus-faced," and "lotus-perfumed" appear regularly in his four categories of women. 44. The relation or geometrical interchangeability among square, triangle, and circle has been dwelt upon earlier.</page><page sequence="25">KiIambi: Toward an understanding of the muggu 95 scholars maintain that m?ndalas are also often used for decorative and protective purposes. The use of these m?ndalas in an overt, non-esoteric manner in itself points to an ancient indigenous heritage that can help us understand the common basis of belief that they share with the muggu. Thus, comparisons are inevitable between the metaphysical and philosophical over- and undertones of the m?ndala and the reasons for the practice of muggu ground drawings. Moreover, much more has been written about the symbolic import and metaphysical dimensions of the m?ndala, a magical diagram destined from its very inception to be a tool for meditation, than about the threshold drawings, an aspect of "popular art practised by women" and hence a less likely subject for the exploration of contemporary forms of ancient belief. The moment one mentions m?ndala and yantra, one is obliged to think of them with Tantrism and Buddhism as religious backdrops. While both diverge from orthodox Hinduism, a number of the symbols and underlying conceptions manifest a pan-Indian essence. Tantrism, particularly, is seen as a revival of indigenous traditions and beliefs ? the Feminine Principle once again reinvested in its former glory. That the Tantras have their roots in pre-Aryan soil is advanced by Maury, among others: Tantrism's symbology proves singularly eloquent in attesting the doctrine's indigenous source. It is remarkable not so much for its introduction of new elements as for its elaboration and reinterpretation of those pristine ciphers of female divinity, the serpent and the lotus. (Maury 1969: 188) Yantra is a specialized version of the m?ndala used in Tantrism. Zimmer describes the mechanism of the yantra thus: A yantra is an instrument designed to curb the psychic forces by concentrating them on a pattern, and in such a way that this pattern becomes reproduced by the worshipper's visualizing power. It is a machine to stimulate inner visualizations, meditations and experiences. The given pattern may develop a series of visualizations growing and unfolding from each other as the links or steps of a process, and works in two directions. Forward, as a course of evolution and backward, undoing the visions previously unfolded, restating in miniature the stages and aspects of the manifestations of the Absolute in the evolution and involution of the world. (Zimmer 1974) The striking similarity between this dynamic movement inherent in the yantra, which affords the "and" that Muggu in m?ndala form. Hyderabad, 1981. unites all apparent contradictions, and the conception not only of the mandata but also of the creative flux that ebbs and rises, M?y?-Sakti, is.evident enough. It is interesting to be reminded by Zimmer that yantra utilized in connection with Yoga represent those stages of consciousness leading from avidya to self-realization, in the fusion of brahman-?tman.45 For a description of the m?ndala and of the development of the lotus as mystical and metaphysical referent, I shall be quoting extensively from Tucci's sensitive portrayal of the theory and practice of the m?ndala. First and foremost a man?jala delineates a consecrated superficies and protects it from invasion by disintegrating forces symbolized in demoniacal cycles. But a man?jala is much more than a consecrated area that must be kept pure for ritual and liturgical ends. It is, above all, a map of the cosmos.1461 It is the whole universe in its essential plan, in 45. A brief return to the labyrinthine motif seems relevant here, in relation to the manrjala, evoked by the spiral movement of lines that intersect each other, yet convolute around each other, where the beginning fuses itself, after a meandering motion, with the end. The diagram itself is considered to represent the dynamics of the universe, its constant changeability ? now revealing, now deceiving ? being an ?mage of its continuity. The continuity, furthermore, seen in its purest essence, can be expressed in the fusion of brahman atman, and the path traced by the mystic within the diagram and within himself (that is, when the diagram is interiorized) is precisely the development from avidya (the dark labyrinth of ignorance where one is lost) to moksa, where the microcosm and the macrocosm are unified and are distinct only insofar as one moves from the centre to the periphery of the other in the reverse direction. 46. This brings to mind Beck's proposal of the fusion of body cosmos and temple, which I hold relevant for an understanding of the muggu.</page><page sequence="26">96 RES 10 AUTUMN 85 its process of emanation and of reabsorption. The universe not only in its inert spatial expanse, but as temporal revolution and both as a vital process which develops from an essential Principle and rotates around a central axis. (Tucci 1961:23) Tucci elucidates the universality of the m?ndala as both designating a consecrated space unifying earth and sky, macrocosm and microcosm, and constituting a protective and protected area. He even relates this conception back to the Mesopotamian zikkurats and to the plan of the Iranian ruler's Imperial City. In each case, there is a synthesis of the spatial dimension (cardinal points, direction, physical space) with the temporal (emanation and reabsorption, temporal revolution, cyclical movement, all strangely evocative of certain aspects of modern physics and cosmology): Such correspondences and theories, of Mesopotamian origin, accord well with primitive intuitions according to which the priest or magician marked out on the ground a sacred area. This, by the line of defense which circumscribes it, represents protection from the mysterious forces that menace the sacral purity of the spot or which threaten the psychical integrity of him who performs the ceremony; it also implies, by magical transposition, the world itself, so that when the magician or mystic stands in the centre, he identifies himself with the forces that govern the universe and collects their thaumaturgical power within himself. ... To this end, in ancient India, a vase was employed. . . . Five vases, indeed are placed in the five sectors of the m?ndala, one in the middle and one on each of the four sides.1471 A vase remains an indispensable adjunct in all those Hindu ceremonies designed to bring down the divine essence (avahana) so that it may be projected and take up its abode in a statue or other object. Such a "descent" takes place, first of all, from the celestial plane into the vase and then passes through the channel of the sacrifier. (Tucci 1961:24) Up to now, I have discussed the theoretical conception of the m?ndala and yantra, as set out by Zimmer and Tucci, and their relation with Tantrism and Buddhism. We have also seen possible connections with conceptions of space, time, consecration, union of the immediate and the infinite, the interiorization of the 47. Remember the use of the new mud pot placed in the centre of the muggu, whereby the sweet rice becomes consecrated; also, Siva's five faces, wherein the upward-looking face is also the central one. The emergence of the fictive vanishing line that terrestrial izes the cosmos unites earth and sky, thus enabling the permeation of the divine. divine essence and the merger between space (physical and "ultra-physical"), temple and cosmos. These are essential aspects of the belief syndrome underlying the use of the m?ndala and, in fact, also of the muggu, which is characterized by a great flexibility as to the "instruments" used to make it explicit. More specifically, one movement brings the belief object down to the level of "support of belief," and then another transforms this same "objectness" of the intermediary from support back into an object of belief. That object is now the entity to which a cult is directed ? deep sentiments (individual and collective) ? but at the same time, it also remains only a reminder of the cult entity itself, insofar as this one cannot ultimately be reified. A m?ndala is only a map of the cosmos. It represents diagrammatically (and to some extent it becomes) the dynamic and flux, the cosmic dance, the unity underlying diversity and the calm that subsumes unrest ? the cosmos itself. On the one hand, the m?ndala is not the cosmos ? infinite, transcendent, beyond definition. It remains just the map; it does not constitute the territory. On the other hand, because of the intensity of the belief invested in it and the concentration inherent in meditation, the m?ndala becomes the cosmos, is the cosmos. It receives the cult of the mystic (hence, it is a cult object), and at the same time it is interiorized. Its "practise" goes beyond fiction ? the fiction, for instance, that can accompany the cultic evocation of the dead (see Guidieri 1983) ? because it evokes but at the same time also is the object of evocation. Following the movements contained in the m?ndala and interiorizing the cosmic representation is, in the final analysis, a microcosmic cosmogony, where the mystic passes from the undifferentiated primeval state to one of manifested being, with all its dualities and contradictions, and then back to the realm of the "formless," albeit now made no longer frightening or chaotic. Kuiper's citation of Eliade on the nature of the yogic experience seems appropriate in this context: "The archetype of the 'action' (namely, in the Yoga) is the Creation of the worlds, the cosmogony. In a sense, the yogin repeats in his own person the transformation of the Chaos into a Cosmos" (Kuiper 1983: 126). Any support can be an intermediary in the belief process. Although the symbols that one uses and the form of the intermediary itself may have established referents ? whether in mythology, metaphysics, or mysticism ? the potency of the supports de croyance results from the individual's belief, which charges these</page><page sequence="27">Kilambi: Toward an understanding of the muggu 97 Muggu composed of intersecting triangles forming a square at the center. Hyderabad, 1981. supports of belief and thus renders them evocative. That is, one has to insist on personalized belief, a belief that is lived, "mystical realization rather than philosophical argument or religious experience rather than religious speculation" (Maury 1969: 3), if one wants to understand what belief in a painted diagram or the consecration through drawing of a space may be. A belief support implies a dyadic relation between the person who believes and "that which is believed," and between the infinite "suchness" and the immanent and immediate "suchness." In this sense, the description of the m?ndala complements that of the muggu. As already mentioned, Tucci has discussed the lotus as a metaphysical and cosmological referent, as cosmic yoni that incorporates and manifests eternal regeneration, as evocative of the Feminine Principle. A usual representation of this interior man?jala vision is a flower ? properly speaking the lotus. Its four or eight petals disposed symmetrically about the corolla symbolize the spatial emanation of the One to the many. In India, the lotus has been regarded as expressing a two-fold symbolism which may be called exoteric and esoteric. The first denotes creation in its widest sense, generated from the primordial seed of the cosmic waters, as in the myth of Brahma rising from the navel of N?rayana lying upon these waters.1481 The lotus is the earth itself lying upon those same waters and the prop of the universe. .. .[491 The second meaning of the lotus which has dominated the millennia of Indian religious experience is a spiritual one, the symbol of the other plane which reveals itself in the centre of the mysterious space (akasa) in the depths of the heart. The first creation is in space and time, the second starts from this limitation but, by transcending the process of becoming, accomplishes (through contemplation) that qualitative "leap" by means of which the spirit of the meditator finds itself transported into a different and more exalted sphere. (Tucci 1961) Acknowledging Jung's far-reaching recognition of the lotus and m?ndala images as archetypes deeply embedded in the human spirit, Tucci adds: Such visions and flashing apparitions occur through some mysterious, intrinsic necessity of the human spirit. ... The man?jala born thus, of an interior impulse became, in its turn, a support for meditation, an external instrument to provoke and procure such visions in quiet concentration and meditation. (Tucci 1961) While lotus is one symbol of the cosmic yoni, the downward-pointing triangle is another. The qualities of eternal regeneration and erotic creativity, the becoming and transcending, that is, M?y?-Sakti, is especially evoked by the Sr?-Yantra, a diagram much commented upon by Tucci, Zimmer, and other scholars: Such m?ndalas are made by four isosceles triangles with the apices upwards, and by five others with the apices downwards; they are of various sizes and they intersect one another. In the middle is a point, the bi?du, the mysterious matrix. These triangles are circumscribed by a first circle on which are drawn eight petals which symbolize the mystical lotus of creation [which we have mentioned above]; then follows another circle with sixteen petals; after that a three fold circular girdle (trimekhala) fitted into a square with as in a man?jala four openings towards the four cardinal points (bhupura). In this complex of triangles which serve to show the refraction of the original Sakti, while the four with apices upwards symbolize Siva. However, other authors, such as Laksmik?ra, read in the opposite way, that is to say, 48. Note that the cosmic waters are themselves feminine, and everything, including N?rayana, is but a manifestation of feminine ?akti. Maury has suggested this dynamic relationship between the "Lotus Goddess'Vcosmic yoni and M?y?-Sakti, "the former's latent in rapport with the latter's manifest energy; potential :: operative creativity; reproductive :: transformatory capability; unawakened expectancy :: erotic self-realization" (Maury 1969: 138). 49. The prop of the universe has other symbols as well ? the lotus stalk is one, and the noninverted fig tree another ? that serve to illustrate the cosmic axis that has its roots in the primordial hitl rising from the primeval waters. The godly counterparts of this cosmic axis are varied ? sometimes it is Indra who not only supports but at a certain point is the cosmic axis; at other times we have the ?mage of Varuna (who replaces ?esa) as the prop of the universe. For a detailed discussion, see Kuiper 1983: ch. 1, 3, 5, 6.</page><page sequence="28">98 RES 10 AUTUMN 85 as though the five triangles indicative of the Sakti had their apices upwards. But the difference is merely apparent, it depends, that is to say, on the phase on which the initiate fixes his attention. The downward-directed apices of the Sakti triangles are the tendency to fulfilment, while when they are turned upwards they indicate the contrary phase, that is the return. (Tucci 1961 :ch. 2) The mysterious matrix, the bi?du, as the centre of the Sr?-Yantra must be dwelt upon. It represents the focal area of psychic power and is a metaphysical point out of time and space, the "area" in which sam?dhi is experienced. It is a sacred symbol of the universe, written as a dot or the sign of zero.50 In reference to this bi?du, Zimmer adds: Most important is that the Absolute itself is not represented since it is beyond form and space and hence to be conceived of as the vanishing point or dot, the bi?du, amidst the interplay of all the triangles. The bi?du is the powerpoint, the invisible, elusive center from which the entire diagram expands. (Zimmer 1974) Maury, however, insists more on the Feminine Principle as the underlying symbolic nature of the bi?du. While talking of Emanation and Return, of the esoteric "content" of m?ndalas and yantras and hence of the images and symbols that ultimately (and perhaps also originally?) constitute the hidden reference of the muggu, one shouldn't omit mention of the slumbering serpent energy, the powerful and disquieting Kundal?n? Sakti, inherent in each being. Kundal?n?, which means coiled, is the name of a potent "occult" energy symbolized by a serpent having three and a half coils and sleeping with its tail in its mouth. Kundal?n? is referred to as the Goddess, an aspect of Sakti, and the arousal of her powers by someone unable to control them can lead to destruction. There are special techniques for the proper arousal and mastering of the serpent energy, and the aid of a guru is deemed a necessity. Here, once again, the union of the lotus and serpent takes place. When the aroused kundal?n? begins its upward journey in the subtle body of man, it passes through cakras or lotuses. As the kundal?n? moves upward, it strikes against the downward-facing lotuses in sequence, starting from the lowest, causing them to fold into themselves, reverse their orientation, and bloom upward. As each cakra is animated, there are different bodily reactions. The complete process involves the transfixing and reversal of the six cakras of the subtle body. When the kundal?n? reaches the highest (sahasr?ra), also indicated by a thousand-petal led lotus, it results in the flooding of the whole being with indescribable bliss. In the mystic (yoga) physiology, the spine (along which kundal?n? mounts) is the microcosmic (anatomical) counterpart of the cosmic axis. The lowest part, the Muladhara ("root-container"), is said to support the spine (Meru), which functions as the axis of the human body just as in cosmology Mount Meru is the axis mundi. . .. The serpent kundal?n? at the bottom of the spine is, accordingly, reminiscent of the close connection between the serpent and the Tree of Life in many cosmogonies. (Kuiper 1983: 126) The tree, at the center of the world and also of each human being, around which the great dragon coils, is also ideally at the center of each muggu, thus placing the house, every dawn, right at the heart of the Garden of Eden. Perspectives This collection of rather heterogeneous observations is only, of course, a beginning, a tentative laying out of feelers to understand the belief process underlying the making of the muggu and the rapport of the divine, to the objects/gestures that mediate between the divine and the human, and to the believers themselves. Whether such an understanding is truly possible today is open to question, especially when the one seeking to understand 50. Point zero ? a simultaneously fictive and real point that lends itself to many dimensions, from the centre of the m?ndala to the centre of the muggu, to the threshold as a space that is neither exterior nor interior. In this respect, the number five is also of tremendous significance. We have already noted the rapport with the four cardinal points plus the perpendicular vanishing line (the cosmic axis) and with the five faces of Siva. Tucci adds this: "In a m?ndala, the quinary grouping of ?mages and symbols is psychologically significant as well as indicating the four cardinal points that revolve round a centre (the askaram padma) ? the undecaying condition) which conditions them, thereby evolving a succession in time and space round itself. A m?ndala is, indeed, the All as reflected in the ego. The five points on it correspond to the five structural elements of the human personality, centred on the conscious principle, the kernel of the individual, the cause of samsara and also of the Return" (Tucci 1961 : ch. 2) ? another indication of the merger between body and cosmos.</page><page sequence="29">Kilambi: Toward an understanding of the muggu 99 is an outsider, either to Indian culture and the manner in which it expresses belief, or to belief itself, or to both. Much more could have been said: on each of the symbols that recur so frequently in the muggu patterns, on the act of inscription itself, on the women who make the drawings, on the more general need itself to draw magical diagrams on the ground, whether by women or by priests, Tantric or others. One also could have discussed the prescriptions laid out in religious manuals for the correct observance of ritual practice that include the use of such diagrams. The various aspects of the threshold drawings that have been mentioned (albeit insufficiently), however, point to a common and essential characteristic ? the muggu is primarily magical, protective, and auspicious in form and intent. Deeper analysis of the nature of this intent must await the opportunity to hear firsthand the ideas and conceptions of the contemporary anonymous authors of muggu. In many cases, of course, we shall be disappointed: complex and deep traditions can long survive inscribed in the magical continuity of ritual gestures without much awareness of their origins and reasons. One question, however, still needs some further comment. We were drawn to surmise a relation between meditational diagrams (m?ndala and yantra) and the muggu, and to refer extensively to the conceptions underlying the form, use, and symbolism of the first in order to deepen our understanding of the second. Formal similarities (for example, the inscription of a circular figure within a square framework, the geometrical stylization of the snake and lotus motifs) would not appear to be sufficient reason for such an assimilation. It seems relevant to recall in this respect the already mentioned and classic Indian distinction between the Great and Little Traditions (the former being sometimes associated with the learned and reflective few, and the latter with the ignorant and unreflective many) and to ask how the muggu should be seen in relation to these two categories. Of course, the fact that the muggu, unlike the m?ndala, are not "specialized" diagrams with an explicit meditational content, nor used by mystics, but are drawings (although magical and protective) made by women outside of any esoteric practice, might encourage us to think that they belong to the Little Tradition. However, such a hasty arranging into-slots of cultural "artefacts" that are still dynamically part of the Hindu culture would be misleading. In the view of one author, which we share, the simplifying Serpent ground drawing executed by the Pulluvan to cast out demons. From Thurston and Rangachari 1909. dichotomies (Great versus Littte Tradition, folk versus classical) "have obscured the fact that different aspects of Hinduism tend to be present in every instance of popular practice, explicitly or implicitly, coexisting without conflict by being located at different levels of cultural abstraction" (Morini 1982: 255). The different levels of religious thought are indeed woven into the fabric of sociocultural life in Hindu India, and the feedback from the temple to the people is constant. Any aspect of Hindu life tends to have religious and hence metaphysical overtones, if only because it has been incorporated into the canonical description of proper social life given in old and popular Hindu manuals, including the sacred texts. Therefore, it seems reasonable to link the different facets of the muggu (temporal, spatial, structural, and so forth) with analogous mythological and metaphysical notions. As Morini puts it: Every institution within the Hindu tradition must articulate in some way with the general metaphysical schemes of the culture. The institution is then constituted as a framework within which individual experience can take a directed form and meaning. ... In one popular practice we can identify several different aspects of Hinduism (i.e., text, ritual and experience), the analysis of which reveals several levels of cultural abstraction. (Morini 1982:267) In this perspective, the muggu itself can effectively be seen as constituting a sort of microcosmic, plastic</page><page sequence="30">100 RES 10 AUTUMN 85 Domestic muggu in refined modern floral style. Hyderabad, 1981. temple, a miniature temple, not only in intent, as an area consecrated by the permeation of the divine within the muggu and from there into the house, but also in form.51 The fictive vanishing lines that connect the cosmological and the spiritual belief structures catalyze the descent of the divine, however it may have been invoked.52 They permit the interiorization of what lies beyond the grasp of the human mind and its connection with what lies within the human being, the union of macrocosm and microcosm, the oneness that runs under all temporal manifestations, but whose presence to consciousness must constantly be reactivated. Finally, this same unifying process can also be seen with reference to the body or the temple; in Beck's terms, the "merger of body, cosmos and temple" could 51. If one recalls the numerous allusions to the "transfer of power" from the Feminine Essence to male divinities and their human counterparts, male priests, the muggu as temple assumes another dimension. It is a relegation of the woman to a domestic space, wherein she is allowed to communicate with the divine, but on a private level, in contrast to the temple as a public place of worship. Even this concession to female prerogative in invoking what was originally considered Female Essence is filtered through brahmanical precepts that limit the gesture of drawing the muggu as a wifely duty, with the accompanying insistence that the first person to step on the muggu should be the husband. The muggu, then, which once perhaps had an explicit symbolic dimension or value connected to a much more prominent role of the feminine, now only implicitly evokes it. 52. That is, for instance, the name, mythological stories attached to it, concurrence with festivals expressly commemorating a certain deity or legendary event, and so forth. Muggu in coarse modern style. Hyderabad, 1981. then be extended to include a fourth aspect ? the muggu. About the temple, Beck writes: Temple compounds in south India are normally built on square spaces. Indeed, a large temple will often exhibit a whole sequence of concentric square areas each marked off by its own retaining wall. Entrance routes will pierce the centres of these just as they pierce the four outer edges of the ?deal city.1531 Generally, there will also be a progressive narrowing of temple space as the worshipper progresses from the outer, uncovered square compounds to inner, covered square rooms. As one moves towards the centremost shrine, then, one moves towards a geometrically central area, from light to dark, and from airy openness to a womblike core. Furthermore, the innermost chamber of a great temple should have the shape of a perfect cube. This is a kind of secret, enclosed space, lying at the heart of the main shrine. Indeed, it is called the garbhagrha (literally the "womb" room). The image of the main temple deity will be kept in this room and great precautions must be taken to keep it "pure". Only the priest (not the worshipper) is allowed to enter this final chamber, and only the most correct and pious behaviour is sanctioned in this area. ... The square foundation presumed to lie under the garbhagrha is supposed to be equal in depth and breadth to a man standing, as if the patron of the temple could transform himself metaphorically into a yogi buried alive, akin to 53. Beck's reference to the ?deal city is interesting. The four cardinal points also have caste overtones. That is, the eastern side, for example, is reserved for the Brahmins and is also the traditional place for the deity.</page><page sequence="31">Kilambi: Toward an understanding of the muggu 101 Vastu as cosmic body underlying the temple. This symbolic tomb lies just below the symbolic womb, from where the regeneration continues vertically1541 beyond the temple's superstructure, thus unifying with the sky. . . . The final ritual is the eye-opening ceremony. To perform this ritual, the priest must climb to the top of the main sanctuary, and "pierce" a place on the central cupola with a needle. This ritual symbolizes the ascent of this new life through the entire vertical mass situated above the shrine. (Beck 1976:237-238) It would appear that the exploration of these symbolic correspondences could further yield stimulating insights into the constellation of meanings around the drawing of muggu, along with questions as to the difference of the practise in village and urban settings, and the extent to which muggu are or can be individualized in tradition and in contemporary practise. I hope to be able to go into some of these issues at a later date. 54. Note the symbolic reference to the Feminine Essence that enshrines and englobes divinity.
