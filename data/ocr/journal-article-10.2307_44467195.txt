King Wayne State University ABSTRACT The biodynamic response of the femur during passively restrained -G impact accele- ration is reported in this paper. Eleven unembalmed cadavers, ranging in age from 21 to 65 and weighing from 50 to 96 kg, were tested in a VW Rabbit seat with a passive belt and knee restraint. Sectioned parts of the VW knee bolster were placed about 130 mm away from the patella at the initiation of the tests. The height of the knee bolsters was adjusted individually in the eleven tests. Ten were set for loading directly through the patella. In one run, the impact was below the knee joint. The sectioned bolsters were mounted on a rigid frame and instrumented with triaxial load cells. A six-axis load cell was installed in the right femur. Photo targets were attached directly to the femur and tibia. Sled runs were made at 22 and 35 g. Only one cadaver sustained bilateral femoral frac- tures at 35 g. Bolster loads were twice as high as those reported previously and femoral loads averaged 65% of the measured bolster load. There was only one case of avulsion of .the posterior cruciate ligament for impact knee angles ranging from 83 to 119 deg. The shape of the bolster prevented initial tibial contact and lessened the risk to this ligament. Bending moments along the femoral shaft were found to be high. They should be considered in any new injury criteria for the femur. PATRICK (1) ET AL REPORTED ON THE DYNAMIC IMPACT tolerance of the lower extremities in terms of peak knee contact loads, ranging from 6.6 kN to 17.2 kN. The authors proposed a fracture threshold level of 6.2 kN. Later work by the same authors (2) suggested that this level should be raised to 8.7 kN. This work was performed with embalmed cadavers and multiple runs were made on the same test subject. Powell et al (3,4) impacted the knees of several embalmed seated cadavers , using a pendulum. The average failure load was 10.5 kN. Melvin et al (5) and Melvin and Stalnaker (6) were the first to perform impact tests on unembalmed seated test subjects with flexed knees, using a flat impactor. The surface was either rigid or padded with foam. Femoral fractures were produced at a minimum impactor load of 13.4 kN. Melvin and Nusholtz (7) subsequently conducted a series of cadaver sled tests during which various injuries were produced. Melvin et al (8) also conducted localized impactor tests on the patella. Average failure contact loads ranged from 4.6 to 5.9 kN. Impacts below the knee produced damage to the posterior cruciate ligament of the knee. Viano et al (9) impacted seated unem- balmed cadavers with a pendulum that had a flat or tapered padded surface. They pro- duced avulsion of the posterior cruciate ligament at an average value of 5 kN. When the impactor spanned the knee joint, pos- terior cruciate ligament avulsion was pro- duced at the average value of 7 kN. Viano and Culver (10) then performed sled tests, using a knee bolster restraint system. There was one below the knee impact which produced ligamentous injuries at a bolster load of about 4.0 kN. This paper describes a series of cada- veric sled tests designed to elicit the response of the lower extremities during whole-body frontal impact while restrained by a passive belt system. The aims of this study were to determine: 1. The effectiveness of the knee bolster as a restraint for the lower torso. 2. The axial and bending loads sustained by the femur using this restraint system. As a representative system, the 1983 Volks- wagen (VW) passive belt and knee bolster restraint was selected for testing. 6.859 0096-736X/ 85/ 9306-0859$02 • 50 Copyright 1985 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">6.860 R. CHENG, ET AL. METHODS The experimental design called for a relatively severe impact pulse. A typical 50 km/hr (30-mph) barrier equivalent velocity (BEV) deceleration profile for a 1983 VW Rabbit was obtained from VW of America as a guide for the sled tests to be conducted in this study. To determine the knee load for this profile in the laboratory, a 1983 VW Rabbit buck equipped with a passive restraint system was mounted on the WHAM III sled (Wayne Horizontal Accelerator Mechanism). A lightly embalmed cadaver was instrumented with a six-axis femur load cell at midshaft of the right femur and placed in the passenger seat. It was subjected to a series of runs at increa- sing deceleration levels until the VW barrier test pulse was reached. The femur load encoun- tered during the last run was taken to be the reference value for subsequent sled runs to be made on the same sled but using a test set-up instead of the VW buck. The difference between the two conditions was mainly in the knee bolster. The bolster in the VW Rabbit has a long span between attachment points across the left and right A-pillar. Its stiffness is considerably less than that of the short sections used in the sled test set-up. SLED TEST SET-UP - All tests were run on the WHAM III deceleration sled. A photograph of the test set-up is shown in Figure 1. The test subject was seated in a regular VW Rabbit bucket seat. The upper and lower anchor of the shoulder belt were located in the same relative position to the seat as that of the VW interior. A specially built frame was used to position the upper belt anchor in the desired location. Two sections of production 1983 VW knee bolsters each 238 mm long, were used to provide lower torso restraint. A triaxial load cell was placed behind each section to support the bolsters and to measure the knee impact force. The height of the bolster could be adjusted along the rigid supporting frame to match the knee height of the test subject. The anterior-most point of the patella was set at a distance of 130 mm from the bolster and the distance between the two patellas was about 280 mm. A toe board was provided to support the feet. Figure 2 is a schematic of the sled test set-up showing a 60-deg knee angle for the seated subject. It also shows the convention of signs used to identify femoral and knee bolster loads. The y-axis in each case is directed laterally to form the third axis of a right-handed coordi- nate system. A cross-sectional view of the VW knee bolster is shown in Figure 3. INSTRUMENTATION - Each unembalmed cadaver was instrumented with the following accelerometers and load cell: Location No. of accelerometers Head (crown) (3-2-2-2 configuration) 9 T1 (spinous process 3 T12 (spinous process) 3 Pelvis (sacrum S2) 3 Chest (upper and lower sternum) 2 Right and Left 4th rib (lateral) 2 Right and Left 8th rib (anterior-posterior) 2 Shoulder (acromion) 3 Femur load cell (right) (6 axis - 3 forces and 3 moments) 1 The arterial system of the cadaver was pres- surized by normal saline by means of a Foley catheter, the end of which was located in the aorta above the diaphragm. A vent tube was inserted in the brachial artery. Just prior to a run, the catheter balloon was pressurized to block the flow below it. Saline was pumped into the body until it flowed out of the vent tube. The vent was then clamped, thus insuring that the system above the blockage including the head, was filled with saline during the test. The lung was care- fully drained of any fluid and then aerated repeatedly with room air prior to the test. It was not pressurized. The femur load cell was installed at midshaft by first removing a length of bone equal to the load cell. Approximately two inches of the two ends were then cleaned and the load cell positioned axially along the femur. Dental acrylic was used to fill the voids to ensure good contact between the femoral ends and the end caps. Figure 4 shows the one femoral end and the end cap potted in dental acrylic and clamped to the load cell. An ordinary hose clamp was used. The load cell was basically the same as that described by Cheng et al (11). Photographic coverage consisted of a lateral and overhead high-speed camera viewing the entire test set-up. In addition, there was a close-up camera placed onboard the sled to monitor the impact of the right knee with the bolster. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN - The experimental series consisted of 11 runs which was divided into 3 principal phases. Ten of the 11 runs were made with the knee impacting the bolster at its design height and one was made with the bolster acting as a tibial restraint, simu- lating a tall occupant. The three groups of runs were as follows: 1. Four runs with a 100-deg knee angle, simulating a 50 km/hr BEV impact (22 g) 2. Two runs with a 60-deg knee angle, simu- lating a 50 km/hr BEV impact (22 g) 3. Four runs with a 60-deg knee angle, simulating a higher g-level run (35g)* The low knee bolster run was made at a low knee angle of 100 deg simulating a 50 km/hr BEV impact. Four of the runs were made with the left posterior cruciate ligament instru- *The pulse chosen was almost identical to that used in a previous cadaveric study by Cheng et al (12) in which a pre-deployed airbag was used.

It was an attempt to measure ligamentous tension but the trans- ducer was too large and interfered mechanically with the condyles. The data were thus erroneous and not reliable. CADAVERIC SPECIMENS - Cadaveric specimens were provided by the Department of Anatomy of Wayne State University through the Willed Body Program.** The specimens were selected based on age and cause of death. The age limitation was 65 years and death was presumed to have occurred without a prolonged period of bed rest or due to a debilitating disease. The age range of the cadavers used was 21 to 65. Pertinent information is listed in Table 1. Each specimen was examined radiologically for pre-existing fractures and other anomalies. Each knee was given a posterior and anterior drawer test to check the integrity of the cruciate ligaments. Anthropometric measure- ments were made prior to the installation of accelerometers . RESULTS GENERAL RESULTS - The two deceleration pulses used in this test series are shown in Figure 5. Their nominal peak values were 22 and 35 g. The lower level impact simulated knee loads encountered by a cadaver during a 50 km/hr barrier impact of a VW Rabbit. In general, there was a preponderance of rib and sternal injuries with only one posterior cruciate avulsion and bilateral femoral frac- tures in one cadaver. Table 2 lists all of the injuries identified at autopsy. High- speed movies showed the knees engaging the bolster squarely, bringing the lower torso to rest. The upper torso was held back by the shoulder belt, resulting in hyperflexion of the head and neck and severe deformation of the thorax. During rebound, the cadaver was pushed into the seat back before coming to rest. The close-up of knee impact with the bolster was used to obtain the initial and impact knee angles. The data are listed in Table 3. PHASE 1 RUNS - For an initial knee angle of 100 deg, the knee angle at impact ranged from 100 to 119 deg. There was one avulsion of the posterior cruciate ligament (Run No. 20) but no femoral fracture. The knee impacted the bolster first followed by tibial contact. A set of sequence photographs is shown in Figure 6 for this group of tests made at 22 g . Table 4 lists some of the knee and femoral loads for these runs. A typical curve for the resultant **The protocol for the use of cadavers in this study was approved by the Human and Animal Investigation Committee of Wayne State Univer- sity.

Resultant left and right knee bolster loads are shown in Figure 8 for the same run. Figure 9 shows upper and lower belt loads. PHASE 2 RUNS - These runs were made at the same g-level as that in Phase 1 but the initial knee angle was changed to 60 deg. The knee angle at impact was 87 and 107 deg for the two runs. No knee injuries were found at autopsy. Knee impact appeared to precede tibial impact and the lower extremity forces and moments were generally higher than those in Phase 1. The peak data are given in Table 5. PHASE 3 RUNS - The impact g-level was increased to 35 g for this phase, with the initial knee angle maintained at 60 deg. The knee angle at impact varied from 83 to 106 deg. In Run No. 24, bilateral femoral fractures were found involving both the shaft and the two condyles. The right patella was also fractured. The crushing of the bolster was more severe but no ligamentous damage was observed. A set of sequence photographs is shown in Figure 10, while typical resultant femoral and knee bolster loads are shown in Figures 11 and 12 respectively. The belt loads are shown in Figure 13. The peak data are listed in Table 6. For the low knee bolster impact (Run No. 19), there was no ligamentous injury. The peak data for this run are shown in Table 7. DISCUSSION The VW knee bolster in 1983 Rabbits appears to be a well-designed biomechanical restraint for a passive belt system. Viano et al (10) indicated that . . . "low extremity restraining load should be directed at the femur in the knee and not at the lower leg . . . and that (9) • . • the primary load acts through the femur and not through the tibia or across the knee joint." In the tests reported here, the load was applied at the patella across the knee joint and the new VW bolster design permitted simultaneous femoral and tibial contact and avoided initial contact with the tibial tubercles. As shown in Figure 3, the bolster profile is wider at the top and is a good knee restraint for average-sized occupants. The impact knee angle needs to be much less than 90 deg before the posterior cruciate ligament is at risk. It is thus a suitable restraint for compact cars, with limited leg room. In fact , for such cars , it can also be an effective lower torso restraint for an air bag restraint system. The measured peak knee bolster forces were approximately twice the magnitude of those reported by Viano and Culver (10). The peak resultant femoral forces were found to range from 62% to 87% of the peak bolster force, with an average of 65%. The average resultant femoral force at 35 g was 8.25 kN. Only one cadaver sustained bilateral fractures at that g-level. The principal component of</page><page sequence="4">6.862 R. CHENG, ET AL. this resultant was axial (z-component) . The lateral component (y-axis) was small because the abduction angle between the femoral axis and the direction of impact was 5 deg or less. The vertical tangential force (x-component) averaged 1.0 kN for the four 35-g runs, and was the principal contributor to the moment about the y-axis (lateral axis). The average moment (My) about a lateral axis measured by the 6-axis femoral load cell was 86 N.m for the 22-g runs. This moment is of course dependent upon the location of the sensor and is not a standard or maximum value associated with the resultant force. However, Viano and Stalnaker (14) have showed that tensile stresses resulting from these bending moments are the principal cause of fracture of compact bone. Cheng et al (11) estimated that the tensile stresses due to a bending moment of 45 N.m were three times as high as the compressive stresses due to an axial load of 5 kN. It is recommended that the effect of bending be examined in the development of new injury criteria for the femur. The observed difference in femoral and knee loads was found to be proportional to body mass, indicating that this difference is principally inertial. Table 8 lists the data and the ratio of the observed difference and body mass. The average value of this ratio is 4.65 with a standard deviation of 0.66. Data from Run 21 was not used in the calculation because the impact was asymmetric and the right knee load was considerably higher than that on the left, as shown in Table 5. CONCLUSION 1. The knee bolster should be designed to slope away from the knees of the occupant to prevent premature loading of the tibia. 2. Femoral forces and bending moments have been measured in cadavers for the first time, for frontal impact. 3. The measured resultant femoral load at 35 g ranged from 7.3 kN to 10.4 kN, with an average of 8.25 kN. One of the 4 subjects sustained bilateral fractures at this g-level. 4. The measured bending loads were not insignificant. Since compact bone is weak in tension, new injury criteria should include the effect of bending. REFERENCES 1.
