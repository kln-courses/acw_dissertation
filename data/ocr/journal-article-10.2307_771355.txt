<plain_text><page sequence="1">GASTON LACHAISE (Continued from page 7) Both figures have indeed in the highest degree the pride and unap- proachableness which make explana- tions so difficult. Both have a sort of entogeneric vitality, a sense of be- ing full of blood and breath, a look of being pneumatic but certainly not deflatable. And both are of heroic mould, though the later is about half again as tall as the life-sized earlier one. Beyond this, there are differ- ences. From the extraordinarily long time spent upon it, the first has gained the look of being dzurch komnponiert: there is no point of view from which the insistent flow of lines is not satis- factory. The figure loses, though, by being a little self-conscious. Its forms are not so exaggerated as those of the later work, but its state of mind and to some extent its pose are mannered. Yet its mysterious grandeur and its godlike bearing, together with its poly- faciality, make it hard to surpass. The second figure is definitely bad from one point of view: the left side is clumsy when seen at right angles. This question of unifaciality versus polyfaciality, which Stanley Casson has discussed, cannot be settled on merits. Despite its fault from one point of view, the later work is cer- tainly a polyfacial composition. It is also a very compact one. Its articula- tion is much more emphasized than that of the early Woman, who has a certain blurriness which may be a subtle way of making transitions. The later Woman has hardly a transition about her, every ample feature being firmly marked. This is a dogmatic exposition of organic structure. It would be useless for anyone to argue, for instance, against the stylizations: the luxurious wasp waist, the heart- shaped abdomen, and the enviable calves. The whole thing seems in- arguable; one may analyze and an- alyze without discovering what is the disquieting ingredient in this richly satisfactory complex. Perhaps it posi- tively requires the presence of the companion figure, the colossal Man. The complementary nature of these figures, as of the group newly shown, is as far removed as possible from the distressful anthropomorphism of Ro- din's Kiss. Yet the fact that there is in the Standing Woman of 1930- 1934 a disturbing quality which is absent from the Standing Woman of 1912-1927, may be taken to justify Lachaise's own belief that the earlier sculpture was both the kernel and the summation of his work. For the pres- ent, let it be so. ARTISTS' CONGRESS The League of American Artists was formed at the conclusion of the first American Artists Congress in New York City on March 16 as a national organization to advance art- ists' economic rights and defend their freedom of expression in cooperation with other groups working toward that end and other organized groups engaged in the struggle against war and fascism. Out of the country-wide represen- tation in the congress was elected an executive committee of forty mem- bers, including Nicolai Cikovski of Cincinnati, Ohio; Robert White of Cedar Rapids, Iowa; George Biddle, of Washington, D. C.; Philip Kaplan of Cleveland; Beniamino Bufano of San Francisco; John Howard of Santa Fe, New Mexico; Joe Jones of St. Louis; Walt Speck of Detroit, and among New York artists, Paul Man- ship, Stuart Davis, William Gropper, Rockwell Kent, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Alexander Brook, Max Weber, Arnold Blanch, Margaret Bourke-White, and Aaron Douglas, Negro artist. In the public meeting which opened the congress at Town Hall on Friday evening, February 14, the gathering had unanimously adopted a resolution offering by George Biddle, president of the Mural Painters Society, pledging refusal to participate in the exhibi- tion of art to be held in concurrence with the Olympic Games in 1936, and urging "all other American art so- cieties and individual artists to refuse to exhibit in Germany, as a protest against the spiritual intolerance and suppression of free thought, which the present German Government not only condones, but openly boasts of." A plea by Aaron Douglas, in his paper on "The Negro in American Culture", for support of the Negro people in their struggle against dis- crimination and for economic and cultural equality met with an en- thusiastic response. Subsequently a resolution was passed hailing the first Negro Congress in Chicago. Out of the discussions and papers in the following sessions, centering around social, esthetic and economic problems of artists, resolutions were adopted condemning the reported ban- ning of Sinclair Lewis's motion pic- ture "It Can't Happen Here"; urging the extension of government art projects on a permanent basis adequate to meet the needs of all unemployed artists, and supporting the further building of artists' unions throughout the country as the best means of ad- vancing toward that objective. Dis- patching by the government of artists into CCC camps was sharply disap- proved. Organization of art teachers and students along progressive lines was also advocated. The resolution intro- duced by Katherine Schmidt on be- half of the Society of Painters, Sculp- tors and Gravers asking artists not to exhibit in museums that refuse to pay rental for the use of art works was accepted. Reports by the famous mural painter J. C. Orozco and by David Siqueiros, two of the eight Mexican delegates to the convention, on prob- lems of organized Mexican artists in relation to their social situation were enthusiastically received. In outlining the sphere of activi- ties of the new organization, Stuart Davis pointed out that it could be a powerful agent in stimulating the awakening social consciousness of art- ists and impelling them toward the collective effort essential to realiza- tion of their needs. Among the specific activities planned are the organizing of exhibi- tions against war and fascism, sym- posia and lectures on artistic questions of most immediate import, publication of a journal, cooperative efforts for distribution of mechanically repro- duced art works on a mass scale, etc. While the executive committee will meet in New York City, groups of five or more members in other re- gions will be recognized as autonomous units developing their own activities within the general outline determined by the national organization. All members of the Congress are automatically eligible for membership in the League of American Artists, and new applications are being con- sidered on the same basis as those for the congress.
