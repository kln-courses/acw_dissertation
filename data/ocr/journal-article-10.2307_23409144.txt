The Congress attracted more than fifteen hundred participants from more than fifty coun tries and offered a scientific program intended to direct the concentrated efforts of scholars, scien tists, members of the business community, and government leaders to the dynamic processes of change as they affect the Pacific region. The 1991 Congress was a historic one for the arts. For the first time, the Pacific Science Congress opened up a major portion of the conference to the humanistic and sociological dimensions of the sci ence. 1 he theme Science and Culture brought rorth a wide range of symposia that addressed such con cerns as scientific change in the Pacific, the cultural construction of knowledge, educational issues, tech nology and cultural change, and the forest economy of the Pacific region. On Friday, 31 May 1991, morning and afternoon sessions presented under the section Cultural Issues in a Changing Pacific focused specifically on the arts. The morning session was sponsored by the Pacific Arts Association and was titled, "The Museum and Cultural Center as a Focus for Pacific Arts." Session chair was Jane Freeman Moulin. Sergio Rapu served as moderator. The first group of papers addressed the topic An cient Traditions in a Modern World. Carmen Chigiy's paper on "Traditional Dance in Modern Yap," presented by Barbara B. Smith, described the role of the Catholic church in both conserving tra ditional Yapese dance and providing a stimulus for the creation of new dances in traditional style. An accompanying videotape demonstrated the perform ance of a dance for the 1989 Christmas Midnight Mass and for a traditional "hanging-up" ceremony. ç;,wi iu;ii prcfrnmc rpnnrr nn "TKp \ /f 1 rr\ 1 iamc Tc_ r 1 lands Rock Art Project" explored anthropomorphic petroejyph figures, especially the face motifs known as mata kotnoe.

The second portion of the session was directed to The Role of the Museum and Cultural Center in Arts Education. Julia Harrison's paper on "Museum Ex hibitions as Cultural Performance" presented her performance model for viewing museums and the work they do. She applied this model to three differ ent exhibitions related to the Pacific—the Honolulu Academy of Arts, Bishop Museum's Hawaiian Hall, and Bishop Museum's Discover exhibition—and analyzed the processes bv which a museum con structs images of others. John Enright's struggles with issues of cultural rhetoric and administrative support were evident in his paper, "Rhetoric and Reality: The Frustrations of Cultural conservation in American samoa, n i^ase study.
