<plain_text><page sequence="1">Poetry as Pure Act: A Coleridgean Ideal in Early Victorian England Lawrence Poston The issue confronting the emerging generation of poets on the landscape of the 1830s, as critics like Arthur Henry Hallam saw it, was how to achieve a "pure" poetry which was not detached from moral considerations but in which moral and aesthetic issues were so perfectly fused that the resulting poem could not be dissected into separate hemispheres. The sources of this position, at least in its English statement, may be found significantly if not exclusively in Coleridge's theory of poetry and his theology; and the road that leads, however sinuously, from Coleridge to Tennyson passes through Cambridge, where the disciples Julius and Augustus Hare, clearly with Aids to Reflection in mind, published their own Guesses at Truth two years later in 1827, where F. D. Maurice attended Julius Hare's lectures on the Greek drama and Plato and subsequently embarked on his own energetic defenses of various of the romantic poets in the Athenaeum, and where the Apostles debated literary and philosophical issues during much of the same period. Outside Cambridge, too, the search for such a poetry was taken up by W. J. Fox and John Stuart Mill, whose interest in the emerging science of mind was to represent a transposition of Coleridgean theories of the imagination into a modified utilitarian key. In the line of development which is our subject here, theories of the imagination which stressed the unity of thought and feeling in poetry and became the groundwork for an ideal of lyric compression in poetry proved to be hospitable to a post-Romantic poetry which sought to incor- porate new ways of articulating experience. I In a letter of August 8, 1820, to Thomas Allsop, Coleridge quoted Wordsworth's lines, "The thought of Death sits light upon the man / That has been bred and dies among the Mountains." He went on to express a fear that "this like some other few of W's many striking passages means less than it seems, or rather promises, to mean." After providing some further examples, Coleridge observes that this inferred dependency of the human soul on accidents of Birth-place &amp; Abode together with the vague misty, rather than mystic, Confusion of God with the World &amp; the accompanying Nature-worship ... is the Trait in Wordsworth's poetic Works that I most dislike, as unhealth- ful, &amp; denounce as contagious: while the odd occasional introduction of the popular, almost the vulgar, Religion in his later publications (the popping in, as Hartley says, of the old man with a beard) suggests the painful suspicion of worldly prudence, (at best a justification of masking truth (which in fact is a falsehood substituted for a truth withheld) on plea of Expediency) carried into Religion.' Coleridge's ensuing allusion to Wordsworth as the Janus-faced Spinoza/Dr. Watts wittily clarifies the character of the passage. Coleridge is attacking two different manifestations of the same tendency in Wordsworth: on the one hand, the lack of concreteness in his imagery, derived from a vagueness of theology; on the other hand, a spurious precision in his resort to "the popular, almost the vulgar, Religion." 1/ Collected Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ed.

One recognizes here Coleridge's characteristic distrust of poetry which is merely notional, a series of versified thoughts about things rather than, as he put it in the Biographia Literaria, "the coincidence of the thought with the thing."2 Looking back to the neoclassical poets and comparing them with his contemporaries, Coleridge found that, while the former all too often sacrificed precision to intellect and wit, the latter resorted to "the glare and glitter of a perpetual, yet broken and heterogeneous imagery, or rather to an amphibious something, made up, half of image, and half of abstract meaning" (BL, 1:24). Coleridge's complex and densely allusive theory may be looked upon, from one perspective, as an effort to banish that "amphibious something" from poetry. From Schelling, as Shawcross long ago pointed out, Coleridge derived support for his own belief that art resolves "an infinite contradiction in a finite product," a process validated by and grounded in-and hence not merely a metaphor for-the historical fact of the Incarnation. In Aids to Reflection, in the twelfth of the "Moral and Religious Aphorisms," he declared that "there is something in the human mind which makes it know . .. that in all finite quantity there is an infinite, in all measure of time an eternal; that the latter are the basis, the substance, the true and abiding reality of the former; and that as we truly are, only as far as God is with us, so neither can we truly possess (that is enjoy) our being or any other real good, but by living in the sense of his holy presence."3 The focus here is on living in, rather than thinking about, the pervasiveness of God; the reader's reflection is consequent upon a sense of holy presence rather than a conscious way of attaining that sense. And for Coleridge the appeal of the Gospel itself is its dramatization of historical fact, which is to faith what the poetic image or representation is to the poem. It is definitely not, in other words, one-half abstract meaning: "The Gospel is not a system of theology, nor a syntagma of theoretical propositions and conclusions for the enlargement of specu- lative knowledge, ethical or metaphysical. But it is a history, a series of facts related or announced. These do indeed involve, or rather I should say they at the same time are, most important doctrinal truths; but still facts and declarations of facts" (Aids, p. 203). Facts and truths are identical, but the truths do not make a system; rather, they embody a method of apprehension by focusing eternal verities through a narrated web of finite events. It is not only pointless but dangerously misleading to attempt to disentangle Coleridgean theology from Coleridgean poetics; they are part of the same fabric, threads of a common design. Aids to Reflection says much on language which is as apropos to the study of poetry as to the study of the Gospels. "The word of God is spoken to men, and therefore it speaks the language of the children of men," Coleridge states at the beginning of a series of closely reasoned paragraphs on religiosymbolic language (p. 121). Language focuses meaning, language that is not merely figurative but analogous, reducing to a bare minimum any residue of 2/Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Biographia Literaria, ed. James Engell and W.

Earlier, in The Statesman's Manual, Coleridge had described allegory as "a translation of abstract notions into a picture," metaphorical language as an expression of similarity between different things in order to provoke gratitude or awe rather than to make an act apprehensible, and analogous language as an expression of "a thing, power, or principle in a higher dignity" by the same "thing, power, or principle in a lower but more known form." Thus the statement in John 3:6, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh; that which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit," is to be understood as an incarnation of the truth in apprehensible form rather than merely as a metaphor.4 Birth, as Coleridge explains later in Aids to Reflection, is the middle term between flesh and spirit, "the punctum indifferens, or nota communis" of thesis and antithesis, retaining simultaneously its familiar meaning and its spiritual meaning. Analogous language, in excluding that amphibious something which is half image, half abstract meaning, derives from our earliest state of consciousness and is thus invested by a spontaneity which precludes self-consciousness. Religious expe- rience is uniformly concrete in Coleridge's thought; the original temptation through which man fell was that which was posed by the "rational instinct . .. taken abstractly and unbalanced" (The Statesman's Manual, p. 61). Balance is attained when "Reason as the science of All as the Whole" is "interpenetrated by a Power, that represents the concentration of All in Each-a Power," Coleridge adds in one of his arrestingly lovely shifts out of pure abstraction, "that acts by a concentration of universal truths into individual duties, as the only form in which those truths can obtain life and reality" (p. 64). Whereas allegory requires an act of consciousness bringing together unlikes for the purpose of comparison, a symbol, constructed out of the writer's mind, reflects the unconscious working of a general truth. Allegory, or metaphorical or figurative language, is of the fallen world, symbol or analogous language of the prelapsarian. Symbols, Coleridge remarks in The Statesman's Manual, are "con- substantial with the truths, of which they are conductors," always participating in the Reality which they render intelligible (pp. 29-30). The symbolic language of poetry is thus by its nature sacramental, for it connects finite and infinite consubstantially, whereas in metaphor and allegory we are aware of those interspaces into which rhetoric intrudes itself. Certain passages in the Literary Remains comment on that amphibious something into which abstract meaning is allowed to creep.5 In a discussion of Shakespeare, Coleridge describes the imaginative faculty as "the power by which one image or feeling is made to modify many others, and by a sort of fusion to force many into one;-that which afterwards showed itself in such might and energy in Lear, where the deep anguish of a father spreads the feeling of ingratitude and cruelty over the very elements of heaven;-and which, combining many circum- stances into one moment of consciousness, tends to produce that ultimate end of all human thought and human feeling, unity" (LR, 2:55-56). Or again, paraphrasing Milton: "It is essential to poetry that it be simple, and appeal to the elements and primary laws of our nature; that it be sensuous, and by its imagery elicit truth at a flash; that it be impassioned, and be able to move our feelings and awaken our 4/ Collected Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, vol. 6, Lay Sermons, ed.

In comparing different poets with each other, we should inquire which have brought into the fullest play our imagination and our reason, or have created the greatest excitement and produced the completest harmony" (LR, 2:70). The emphasis in both passages on a unity derived from a single moment of consciousness and the eliciting of truth at a flash, the idea of poetry as not merely a conjoining of images and feelings but a fusion of them into an irreducible whole, validates (while it does not necessarily prescribe) an ideal of compression in poetry, a commingling of thought and feeling which defies and overrides the sequential operation of the reasoning faculties. In passages such as these, the Remains essentially extend the idea of the poet enunciated at the end of chapter 14 of the Biographia: The poet, described in ideal perfection, brings the whole soul of man into activity, with the subordination of its faculties to each other, according to their relative worth and dignity. He diffuses a tone, and spirit of unity, that blends and (as it were) fuses, each into each, by that synthetic and magical power, to which we have exclusively appropriated the name of imagina- tion. This power, first put in action by the will and understanding, and retained under their irremissive, though gentle and unnoticed, controul ... reveals itself in the balance or reconcil- iation of opposite or discordant qualities: of sameness, with difference; of the general, with the concrete; the idea, with the image; the individual, with the representative; the sense of novelty and freshness, with old and familiar objects; a more than usual state of emotion, with more than usual order; judgment ever awake and steady self-possession, with enthusiasm and feeling profound or vehement; and while it blends and harmonizes the natural and the artificial, still subordinates art to nature; the manner to the matter; and our admiration of the poet to our sympathy with the poetry. [BL, 2:15-17] Traces of this Coleridgean ideal are apparent in such widely disparate writers as F. D. Maurice and William James Fox. As an organ of the emerging Broad Church party, the Athenaeum, which Maurice briefly edited, was less distrustful than some of the more narrowly sectarian journals of the aesthetic component in the younger Romantics, while holding fast to Wordsworthian standards in matters of faith and morals. Maurice himself shared none of Coleridge's theorizing bent in literary criticism; his chief object was to enlarge his audience's conception of the proper role of poetry in moving society toward a greater good.6 Thus, for example, Maurice believed that Shelley, if he was no traditional theist, had religious principles superior to the anthropomorphic misconceptions of a personal Deity held by nominal Christians, and that Byronic misanthropy, though not in itself desirable, at least represented an activation of feeling that was to be preferred to passive selfishness.7 In fact, though for Maurice Wordsworth remained the great antidogmatist and "philo- sophical Christian" of the day in his acute sense of the divine nature and of those links by which men are united to each other,8 Shelley more clearly illustrated how thought and feeling actually fuse in poetry, how the imagination seizes the object without subjecting it to prior analysis or scrutiny. Shelley's mind, Maurice claims, was "more fundamentally and uniformly poetical, than that of any other poet, at least in our day." Maurice's definitions enable him to sidestep the narrowly moral 6/ For background, see Leslie Marchand, The Athenaeum: A Mirror of Victorian Culture (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1941). 7/[F. D.

Shelley, that is, "did not first look at an object as it seems to other men, and then consider how it might be represented so as to please in poetry; but his very perceptions seem to have been modified and exalted by his genius, and even his senses were inspired. It is on this account that his poems have such perfect unity of feeling. His labours do not show those inconsistencies which arise among other men, from the variable humour and energy of the moment. They are but a homogeneous fragment of the permanent substance of his mind" (Maurice, "Shelley," p. 193). Poetry thus becomes a medium in which thought and feeling are indistin- guishable, in which, as Coleridge had enjoined in his letter to Allsop, thought which can be isolated as rhetoric is held rigorously to a minimum. It is a curious irony of literary history that such a conception should be mustered to defend Shelley at the expense of Wordsworth, but in varying degrees Fox, Hallam, and Mill were to repeat Maurice's defense. Maurice's reappraisals of the Romantics were being published in the Athenaeum throughout 1828 and into 1829. The very next year found the sage of Highgate enshrined in a very different journal, the Westminster Review, where the Unitarian minister and writer W. J. Fox published an essay which foreshadows Mill's efforts to accommodate Benthamite and Coleridgean views.9 Fox's remarkable claim that Coleridge "is a Benthamite in his poetry" has been rather unfairly skewered by some commentators.10 But the attempt in his Coleridge essay is neither to force Coleridge into the Benthamite mold nor to water down Benthamism but, rather, to expand the intellectual horizons of his audience by forcing it to confront its own pretense of exclusivity. The principle of "greatest happiness," according to Fox, can surely be seen in the work of a poet who "writes under the controlling and dictating power of truth and nature, under the inspiration of his own profound convictions and emotions" (Fox, p. 3). The true poet relies not on "labored and minute description" but, rather, on a "felicitous selection of expression" which creates an incalculable enjoyment both "animal and intellectual" (Fox, p. 4). In casting the "charm of 'divine philosophy"' over all things, the poet breathes a power into his compositions in which poetic and religious inspiration are nearly identical and "fanciful reveries" merge with "the delight of holy musings." The dramatic subject of a poem like "Fears in Solitude" is really the train of the poet's own thoughts and feelings, unveiled for the reader. "It has been said that all the beings and events in the world are but the thoughts of the Deity: in this instance, the thoughts of the poet are beings and events" (Fox, p. 11). The power of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner lies in the truth and power of the emotions ascribed to the narrator. Perhaps this might be called Benthamism in the glow of Deity. Fox insists, in deference no doubt to his audience, that any "pure and true theology" be able to withstand "the strictest application of the rule of ratiocination to its evidences, and of the principle of utility to its influences." But this does not mean that Coleridge is a 9/[W. J. Fox], "Coleridge and Poetry," Westminster Review 12 (1830): 1-31. 10/George L.

Only portions of an ethical system in poetic form can be poetry, and it is better to have fragments, "sibylline leaves" which provide "glimpses of that clear profundity of truth," than a fully developed ethical system in verse (p. 23). Fox's discussion of Coleridge explores the relationship between poetry and logic. In poets, as opposed to mere versifiers, "the higher degrees of the ratiocinative and imaginative powers are usually found together," and Wordsworth "makes syllogisms of odes and odes of syllogisms." But poetry and philosophy are not separable ingredients; "there is no dissociating the true and the beautiful" in real art. Poetry is an embodiment of the poet's own thoughts in objects drawn from nature; thoughts are thus imaged, externalized. Genius is a quickening force, not a mechan- ical source of excitation: It can give a soul better than it can mould a body. It can animate the human frame with fire from heaven, like Prometheus; but if, with Frankenstein, it pretends to create, it only produces a monster. It must identify itself with nature; and then it will behold there its own thoughts and emotions already embodied: For all that meets the bodily sense, I deem Symbolical, one mighty alphabet For infant minds. [Fox, p. 8] Thus, in a poem like "Fears in Solitude," the poet's own broodings contain "the essence of all narrative, adventure, plot, and catastrophe." The poet instructs, through parable, not system, by making abstract truth pictorially concrete and by making his vision palpable. In Coleridge's case, this becomes a substitute for traditional drama because Coleridge "does not throw his mind into those of his characters, but absorbs theirs into his. They are, each and all, only Coleridge slightly modified." The ideal is the "graphic power" of a poem like The Rime of The Ancient Mariner, in which everything is brought out "by a few bold strokes" (Fox, p. 28). What Fox was searching for in the poetry of the rising generation was, to paraphrase Mill's later characterization of Tennyson, the power to make a few bold strokes do the whole work, and Tennyson's 1830 volume, which Fox reviewed in the Westminster Review the following year, seems to have reciprocally sharpened his own theorizing. Here Fox's concern for the operations of the imagination has now become one manifestation of a scientific movement of mind." Much of the review seems to be an implied sequel to Wordsworth's brief discussion, some thirty years before, of the relationship between poetry and science. The poet of today, Fox writes, has an inexhaustible stock of new subjects because of the pioneering work of "metaphysical science," which has made possible "the analysis of particular states of mind." By this standard, Tennyson's "Supposed Confessions of a Second-Rate Sensitive Mind" explores a subject as suitable to poetic description as is the shield of Achilles, and one far more relevant to the needs of the age. For the ancients, the external world had not yet lost its freshness, but present-day poetry is charting a new world within. "The power derived from science may be used poetically; and metaphysics may do as much for the poet as anatomy has done for the painter" (Fox, p. 214). The vitality of the last forty years of poetry may thus be evaluated, at least in 1 I/[W. J. Fox], "Tennyson's Poems," Westminster Review 14 (1831): 210-24.</page><page sequence="7">168 Modern Philology (November 1986) part, by the extent to which the new science of mind has permeated it, and the poet's choice of subject provides a gauge by which to measure.12 On a continuum from bad poetry, which evidences a lack of scientific sophistication, to good poetry, where such sophistication is abundantly present, Fox ranks Southey and Scott lowest, Byron and Campbell somewhat higher, Shelley higher still "had he not devoted himself to unsound and mystical theories," and Wordsworth and Coleridge highest of all, among the now-departing generation; but in Tennyson's little book we see a poetic outcome "as thoroughly and unitedly metaphysical and poetical in its spirit as any of them" (Fox, pp. 213-14). The premise in Fox's review of Tennyson is unaltered from that of the Coleridge essay the preceding year: poetry is emphatically no exception to the great law of progress. But for this very reason, he makes rather more of the demystification of poetry as an art than he had earlier. Perhaps the readers of the Westminster Review, who may have been thrown by the intrusion of a defense of Coleridge the year before, found some consolation in Fox's declaration now that "the machinery of a poem is not less susceptible of improvement than the machinery of a cotton-mill" (Fox, p. 210). The elements of poetry are reassuringly accessible to all men, "as widely diffused as the electric fluid." For Fox, the question is not so much whether poetry as whither: how the power which goes into its making may "bear some direct ratio to the progress of society" (Fox, p. 211). Since the poetical elements are as widely diffused as electric fluid, then we are not lamenting the departure of the poetical spirit but finding new metaphors for it. Dead forms cannot be revived, but the criteria of poetic vitality are the wedding of passion and philosophy, the genuineness and freshness of thought and feeling, and the sincerity of expression. Tennyson's poems are "ani- mated, touching, and impassioned," indeed, precisely because they are philosophical; because they are not made up of metrical cant and conventional phraseology; because there is sincerity where the author writes from experience, and accuracy whether he writes from experience or observation; and he only writes from experience or observation, because he has felt and thought, and learned to analyze thought and feeling; because his own mind is rich in poetical associations, and he has wisely been content with its riches; and because, in his composition, he has not sought to construct an elaborate and artificial harmony, but only to pour forth his thoughts in those expressive and simple melodies whose meaning, truth, and power, are the soonest recognised and the longest felt. [Fox, p. 214] It is difficult to imagine a more sustained use of loaded terms--sincerity, accuracy, rich in poetical associations, meaning, truth, power-but the passage does succeed in bringing together virtually everything by which Fox's conception of a major poet is defined. Furthermore, unlike Coleridge, Tennyson has the ability to project himself into any living thing, though here Fox warns that the poet's impersonative faculty may trap him into becoming a "poetical harlequin." Tennyson "has higher work to do than that of disporting himself among 'mystics' and 'flowing philosophers' "-the work of reform and human progress which makes up "the grandeur of a poet's destiny" (Fox, pp. 223-24). Fox's admiration of Tennyson reflects a willingness to reexamine traditional poetical genres and a sense that traditional verse drama as represented by a work like 12/"The old epics will probably never be surpassed, any more than the old coats of mail, and for the same reason: nobody wants the article." The "utilitarian spirit" has put an end to such superstitious adherence to anachronistic forms (ibid., pp. 212-13).</page><page sequence="8">Poston/ Coleridge and the Victorians 169 Philip van Artevelde is virtually exhausted. In his tribute to Coleridge, Fox had suggested that the end of poetry "is not gained by laboured and minute description." Rather, even the shortest of poems must have the interest attendant upon a narrative or drama. Poetic meaning resides in a kind of overbalance of enjoyment which is created by the interior drama played out in the poet's mind: "By dramatic we do not mean that the poet should have recourse to personae and dialogue; but he should at least employ those defined and contrasted feelings which will, in very narrow space, shadow forth the strivings of the external and literal drama; and his narrative will be not the less efficient for not being the current of outward circumstances, but that of the phantoms which are ever passing in long procession through the brain" (Fox, "Coleridge and Poetry," p. 5). But trains of thoughts and feelings, processions of images, may nonetheless be set forth in a poem in which the unity of mood is so self-contained and unbroken that it is impossible to break the experience it portrays into disparate elements. In a generally favorable review of Browning's Paracelsus, Fox was to complain that "the argument in the first part of the poem, and some subsequent passages, would bear condensation; and be improved, even in clearness, by the avoidance of an amplification and repetition, which is rhetorical rather than poetical."" Like Coleridge, then, Fox envisions a poetry in which heterogeneity, the intrusion of thoughts as thoughts which could be couched in prose, is kept firmly at a minimum, whereas the choice of the dramatic poem or verse drama, traditionally understood, endangers the execution of this ideal. The Tennyson review makes all the clearer the fact that Fox believes prose best accomplishes the handling of a long plot with adequate character development, description, and "a great moral lesson at the end": "A huge portion [of narrative poetry] always was prose in fact, and necessarily so; but literary superstition kept up the old forms after everybody felt them intolerably wearisome and soporific, though few dared be so heretical as to say so, until the utilitarian spirit shewed itself even in poetical criticism, and then the dull farce ended. This we take to be a great reformation. We have left off singing what ought only to be said, but the singing is neither the less nor the worse on that account." This ideal of pure song is most clearly realized in a poem like "Mariana" because, growing out of "a half sentence in Shakespeare," the poem manifests "no mere amplification; it is all production, and production from that single germ" (Fox, p. 219). The shift from a rhetorical to a biological trope, from amplification to germination, illustrates the distinction; in a plant, everything has its purpose. There is, of course, nothing necessarily Coleridgean in the idea of compression itself; the praise of economy of effect, as we have just seen, sometimes has a quite utilitarian ring about it, whether couched in Fox's call (in the Coleridge essay) for "a poem, however short," in which both narrative and dramatic interests figure, or in an earlier remark by another utilitarian that "the greatest poet, like the greatest painter, is he who can produce the most vivid impression by the smallest number of lines."'14 But, reverting to a distinction similar to that which he drew between Frankenstein and Prometheus, Fox tries now, in the passage already quoted, to explain the 13/ Review in the Monthly Repository (1835), reprinted in Browning: The Critical Heritage, ed.

That may perhaps be more likely of realization in a short poem, but again, compression is not necessarily a feature of the poem's length. The poem of Tennyson on which Hallam expended such lavish praise, "Recollections of the Arabian Nights," is by any standard something more than a short lyric, and in any case, it is difficult to make an abstract definition of what is short or long: short or long for whom? in the light of what purposes? Economy of effect is not necessarily the same question at all. When Mill, later in the same decade, was to say that "a long poem will always be felt . .. to be something unnatural and hollow," he may have been recalling that section of the Biographia in which Coleridge defines a poem as being distin- guished from a work of science by proposing pleasure rather than truth as its immediate object. Coleridge goes on to say that a true poem is not merely "a series of striking lines or distiches" which distract the reader's attention from the whole, nor "an unsustained composition, from which the reader collects rapidly the general result, unattracted by the component parts." Obviously there can be poetry in a work not defined by meter, or a work in which, as in the first chapter of Isaiah, it is truth, and not pleasure, which is the immediate object: "In short, whatever specific import we attach to the word, poetry, there will be found in it, as a necessary consequence, that a poem of any length neither can, nor ought to be all poetry. Yet if an harmonious whole is to be produced, the remaining parts must be preserved in keeping with the poetry" (BL, 2:10-11). The key phrase is "nor ought to be": it is not that a long poem is to be avoided, but simply that we must not have the wrong expectations about it. Rather, our criterion for judgment, like Hallam's judgment of "Recollections of the Arabian Nights," is that everything in such a poem be, in Hallam's phrase, in perfect keeping with the whole. If the nature of language itself makes it impossible to achieve the ideal of a perfect harmonization of word and thought, a complete banishment of what is amplificatory, rhetorical, and thus in some sense poetically heterogeneous, nonetheless it is at least desirable to relate as many "touches" as possible to the central idea. Fox's criticism, with its defense of interior psychological drama as something which, filtered through the consciousness of the poet, most nearly approaches the ideal of the irreducible in art, has significant reverberations for the history of genres as well as for poetical language. II The editors of what is the best modern school text of the Victorian poets, in reprinting Arthur Henry Hallam's 1831 review of Tennyson, suggest that it has importance both for the light it sheds on Tennyson's development and, more broadly, for its definition of conflicting, or competing, Romantic and classical schools of Victorian poets. To the latter belongs a critic like Henry Taylor, with his stress on severity of architectural design and the avoidance of poetical egoism; to the former belongs Hallam. As the editors themselves readily admit, however, Hallam's tilt is by no means unambiguous, and more recent scholarship has suggested that behind the essay lies not the elitist impulse of the future symbolists-Yeats's discovery of the</page><page sequence="10">Poston/ Coleridge and the Victorians 171 essay having perhaps raised more dust than it has cast light-but rather an attempt to describe a "poetry of sensation" which can still serve moral and social purposes.1 Here, too, Hallam's efforts supplement those of his acquaintances at the Athenaeum; like them, he is embarked on an eclectic search for insights from Shelley's poetry and Coleridgean poets with which he can set forth a regenerative role for poetry in the world. Any discussion of Hallam's poetics should begin by emphasizing the catholicity of his appropriation of the Romantics. It is perhaps best summed up in a letter of March 14, 1830, to Robert Robertson: "I see Galignani, that great benefactor to the human species, has just published an edition in one Volume of Coleridge, Keats, and Shelley. There has been a volume of Wordsworth before. The man who possesses these two has an inestimable treasure; truly 'The price of wisdom is above rubies.'"16 Over two years of reading lay behind this eclecticism. On August 26, 1828, Hallam reported to Gladstone that he had been reading Aids to Reflection and the Biographia, the latter at least, apparently, for the first time, for he was surprised at how "freely" Coleridge dealt with Wordsworth's poetry. On November 8 he reported to Gladstone that Guesses at Truth was "well worth a perusal."17 Such reading could not but help enforce in Hallam's mind the interdependence of religion and poetry. Thus he wrote on October 2, 1829, to Robert Robertson: Miss Robertson will permit me to doubt whether the separation she appears to make between Philosophy and Poetry on the one hand, and Religion on the other, is conformable to truth. It has seemed to me that Religion never gains by being, as Mdme. de Stael expresses it, "conduite hors du cercle des connaissances humaines, ' force de Reverences"; ought not the idea of God to be the sun of the system, penetrating with light &amp; heat every faculty and every knowledge? I never made the confession because I would not lie to my own thoughts, that I called for comfort to the sages and poets-and they gave me none. I owe them much, every way; chiefly because they stablish in my mind the pillars of that temple, in which Religion is the Cupola. [Kolb, pp. 329-30] Although elsewhere he called Coleridge "almost the only interpreter" of "the world of mystery, the only real world" (Kolb, p. 344), he also felt that Coleridge's career had failed to the extent that "his poetry and his philosophy had been allowed to damage one another."" In staking out a program for himself, he clung to a hope that such potentially warring elements might work harmoniously. Restless at the Cambridge regimen, he defended himself in a letter to Gladstone written March 18, 1829: Without prayer-meditation--and inquiry-I may be ruined; and these sedulous, and acting in concert. Now if these are so far from being promoted, that they are destroyed, by the consequences of mathematical application, am I to hesitate? So much for obstacles to be removed. But of the aidances, which I seek, you tell me, I am wrong in following the bent of my mind towards Metaphysics, &amp; Poetry. I have not left myself room to meet this with more than an assertion, that it is my firm conviction that these are not only the surest pillars, but even the constituting elements of the Christian Scheme. How indeed can it be otherwise, if the one be 15/ Walter E. Houghton and G. Robert Stange, eds., Victorian Poetry and Poetics, 2d ed.

[Kolb, p. 284] Yet even within a mathematical curriculum, Hallam found ample scope, and indeed official university approval, for his development. In 1831, Hallam won a Trinity College prize for an essay on Cicero which was published as a pamphlet the following year. The Cicero essay is so closely linked to his review of Tennyson chronologically and substantively that the two should really be regarded as complementary. Like the Tennyson review, the essay on Cicero is, given its author's youth, an astonishingly mature, rich, and suggestive work. Two of its themes in particular require notice: the nature of rhetoric, a topic with formal implications for what elsewhere Hallam has to say about the nature of poetry, and the philosophical weakness of Epicureanism, which bears on the morality of art. A starting point for both essays, however, is found in Coleridge's statement in the Biographia that "a poem is that species of composition, which is opposed to works of science, by proposing for its immediate object pleasure, not truth" (BL, 2:13). The first of these issues, for Hallam, turns on the relationship which oratory and poetry, considered separately, bear to truth. Of the two, oratory is the more dangerous instrument because it represents "the bringing of one man's mind to bear upon another man's will" and is thus destructive to contemplation, subjecting the hearer to the idiosyncratic passions of an individual. Eloquence, more broadly construed, results from having been persuaded oneself, whereas poetry requires calculation. The orator "begins by arguing where he ought to infer, and thus deceives himself. Then he pleads when he ought to state, and thus deceives others." Whereas the orator aims at the "commotion" of another's will, the artist-poet, musician, or painter-aims at the production of beauty: Poetry, indeed, is seductive by exciting in us that mood of feeling which conjoins all mental states that pass in review before it, according to congruity of sentiment, not agreement with conceptions; and it is with justice, therefore, that the Muses are condemned by the genius of a profound philosophy. But though poetry encourages a wrong condition of feeling with respect to the discovery of truth, its enchantments tend to keep the mind within that circle of contemplative enjoyment, which is not less indispensably necessary to the exertions of a philosophic spirit. We may be led wrong by the sorcery; but that wrong is contiguous to the right. [Hallam, pp. 150-51] Nevertheless, both artist and orator, inasmuch as they must invest their utterance with "one luminous mood, which extends its radiance over successive states," observe "the subtle law of Taste" and give that utterance harmony. The number of pure artists in either category is negligible: "Few souls are so finely tempered as to preserve the delicacy of meditative feeling, untainted by the allurements of accidental sug- gestion," and those who debase the persuasive art by pandering to ordinary desires for mere stimulus rather than promoting "the rare and difficult intuition of beauty" may be properly called rhetoricians rather than orators. Cicero occupies an inter- mediate rank, for although a powerful mind, he lacked "the vivid painting and instinctive sublimity" of a Demosthenes, and the reader is all too aware of the intellectual scaffolding, the "separate exertions of will" whereby his thoughts are assembled and consciously linked together. "Where understanding is more active in production than feeling, the predominance of rhetoric.., . over true oratory is the</page><page sequence="12">Poston/ Coleridge and the Victorians 173 certain result." The way is thus open for the meddling of the intellect, which thrives on the neglect of the "contemplative feelings" (Hallam, pp. 153-54). Thus, while oratory is intrinsically less fitted to the conveying of truth than poetry, both in their highest forms are capable of inducing what is variously called "contemplative enjoyment" or "the contemplative feelings," a state in which emotion and contemplation are harmoniously commingled. Second, in their lower forms the dross of "accidental suggestion" and the predominance of the logical, sequential faculties are potentially immoral and unpoetic influences, more accurately immoral because unpoetic; they provide an opening for the rational and hence, by inference, the skeptical faculties. We will return to the formal implications of this position in a moment. The second of the two issues is broached in terms of the centrality of emotion to moral vision. Here Hallam prefaces his discussion of the deficiencies of Epicurus's teachings by stating that "the man who is deficient in susceptibility of emotion will make a sorry survey of mental phenomena, precisely because he will leave out of his account the most extensive and efficient portion of the facts. On the other hand, one who contemplates nature through the medium of imagination and feeling, perceives innumerable combinations of subtle emotion, which are entirely out of the other's sight, and does infinitely more to increase the gross amount of human knowledge than the mere logical observer" (Hallam, p. 163). The remark strikingly anticipates Mill's vitalist position of two years later: "The greater the individual's capability of happiness and misery, the stronger interest has that individual in arriving at truth; and when once that interest is felt, an impassioned nature is sure to pursue this, as to pursue any other object with greater ardour; for energy of character is commonly the offspring of strong feeling.""9 Imagination and feeling, in Hallam's terms, are the medium, or vehicle, of contemplation. In its turn, contemplation is something quite separate from the "conceptive faculty," as Hallam makes clear when he turns to describe two classes of mental states, the one founded on susceptibility to pleasure and pain, the other on "conceptions of what has previously existed either for the senses, or the emotions" (Hallam's emphasis). Both states are useful, but Epicurus's strength was to perceive with unusual clarity the superiority of the first in its ability to direct "those states of mind which immediately precede action." Pleasure, desire, volition, spontaneity of act are inextricably linked in the Epicurean system. "Throughout the whole range of consciousness he could find no instance in which a conceptive state, a mere thought, stood in the same close relation to any voluntary process, which is occupied by the various conditions of feeling" (Hallam, p. 165). Sentiment, not thought, was the driving wheel of morality; "thoughts were but the ligatures that held together the delicate materials of emotion" (Hallam, p. 167). "A mere thought"-the phrase is reminiscent of Coleridge's "notions," but also his "fixities and definites," the readymade counters of the Fancy. Like Fox before him, Hallam recognizes the place of thought in poetry. He goes on to specify that Epicurus mistakenly leaped from the assertion that "pleasure is a constituent part of every desire" to the belief that pleasure was the only object of desire. Epicurean hedonism is the confusion of those pleasures and pains dependent on moral desire 19/John Stuart Mill, "The Two Kinds of Poetry," in Literary Essays, ed. Edward Alexander (Indianapolis, 1967), p. 77; all further quotations from Mill are from this text.</page><page sequence="13">174 Modern Philology (November 1986) with others resulting from extrinsic circumstances. Though poetry is potentially a seductive enchantress, her function is not merely to communicate spontaneous feeling but, rather, to wed it to the conceptive state: We are apt to be misled by the common use of language, which sets reason or reflection in one scale, and impulse or feeling in the other, and appropriates a right course of conduct to the former alone. The fact is ... that reflection has no more immediate influence on action in the one case than in the other. But here lies the difference: reflections may bring up conceptions of many feelings, good, bad, and indifferent, so that the mind may choose; but those who act from the impulse of one predominant passion without allowing the intervention of any conceptive state, debar themselves from their power of election, and voluntarily act as slaves. [Hallam, p. 169] Thus Hallam's famous distinction in the Tennyson review between poetry of reflection and poetry of sensation extends into the domain of poetic theory his prior distinction between oratory and poetry. "Whenever the mind of the artist suffers itself to be occupied, during its periods of creation, by any other predominant motive than the desire of beauty, the result is false in art" (Hallam, p. 184). The weaknesses of Wordsworth correspond to those of Cicero, to the extent that in many of Wordsworth's poems the intellectual scaffolding again is altogether too visible; the pleasure in knowing something is true is mistaken for the pleasure in knowing that it is beautiful, and hence thoughts are assembled "in a rhetorical battery, that they may convince," instead of flowing "in a natural course of contemplation, that they may enrapture." At the same time, Hallam is willing to concede that Wordsworth's "very distortion of [poetic] truth did more . .. to enlarge and liberalize the genius of our age, than could have been effected by a less sectarian temper" (Hallam, p. 185). What he means here is at least partly defined later on when he speaks of those writers "whose genius, though great, is not strictly and essentially poetic" and who thus "become mediators between the votaries of art and the careless cravers of excite- ment" (Hallam, pp. 190-91). Still, whereas reflective poetry introduces motives extraneous to the desire for beauty and consciously searches after images, the poetry of sensation lives in images, is art free and unalloyed. Hallam here expands his idea of contemplation; the "conceptive" state of mind is restated as a purely intellectual contemplation, while the imaginative "life of immediate sympathy with the external universe," a higher form of contemplation, is also conducive to a higher morality to the very extent that it is spontaneous and unreflecting. And he invokes Wordsworth to clarify his argument: For where beauty is constantly passing before "that inward eye, which is the bliss of solitude"; where the soul seeks it as a perpetual and necessary refreshment to the sources of activity and intuition; where all the other sacred ideas of our nature, the idea of good, the idea of perfection, the idea of truth, are habitually contemplated through the medium of this predominant mood, so that they assume its colour, and are subject to its peculiar laws, there is little danger that the ruling passion of the whole mind will cease to direct its creative operations, or the energetic principle of love for the beautiful sink, even for a brief period, to the level of a mere notion in the understanding. [Hallam, p. 186] A "mere notion," a mere thought, is itself incapable of serving as a guardian of moral truth; emotion, rather, is a kind of vivifying fluid in which truth retains its vitality. At the end of his essay on Cicero, Hallam had commented that the Roman orator's ethics, though salutary, wanted vitality because they were "pervaded with no</page><page sequence="14">Poston/ Coleridge and the Victorians 175 principle of permanent enthusiasm, sufficient at once to sanction the moral law, and to supply the strongest of human motives to its fulfilment. Nothing but positive religion can properly furnish this principle" (Hallam, p. 179). In his review of Tennyson, Hallam accomplishes a Coleridgean transposition of this assertion to the realm of poetic theory: as ethics must be infused with religion, so must truth be invigorated by a predominant mood of sympathy with the external world. It is for this reason that later in the essay Hallam pays tribute to Tennyson's "vivid, picturesque delineation of objects, and the peculiar skill with which he holds all of them fused, to borrow a metaphor from science, in a medium of strong emotion." The comment is anticipated in a revealing letter Hallam wrote to William Bodham Donne on February 13, 1831, some months before approaching Moxon about writing for The Englishman's Magazine. In this letter Hallam comments on "Mariana in the South" and its focus on outward circumstance rather more than on a "palpable transition of the poet into Mariana's feelings." He continues: Were this not implied in the subject, it would be a fault: "an artist," as Alfred is wont to say, "ought to be lord of the five senses," but if he lacks the inward sense which reveals to him what is inward in the heart, he has left out the part of Hamlet in the play. In this meaning I think the objection sometimes made to a poem, that it is too picturesque, is a just objection: but, according to a more strict use of words, poetry cannot be too pictorial, for it cannot represent too truly, and when the object of the poetic power happens to be an object of sensuous perception it is the business of the poetic language to paint. It is observable in the mighty models of art [from Greek and occasionally Roman times] . . . that their way of imaging a mood of the human heart in a group of circumstances, each of which reciprocally affects &amp; is affected by the unity of that mood, resembles much Alfred's manner of delineation, and should therefore give additional sanction to the confidence of our praise. [Kolb, p. 401] As Hallam had earlier conceded the dangers of unchecked spontaneity, so in the review of Tennyson he recognizes the danger of lingering "with fond attachment in the vicinity of sense." Poets of sensation, with their magical powers, have both "the heights and depths of art" within their reach. But "magic," or--as the essay on Cicero terms it--"sorcery," may at least keep us in that contemplative spirit which is a preface to the exertions of philosophy. Hallam's real concern, once more, is with "the allurements of accidental suggestion," which may be "contiguous" in their turn to "the gross and evident passions of our nature," allurements which in the Tennyson review are decried as "every indulgence of heterogeneous aspirations, however pure they may be, however lofty, however suitable to human nature." These morally freighted terms are transposed from their more predictable occurrence in the moral sphere to the context of aesthetic fitness, while a Coleridgean antipathy to "hetero- geneity" hangs over all. For Hallam, more serious and troubling questions are raised by the nature of the age itself, which in the Cicero essay he described as an era of reaction against "ancient creeds and settled habits of assent," a reaction which was "the consequence of long prevalent immorality and a general indifference to religion." The danger inherent in this reaction is that of self-deception and the deception of others, the pursuit of illusory excitements, an intolerance of labor, "when the imagination craves a constant stimulus with a morbid appetite, sometimes leading to delirium; when the prurient desire for novelties, arranged in system, is mistaken for the love of truth" (Hallam, p. 180). In the review of Tennyson Hallam compares the loss of youthful vigor consequent upon the end of Elizabethan literature with the "painful struggle" of his own age to "bring our over-civilised condition of thought</page><page sequence="15">176 Modern Philology (November 1986) into union with the fresh productive spirit that brightened the morning of our literature" (Hallam, p. 190). But repentance, Hallam points out, is unlike innocence. Sensation, reflection, and passion, which once functioned in a unified way, have now become disjoined, and each claims a disproportionate freedom of operation. It is not Yeats, surely, but Matthew Arnold who is foreshadowed in Hallam's lament: "Hence the melancholy which so evidently characterises the spirit of modern poetry; hence that return of the mind upon itself and the habit of seeking relief in idiosyncrasies rather than community of interest" (Hallam, p. 190). A partial solution for Hallam lay in the concept of the sympathetic imagination which he derived from Hartley, Wordsworth, and Shelley, which he first developed in the essay "On Sympathy" read to the Apostles on December 4, 1830, and which in the essay on Cicero emerges as a theme during a discussion of friendship. Cicero conceived of friendship without any thought of the "resemblance of that solemn idea which alone solves the enigma of our feelings, and, while it supplies a meaning to conscience, explains the destination of man." Friendship, and thus love, are defined by Hallam as "the desire which one sentient being feels for another's gratification, and consequent aversion to another's pain" (Hallam, p. 157). The poetic equivalent of such a moral state is that act of sympathetic imagination by which Tennyson "embod[ies] himself in ideal characters, or rather moods of character, with such extreme accuracy of adjustment, that the circumstances of the narration seem to have a natural correspondence with the predominant feeling, and, as it were, to be evolved from it by assimilative force" (Hallam, pp. 191-92). Although Hallam is here praising the same quality in Tennyson which Fox remarked, he does not attribute it to a larger climate shaped by the "new science of mind" which makes possible new imaginative renderings of experience but, rather, to something strongly resembling traditional Christian charity. Where Fox had felt an unease that Tennyson's impersonative faculties might lead him into mere poetical harlequinism, Hallam, devoid of utili- tarian presuppositions, sets aside the question implied by Fox, that of the poet's role in society, to account for Tennyson's achievement in formal terms: a new and permanent contribution to the poetry of sensation which is the "graft of the lyric on the dramatic" (Hallam, p. 197). Indeed, to the extent that the present climate militates against the powers of the mind, Hallam is distrustful of those like Fox who enthusiastically predict a new poetry on new themes: We have indeed seen it urged in some of our fashionable publications, that the diffusion of poetry must be in the direct ratio of the diffusion of machinery, because a highly civilized people must have new objects of interest, and thus a new field will be open to description. But this notable argument forgets that against this objective amelioration may be set the decrease of subjective power, arising from a prevalence of social activity, and a continual absorption of the higher feelings into the palpable interests of ordinary life. The French Revolution may be a finer theme than the war of Troy; but it does not evidently follow that Homer is to find his superior. [Hallam, p. 190]20 20/ Writing to Emily Tennyson on January 25, 1833, Hallam called Fox's review of Tennyson's 1832 volume, published in the Monthly Repository, "an important article .. very fair," though his marginalia, pre- served at the Tennyson Research Centre, suggest a number of disagreements (Kolb, pp. 718-19 and n. 8). The same letter praises Mill's "good essay" at the end of the same issue, but it seems that Hallam identified neither author.</page><page sequence="16">Poston/ Coleridge and the Victorians 177 The five virtues which Hallam sees in Tennyson's poetry are at one and the same time a summary of his Coleridgeanism.21 Tennyson's luxuriance of imagination, coupled with a rigorous control of it; his dramatic power; his delineation of objects and their fusion in "a medium of strong emotion"; his lyricism; but above all, his "elevated habits of thought . .. imparting a mellow soberness of tone, more impres- sive ... than if the author had drawn up a set of opinions in verse, and sought to instruct the understanding rather than to communicate his love of beauty to the heart"-all these features of Tennyson's poetry, in Hallam's opinion, equip him to carry out Coleridge's interrupted program for poetry, with its effort to reconcile the general with the concrete, the idea with the image. Tennyson's poetry is free from the merely notional, free not from meaning but from the heterogeneous taint of abstract meaning. III In his Autobiography, Mill assigns his first contact with the Coleridgeans to the period 1828-29, in the London Debating Society. Although he could not be expected to sympathize with them on all fronts and indeed laments the loss of Maurice as a potential recruit to the party of progress, the confrontation nevertheless helped to force a reevaluation of his early Benthamism. Furthermore, in the evolution of Mill's poetic theory, Tennyson, as for Fox and Hallam, becomes an important test case, a stimulus to his rethinking critical problems as well as a symbol of the new poetry to which an age already roundly condemned for its poetrylessness might aspire. In the two essays published in the Monthly Repository in 1833, Mill declares that poetry of a higher order than the ballad-the most elementary poetic form, associated with a childlike taste for story-derives its interest from the representation of feeling, the state of mind of the person doing the contemplating: thus-he wrote in "What Is Poetry?"-poetry appeals to "minds and hearts of greatest depth and elevation" (Mill, p. 52). Both the emphasis on mental states and the distinction between poetry and narrative are strongly reminiscent of Fox. Although Mill's view in these early essays is expressivist in the sense that the object of a poem is "seen through the medium and arrayed in the colours of the imagination set in action through the feelings," the feelings must be informed by "assiduous intellectual culture" (Mill, p. 66). Mill holds that in its extreme form, nascitur poeta is a false proposition but nonetheless believes that there are poetical natures, mental and physical tempera- ments especially suited to the creation of poetry, and there is in fact little to distinguish his doctrine from that which is enunciated in chapter 15 of the Biographia Literaria: "The man that hath not music in his soul" can indeed never be a genuine poet. Imagery (even taken from nature, much more when transplanted from books, as travels, voyages, and works of natural history); affecting incidents; just thoughts; interesting personal or domestic feelings; and with these the art of their combination or intertexture in the form of a poem; may all by incessant effort be acquired as a trade, by a man of talents and much reading, who, as I once before observed, has mistaken an intense desire of poetic reputation for a natural poetic genius; 21/I am indebted to Johnston, pp. 6-8, for this point.</page><page sequence="17">178 Modern Philology (November 1986) the love of the arbitrary end for a possession of the peculiar means. But the sense of musical delight, with the power of producing it, is a gift of imagination; and this together with the power of reducing multitude into unity of effect, and modifying a series of thoughts by some one predominant thought or feeling, may be cultivated and improved, but can never be learnt. It is in these that "poeta nascitur non fit." [BL, 2:20] Although Mill's theory that poetry is "the thoughts and words in which emotion spontaneously embodies itself" seems to be rooted in the 1800 Preface, Wordsworth himself is clearly a poet of culture, for whom poetry is "almost always the mere setting of thought," poetry evoked by a proposition rather than by feeling. Shelley, on the contrary, though he lacked mental discipline, is a poet for whom unity of feeling is the harmonizing principle. "There is poetry, which could not emanate but from a mental and physical constitution peculiar, not in the kind, but in the degree of its susceptibility" (Mill, p. 73). "Ordinary education" and "the ordinary course of life" work to counteract this, and accordingly, says Mill, here anticipating a later theme of his work, there is need for a different kind of education which does not repress the mental faculties but, rather, trains "up to its proper strength the corrective and antagonist power" (Mill, p. 74). The earlier term "intellectual culture" may perhaps be construed more broadly to include the cultivation of the feelings as themselves integral to the effective operations of the intellect. There is an unmistakably autobiographical note here: the young Mill regretting, as the older man was to do in his Autobiography, the education which had stunted his emotional growth. The gratitude later expressed to Wordsworth, the poet of unpoetic natures who alone could have led him to recognize the role of feeling at that stage of his life, may be genuine as a personal gesture but is surely somewhat equivocal as a literary tribute; it recalls, indeed, Hallam's attribution to Wordsworth of the role of mediator "between the votaries of art and the careless cravers of excitement," one "whose genius, though great, is not strictly and essentially poetic." The essay on "Two Kinds of Poetry," in which Mill, like Hallam, turns the scale in Shelley's favor, does not, however, reflect a permanent shift in Mill's literary opinions but is linked rather to his educational theory, his desire for an education which stimulates a power of susceptibility as a counterbalance to the intellectual powers. It thus foreshadows the position later taken in On Liberty, in which Mill sees the potential for good produced by a person of vigorous impulses as far greater than that which can emanate from "an indolent and passive" nature. Strong feeling may disturb the judgment, Mill writes in "Two Kinds of Poetry," but it also cultivates the ground on which strong impulses toward truth may flourish; the greater the capability of an individual for happiness and misery, the stronger his interest and desire in arriving at truth. No doubt the philosopher-poet with genuine endowments is better than the "mere poet," but as long as education consists merely of the inculcation of orthodox views, then it will not necessarily be the case that the poet of "acquired ideas" is the superior of the poet instructed solely by feelings. Thus for Mill as for Hallam, Wordsworth's poetry seems all too often to conform more to the category of eloquence (Hallam's "rhetoric"), with its consciousness of a hearer, its starting point in a proposition, its harmonizing principle in a central idea rather than unity of feeling. Mill, in short, develops much the same distinction as that which Hallam offers between reflective poetry and the poetry of sensation.</page><page sequence="18">Poston/ Coleridge and the Victorians 179 The importance of Mill's review of Tennyson a year and a half later in the London and Westminster Review, quite apart from its shrewd observations on the poet himself, lies in the half-conscious recognition that the influence of a Shelley, too, required correction. Mill's evolution reflects a larger movement of mind, a tempering of early Victorian Romanticism, which stresses the need to blend nature and culture, so that "the achievement of any poet in his art will be in proportion to the growth and perfection of his thinking faculty." Every great poet has been a great thinker, but Shelley's best poems are not likely to evoke the sympathy of those whose constitution differs from his and are hardly conducive to "the noblest end of poetry as an intellectual pursuit." For Mill, Tennyson has come to symbolize the hope that the poet of nature and the poet of culture may be fused. Tennyson has the temperament of the first and the intellectual culture (or at least the potential for acquiring it) of the second; in his early poetry, he struggles to shape his "sensuous imagery" to a "spiritual meaning," to bring it "under the command of a central and controlling thought or meaning." For example, Mill praises "The Palace of Art" because, despite its blemishes, it represents Tennyson's aspiration "to render his poems not only vivid representations of spiritual states, but symbolical of spiritual truths" (Mill, p. 106). The phrase "symbolical of spiritual truths" suggests, however, another kind of evolution in Mill's thinking; while he moves away from Shelley, he does not abandon Coleridge. What is also evident in the phrase is an implied acceptance of truths incarnate in fact, as exemplified not only by Coleridge but, more vividly for Mill's generation, by Carlyle. In a review of The French Revolution for the London and Westminster Review of July 1837, Mill was to declare that the materials of poetry lie in realfact, an image of the thing itself in the concrete.... That is, the thing must be presented as it can exist only in the mind of a great poet . . .gifted with the two essential elements of the poetic character--creative imagination, which, from a chaos of scattered hints and confused testi- monies, can summon up the Thing to appear before it as a completed whole: and that depth and breadth of feeling which makes all the images that are called up appear arrayed in whatever, of all that belongs to them, is naturally most affecting and impressive to the human soul. [Mill, p. 139] The change in the reputations of Wordsworth and Coleridge over the last thirty years, Mill continues, thus reflects "one of the most conspicuous new elements which have sprung up in the European mind during those years: an insatiable demand for realities, come of conventionalities and formalities what may." The Tennyson review is perhaps most striking, then, for its evidence of Mill's advance in symbolic thinking. Those features of Tennyson's work which Mill praises in particular restate some of Hallam's major ideas. Hallam's tribute to Tennyson's ability to delineate and fuse objects in "a medium of strong emotion" is described by Mill as the power of creating scenery "in keeping with some state of human feeling: so fitted as to be the embodied symbol of it." Tennyson's "graft of the lyric upon the dramatic," his ability in "Recollections of the Arabian Nights" to muster all "in perfect keeping," the absence of rhetorical waste motion in his poetry, as Hallam saw these characteristics, become in Mill's words the "power of making a few touches do the whole work"-an observation which involves comparing "The Lady of Shalott"</page><page sequence="19">180 Modern Philology (November 1986) to The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Christabel. Hallam had also commented that the "female characters" of Tennyson (i.e., those poems, like "Adeline," bearing female names) were "brief and coherent; nothing extraneous to the dominant fact is admitted, nothing illustrative of it, and, as it were, growing out of it, is rejected" (Hallam, p. 197). Whatever Mill's possible indebtedness to Coleridge-and in literary history the course of true indebtedness never runs smooth nor lends itself easily to mapping-he was to go well beyond the position staked out in the Tennyson review, with its praise of the way in which the poet could make "a few touches do the whole work." The essay which effectively concludes his career as an active critic of poetry, "Writings of Alfred de Vigny," published in the London and Westminster Review in 1838, contains his most explicit remarks on the nature of poetic form. In discussing a passage in de Vigny's Stello in which Stello recognizes himself as a poet-responsive to nature, pitying of mankind, infused with a sense of inner power-Mill describes this as "the instinctive insight of a sensitive nature, which from its finer texture vibrates to impressions so evanescent as to be unfelt by others." And he brings to his aid the "beautiful lines of Shelley-himself the most perfect type of that which he described": High, spirit-winged Heart! who dost for ever Beat thine unfeeling bars with vain endeavour, Till those bright plumes of thought, in which arrayed It over-soared this low and worldly shade, Lie shattered; and thy panting, wounded breast Stains with dear blood its unmaternal nest! I weep vain tears: blood would less bitter be, Yet poured forth gladlier, could it profit thee. ["Epipsychidion," lines 13-20] The allusion, however, seems to be the occasion of a graceful farewell to Shelley, for the kind of poetry which Mill goes on to describe is very different from the kind represented by his allusion. "In prose," says Mill, "anything may be said which is worth saying; in verse, only what is worth saying better than prose can say it." The conditions for justifying composition in verse, accordingly, are two: A thought or feeling requires verse for its adequate expression, when in order that it may dart into the soul with the speed of a lightning-flash, the ideas or images that are to convey it require to be pressed closer together than is compatible with the rigid grammatical construction of the prose sentence. One recommendation of verse, therefore, is that it affords a language more condensed than prose. The other is derived from one of the natural laws of the human mind, in the utterance of its thoughts impregnated with its feelings. All emotion which has taken possession of the whole being-which flows unresistedly, and therefore equably-instinctively seeks a language that flows equably like itself; and must either find it, or be conscious of an unsatisfied want, which even impedes and prematurely stops the flow of the feeling. Hence ... all deep and sustained feeling has tended to express itself in rhythmical language; and the deeper the feeling, the more characteristic and decided the rhythm; provided always the feeling be sustained as well as deep; for, afit of passion has no natural connexion with verse or music, a mood of passion has the strongest. . . . This view of the origin of rhythmic utterance in general, and verse in particular, naturally demands short poems, it being impossible that a feeling so intense as to require a more rhythmical cadence than that of eloquent prose, should sustain itself at its highest elevation for long together. [Mill, pp. 183-84]</page><page sequence="20">Poston/Coleridge and the Victorians 181 "Diffuseness" is unpardonable in poetry; for Mill, condensation-for its instan- taneous and telling effect on the reader-and cadence-for the expression of sustained passion-are marks of a truly necessary poetic utterance. Thus, except in earlier ages when the absence of written works made verse necessary as an aid to the memory, "a long poem will always be felt.., .to be something unnatural and hollow." Although this may seem reminiscent of the Carlyle of fragmentary and volcanic utterances, Mill's distinction between "moods" and "fits" and his concept of rhythmic language is well rooted in the preface to Lyrical Ballads and the exchange between Wordsworth and Coleridge on meter. The question-begging use of the terms "short poem" and "long poem," to be sure, reflects a jump from Coleridgean ideas of "fusion" in poetry to quite a different standard of formal judgment and probably also echoes Fox's disdain for the conventional epic. Nonetheless, Mill's attempt to bring language as close as possible into a one-to-one relationship with reality is squarely in the brief tradition we have been describing, a tradition which, as we have seen, drew its adherents from both ends of the utilitarian-Coleridgean axis. IV Two years before Mill's essay on de Vigny and in the same journal, while discoursing respectfully but with an undeniable sense of "something hollow and unnatural" on Philip van Artevelde, William Henry Smith observed: We should tolerate a degree of vagueness, if accompanied by vividness and vehemence, and not deviating from the truth of nature, which [Taylor] would probably be offended with. We apprehend ... that we should admire more cordially than he those strains of poetry in which the meaning is conveyed at a flash, by bold types and fragmentary efforts of the imagination, bearing somewhat the same analogy to the ordinary language of thought, as symbolic writing to the alphabetic character. The precision which we require from the poet is of a different character from that which we demand of the professed logician and philosopher. Instead of labouring to define his idea, to distinguish it with rigid accuracy from every other, he is not merely permitted, but expected, to pour it forth in a state of fusion with many feelings and images which may have no connection with it but in the idiosyncracies of association belonging to a peculiar mind.22 Sometimes, Smith continues, poetic language must be indistinct because it is expressing an indistinct idea. Even Taylor's emphasis on simplicity and clarity represents only a partial truth. This is, one might think, an extraordinarily dangerous theory, appearing to license vagueness, vehemence, and idiosyncrasy of the sort represented by the writers of religious epics in the 1820s and 1830s and their poetic heirs, the Spasmodics. Yet Smith was no friend of such poetry; his midcentury review of Festus was a witty and thoroughly ruthless performance. Rather, he, too, is adverting to the Coleridgean standard which premises an "alphabetic" poetry, and according to which, at least as some early Victorians interpreted it, poetry is not exposition but revelation. What Coleridge and this oddly assorted group of (late) contemporaries and successors had in common was a suspicion of poetry as versified thought, of heterogeneity, of scaffolding, and an ideal in which as nearly as possible the word stands directly for 22/[William Henry Smith], "Philip van Artevelde," Westminster Review 25 (1836): 170.</page><page sequence="21">182 Modern Philology (November 1986) the thing, the image is incarnate in the word, the word coterminous with the image. The incarnative metaphor in Coleridge is fundamentally Christian in its origin and its ending; in Mill it is secular, but it is a metaphor which in either case seeks not so much to exalt sensation over reflection, nature over culture, as to dissolve these distinctions in a poetry of the actual, created rather than constructed. For Coleridge, the power of the Bible lies not in metaphysical propositions but in its historicity, its portrait of events and of a Person in activity. The rising generation of poets extended this effort to embed the visionary in the reassuringly concrete immediacies of a daily world apprehensible to our senses. For this, the criticism of the 1830s gave them ample encouragement. The issue for both Coleridge and Hallam is not to banish thought from poetry but to present thought as inextricably bound up in the image which is at the same time an act. Fox, who refused to dissociate poetry from philosophy, and Hallam, who refused to dissociate either of them from religion, essentially both adhere to the sense of the passage which Fox quoted from "Destiny of Nations," in which "all that meets the bodily sense" is "symbolical, one mighty alphabet." For Fox and Hallam, the poems of Tennyson stimulated a rethinking of traditional generic boundaries; they sought to describe an inner drama constructed "in very narrow space" or "a graft of the lyric upon the dramatic" in which the unifying feeling is that provided by the consciousness of the speaker. And as Coleridge had described the imaginative faculty as the power by which a unifying image or feeling fuses many into one, so Mill pursued the dual concepts of fusion and elision to the level of syntax itself. The ideal of matching language perfectly to thought is impossible of achieve- ment, as Browning's Sordello recognizes when he seeks to embody "perceptions whole" in so pure a work of thought As language: thought may take perception's place But hardly co-exist in any case, Being its mere presentment-of the whole By parts, the simultaneous and the sole By the successive and the many. [2.590-95]23 Nonetheless, the ideal of a poetry beyond the sequentiality of language accounts for the way in which Tennyson and Browning sought their own distinctive escape routes from the philosophic and didactic mode of The Excursion, the austere and measured classicism of Philip van Artevelde, and the bland pastoralism of the early Victorian imitators of Wordsworth, to find a more circumscribed form for the unification of word and image. They were taking yet further the implications both of Coleridge's attempted reconciliation of the general with the concrete, the idea with the image, the representative with the individual, and of Wordsworth's belief, in the "Essay Sup- plementary to the Preface" (1815), that poetry must be a "sensuous incarnation" of "the commerce between Man and his Maker," in "a process where much is rep- 23/The text used is that of the Ohio-Baylor Browning, The Complete Works of Robert Browning, ed.

In The Statesman's Manual, Coleridge had spoken of "the translucence of the Eternal through and in the Temporal" (p. 30). A symbol focuses the light of eternal truth through the particularity of an event, the density of specific things. To reduce the space between the thought and the thing, to "pull the more into the less / Making the finite comprehend / Infinity," as Browning's speaker puts it in Easter-Day (lines 906-8), requires the displacement of discursive language by the event itself. Some- thing of this sort occurs in a sequence of sections in In Memoriam, the long poem which is a sequence of lyric moments. That poetry itself is a theme in the poem has been recognized at least since E. D. H. Johnson's treatment of the subject a quarter of a century ago.27 But more than a crisis of poetic inspiration is at stake; the crisis affects the very roots of language. The speaker disavows his "wild and wandering cries, / Confusions of a wasted youth" not only because they have implied a deficiency in faith but also because they have attempted to contain faith in a now inadequate form. The divestiture of the "coarse weeds" of language, words which "half reveal / And half conceal the Soul within," proceeds apace up to the first Christmas section. The first quarter of the poem seems to say that words will ultimately be displaced by the Word which is not a linguistic sign but the breath of life. In section 18, after Hallam's funeral, the speaker desires to renew what is gone by breathing through the dead man's lips, duplicating Elisha's miracle in an act which transcends language, and in the famous section 95 it is the silent words of Hallam's letters which lead to the experience of a mystical union which passes the power of words to convey. And when in section 23 the speaker remembers an unrecapturable Wordsworthian youth among the "lavish hills" with Hallam, he recalls it in terms of a primitive interaction, not only between man and nature but also between friends, a nonverbal or even preverbal relationship when "Thought leapt out to wed with Thought / 'Ere Thought could wed itself to Speech." The tentative subduing of the speaker's "troubled spirit" brought by the first Christmas opens the way for the retelling of the story of Lazarus in sections 31 and 24/ The Prose Works of William Wordsworth, ed.

The description of "the man raised by Christ," the silent joy of his sister, the silence of Lazarus and the Evangels as to the nature of the experience, are followed by a warning to the modern sophisticate "whose faith has centre everywhere, / Nor cares to fix itself to form." At this point, Tennyson's poetic procedure affirms the sister's intuition. Section 36 seems almost written as if Tennyson had had access to Coleridge's remark in his notebooks that miracles are a "series of events resolved in the Bible in a size and compass proportionate to our faculties."28 For Wisdom dealt with mortal powers, Where truth in closest words shall fail, When truth embodied in a tale Shall enter in at lowly doors. What the speaker later describes as "short swallow-flights of song" make the fact of death not only manageable but somehow intimate; the poetic procedure is clearly conceived as analogous to biblical parable and miracle narrative. Where exposition, the language of logic ("truth in closest words"), fails to explain, dramatic incident illuminates; where sustained elegy falters, the lyric focuses the speaker's discontents, offers a moment of relief, and provides the momentum needed to press ahead. One attraction the sister's childlike innocence has for Tennyson's Victorian audience lies in her resulting ability to perceive nonverbally and nonsequentially. As Coleridge argues in Aids to Reflection: "The great fundamental truths and doctrines of religion, the existence and attributes of God and the life after death, are in Christian countries, taught so early, under such circumstances, and in such close and vital association with whatever makes or marks reality for our infant minds, that the words ever after represent sensations, feelings, vital assurances.. . rather than thoughts, or any distinct conception" (p. 226). Loving simplicity responds to the event without the need for rational explanations. Tennyson apparently had little sympathy for, or even acquaintance with, Coleridge's prose,29 and it is likely that for him as much as for Browning in the 1830s such figures as Maurice, Hallam, Fox, and Mill were, rather, filters through which a Coleridgean concept of poetry was strained. While these critics and friends certainly would not have predicted the course of Tennyson's poetic development, their wrestling with the nature of poetic form and the language of poetry helps to establish a context for understanding the climate in which the rising poetic generation of the 1830s sought its bearings. To reduce the space between the thought and the thing, to exclude the "amphibious something" which would otherwise threaten to rend asunder the self-contained world of the poem, is at the heart of much of that generation's best and most characteristic poetry, even as it defines one significant tendency in modern poetics.
