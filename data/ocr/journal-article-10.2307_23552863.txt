The Music In keeping with Johnson's manifesto of grandeur and dignity, Myers uses his own musical language. Only once (in "Let My People Go") does he quote melody from the heritage of the spiritual, although he never loses sight of the elements of rhyth mic vitality, dynamic variety, and choral sonority so firmly established today as the spiritual's aural images. Figure 1 illustrates one of the numerous passages that evokes the spirit if not the music of this heritage. PAGE 26 CHORAL JOURNAL</page><page sequence="3">Each of Myers's movements is devoted to the text of a single sermon and follows the sequence of Johnson's text, occasion ally repeating words as a means of extend ing an emotional and textual experience (as at the end of the first movement where the chorus exults in the anticipation of "that great gittin' up morning").12 While there is a strong sense of stylistic unity and a clear pattern to the scoring (a rota tion through the first six movements of chorus unaccompanied, full instrumen tation, and accompaniment by only three trombones), each movement is musically independent and free of any connection to the music of the other movements.13 Although the work is less organic textu ally and musically than the familiar canon of oratorios and cantatas, it allows each movement to be programmed separately (for a concert or service of worship), each with a duration and structural integrity that allows it to be substantial and meaningful. Johnson's Preface to God's Trombones is significant for understanding the poetry and Myers's musical shaping of it. Writ ing about his interest in evoking the spirit of "the old-time Negro preacher, " Johnson relished the idea that the preacher was above all an orator, and in good measure an actor, and that the secret of oratory was fundamentally "a progression of rhythmic words more than . . . anything else."14 Accordingly, Myers's music for his principal soloist—to whom the bulk of the text of the sermons is given—is styled more as arioso than as song, more as rich declamation and musical exhortation than self-contained tunefulness. The narration of the third day of Cre ation is typical of Myers's writing for the solo voice and the overall style of the piece: an easy flow of word and melodic line, a duet texture (often canonic), and a simplicity that is at one with the direct ness and seeming artlessness of Johnson's poetry (Figure 2).

A great deal of the choral work is given to echoing the preacher's narrations and exhortations or to lyric and sonorous punctuation of them; the result is a sense of a congregation caught up in the fervor of its spiritual leader and responding to it (Figure 6). Myers is especially sensitive to the ef fectiveness of duet textures, since the ele ment of polyphony provides not only inherent musical interest but also the "mm t 1 r day when God's a - going to rain down fire?

The soloist is frequently paired with an independently melodic trombone, for example, and the choral contrast of male and female timbres is exploited in every movement. In the sixth movement, Myers uses a unison chorus as a narrative decla mation against a tender duet for two trom bones in an unusual and deft variant of this approach. The empty octaves between men and women lend impact to the congregation's grief at Jesus' torment (Fig ure 7). Elsewhere, the music can be folk like and buoyant (Figure 8).17 Harmonically conservative, the music is pervasively diatonic and tonal, although, to lend spice to the musical illumination of the text, augmented triads, harmoniza tion at the major second, and chromati cism are effectively applied (Figure 4). In "The Crucifixion," we are given a chord that sets a second soprano Ef against a tenor E^ and a first soprano G against an alto A to illuminate the splitting of the veil of the Temple. In "Go Down, Death," the tritone of C and Fit forms an arche type18 for the chords, harmonizing the setting of the words "On Death rode," and a few measures later, we are given the depiction of "leaving the lightnings flash behind" via unison octave skips sparked by an incisive minor second at the har monization of "flash." In "The Prodigal Son" we have a pas sage (Figure 9) that not only illustrates Myers's subtle and piquant use of disso nance but also represents his setting of male against female timbres. The device PAGE 28 CHORAL JOURNAL</page><page sequence="5">of the climactic crescendo ending on a clash of pitches and Myers's sense of the flow and ethnic richness of Johnsons po etry present a deliciously ironic parroting of the wastrel's search for an easy life and the warning by the congregation against it. Individual Movements I. "Listen Lord—A Prayer" The opening prayer is unaccompanied and moves from the intense softness of the choir's invocation (Figure 3) to a more vigorous pleading by the preacher and congregation for God's mercy. As Johnson's poetic message becomes a vivid entreaty, the choral writing turns to a tumble of sonorities, rhythms, and quickly changing harmonies; each phrase of text being illuminated by musical pictorialization (such as repeated chords suggest "beating on the iron heart of sin," and the sudden triplets and contrasting rhythms of men's and women's voices pro pel the image of the plea that God "put perpetual motion in his arms"). The mood shifts from intense to hu mility and wretchedness. The preacher admits his own imperfection and makes a personal plea to "Mary's baby" for sup port when he faces his final moments of life. With appropriate descents for "the steep and slippery steps of death," the chorus (especially tenors and basses) be comes a hushed accompaniment to the personal, first-person text (Figure 10). Choral scoring of the coda of this movement, an excited choral and solo anticipation of "that great gittin' up morning," offers quick changes from unisons to six-part major chords. In the last moments a return to the incantatory spirit of the first measures in a series of diminishing amens, arrive at a hushed C major through a gentle modal sequence. II. "The Creation" Prior to the description of the creation of "a living soul," this movement has been episodic, dominated by a quasi-recitative style given to the baritone. Strong disso nances for the brass quintet at the begin ning of the movement provide a sense of the epic and majestic to an otherwise declamatory movement. It says: God is personalized. Even after creating all the marvels of nature, He is lonely. He sits on the side of a hill think- III.

The jaunty trombone fig ure accompanies the baritone's taking up of the tale, much like a good-for-nothing companion leading his friend down "the smooth and easy road" until the entry into Babylon, whereupon a new tune takes over as the primary refrain of the movement's cheerful description of the attractions of the city of sin. The high spirits of the music prevail until a more serious mood is evoked by the call to repentance near the movement's final measures.

Pausing only for the words by Noah to his contemporaries (Figure 16), the narrative and music then move to the sudden arrival of teeming rains, told cho rally in a quick-moving chordal style (Fig ure 17). Noahs warning returns in the cantatas final movement as a call to re pentance. The mockery of the crowd is portrayed in the music and text. A brief march for the entry of the chosen into the Ark fol lows. When the rains come, the music manifests a rapid homophony of an un accompanied chorus, depicting the on rush of the torrents of rain and the panicked cries of those left to drown. Women's and men's voices alternate, then combine, their final phrases evoking the heritage of the spiritual. The loneliness of the ark on the sea is set as an arioso for baritone framed against held chords in the brass. A lyric element enters the foreground as the waters recede and Noah, with tears of joy, gives thanks. The final moments are for chorus and brass in full cry for God's warning, "Next time I'll rain down fire." VI. "The Crucifixion" A hushed ostinato for two trombones in thirds provides a stark, spiritually ex hausted opening for this personal and dra matic remembrance of Christianity's central episode. Johnson's poetry and Myers's music are the expressions of ob servers, not historians, and the connec tion of the preacher and his congregation with Jesus is continuous and immediate. "My gentle Jesus," "my burdened Jesus," and "my sorrowing Jesus" are given to halting, repeated-note phrases, lacking in melodic inflection and harmonically bare, bespeaking a grief that cannot be assuaged by melodiousness; the pliant arioso of Jesus' sayings are, therefore, all the more poignant and moving. Direct involvement of the choir with the narrative makes the choral expression of anger at Judas' be trayal violent by contrast: the sudden four part writing and chromatic slide are particularly striking; the alteration of the ostinato powerfully ironic and effec tive.

The appearance of the spiritual's music in the choral commen tary provides a musical coherence to the sequence of narrated events. VIII. "The Judgment Day" Powerful fanfares from the brass quin tet lead into a second set of fanfares for chorus and soloist as the text turns to the day when "God's a-going to rain down fire" and "a-going to call for Gabriel." The music is vivid, with short phrases, sudden crescendi and a mood of unre strained excitement until the chorus be gins to describe the terrible events of that final time. A choral unison leads to a remarkable evocation—through rhythm and brass/choral sonority (Figure 18)— of the rising of the dry bones of the dead; the mood becomes increasingly frantic, collapsing into the return of the Noah movement's mournful accents of a call to sinners to repent (Figure 16). Gracious flowing moments, indicative of the life of the eternally saved, alternate with harsh unisons that call up images of the emptiness and suffering of "liars and backsliders" who will be sent "Down into the bottomless pit" (with, of course, ap propriate plummeting into the nether reaches of pitch). The final passages of the poem address the awesome nature of God, who will "start the wheels of eternity" (quietly re peated phrases marked by triplets). There is one more appeal to sinners to repent (Figure 16 returns once again), but these plaintive sounds dissolve into the cantata's conclusion with brilliant fanfares and a thrilling fortissimo cadence in C major, as chorus and brass sing with excitement and fear of "that great day when God's a going to rain down fire."
