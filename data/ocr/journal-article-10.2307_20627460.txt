The Chalcolithic cemeteries of the Souskiou area, located about 2 km inland from Kouklia Palaipaphos in the Dhiarizos River valley of southwestern Cyprus, have long been renowned for their unusual bell- or bottle-shaped shaft tombs with mul tiple burials and the impressive array of picrolite cruciform figurines and pendants, ornaments of shell, faience, and copper, and representational pottery vessels brought to light by looters and legitimate rescue excavations. The Souskiou mortuary complex contrasts distinctively with burial prac tices observed at other extensively investigated Chalcolithic sites in western Cyprus such as Lemba Lakkous and Kisso nerga Mosphilia, where comparatively modest pit tombs with single or small numbers of interments were usually found interspersed with habitation areas (EJ. Peltenburg et al., Lemba Archaeological Project 1: Excavations at Lemba Lakkous, 1916-1983. SIMA 70 [ 1 ] [G?teborg 1985]; Lemba Archaeologi cal Project 2( 1): Excavations atKissonerga-Mosphilia, 1979-1992. SIMA70[2] [Partille 1998]). In the volume reviewed here, Peltenburg, Christou, and colleagues bring together the results of four archaeological missions undertaken since 1950 at Souskiou Vathyrkakas cem etery 1 (hereafter SV 1). SV 1 is one of three known mortu ary precincts at Vathyrkakas. It is separated by a deep ravine from another recently excavated, contemporary cemetery at Souskiou Laona (L. Crewe et al., RDAC [2005] 41-67) and from a settlement site of the same name, where archaeological excavations are ongoing (E.J. Peltenburg et al., RDAC [2006] 77-105). SV1 is dated on the basis of ceramics to the Middle Chalcolithic period (ca. 3200-2900 B.C.E.). In the introduction and chapters 1-3, Peltenburg and Christou detail the history of excavations at SV 1 by the British Kouklia Mission in 1950 and 1951, the German Archaeologi cal Expedition in 1972, and the Department of Antiquities of Cyprus in 1972 and 1991 through 1997. The excavations of the 1990s, undertaken in collaboration with Peltenburg and students from the universities of Edinburgh and Ath ens, were conducted as research as well as rescue operations and involved a more extensive use of sieving than previous investigations. The reader will occasionally be baffled by the different counts of features cited by Christou and Peltenburg in their respective accounts and in the catalogue (ch. 2); part of this problem is that a dozen or more features were ap parently excavated repeatedly by different projects and have consequently been numbered twice. Clarification is to be found in the synoptic chapter 12, where Peltenburg tabulates 82 Middle Chalcolithic features, of which 31 were intact or partially looted tombs with undisturbed burial deposits. Ap proximately half of the 82 features were either straight-sided or bell-shaped shaft tombs cut down from ovoid surface pits, with overall depths of 1.7-3.0 m. Larger (up to 4.0 m deep), more elaborate square-pit-and-shaft tombs accounted for 11 % of the sample, and another 16% of the features were small, shallow, oval pits of indeterminate function. The shaft tombs were sealed with capstones set in the surface pits and were sometimes mounded over with cairns of smaller stones that would have formed visible, above-ground markers seldom preserved in other Cypriot burial contexts. In chapter 4, an analysis of the human dentition by Lunt and Watts is followed by a separate discussion of the other skeletal remains by Parras. Due to the host of taphonomic issues that typically afflict burials in Cyprus?repeated epi sodes of tomb use and ritual processing, recurrent flooding, a highly alkaline soil environment, the depredations of loot ing, and the limitations of past excavation and conservation practices?all the bones and teeth recovered were poorly preserved. Even so, the analysts have successfully elicited much valuable demographic and ritual data from the extant sample, estimated to comprise a minimum of 187 individuals from roughly 50 tombs. Mean or modal numbers of burials per tomb have not been calculated, but the range of buri als per tomb appears to have been 1-14 individuals. Of the adults that could be sexed, 24 are identified as female and 18 as male (one assumes primarily on the basis of cranial traits; cf. 56). Although not a single child's bone could be clearly iden tified among the crumbling skeletal remains, the dental sample attests to the presence of numerous children in some tombs (most notably the square-pit-and-shaft tombs). Lunt and Watts identify roughly one-third of the overall sample as juveniles. Since this category includes a substantial number of individuals from the 17-25-year-old and young adult age brackets, however, and given the probable disparity between definitions of modern biological adulthood and prehistoric social adulthood, the proportion of children may actually have been closer to one-fifth or one-quarter of the sample. This is lower than the 50% expected in most preindustrial societies (G. Acs?di and J. Nemeskeri, History of Human Life Span and Mortality [Budapest 1970]) and considerably less than the 71-72% fraction of juveniles observed in the Chal colithic mortuary populations of Lemba Lakkous and Kis sonerga Mosphilia. The Souskiou juvenile figures strongly suggest that many deceased infants and children were dis posed of in other locations, perhaps to be found by current or future excavations in the Laona settlement area. Based on the condition of skeletal remains and field ob servations of their disposition, Parras argues that the burials in each tomb were originally deposited as sequential primary interments (usually flexed, according to Peltenburg [ch. 12]). With the introduction of each successive burial, however, earlier interments appear to have been dismembered and stacked with skulls atop long bones and other body parts in piles arranged near the feet of incoming burials. Parras argues that the presence of hand and foot bones (not quantified), along with teeth, suggests that the process of disarticulation took place within the tomb. However, the distal and proximal epiphyses of the long bones were almost never preserved, perhaps due to the relative fragility of spongy versus cortical bone (but conceivably attesting to some external processing). The single distal tibia observed had signs of a possible cut</page><page sequence="2">358 BOOK REVIEWS [AJA 112 mark, perhaps associated with the severing of tendons. As Peltenburg argues in chapter 12, the dismemberment and regrouping of earlier burials may have symbolized the final incorporation of the deceased into a society of the ances tors. Such a practice both presages and contrasts with other programs of secondary treatment proposed for subsequent Bronze Age communities (P. Keswani, Mortuary Ritual and Society in Bronze Age Cyprus [London 2004]). Chapters 5-11 present specialist studies of representation al figurines and pendants (Goring), other body ornaments (Peltenburg, Shortland, Tite), pottery (including represen tational vessels) (Bolger), ground stone (Jackson), chipped stone (McCartney), molluskan material (Ridout-Sharpe), and animal bone (Croft). These contributions are commendable for their careful analysis of use-wear and the contextual as sociations of the finds under review. Goring and Bolger note that a few of the anthropomorphic figurines and pottery ves sels (generally interpreted as representations of pregnancy, birth, or fertility) appear to have been deliberately damaged before deposition in tomb contexts. Bolger (112) draws a parallel between this practice and the apparent "killing" of ceramic birthing figurines in the much discussed ritual de posit at Kissonerga Mosphilia (EJ. Peltenburg et al., Lemba Archaeological Project 2(2): A Ceremonial Area at Kissonerga. SIMA 70 [3] [G?teborg 1991 ]). Overall, however, many components of mortuary paraphernalia, including picrolite figurines, pendants, and dentalium shell ornaments, show few signs of damage or wear and may have been produced specifically for burial rituals. In contrast to the Early-Middle Bronze Age when large quantities of pottery were disposed of with the dead, only nine tombs at SV 1 contained any Chalcolithic pottery at all, and in the one intact tomb for which quanti fication was possible, only three of the 34 grave goods were ceramic. Animal sacrifices or other offerings of meat were also contrastingly absent. There were, however, some deliber ate faunal inclusions?elements of pig feet, a crab claw, and part of a fox foot?recovered from a few spatially clustered tombs. Croft proposes that these may have been attached to clothing, skins, or shrouds worn by the dead. McCartney's discussion of the chipped stone tool finds is particularly important to the reconstruction of second ary burial treatments advanced by Parras and Peltenburg. Of the 38 artifacts recovered from 14 tombs, 84% were un retouched, utilized flakes with fine angular edge damage. McCartney notes a lack of any patterned association of these objects with particular tomb types, age/sex factors, or other grave goods and proposes that the chipped stone served as "a functional element of the burial ritual rather than a spe cific status marker" (138). A large utilized flake was found beside a skull in Tomb 55; a small one was found on top of a bone stack near a skull in Tomb 73; in other tombs, such flakes were often found in the fill. McCartney notes the preva lence of a light gloss on the flakes, which she interprets to be more consistent with the cutting of plant material than of human flesh, bone, or tendons. Still, it is conceivable that the chipped stone flakes were used to slash burial wrappings or cords binding the bodies. In chapter 12, Peltenburg discusses the social signifi cance of the mortuary practices observed at SV 1. Here he seems to retreat from his earlier hypothesis (Peltenburg et al. 1998) that Souskiou was a regional burial center to which the underrepresented adults of Lemba and Kissonerga were transported, arguing for a local derivation of the Souskiou mortuary population on the basis of ceramic differences with the communities of the far west (163). Nevertheless, Pelten burg and colleagues continue to argue that Souskiou served as an integrative regional center for rituals concerned with birth and death (Crewe et al. 2005), and for the exchange of materials such as picrolite from the Kouris valley to the east (98) and chert from the Dhiarizos valley itself with com munities in the west (Peltenburg et al. 2006). Peltenburg links the development of the Souskiou mor tuary complex to "a shift in ideology from the individual to the corporate that corresponds to the increased importance of houses/households" (181). He argues that this phenom enon is consistent with changing patterns in round-house architecture observed at Middle Chalcolithic settlement sites. Until the chronology of the various cemeteries in the Souskiou area is resolved, the question of whether different burial grounds were associated with different kin or other corporate groups remains a matter for speculation. Within SV 1, however, Peltenburg proposes that different groups asserted their social identity through the use of distinctive types of body ornaments and other material symbols. Stylistic attributes of picrolite pendants are noted to vary between groups, and some groups have idiosyncratic concentrations of shell, pigs tusk, and serpentine beads. (Croft's hypothesis concerning the use of pelts or hides in certain tombs may be relevant here.) The occurrence of higher concentrations of juvenile buri als in the most elaborate square-pit-and-shaft tomb types may reflect a "greater emphasis on descent and inter-gen erational continuity" in some groups (163). Whether this reflects a concurrent development of status differentiation or rank between groups within the community is not entirely clear. One of the most notable arrays of grave goods occurs in Tomb 86, a simpler bell-shaped shaft tomb. Quantities of grave goods, moreover, do not appear to correlate with the energy invested in tomb construction; although here, as elsewhere throughout the book, one wishes for the applica tion of formal statistical analyses. The burials in Tomb 73, an unusually large square-pit-and-shaft tomb complex with an upper pit floor area of 19.35 m2, were accompanied by what Peltenburg describes as an "unprepossessing" (176) ar ray of finds that included a number of chipped stone flakes and bone needles. He suggests that these individuals may have been ritual practitioners who sewed burial wrappings for the deceased and dismembered older corpses on suc cessive occasions of burial. It is equally possible, however, that the tools found in this tomb, as in others, were used in the ritual processing of associated burials, rather than be ing personal paraphernalia of the deceased. Whatever social differences developed between groups seem to have been unstable; Tomb 73 was apparently deliberately disturbed at the end of the Middle Chalcolithic, and Late Chalcolithic burial complexes with comparable levels of display have yet to be observed at Soukiou or elsewhere. Despite occasional weaknesses in editorial oversight and statistical presentation, this volume makes a major contri bution to our understanding of cultural developments in Chalcolithic Cyprus. It is, furthermore, one of the most in teresting and important mortuary reports in the history of</page><page sequence="3">2008] BOOK REVIEWS 359 Cypriot archaeology. It demonstrates the wealth of social, demographic, and ideological information that can be ex tracted from badly preserved mortuary remains when stud ies of osteological data and ritual practices are accorded the priority they deserve. As such, it should be of interest to scholars working in many regions of the world, within and beyond the Mediterranean and Near East.
