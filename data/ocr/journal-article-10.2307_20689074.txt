<plain_text><page sequence="1">STEPHEN A. GELLER Were the Prophets Poets? IS THE BIBLE LITERATURE? With the recent revival of interest in the literary study of the Hebrew Bible this question has again become the focus of debate. This essay does no intend to grapple directly with the theoretical and philosophical problems that enliven that debate. It will focus on a narrower issue which is yet an epitome of the wider problem: were the prophets also poets? In answer it will present a small exercise in literary exegesis of a prophetic text. The underlying hope is that the results of the exercise will be relevant to the discussion of the primary literary problem. Were Israel's prophet's also poets? This question resolves itself into two others: can they be poets and, if so, may they be? The former is a question of ability, the latter of propriety. This particular issue is so emblematic of the larger one because there has always been tension between the phenomena of prophecy and poetry. It is inherent even in the etymology of the terms. A prophet is a "(forth) speaker,"' the mouthpiece of a god. A poet is a "maker," a craftsman in words. The former is a medium, the latter an artist. A prophet who consciously molded his prophecy would be false. A poet whose verse did not reflect his personality would be no true artist. The tension was perceptible to the Greeks. To be sure, they ascribed divine inspiration to both prophets and poets. The muse inspired the latter as Apollo did his Pythian oracle. But that prophetess delivered the god's message in a sacred babble. It was an attendent, crafty priest who translated it into poetry, understandable, if enigmatic, to humans. It was this second intermediary who was called a pro phetes, Aaron to the oracle's Moses, so to speak. But who was the real prophet and who only a poet? Later Greeks declared all poets, like Cretans, to be liars. Their PR2OOFTEXTS 3 (1983): 211-221 @ 1983 by The Jonsn Hopkins U niversity Press</page><page sequence="2">212 STEPHEN A. GELLER chief lies were the stories about the gods, the sources of prophecy. Both prophecy and poetry were human fabrications. Israel also felt the tension between prophecy and poetry. It may be perceived in Ezekiel's touchy complaint that the people view him as a mere maker of parables, a singer of love songs (Ezek. 21:5; 33:32). He knows that to be called a poet is an accusation of false prophecy. Lying prophets composed their oracles consciously, millibbam, "from their own hearts." They were akin to poets. Poetry was probably viewed as a branch of Wisdom. To be sure, it was also divinely inspired, but only in a remoter sense. God put wisdom into Solomon's heart but the three thousand proverbs and thousand and five songs he spoke were his, not God's, achievement. A prophet who admitted to being a poet would stand self-condemned by his own mouth. Later Jews, like Greeks, simplified the issue. Tradition absorbed poetry into prophecy. David's Psalms and Solomon's songs were uttered by the same Holy Spirit that spoke through Isaiah's oracles. The Rabbis "forgot" poetry in the Bible.2 Some maintained that "the Torah speaks in human language;" that is, clothes itself in literary forms just as the divine Glory wraps itself in a cloud. Just as that cloud shields weak men from the searing Presence, so the literary garb of the Bible is a fabric of divine grace, to make comprehensible the love of an ineffable God. To view the Bible as literature betrays God's goodness. Aesthetic judgment of a sacred "poem" is inherently blasphemous, because it implies an assessment of the Author's skill. If the poem is declared beautiful it might have been declared ugly; but the divine can only be beautiful. So even if the Bible can be viewed as literature, it may not be. Its poetic aspect, like succulent but forbidden meats, is morally repugnant to the pious. It is not surprising that when, in the eighteenth century, scholarship claimed the Bible for humanity, one of the first things "discovered" was biblical poetry. Yet even its first explorer, Bishop Lowth, despaired of uncovering the secrets of Hebrew meter because of our ignorance of the original pronunciation. For biblical scholarship the issue became one of possibility rather than propriety; not may the Bible be viewed as literature but can it be? Is the text sound enough for literary analysis? Can scholars reconstruct enough of ancient Israel's culture to allow literary communication between the ancient authors and ourselves? These are historical questions; and it was to historical research that biblical scholarship devoted itself for two centuries. Most biblicists (but never the greatest ones) soon forgot the original literary questions that moved people like Lowth and Herder. Thirty years ago some scholars became more receptive to literary analysis, mainly because the historical study of the Bible seemed to have reached an impasse. It is ironic that general literary criticism had by that time</page><page sequence="3">Were the Prophets Poets? 213 become incapable of providing sure guidance to inquiring biblicists. Literary critics were asking if the interpretation of any text is possible, or even advisable. Can we truly understand an author or, indeed, anyone other than ourselves? Others asked if it was proper to view texts through the prism of history. Why respect an author's presumed intentions? Such disorienting questions were disturbing to those whose job it was to interpret an ancient text like the Bible. They felt they had to penetrate beyond their own prejudices into the mental world of a remote antiquity. Historical reconstruction seemed the only scholarly method of approach, even for literary analysis. How could one reconcile the claims of history and literature, science and art? This essay cannot attempt to answer such large questions. As stated, it will limit itself to a small literary exercise in biblical interpretation, trying to determine if a brief prophetic passage can and ought to be considered poetry. Nevertheless, the type of analysis presented rests on a method that tries to be true to both historical and literary study. The essential assumption is that literature must be approached through lan guage, that the goal of literary analysis is, as Schleiermacher said, to reconstruct the linguistic world of the author and his original audience. The following summary of the method is necessarily apodictic. It is a pastiche of the New Criticism, Russian formalism and other linguistically-oriented types of literary criticism. No claim is made that it represents the only proper way to approach texts. However, it has shown itself to be a useful one in dealing with ancient literature. The basic principles are the following: a poet, as a literary artist, may be viewed as a kind of craftsman in words. One may judge his work more or less as one does that of any skilled artisan, by the "success" of his product. For example, a potter is judged by the skill with which he has formed material (clay) to fit certain functions (holding liquids, resisting heat) to produce a satisfying emotional reaction (attraction or repulsion, beauty or ugliness).3 The latter aspect is the nettle. Emotional, aesthetic reaction is so idiosyncratic. One can only state that though a mystery it is still a fact. Man has been judging even tools for aesthetic features like symmetry ever since he first chipped a flint ax into a finer shape than that required for use. That was long before homo became sapiens. Poems are judged by how well the poet has formed his material (words) to fit function (meaning) and affect our emotions. Poets must join words to meaning and feeling in a manner that arouses our awe at their skill. This virtuosity consists of the exploitation of the possibilities of language for establishing many lines of meaning. Linguistic richness is the major formal criterion of poetry. It must not be confused with</page><page sequence="4">214 STEPHEN A. GELLER mere elaboration or ornamentation. Often the "simplest" poems are the most complex linguistically. A formal clue to the link of meaning and emotion is often legitimate ambiguity. By "legitimate" is meant "allowed by language." In the case of ancient texts, for which we have no linguistic or literary "competence," this means historical reconstruction of the act of communication between author and audience. Ambiguities and other "problems" in a text often reveal inner tensions that can point the way to true meaning.4 For illustration I have chosen Isaiah 40:6-8. If it can be viewed as one does poetry, if its author displays a poet's skill in molding language to meaning and emotion, then he can be a poet. Then one may decide if he may be. The text is in relatively good shape and there are no real problems of basic meaning. This is a crucial point. The ambiguities one looks for must not be those engendered by textual corruption or other historical problems. Literary analysis can only plough a field that has been cleared of stumps and stones by historical criticism. This particular field has been ploughed often and well. It is one of the most familiar passages in the Hebrew Bible and is fully treated in innumerable com mentaries. It is therefore a good test of the special contribution that literary analysis can make to the understanding of the Bible. The three biblical verses resolve themselves into four couplets and eight lines:5 -173K ip 1. A voice says, Proclaim! .13 62. And I said, What shall I proclaim?6 -11.rj ~3. All flesh is grass, ri yz inlp y' l 4. And all its loyalty like flowers of the field. ".i 5= -1yn 5. Grass withers, flowers droop 6. When the wind of the Lord blows on them;7 yi.Y 5:13 '1.yr U, 7. Grass withers, flowers droop, Y tup, viri'm -11. 8. But the word of our God lasts forever! All translations deceive; details regarding this one's perfidy will be presented below. First we must record some basic facts about the struc ture and meaning of the passage, paying special notice to ambiguities and problems. These lines form part of a larger speech which begins in 40:1. The famous command "Comfort, comfort my people!" introduces the proph ecy of the so-called Second Isaiah, a prophet who lived during the Babylonian Exile, the imminent end of which he is announcing here. The section that immediately precedes our passage declares the coming divine theophany. God will proceed along a miraculous road through the desert to rescue his people and lead them in a second exodus back to their land. This event will be witnessed by "all flesh," a phrase which is echoed by line three of our passage; just as its initial kol omer kera', "A</page><page sequence="5">Were the Prophets Poets? 215 voice says, Proclaim!" recalls the proclaiming voice of verse 3; and "our God" of line 8 reiterates the same word in that verse. In short, the passage is well nested in its context. Its distinctness from its environment is also clear. The eight lines are linked by form and meaning. The core structure is the quatrain of lines five to eight. Repetition serves to focus attention in the final, climactic word: le'olam, "forever." Repetition of "grass" and "flowers"' also ties lines three and four to the quatrain. Lines one and two serve as an introduction, but also present a major structural ambiguity. They apparently record a dialogue between a (presumably) angelic voice and a (presumably) prophetic respondent. Does that dialogue continue in the following lines? If so, who says what? Are lines three and four the angelic reply to "what shall I proclaim?" or an exclamation of despair by the prophet? Or are lines five through eight perhaps the angel's answer? The meaning of the passage shows a similar tension between clarity and uncertainty. The dominant metaphor of withering vegetation, high lighted by the repetition quatrain, presents the following equations: the loyalty of flesh : grass/flowers the word of our God : lasts forever The essential contrast is established by the pairs flesh: God and (wither ing) grass/flowers: forever. The logic is the opposition between human transitoriness and divine permanence; and also, to the ancient mind, between frailty and strength. Man ("flesh") is weak; like grass he soon shrivels (cf. Job 14:1 ff.); God is powerful and eternal. But here the metaphor of vegetation is modified by hasdo, "its loyalty." This word perhaps saves the image from triteness, but it also poses a serious problem of interpretation.8 If it is specifically the loyalty of all flesh that is weak and impermanent, to what did it prove disloyal? To the word of God, to which it corresponds in the above equations? If so, what is meant by "word?" Hebrew davar also means "deed;" were man's words or deeds treasonous and/or weak? The clarity of the metaphor itself begins to wither. The structure of the dominant quatrain, by the very power of its form, highlights another major ambiguity. Lines six and eight are placed in parallel positions. One is thus forced to consider the relationship between the two corresponding phrases ruah adonai and devar eloheinu, "wind of the Lord" and "word of our God," respectively. The force of the quatrain and the logic of the metaphor demand a contrast between them, but every Israelite would recognize them as complementary terms. Ruah's other sense is "spirit." When joined, as here, to davar, "word," the pair is almost diagnostic of the phenomenon of prophecy. The prophet, filled by the "spirit" delivers God's "word." The prophetic context of the passage seems to confirm this impression. Yet the metaphor requires that</page><page sequence="6">216 STEPHEN A. GELLER ruah have its other, meteorological sense: the searing sirocco that blasts vegetation. Ruah adonai may even mean simply "mighty wind," a well known demotion of the deity, so to speak, to a grammatical superlative in biblical Hebrew.9 "Wind of the Lord" may also have an anthropomor phic sense: the blast of God's wrath that incinerates his foes, an image familiar to Bible readers (cf. Psalm 18:16, etc.). The point of the metaphor would then be punishment. Retribution, transience, prophetic inspiration: ruah adonai, like the arrow of a disoriented compass, swings in several directions. But if it is to mean punishment, who is being blasted, and for what crime? Are "wind" and "spirit" simply a clever double entendre, or a play on words somehow significant to interpretation? Finally, what is meant by "all flesh?" In opposition to God it should mean "mortal, human." But the proclamation of human frailty is here qualified by hasdo, "its loyalty."I Hesed is a cornucopia of meanings. The old, beautiful translation "lovingkindness," a blend of love and mercy, does not reflect the primarily covenantal associations of the term. Ilesed is the feeling of warm loyalty to one's covenant partner displayed by eager, ungrudging performance of one's obligations to him. It is a mixture of love and law beyond any narrow legalism. If davar means both "word" and "deed," hesed implies both emotion and action. If one emphasizes the former aspect, it comes to mean "love;" if the latter, "act of love." If God is expressing his hesed in mighty deeds, like the exodus and splitting of the Reed Sea, it can mean "act of power." He can be addressed as hasdi, "the one who displays hesed to me;" i.e., my protector, redeemer.O God's hesed lasts forever: ki le'olam hasdo, the refrain of Psalm 136. Israel displays its hesed by faithful performance of the covenantal commandments; that is how it "loves" God. Ilesed, as a covenantal term, implies a national frame of reference, God's relationship to his people. In short, "all flesh" in Isaiah 40, as modified by hasdo, "its loyalty," should refer to Israel. "Withering" in line five can then have two meanings. It can refer to the shrivelling of Israel's faith and obedience, its apostasy. As such it is a statement of national sin, an echo of prophetic rebuke (riv, tokheha). The "wind of the Lord" is then best taken literally, in terms of the metaphor: Israel's obedience was as impermanent as tender grass. But the same line can also refer to Israel's punishment for its sin. In this case "wind of the Lord" most likely has its anthropomorphic conno tation: God's blast of retribution. The resulting dessication is then a metaphor for the exile. Israel lies parched and in despair; cf., with another metaphorical application of dryness, E zekiel 37:2, 11-the famous valley of bones. Both constructions point to the possibility of a strikingly negative interpretation of line 8: "and the word of our God lasts forever!" In truth, one expects not "word" but hiesed, "loyalty of God;" cf. Psalm 103-15 ff 11 In a context of rebuke and retribution "word" can asily</page><page sequence="7">Were the Prophets Poets? 217 refer to the covenant curses for breach of contract, the tokhehot of Deuteronomy 28 and Leviticus 26. Above, the initial conjunction in line eight was translated "but," implying contrast with the preceding lines. Line eight we took as positive in meaning, a reference to the coming salvation. But it can also be translated simply "and," continuing and complementing, not contrasting with, the grassy metaphor: God's curse will last forever! Instinctively one feels that this negative interpretation is false; but what is the source of this "instinct?" Why is line eight so clearly a contrast with what precedes and so emphatically positive, almost ecstatic in tone? Perhaps it is only the contrast between the other parallel terms: "flesh" and "God," "grass/flowers" and "forever." But surely hesed and davar, "loyalty" and "word," are too heavy with biblical meaning to be mere adjuncts, deriving their power only from their propinquity to other terms! I think that the positive construction of line eight derives from, or at least is confirmed by, the intersection of the covenantal line of meaning implied by hasdo with another, prophetic, line of meaning. The "problems" and ambiguities are a device, strategy and tactics to steer us toward a goal. The specific clue to the new prophetic line is the "unclear" use of the phrase ruah adonai in a structure that makes it seem parallel to devar eloheinu. These intimations of a prophetic context would, I think, encourage the Hebrew ear to hear in these lines an echo of a famous prophetic genre, the inaugural vision. A prophet's account of his call serves to validate his mission. The form is basically clear, despite the fact that there are only a few complete examples, all of which display significant variations. Two elements are crucial to this discussion: the prophetic demurral and divine reassur ance.12 The prophet resists his call by protesting his unfitness for his mission. God then reassures him that he will be given the ability to fulfill his task. In Isaiah 40 the call to "proclaim" in line one, followed by a response in line two, triggers one's perception of the inaugural context. Ma ekra is ambiguous. As "what shall I proclaim?" it is the prophet's request for the content of his commission. Lines three and four are then the angel's response. But the words may also mean "how can I proclaim?"-a protest or demurral.13 The following lines would then be understood as the reason for his refusal, his human frailty: "I, like all flesh, am but as grass. .. ." The quatrain of lines five to eight are the angel's answer. The pun on the two meanings of ruahz is the hinge device. The sense is: "flesh, like grass, may be withered by the wind but you, filled by the spirit of the Lord, will deliver his eternal word."'" If one perceives the inaugural pattern, and the quatrain as reassur ance to the prophet, a positive sense for line eight is guaranteed-also</page><page sequence="8">218 STEPHEN A. GELLER on the level of covenantal meaning. This is the source of our "instinct" that the message of line eight is positive. It is the result of literary strategy, the intersection of complexes of form and meaning. The implications are radical: this passage works on two levels at least. It refers to the prophet's call and simultaneously to Israel's relationship to God. Both lines of meaning, individual-prophetic and national-covenantal, merge in line eight. It is heard as encouragement to the prophet, a statement of his commission, and, on the covenantal level, as a proclamation that Israel's period of suffering is over, its redemption is at hand.15 Such a dual interpretation is feasible only if all the key terms work on all levels. An obvious thorn is hasdo in line three. What sense does it make in the inaugural context? Why should a prophet compare his loyalty to grass? Most likely it represents, like line eight, a merging of prophetic and national levels, through a shift in perspective, as some commentators have noticed. The prophet is identifying himself with the people's sin, just as he shares their punishment in exile. So also the First Isaiah says (6:5): "I am a man of unclean lips who dwells in the midst of a people of unclean lips." The thorn is itself a rose: line four like line eight is enriched by the symbiosis of interpretations. The plural suffix of eloheinu, "our God," seals the effect. However, the truly climactic intersection of meanings is in the final le'olam of line eight. If one has become attuned to the play of nuances, and especially the relationship between hasdo, "his loyalty," and davar, "word, deed," one must hear in the final le'olam an echo of the famous refrain ki le'olam hasdo, "his loyalty lasts forever!" The coming redemption is the latest, and greatest, act of God's covenantal love. Indeed, this is the true meaning of the entire passage: man's (the prophet's, Israel's) ability to keep the covenant may have "withered," but despite the pattern of sin and punishment God's covenantal ardor remains undiminished. He is ready to begin again, as he did at the exodus, an event Second Isaiah uses as a model for the return from exile. And once again prophet and people merge; for the immediate sign of God's continuing hesed is his willingness to speak again to Israel through his prophets. The same duality of levels is also found in the opening words of Second Isaiah's mission, 40:1: "Comfort, comfort my people, says your God." On the one hand, God directs his messengers, prophets or angelic heralds, to deliver their commission to Israel. On the other hand, he steps outside this line of mediated discourse to address the people directly. The unmediated message is covenantal. The clue is the relationship between the words "my people" and "your God." An Israelite would surely have heard in them an echo of the classic covenant formulary, "You will be my people and I shall be your God." The true sense of the verse lies in the perceptual merger of prophetic and covenantal lines.</page><page sequence="9">Were the Prophets Poets? 219 The real "comfort" is precisely the renewal of the unbroken covenant relationship, despite the exile, as signified by renewed prophetic activity. The meaning is more subtle, but at the same time more effective emo tionally and more persuasive, because it is the result of simultaneous perceptions mediated by language.16 If one accepts dual or even multi-leveled17 interpretations of such passages as the peshat, then one has, of course, conceded that their authors can be literary artists, perhaps even poets. They are using language the way poets do, manipulating its potentialities, consciously or uncon sciously, to produce structures rich in meaning and forceful in emotion. In Isaiah 40:6-7 the poetic intention is achieved by a coalescence of covenantal and prophetic lines of interpretation in the reader's mind. This duality of meaning is made possible by the "problems" and ambi guities of form and meaning: the indistinctness of the structural rela tionship of lines one and two to three through eight; the polyvalence of the metaphors "all flesh," "grass, flowers;" the double meanings of ruah, "wind, spirit," and davar, "word, deed." The form of the repetition quatrain fuses these potentialities and focuses them on line eight, whose climactic emotional effect is like a thunderclap. This prophet can be a poet. But may he be? The question of propriety must now be raised. Perhaps the prophet's poetic skill negates his claim to prophecy itself. Second Isaiah's claim to true prophetic inspiration has been considered suspect by many scholars. After all, he is an anonymous prophet. The form of the commissioning inaugural vision is only echoed, not boldly declared as it is by the first Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel. Perhaps this diffidence reflects his own suspicions in regard to his status as prophet. One can perhaps save him from imputations of false prophecy by a dogmatic assertion that his work may not be viewed as poetry, even if it can be. There can be no logical objection to such an assertion; but one must understand that it means beggaring his richness. For example, in 40:6-8 one must declare only one line of interpretation, covenantal or prophetic, to be the sole meaning of the passage, the unique bearer of the prophetic "intent." The lines are then not a true poem but a simple document transmitting a simple message for simple understanding. This is, in fact, the standard procedure in most works of biblical exegesis, either because of religious dogmatism or a mistaken under standing of historical method as applied to literary study. Competing interpretations of a passage are often subjected to a ruthless process of amputation until only the "fittest" survives as bearer of the sole true meaning. Ambiguities are only problems to be eliminated, not oppor tunities for exegetical enrichment. But what infallible standard of scientific judgment, what sensitive insight of literary feeling justifies such a process of deliberate impover ishment? How can one excise potential meanings if they are legitimate</page><page sequence="10">220 STEPHEN A. GELLER in terms of language and Israel's known system of beliefs and traditions? To declare that a poem may not be studied as such violates the principles of science, literature and language. Prophet or poet-if there is a conflict between them perhaps it will eventually be resolved by what they have in common: davar, the word. Poetry is art in words; the prophet transmits divine speech. But all words are divine creations; for if, according to Genesis, the first created thing was light, the first act in the process of creation itself was "And God said ...." Dropsie College NOTES 1. Cf. Lindblom, J. Prophecy in Ancient Israel (Philadelphia, 1967), p. 1. Reference is to the etymology of Greek proph?tes, not Hebrew navi, whose root meaning is disputed. 2. On rabbinic "forgetting" of poetry, including parallelism, see most recently James L. Kugel, The Idea of Biblical Poetry (New Haven and London, 1981). 3. The conjunction of terms here and in D.N. Freedman's "Pottery, Poetry and Prophecy: An Essay on Biblical Poetry," Journal of Biblical Literature 96 (1977), is mainly coincidental. 4. A fuller presentation of the method and the theory validating it, as applied to biblical and other ancient texts, will be made elsewhere. 5. Of course, the division into lines and couplets assumes a prosodie analysis of the passage and so prejudges the issue of its status as "poetry." However, no details regarding metrical structure and parallelism will be provided to further prejudice the case. I cannot refrain from taking note of the strong phonetic patterning, aside from that produced by the repetitions. Note especially the alliterations: k and ' in lines one and two; the ss of the following lines, especially those of hasdo and hassade; the sequences of and sh in yavesh and nashva, etc. 6. Reading va ornar with the Greek version and the Dead Sea Scroll (IQIsa) for the Massoretic texts's ve'amar. Even if one retains the latter reading poetic analysis would be little affected. 7. Akhen hatsir ha'am, "truly the people is grass," is certainly an ancient gloss and nonsensical from the literary point of view. One does not explain a metaphor while in the very process of presenting it! The words reflect one interpretation of the image; on which, see below. 8. It seems intrusive only if one assumes the following statement: the loyalty of flesh is like (the loyalty) of grass and flowers." That grass is loyal to its own greenness and luxuriance is a pleasant conceit?cf. the German folksong O Tannenbaum, which imputes a like loyalty to the fir tree and also, in the Bible, Jotham's riddle in Judges 9:6 ff.?but arises here from a misunderstanding of the dynamics of the device of parallelism. The common emendations hemdo, hodo and hadaro, all meaning "beauty, glory" or the like, are all rooted in this misunderstanding; as is also the Greek version's doxa. The Targum's translation "strength" also reflects a particular interpretation; on all of which, see note 17. 9. So also ruah elohim of Genesis 1:2, probably, the most popular translation of which is now: "mighty wind soared over the waters." 10. So in Psalms 59:18 (and perhaps 11), 144:2; cf. LJ. Kuyper, "The Meaning of hsdw</page><page sequence="11">Were the Prophets Poets? 221 ISA XL 6," Veins Testamentum 13 (1963): 489-92 and Dahood (Anchor Bible on Psalms) on Psalm 59:11. That "strength" or "permanence" is the root meaning of hesed is debatable and probably irrelevant here, since it has such a meaning clearly only in the two places cited above; and even they may reflect the semantic extension. Hesed is parallel to oz, "strength," only in Exodus 15:13 and Psalm 62:12-13. To Israelites hesed implied covenant and loyalty not only to divine but also to human contracts; cf. 2 Samuel 3:8, 9:1. 11. Psalm 103:15 ff. is similar in thought and language to Isaiah 40:6-8 and presents just such an equation. Man's days are like grass but God's hesed is forever to those who keep his covenant. The context is sin and punishment. So also Psalm 90, another famous use of the grass motif. Note also the traditional interpretation of hatsir as reshaim, "the wicked:" so, for example, the Targum. See also Hosea 6:4 for another metaphor with a similar meaning. 12. Exodus 4:10 ff.; Isaiah 6:5; Jeremiah 1:6 13. On ma as "how" see Gesenius 148a-b, Joiion 144e. 14. Nashva is a hapax, as is nashaf of verse 24. Both are perhaps related to the common nasham. B/p interchange is well attested, and m is also a labial. It is not unlikely that line six is to be heard in two ways: "the wind of the Lord blows against it (flesh)" and "the spirit of the Lord blows into him;" so that the whole line is a double entendre and not just the nouns. 15. The merging of "word" and "deed" in the sense of prophetic oracle and act of redemption probably also foreshadows Second Isaiah's famous "argument from prophecy." It is important to him that the coming act of salvation was predicted by past prophets. Its fulfillment is thus a sign of God's power and sovereignty as well as his loyalty and mercy. God's word, past as well as present, must find fulfillment; it never returns "empty" (55:11). 16. For a detailed analysis of these lines see my forthcoming article. 17. In fact, there is almost certainly yet a third level of meaning in Isaiah 40:6-8. "All flesh" may refer not to man in general but to the nations (and their rulers). The trigger is the occurrence of the phrase in verse five: vera'u kol basar yahdav, "all flesh will see it together." Such witnessing of God's acts of redemption may apply to Israel (cf. 41:20) but most often to the nations; cf. 41:5; 52:10,15, etc. The motif of vegetational impermanence is used of rulers in 40:24. If "all flesh" refers to them here, their "withering" may express their general vacuousness, a favorite theme of the prophet; or refer specifically to the fall of Babylon (so Ehrlich, although it is most unlikely that ha am of the gloss refers to the Chaldeans, as he suggests). Hasdo, "loyalty," seems more intrusive here than in the other two lines of interpreta tion. In truth, the common emendation hemdo fits quite well (cf. hemdat kol haggoyim in Haggai 2:7). "Beauty, pride, wealth, glory"?some such nuance corresponds to the standard crime of the nations in biblical literature, hubris; on the "withering" of prideful beauty (tif'eret) cf. Isaiah 28:1. If one eliminates hasdo the covenantal line of meaning disappears. However, since there are still two simultaneous levels of meaning the basic point of this exercise remains unaffected. Yet even hasdo may not be impossible in regard to the nations. The suffix may be the logical subject: "the one from whom they expect acts of hesed, their source of confidence" or the like; cf. hasdi in Psalms 59:18 and 144:1, cited above. In line four it might refer to the gods of the nations, foreshadowing Second Isaiah's frequent polemic against idolatry. The Targum's tqphwn, "their strength," may reflect such an interpretation. Less likely, but not impossible, is that hesed has the meaning it has in Leviticus 20:17 and Proverbs 14:34: "abomination" or the like. The latter verse is cited by several medieval commentaries in connection with Isaiah 40:6; cf. perhaps also Jonah 2:9. Hesed in this sense is an "Aramaism" and may be an Aramaic-Hebrew pun; cf. motsi in 43:17 (Hebrew "bring out," Aramaic "destroy") and orah in 41:3 (Hebrew "road," Aramaic "chain"). If one retains hasdo the passage then contains a triple meaning. It is the prophet's commission; reassurance to Israel (the promised "comfort" of 40:1); and a statement of the imminent act of redemption, the overthrow of Babylon.</page></plain_text>
