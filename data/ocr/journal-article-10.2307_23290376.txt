<plain_text><page sequence="1">I i became a lawyer for two rea sons. First, I saw one too many Perry Mason shows in which Ray mond Burr humiliated Hamilton Burger. Burger was a lifetime prosecutor who, along with Lt. Tragg, always seemed to miss that witness who stood up in the back of the court room during the trial and yelled, "I did it. I did it." Just the pattern told me that Mr. Burger was not the swiftest prosecutor in the world. After about the seventh season, had I been Burger, I would have stood at the entrance to the court and screened entrants: "Excuse me, but are you planning any outbursts, Jennings is a professor of legal and eth ical studies in the College of Business at Arizona State University in Tempe, Ariz. By MARIANNE We can't get confessions or other emotional dis closures designed to help Ray mond Burr win an Emmy?" I quickly learned the distinction between CBS television and actual criminal trial practice when a per son in the back of the courtroom stood up, pointed to my client and said, "He did it. I saw him do it." You can't get good audience con fessions any more. And there are no prosecutors of the Burger cal iber. But the second reason I became BUSINESS LAW TODAY May/June 1995 Ethics can only a lawyer is because it is a profes sion of dignity, knowledge and ser vice. Despite the heavy doses of reality and the antics of the O.J. Simpson case, I remain proud to be a lawyer. Despite the humiliation of law school's Socratic method, I did develop analytical skills along with a strong sense of pubic service and the obligations of a lawyer as an officer of the court. I want to continue to claim membership in the bar. I wish to continue to state with pride that I 32 By MARIANNE We can't get Ethics can only</page><page sequence="2">M. JENNINGS no respect help lawyers am a lawyer. Presently, what with all the lawyer jokes and all, I'm just not sure it's a wise idea. I have been known to admit, "Yes, I am a lawyer, but I don't fraternize with other lawyers except within the bounds of matrimony" It appears that the man or woman on the street has difficulty grasping the notions of profession al responsibility. It appears the average person misunderstands the role of advocacy In fact, many men on the streets are lying in wait with several others prepared to assault with overripe kumquats anyone who walks by carrying a legal pad or a Mont Blanc pen or whistling the Perry Mason theme. Our profession has lost its respect. But in a comeback mode, we can reclaim respect. We must, however, face professional realties and adopt standards of conduct beyond the Model Rules of Profes sional Conduct. The rules were intended as statements of positive law: They are the lowest threshold for lawyer conduct. However, they have become the highest standard of professional conduct. To reclaim our stature, we must reclaim our standards. Ethics beyond the standardized rules should be our focus. In many cases, we must remind those we repre sent that decisions have to be based on higher standards than mere compliance. If we think the man (in its anthropomorphic sense) on the street is wrong (and we're con cerned about the kumquat thing), we need look no further than the news to find the source of lay-per son animosity and most of the lawyer jokes. Consider the follow ing headline incidents involving lawyers: • In a savings and loan case, a judge, in a moment of frustration asks, "Where were the lawyers?" The lawyers' responses: "Well, where were the auditors?" "Where... ABA SECTION OF BUSINESS LAW 33 M. JENNINGS no respect help lawyers</page><page sequence="3">were the corporate boards? Truly these folks were equally at fault." Not quite, and certainly not equal ly, because lawyers are designated as officers of the court. • In the R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Chap ter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, one law firm represented Macy while also representing three of Macy's largest creditors. Another law firm represented the court-appointed mediator in the case and also a suitor in the bids for taking over Macy's. • Two San Francisco firms were fined $25,000 for costly and unnec essary "fishing expeditions" during discovery. The portrait these headlines and others portray is not a flattering one. We could make excellent rebuttal points in each case but could not change public percep tion. In fact, I could defend any of the examples above as conduct within the Model Rules. I can toss the old canons and DRs with the best of them. But, the nuances of our Rules escape the public. The man on the street, armed with the latest in lawyer humor, doesn't follow the distinction between partner conflict and partnership conflict. A conflict is a conflict to the average person who does not plan to rise and confess to capital murder. As lawyers, we define ethics dif ferently than we might personally or in a business setting. I believe our definitions must change. I pro pose that the Model Rules be large ly ignored. The sound of cheering you hear is coming from law stu dents everywhere ecstatic with the notion of eliminating canons, rules, DRs and a required and boring course from the curriculum. We must progress beyond the standard CLE hypothetical: Partner A has just embezzled $6.2 million from Client A and was last seen in Miami boarding a flight for Rio while wearing plastic nose glasses. Has Partner A violated any pro visions of the Model Rules? Partner A was long gone ethical ly before he ever encountered the Model Rules. A basic grasp of per sonal and business ethics goes a long way in avoiding memoriza tion of the Rules. We lawyers need personal ethics. I'm an ivory-tower professor, but I still have sufficient real world experience to know it's a heck of a lot easier to be unethical than ethi cal. I also recognize that ethical behavior sometimes earns you the much-coveted title "pain in the neck" (you may substitute other body parts as suits your particular style). Let's face it, we all cheer for Dr. Jack Ryan, i.e., Harrison Ford, in "Clear and Present Danger," as the designated Boy Scout of the CIA. But many of us are also say ing, "Who could work with this guy?" However, we all not only need to work with Jack Ryan, we need to be him. If Ryan isn't reason enough for you, I can offer four other really good reasons for a strong commit ment to ethical values. First, and this should catch your eye as well as that of your clients: You are going to make more money. While the field of ethics in business is new (that is the study o/business ethics is new), we do have suffi cient studies and statistical evi dence to indicate that there is at least some correlation between eth ical behavior and earnings. The first study comes to us from the Ethics Resource Center based in Washington, D.C. (what better place to study ethics, eh?). Its study compared a Dow Jones com posite performance with the perfor mance of 21 companies with the fewest number of federal regulatory and criminal violations. If you had invested $30,000 in the Dow Jones composite 30 years ago, you would have $134,000 today. But if you had invested that same $30,000 in the companies with the fewest vio lations (again, the author empha sizes that violation of the law is a fairly low common denominator for ethical standards), you would BUSINESS LAW TODAY May/June 1995 have $1,021,861 today. In a second study, if one exam ines companies that have been able to pay dividends consistently for a 100-year period, one would find diversity in products, size, loca tion, etc. But a common thread among a total of eight unique firms in this category of consistent divi dent payments is a strong state ment of values and commitment to customers, employees and commu nities. This study, by Professor Louis Grossman, director of Ari zona State University's Lincoln Center for Ethics, is more com pelling when we realize that these firms had their codes of ethics and value statements in place long before we woke up in the '80s and realized that this ethics stuff is important. In a recent edition of Business Ethics, it was reported that Exxon spent $3.2 billion to settle various claims from the Valdez Spill since the time of the spill (not counting the most recent settlements). Over that same period of time, Exxon's profits totaled $5.8 billion. In a study I conducted during my last sabbatical, I examined what I thought would be a study of what causes litigation. I went into it believing that levels of litigation would be tied to what the industry did; banks would have higher lev els of litigation just by virtue of the number of contracts banks write for loans. The results surprised me. For example, a small hotel had more litigation (more cases filed during a three-year period) than a large bank. However, quite accidentally I requested information from each firm on their codes of ethics. I was just planning to lift them for class use (how's that for ethics?). But the codes, or lack thereof, turned out to be revealing. The small hotel refused to release its code of ethics, adding that it was proprietary. Another firm with a high litigation rate couldn't find its code of ethics. Still another firm with a dispropor tionately large amount of litigation 34</page><page sequence="4">noted that it had not worked on or used its code of ethics since 1982. A second reason for making eth ical choices in both our profession al and personal lives is what I refer to as baggage prevention. In a nut shell, ethical choices offer a worry free life. Opportunities are not lost because there have been no previ ous unethical choices. For example, I have always paid my FICA, FUTA, flora and fauna on the wages paid to our house hold employees. By all rights, I should be the attorney general of the United States. At least with respect to nanny taxes, I have no character issues, taint of noncom pliance, or other exposure fears. Well, I do have the swiping-codes of-ethics problem I've just dis closed. A third reason for making good choices is that a reputation, good or bad, stays with us. The Beech Nut Co. was, in 1983, close to mak ing major in-roads in market share of the baby food/juice market. Beech-Nut became Gerber's first major competitor. The New York Times rated Beech-Nut baby apple juice as the best-tasting juice on the market. The problem was that Beech Nut's apple juice had no juice in it — it was a good-tasting chemical concoction. Eventually, through a former Beech-Nut employee who wrote to the FDA as Johnny Apple seed, Beech-Nut was exposed. Offi cers were indicted, and Beech-Nut's market share plum meted. Despite the fact that the "juice" did not harm any babies, Beech-Nut's choice of reducing costs tainted its reputation. More than 10 years later, its market share is not yet back at the pre-1983 level. The converse is also true: A good reputation has staying power. From 1976-1986, Arizona State University ran an evening paralegal program with many of the best lawyers, judges and paralegals in the area as instructors. The pro gram enjoyed an excellent reputa tion among firms and agencies. In surveys on paralegal programs in Arizona, the program was rated No. 1 or 2. Those ratings continued — through 1989; for three years past 1986 when the program was ended because of funding cuts. The fourth and final reason for an ethical commitment is that without good voluntary choices, we end up with demanding and costly regulation. All laws and reg ulations can be traced back to a time when fairness and ethics dic tated the type of conduct that regu lation now mandates. For example, statutorily man dated credit disclosures on credit cards, mortgages and home equity loans are the result of perceived or actual unfairness to borrowers. The borrowers simply wanted information on how much they would be paying. Creditors had the ability to disclose credit costs voluntarily, but abuses led to the still-expanding statutory scheme regulating credit extension and disclosures. I offer my students $100 and an A if they can bring me a statute or regulation that cannot be traced back to a period of voluntariness — a time when fair and ethical choices would have avoided the eventual and generally complex regulation. I've given my shares of A's, but haven't paid out $100; the A's have been earned in other ways. Drawing the following graph on the board depicting my ethics vs. regulation proposition makes me feel very grown-up and somewhat Greenspanish. The students have a new-found respect for me as they realize that lawyers can draw swinging curves as well as econo mists. Jennings' Ethics v. Regulation Time ABA SECTION OF BUSINESS LAW 35</page><page sequence="5">As an issue progresses over time, the public becomes aware of a problem and, with enough abus es, becomes actively involved in reform efforts, which eventually results in litigation or regulation or both. The lawyer jokes and dam age-limitation movements place our profession at the activism stage. People perceive unfairness and move toward reform. It is criti cal to understand that perception moves the issue forward — not reality. Regulation results because of public perceptions of unfairness. Now some of you out there are no doubt saying, "OK, you've con vinced me that ethics is a good thing. Now tell me how to do it." Others of you out there are no doubt saying, "She lost me on the graph." Recognition of ethical dilemmas is difficult because all have different backgrounds, cultures and values. Nonetheless, there are ways to spot an ethical dilemma. Watch the language. Key phrases signal unfairness, impropriety or abuses. And here they are (Note: These phrases are better than the graph). Types of unethical conduct If the language doesn't tip you off to unethical behavior, then use the following list to help spot it. Categories of unethical behavior 1. Taking things that don't belong to you. 2. Saying things you know aren't true. 3. Giving or allowing false impres sions. 4. Buying influence or engaging in conflict of interest. 5. Hiding information that should be disclosed or divulging informa tion that is proprietary 6. Taking unfair advantage. 7. Committing or engaging in per sonal decadence. 8. Perpetrating interpersonal abuse. 9. Permitting organizational abuse. 10. Violating rules. 11. Condoning unethical actions. 12. Balancing ethical dilemmas. Perhaps the most difficult form of ethical dilemma for people who are in the midst of one to recognize is a conflict of interest. Others, especially the media, spot them BUSINESS LAW TODAY May/June 1995 quickly. When conflicts involve us, we have difficulty seeing them. The reaction to a conflict-of-inter est charge is the same by at least one of the parties involved: "How dare you question my integrity!" Leaving politics aside, we know (from the parties' admissions) that the legal counsel for Tyson Foods, a large and heavily regulated busi ness in Arkansas, in some way assisted Hillary Clinton (then wife of the attorney general of Arkansas who also happened to be running for governor) in making cattle futures trades. The wife of the top law enforcement official of the state benefits from the conduct of the Tyson lawyer. We have a con flict of interest. Whether one would let that assistance influence conduct or decisions is not the point. Both sides might not understand that the assistance is not intended as a quid pro quo. Conflicts of interest are ethical breaches in and of them selves because of the temptation and propensity for quid pro quo. Information in the hands of lawyers or employees is propri etary. A recent example of an ethi cal violation involves the IRS. Employees were rifling our files out of curiosity (i.e., they want to know how much folks make — I can just see a group of them sitting around in Ogden, Utah, saying things like, "Herb, pull up Arnold Schwarzenegger next. See if you can get Howard Stern's Schedule C on the screen!"). Misuse of infor mation, either way, by withholding when its disclosure is mandated, or divulging it when privacy or pro prietary issues are at stake, is an ethical breach. "What goes around comes around" is colloquial for taking unfair advantage. The way we treat others, both fairly and unfairly, comes back to help us or haunt us. An M&amp;M Mars executive tells the story of a cacao purchase in which one of Mars' buyers was instructed to pay a higher price for a cacao crop. When questioned on Jennings' key phrases for spotting conduct most lizards would find unethical y else does it." 't do it, someone e se will.' 1. "Everybody els 2. "If we don' 3. "That's the way it's always been done." 4. "It doesn't really hurt anyone.' 5. "The system is unfair." 6. "Who's to 36</page><page sequence="6">the decision to increase the price, management's response was that the deal was negotiated during a coup, and M&amp;M Mars would be taking advantage of the political impact on a grower's decision to sell quickly at any price. A long range view was that when the market became a seller's market, M&amp;M Mars would likewise be treated fairly. And it was. Its cost of goods sold remained stable dur ing a subsequent market spike because of their fair treatment of the grower. An oft-given justification for unethical behavior is, "Yeah, I vio lated the rules (law), but the rule (law) is dumb." And quite possi bly the observation about dumb ness is correct. Ethical behavior mandates compliance. I watched Donald Kennedy when he was president of Stanford struggle to explain dumb rules on applications for federal grants. Stanford chose not to follow the rules. That choice cost Kennedy his presidency and Stanford alumni support. Ethical breaches do not come in degrees: If you misuse federal funds, how do I know you won't misuse my dona tions? When we allow others to com mit ethical violations, we ourselves are engaged in unethical behavior. I often think of the partners in Price Waterhouse who allowed evalua tions of Ann Hopkins that used phrases such as "needs make-up," or "should take a charm school course" to go forward in the process that denied her partner sta tus. Why didn't someone object? Where were the partners? Why didn't someone speak up for this rainmaker? Ethical dilemmas are complex, but resolution often comes through the application of simple focus questions or models. Model No. 1 comes from Kenneth Blanchard (the one-minute manager guy) and the late Dr. Norman Vincent Peale (a minister who devoted his life to encouraging positive choices). So, Model 1 is basically the one minute manager and a minister do ethics. And here it is, in less than one minute. 1. Is it legal? (If not, I would stop here. If it is illegal, it is, by defini tion, unethical. Also, most ethical folks do not spend a great deal of time behind bars). 2. Is it balanced? Look for the standard of fairness or rephrase: Is this how I would want to be treat ed? 3. How does it make me feel? Discomfort in the forms of too little appetite, too much appetite, too lit tle sleep, too much sleep. Another model that I used when I held public office (as a commissioner on the state's utili ty-regulating body) is one that forces us to think through percep tions. How would an informed and critical reporter view my con duct? You'll note I did not say "objective reporter." Too oxy moronish. Salomon Brothers' new CEO, Warren Buffet, post bond-trading scandal clean-up, said, "We simply want no part of any activities that pass legal tests but that we, as citi zens, would find offensive. Con templating any business act, an employee should ask himself whether he would be willing to see it immediately described on the front page of his local paper, there to be read by his spouse, children and friends." Business ethicist Laura Nash has a 13-question model for evaluating ethical dilemmas. I've never been able to memorize all 13 questions, even if you threatened me with a quiz. However, three questions stick with me. The first is whether you could discuss your decision with the affected parties. This question just eliminates embezzlement as an eth ical choice altogether, doesn't it? The second question requires us to examine our short-term gains compared with possible long-term ABA SECTION OF BUSINESS LAW losses. As I read of the Kidder Peabody fiasco and investigation, I see Mr. Jett's short-term gains (of $9 million) in terms of his finan cial rewards and once-rapid career ascent. Over the long term, he has ended his business career and lost his professional reputation. Kidder Peabody and its reputation suf fered as well. The losses in the sale of Kidder and the resulting loss of employment for thousands are tragic costs of Mr. Jett's indiscre tion that sprang from a desire for short-term gains. All of the losses from derivatives, from Procter &amp; Gamble to Barings, sprang from a desire for short-term earnings. The long-term consequences have been devastating. Ms. Nash's third question I focus on is whether you could dis cuss your choice with those who are most important to you: family, friends, those with a view beyond the quarterly profits. Often, their perspective goes beyond "win ning" because of their concern for your reputation. Further, they can serve to break the group-think hold that produces unethical choices. For example, the dangers (in terms of health hazards) of asbestos were known to industry executive as early as the 1930s. Why did it take more than 30 years for an acknowledgment of those dangers? Those within the industry were protecting the industry, the jobs. Those outside might have observed, "But too many people are dying." The choice becomes clear once company loyalty is placed in perspective beside a view of actual harm. The bottom line in all of this: Ethics works. Ethics makes life eas ier, makes us more money and is something that could go a long way in restoring public confidence. I love the law. I love its fundamental notions of fairness. Indeed, I love its ethical base. It's time we remembered that in our conduct as officers of the court. ■ 37</page></plain_text>
