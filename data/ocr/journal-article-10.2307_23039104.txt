<plain_text><page sequence="1">[ 113 ] SERMON PREACHED AT FESTIVAL SERVICE IN THE CHAPEL OF TRINITY COLLEGE, DUBLIN, 10th July, 1953. By the Reverend Canon I. T. Ramsey, Nolloth Professor of the Philosophy of the Christian Religion in the University of Oxford. ' In Him we live and move and have our being.' —Acts xvii, 28. However inappropriate texts—whether for windows or sermons—may be, no one, I think, will question the pro priety of taking this text for a sermon commemorating George Berkeley. It is not that, so far as I can discover, the verse was ever used by Berkeley for one of his own sermons; but it occurs so often in his works as to have been called his ' favourite quotation '-1 He uses it, e.g., in the Principles to summarise his claim that God is involved in every perceptual situation : ' nothing can be more evident than the existence of God, or a spirit who is intimately present to our minds, producing in them all that variety of ideas or sensations, which continually affect us, on whom we have an absolute and entire dependence, in short in whom we live, and move, and ha,ve our being* Here is the climax of Berkeley's ' natural theology '. Now, I think we shall be misled, both historically as to his intentions, and philosophically as to his importance, if we claim that Berkeley the theologian is mainly memorable as being the author of a novel proof of God's existence; if we merely commemorate him for increasing 1 Works, edited Luce and Jessop (subsequently referred to as Works), vol. ii, p. 70n. 2 Ibid, vol. ii, p. 109. I</page><page sequence="2">114 SERMON PREACHED AT FESTIVAL the number of traditional proofs by one—possibly in two, maybe three—versions. For we have it from Berkeley himself that for him the greatest virtue of his natural theology was that it did not present men with the intricacies of an argument. Says Philonous in the Second Dialogue: ' You may now, without any laborious search into the sciences, without any subtlety of reason, or tedious length of discourse, oppose and baffle the most strenuous advocate for atheism.'3 It is a fact, remarks Berkeley (with no doubt a certain irony), that ' divines and philosophers had proved beyond all controversy, from the beauty and usefulness of the several parts of the creation, that it was the workmanship of God '.4 Even so, that we may now set ' aside all help of astronomy and natural philosophy, all contemplation of the contrivance, order and adjust ment of things ' and ' from the bare existence of the sensible world ' infer an ' infinite mind '—is, as he notes, a ' peculiar advantage \5 Nor need we be unsettled by his use of the word ' infer '. In Alciphron he has an alternative expression: ' at all times and in all places we perceive ' sensible signs which evince the being of God ' 6 and in the Principles he remarks that men only disbelieve by ' stupidity ' and ' inattention '—when ' blinded with excess of light ' or upon ' a wilful shutting of the eyes No doubt he tried to make the same point, viz., that he is commending no subtle intricate argument, no novel proof by his continual use of words like ' plain' and ' immediate'. But you may say, there precisely is the difficulty. In what sense do we ' see ' God ' plainly ' and ' immediately '? How is the word ' God ' necessarily involved in the full description of every perceptual situation? Suppose we were coming fresh to those questions; imagine us sharing with a young Berkeley the working 3 Works, vol. ii, p. 213. 4, 5 Works, vol. ii, p. 212 (italics mine). 6 Works, vol. iii, p. 147 (italics mine). 7 Works, vol. ii, pp. 109 and 112.</page><page sequence="3">SERVICE IN TRINITY COLLEGE, DUBLIN. 115 out of his view; talking with him in some room in this college. There would be two obvious moves theoretically possible for us to make. We might first hazard the guess that the word ' God ' is like the words ' matter ' absolute time ' absolute space ' of some physicist philosophers, or mathematicians. At this, of course, Berkeley, the antagonist of ' abstract ideas ' would protest violently. Anticipating a Russell he would protest, as he does in Alciphron, against the ' current opinion that every substantive name marks out and exhibits .... one distinct idea separate from all others '.8 Some names refer to nothing whatever. They are just brawling. For instance, ' matter ' and ' absolute time ' refer to nothing—at most they are pleasing noises. Make ' God ' logically similar (as Kant, to some extent, did when he made it an Idea of Reason used regulatively) and you have words without meaning, a theology but no God, and ' polemical divines' 9 would be warmed by nothing but the hot air of their own making. It is not so much, you see, that there are no abstract ideas—though Berkeley may express it thus; it is rather that the words referring to abstract ideas are empirically bankrupt. On this account, it will be remembered Berkeley criticises Malebranche, who ' builds on the most abstract general ideas which I entirely disclaim '.10 But, stay ! Berkeley, you will reply, allows that the words referring to abstract ideas may have some empirical use: they may be founded in various ways on ' particular things ' 11: may not ' God ' likewise have some sort of reference to ' particular things '? Yes; but if ' God ' referred to an abstract idea in this sense it would refer significantly to nothing else but to such ' particular things '; and this he cannot allow. Berkeley is adamant that the significance of ' God ' is not reducible 8 Works, vol. iii, p. 293. 9 Works, vol. iii, p. 103. 10 Works, vol. ii, p. 214. 11 Works, vol. iii, p. 305.</page><page sequence="4">116 SERMON PREACHED AT FESTIVAL to any group of such ' idea-particulars Why? The reason is, for Berkeley, plain and explicit : indeed, if we may say so, without irreverence, sauce for God is sauce for ' any other spirit' as well—' these being active, cannot be represented by things perfectly inert, as our ideas are.' So says Philonous in the Third Dialogue.12 What possibility then remains? The word ' God ' is not a word referring to some altogether ' abstract idea ' or else it would be merely noise; nor is it a word which, being more respectably ' abstract ' reduces to, and so relates wholly to ' ideas What, then, is its logical setting? The answer is suggested by Philonous but a sentence or so afterwards: ' I know what I mean by terms I and myself' ,1S and their factual anchorage is what he calls ' a reflex act \13 Now this logical oddity of ' I ' and this empirical curiosity called a ' reflex act '—are both signified by his introduction of the word ' notion '. We each have a ' notion ' of our own activity. The point is made again in Alciphron VII. ' An active .... spirit cannot be an idea .... words which denote an active spirit do not stand for ideas. And yet they are not insignificant neither; since I understand what is signified by the term I, or myself, or know what it means, although it be no idea, nor like an idea, but that which .... operates about them. Certainly it must be allowed that we have some notion that we understand, or know what is meant by, the terms myself, will, memory, love, hate, and so forth; although, to speak exactly, these words do not suggest so many distinct ideas.' 14 Likewise, we have a notion of God. Here, in ' notions ', is, I believe, the clue to much that is difficult and unresolved in Berkeley; the heart at once of his theology and of his Christian apologetic: a point of permanent importance and, I venture to think, of special contemporary significance for us. True, to make Berkeley 12 Works, vol. ii, p. 231 (capitals mine). 13 Works, vol. ii, pp. 231-232. 14 Works, vol. iii, p. 292.</page><page sequence="5">SERVICE IN TRINITY COLLEGE, DUBLIN. 117 satisfactory, I think we must needs suppose that the ' reflex act '—what he calls elsewhere ' inward feeling ' 15 and in De Motu ' conscientia quadam interna ' 16—to make him satisfactory we must suppose that this self awareness is rather self-other awareness, so that the reference of ' notions ' is to what is more straightforwardly called a ' self-other active interchange And if this savours of a view of ' experiential unities ' closer to the 19th century than to the 18th, I will only say that I think Berkeley has suggestions in that direction even though this is not the occasion to argue them. At present let us rather develop the point that only with the flowering of notions does Berkeley's work come near to completion; only then does his full philosophical importance begin to show itself. To do this it is necessary to take up a word I deliberately omitted from the quotations a moment ago—the word ' properly We have ' properly no idea, either of God, or any other spirit': or again, ' words which denote an active spirit do not in a strict and proper sense stand for ideas But in a vaguer sense, and since our activity is always concerned with some ' idea ' particulars; then our ' reflex act ' has a double signification : it includes idea particulars while it extends beyond them, so that the words relating to these ideas will be appropriate currency so far as they go. But there is a residue, and to refer to that residue we use each for ourselves other words of a different logic whose factual reference is not exhausted by the public idea in terms of which in part their significance can be given. Of this oddness of fact and grammar ' I ' is the permanent witness for each one of us : and ' God with the same logical status, is that word which with ' I ' shares in the characterisations of the self-other active interchange. ' I ' and ' God ' co-refer to a fact of being which lives and moves. So has Berkeley won through, and to a position midway 15 Works, vol. ii, p. 80. 16 Works, vol. iv, p. 16.</page><page sequence="6">118 SERMON PREACHED AT FESTIVAL between Malebranche and the ' Minute Philosophers As we have noticed, not only had Malebranche his ' abstract general ideas but with these went a mystical disregard and philosophical belittling of the ' world of sense True, Berkeley might say with Malebranche that ' in God we live and move and have our being ' 17 but for Berkeley part of the reference of this word ' God ' was to particular ideas-—to that external world which Malebranche belittled. On the other hand, Berkeley was no ' reductionist '. Not all empirical reference was exhausted by these ' ideas ' God ethical words like ' love ' and ' hate ', metaphysical words like ' freedom ', all have some sort of reference to that reflex act, that ' self-other active encountering' which, while it included ideas, was more. So, to take up our original point, we ' see ' God not in Malebranche's sense which might be said to be completely unintelligible, nor altogether in the sense in which we ' see ' ' ideas ' Seeing God ' is not to be modelled in terms of sensing a ' collection of ideas ', this is intelligible but inadequate; nor do we see him by discerning somehow or other his ' essence '—that is altogether wwintelligible says Berkeley : the ' metaphysical hypothesis of our seeing all things in God by the union of the human soul with the intelligible substance of the Deity ' is something ' which neither I, nor any one else could make sense of \18 Rather do we see God ' as plain as we see any human person whatsoever ' and he ' daily speaks to our senses in a manifest and clear dialect ' 18: ' In Him we live and move and have our being.' We see God as we see a man; God and people are what we meet. But we do not meet just ' bods ', nor is a self other encounter the same as the physical crush of a queue.19 Notional awareness of spirits and God is characterised by ideas, but not adequately. Such is the background to 17 Works, vol. ii, p. 214. 18 Works, vol. iii, p. 159. 19 This would be Berkeley's line of reply to Antony Flew, University, vol. ii, No. 2. (Discussion on ' Death ".)</page><page sequence="7">SERVICE IN TRINITY COLLEGE, DUBLIN. 119 Berkeley's claim in Alciphron IV that the world is ' divine visual language and to his claim (with which the sermon started) that nothing is more ' evident ' than the existence of God—' plain ' and ' immediate Broadening our theme at this point we may notice that such reflections as these help us better to see the significance of the text from Jeremiah ii, 13 which Berkeley places at the front of Alciphron—a text illustrated in that edition of 1732 which is displayed in the College library. ' They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns that can hold no water.' The minute philosophers, the ' men of strong heads ', the minimisers with a vengeance, had forsaken an actively encountered God—a living God : and instead had taken hold of static ideas—stone cisterns of their own making, but broken and partial, and quite unable to hold the (living and active) water which it was their intention to contain. An active ' God ', because the word referred to more than ideas, they denied; religion claiming to ' inspire' dutiful behaviour they called ' a State trick20 ' all stings of conscience and sense of guilt ' 20—those moral experiences which likewise are logical oddities, they reduced to ' prejudices and errors of education '; 20 man was no agent; he was ' a machine . . . a curious piece of clock-work '.20 This was atheism par excellence: and Berkeley triumphed over it in so far as he measured not only its force, but also its inadequacy, in so far as he had ideas but also notions. He was a sceptic, ' Minute ' indeed, but more. Yet Berkeley's difficulties are by no means over: and though some may wish that this sermon was, I think that in a Commemoration of Berkeley we must needs indicate how this broad philosophical approach to natural theology, this technique of ideas and notions that it involved, stood him in excellent stead when he faced contemporary 20 Works, vol. iii, p. 107.</page><page sequence="8">120 SERMON PREACHED AT FESTIVAL controversies on traditional themes. Of these we will select only two:— (i) the problem of theological anthropomorphism: human predicates are needed for intelligibility, yet are naively inadequate for devotion, leaving room for neither mystery nor transcendence, if these can be properly distinguished. (ii) the problem of having Christianity both reasonable and distinctive. Curiously enough, and as Berkeley himself notices in the case of the first problem, neither problem is unrelated to that sermon of St. Paul from which our text was taken. We will begin with the problem of anthropomorphism. Amongst the comparative few who were moved by St. Paul's preaching, was, we are told, Dionysius the Areopagite, and legend (though I fear only legend) associates him with what Berkeley calls in the Fourth Dialogue of Alciphron 'a very singular style ',21 God is ' above all essence and life ' above all wisdom and understanding '.21 Here is ' negative theology ' with a vengeance: and in it is implied a permanent problem which also happened to be the centre of a con temporary controversy in Dublin; Can theology be both intelligible and transcendent; reasonable yet mysterious? In 1696 there had appeared Toland's ' Christianity not Mysterious '—a book which starting from Locke's view of the ' Reasonableness of Christianity' contrived to make Locke even plainer and more intelligible than he had himself intended. For Locke had allowed for the possibility of ' mystery', of truths ' above reason ', though he had done little to treat of them adequately. Toland was not long in completing Locke's job of ' underlabouring ' so well as to get rid (so he thought) of this rubbish, too. In opposition to Toland, Peter Browne, soon to become Provost of this College, urged that ' mystery ' could be defended by some doctrine of analogy; but Archbishop 21 Works, vol. iii, p. 166 italics mine).</page><page sequence="9">SERVICE IN TRINITY COLLEGE, DUBLIN. 121 King of Dublin some twelve years later went further and fared worse—talking of the ' metaphorical' use of words in relation to God. Here were the extremes meeting in controversy: ' minute philosophers ' like Toland at best denying mystery to defend intelligibility; theologians like King, defending mystery, but at the cost of an unintel ligible theology. Berkeley is notable indeed for having, in his doctrine of notions including but going beyond ideas, a middle way. Further, if the Angelic Doctor and Provost Browne do not object to each other's company22 we may say that though Berkeley's outlook had express sympathies with the doctrine of analogy common to them both, it was a genuine alternative with its own philosophical merit. For Berkeley could talk about God in the language of ideas with the same appropriateness, yet with precisely the same qualifications, as he used public language about himself. For so far as his own ' reflexive act ' was con cerned with ideas; so far was theology capable of intelligible expression; in so far as that ' act ' was more, the ' mystery ' and transcendence that theology demanded was made possible and the demands of devotion justified. So to the second problem and to perhaps the greatest difficulty that a Christian philosopher must face: what philosophical defence could Berkeley give of the distinctive claims of Christianity? As early as St. Paul's Sermon at Athens it had become clear that the transition from natural theology to revealed theology was exceedingly problematical. The Athenians showed an interested respect while Paul expounded a natural theology, but at the mention of the resurrection they mocked. This was too much to swallow from a University preacher. And in Berkeley's own time the difficulties had been heightened indeed. Just before Alciphron appeared, Tindal had produced (1730) ' Christianity as Old as the 22 Cp. Berkeley's own remark in, Works, vol. iii, p. 170.</page><page sequence="10">122 SERMON PREACHED AT FESTIVAL Creation or the Gospel a Republication of the Religion of NatureChristianity so ' reasonable ' that its only distinctiveness was to support the themes of a ' natural religion Christianity might claim, as was urged some ten years later, to supply ' free agents with new argu ments ' 23; it might claim to give new sanctions for old duties; but the resurrection was only an argument for immortality ' from eyesight \23 Can Berkeley do better justice to its traditional claims for distinctiveness? For many pages Alciphron does not give us any reason to think he can. The earlier dialogues (apart from the Fourth we have noticed) seem just to commend negatively and positively the Christian religion as no more than a ' principle of happiness and virtue It is true that enough water has flowed down the Liffey, not to say other rivers in West and East, to make us rather more sympathetic to this plea for the interpenetration of morality and religion than we might have been a few years ago. But even so we shall find no clue to the distinctiveness of Christianity here. Even Berkeley's discussion of the Scriptures, while for his own day advanced, defends them against various attacks only at the cost of stressing their similarities to other ancient writers. As for miracles, they are admittedly inexplicable; and will never be the foundation of faith, though they may be its ' object'. Where then is the distinctiveness of the Christian claim to be found? Here is the challenge par excellence. What is Berkeley's answer? We come to the last of the seven Dialogues, and we have not gone far in it before we find both the full measure of the problem and Berkeley's important answer to the crucial question it posits. The question and the answer alike concern ' Grace '. ' Grace is the main point in the Christian dispensation .... Christians are said to be heirs of grace, to receive grace, grow in grace, be strong in 23 A. A. Sykes, Principles and Connection of Natural and Revealed Religion (1740), pp. 100, 249.</page><page sequence="11">SERVICE IN TRINITY COLLEGE, DUBLIN. 123 grace, to stand in grace, and to fall from grace Christianity is styled the covenant or dispensation of grace. And it is well-known that no point hath created more controversy in the Church than this doctrine of grace. What disputes about its nature, extent, and effects, about universal, efficacious, sufficient, preventing, irresistible grace, have employed the pens of Protestant as well as Popish divines, of Jansenists and Molinists, of Lutherans, Calvinists, and Arminians, as I have not the least curiosity to know, so I need not say,' claims Alciphron.2i But only because there is to be a plague on them all. For ' what is the clear and distinct idea marked by the word graceVib None. Christian doctrine is meaningless. How does Berkeley deal with this problem? There is an important and significant omission from the Seventh Dialogue in the third edition. Originally Berkeley's main answer to the problem, which he gave in paragraphs five to seven, was in effect that ' grace ' worked like a general abstract idea: ' words become general by re presenting an indefinite number of particular ideas '26— that is a familiar story. But sometimes no particular idea turns up. There is a blank, and ' not finding particular ideas ',2' yet having no doubt some sort of ' hunch ' that there is a series of particulars round the corner, we suppose some ' abstract general idea ' even more curious than usual. So grace, while yielding a blank, might nevertheless have a sort of dispositional significance. Now such an argument after three sections, seems singularly negative and inadequate. Grace yields a blank; so sometimes do abstract ideas; yet this does not prevent them having some kind of factual reference to particular ideas—-so grace may have the same. Small wonder that Berkeley omitted these sections from his third edition. For firstly, by itself, the 24 Works, vol. iii, pp. 289, 290. 25 Works, vol. iii, p. 290. 26 Works, vol. iii, App. I, p. 335. 27 Works, vol. iii, App. I, p. 335.</page><page sequence="12">124 SERMON PREACHED AT FESTIVAL argument would imply that ' grace ' might after all be given an adequate ' public' analysis—a possibility which he has by implication rejected in section 4. Alciphron can gladly say ' Grace taken in the vulgar sense, either for beauty, or favour, I can easily understand \28 There is no difficulty here. Rather does the point at issue concern grace ' when it denotes an active, vital, ruling principle \29 And this, in the earlier editions is given but a brief, and subordinate treatment. So the unfortunate impression might arise, developed over three sections, that ' grace' was just like an}' abstract idea, and especially remembering our remarks at the start, the need for notions (which is really Berkeley's original and major point) might not be at all clear. Small wonder that Berkeley felt the original three paragraphs, with the emphasis their length gave, to be unsatisfactory and indeed compromising. So not surprisingly they are omitted from the 3rd edition and, when the original argument is summarised at the beginning of the present section 5, its original sections are greatly abbreviated and somewhat significantly modified. True, the example of counting, when numbers may miss ideas, is taken to show that perhaps grace might in some similar way refer to particular ideas, although not ' every time ' 30 should it excite the ideas it signifies. But this point (while in its way important and as far as it goes, necessary, to provide such idea-reference as theological language needs to have) soon disappears into the much more important one, viz., that such an example of numbering suggests that ' a discourse .... that directs how to act ' 31 may have an important significance even though the relation to ideas is problematical. Here is Berkeley on old, firm, familiar gound at last. ' Grace ' is not logically like ' number', but rather like ' numbering ' Grace ' being a construct from ' activity 28, 29 Worlcs, vol. iii, p. 280. 30 Works, vol. iii, p. 291. 31 Works, vol. iii, p. 292.</page><page sequence="13">SERVICE IN TRINITY COLLEGE, DUBLIN. 125 grace involving activity, is notionally given. The word ' grace ' like ' God ' is significant though its distinctive reference extends beyond ideas. The ' grace of God' —' God specially active '—as characterising the objective constituent of the self-other encounter, shares with ' I-active' the same odd logical status and empirical reference. Each phrase contains words which are ' sig nificant although they do not stand for ideas \32 Each phrase characterises such part of our self-other awareness as is not reducible altogether to idea-particulars. Berkeley might well have concluded that ' grace ' as a special charac terisation of ' activity ', will only be talked about in terms of ideas which exhibit even more logical impropriety than customarily belongs to talk about ' activity ' in any case —and perhaps miracles are precisely those odd event patterns which endeavour to do this. But that point we cannot develop now; we can only note that Berkeley consistently concludes with the view that Christian doctrines are associated with this special characterisation of the active encounter, precisely as the phrase ' God-active' characterises it in general—each and all of these phrases having some reference to particular ideas, but always denoting more than them; and always denoting this ' more ', therefore, in some mysterious fashion. Christians may ' be allowed to believe the divinity of our Saviour or that in Him God and man make one Person ' precisely in so far as such ' faith ' becomes a ' real principle of life and conduct \33 So again ' person ' when used of ourselves, has both the intelligibility and the mystery that belongs to Christian doctrine in general : neither less nor more. In a final broadening of vision, let us reflect that Berkeley properly gives the same logical placings to ' grace ' and to ' force '—both are constructs from ' activity Further, all genuinely significant words which do not relate to particular ideas, might likewise be found to demand 32 Works, vol. iii, p. 292. 33 Works, vol. iii, p. 298.</page><page sequence="14">126 SERMON PREACHED AT FESTIVAL analysis in terms of ' activityeven geometrical words, if we remember that relations involve an ' act of the mind '.34 Here is the possibility of Siris, though only framework it be, of a genuine ' chain of reflexions ', a comprehensive view, taking us from Tar Water to the Trinity—with language having at all times some reference, occasionally problematical, to particular ideas, yet at all times having reference also to that self-other activity— that odd empirical fact—which is at one and the same time that which confronts, and that which ultimately eludes, the philosopher. If it be true that ' in him we live and move and have our being it is also true to use another of Berkeley's favourite texts that ' great is the mystery of godliness.' (i Tim. iii, 16.) So we commemorate Berkeley for his originality, and for his penetrating vision, but also for his ultimate humility and his practical endeavours. Alciphron, you may remember, was written at Rhode Island when the Bermuda project delayed. So easily did Berkeley move between practical concerns and philosophical speculation and apologetic. The philosophy was the man; and the man his philosophy. As we commemorate the philosophical theologian, his concern for sound learning and his scientific abilities, so do we properly remember as well his missionary endeavours, his work for the economic betterment of this great country and nation, his pastoral care as Bishop of Cloyne. So our commemoration goes from America to the Continent; from Derry to Cloyne, but returns in the end to this place—to this College and to its Chapel, where Berkeley was ordained; to this House of learning and fellowship and faith, to those who inspired Berkeley and to those he himself has inspired since. For his work, and for theirs, we praise and thank God. Yet especially in a sermon must we needs acknowledge, at the same time, the weaknesses of us all, Berkeley 34 Works, vol. ii, p. 106.</page><page sequence="15">SERVICE IN TRINITY COLLEGE, DUBLIN. 127 included, which make us ever ' unprofitable servants. '35 But these our weaknesses, with all the unsatisfied wrestlings of our minds, and all the painful struggles of national aspiration, share their limitation with the language of ' ideas and are only to be fulfilled within that notional awareness which is the worshipful encountering of faith. As in God ' we live and move and have our being ', so do we ever return to God as that Fountain of living water, by whose grace and refreshing we ever find new visions and a new enabling, and at last that which springs up ' into eternal life.'36 36 Cp. John iv, 14 with Jer. ii, 13. 35 Cp. perhaps Berkeley's criticism of the First Earl of Shaftesbury.</page></plain_text>
