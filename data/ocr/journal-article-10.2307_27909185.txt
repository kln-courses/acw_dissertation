<plain_text><page sequence="1">THEOPHORIC PERSONAL NAMES IN ANCIENT HEBREW: A COMPARATIVE STUDY. By Jeaneane D. Fowler. JSOT Supplement Series 49. Pp. 410. Sheffield: JSOT, 1988. Cloth. The goal of this study is first to describe Hebrew personal names, both formally and semantically, and second to determine what concepts of God are revealed in these names and the degree to which those concepts may be distinct from those found in other Semitic onomastica (Ugaritic, Phoenician, Amorite, Aramaic, Old Akkadian, Akkadian, and Palmyrene onomastica are compared).The b?te noire here seems to be A. Caquot of the Coll?ge de France who has suggested that the "pi?t?" observable in Semitic personal names might reflect a "religiosit? s?mitique" (Syria 39 [1962]:256). The first part of the book is divided into major sections such as "nom inal sentence names," "verbal sentence names," "construct form names,"</page><page sequence="2">Hebrew Studies 31 (1990) 142 Reviews etc., with many sub-categories introduced only by full sentences (i.e., with out sub-headings). This format is to some extent endemic to the subject: there are hundreds of names, each slightly different from the other, and any discussion of them tends to be a sequence of individual remarks. But the format does leave the reader often feeling adrift on a sea of disparate data. I will leave the minutiae of the discussion on proper names to experts in onomastics, but will point out two rather minor details that deserve criti cism. One reflects a widely held position to which I have taken exception (see D. Pardee, UF 10 [1978]:249-288; Les textes para-mythologiques de la 24e campagne [Paris, 1988] p. 207, n. 30); the assertion that mrr means "strong" appears frequently with no mention of phonetic difficulties (e.g., merSySh showing no trace of the geminate root), nor of the comparative Semitic ones. At least a bibliographical reference would have been in order?at most a full-scale refutation of my position. The second detail shows a lack of familiarity with conventions used by some epigraphers: on p. 92 P. Bordreuil and A. Lemaire are accused of confusion for translit erating the proper name cSyhw with shin rather than with ?in. Since all of the West Semitic alphabets had only one graph for shin and ?in, many scholars use shin conventionally to transliterate that graph, whatever the underlying phoneme may be. When attempting a normalization, of course, most would transcribe according to the norms of Biblical Hebrew. The "confusion" is not, therefore, Bordreuil's and Lemaire's, but Fowler's. On the topic of Hebrew religion as revealed by the proper names, one finds what might charitably be termed a predisposition for monotheism. This is visible in at least three areas of the discussion. (1) Despite a section on non-Yahwistic theophoric elements (pp. 63-69), when one arrives at the conclusions in chap. 5, it is assumed that Hebrew religion was monotheistic. (2) There are significant omissions in the list of non-Yahwistic theophoric elements to which reference has just been made, for example, SimSon and ReSep. (3) The discussion of the common (and hence presumably theologi cally acceptable) theophoric elements (pp. 29-63) is almost purely formal with no probing of its problems, for example, the variant forms of YHWH (that name never appears as such in a personal name) nor of the status of the other terms (purely appellative, as Fowler seems to assume, or inde pendent deities?). It appears to me that Fowler has attributed "absurdity" to Caquot's po sition (p. 297) without paying close attention to Caquot's terminology: the latter's terms were "piety" and "religiosity," not "theology." Of the differ ences between Hebrew onomastics and those of her neighbors, the ones that</page><page sequence="3">Hebrew Studies 31 (1990) 143 Reviews are theologically significant show a strong tendency to monotheism with its various manifestations (e.g., the lack of references to feminine deities, the lack of divinized zoological terms, etc.). It would be difficult to believe that by the term "piety" Caquot was intending to portray Israelite religion as being polytheistic to the same extent as the religions of her neighbors. An examination of the phenomena to which Caquot refers shows that he was referring primarily to the ability of the deity to intervene on behalf of the worshipper. On peut r?sumer le contenu religieux des noms propres ?tudi?s en disant que le fid?le, porteur ou donneur du nom, se place sous la protection du dieu, qu'il attende de lui sa sauvegarde, ou qu'il le loue pour ses bienfaits. La religion qui se d?gage des noms propres est une religion personnelle. But even when comparing these aspects of religious belief to which Caquot was referring, Fowler considerably overstates her case. On p. 297 she asserts that "numerous anthropomorphic features" were absent from Palmyrene theophoric names, that the "idea [singular!] of salvation, mercy, compassion" was totally absent and that "transcendent concepts" were few. The second category is the easiest to refute because of the absoluteness of the formulation. As concerns mercy and compassion, one can point out the presence of at least brk "to bless," and of hnn "to favor, have compassion on." And it can only be claimed that "salvation" is absent if one limits the expression of that concept to verbs denoting "save" and omits the similar concepts of "protection," "preservation," and "strength" (to cite Fowler's categories that immediately precede "salvation" on pp. 286-289), concepts that are expressed in Palmyrene personal names. Surely it is not a major difference of "piety" to expect "protection" from one's deity rather than "salvation" (note Caquot's term "sauvegarde"). Of terms that Fowler clas sifies as denoting "transcendence," at least three are attested in Palmyrene proper names, cly "mount," rm "be high," and interrogatives of the type "Who is like DN?" (see her charts on pp. 266 and 293-94), all three com mon terms in West Semitic onomastics. It appears, therefore, that Fowler has partially misinterpreted Caquot's intention and misrepresented the data for refuting that part of his position that is properly subject to her criticism. The problem of monotheism in Hebrew personal names is not an easy one to solve. (See, for example, the quite differing results achieved by viewing the problem from different perspectives in the studies of J. Tigay, You Shall Have No Other Gods. Israelite Religion in the Light of Hebrew Inscriptions Harvard Semitic Studies 31 [Atlanta, 1986]; and D. Pardee,</page><page sequence="4">Hebrew Studies 31 (1990) 144 Reviews "An Evaluation of the Proper Names from Ebla from a West Semitic Perspective: Pantheon Distribution According to Genre," Eblaite Personal Names and Semitic Name-Giving. Papers of a Symposium Held in Rome July 15-17, 1985 Archivi Reali di Ebla, Studi, vol. 1 [Rome, 1988], pp. 119-151.) But a realization that the problem is not one of black-and white simplicity, a recognition that Hebrew religion had a history (i.e., an evolution), and a willingness to deal straightforwardly with the data are necessary prerequisites to undertaking the study.
