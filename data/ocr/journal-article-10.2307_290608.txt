<plain_text><page sequence="1">DIVINITY AND DELIBERATION. [Isocrates raises the question whether the gods deliberate, with prob- able reference to a discussion of such a problem in a lost Sophistic treatise. From his time on through ancient literature the discussion of this problem becomes a commonplace of philosophic and near-philosophic literature, marked by increasing complexity. The study of the growth of this topic and its relation to Aristotle, frag. 58, tends to cast suspicion upon the ascription of this fragment to Aristotle. The history of this department of Greek thought is at once subsidiary and comple- mentary to that of the theories of the ancients concerning the attributes of God and of the disembodied soul.] My purpose in this paper is not to discuss ancient philosophic theories concerning the nature or attributes of God in their entirety. I find in ancient Greek literature a topic of mixed literary and philosophic character concerned with the question whether a supreme Deity or a number of gods are ever engaged in, or have the faculty of, deliberation. Because epovXAa, good deliberation, is a virtue, or, as Aristotle puts it, the special function of the virtue prudence (4po'vtn), this literature some- times takes the form of a discussion of the attributes of God. With this larger question, however, I am concerned only in so far as it involves a consideration of the special topic, the delibera- tion or non-deliberation of God. It may be added that simple references to the plan of God, or the counsel of God, are gen- erally not taken into account here. Since, then, it is not my purpose to sketch the history of the refinement of the conception of Deity, there is no need to con- sider here the first evidences of such a refinement to be found in the antithesis of human and divine passion in Solon's expression of the doctrine of the late punishment of the wicked,' or Theognis' irreverent indictment of Zeus for dispensing the same fate to sinners and to just alike (vv. 373 if.). Nor need I pause for the physical and non-physical predications or identities of God to be found in the Presocratics. Whether or not we may conjecture with some probability concerning the presence or absence of the deliberative faculty in God in the theological metaphysics of a Xenophanes, or the same philosopher's polemic 225 1 Frag. 1, v. 17, Diehl.</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. against an anthropomorphic conception of divinity, or Hera- cleitus' designation of human wisdom as nothing other than the imitation of nature and of the Deity-is beside the point. The extant fragments of these philosophers reveal no preoccupation with such a problem. In extant Greek literature the man who first indicates its presence was not a philosopher, but one who clung to conven- tional Greek ethics and traditional Greek religion, and yet followed in a fashion after the foremost thought of his day. That man is Isocrates, who, trained in the schools of the Sophists, turns upon his teachers, now become his rivals, some- what the same type of eristic argument against which he seems to be protesting. His rivals, he says, promise more than they can accomplish. They, the teachers of eristic, promise their prospective students that they will, after consorting with them- selves, always know what to do on any particular occasion, and that they will become happy by means of this knowledge. Against such a claim Isocrates calls Homer to witness (Against the Sophists ? 2): oluLat yap aaraotv etvaL pavepov OTL Ta LEXXovra Trpoy7yvwTKatV ov T7r r/'LETcpa' fevareW c(Tl7, aXXa Troovov aTrexofev TavT7l)s Tr s ppoVfacESO, WfaO' O/Uyrpos 6 .7eyLaT7V C7rt ao&lt;ftla &amp;o[av eXrltwsF Kat Tovsg 0Eov'; 7reTroL7)KeV WTtV OT?

This passage clearly implies that Isocrates himself does not believe that divinity deliberates, and suggests besides that per- haps Homer did not believe so, but meant simply to teach the lesson that man must deliberate since he has not foresight. And, though it is latent, we may find here the further thought that God, since He has foresight, does not deliberate. The warning may be added, however, that Isocrates is unconscious of the metaphysical implications with which the question is charged. Elsewhere, for example, he ascribes the virtues to God (xi. 41). He presses Homer into service after the uncritical fashion of the day against which Plato in the Protagoras (347 E) protested. His attention, however, is concentrated upon his favorite point that there can be no science of the contingent (cf., e. g., On the Peace ? 8), and that the virtue of his own "philosophy" is that it does not pretend to offer such a science, but aims rather at 226</page><page sequence="3">DIVINITY AND DELIBERATION. inculcating such a degree of intelligence in its devotees that they will be able by conjecture to arrive at sane judgments.2 Xenophon's Memorabilia, appearing within a year or two of Isocrates' Against the Sophists, contains two verbal suggestions of God's deliberation. At i. 4. 7 Socrates speaks of "One who planned that there be living creatures," fOLKE irXajpvqj rt TLVOS tja JEVau ovAXcvoau'vov, where the reference is entirely teleological. The other passage consists of a reference to the advice of the gods to be received from oracles (iv. 7. 10), and is indicative solely of Socrates' pious attachment to normal Greek religion. Plato's interest in the nature of the Godhead is primarily directed to purging the conception of God of attributes, passions, and thaumaturgic faculties unworthy of a supreme and perfect Being. In his certainly genuine dialogues it is only in the Timaeus that he may even be thought to have made any infer- ences about the divine intelligence. Here (30B) he tells us that by a process of reasoning God, or the Good Artisan, found out that no senseless thing was better than one possessed of sense. The word for "reasoning" here, Xoyta,uevos (cf. AoytrpoA here and at 34A) is the nearest approach to a suggestion of delibera- tion in the passage. However, nothing can be inferred concern- ing Plato's notion of the mental processes of the divinity from the use of this word. In the possibly Platonic Epinomis there is a paragraph which, like the passage in the Timaeus, approaches, but does not really touch, the problem. Of the two types of bodies in the universe, those possessed of fire, the stars, move in perfect order, and must therefore be intelligent and possessed of soul (982 AB). The plan or decision reached by pure soul when it takes the best counsel in accordance with the highest reason (982 B, Orav ?v X T aptTarov KaTa TOV aptLOTOV pov eovcTatrl vovv), is unalterable. " The three fates really take hold of this and watch to see that that which has been decided with the best deliberation by each of the gods is perfect ( .. ,X. OV elvai TO ,eATXrT' T-ovXA 3E?ovXcvpt'vov . .)." The fact that the stars always do the same thing is not, as most men have supposed, evidence that they have not souls, but certain evidence that they have souls. They do the same things because they decided upon them a wondrously long time 2 Cf. xv. 271, xii. 30, xiii. 7-8. 227</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. ago. They are not given to changing their minds (ov uCTa- povXvotfLevov avw Kat KCa7T). The majority of mankind err in supposing that mutability is evidence of soul and that stability is evidence against the possession of soul. In this passage only the language suggests deliberation as men know it. Pure soul decides faultlessly, and has but one course to consider and that the perfect course. Perfect deliberation is thus deliberation in a Pickwickian sense: all the steps are omitted save the last one, and there is only one last one. This passage of the Epinomis yields, therefore, no more than the Timaeus passage on the question whether God deliberates or not. It is perhaps idle to conjecture whether Plato ever felt con- scious of such a question. His works certainly do not reveal any such awareness of it, even if we suppose the Epinomis his. The Pickwickian deliberation of the stars in the Epinomis and the reflection of the Good Artisan in the Timaeus are both but ways of saying that the stars and the divinities are intelligent. They shed no light upon their author's conception of the nature of the divine intelligence. Yet the absence of such an expres- sion of the problem in Plato's works is no evidence against its having been considered by his contemporaries. Plato's con- temporaries, or immediate predecessors, as they appear in his dialogues, are idealized characters who, it has been pointed out,3 give perhaps better statements of their theories than their prototypes, the real Sophists and philosophers, could ever have given. If we suppose that the problem was discussed by one of the Sophists or Presocratics, if, for example, we can imagine its presence in such a treatise as Protagoras' IIlpl ?c5v, it becomes easier to understand Isocrates' reference to it. Further, since in all probability, such a sophistic treatment of the deliberation of God would tend towards a sceptical conclusion and would rest in great part upon an anthropomorphic concep- tion of God, Plato's silence upon this minor aspect of a tendency which he combatted as a whole would be expected. If it is difficult to imagine that Isocrates, alone and unaided, might have come upon a problem involving so many metaphysi- cal problems, it is not quite so necessary to suppose a previous interest in the question caused Aristotle to take it up seriously. 8 Cf. Shorey, What Plato Said, pp. 124, 141, 273, etc. 228</page><page sequence="5">DIVINITY AND DELIBERATION. For Aristotle was preoccupied with the problems of deliberation in toto to a much greater extent than was Plato. EivfovAXa is for Plato a virtue, but it is related loosely to aoola, since, says Plato, the man who deliberates well upon any subject is the man who is wise or well-informed in that particular field.4 But Aristotle, classifying and lending technical significance to the virtues, finds ev/ovXia to be the special work of the virtue of practical wisdom, ppov-oyas. And practical wisdom is itself inferior and subsidiary to theoretic wisdom, aoqoa. Aristotle secures the contingency of particular future events by denying the applicability of the rule of excluded middle to propositions stated with the modality of the necessary concerning such future events (De Interp. 18 b 31 ff.). Such future events, then, con- stitute the field of imaginative action (De Anima 434 a 7) for the deliberator, who is concerned not with the end, says Aris- totle, correcting Plato (Laches 185 D), for the end is the real or apparent good, but with the means to that end.5 The delibera- tor and the adviser are efficient causes in the field of contingent events, events which are in our power, iq' zucv (De Interp. 19 a 7 f., Phys. 194 b 30, and Met. 1013 a 31). Again, in a passage in the Physics (199 b 26-33) of great importance for later Greek thought, Aristotle, arguing for a teleological purposiveness or final cause in nature, in opposition to Empedocles' doctrine to the effect that the equipment of existing species of animals is the result of natural selection, or the survival of the fittest, says: arolrov So TO tl?1 otEcaOaL EOVEKa TV yIvET -Oa, EaV loa TO KOVO V f3ovXvfrad,cvov. Aristotle proceeds to point out that art doesn't deliberate either. If the art of shipbuilding were innate in wood, it would create the ship in the manner in which nature works; so that, if a final cause is in art, it is also in nature. The example Aristotle chooses, of the physician who treats him- self, to illustrate the manner in which nature works, probably suggested to Plotinus his somewhat better use of a similar figure from medicine (infra).

I, p. 77 b; and James Sully, Outlines of Psychology (New York: 1886), pp. 643 ff. 229</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. Latent in this passage of the Physics is the point that delibera- tion is causative in an efficient manner, as are not art or nature. And elsewhere Aristotle carefully distinguishes deliberation from nature and art (cf. e.g., EN 1112 a 31ff.). Barring the contrary evidence of a few passages 6 Aristotle's teleology is the unconscious teleology of nature, not the purposive action of God. But whether Aristotle's God be conceived to be both a final cause and an efficient cause, or the former only, or neither, the causation of the Unmoved Mover is certainly not of a deliberative nature. Aristotle might have availed himself of this line of argu- ment to prove that God does not deliberate. His commentators do. But he himself touches upon the problem only indirectly, and in connection with his doctrine of virtue and happiness. Aristotle notes in passing (EN 1145 a 22 if.) that as vice can- not be ascribed to a brute, so virtue cannot be ascribed to God. And at almost the very end of the Nicomachean Ethics, as proof of the proposition that the most complete happiness is not in the practical virtues, but in theoretic activity or contemplation, Aristotle offers the following argument (EN 1178 b 8 ff.): The gods are considered especially blessed and happy. But supposing actions (7rpa'eLs) to be the most complete sort of hap- piness, what sort of actions may we assign to the gods? Not just actions, for the gods will appear ridiculous if they enter into contracts with each other or return deposits, etc. Not brave actions, as if the gods abode fearful things and ran risks. Not liberal actions, for the gods, having no currency or any- thing like that, have nought to give. Not temperate actions: it would be a low kind of praise, inasmuch as the gods have no base desires. So too with all the other kinds of actions-all would be found petty and unworthy of them. Yet all suppose that the gods do live and function-they don't sleep like Endy- mion. But the only function left a living being when moral actions and production are taken away, is contemplation. Thus Aristotle denies 0pOvcqis, and with it efi3ovta, to the gods.

I cli, and, for the " causation " of God, ibid., p. cxxxiv. 230</page><page sequence="7">DIVINITY AND DELIBERATION. Iamblichus' Protrepticus has been generally observed by scholars. The fragment of Cicero is preserved in Augustine's De Trinitate iv. 9, under the chapter-heading: An justitia et ceterae virtutes desinunt in futura vita. Briefly, it is to the effect that if there be an immortal life awaiting us in the Isles of the Blessed, we should there have no need of eloquence, since there would be no judicial proceedings, nor should we need even the virtues them- selves. What follows is closely parallel to the passage in the Nicomachean Ethics (see Rose, Arist. frag. 58): nec enim forti- tudine egeremus nullo proposito aut labore aut periculo, nec iustitia cum esset nihil quod adpeteretur alieni, nec temperantia quae regeret eas quae nullae essent libidines. ne prudentia quidem egeremus nullo delectu proposito bonorum et malorum. una igitur essemus beati cognitione naturae et scientia, qua sola etiam deorum est vita laudanda. On the statement of Trebellius Pollio,7 together with the parallelism in thought to EN X, Bernays 8 was convinced that this was a fragment of Aristotle's early dialogue, the Protrepticus. Bywater o presented in parallel columns the fragment and the passage from Iamblichus' Pro- trepticus (ch. 9), which I quote in part: . . .

Bywater, urging an Aristotelian source for much of Iamblichus' Protrepticus, finds in the greater fullness of Cicero's version evidence that the "rhetorical instinct of the Latin writer has led him to amplify the original, and in the process miss some portion of the sense." But Bywater's sup- port of this line of argument is unconvincing. Rudolf Hirzel,?1 objecting to Bywater's theory that Iamblichus made free use of Aristotle's Protrepticus, finds instead that a number of works of both Plato and Aristotle have been used in the Protrepticus of Iamblichus. Jaeger, interested as he is in discovering the content of the Protrepticus of Aristotle, and in establishing his series, Philebus - Eudemian Ethics - Protrepticus- Nicomachean 7 Vita Salonini Gallieni, 2, in Script.

Ethics, finds later influence in the Protrepticus of Iamblichus, but assigns somewhat more of it to Aristotle's Protrepticusw. Space does not permit a consideration here of the problem in toto.2 But several uncertainties may be noted: (1) The evi- dence of Trebellius Pollio for the theory that Cicero's Hor- tensius was modelled after the Protrepticus of Aristotle is slender. Pollio's statement, ". . . M. Tullius in Hortensio, quem ad exemplum protreptici scripsit," may mean simply that it was cast in the form or after the model of a protreptic dis- course.13 (2) Even if Pollio's reference be thought conclusive evidence in favor of the indebtedness of Cicero's Hortensius to Aristotle, it does not follow that this particular passage comes from Aristotle. (3) The similarity of the passage in Iamblichus' Protrepticus does not settle the question, inasmuch as both writers may be using a common source later than Aristotle.4 (4) The resemblance in thought between the deliberation-after- death passage and NE X is of such a nature as to indicate the precedence of the latter. The passage immediately preceding our excerpt in Iamblichus' Protrepticus bears some resemblance to an argument to be found, among other places, in the first book of the Nicomachean Ethics. Iamblichus repeats Aristotle's reasoning to the effect that there is not an endless chain of "goods," but there must be an apX, a first "good" sought for itself.15 It is thus that Iamblichus introduces the Isles-of-the-Blest passage. It is true that Aris- totle speaks of the life of those in the Isles of the Blessed in the Politics (1334 a 31); and he there assigns to them not only ioao&lt;ot'a, but oawPpoorvvr and 8tKatocvrq. But he is not there Jaeger, Aristoteles, pp. 60 ff. 12 Besides the literature noted, cf. H. G.

Iamblichus, however, is endeavor- ing to be more exact. In the Isles of the Blest the only useful virtues will be rT &amp;avodcOLat KaU OewpeLv. But by a strange misuse of the argument preceding this passage Iamblichus will have us continue to admire the virtue 4po'vr(as, the more so since in that world it will be useless-and therefore not desirable for the sake of something higher, but for itself. This involves a fallacy: The "uselessness" of the highest virtue in the hierarchy of virtues is confused with real uselessness. Through this confu- sion arises the usurping by fp6vrcrtS of the place of Oewpta, or rather the utter confusion of them in the phrase, 7 OEcopnTtK fpo'v1-Lts (Pistelli 54. 11-12), a confusion which, however, is natural for Iamblichus because of the Neoplatonic sense in which he generally uses the word.l6 Plato represents the soul of the sage and philosopher as spending its time gazing at abstract ideas, of which one, to be sure, would be po?'vqao-, though, as it happens, po'vqtL is not in the list given (Phaedrus 247 C D). And the Neoplatonist, Iamblichus, may have this passage of Plato in mind. But to adduce the broader use of opovr-CLS in Plato and Aristotle 17 to support an Aristotelian source for the use of it in the context about the Isles-of-the-Blest passage would be to forget that the prudentia of the Hortensius fragment and the (po'vrlatL of Iamblichus which will not be "useful" after death are the technical &gt;podvr-qc of EN X, and that the confusion introduced by Iamblichus is a real confusion, dependent in part upon the Neoplatonic division of virtues into terrestrial and celestial, and in part upon the special sense which Iamblichus himself gives the word. If, then, the Isles-of-the-Blest passages of Cicero and of Iamblichus are to be traced to Aristotle's Pro- trepticus, we must suppose that Aristotle had already given 10 For the meaning of fp6ov?7rs in Iamblichus' Protrepticus cf.

But the striking similarity of the argu- ment to that of EN X, the fact that, as I shall show in the course of this paper, the discussion of the virtues of God and of the disembodied soul constitute a philosophic topic that might appear at any time after Aristotle, or at latest, after Carneades; the possibility that both Cicero and Iamblichus may be using a common source, perhaps, but a late source; render the ascription of the Isles-of-the-Blest fragment to Aristotle's Protrepticus a conjecture deserving consideration, but by no means a certainty. If, however, the passages of Cicero and lamblichus must be traced to Aristotle, then it is more reason- able, I believe, to find in them an attempt to treat as one the untechnical reference to the Isles of the Blest in the Politics (1334 a 31) and the technical study of the virtues of the gods in EN X. It is not quite certain to what use Cicero put his Isles-of-the- Blest passage. Augustine's use of it is somewhat like that of Iamblichus, but suggests rather Thomas Aquinas' discussion of the attributes of God.18 Augustine says (loc. cit.): Fortassis et aliae tres virtutes, prudentia sine ullo jam periculo erroris, forti- tudo sine molestia tolerandorum malorum, temperantia sine repugnatione libidinum, erunt in illa felicitate. Thus the souls may possess all the virtues, but in a Pickwickian sense. To return to the main line of tradition, the Stoics took over from Aristotle the virtues of ppo'vrmlt and evp3ovAXa unchanged.l9 But the details with respect to the place of deliberation in the Stoic system offer much difficulty. The faculties of deliberation and reflection are in the heart (Von Arnim II 228. 4 if.); and the heart is the 6yEAoviLKOV e'popS r? i?vx&amp;s (Diels, Dox. p. 400). God is the yEyqovLdov or leading principle of the universe, and His functions correspond to those of the leading principle of man (Von Arnim II 186. 8 ff.). As the virtues are in the lead- ing principle of man, so must they be in the leading principle of 18 Cf., e.g., Summa Contra Gentiles I xcii-xciv and Mayor's note on Cicero ND iii. 38.

The Stoics abandoned Aristotle's hierarchy of virtues, however. Zeno is said to have referred all virtue to povroats. Cf. Von Arnim I 49. 234</page><page sequence="11">DIVINITY AND DELIBERATION. the universe, God. Cicero summarizes the Stoic position on this point as follows (ND ii 79 = Von Arnim II 327. 12 ff.): Cumque sint in nobis consilium, ratio, prudentia, necesse est deos haec ipsa habere maiora, nec habere solum, sed etiam iis uti in maxumis et optumis rebus. Thus the Stoics' God has all the virtues; He deliberates. But if the question be asked, how does God deliberate? the answer must be: as man deliberates, only more perfectly. And here lies one of the great Stoic paradoxes: How can there be any deliberation in a system which upholds a doctrine of necessity? Chrysippus affirmed, contrary to Aristotle's denial (De Interp. 18 b 31 and supra), the applicability of the rule of excluded middle to statements concerning future events. All judgments, he said, are either true or false, whence it follows that judg- ments concerning future events are true only if the events must happen of necessity, or false only if they affirm the impossible (Zeller4 III i 164). This position alone should have made deliberation for man impossible, as Aristotle had argued in the De Interpretatione, and as the Peripatetic school never wearied of repeating.20 It is beyond the scope of this paper to consider the Stoics' ingenious circumvention of this difficulty. Suffice it to observe that they did insist on the moral responsibility of man, who, they said, was free to obey or disobey his ruling principle.21 With reference to the deliberation of God, the difficulties are even greater. God, as the ruling principle of the world, takes counsel concerning all things, and at the same time foresees all things (Cic. ND ii 164). His perfection presumes His provi- dential government. His counsel, said Chrysippus, putting to a new use Homer's ALo5 . . P. ovX\,22 is necessity or fate. It may be said in defense of this paradox of the Stoics that they did not in all probability see it clearly. When they spoke of the deliberation of God, they were not so much concerned with the possibility of God's possessing such a faculty, as they were primarily with the symmetry of their system, their demand for a complete correspondence in the relation of man and world 20 Cf., e. g., Alex. Aphr. De Fato, Supplem. Arist. (Berlin) II ii 178. 21 See Hicks, Stoic and Epicurean, p. 104, and Zeller' III i 169 ff. 22 Plut.

Against this position, they insisted that God did plan, deliberate, and care for mortals. They were much concerned with the question whether God's care was directed to the individual, or reached the individual only through His care for the universe. In this connection, a passage of Marcus Aure- lius is instructive (vi. 44): Etl ive v orv /3ovXevaTavTO 7rep uov Kat TniV 4,OC auvj/3ifvaL oeLEXo'vrwv ol OC0, KaXwZs Eov/ovXco;avTo- a/ovXov yap Oeov oV8e E7rtvorjaat pasov' . .

In this passage are to be found two Stoic positions concerning the deliberation of God, the Peripatetic, and, finally, the Epicurean positions. But none of these is con- sidered critically. Nor is there here any implication as to the nature of the deliberation or planning of the gods. Although the question, " Do the gods deliberate?" is implied in Isocrates' use of it to prove that men must deliberate, in Aristotle's assignment of the contemplative virtues alone to the gods, and in Chrysippus' definition of God as wravaperos, it is found explicit and considered on its own merits for the first time by the Sceptic, Carneades of Cyrene. Carneades, himself a student of Chrysippus through the latter's successor, Diogenes of Babylonia,23 acknowledged his indebtedness to his master, but set himself to the task of overthrowing Stoic doctrine on a large scale. It is only with a detail in this larger attack that I am concerned here: one phase of the attack on the Stoic concep- tion of God. This attack is directed against the Stoic ascription of the virtues to God. Carneades considers the virtues as a whole and singly. His attack in this particular has many points in common with the passage cited in Aristotle; 24 but Carneades treats the problem much more extensively. He has the point, for example, that virtue is above its possessor (Sext. Emp. adv. 23 Cf. Hicks, op. cit., pp. 322 f. 2 EN 1178 b 7 ff. Cf. Sext.

In the case of each virtue, Carneades arrives by a sorites at the conclusion that God cannot exist at all. Part of his study of 4po'v-uaL in this connection may be quoted (loc. cit., ?? 167-170): eTrep TE wravapETrv cOrT TO OEdov Kat TfV fpOV7TLV EXEt,26 X,L Kat v e?VovAlav, 7rapoov ei povXla fpo'vr-qa ETL T 7rp TIL f3ovevTa. 27 el 8 rqv fp3ovXlav eXet, Kal /ovXeV'Tra. el oe 3ov0v?veTat, CaTL Tt adr&amp;Aov aZu). 8 et yap L)j8E)V imTLV ao7fov aVT,w ov /3oveveETaL ov;Se 7)v evf8ovXiav eXeI To TVV pfovX7v ao7AXov TIVOS eXc0aLT, 7T7rarTv ovcav rEpt TOV 7Tr( Ev TOlZ 7rapOVotv Op90d Leayo/yv.29 aTo7TOv SE yE OT TO 7 f ovXEvcrOaL LrfSE E Vov'lav EXELV TOV 0ov.30 TOtVVV vXEl TaVT7r , KaL TTrI Tl L8riXov avTro. el Se arT Tc drnXkov 6w, o aK d'\o ,ev Tl WTLV dr\7ov OV), ovX o SE Ka' TO TOlOVTOV OoiV el O C f , -g,ris 8- 8. o`V T aT a VX r (TtL Tila avTov isv r arelpta ( OapTLKau. aAA 'e TOVTOk C aV a8dr-qov avTw, 7ravT(s KaTa T7V TrpovooKiav TC V &gt;OapT7lKTWV aVTOV TOVTWVY, 'e 5VY ev crvvOpoi)nIE TLVh KLat KV Tl aTvi yevrcreTat, Kav 4OoOIrTO. el St (V KLV/laC,T7&amp; TOLOVTw yLveTaio Kal T (ir TO XIEpOV eTaPrOX A euTatlS SeKTiKOs, 8ia SOe TOUTo Kalt 6apTro'.

It may be taken as a repetition of the point that God is all-virtuous, and therefore must deliberate, or as an unctious remark similar to Marcus Aurelius' apovXov yyap 6Oebo ov0e e7rLvo7iTaLt p5L6ov (vi. 44 and supra); or it may anticipate the subse- quent sections in which are given the Sceptic " proof " that God cannot be conceived to exist if e has not the virtues (S. E. math. ix 171 ff.). - The text is Mutschmann's. I translate: " Therefore He has 'good counsel,' and there is something obscure to Him. If that be the case, then surely, if anything, some such thing as this must be obscure to Him, whether in the infinitude of things there be not some that are destructive of Himself. But if this latter be obscure to Him, he will then be afraid, especially when He is looking forward to the arrival of forces destructive of Himself, a state of mind which will cast Him into perplexity and emotion. But if He admit the emotion of fright, He will then be capable of a change for the worse, and will, therefore, be destructible. Whence it follows that He doesn't exist at all." 237</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. This passage turns largely on the proposition that there can be no contingent for an all-knowing, all-foreseeing Being. If we admit that anything may be obscure or contingent for Him, our conception of His perfection and everlastingness breaks down, as everything becomes contingent for Him, including His own future. Aristotle's God, on the other hand, is unaffected by, and unconcerned with, the element of contingency pervading the universe. Cicero in his De Natura Deorum, iii 38 ff., summarizes the more lengthy treatment to be found in Sextus Empiricus. The fact that Cicero was acquainted with the Academic argument against the ascription of the virtues to God, ought perhaps to be brought into relation with the fragment of the Hortensius discussed above. At any rate, the presence of an argument so similar in form in something less than a year later than the date of composition of the Hortensius may be thought to indi- cate Cicero's familiarity with it, and so to weaken the case for his having taken it directly from the Protrepticus of Aristotle. We have seen how Marcus Aurelius treated the problem. Not much more penetrating is the discussion to be found in the Middle Platonist, Maximus of Tyre, in his essay: -rives a,ELvov 7r9ep2 Oev 8tdXa/3ov, rotraTl t At,6o'oooco (IV). The essay is an endeavor to reconcile the accounts of the gods given by poets and philosophers, and may in the main be representative of a type of rhetorical polemic against Epicurus, otherwise exempli- fied in the Oert OewprqTLKtr described and illustrated by the rhetori- cian, Theon of Alexandria,32 whose OeTrt, el 7rpovooova Ocol rov Kocrov, resembles Maximus' essay in several details. I am con- cerned here with only the last section of Maximus' essay, chapter ix (Hobein, pp. 50 f.). Having enumerated the Stoic interpre- tations of divine names,33 by way of bringing into relation with each other the myths of poets and the doctrines of philosophers, Maximus breaks off suddenly with the question: "To what myth shall I liken the works of Epicurus?" Maximus then quotes with obvious contempt the first of Epicurus' KvpLaL SoGaL 32 Cf. Hermann Throm, "Die Thesis " in Rhetorische Studien, 17. Heft (1932), pp. 78f. 8S Zeus = vo6s; Athene = fop6vrjas; Apollo t- 'jX\os; Poseidon i 7rvevga. Cf. Hobein's notes, p. 50. 238</page><page sequence="15">DIVINITY AND DELIBERATION. (Usener, 71), and proceeds to declaim: "How can I imagine that Zeus? Doing what? Deliberating about what? Enjoying what sort of pleasure? Homer's Zeus drinks, but he also makes public speeches, and deliberates, etc." Finally, the inevitable Sardanapallus is adduced to illustrate the point that even the most licentious of mortal lords deliberates in behalf of his subjects. But the eclectic, Maximus of Tyre, is out of the main line of tradition in many respects. In an essay entitled El /kavTKKr? O5V,% (rOTLV TtL &amp;' ltjv, he says (XIII. ii, Hobein, p. 159): @eov u8 LavaTe a Kav avOpW7rwv vo . . XpluZa oavyyeveK% Kat et'rep rTL XXo dAX O,/oOLOv, ov8e a Elv aaV qr/ /uETpCaprpoEv Tpers avOpowr'TvrS yv /qf OEov. And again he says (XIII. ii. d): OTe TO Odov v7rvTwv evaroXov, OGTE TO av7p,TLvov Tadv7Tv T aToXov. Thus by denying to God infal- libility, Maximus escapes some of the logical difficulty involved in ascribing deliberation to Him. Similarly directed against Epicurus is the much later discus- sion in the little treatise entitled IIEpt Oe&amp;v Kal Kx'cr,ov, now gen- erally attributed to one Sallustius (c. 360 A. D.), and recently edited by A. D. Nock. Chapter Nine of this treatise, after an argument for design based on such minor details as that the eyes are transparent, proceeds: " We must suppose that the gods expend such care concerning the universe not with deliberation or toil, but just as bodies having a certain function do what they do merely by being, as, for example, the sun, which lights and warms by virtue solely of its being; so in much greater degree does the providence of the gods, without any effort on its part, work for the benefit of those on whom it is spent; so that the questions posed by the Epicureans are solved, etc." 34 A full discussion of the position in Neoplatonic or later Peripatetic philosophy of the problem of the presence or absence of deliberation in God, and an account of the influence of this philosophy upon scholastic thought, would carry the present study far beyond the limits set by space and its natural bounds. Let it suffice, then, to confine our observations in this instance to representative passages whose very content is indubitably concerned with the deliberation of God. For Plotinus, for exam- 84 Mr. Nock in his notes here aptly compares pseudo-Arist. De Mundo 397 b 22. 239</page><page sequence="16">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. pie, the attributes of God are a problem of major concern. Accepting Plato's 6qolotwLm Oeo (Theaet. 176B), Plotinus admits the further necessity of ascribing virtue to God (Enn. I ii 3). So too the disembodied soul, become like to God, will possess the virtues. But the details of this solution, the definition of the virtues as purificatory habits35 imitative of the purity which is the nature of God, need not concern us here. Again, Plotinus is interested in the question whether God has free will or not,36 but he does not here raise the question whether He may deliberate. This latter question Plotinus raises only in the connection in which it is found in Aristotle's Physics (199 b 26 ff.; cf. supra), and in language that would indicate he had Aristotle's reference to the subject in mind. Plotinus is discussing the nature of the third of his "trinity," the Soul, which, itself created by Mind which was created by the One, produces all other existences. He then asks the question concerning the manner in which the Soul, the principle of life in the universe, operates (IV iv 10): e OVV KaL avr L v T( Xoyitco0OatL Xee TO 7rV, ' /i S' Ev TO /rTELv O T7 Set rotdv. Going on to explain that no such process of calcula- tion or seeking what ought to be done is involved in creative activity of Soul, Plotinus defines production by Soul as the act of an E&amp;prpT7uvr)Vs LVvovT7s cftpov7ptiW y 7,s CtKoY 1 cv avTrj T c's. Here it is to be observed that &lt;powvwl is not prudence in the Aristo- telian sense, but yet the nearest equivalent that Plotinus' Soul may have. It is operative with respect to o rt 8d Irodiv, but not in a deliberative sense. It is the ever-abiding wisdom which dwells in Soul, and the order in Soul is the image of this wisdom. Soul, being a mirror for this wisdom, Plotinus tells us, cannot change any more than can the wisdom: it cannot doubt, nor hesitate. The chapter concludes with the sentence: el 8e AXXo Kal aXXo f3ovXVotTro, 7roOev TO aXXo; E'O' ? Tt XP7 ' irotdv a7rop'o,JEL, Kal acOevr)'UTEL TO bpyov avfl els apfqlt30oAov rTOv rpaTTev ev XoyLTa/LOts iovar1. Thus, to suppose that Soul is capable of any- thing in the nature of a deliberative process would be to break down our conception of the perfection of its production. 36 So Plato at Phaedo 69C. Cf.

Besides the passage in the Physics in which Aristotle says that Nature, though seeming to deliberate, doesn't really do so (199 b 26 ff.)-where, however, Aristotle's illustra- tion of the working of nature by the figure of the physician who heals himself is inferior to Plotinus' illustration-Plotinus may also recall here Aristotle's use of the physician to illustrate that it is the means, not the end, which is the subject of deliberation (EN 1112 b 12 ff.). Of the Aristotelian commentators, Alexander of Aphrodisias and the much later Philoponus interest themselves in our prob- lem. The former discusses it in the "Prooemium" to his Commentary on the Analytica Priora (Comm. in Arist. Graec. II i 5. 20 ff.). Alexander adds little to previous discussions, but his treatment is notable for the manner in which the several approaches to the subject are brought together. He begins with the point (Arist. EN X) that the only virtue which may be ascribed to the gods is owpa, or contemplative virtue. The other virtues cannot be predicated of the gods, he continues, because they are concerned with rwad), being regulatory of pas- sive experience, and controlling it, whereas the deity has no such experience.37 Alexander's second approach avails itself of Aris- totle's definition of choice or purpose as deliberative appetition (EN vi 1139 a 23). Deliberation, he proceeds, is concerned with matters in which we have free will, but whose issue is un- certain (EN iii 1113 a 10 f.). If then, the issue of nothing in the number of things that become through the agency of the '7 Aristotle does not in EN X (1178 b 8ff.) speak of the 7ra607 in connection with the virtues. But cf. EN 1105 b 20 ff., and De Anima 429 a 7 with Hicks's note. Cf. also Chalcidius, Platonis Tim. Comm., ch. cxxxv, ed.

Aphr., loc. cit., lines 30 f.). They have not therefore deliberation, nor choice, nor any virtue to correspond with choice. There is nothing in this treatment foreign to Aristotle's thought, although, as we have seen, Aristotle does not in his extant works, approach the problem so explicitly. Joannes Philoponus, writing some three centuries after Alexander of Aphrodisias, discusses the possibility of God's deliberating in two of his commentaries. Unlike that of Alex- ander, his discussion offers a peculiar mixture of traditions. His fuller treatment is to be found in his Commentary on the Categories of Aristotle (Comm. in Arist. Graec. XIII i. 145. 26 ff.). Philoponus has been discussing the relation of the will of God to the ability of God (loc. cit., lines 14 ff.). God's power is on a parity with His will: r `vLEro 70t OELOV -vvpotov EXeC r fovXrarL Trr Svvautv. To suppose that God wills what He cannot do is to suppose God foolish, as is a man who wishes to fly or to be deathless.38 To suppose God able to do what He does not will to do, is to suppose Him to possess power in vain.39 Philo- ponus then, fearing his reader will confuse flov'ArLs with flovX?', says: f3ovX7&lt;rtyv 8E XMyojuv 0 vraiv6a 'o OEAXr'ua, ov rO /fovXevecOat v rTv f3ovXrv.

But it just happens that this passage in the Nicomachean Ethics is part of a discussion whose purpose is to 38 Cf. Arist. EN 1111 b 20 ff. 39 This argument is a commonplace of Christian and later Greek thought, and in fact is to be found in Sextus Empiricus, where it is attributed by Pasquali to Epicurus. See Sext. Emp.

The sentence to which Busse refers distinguishes fiovXEA,eaOaL from t5lTiLv: to deliberate is to seek something. Now, in the sense that the deliberative process involves the finding out of something which we did not know, and in so far as opovrats is the virtue mani- fested in good deliberation, we may be said to require 4po'vrnLs, to be in need of it in order to discover the right course of action in any particular instance. But since the virtue of ef/3ovXia, and so of 0po'vswt, is a habit, and not any particular instance of the habit (Arist. EN 1140 a 24 ff.), we will possess it before each particular deliberation as well as after. Certainly, then, Aris- totle does not mean here, nor can I discover that he says any- where, that deliberation is nothing other than a lack of povv,raLt. We have seen that the conception of povSals did undergo great modifications from the time of Aristotle through Neoplatonism. And it has been conjectured that Philoponus depended largely upon other commentaries on Aristotle in the composition of his own.41 He was, moreover, a student of Neoplatonism.42 He may then easily have found such a use of po'vro-at in somewhat earlier commentaries, or he may himself in the endeavor to reconcile the use of the word which he found in Aristotle, and the use which we have seen in Plotinus and in Iamblichus' Protrepticus, have arrived at some such a definition of it as that he presents here. For in the context in which he uses it, Ipo'vrtas can only mean universal and intuitive wisdom or fore- sight. But that Philoponus is hopelessly confused in his understand- ing of Aristotle's special use of c/povv7avL is made more evident by his commentary upon Arist. Physics 199 b 26 ff.48 I translate: "Finally, he [Aristotle] sets down the reason why men are moved to suppose that nature has no final cause. It is probably, he says, because they do not see nature deliberating in its acts of creation that they deny to nature a final cause, as if indeed things that work with a final cause must always deliberate. But that, he says, would be ridiculous. For they ought to see at the 41 Cf. Kroll, Pauly-Wissowa, s. v. "Ioannes," no. 21, columns 1773-75. 42 Ibid., col. 1789. "8 Philop. in Phys., in Comm. in Arist. Graec. XVI 320. 28 to 321. 20. 243</page><page sequence="20">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. same time that the arts don't deliberate either." So far, Philo- ponus is following the passage in the Physics faithfully. He proceeds: " For deliberation is a lack of 4po6vr7aL, and whenever the artisan deliberates, he deliberates not qua artisan, but as one wanting somewhat with respect to his art (for it is ignorance that leads him to deliberate), but the artisan qua artisan does not need deliberation."-Except for the repetition of the error in the definition of deliberation, Philoponus is here following Aristotelian doctrine, as given in the Nicomachean Ethics (cf. 1112 a 34 ff.). It may be observed again that the only ignorance which leads a man to deliberate is ignorance of ways and means by which to attain a desired end. Philoponus illustrates at length the idea that the artisan does not deliberate qua artisan, and concludes (321. 11 ff.): "For we deliberate about the beginning (jpX'), the end (reXAo), and the way from the begin- ning to the end when these things are uncertain and indefinite." Here, unless he means by apx? and reAos, the first and last steps in the deliberative process, Philoponus is departing somewhat from Aristotelian doctrine. For Aristotle the 4pXv of a delibera- tion is its first principle and is in the deliberator himself,44 and the TcAog or end of a deliberation is not the subject of delibera- tion at all.45 Philoponus continues: "Therefore if they are going to deny nature a final cause because it doesn't deliberate, let them deny it to art too. But if they don't deny to art a final cause for this reason, then it were logical, I suppose, that they did not deny it to nature.-And why do I speak of arts, when even the Deity in His work of creation does not deliber- ate, but by the very fact that He is, whenever He wishes, He guides all things without needing any deliberation, if delibera- tion, as I said, takes place owing to a want of prudence. Accord- ingly, a final cause must by no means be denied to nature because she doesn't deliberate, since it is not denied to art nor to the Deity for the same reason." Two points are of interest here: (1) Philoponus does not here ascribe his definition of delibera- tion to Aristotle. (2) The doctrine that God guides the uni- verse aright simply by being is not Aristotelian. We have seen 4 Cf. Arist.

D. Nock to the pseudo-Aristo- telian treatise, De Mundo 397 b 22. It may then be later Peripatetic doctrine, as it has been conjectured that the De Mundo is a product of the Peripatetic school.46 We have, at any rate, further evidence that Philoponus does not confine himself to pure Aristotelian doctrine. It may then be said in conclusion that the history of the dis- cussion of God's deliberation or want of deliberation, is on the one hand a study of philosophic commonplace pointing towards such endless treatment and retreatment of this particular topic as to cast grave doubt upon the assignation of any particular source for any particular appearance of the topic, and is, on the other hand, a study in source-hunting designed to indicate the danger of fastening upon an entirely irretrievable work the first appearance of a commonplace, without making all due allowance for the history of the topic and the possible man- ner in which it may have fitted into the body of doctrine thus involved. The results of the present study may be summarized as follows: The sophistic type of "Homeric criticism," the tendency to base an argument upon a serious construction of a poet's words, probably gave birth to the topic, "Do the Gods Deliberate," in the latter part of the fifth century B. C., inas- much as the first reference to the topic, in Isocrates' Against the Sophists, seems to imply that such a topic already existed. The first serious and philosophic approach to the problem is found, not direct but implied, in Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. The early Stoics either did not know or ignored this treatment of Aristotle's.47 The early Sceptics availed themselves of this flaw in the Stoic system, and perhaps also borrowed from the Peri- patetic tradition of their day, to upset Stoic doctrine to the greater exercise of their penchant for ingenious dialectic, and with a view to establishing their own doctrine of "probability." After the explicit Sceptic treatment of the topic, the discussion of it becomes a commonplace of varying literary or philosophic character. The Neoplatonic treatment, while resting in the main upon Aristotle, is compelled by the Neoplatonic adherence 46 So Zeller4 III i 659. 47 I lean to the former alternative. 245</page><page sequence="22">246 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. to the Platonic doctrines of the purificatory nature of virtue and the likeness of the virtuous man to God, to recognize in God a virtue corresponding to that virtue of man whose special work is good deliberation, but to rob this virtue of its Aristotelian content in order to predicate it of God. The presence of the Neoplatonic connotation in the use to which Iamblichus puts the word Opo'vJrur in his Protrepticus, together with the fact that the Isles-of-the-Blest passages of both Iamblichus and Cicero presume the technical meaning given the word in Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, casts no little suspicion upon the assign- ment of this topic to Aristotle's early Protrepticus. Finally, in the late Aristotelian commentator, Philoponus, we see a hopeless confusion of Aristotelian and Neoplatonic thought in which deliberation is defined as the lack of that virtue with which it was almost identified by Aristotle, and that virtue now becomes identified with God in the phrase TO OEov aVTorpovratL &amp;EcrTv.
