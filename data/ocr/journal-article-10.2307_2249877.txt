<plain_text><page sequence="1">III.-THE " POLYTHEISM " OF PLATO: AN APOLOGIA. BY A. E. TAYLOR. LIKE other students of Plato, I have recently been reading with much enjoyment, and I hope much profit, Prof. F. M. Cornford's valuable translation of and commentary on the Timaeus (Plato's Cosmology, 1937). Neither my enjoyment nor my profit has, I trust, been seriously disturbed by the fact that I myself, as a recent commentator on and translator of the dialogue, come in, in the course of the volume, for a good deal of adverse criticism. It is true that I may be inclined to think that Mr. Cornford at times overdoes his flagellations, perhaps from a pious anxiety to carry out the apostolic injunction to reprove both " in season and out of season ". His polemic, I think, at times disguises an agreement between us on essential points which is not much alfected by the more superficial divergences which he prefers to dwell upon. But in the main I have no reason to take objection to his procedure. How is advance to be made in Platonic exegesis except by correction of one another's oversights and mistakes, and who is the natural target of the latest expositor of the Timaeus but his immediate precursor ? I should in any case have expected to find myself a principal object of Mr. Cornford's animadversions; I make no complaint of them, and I do not doubt that a fair number of them will prove to have been fully deserved, since, in the memorable words of Johnson, it is certain that a " fallible being will fail somewhere ". But there is one standing grievance against me urged with some vehemence all through Plato's Cosmology, which appears to me to rest in the main upon prejudice and misconception, and, at the same time, to be a matter of too much importance to be simply passed over without any reply from the incriminated party; and it is of this that I would speak briefly in these pages. The accusation is made from the outset in the Preface (p. xi), where I am said to make all through my own Commentary the " suggestion that Plato " (or Timaus ?) " is a monotheist, and not far from being a Christian ". " The Demiurge ", it is added, " is not fully recognised as a mythical figure, but credited with</page><page sequence="2">A. E. TAYLOR: " POLYTHEISM OF PLATO: AN APOLOGIA. 181 attributes belonging to the Creator of Genesis or even to the God of the New Testament." And the reader is referred to a footnote to my treatment of Tim. 29d, 30c and 69c 3 for illustra- tions. I will deal directly with the particular passages thus incriminated; for the moment I would make some remarks on the wav in which the main accusation is formulated where it is' first introduced. Manifestly, I should have said, two things are both true: that there are points of contact between Christianity and the religious teaching of Plato, and there are points of difference. The reality of the differences will, of course, be insisted on at once by Mr. Cornford, and has never for a moment been denied by me.' That points of contact are also there, I conceive even Mr. Cornford himself must admit. If they were not there, how could we explain the place given to Plato in the Christian Theism of Clement, of Origen, of Augustine, or the " Cambridge Platonists ", or again the carping depreciation of Christianity itself by Nietzsche as no more than Platonismus fiurs Volk ? Mr. Cornford, I take it, would not deny the resemblances, and I have no desire to deny the differences. The only point which can really be in dispute between us is the precise nature and extent of, these resemblances and differences, and a conclusion on that issue is only to be reached by a careful examination of details, not by a " slap-dash " pronouncement like that which I have quoted. I note again that in the pronouncement itself there is a certain ambiguity as to the main gravamen of the charge. Is my crime (1) that I wrongly imagine Plato as a ' Monotheist ', or (2) that I do not recognise the " mythical " character of his Demiurge, or (3) that I transfer to the Demiurge certain unspecified character- istics taken from the book of Genesis or from the New Testament ? It would be perfectly possible to do any one of these things without doing the others, and I am not sure whether I am being called on to answer one article of impeachment or three, or, if three, which is supposed to be the head and front of the offending. 1 Some remarks will be found on them, for example, in connection with the treatment of Plato, in my article " Theism " in the Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, where I have been careful, while insisting on the significance of Plato's Theism, to remark that his God is " not altogether all that Christian thinkers have meant by the Supreme." (I did not mean merely, what is naturally obvious, that Plato's God has not characters which Christian thinkers have generally agreed in regarding as only know- able to us by a specific historical 'revelation ', but that he must not be, without more ado, assumed to have all the characters Christian theologians and philosophers have often regarded as demonstrable by " the light of natural reason ".)</page><page sequence="3">182 A. E. TAYLOR: A little more light will, no doubt, be thrown on the matter by consideration of the strictures to be made in dealing with the passages mentioned in the foot-note. But before I come to them, I may be allowed to make one or two remarks about the general indictment. (1) As to 'Monotheism ', at this stage of the argument, I will merely observe that a comparison with page 30 seems to show that my crime consists in rendering Plato's repeated OEOs' (without the article) by ' God ' (with a capital letter), rather than 'the God' (a rendering I not unnaturally preferred to keep for OEos}1 This, it appears, is to forget that Plato was a 'pagan polytheist' (oc. cit.). But now, just what is a 'pagan', and just what is a ' polytheist' ? If every one is a ' pagan ' who has never heard of, or does not accept, a written Canonical Scripture, and if every one is a polytheist who uses the words OEoQ, di, gods, in the plural, no doubt Plato is a ' pagan polytheist '. But the word 'pagan', as we use it to-day, has come to have an ethical signifi- cance which makes it almost as misleading to call AZschylus or Plato 'pagans' as it would be to call them religieux.2 And what does 'polytheist' mean ? If Plato is a ' polytheist' because he speaks of ot OEo as well as of 0oEs, is Newton a polytheist because he maintains in the famous Scholium generale at the end of the Principia that " deity " consists in dominatio entis spiritualis, and actually appends a note explaining that the " Gentiles " were only wrong in calling deceased princes gods because, in their case, the dominium is absent ? Was Milton a " polytheist " because he 1 It is not possible to attain rigid consistency, but I have tried, as far as English idiom will permit, to make my usage in the matter conform to Plato's own. In point of fact, the common Greek T O EEov itself seems to me to have much the same " monotheistic " flavour as the eighteenth-century English " the Deity ". Are we to credit all the English writers who, apparently from fear of "anthropomorphism ", preferred to say "the Deity " rather than " God " with being polytheists ? On the other hand, is it not rightly generally recognised that the drift of the thought both of ABschylus and of Euripides about To' OEov is " monotheistic " in spite of the constant appearance of the Oeol of current mythology among their dramatis personae ? 2 If there are two things regularly implied about a man when he is currently called a pagan, they are (1) that he rejects the whole conception of the supreme significance of the moral values and a divine 'government of the world ' in accord with them, and (2) that, in consequence, he extols the following of " blood-instincts ", especially in matters connected with sex, as against the inhibitions of discipline and " convention ". On both points Plato is on the side of the Christians and against the " pagan The kind of poetry permitted in his State would have a strong family resemblance to the " psalms of Galilaeans " which moved the scorn of Swinburne. In a word, a " pagan " is worldly, whereas it is the standing complaint against Plato that he is so other-worldly.</page><page sequence="4">THE " POLYTHEISM OF PLATO: AN APOLOGIA. 183 used the word gods of his fallen angels ? Indeed, was Christ himself a polytheist when he called attention to a passage in which a psalmist " called them gods to whom the word of God came " ? Or is Plato's polytheism supposed to be shown not so much by language about GEoQ as by the fact that in his sketch of a cultus for the city of the Laws he provides a numerous body of recipients of worship ? He does so, but they are not more ntumerous than the saints and angels who figure in the Calendars of great Christian Churches and are certainly the objects of some- thing which can fairly be called cultus. It seems to me that the truth is not only that, as has often been remarked, the question whether there is only one " God " or more than one was never felt to be primary by a typically Greek thinker, but further that the real and important distinction between what is essentially polytheism and what is not must be drawn where, for instance, St. Thomas draws it. Where worship is given to a plurality of beings who are supposed to be indepen- denit of one another, and possibly hostile to one another, there is real fundamental polytheism. Where the beings to whom worship is addressed are conceived as under the sovereignty of a single supreme will and intelligence, of which the rest are the subordinate ministers and executants, there you have at least an implicit monotheism. It is on this ground that St. Thomas regards the ancient philosophers as much nearer to the true conception of Deity than the Manichaeans (S.C.G. 1, 42 adfin.: hac autem veritate repelluntur Gentiles, deorunm multitudinem con- fitentes; quamvis plures eorum unum deum esse summum dicerent, a quo omnes alios quos deos nominabant creatos esse asserebant, omnibus substantiis sempiternis divinitatis nomen adscribentes, et praecipue ratione sapientiae et felicitatis et rerum guber- nationis. Quae quidem consuetudo loquendi etiam in sacra Scriptura invenitur, dum sancti Angeli aut etiam homines vel iudices dii nominantur. . . . Unde magis huic veritati videntur contrarii Manichaei, duo prima principia ponentes quorum altera alterius causa non sit.) And, in fact, it might fairly be contended that in IEschylus, for example, the relation of Apollo and Athena to Zeus as the executors or revealers of his purposes does not differ in principle from that of the angels of Christian theologies to God. But if we draw the line of distinction here, there is, I conceive, no doubt on which side of it Plato is to be found. In the story of Timaeus, the lower 'visible' gods (the heavenly bodies) are made by the Demiurge (40a), who addresses them (41a)--for argument's sake I adopt without prejudice the reading and rendering of Mr. Cornford himself-as " beings whereof I am</page><page sequence="5">184 A. E. TAYLOR: the maker and of works the father ". The " invisible " gods, the figures of the current theogonies are all said to be offspring (40e) of Earth and Heaven, and Earth and Heaven have already been described as made by the same artificer. So in the tenth book of the Laws the Platonic theodicy turns on the point that " our King" ,(904a) has " contrived to post each several item " of the community of souls " so as to provide most utterly, easily, and well for the triumph of virtue and rout of vice throughout the whole ". Clearly it is meant at least that there is nowhere in the universe any independent power which can cause this divine purpose to fail of its intent. This being so, to allow Plato to speak of God (with the capital letter) is, I submit, to run much less risk of falsifying his thought than to call him a " pagan polytheist." 1 Again, it cannot be made the basis for discrimination between Plato and Christianity that the Demiurge of the Timaeus is a " mythical figure ", whereas the God of Christianity is not. For though the language used about the Demiurge, when he is described as mixing certain ingredients in a Kpac7p and com- pounding the bvXy of the universe, or the rational souls of men, from them, as delivering an oration to the " created divinities ", or as sowing the souls which he has fashioned, like crops, in the earth and the planets, is, of course, frankly pictorial imagery applied to the unimaginable, and so " mythical " in the Platonic sense of the word the Demiurge of the story stands for something -a supreme rational and righteous purposive agent operative throughout the whole of the universe-which Plato regards as no fancy but the most tremendous of realities, as Mr. Cornford, with the natural theology of the Laws before his eves, of course 1 Or, I would ask, if we are to deal in these hard and fast discriminations, was Plotinus a " polytheist " and was he a " pagan " ? If you mean by the words only that he admitted a plurality of beings whom he called OmoL, and made no objection to the official cultus of the Roman state, he was a polytheist. But it would produce a completely false impression if we said that the difference between Plotinus and Origen is that Plotinus is a worshipper of many gods, Origen of only one. The real personal religion of Plotinus consisted in a life-long effort after " unification " with an object of worship, the transcendent " One," by comparison with which the Deus unus et trinus of Origen and the Creeds might be said to be " many ". And similarly to call Plotinus a "pagan " would convey a completely false impression as to the points of resemblance and disagreement between his ethics and those of the Christian Church of the third century. It might fairly be said that, from the Christian point of view, the chief defect in his ethics is that he sets too exclusive a value on the " cathartic " (as Hume would call them, the " monkish ") virtues, and under-rates those of the ordinary good neighbour and citizen. Here he is, if anything, not pagan enough.</page><page sequence="6">THE " POLYTHEISM OF PLATO: AN APOLOGIA. 185 fully admits. And on the other side, the real " non-mythical " character of the God of the Old Testament or of Christianitv does not mean that Jew or Christian can avoid the constant use of pictorial and, in the Platonic sense, " mythical " language in describing the divine activities. When the apostle, for example, says that " we shall all stand before the judgement-seat of Christ ", he means to be asserting a fact of supreme moment; but can we suppose that the judgement-seat was, even to the writer's own mind, more than an imaginative symbol ? that he thought of it as a literal bench of wood or stone ,? Liber scriptus proferetur, Ex quo mundus judicetur; but did a divine of the Middle Ages ever suppose that record to be made with actual ink on actual paper or parchment ? Christ, the Creeds assert, is sitting " at the right hand of the Father ", but in what age of Christianity has it ever been imagined that the Father, in any literal sense, has a right hand or a left ? 1 The differences, whatever they are, between Plato's conception of God and the Christian, do not arise from the presence of "myth " in Plato and its absence from the language of Christians; they must be differences between the entirely non-mythical realities for which the parties take the word God or 0E0o's to stand, a point to which I shall shortlv return.2 Once more, the accusation that I have imported into Plato 1 Or again does any Jew or Christian (not being an American " Funda- mentalist ") imagine that there is nothing " mythical " in the description of God as extracting a rib from the side of Adam and making it into a woman, as laying aside " in the sky " the bow which He has been wielding during the Deluge, as " coming down " to Sodoni to see for Himself whether the misconduct of the inhabitants is as grave as has been reported, as " looking on the Egyptians out of the pillar of cloud " and so forth ? Johnson was traditionally orthodox enough for any man, but he had the sense to tell some one who made difficulties about the destruction of Sennacherib's army, " you are not to suppose that the angel of the Lord knocked them on the head, man by man ". 2 By saying that the divine vovs, of which the Demiurge is the imaginative symbol is itself a non-mythical real agent, I do not, of course, mean to prejudge the difficult question how this vovs is related to the Pvx^ of the universe. Certainly I believe that, with the whole of the Opera Platonis before us, we cannot well hold that Plato means simply to identify the two, and on that point at least, it seems to me that I have the support of M. Robin in the difficult pages of his Platon (244-252) which deal with " the Platonic Deity " (though, unfortunately, M. Robin (op. cit., 248) falls into the time-honoured mistake, rightly avoided by Mr. Cornford, of translating lKdV -ro voT-oD cO'S, alu9ros (Tim., 92, a, 7) as though it meant " a god perceptible to sense, an image of the intelligible god ", whereas it clearly means " an image of the intelligible ~4oov ". Editors would do well to repunctuate the whole clause thus, 4Coov oparov -ra opara 7replEXov, E&amp;KWV TOV VOqTOV , fO'os aa0,q-7-O'S).</page><page sequence="7">186 A. E. TAYLOR: ideas foreign to him borrowed from the Old or New Testament must, no doubt, be tested by an impartial examination of the evidence which is offered later, but it is unconsciously prejudging the issue to introduce a preliminary reference to the "c Creator" of Genesis. The suggestion, I take it, is that God, in the nar- ratives of Genesis-I do not know whether this means the narrative of the Priestercodex (Gen. I), or the more primitive story of " JE " (Gen. II)-really is a Creator, but that the Demiurge of the Timaeus is not represented as creating, but as arranging his material, which must, therefore, be supposed to be pre-existent. Now if this is what is meant, I would observe that in the Biblical, as in the Platonic, stories as told, there is naturally no explanation of the origin of the material. If the Demiurge in the Timaeus story is said to " take over " certain materials in a chaotic state and reduce them to order, it is equally not clear from the langugcye of Genesis that the writers originally intended to say that the " void and formless infinite " was itself created ex nihilo. That it was so is the Christian dogma, but it is another question whether the dogma, however true, can be extracted from the words of the narratives alone.' On the other hand, since Mr. Cornford is at one with me in rejecting the inter- pretation according to which Timeaus's picture of the world as it was before God had reduced it to order, represents a state of things which was ever actual, he cannot argue that the words of the Timaeus compel us to believe in a divinity who merely arranges pre-existing " material " of some kind. At most he is entitled to say that in his own opinion the narratives of Genesis ascribe a more unrestricted causality to God than that of Timeaus does to the Demiurge, and the point of his criticism is consequently blunted. It is blunted still more when it is observed that in no passage which he can cite from me have I ever used the technical expression (which I was, indeed, careful to avoid) " creation ex nihilo " in speaking of the cosmological story of the Timaeus.2 1 In the JE narrative the verb used for the divine action is simply the ordinary word for " to make ", which, of course, implies nothing about the origin of the material. The P story uses a different verb; whether this is intended to convey the notion of creation ex nihilo is a question for Hebrew philologists. In any case, though I have spoken of Plato's Demiurge as a Creator, as Plato himself calls him a 7rotofr js-, I have never -in my life spoken of him as creating the world ex nihilo. Where his " materials" come from is a question I have left unraised, as Plato himself seems to me to have done. 2 In speaking of the Demiurge of the Timceus as a " creator ", I meant to indicate that I do not regard him as a " mythical " doublette of the ozpavos or its Ovx- (as, e.g., Archer-Hind did), without committing myself by the word to any decision on the further question whether he is supposed to create ex nihilo.</page><page sequence="8">THE " POLYTHEISM" OF PLATO: AN APOLOGIA. 187 I believe, however, that, so far as the complaint about im- portations from Genesis is concerned, what is reallv in Mr. Cornford's mind is explained by the footnote to page 27. Here he quotes me as saying that the meaning of creation in Christian theology is " that the physical world does not exist in its own right, but depends on a really self-existing being, God, for its existence ", and retorts that " myriads of Jews and Christianrs " have believed andl do believe in a temporal beginning of the world. The suggestion is that " creation " implies an antecedent time when there was no world, and that I am therefore inconsistent with myself in both speaking of Plato's Demiurge as a creator and accepting, with Mr. Cornford himself, the standing Academic view that Plato believed in no such time before the world was. But here I must persist, with all respect, in holding that my own utterances are perfectly consistent and that Mr. Cornford has simply fallen into error. It is true, as he says, that myriads of Jews and Christians have believed, and do believe, in a " first moment of creation ". But their reason for the belief is not that they think creation ab aeterno an intrinsic impossibility, but that they regard it as false on the strength of the " revelation " made in the opening words of Genesis I. The position of St. Thomas on this matter is perfectly clear, and it has been made by his arguments generally dominant among Christian theologians who adhere to the traditional view of the inerrancy of Scripture. St. Thomas held that it can be strictly proved without any appeal to theological authority that the world originated by creation, and that creation means the complete causation of the whole reality of that which is said to have been created. (De potentia, Q. 3, art. 1. Tenendum est firmiter quod Deus potest facere aliquid ex nihilo et facit. ... Unde per suam actionem producit totum ens subsistens nullo praesupposito, utpote qui est totius esse principium, et secundum se totum. Et haec eius actio vocatur creatio.)' At the same 1 The " proof " of the proposition quod Deus ex nihilo produxit res in esse is given at full length in S.C.G. II, 16. It claims to be a philosophical demonstration, and, as usual in the S.C.G., which was intended to be of service to missionaries among the " Gentiles ", no appeal is made to Biblical authority except that, when the demonstration has been concluded, we are told that our result is confirmed by the words of Genesis I, 1. The question whether the created world has always existed is discussed separately (II, 31-37), and the conclusion reached is simply that " there is nothing to forbid the assumption made by the Catholic Faith that the world has not always existed "; in II, 38 the arguments produced by " some " to prove that the world must have had a beginning are reviewed and pronounced inconclusive, " non de necessitate concludunt, licet probabilitatem habeant ". Cf. W. R. Inge, God and the Astronomers, p. 242,</page><page sequence="9">188 A. E. TAYLOR: time, he caused a veritable sensation by the essay de aeternitate mundi, in which he set himself expressly to refute the previously current attempts of earlier schoolmen to prove the necessity of a first moment of creation, and to show that, so far as reason is. concerned, the fact that the universe is a created thing is perfectly compatible with its having always been in existence. We know, he said, that it has not always been there, but we only know this from the authoritative declaration of God himself in the Penta- teuch that " in the beginning God made heaven and earth ". The question for philosophy, he says, is this: utrum esse creatumn a Deo secundum totam substantiam, et non habere durationis principium repugnent ad invicem, vel non. Quod autem non repugnent sic ostenditur, and he proceeds to develope his argu- ments. Thus in distinguishing between a created thing and a, thing which must necessarily have had a beginning I am at least in good company. I do not complain that Mr. Cornford should apparently not know the Thomistic position in the matter, but I am surprised that he should have written as though the belief of ordinary Jews and Christians has been based on anything but acquiescence in an authoritative " revelation ". (I trust it will be clear that my appeal to St. Thomas in this matter is not meant in any way to suggest that his view must be the correct one. If I had thought that in commenting on the Timaeus I had any right to introduce my own personal opinion, such as it is, on such a topic, I should have stated that, rightly or wrongly, it does seem to me at least the probable view that the universe had a, " beginning ", but I should have thought it an impertinence to dwell on the point.' And I may add that for any one who regards the question as one to be settled by the authority of Scripture, independently of philosophical argument, it would always be possible to combine the doctrine of creation with the assertion that the world has always been in existence, by adopting the Augustinian interpretation of the words Ev acpXii, in principio, according to whicb the " beginning"? meant is not a "first moment ", but the divine Word or Wisdom itself; ipsum est verbum tuum, quod et principium est (Confessions, XI, viii, 10). I come now to consider certain more specific strictures made by Prof. Cornford in the course of his commentary. I may deal though I think he is going too far when he says that the position which St. Thomas accepted on the authority of Scripture was clearly " unwelcome to him ". 1 And likewise if I had thought it right to import one's own personal opinions about the meaning of " omnipotence " into the discussion it would have been found that mine, for what they are worth, are, provisionally at any rate, more moderate than those of either Scotists or Thomists.</page><page sequence="10">THE "POLYTHEISM" OF PLATO: AN APOLOGIA. 189 first with those which are made in connection with the exposition of Tim. 29e ff. Timseus is here professing to explain-I give his words as Mr. Cornford renders them-why " becoming and this universe were framed by him who framed them ". The reason for this is said to be that " he was good; and in the good no jealousy in any matter can ever arise. So, being without jealousy, he desired that all things should come as near as possible to being like himself ". In my own comment I had first remarked that " jealousy " does not quite unambiguously reproduce the force of Plato's word 0&amp;0vos', which means, to speak more pre- cisely, the " dog-in-the-manger " temper which desires to engross all that is good to one's self. I went on to say " just because God is good, He does -not keep His blessedness selfishly to Him- self. He seeks to make something else as much like Himself in goodness." (Here I regret that by an oversight the words " as possible " have somehow fallen out of my text after " Himself ".) " It is of the very nature of love and goodness to ' overflow' ". The remarks, observes my critic, are misleading. For (1) the use of the capital letter in the word God suggests that Plato was a monotheist, whereas in fact he believed in the divinity of the world and of the heavenly bodies. (2) The Epinomis contem- plates a cult of these heavenly bodies. (3) The Demiurge is not an 'object of worship' or a 'religious figure', and therefore must not " be equated with the one God of the Bible, who created the whole world out of nothing, and is also the supreme object of worship ". (4) " Still less is there the slightest warrant in Greek thought of the pre-Christian centuries for the notion of ' over- flowing love ', or love of any kind, prompting a god to make a world." Now as to (1) and as to the clause about creating a world "out of nothing ", I think I have already said sufficiently all that I have to say. With regard to (2) and to what is said in (3) about an " object of worship ", a " religious figure '", I should like to draw a necessary distinguo. What is meant here by an "object of worship"? It is true enough, and I presume Mr. Cornford would not dispute my acquaintance with the fact, that no provision is made in the cult of the city contemplated in the Laws and Epinomis for public worship of any deities, superior to the heavenly bodies and the patrons of the city and its various divisions. It is not even clear to me that the Epinomis con- templates any public rites in honour of the Ov'pavo's' as distin- guished from the heavenly bodies it contains, and the Laws says nothing of any such ritual in honour of " our King " or of "the best soul ". But is it meant that the feelings betrayed by Plato's language in all these dialogues towards the " maker and</page><page sequence="11">190 A. E. TAYLOR: father of all ", "the King ", " the best soul " are not specifically emotions of religious veneration ? The question is not simply to whom or what does Plato expect the citizens of " Magnesia " to do public worship, but rather, whom or what does Plato in his own view adore as the summum numen. Every reader must, no doubt, answer this question for himself, according to the personal impression which the Platonic utterances make upon him, and no one reader can expect to demonstrate to another that his own interpretation of the mind of Plato is the one " objective ' interpretation. I must be content to record my own deep impression that the language with which Plato speaks of that supreme morally righteous intelligence for which the Demiurge stands in the Timaeus, and the apcrr'a OavXry in the Laws, is charged with a deep emotion of a kind which can only be called religious. If there is on my side a possible danger of reading too much into Plato, there is, I am convinced, a worse danger of evacuating his profoundest meaning in such a note as that which Mr. Cornford writes on page 35 of his book, where the Demiurge of Timaeus is all but equated with beings like the Baiame of the Australians, superannuated " makers " who at some distant time constructed the world and have now " retired from active service ". A comparison of this kind simply ignores that moral government of men and the universe which is as prominent in the Timaeus as it is in the Laws, and would have been still more prominent if the Critias had not remained the fragment which it is.' The point which I have numbered (4) calls for rather more remark. It does not seem to have occurred to Mr. Cornford that in the sentence to which he takes exception I was intending an allusion not only to the sayings of the Christian mystics about the love which " cannot be idle ", but to the Neo-Platonic thesis that the supreme " One ", which is also the "Good ", mtust, because it is " more than full" (v'7rp-ErA-qpES) "overflow ". It is just because it is good that it "flows over ". Timaeus tells us that it is a sufficient answer to the question why the Demiurge should " make " at all, to say that he is good, and therefore will not keep his goodness as a solitary possession for himself, but will communicate it to something else. There is, as it seems to me, a real analogy between this thought of a goodness which will not let its possessor be content with the having of it to himself, and the later thought, to which I alluded, of the " love which cannot 1 For it is plain that the moral purpose of " the God of gods Zeus " to chasten the 5fipts, of the Atlantidoe was to be the motif of the whole story. It was to be not only an eulogy of the virtue of prehistoric Athens but the record of a divine " mighty act ".</page><page sequence="12">THE " POLYTHEISM OF PLATO: AN APOLOGIA. 191 be idle ", and I hold that I was justified in indicating the analogy. That there is more than an analogy I did not say and do not say. In fact, I think it quite clear where the fundamental difference comes in. That there is a sense in which God loves man, His creature, is a thought which, as I hold, cannot be denied to Plato without making nonsense of, for example, the eloquence of the Republic on the text that the just man is 0EoqtA'so and the unjust 0O,EoVt rJs (X, 612e), and many another passage in the dialogues of similar purport. It was not reserved for Christianity to " reveal " it to the world that " the righteous Lord loveth the righteous ". But in the Platonic dialogues, as in much of the Old Testament, a' man has first to make himself an object deserving of God's regard by being righteous before he becomes OEoqtAjs. The novelty by which Christianity caused infinite scandal to the respectable of the ancient world was its declaration that the " righteous Lord " loves the sinner and the unrighteous. and has set himself to win their love at an infinite cost. " He first loved us ", " while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us ".L Whenever you come upon the thought of the prevenient grace of God, you are dealing with something new in Christianity which had its anticipations in Hebrew prophecy, but not in Greek philosophy, and I do not think I can be justly charged with having overlooked the fact. Certainly I did not dwell on the point in commenting on the Timaeus; I thought that to do so would have been both irrelevant, and in view of the familiarity of the fact, superfluous. It appears from Prof. Cornford's strictures that I was mistaken in my judgement. But the error of judgement, if it was an error, seems to me a venial one. Prof. Cornford's anxiety to divest the words of his " pagan polytheist " of all possible resemblances to anything Christian seems to me to lead to a graver error in the other direction. He empties the statement, that the goodness of the Demiurge is the explanation of the existence of the universe, of its significance, and the " most. characteristic revelations of the Founder of Christianity " (p. 35) of the very thing which is most characteristic of them.2 I Celsus, for example, makes a special point of complaining that the ranks of the Christians are recruited from the criminal and disreputable classes. He thinks, in fact, that if Christ were divine, he should have come to call not sinners, but the just men who need no repentance. If I had anywhere professed to find the redeeming and sanctifying love of the Christian God in Plato, I own I should deserve Mr. Cornford's rebukes. The great " new " declaration of the Gospel was not that God has created the world and cares for it, but that He has " sent redemption to his people ". 2 J grant at once that if I had shown the slightest desire to imitate the early Fathers who found the Christian Trinity, or something very like it,</page><page sequence="13">192 A, E. TAYLOR: There is a further polemic against myself, closely connected with the same general subject, in the part of Mr. Cornford's commentary where he is discussing the meaning of the " necessity " which is said at Tim. 48a and elsewhere to be a subordinate causative factor along with the Demiurge, or " God ", or " mind " in the construction of the universe. On what is meant by this cc necessity " in the first instance, indeed, we seem to be in pretty close agreement. We are both convinced that it does not mean anything like " natural law ", and both, I think, equally agreed -that what it does stand for is what I have called bare " brute fact ", arrangements which we find to be actually there in things but which cannot be seen to serve any good and reasonable purpose, or even seem, on the face of it, to counteract such pur- poses, the apparent " dysteleology " in nature, as it is sometimes ,called. This is at least what I understand Plato to mean, and I think I am not wrong in saying that Mr. Cornford understands him in the same sense. What Prof. Cornford objects to is my further comrnment that even where we do not see " what the good of " such bruLte fact is, " if we think with Timaeus and Plato we feel satisfied that it satisfies some good end. . . . If we could ever have complete knowledge, we should find that avayKn had vanished from our account of the world." Mr. Cornford com- plains (p. 165) that the remark is due to an illegitimate " desire -to make Plato's Demiurge really omnipotent ". His own inter- pretation is that the Demiurge is not omnipotent but hampered in his proceedings by the fact that he is dealing with materials " which he can, within limits, turn to his purpose, but which he did not institute ". He does the best he can, in fact, and if the best is often only a poor job, we must lay the blame not on the 'well-intentioned workman but on his materials. Now I admit, of course, that it is perfectly possible to read the language of the dialogue in this sense. But I deny that it is imperative that we should do so. I do not find in the Timaeus, or anywhere else in Plato, any more than I find in any philosopher or divine, an " explanation " of the existence of " evil ", and I in the Timaeus, I should richly deserve all Mr. Cornford has said of me. There one is really trenching on the special Christian " good news " of the xredemptive action of God. But merely to say that Plato conceives of the whole " natural order " as expressing the conscious purpose of a sovereign moral intelligence which he describes in language which would fairly entitle it to be called, in the terminology of a much later age, personal does not seem to me to be ascribing anything peculiarly Christian, or Biblical, to him. To abstain from saying as much as this, out of fear of being thought to 'modernise', seems to me to be doing an injustice to a ,great religious thinker.</page><page sequence="14">THE " POLYTHEISM " OF PLATO: AN APOLOGIA. 193 do not suppose that he had one. It is Air. Cornford who puts such an explanation into Plato's mouth by making him say that the Demiurge is doing all he can with materials which he can only very imperfectly control. My reason for being dissatisfied with this exegesis is not that I start with the conception of a God who is omnipotent, in the sense of being able to do " just anything and everything ", and am determined to read this notion into Plato at all costs. It is the very different reason that the theory of external " limitations " due to the incontrol- lability of " material " seems to me to ruin that demonstration of the sovereignty and finality of the moral government of the world by " our King " on which the Laws lays so much stress. If the " King " is only, to use the phrase of Descartes, " a Jupiter or a Saturn ", I do not see how Plato can speak of the impossibility of escape from his judgements with the tone of absolute assurance which he does in fact employ, and I simply cannot believe that in the Laws he is preaching, for purposes of edification, a doctrine which he does not really hold. The very words of my own to which Mr. Cornford takes exception do not seem to me to go beyond what is implicit in such utterances as those of Laws 903, " For each and all there are, in every case, governors appointed of all doing and being done to, down to the least detail, who have achieved perfection even to the minute particulars. . . . Thou hast forgotten in the business that the purpose of all that happens is what we have said, to win bliss for the life of the whole; it is not made for thee, but thou for it. For any physician or craftsman in any profession does all his work for the sake of some whole, but the part he fashions for the sake of the whole, to contribute to the general good, not the whole for the part's sake." It is just possible, no doubt, without formal logical self-contradiction to talk thus, meaning no more than that the " craftsman " to whom the moral order in the world is due does the best he can for " the whole ", when the difficulties of the task are fairly taken into account; but one who meant only this could hardly, I think, venture to speak of the outcome in the tone of " sure and certain hope " which pervades the whole of this outburst. Can it reallv be said that a student with such language in his mind is falsifying Plato's thought in ascribing to him-and it is all I have ascribed to him-the belief that the so-called " dysteleology " in the natural order does after all serve " the good of the whole ", though we may never be able to see how? 1 1 It may, no doubt, be said that on Plato's own showing in the Laws there are bad souls as well as good ones-and where do the bad souls come from ? As to that I can only say that Plato has never offered any explanation and 13</page><page sequence="15">194 A. E. TAYLOR: - I suspect that Mr. Cornford himself would have scrupled less about my language but for an unfortunate prepossession of his own which is itself a kind of theological prejudice. He seems to me to write with his mind full of a rather crude notion of divine omnipotence as meaning ability, as I have put it, to " do anything and everything "; to suppose mistakenly that I mean to read omnipotence of this kind into the Timaeus, and to denounce this as an improper " Christianisation " of Plato. I am sure that on reconsideration he will see that I have never credited Plato's " father and maker " with omnipotence of this sort, and moreover that it is not what serious Christian divines have meant when they have talked of the omnipotence of God. The schoolmen, for example, were all agreed that God is omnipotent, yet, as Mansel once reminded Mill, their works are full of enumerations of " things which God cannot do ". And I remark that the well- selected examples of " dysteleology " by which Mr. Cornford illustrates his interpretation of Plato's thought will, all of them, equally well illustrate my own. He remarks, for example, that "the function of bone ", according to our dialogue, "is to protect from injury the seat of life, the brain and marrow." Bone therefore must be hard, but its hardness entails " as a necessary but undesirable concomitant " that it shall also be brittle and liable to fracture. It would be in itself desirable, again, that the skull should be protected against injury, like other parts of the osseous structure, by being thick and having a covering of flesh. But in that case sense-perception, and consequently intelligence, would be duller. Hence our " artificers " have preferred to sacrifice the minor benefits to the major (p. 175). But he does not observe that all this might be freely admitted by philosophers who would absolutely deny that their Deity is limited in his action by any extrinsic conditions. - Leibniz, for example, who was a pronounced Theist and creationist and believed himself to be championing a very high conception of divine omnipotence, would have said at once that the sort of " dysteleology" illus- trated by these examples merely results from the consideration that I conceive him to have had no explanatory theory to produce. I do not believe he thought any dogma or philosopheme would solve " all questions in the world and out of it ". So, in the Timaeus itself, we may ask in vain where the contents of the vt7roSoXo come from. Clearly they are inchoate disorderly Ktv7EaLts, and all Ktv7 acts, we may presume, are due to IvXai. But the only IvXata of which the dialogue has anything to say are represented as made by the Demiurge when he takes over the contents of the vt7roSox7 and reduces them to order. The story is myth, to be sure, but it must stand for something, and it is not clear what it can stand for.</page><page sequence="16">THE " POLYTHEISM OF PLATO: AN APOLOGIA. 195 that not all things which are singly possible are also compossible; it is true that God cannot combine the incompossible, but the reason why God cannot do so is not that He is confronted by conditions independent of Him in the face of which He is powerless, but that the undertaking is, in its own nature, irrational, and is therefore made impossible to God by His own intrinsic rationality. He cannot make bones which have the other qualities of bone without its brittleness for the same reason that he cannot make another God, or make it false that an event which has happened has happened. I am not, of course, suggesting that Plato was a Leibnizian, but merely trying to point out that the same distinction between the " work of God " and the " work of necessity " wvhich is exemplified by the illustrations Mr. Cornford produces from the Timaeus, recurs also in a philosophy which is from first to last theistic, and entirely opposed to the recognition of any " outside," conditions as limiting God's creative activity; the recognition of the distinction, then, does not commit us to a denial.of divine omnipotence in any sense in which the God of most Christian philosophers can be said to be omnipotent. If we ask why every arrangement of things which might appear to us to be desirable is not compossible with every other, Plato's language leaves it possible to suppose that the reason lies in some external limitations restricting the " maker of all things ", but it does not necessitate that interpretation. There is nothing in what he says which is inconsistent with the belief that the liability of our bones to fractures, however inconvenient to ourselves, may yet, in some unknown way, contribute to " the good of the whole ". And as for another sentence which is quoted from me (pp. 172-173) for disapprobation, that " Plato does not mean that some things are due to intelligence and others to mere mechanism ", its real sense is so innocuous that Mr. Cornford might adopt it himself. I meant in those words only to say that we must not call one concrete. fact A a product of God in which " necessity " plays no part, and another B a product of necessity in which God has played no part; any A or any B is at once a " product 'of God " and a " product of necessity ". The bones, to take Mr. Cornford's example, are described by Timaus as made by God (or the gods) on a certain plan and for a certain purpose; in virtue of their uinfortunate brittleness they are also a product of "necessity ". Whichever of us is right about the way in which "necessity" originates, I hold that I am merely repeating Timaus himself in adding the comment- that, according to him, "God ", or</page><page sequence="17">196 A. E. TAYLOR: "intelligent purpose " is the " principal ", "necessity " only the virrqpErn. in all undertakings.' I do not, indeed, contend that Plato must be supposed to have carried out this conviction with absolute self-consistency. Such strict consistency with one's self in all one's utterances seems to be an ideal which no actual human mind ever succeeds in attaining. Has there ever been a philosopher against whom critically-minded successors have not been able to bring the charge of unconscious self-contradiction ? It has been used alike against Aristotle, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Kant, to mention only names of the first order of distinction, and in all these cases the charge seems to have been fairly made out. Why must the "divine Plato " be supposed to be immune from the common lot of mankind, even of metaphysical mankind ? And it is particularly where men are brought face to face with the issues raised by their relation to God-or whatever- other name they give to the suLpreme reality of realities (o -t 7io-E ovopacdopEvos- pa'Atr-r' av S'XoC?o, Tovi' 71/iv covopa40c)-that such inconsistencies are most likely to make themselves felt. Most of the greatest philosophers have also been men with a real religion which has meant a great deal to them, even when their religion has been, as has been said of Aristotle, one peculiar and private to themselves. It is not among men of the kind who have been called " deity-blind " that 1 And though I have used the obvious example of Leibniz to show that the admission of the apparent " dysteleology " in nature does not necessi- tate the belief that God must be confronted with unfavourable " external conditions " in His activity, I do not mean to commit myself to acquiescence in the Leibnizian solution of the problem. For Leibniz remains, when all has been said, at bottom, a strict Predestinationist. God is, after all, the ultimate first cause of the treason of Judas, which He has included ab aeterno in his choice to create just that " possible world " which has been created. Here, though tentatively and with full recognition of the obscurity of the problem, I think too little is conceded to the free will of man. On ethical grounds I feel myself driven to agree with Kant's view that a rational agent is not only a free cause but a first cause of his own acts, and that the words of the Republic are strictly true, aIrta C'Ao,uvov, coEs ava'rtos, and I know that many Christian divines would say the same thing. But even if this be granted to constitute in some sense a " limitation " on the " omnipotence " of God, it is a limitation which must arise not from " external conditions " but from the intrinsic character of the divine purpose to create free moral agents. And I am not suggesting that this view was, in fact, that of Plato. I only say of it that it could, -like other views-be, in the language of Mr. Cornford himself (op. cit., p. 39) " supported by a suitable selection of texts " from the dialogues. That all " souls " have been made by a supreme free agent is asserted in the Timaeus, and however " mythical " the story of their making may be, it does at least seem to mean that they depend entirely and solely on Him for their existence.</page><page sequence="18">THE "POLYTHEISM" OF PLATO: AN APOLOGIA. 197 the superlatively great metaphysicians have been found. And a man's attitude towards his numen or nutmina, though it is, or ought to be, an attitude of the whole man, of his intellect no less than of his will or his emotions, is apt to be pregnant with much which cannot be fitted into the neat rubric of " clearly and distinctly " conceived categories and distinctions which he applies to that which is felt to stand on the same level with himself, or with the mere " things " he finds subject to his manipulation. If you start by docketing A as a " pagan polytheist " and B as a " Christian monotheist ", and imagine yourself in this easy way to have plucked the heart out of their mystery, why, then, I should say, unless both men are of a very common-place order of mind, you will only succeed in misrepresenting them both alike. Minds of any real depth are like the " Lesbian " archi- tecture; the " canons " you apply to them must be uoAi/83vot, "flexible ". There is just one other passage upon which I have made remarks which are singled out by Prof. Cornford for condemnation on the same general grounds. It is said at Tim. 69c 3 that of our " divine " part the Demiurge av-rTo ylyvErac &amp;?lALoVPvyos', whereas in respect of our " mortal " part, he merely instructs " his offspring " to fashion it. Since the distinction is made so pointedly, I was led to suppose that in writing the words avTos' ylcyvErar 8)(Lovpyos' Plato had in mind the familiar word avirovpyos' commonly used of the " peasant cultivator " who is too poor to have his bodily labour done for him by slaves, as opposed to the "large proprietor " who merely sits at his ease and sets other hands to work on the " menial " tasks. This led me to make the comment that the thought of God as " serving " His creatures, or being accessible to them at all, except through the mediation of a whole hierarchy of officials, is commonly held to be speci- fically Christian and quite un-Hellenic. The remark, I said, has truth, " if not pressed too far ", but the language of our passage shows that " its author understood the principle of the words, I am among you as one that serveth ". I should have thought that the observation, given as it was as a mere caution against pushing a roughly sound distinction too far, and confining itself to a mention of the principle (not the full scope of application) of the New Testament phrase quoted, was innocent enough. But Mr. Cornford specially calls attention to it for reprobation in his Preface (p. xi), and when he comes to the passage in his own commentary, magisterially observes (p. 280) that " there is no suggestion in the Greek avio'S of the 'lowly peasant' (a3Tovpyo's) " whom I have brought into the matter. Now how</page><page sequence="19">198 A. E. TAYLOR:- does Mr. Cornford know this 2 avwrovpyos was a familiar word, and did regularly imply a lowlv status. It is deliberately meant, for example, by Euripides, when he depicts Electra as married to an avvrovpyos', that Aegisthus was not satisfied with making a " farmer's wife " of a Pelopid princess; he safeguarded himself further by taking care that the farmer should be a person so utterly insignificant that he could not employ labourers to do his hard work. Is there anything unnatural in the suggestion that Plato could hardly write j8quoV'pyqacEv av-os' without thinking of these linguistic associations, and that he meant bv it something like this, " on our divine part God (or the god, if Mr. Cornford prefers that rendering) did the work that had to be done with His own hands ? " Of course, it is impossible to prove that Plato may not have used a phrase, which so naturally recalls the av3rovpyos?, unintentionally, and I should have no comment to make if Mr. Cornford had simply given it as his personal opinion that Plato did so. I should, I believe, still have thought this unlikely, but should never deny that it is possible. What I dispute is any man's right-presumably on the strength of an a priori theory as to what is and what is not Hellenic-to state his opinion on the point as unqualified fact.' There are certain observations of Prof. G. Murray, in the Preface to his version of the Hippolytus and Baccchae, which seem to me very apposite. " Who is to say what the 'spirit ' of Euripides really was ? My version of it will differ greatly from that of many men of far greater learning. Some good scholars, again (and innumerable bad ones !) have a rigidly fixed conception of what is in the limits of ' ancient thought ', and what is ' Christian ' or ' modern ', and may consider that I ought to have stopped my ears and refused to listen when Euripides seemed to transgress these limits." Substitute the name of Plato here for that of Euripides, and the remark seems to me equally pertinent. LEschylus, again, as Lewis Campbell said, might seem to us 1 I might even ask whether Mr. Cornford's remarks have not a family resemblance to the suggestion that " the gods " disdain to trouble them- selves with any close attention to their KcT-q'IaTa out of p,aovwa Kcat Tpvdf5, which is so decidedly negatived at Laws, 901e.

I do not feel that I have the right to allow preconceived distinctions of this kind to make me.insensitive to the subtler suggestions of a master of language like Plato.' 1 There are two contrasted prejudices against both of which we need to be constantly on our guard in dealing with Greek morality and religion, and both alike make for the exaggeration of the 'differences between " Hellenic " and " Christian ". A man strongly convinced that Christianity rests on a unique divine revelation will be tempted to under-rate the significance of the contacts between Hellenism and Christianity from his very sense of the uniqueness of Christianity. Dislike of Christianity will equally incline the anti-Christian who happens to admire the great Greeks to shut his eyes to these contacts for fear of having to admit in them any likeness to that which he despises. But a perceptive man, Christian or anti-Christian, should surely be able to understand that the secret of Plato's life-long hostility to " tragedy " is his antipathy to the " paganism" of the rituals and legends upon which tragedy was based.</page></plain_text>
