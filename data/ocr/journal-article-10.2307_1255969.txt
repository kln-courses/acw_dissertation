<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MYTHOLOGY OF THE KALEVALA, WITH NOTES ON BEAR-WORSHIP AMONG THE FINNS. BY WILFRID BONSER, Ph.D. THE Kalevala is our chief authority for the ancient religion of the Finns : only second in importance is the Loitsu-runoja or Magic Songs.1 Besides these original sources, there is the work of Bishop Michael Agricola, a reformer among the Finns, who prefaced his translation of the Psalter into Finnish (1551) by a list, in verse, of the various heathen deities of Finland. The Finnish gods are largely anthropomorphic, and, if not actually described as such, are at least endowed with the powers and characteristics of men. They are not repre- sentations of abstract qualities manufactured for the guidance of mankind. They are usually much nearer to nature than the corresponding supernatural beings in Greek myths. It is always the point of view of the human in his dealing with the various deities which is represented ; thus, the poet tells of the sun coming down into the boughs of a birch-tree, so that its rays may be the more potent. Each Finnish god is married, and in many cases has a family. The sons and daughters help their father in the guardianship of his peculiar care. The minor gods and goddesses are divine like the greater ones, and each is supreme in his or her own sphere. The more powerful gods have a marked grandeur and dignity of their own: over them magic has no power, but they are often besought by suppliants to turn aside the magic of sorcerers. 1 Translated into English by J. Abercromby, Pre- and Proto-historic Finns, (Grimm Library, vol. io, 1898), vol. ii. 344</page><page sequence="2">Notes on Bear-Worship among the Finns. 345 Ukko, Ahto, and Tuoni in Finnish mythology correspond roughly with Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades respectively. As Poseidon owed his importance to the extent of the Greek coast-line and the constant contact of the Greeks with the sea; so with the Finns the forest-god, Tapio, is perhaps as im- portant as Ahto, owing to their great familiarity with forests as well as with the sea. Thus the Finnish deities naturally fall under the four main heads of air, sea, forest, and the dead. I. The Air.-The word Jumala 2 (thunder-home), like the Greek word Zeus, went through various changes of meaning : first the sky, then the god of the sky, then the supreme god. In Esthonian it is the name given to the Christian God. The sky god is also called Ukko.3 As well as being a god of the air, he was also an agricultural deity, since the farmer was dependent on him for rain for his crops. It is to Ukko, therefore, that Vainamoinen prays (Rune 2) after his sowing:- " Give us, Ukko, rain from heaven, Let the clouds all drip with honey, That the corn-ears be uplifted, That the standing corn may rustle." He is the guardian of cattle, and it is to him that Ilmarinen's wife prays that her herd may be safe with Kullervo (Rune 32). He is the god of thunder as well as of rain and snow; the lightning comes from his sword. The oak is " Jumala's tree," in the same way as the oak is sacred to Zeus. In the Kalevipoeg, the sacred oak-forest of Taara (=Ukko) is situated in the far north.4 Like Thor, he carries a hammer. It is Ukko who recreates fire when the sun and moon have been stolen.5 The rainbow (Ukon-kaari) is his bow, and his arrows are of copper. It is more in the capacity of All. 2 From jum, onomatopoeic, and -la, local suffix ( = Teutonic -heim). 3 Cognate with Magyar agg, " old." Cf. Turkish aga, only applied to persons of high rank. 4 Kalevipoeg, Canto I. 6 Kalevala, Rune 47.</page><page sequence="3">346 The Mythology of the Kalevala with father and supreme god that he is invoked to restore Lemminkainen to life. He is spoken of as seated on a cloud, and, like Atlas, he bears the firmament. In the Kalevala, he has many attributes of royalty and pre-eminence. He rides in a scarlet sledge ; his clothing is of purple ; he wears crimson and silver-tinselled sandals and blue stockings; while the edge of his skirt sparkles with fire. The butterfly is sacred to him, and is called " Ukko's dog " (Ukon-koira). His wife is Rauni, who, however, does not appear in the Kalevala. Though called the " first of all creators " in one Version, it is noteworthy that Ukko takes no part in the story of the creation as narrated in the first rune of the Kalevala. There are many poetical epithets applied to him, such as " the shepherd of the lamb-clouds" and " the father of the heavens; " he is also called the " Navel of Heaven." The Esthonian supreme god and creator is Vana-Isa (Old-Father). Various other sky deities are mentioned in the Kalevala, especially the Sun- and Moon-gods, Paiv~ and Kuu. The worship of the sun was imported by the Lapps from the Scandinavians. The sun and moon both have daughters; those of the former are described (in Rune 41) as weaving with combs of silver, those of the latter use golden shuttles. The Kalevala always speaks of the golden moonlight, and of the silver sunshine. The chief constellation is Otava, the great Bear. The bear himself (Otso) was supposed to have been born in heaven, but he is more correctly a forest-divinity, whence his name of " Forest-apple" in the Kalevala; he is also connected with the worship of the dead. Orion's belt is called Vaina- moinen's scythe. The Milky Way is the " Bird's Way," (i.e. the way of souls). In the Edda, the souls flit in the nether-world in the form of birds; in Hiawatha also the Milky Way is called " the white road in heaven, pathway of the ghosts, the shadows." All names compounded with ilma, "air," may have</page><page sequence="4">Notes on Bear-Worship among the Finns. 347 originally been air-deities. Such are Ilmatar, the mother of Vainamoinen, and Ilmarinen himself, who may have been originally a kind of Finnish Thor. It has been suggested that he was the air-god of the Finns before they came into contact with Europeans.6 There are three maidens of the air, called Luonnotars, who are created by Ukko to be the mothers of iron.7 Comparetti compares them with the three norns of Scandinavian mythology, and connects their name both with luonto (nature), and with luote (destiny). The magic songs describe them as " sitting as they sob and weep where three roads part, four rivers flow; they gather pains, torments they cram into a speckled chest."s The goddess who presided over fogs and mists was Udu- tar. It is to her that Louhi prays that she may delay Vainamoinen and Ilmarinen as they are escaping with the Sampo (Rune 42). She was supposed to pass the finer fogs through a sieve before they came to earth. II. The Sea.-The god of the sea and of " all the waters " is Ahto :9 his wife is Vellamo. The former sails in a boat of water-lilies,'0 and lives in a castle at the bottom of the sea. He is represented as an old man with a long beard made of seaweed, and as wearing a mantle of foam. Vellamo wears a skirt of reeds, and is crowned with sedges. Ahto is lord of the inland lakes and rivers as well as of the sea itself ; hence the boat of water-lilies, which denote still-water. He is also king of the fishes that inhabit his realms. He is spoken of as being very wealthy owing to the treasures lost in wrecks which have accumulated at the bottom of the sea, and owing to the remains of the Sampo which fell into it. The sea was also the home of various water-nymphs and of mermaids, the latter being of the conventional kind. 6 J. Abercromby, Pre- and Proto-historic Finns, vol. i, p. 278.

Two water-pigmies are mentioned in the Kalevala; one cuts down the giant oak-tree for Vainamoinen," and the other assists the heroes when they are hunting for the fire-fish.'2 Possibly Vainamoinen himself was originally a water- spirit, since Vdind 13 signifies " still-water at the mouth of a river; "'14 in the Kalevala one of his epithets is " friend of waters." He was born in the sea (after 700 years of gestation), and lived in it for the first eight years of his life before setting foot on dry land. III. The Forests.-The god of the forests is Tapio, and his wife is Mielikki (the gracious) when she is propitious to hunters, or Kuurikki (the deaf) when she is not so. He is described as very tall and slender, as having a black beard, and as wearing a hat and coat of ermine or of tree-moss; she as being dressed in sky-blue and decked with scarlet ribbons when propitious, but as dressed in rags when unpropitious. Their son is Nyrikki, who builds bridges that the cattle may be able to pass to their summer-pastures over the morasses. He also cuts guide-marks on the trees for the benefit of hunters. Thus Lemminkainen prays:- " Notches make along the pathway ... That this hunter may not wander." 15 Tapio's daughter, Tulikki, also helps the hunter by driving the game for him with a rod of birch-wood, or in staying them by holding her hands before them. 11 Rune 2. 12 Rune 48. 13 cf. Dvina, (the Finnish name is VWna or Viina). (-moinen is merely a diminutive.) 14 The Ainu worship a " female possessor of places where fresh and sea-waters mingle," who watches over river mouths, and allows the fish to go in and out, (M. A. Czaplicka, Aboriginal Siberia, p. 274). 15 Rune 14. Comparable is Loitsu-runoja, ? 123 (k),-" Thou son of Tapio, Nyrikki, blue-mantled son of underwood, cut marks on rowan- trees, landmarks on mountain clefts by which my herd can go, my property can find its way."</page><page sequence="6">Notes on Bear-Worship among the Finns. 349 Tapio's abode is Tapiola or Metsola. Rune 14 of the Kalevala tells especially of the forests; there Lemmin- kainen hunts the moose, and prays to the various woodland deities to assist him. The Esthonian equivalent of Tapio has a long beard, and, like Odin, but one eye. Each tree has its special guardian deity, such as Pilayetar, the goddess of the mountain-ash, who is also a daughter of Tapio. " All trees," according to the Magic Songs, " were created by God," except the alder-buckthorn, the aspen, the rowan, the bird-cherry, the juniper, and the alder. These were made by evil under various names.'6 It is curious to find the rowan in this list, since this in Finland, as elsewhere, is a specially sacred tree, as is shown by the following passage : "In the yard there grows a rowan, Thou with reverend care should'st tend it. Holy is the tree there growing; Holy likewise are its branches, On its boughs the leaves are holy, And its berries yet more holy." In Scandinavian myth it is sacred to Thor (thunder) on account of its red berries. Its name rauni is a Scandinavian loan-word (Icelandic rynir, Sweden r6un), and Rauni was the consort of Ukko (thunder).17 Under the heading of forest deities also comes Hiisi, the " Devil " of the Kalevala. Presumably his having been relegated to this position indicates him as one of the oldest of Finnish deities. " Hiisi's land " is a name for the forest, and the corresponding Esthonian word Hiz still means a sacred grove. His connection with the forest is shown by his manufacturing 18 the moose for Lemminkainen to hunt there. The horse that breathes upon Marjatta at the birth of her son is called the " flaming horse of Hiisi," since the 16 Loitsu-runoja, ? 212 (i). 17 cf. J. Rendel Harris, Origin of the Cult of Dionysos, pp. 12-3. 18 A creator god.</page><page sequence="7">350 The Mythology of the Kalevala with stable where he was born was situated in the forest. In one of the Finnish riddles, the pine-tree is called " Hiisi's elk," or his " elk with the hundred horns." Besides being regarded as a woodland deity, he is sometimes a giant, and as such he is called by Bishop Agricola the " son of Kaleva." With the introduction of Christianity, he falls into disre- pute, and becomes the equivalent of the Devil. In this capacity he is the instrument of the wounding of Vaina- moinen's knee. Nightmares are called " Hiisi's dead," 19 and toothache is called " Hiisi's cat." Several variants of his name are found, such as Lempo, Piru,20 Juntas, and Jutas, which last is probably the same word as Judas.. He has a daughter 21 named Hippa, and a cat named Kipinitir, while his home is called after him, Hiitola. The horse seems to be connected with him. In the Magic Songs occurs the passage " from Hiisi is the horse's origin, from the mountain .. in a smithy with an iron ridge; its head was made of stone, its hoofs of rock, its legs were formed from iron, its back was made of steel." 22 As has been mentioned above, the bear was regarded as a woodland deity. In the Magic Songs the King of the Forest is prayed to stop his " bastard-son " from preying upon the suppliant's live-stock. If commands are not sufficient " to prevent the motion of his tongue, the quivering of his pointed nose, stick a mushroom up one nostril, and an apple up the other one," lest he should smell the cattle.23 Rune 46 of the Kalevala shows evidence of bear-worship among the Finns, and describes the procession and cere- 19 In the Magic Songs the sorcerer says he has " a sack below, a sack above," into which to gather nightmares.

He returns, with the bear, to the accompaniment of music. The skin is stripped off and spread on the floor,25 and the flesh cooked and eaten. A feast is held, to which Tapio and the woodland deities are invited, and songs are sung in honour of the bear. The " origin " of the bear is told; how a maiden walked in ether, with a satchel filled with wool and a basket filled with hair. These she threw into the sea ; the wind rocked them and brought them to shore. Mielikki wrapped them together and placed them in a cradle, which she rocked in the forest :-" Thus it was the bear was nurtured, and the furry beast was fostered." When he grew up he was given claws and teeth, having sworn on his knees to Mielikki, in the presence of Jumala, that he would work no evil with them. After the " origin " had been sung, Vainamoinen counted the bear's teeth and removed them. The body was finally disposed of in a tree " on a copper mountain's summit, .. . as a joy to men for ever, as a pleasure to the travellers," with the eyes turned towards the north-west. The bear is the king of beasts in the north, as the lion is in the south and in the countries which follow its traditions. Leems says, in his Account of the Laplanders of Finmark (1767), that " bears when killed have been brought home in a kind of triumph." 26 It would seem as if this custom obtained among all Arctic peoples, seeing that it is found also as far east as Kamchatka. This is shown in the follow- ing quotation :-" Having slain these three bears," says Count Benyowski in a passage in his memoirs, " we returned towards Csekawka. At the half distance we met the tajon (native chief) with twenty natives of Kamchatka : . . . when 24 This is the only trace of sacrifice in the Kalevala. 25 A bear-skin is used by the Ostyaks for kneeling upon when taking an oath. 26 Pinkerton's Travels, vol. i., p. 485-</page><page sequence="9">352 The Mythology of the Kalevala with they saw the dead bears, they sang our praise, and conducted us back in triumph. The first care of the Kamchatka men was to skin the bears, for which they gave us twenty-six martins' skins, and eight foxes' skins for the flesh." 7 With the Ainus, the bear is also supposed to partake of the feast, and they think that by partaking of the body and blood of their god, they may be brought into the closest possible communion with him.28 " The Finns," says Frazer, "used to try to persuade a slain bear that it had not been killed by them, but had fallen from a tree, or met its death in some other way." This was presumably so that its spirit might not haunt the slayer. So, in the Kalevala, Vainamoinen tells the people,-" With my spear I smote not Otso," but he himself " tumbled from the fir-tree's summit, and the branches broke his breast- bone." Similarly Batchelor says of the Ainu,-" A spear- man waits to be attacked. He keeps the point of his spear covered . .. and when the animal stands upon his hind legs to strike, he merely steps back a pace, and allows it to fall on the spear of itself." 29 When it has been killed, they worship it before skinning and cutting it up. Among the Lapps, the bones, together with the eyes, heart, and other parts, were kept after the feast and buried in a natural position, so that the slain bear might come to life again,-in the same way as the bones of Thor's goats were kept after the animals had been eaten, so that they might be resuscitated when the hammer of the god was waved over them. The Ainu " confessedly slays and eats the [bear] that another may come in its place, and be treated in like manner." 30 Women in Finland were not present at the bear-feast, and the bear might not be brought home by any path which a 27 Memoirs and Travels of Count Benyowski in Siberia, Kamchatka, etc., (1741-1771), P. 137, (1893). 28 J.

With the Yukaghir, a young unmarried girl must have no connection with a bear or other hunt, or the expedition will suffer from lack of food. She may not eat of the head or fore-part of the animal, or even look at its head.31 The bear-ceremony is most important among the Gilyak, and is held every winter in one or other of their villages. Sternberg says it plays as important a part with these people as did the Olympic games among the Greeks.32 The bear seems to have been regarded almost as a domes- tic animal, from the solicitude shown at its sacrifice. With this may be compared the account of the sacrifice of the ox in the third book of the Odyssey, and the wailing of Nestor's wife and daughters when the animal is struck. The ox was not an object of worship among the Greeks, but the sacrifice was " to renew the tribal bond with Pallas Athena in an extraordinary way." 33 Four versions of the " origin " of the bear are given in the Loitsu-runoja; of these the following is perhaps the most curious, owing to the mixture of Christian and pagan ele- ments in it. The bear was born " close to the moon, beside the sun, upon the shoulders of Otava (the Great Bear). From there he was let down to earth 34... to a verdant thicket's edge. A forest maiden 35 rocked him in a golden cradle, under a pine tree. The Virgin Mary acted as god- mother, and carried him to the christening. They named him " Hulking-fellow," " Lovely shaggy coat of hair," and " Honey-paws." "36 In Sweden the bear is called "Grand- 31 M. A. Czaplicka, op. cit., p. go. 32 M. A.

"The Yakut," says Shklovsky, speaking of the bear, " consider it a sin to pronounce his name, and speak of him as "Grandfather," or "he "."3 Similarly the Kamchadal, following the usual reluctance of primitive peoples in this respect, " venerated the bear and the wolf, and never pronounced the names of these animals." 38 In the Kalevala, as has been narrated, the bear has to swear to do no harm before he is given claws. A similar passage occurs in another of the Loitsu-runoja " origins ":. " There he swore his oath on the mother of Pohja's knee, before the well-known god, under the beard of the Blessed One, to do the innocent no harm, ... to walk in summer properly, to trudge along beseemingly, . . . shoeless to rove in summer-time, in autumn stockingless." 39 IV. The Dead.-The Finnish god of the dead is Tuoni 40 or Mana.41 He is represented as an old man, with but three fingers on each hand, and wearing his hat low down over his shoulders. This hat is comparable with the Greek " hat of darkness," which belonged to Hades. Tuoni's wife is Tuonetar (the deathland hostess), a horrible hag with iron teeth, who put Vainamoinen to sleep when he went to Tuonela. This pair have a son who is worthy of his parents. He appears twice in the Kalevala; it is he who chops Lemmin- kainen into fragments, and who tries to prevent Vaina- moinen's return to earth. His name is Tuonen-poika, and he is called the " rosy-cheeked," owing to his bloodthirsti- ness. Like his parents, he has but three fingers, of copper, 37 C. W.

Comparetti, however, says it comes from tuonne (there), and compares the Greek usage of oL ~dK for " the dead." 41 Manala is a shortening of maan ala (underground).</page><page sequence="12">Notes on Bear-Worship among the Finns. 355 on each hand. He is also squint-eyed and crooked-jawed. He is the father of snails by the daughter of Pain. Tuoni has three daughters. One is a dwarf,42 who ferries souls over the death-stream; a second is Loviatar, mother of the nine diseases ; the third is also a goddess of diseases, who sits on a rock in the death-stream under which they are imprisoned. Vana Sarvik (Old Hornie), the Esthonian equivalent of Tuoni, also has three daughters, and is possessed of a hat of invisibility, which is composed of nail-parings. Besides Tuoni there is another god of the dead who is mentioned in the Kalevala. This is Kalma (corpse-smell), who presides over the tombs. The Finnish belief seems to have been that the dead remained in the tombs, under the care of Kalma, until the body had decayed,43 and that they then passed on to Tuonela, after purification. Comparable is the Teutonic Nastr6nd, the " shore of corpses," as well as Helheim. Although Tuonela was conceived of as being underground, as in classical and Norse mythology, one would not expect this from the Kalevala description. To reach it, Vaina- moinen journeys for three weeks over meads and marshes, " Wandered for a week through bushes Through bird-cherry for a second, And through juniper the third week." 44 With this may be compared the account given by the Altaic shaman, during a s6ance, of his journey southward, which he is making to the underworld. " He has to cross the Altai mountains, and the red sands of the Chinese deserts. Then he crosses a yellow steppe, such as no magpie can traverse. "Singing we shall cross it," says the Kam (Shaman) in his song. After the yellow steppe there is a 42 Query of Lapp origin therefore. 43 The Samoyed believe that there is no future life after the decay of the body, except for the shaman. 44 Rune 16.</page><page sequence="13">356 The Mythology of the Kalevala with "pale " one, such as no crow can pass over.... Then comes the iron mountain of Tamir Shayha, which "leans against the sky." ... At last he comes to the opening which leads to the underworld. Here he finds a sea bridged only by a hair.... Only those who are blameless can cross this bridge." 45 According to another account one has to travel over nine and a half seas and a river full of whirlpools to reach Tuonela, but nowhere in Finnish mythology is any mention of the yawning and sulphurous mouths of hell of Greek myth. The Kalevala says but little of the circumstances of the dead when they reach Tuonela, and there is no mention of a marked division into Elysion and Tartaros. That it was regarded as a place of physical torment for the wicked, however, may be gathered from the words of Vainamoinen in his " sermon " to his people after his return thence :- " Evil are the wages paid one In the household of Tuoni. There is set the couch of sinners, There the bed of evil-doers, Under stones that burn for ever, Under rocks of glowing granite, With a coverlet of serpents, Of Tuoni's swarthy reptiles.46 For their drink the blood of adders, For their food the pangs of hunger, Pain and agony their solace; If thou wishest joy eternal, Shun the kingdom of Tuoni." But it would seem as if the good went there also, from three more lines : " There is ample room in Mana, There the worthiest must slumber, There must rest the good and evil." 45 M. A. Czaplicka, op. cit., p. 241, (quoting Potanin, Sketches of N. W. Mongolia).

The cult of the dead is the earliest known form of worship among the Finns, and rites at the tombs are continued to this day. Agricola says,-" Food was taken to the tombs of the departed, and there the people mourned." He also speaks of the feast of Kekri 47 (ghost), in their honour, which was held on Ist November.48 In the Kalevipoeg, Old Sarvik only allows the souls of the dead to revisit the earth on All Souls' Day, when they rush up in shoals.49 The Finns buried with their dead such things as they expected would be needed in the next world,-bows and arrows, sledges, snowshoes, and clothing. Various agricultural deities are mentioned in the Kalevala. Of these the most important is Sampsa Pellervoinen, the sower of the trees. The first part of his name has been said to be cognate with Sampo, which is also connected with fertility. Comparetti notes that " the Sampo runes were sung at the spring and autumn seed-time, as is still the custom in some places." 50 This deity, however, may belong to a late stratum, since his second name is said to be cognate with the German feld. Agricola mentions many agricultural deities of the Care- lians, and among them Virankannas,51 the protector of oats. '7 Also given by Agricola as the name of an agricultural deity, who causes cattle to multiply. 48 November is called the " month of the dead " in Finland as well as in England and Ireland. Among the Kamchadal there is only one great annual ceremony, and that is in November. For much interesting detail, see J.
