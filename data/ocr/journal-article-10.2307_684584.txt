<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sociological Forum, Vol. 5, No. 1, 1990 Review Essays Preface Charles Tillyl Museum directors differ from novelists and sociologists. They usually select the outstanding examples of objects within their domain, and present them in the most attractive light possible. There are exceptions; museums of the Holocaust, for example, build a sense of horror and despair at hu- man cruelty. But museums of painting never seek to display unbiased sam- ples of all the painting that has occurred in their chosen fields, folklore museums make it seem that country life shone with bright colors and polished tools, even geological museums set out the extraordinary, the well formed, the quintessential. Nor would most of us museum-goers want it otherwise; our everyday lives are too drab for us to want entertainments and diversions to be tedious and ordinary. So we delight in guides who can show us how to appreciate the vivid, vital, anthropomorphic, amusing, exception, puz- zling, illuminating, and beautiful features of the works on display. Guides themselves vary greatly in style, sometimes as a matter of muse- um intention, sometimes as a matter of personal idiosyncrasy. All of us have no doubt followed guides through rote declamation of an unvarying text - don't interrupt, or they will have to start again! - although that breed is declin- ing with the spread of the prerecorded teleguide. Occasionally guides tell us more about themselves than about the objets d'art on display; their taste, breeding, and experience become the object of exposition. But on the whole we expect good guides to show us how better to appreciate what we are see- ing, and how to link it more effectively to what we already know. Should we expect any less - or more - of a handbook purporting to sum- marize an academic discipline than we expect of a first-class museum? No doubt we can ask that it instruct us in how a particular part of the discipline operates, and tell us how to learn more, but that we ask of a museum as 'Center for Studies of Social Change, New School for Social Research, 64 University Place, New York, New York 10003. 121 0884-8971/90/0300-0121$06.00/0 ? 1990 Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">122 Tilly well. Surely we can hope it will be up-to-date, but many museums also face that requirement.Yes, a museum performs chiefly as a collective good and a book as an individual one, but the availability of prints, postcards, cata- logs, and private viewing blurs even that distinction. And handbook editors have a similar incentive to feature not the average, but the best. It is not fantastic to conceive of a disciplinary handbook as a museum devoted to the discipline, of our reading as a museum tour, and of reviewers as guides to the exhibits. We might think of Neil Smelser's latest contribution to the construc- tion and display of sociology, his massive Handbook of Sociology, as a muse- um, of us readers as motivated tourists, and of the Handbook's reviewers as museum guides. (I admit to a bit of pretense in identifying myself with the tourists, since a thorough tour of the premises would take us past an article Mark Granovetter and I wrote for the Handbook: let us simply avoid that obscure corner and pace off the other galleries.) How does the museum portray the discipline, and what do our guides pick out as vivid, vital, an- thropomorphic, amusing, exceptional, puzzling, illuminating, or lovely about sociological theory and practice? Especially as glossed by museum director Smelser, sociology comes across as a congeries of relatively distinct enterprises whose practitioners generally resist being subjected to categories and operating rules that span all the enterprises; we stroll from gallery to gallery and encounter surprising differences in the ways people define their problems, collect their evidence, analyze their material, and present the results of their work. (Even that defi- nition of what sociologists do, with its positivistic undertone, will not satis- fy many of the artists on display.) Despite the fact that Smelser implicitly screened his authors for their commitment to a relatively systematic and cu- mulative conception of the discipline -no intellectual anarchists here! -the specialties they portray vary greatly in abstractness, epistemological presump- tions, and methodological routinization. They range from the philosophical battleground in Andrew Scull's account of deviance and social control to the deeply empirical sociology of age outlined by Matilda White Riley, Anne Foner, and Joan Waring to the serenely abstract generalization of Jeffrey Alexander's New Theoretical Movement. Yet all this clustering and segregation operates within obvious limits. For the most part, the specialties represented in the Handbook correspond to the categories of folk sociology, the language of everyday intellectual con- versation about its subject matter: race and ethnicity, age, gender and sex roles, job and work, politics, families, education, religion, science, medi- cine, mass media, and so on. On the whole, they reflect distinctions that the people under study also apply to their lives, and other people's - either- so- cial structures or categories of the population. As a glance at the chapter</page><page sequence="3">Preface 123 headings in a standard textbook of anthropology, economics, psychology, or a fortiori biology will instantly demonstrate, that organization sets off sociology from other disciplines devoted to examining the human condition. On the whole, that correspondence of internal discourse to outside language results from sociologists' adoption of preexisting definitions rather than from their influence over the public vocabulary. Contrary to its sometime reputation as obfuscating and irrelevant to current affairs, furthermore, this peculiar discipline clearly responds with eagerness to new social trends and issues. The great bulk of the evidence and discussion in Janet Giele's 33 pages on gender and sex roles, for example, concerns change and difference in the United States since 1940. William Cock- erham's 25 pages on medical sociology draw somewhat more heavily on Eu- ropean observations, but still concentrate on the issues and trends of recent American medical experience. To be sure, the general chapters on sociologi- cal theory and method take up a number of questions that have no part in today's public discussion. Of course, when discussing social movements Doug McAdam, John McCarthy, and Mayer Zald explore such esoteric matters as macro- and microconditions for social movements. Yet even Parker Fris- bie and John Kasarda's abstractly titled "Spatial Processes," with its deliber- ate attention to abstract models, central-place systems, and Third World urbanization, devotes more than half its concrete discussion to land use and population distribution in postwar North American metropolitan areas. To an impressive degree, the events, controversies, changes, and evidence of re- cent American public life have shaped the sociology in Smelser's museum. Other museums, other views of the discipline: Sage published not one, but two handbooks of sociology in 1988. The second, Edward Borgatta and Karen Cook's The Future of Sociology, builds much more of an engineering museum - more buttons to push, more exhibits of how things work, more concern about practical applications of scientific principles -than Smelser's. In discussing family sociology, indeed, Rhonda Montgomery declares that We need not be engineers or architects, but we are the scientists on which such en- gineers and architects rely. If there are patterns and they are predictable, then we should find them. If we are afraid to do so, then we might better define ourselves as historians than as scientists. (Borgatta and Cook, 1988:117) Aside from the tendentious portrayal of historians as unscientific fact grub- bers, Montgomery conveys the tone of the Borgatta-Cook volume: confi- dent of sociology's ultimate ability to get the facts right and explain them, concerned about the field's evolution from a body of speculation to an em- pirically oriented set of inquiries to a world of (frequently impractical) war- ring factions, worried about the loss of lucrative support and enticing research opportunities to more enterprising researchers in adjacent disciplines, con-</page><page sequence="4">124 Tilly vinced that the cure for scientific anemia is more scientific blood. In the volume we find a discipline threatened not by internal dissension but by a failure to attach itself firmly to the questions and resources aimed in its direc- tion by an anxious public and its power holders. As a matter of fact, Smelser's introduction to the Handbook states some of the same concerns in a loftier way; he attributes the small political and financial support for sociological inquiry to many governmental officials' beliefs that "Research in the behavioral and social sciences produces trivial, obvious, and unimportant results ... is of no use to the government. . . is basically unscientific. . . in some branches of the behavioral and social sciences (such as the study of race relations, fundamentalist religious beliefs, family life, and other areas) is basically dangerous ideologically..." (Smelser, 1988:14). Even more so than Borgatta, Cook, and cohorts, however, he ar- gues that a justified claim to scientific status constitutes sociology's most solid defense against these criticisms, and therefore predicts - sociologists being at least as self-interested as other people -some form of scientism will pre- vail over the other contending ideologies within the discipline. He suggests, without quite making it explicit, that sociologists should take that advan- tage without letting it compromise their diversity and independence; let enough recognizable science flourish to pay the bills, then use the available leisure to pursue other interests. The difference between the two sociologi- cal museums, at least as understood by their directors, conforms to the con- trast between the Institute for Advanced Study and the Rand Corporation, between Harvard and Cal Tech, between the new Louvre and the Centre Pompidou. Different sets of guides to Smelser's museum point out different fea- tures, and thereby convey somewhat different ideas of what lies behind it. Under the editorship of Craig Calhoun and Kenneth Land, Contemporary Sociology has recently printed almost 40 pages of commentary on the Hand- book of Sociology. The dauntless duo point out that the publication of any handbook is "an exercise of considerable power," which therefore deserves collective monitoring by the affected profession (Calhoun and Land, 1989:475). To match the notoriety and diversity of the Handbook's authors, they enlisted Lewis Coser, Clifford Clogg, William Form, Jill Quadagno, Arthur Stinchombe, Walter Power, Jack P. Gibbs, Janet Abu-Lughod, James Short, Alan Sica, Hal Winsborough, and Kai Erikson-an extraordinary file of eminent scholars-to divide up the critical labor. Contemporary Sociology's guides speak in many tongues; no one could expect this band of individualists to describe the museum and what it represents in the same terms. Their editors, furthermore, gave them diver- gent assignments. While most authors ask how well various chapters represent the fields they know, for instance, Alan Sica takes on the assignment of com- paring the Handbook to many of its predecessors. [When I read Sica's report</page><page sequence="5">Preface 125 that Talcott Parsons' American Sociology, to which I contributed a chapter, had "chapters by many scholars now in the twilight of their careers but who then were the bedrock of the mainstream" (508), I confess to yearning for a cocktail of equal parts branch water, Geritol, and aspirin-the latter for mixed metaphor malaise.] Sica finds fault with the coverage of diverse theo- retical traditions, but with apparent mixed feelings, finds the new handbook better calculated to impress outsiders than the earlier efforts were. Hal Winsborough, on the parallel assignment of comparing the Hand- book to the Annual Review of Sociology, argues that Smelser's project or- ganizes around the integrated conception of society that used to prevail at Harvard, while sociologists of the Chicago school, including many editors of the Annual Review, commonly consider their subject matter to be "the collective life of humankind in all its variety" (510). And the inimitable Kai Erikson asks what image of sociology the Handbook conveys - the very ques- tion we are asking, however tortuously, here. Erikson's reply: In these ex- hibits, sociology looks like a very self-absorbed discipline, not much interested in analyzing what actually happens in human life or what real people care about. The critics do not always arrive at the same evaluations of particular showcases. Arthur Stinchcombe places the Charles Bidwell-Noah Friedkin essay on the sociology of education in the lower half of his rating scale, while Walter Power calls it "one of the highlights of the volume" (492). Although Jack Gibbs and Janet Abu-Lughod agree that Parker Frisbie and John Kasar- da misrepresent the actual state of knowledge about spatial processes, their critiques differ significantly, and they disagree substantially on Andrew Scull's treatment of deviance and social control; Abu-Lughod judges it "ingenuous but masterly" (498), while Gibbs opines that it "neither clarifies issues nor promotes their resolution" (495). So it goes through the guided tours. Although Contemporary Sociology's critics disagree among themselves more than the Handbook's contributors do, they converge on the conclu- sions that (1) sociology is much less exclusively or distinctively American than the Handbook says, and (2) it is also more connected and coherent. They reach the first conclusion through comparison of what they know of their own fields with the coverage of the Handbook's articles. They reach the se- cond conclusion negatively, through complaints about the absence of link- ing and synthetic statements; if the complaint is valid, such links and synthesis must now be possible. Judged from their commentaries, the Handbook of Sociology presents sociology as an archipelago of variously scientific special- ties, connected by occasional castaways, migrants, and raiding parties but resisting unification into a common community. For an unauthorized midnight tour of the same museums, I recruited three more distinguished scholars - Marvin Bressler, Barbara Laslett, and James Rule -to accompany me. They took my instructions faithfully: not</page><page sequence="6">126 Tilly to review the individual articles, not to worry about ranking and rating, but rather to let the stroll past the exhibits stimulate them to reflect on the state of sociology. Bressler decided to address what he detected as disguised despair, and as a recommendation to cut losses by playing Science, in Neil Smelser's general presentation of the volume. Barbara Laslett chose to stress how so- ciology as a whole had failed to absorb some of the most important advances of recent decades, the understandings of agency and consciousness that have developed in the study of gender, sexuality, culture, and emotions. James Rule took the Handbook as the text for skeptical ruminations on the claims to cumulative knowledge that constitute part of sociologists' self-definition as scientists. The sociology seen by these midnight observers comes out even more fragmented and conflict ridden than the images of sociology we exa- mined earlier. They evaluate that rancorous diversity differently; Bressler revels in it, Laslett lauds dissent but calls for synthesis, and Rule wonders whether the whole field is condemned to eternal strife and succession without progress. Read our authors, read the Handbook, and decide for yourself who, if anyone, has gotten the field right. REFERENCES Borgatta, Edgar F., and Karen S. Cook, eds. 1988 The Future of Sociology.
