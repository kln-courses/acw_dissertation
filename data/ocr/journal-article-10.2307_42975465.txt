<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rolling' the Epistemologica! f Dice "God does not play dice with the world," Einstein said early in his career, referring to the idea of orderly and knowable universe (Clark, 1971,38). The quote represents Einstein's epistemological position and his hope that despite his work, despite his unintended weakening of modern science, knowing in an assured way was still possible. Einstein's wish could not come true; with his work the postmodern breakdown of the logical order- ing of reason, the subverting of objectivity took root (Hutcheon, 1988, 74-75). Though he kept denying it, Einstein pushed us toward uncertainty. Einstein is a transitional fig- ure, a subversive member of the old regime, a reluctant vanguard of the new. EPISTEMOLOGICAL HISTORY: FROM PYTHAGORAS TO EINSTEIN TO CRITICAL POSTMODERNISM Creative innovation in physical and mathematical science traditionally has influenced society's epistemological perspective. In the ancient world the mathematical advances of the Pythagoreans made possible the development of rational deductive systems for num- bers and geometrical figures. Later, Plato described the nature of mathematical knowl- edge with his theory of ideas (or forms) that were precise, eternal objects of rational insight. Newton formulated modern "classical mechanics" that led to a certain knowl- edge of the physical world grounded in the mathematics of motion. Kant theorized a mathematical science of nature, arguing that space and time are a priori forms of sensi- bility, while substance and causality are a priori forms of understanding. When Einstein's relativity and quantum theory are thrown into the context, we can see that our way of</page><page sequence="2">78 Tke Stigma of Genius knowing is affected (Schlipp, 1949, 357-58). This chapter will analyze that effect and its implications for education. Knowledge has traditionally been viewed as objective. We all sought an ultimate truth. Aristotle maintained that through empirical deduction we could arrive at truth, conveniently ignoring the fact that he was the one dealing the cards from a stacked deck. (As in all games of chance, make sure you cut the cards.) Universal laws could be derived by working from the general to the particular: All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates is mortal (Courtney, 1988, 5). But in the last century these ancient ways of knowing have collapsed. Many have accept- ed the idea that there are a variety of ways of knowing. Two particular epistemological events in the early part of the twentieth century set the stage for the collapse. First, Bertrand Russell disrupted Aristotelian certainty by contending that the "All men are mortal" syllogism was simply a sentence. He substituted the sentence, "The King of France is bald." Russell argued that this sentence made no sense for two important reasons: 1 ) there was no current King of France; and 2) no King of France had been bald. Taking up where Russell left off, Ludwig Wittgenstein maintained that knowledge is gained in context. Employing the phrase criteria in context, Wittgenstein posited that knowing emerges in the relationship between: 1) using criteria that are rational; but are 2) in a specific context (Best, 1974, 17). This means that we use criteria that are ratio- nal for us (these criteria could differ between different individuals) and relate them to a particular context (Courtney, 1988, 5). Wittgenstein understood the concept of the stacked card deck. The second event, of course, was Einstein's theory of relativity and its destruction of the Newtonian-Cartesian notion that life and the cosmos worked like a machine. Emerging from the epistemological ashes of the mechanistic universe was Heisenbergs theory of indeterminacy, that the observer cannot be removed from the experiment. (Heisenberg also understood the need to cut the cards.) Quantum physics is based on this principle. From an epistemological perspective, classic objectivity does not exist; accuracy is possible only from a particular vantage point and a specific context. Indeed, what we know is merely our point of view. If our knowledge is to be logical, it must use rational criteria that are grounded in a particular context. Based on this understanding, Michael Polanyi's theory of personal knowledge emerged. Polanyi argued that scientific inquiry was similar to artistic creation. It was ground- ed not in empirical proof but upon personal belief. Reflecting Heisenberg's theory of indeterminacy, Polanyi contended that we all have a personal attitude, a unique relation- ship to what we know. But modern science is detached, he argued, and views its purpose</page><page sequence="3">Rolling tke Epistemologfical Dice 79 as the production of objective knowledge. Such an epistemologica! purpose is misguid- ed and holds dramatic implications for education. Polanyi was an avowed opponent of the founders of experimental psychology, psychologists who have shaped the nature of modern schooling. John Watson and B. F. Skinner took their epistemological models from what they considered to be the most objective and perfect science, physics. Unfortunately, the physics to which Watson and Skinner turned was Newtonian, not Einsteinian. Despite the fact that Einstein destroyed the objectivist, mechanistic orienta- tion of physics, the behavioral experimenters latched on to the old paradigm in their con- ceptualization of psychology. Knowing is not an objective process, Polanyi concluded; it is more "an intellectual commitment" (Courtney, 1988, 5-7). Polanyi's work was a very important force in the attempt to understand epistemology in light of the Einsteinian challenge. His conception of personal knowledge not only chal- lenged the Newtonian-Cartesian separation of the knower and the known, but also set the stage for the critical postmodern concept of knower participation in knowing. Slowly it became apparent that Newtonian-Cartesian epistemology contributed to an alienation from, and a depersonalization of, society. As we look around us at the beginning of the twentieth-first century, we see a human environment polluted by individuals who empiri- cally measure progress in short term profits, and government bureaucrats who measure progress more and more by their success in forcing individuals into conformity. The behav- iorism endemic to the epistemology has had no problem with the manipulation of individ- uals for desired ends. The educational system grounded in thtë way of seeing has molded students to foster efficiency and economic productivity at the expense of social concern, self-knowledge, meta-awareness, and creativity (Mahoney and Lyddon, 1988, 192). Teaching, unlike the classification of different acids, is not a constant and pre- dictable activity. It always occurs in a world of uncertainty. Thus, the definition of what knowledge teachers should possess is also uncertain. The question of how to teach teach- ers what to do in these conditions of uncertainty is even more elusive. But, guided by the Newtonian-Cartesian epistemology, schools of education were constructed so that the uncertainty of professional practice was scientifically eliminated and replaced with veri- fiable empirical knowledge about the act of teaching. The uniqueness of particular teach- ing situations was dismissed by educational scientists, whose clients demanded official knowledge. Challenges to the Newtonian-Cartesian view of knowledge produced too much anxiety. Science in the modern world has not existed to raise doubts. It was born to provide answers. Viewed in a larger historical context, the science of modernism replaced the religion of premodernism. The scientific method was substituted for church liturgy. Like religion, science sought the certainty of rules, orders, and structures to relieve the anxiety of not knowing (Schon, 1987, 11-13, 171).</page><page sequence="4">80 Tke Stigma of Genius The Newtonian-Cartesian quest for epistemological certainty assumed that the world was neat and tidy. In much the same way, Luther, Calvin, and Wesley produced religions that were neat and tidy. Knowledge could be produced far more easily if knowers were identical, unbiased, and infallible instruments of perception. From the epistemological perspective we could all see the world from the "correct" vantage point. Since we all operate from a similar place in the web of reality, what use is there for an analysis of the construction of our individual consciousness? The question of why we see the world as we do is irrelevant in the Newtonian-Cartesian landscape. The objectivist tradition pro- vides a shelter in which to hide from the deeply personal dimensions that inhabit all human actions and interactions; personal issues, which, if they were freed from the Newtonian-Cartesian box, might well force an uncomfortable element of self-revelation. Drawing on Polanyi's conception of personal knowledge, postmodern thinkers seek insight into how their own and other people's assumptions about the world are con- structed. Educators who do not understand themselves clearly will misconstrue the inten- tions and actions of others (Shweder and Fiske, 1986, 1-2). Thus, because of the post-Einsteinian world's breakdown of belief in a mechanistic cosmos, educators find themselves in a world characterized by an epistemological crisis. Social scientists and educators are faced with difficult questions for which they have no answer: What is the correct pathway to knowledge? What criteria do we use to produce knowledge? and What constitutes knowledge? As social and educational analysts have become more aware of the social and individual construction of knowledge, they have come to realize that knowledge produced by inquiry is quite specific to the method that is used. For example, a statistician and a critical educator will analyze a particular intelli- gence test differently. To the critical educator the test discloses a tacit set of unexplored social, cultural, and racial assumptions about not only the nature of intelligence but what knowledge is valued by the dominant society. To the statistician the test is valuable mea- suring instrument whose rank ordering of individuals or social groups relative to their intelligence is either quite similar or dissimilar to other intelligence tests; for the statisti- cian tests the thing , not the test taker. Depending on the observer's vantage point, the test is seen differently. Indeed, the epistemological crisis deepened because of the fact that the two observers of the intelligence test cannot even talk to one another. Einstein's challenge to the discipline of physics helped set off a chain reaction of events that has caused what Jürgen Habermas has labeled the dissolution of epistemolo- gy. After the birth of scientific thinking during the Enlightenment, modern inquirers ignored the study of the context that shapes the way we define knowledge. Within the modern worldview, epistemology dissolved into a circumscribed analysis of proper</page><page sequence="5">Rolling tke Epistemological Dice 81 research techniques. Any concern with the role of the knower faded away. Epistemology could not ask contextual questions about the assumptions behind knowledge or the cul- tural roles of science because empirical scientific knowledge was the only form of knowl- edge that was recognized as legitimate. No form of knowledge existed independent of sci- ence that would allow scientists to reflect on their methods and personal assumptions. The dissolution of epistemology involved the facing of the critical dimension of the study of knowledge. The critical epistemology that emerged from the Frankfurt School values the under- standing of the philosophical, historical, cultural, and political contexts in which knowl- edge is produced. At the same time an understanding of such contextualization is deemed to be important for professionals of all stripes. The act of reading, thus, is rev- olutionized by the application of critical epistemology, as the reader is aware of the con- text in which she or he reads and is able to uncover new dimensions of textual mean- ing: Where did the text originate? To whom is it addressed? For what purposes was it produced? What values does it promote? Who benefits as a result of its entry into the con- sciousness of its readers? Critical theory exposed the tacit dimensions of knowledge. No longer was knowledge as chaste and innocent as the Newtonian-Cartesian modernists portrayed it (Franker, 1986, 353-54; Howe, 1985, 14; Held, 1980, 254, 259; Eisner, 1983, 23). Feminist theory is the quintessential example of a critical epistemology. Feminist scholars begin with the assumption that knower and known are always historically situ- ated. Thus, feminist epistemology, or women's ways of knowing, transforms modern views of knowledge, forcing scientists and teachers to envision new relationships between the knower and the known. Knowledge is viewed from a postmodern perspective that attacks the modern deference to authority and science as power. The androcentric conception of a neutral, objective, hierarchical nonreciprocal interaction between knower and known is transcended by the feminist attempt to recon- nect the knower and known. As a result of this reconnecting, feminist theory allows the knower to prohibit science from blinding her or him intentionally, thus restricting what science can "see" in schools. Because they have exposed what can be ascertained from the mundane and the banal, feminist educators have reopened a whole new area to inquiry. These scholars have uncovered the existence of silences and omissions where modern educators had perceived only "what was there." Because they applied their own experience to the act of perceiving, women scholars were able to expose such omis- sions. Thus, they hitched knower to known (Fee, 1982, 383; Mies, 1982, 120-21; Belenky, Clinchy, Goldberger, andTarule, 1986, 19, 134).</page><page sequence="6">82 Tke Stigma of Genius Modern knowers, feminist epistemologists maintained, erased the self, "out rea- soned" their intuitions and inner voices, and ended up with nonspiritual objectivist per- ceptions of society and education. Using Newtonian-Cartesian definitions, modern know- ers saw objectivist perceptions as certain and scientific; feminist, self-grounded understandings were inferior, impressionistic, and simply journalistic. Not only were the feminist perceptions unscientific, unverified intuitions, but they were emotion-based and value-laden. The feminists became the first to realize that modern knowledge had released itself from any social or ethical responsibility. Objectivity in the Newtonian- Cartesian sense implied ideological passivity and an unquestioned acceptance of a privi- leged socioeconomic position. Modern objectivity demanded a separation of logic and feeling. Indeed, feeling was labeled an inferior form of human consciousness, thus pro- viding a rationalization for those knowers who rely on logic to oppress those conscious- ness associated with emotion or feeling. Feminist theories have maintained that the hier- archy of logic above emotion is one of the tacit structures historically used by men to dominate women (Reinharz, 1979, 242; Fee, 1982, 384-85). Feminist epistemology is an important facet of the cultural move from modernism to postmodernism. Challenging the notion of the superiority of male-centered Western culture, feminist theory exposed the particularity of the allegedly universal truths that ground Eurocentric society (Giroux, 1991, 23-24). In this context feminist epistemolo- gy led Western thinkers to reconsider the value of non-Western epistemologies that in the past had been demeaned or ignored. Afrocentric and Native American ways of knowing are very similar to the anti-Cartesian perspectives of Polanyi. Although we wish to avoid a simplistic romanticization of indigenous ways of knowing, we can learn from these "primitive" epistemologies and their refusal to separate reality. In these "primitive" epis- temologies, or subjugated knowledges, reality has never been separated into spiritual and material parts. Self-knowledge serves as a grounding for all knowledge in most African and Native American epistemologies. Interpersonal relations and group solidarity, as well as respect for the individual, are viewed as important, and diunitary logic has moved these cultures to treasure the unity of spirit and matter, individual and world (Semali and Kincheloe, 1999). The Eurocentric Newtonian-Cartesian worldview and these indigenous ways of knowing come into direct conflict over epistemological issues of mind and body, humans and nature, self and other, spirit and matter, and knower and known. These con- flicts have had serious historical consequences. Thus, that which traditionally has been viewed by Western scholars as primitive becomes, from the perspective of postmodern critical constructivist epistemology, a valuable source of insight in the attempt to define a more just and equitable form of knowledge (Myers, 1987, 73-75; Nyang and Vandi, 1980, 245).</page><page sequence="7">Rolling the E pis temolo gical Dice 83 Through our synthesis of the Einsteinian epistemological challenge, feminist notions of knowing, and indigenous peoples' subjugated knowledge, we ground our attempt to envisage a theory of knowledge that is capable of confronting a postmodern cosmos. From this critical postmodern vantage point we gain the ability to question the so-called "knowledge base" of the social sciences and education. Our critique allows us to for- mulate new ways of knowing and alternative strategies of inquiry in our work as educa- tors. We have entered a new social and educational dimension, a terrain of uncertainty where the Newtonian-Cartesian rules do not always apply, where the separation of mind and matter is not simply assumed, where multiple ways of knowing are sought and val- ued (Poster, 1989, 30). As we begin our epistemological journey into this postmodern realm, we come to realize that the voice of authority, of rational man , is no longer a universal voice. Such a realization allows us to begin the task of deconstructing the assumptions of Newtonian- Cartesian logic and the "common sense" of the schools. It allows us to see inside the way that traditional science fabricates an imaginary world. Like any story, science is com- posed. Indeed, like a story, it is a language game. As we come to ask who made the rules of the game, we see that the "truth" of the Western tradition is another narrative that often has served to erase or at least ignore the stories, cultural traditions, and ways of knowing of those who, because of race, class, gender, and economics, constitute the "other." Thus, the Western patriarchy and ethnocentrism, so vehemently denied by defenders of the faith, are coaxed from the shadows. We see the ways that school knowledge privileges the Western canon and in the name of objectivism protects Western society and tradition from a genealogical analysis of its historical formation and from social criticism in general. A critical postmodern epistemology not only exposes the shadow values, assump- tions, and forms of prevailing notions of social and school knowledge, it also produces new concepts of knowledge. New meanings, new ways of knowing emerge from the breakdown of traditional assumptions about schooling. We begin to see forms of study that were ignored and knowledge that was unrepresented in the old school. Based on these epistemological understandings, postmodern educators maintain that learning begins only when the knowledge of school is grounded in the tacit knowledge that stu- dents bring to the classroom. Thus, knowledge of media, music, and popular culture is treated as a legitimate form of knowledge by critical postmodern educators. This is very different from the curriculum necessitated by a Newtonian-Cartesian epistemology, a curriculum that simply transmits the isolated knowledge of the disci- plines. The critical postmodern teacher attempts to integrate the knowledge of the disci- plines in the context created by a set of projects chosen in consultation with students. Many commentators have simplified and distorted the spirit of the critical postmodern</page><page sequence="8">84 The Stigma of Genius school by charging that it merely substitutes the study of popular culture for the study of traditional disciplines. Schools that are based on a postmodern epistemology demand that knowledge meet the test of a reconceptualized notion of relevance. This critical notion of relevance does not imply a rejection of tradition but does demand a standard for deciding what is included in the curriculum. At this point the teacher attempts to con- vince students that these reconceptualized knowledges are valuable. They give students the ability to learn what they want to know. The Great Tradition, the Western canon, is not taught as a self-evident source of superior knowledge. As with any other knowledge, stu- dents and teacher use their critical epistemology to determine the origins and question the assumptions of a literary work, a historical viewpoint, or an approach to science or math (Giroux, 1991, 24; Giroux and Aronowitz, 1991, 15-16). EINSTEIN S CLASSICAL INTENTIONS Despite the epistemological avalanche triggered by his work, Einstein remained true to many goals of classical (or modern) science. Like Newton before him, Einstein believed that reality corresponds to physical laws. These laws, he maintained, are objective and exist separately from any particular knower or observer. Although his theory of relativity told us that different observers see different events, it still operated in the confines of a Newtonian-Cartesian epistemology. Einstein thought it brought us closer to understand- ing the objective laws of the cosmos (Peat, 1990, 680). Nothing nonphysical causes anything, Einstein concluded. His cosmic reverence required no nonphysical structure of reality. Indeed, his awe involved speculation about the order and harmony that was omnipresent in physical reality (Morrison, 1987, 54). Thus, physical reality for Einstein clung to a Newtonian absolutism in that if the inquir- er's mode of inquiry was properly scientific, laws would be forever immutable. This from the harbinger of the postmodern age, from the father of relativity? The irony was not lost on Einstein; he himself suggested that special relativity should have been known to the world as the theory of invariance (Jaki, 1987, 10). Ever the ambiguous, amphibious one, half in the modern water, half on the strange postmodern land, Einstein clung to a Newtonian-Cartesian belief in a reality "out there," independent of how we decide to study it. The universe was still rational, predictable, and ruled by tangible, predetermined, and universal laws (Jaki, 1987, 10; Penrose, 1991, 37; Burich, 1987, 23). If one detects a hint of determinism in Einstein's epistemology, he or she is probably correct. Indeed, he argued that everything was determined by larger forces over which humans exert no control. Insects, stars, vegetables, and humans all dance to a mysterious tune played by an invisible piper (Burich, 1987, 230).</page><page sequence="9">Rolling the Epistemologfical Dice 85 While it is true that, after the theory of relativity, time and space could not be viewed in the same way, Einstein never attempted to destroy absolutism when he maintained that no single frame of reference was privileged. To Einstein, this simply meant that all natur- al laws must retain their freedom from any particular vantage point so that absolute laws that are valid in every situation and every observation can be formulated. Such a formu- lation saves our epistemological souls, protecting us from the chaos, the "hell" of a rel- ativists pluralism of reality constructs based on every observer's experience. Sustained by his "faith" in the rationality of the universe, Einstein in one sense attempted to free science from its egocentric and anthropomorphic blinders (i.e., its observer relativism; its dependence on different frames of reference) as he moved to a higher objectivity with his principle of invariance. In retrospect it is easy to see that his definition of rationality remained within the boundaries of the Newtonian-Cartesian way of seeing (Burich, 1987, 22). Theoretical physics would eventually force us to consider a variety of ways of seeing, an alternative set of geometries that were rational in the clas- sical sense (Gangadean, 1987, 89-90). However, though committed to an absolutist sci- ence, Einstein opened the door to the stranger of epistemological pluralism. This myste- rious stranger proceeded to ignite a revolution that in the late twentieth century is still burning, just not beginning to singe the hair of the "laity." As it links up with the subver- sive spirit of postmodernism, the epistemological world as we know it will be destroyed by fire. QUANTUM PHYSICS- THE REAL EPISTEMOLOGICAL OUTLAW Einstein reluctantly developed perhaps the most unfortunate label in the history of physics, relativity. Maybe sameness or invariance would have been more appropriate descriptions. To Einstein, the theory of special relativity only gave the appearance of a cosmos in which all observations are relative 0aki, 1987, 9; Morrison, 1987, 52). Thus, relativity in the context of epistemology is not the most radical aspect of Einstein's work. The symbol of relativity is more important to epistemology than its reality. Quantum physics, the study of matter at the subatomic level, developed by Max Planck and extended by Einstein, disallowed a conception of reality that was consistent with the common sense of the everyday world. Among other disquieting characteristics they found that subatomic particles have a wavelike nature, meaning that it is inaccurate to speak of them as existing in a particular place. When a bullet is shot from a gun, for example, Newtonian physics and common sense tell us that we can measure both the bul- let's speed and its location to chart its trajectory. The news from quantum physics was that we can't do this with subatomic particles such as electrons. Trajectory, thus, cannot be conceptualized in the quantum realm. Physicist John Wheeler characterizes subatomic</page><page sequence="10">86 Tke Stigma of Genius particles as great smoky dragons whose heads and tails we can find, but whose bodies are lost in a thick fog (Talbot, 1986, 17). What is more amazing at the quantum level is that depending on what types of questions we ask about the dragons, we get entirely different answers, completely different pictures of what they look like. This realization led Werner Heisenberg to his theory of indeterminacy, the idea that the inquirer is an inseparable part of the inquiry that laid the epistemological foundation for quantum physics. Heisenberg argued that classic objectivity does not exist. Accuracy is possible only from a particular vantage point (Courtney, 1988, 5). The amazing implications of quantum physics forced quantum physicists, Niels Bohr in particular, to develop a formal reconceptualized epistemology. Their Copenhagen interpretation, or quantum epistemology, theorized what could be known about the sub- atomic microcosm. Connecting observer to the observed, Bohr and his colleagues refused to talk about atoms and electrons, that was not what they were observing. Thus, quantum epistemology delved into the irrational in nature. We must accept the irrational, the Copenhagen physicists argued, for when we try to ignore it and build rational pictures or models of the quantum world, the classical ideas of Newtonian physics slip in to dis- tort it. What then is quantum reality? Bohr said that there is no quantum world, only an "abstract quantum mechanical description" (Peat, 1990, 64-65). EINSTEIN, THE GUARDIAN OF EPISTEMOLOGICAL TRADITION? Although he was responsible for some of the initial ideas that led to quantum physics, Einstein considered the Copenhagen description to be epistemological defeatism. Drawing upon his classical Newtonian roots, Einstein posited that if quantum physics doesn't grant us a realistic perspective on events at the subatomic realm, no matter how strange it might be, then the theory is insufficient. Using the logic of modernism, Einstein thus rejected quantum physics as a theoretically inadequate description of submicroscopic phenome- na. Employing his frequently used dice metaphor, Einstein wrote in 1926: The theory produces a good deal but hardly brings us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I am at all events convinced that He does not play dice (Quoted in Penrose, 1991, 37). In addition to his problems with the realism of the quantum description, Einstein also was offended by quantum theory's subjectivity. There must be something yet undis- covered in the subatomic world to account for our observation of it, he maintained. Acting in his role as guardian of tradition, Einstein was not ready to let Bohr and his quantum colleagues pull the epistemological carpet out from under him. O. B. Hardison Jr. described Einstein's guardian role as more like that of a chess player than that of a</page><page sequence="11">Rolling the Epistemologfical Dice 87 craps shooter; he never accepted that an objective world of time and space did not exist at the quantum level (Hardison, 1989, 49). Uncomfortable in his new role of the caretaker, the guardian, Einstein argued that eventually a discovery would uncover a more comforting and classical level of reality, an objective description of location and trajectory. He wrote: Even the great initial success of the quantum theory does not make me believe... although I am well aware that our younger colleagues interpret this as a consequence of senility. No doubt the day will come when we will see whose instinctive attitude was the correct one (Quoted in Talbot, 1986, 27). For the rest of his life Einstein attempted to disapprove quantum physics. In the minds of most avant-garde physicists his attack was grounded on one fatal flaw. Without question, he assumed the existence of a physical and objective reality (Talbot, 1986, 27). Einstein never strayed from his firm belief in scientific objectivity. Scientific objec- tivity, as Einstein conceived it, set forth a reality that: 1) is permanent despite any indi- vidual's inability or refusal to recognize it; 2) is material, physical, and external to the human mind; 3) is ordered by invariant universal laws. Thus, Einstein was grounded in a traditional epistemological realism, instead of a naiVe realism, since the truths of the physical world were not merely derived from sensory experience but were formulated as constructions of the scientific imagination. The fact that the imagination was utilized, however, did not disturb Einstein's equation of objectivity with the constancy of physical laws , not physical observations. For example, an observer on a speeding train may describe the path of a falling basketball in terms of a parabola; an observer on the ground describes the path as a straight line. To Einstein the realist, these differences in descrip- tion were irrelevant as long as the physical law expressed as a differential equation remained the same for both observers (Morrison, 1987, 52-53). THE INTERSECTION OF AVANT GARDE PHYSICS WITH POSTMODERNISM Einstein remains an ever-paradoxical figure. Firmly grounded in traditional epistemolo- gy, his work and spirit laid the foundation for dramatic changes in the way we consider knowing. Many of the dramatic changes in late twentieth-century physics have emanated from the mind of David Böhm. Born to the generation that followed Einstein, Böhm came to know him in the last year of Einstein's life. A series of conversations with Einstein at Princeton in the early 1950s alerted Böhm to the possibilities of a physics beyond the quantum. Drawing upon a foundation constructed by his deep understanding of quantum theory, Einstein's insights, and his own insightful creativity, Böhm developed a series of theories that have pushed physics to a new dimension at the same time that they have</page><page sequence="12">88 Tke Stigma of Genius expanded our social and epistemological imaginations (Peat, 1990, 146-48). While many have contributed to the avant-garde physics of the late twentieth century, we will focus upon Bohm's work as representative of the cutting edge of the discipline. The fol- lowing ten points offer a beginning for those interested in the educational implications of the conjunction of physics and postmodernism. The universe as an undivided whole: Nature cannot be analyzed as if it WERE A CONGLOMERATION OF PARTS. Böhm argues that although science uses the lan- guage of holism, science has in practice studied the physical world as if the fragments explored under microscopes and accelerated in particle chambers were actual reality. Drawing on the ideas that would form the basis of his notion of implicate order, Böhm called for an examination of reality that sought the enfolded connections among events. Bohm's ideas thus emphasized the flux and flow, the stages of events; not simply the event itself (Böhm and Peat, 1987, 197-98; Briggs and Peat, 1984, 98). Postmodernism, like Bohm's physics, has decried the fragmentation of Newtonian- Cartesian epistemology. Human and social experience has been reduced, postmodernists argue, to discrete and arbitrary pieces that are separated from the combination of forces that provided the human experience its distinction in the first place (Britzman, 1991, 35). Newtonian-Cartesian love, for example, involves a raised heartbeat, a specific percentage increase in hormonal secretion, and a behavioral expectation of positive reciprocation. Modern curriculum is removed from the social realities that grant significance to the knowledge to be "mastered." Indeed, modern schools see society as one cog of a larger machine that is to be studied. Postmodernists see human beings and society as intercon- nected aspects of a broader framework, an implicate order, that reveals itself when the evolutionary possibility of humanity is entertained (Oliver and Gershman, 1989, 30). Transcendence of dominant, certified ways of seeing: Scientists and educa- tors AS COGNITIVE CARTOGRAPHERS. Böhm has maintained that to take wholeness seri- ously is to give up all that is familiar and comfortable about our understanding of the physical world. In other words, Böhm is asking us to step through the postquantum look- ing glass to the other side of the mirror. For example, Böhm and others have recognized that quantum systems are related in a manner that insults the traditional explanations of Newtonian-Cartesian physics. At the subatomic level, processes are connected in ways that have nothing to do with commonsense conceptions of fields, pushes, pulls, waves, particles, or direct or indirect correlations. Dominant ways of seeing have nothing to do with such disconcerting quantum processes. For example, correlations between particles in different locations are often instantaneous and do not require intercommunication. Labeled nonlocality, such interactions (or non-interactions) are irrational from a Newtonian-Cartesian perspective. The time has come for a deconstruction and redefini-</page><page sequence="13">Rolling the Epistemological Dice 89 tion of the term "rational" (Böhm and Peat, 1984, 99; Peat, 1990, 130). The process of redefinition may bring us to a level of understanding of physical reality that opens doors only imagined by science fiction writers. Drawing upon the postmodern analysis of Frederick Jameson, Henry Giroux and Stanley Aronowitz take the idea of transcending familiar ways of seeing into the social and educational realism. The postmodern critique alerts us to the dominant ways in which social reality is "mapped" and thus gives us the power to formulate new cognitive maps that take into account the unique conditions created by new electronic and information- al technologies. In many ways the socioeducational space created and occupied by tele- vision, mass advertising, computer technology, music videos, video games, and the like is as uncomfortable and as unfamiliar as the microspace "described" by quantum physics. The postmodern "creation of new constellations of forms," that is, the rewriting of our lives and the ways that we represent ourselves is similar to the attempt of avant garde physics to rewrite our understanding of physical reality (Aronowitz and Giroux, 1991,60-61). Theory construction as means to insight, not as begetter of absolute KNOWLEDGE AND TRUTH! THE DEVELOPMENT OF A POST-EPISTEMOLOGICAL SCIENCE. Böhm is quite concerned about producing insights into the physical world. An insight, he argues, is not a rigid truth but an act of perception, a new angle on the "wholeness." An insight might involve a poet's ability to connect individuals to an empathetic flash about the taste of sorrow, not a definitive treatise on the topic. Knowledge of sorrow is transitory. Each time we experience it we find ourselves in new circumstances. The taste in the new con- text is slightly different and we slowly understand the feeling in subtly different ways. Advantages can be gained from giving up the traditional epistemological quest for final knowledge. The post-epistemological scientific world emphasizes the delicate, ever- shifting nature of relationships between physical objects; the undivided nature of reality, not the individual pieces of our existence. Seen from a Newtonian-Cartesian perspective, the heart is undoubtedly not the brain on one level; but on another, more subtle, plane, there is no way to separate the function of the two organs. Indeed, to separate them is to lose insight into the genesis of heart function and disease (Briggs and Peat, 1984, 97-98). Jean-François Lyotard maintains that the postmodern world is an environment in flux, a social cosmos where the epistemological certainties of the past have been destroyed by technical and scientific innovation (Lyotard, 1984, 80). Thus, individuals must steer their own courses and develop their own insights without the guidance of val- idated benchmarks, unquestionable philosophical assumptions, or universal definitions of reason. Knowledge is constantly changing in the postmodern world as the pace of</page><page sequence="14">90 Tke Stigma of Genius social change in general accelerates to a dangerous speed. Newtonian-Cartesian mod- ernism attempted to control the changes by stepping outside of history, developing per- manent fixtures of truth, and using them to produce discursive closure, in an end to his- tory and an end to conversation (Hutcheon, 1988, 101). Postmodernism operates from within history, knowing that present circumstances will change (probably tomorrow), and that history cannot be escaped. Postmodern educators, thus, understand that no cur- riculum is final, no canon sacrosanct. There is always tomorrow in the postmodern world. Stretching beyond mechanistic ways of seeing: The coming collapse of the Newtonian-Cartesian world. Most scientists continue to practice their craft as if the mechanistic worldview had never been questioned. They do not see that agent provoca- teur, quantum physics, already has performed its subversive task with aplomb; it has sown the seeds of ruination for Newtonian-Cartesian mechanistic fragmentation. Quantum physics showed that the concept of separate atomic particles cannot be main- tained and previously validated fragmented of reality have lost their definition as discrete entities that exist in time and space. As the result of quantum analysis, physicists' pictures of individual subatomic particles have blurred into post-impressionistic portraits of ill- defined clouds (Briggs and Peat, 1984, 100-01). The Newtonian-Cartesian master narratives and mechanistic ways of seeing are also crumbling in the social sciences, humanities, and education. In Western philosophy post- structural, critical, and feminist perspectives have raised challenges to tradition via ques- tions of ethics and justice. Critical theory is, in a sense, the quantum physics of social the- ory because it reframes our postmodern picture of fragmented social and educational reality. Foucault, Derrida, Lyotard, Habermas, and Baudrillard have successfully chal- lenged the empiricist assumptions (the metanarratives) of science and other cultural sys- tems. As they challenged the epistemological authority of consensus, they exposed the illusion of consensus. They tapped into the ways of seeing of the marginalized and the dispossessed from the subjugated perspectives of those groups. They found the impor- tance of the master narratives: that social reality and educational practice are structured by discourses (what can be said about particular subjects, who can say it, and who must listen), and that the discourses are shaped by the master narratives as well (Hutcheon, 1988, 6-7; Giroux and Aronowitz, 1991, 19). The INSEPARABILITY OF OBSERVER AND OBSERVED. After quantum theory, the assumption that the observer and that which he or she observes constitute discrete parts of the universe cannot be supported (Briggs and Peat, 1984, 99). Of courses, the ques- tions we ask about quantum reality shape the picture of the subatomic cosmos that we paint. Our location in the web of reality, our vantage point, influences our questions.</page><page sequence="15">Rolling tke Epistemological Dice 91 Thus, to remove the knower from the object of study is to distort the process of know- ing. Postmodernism is grounded in this constructivist conception of the inseparability of the knower and the known, it transforms the "givers" of modernism into the "construc- tions" of postmodernism. Thus, while reality may exist, it is molded by the discourses, concepts, and categories of human interpretation. Many have taken such an assertion to mean that the world is meaningless. Why should social scientists and educators even attempt to perform their tasks? Postmodernists respond that constructivism does not imply meaninglessness, it only implies that any meaning that remains to be found is cre- ated by us ourselves (Hutcheon, 1988, 43, 146). Such an understanding holds dramatic implications for the ways that we inquire and teach. It grants us a critical distance that allows us to uncover that which was hidden by the assumptions of certainty, the ironies, the ambiguities, the intentions that shape what we have become. The inseparability of whole and part: Abandoning the idea of a rigid body FOR THE NOTION OF "WORLD TUBE." To Böhm, structures of reality are parts of larger flowing movements, like a vortex in a stream. Einstein initiated the concept with his idea that there are no Newtonian rigid bodies existing absolutely in space and time, only rel- ative ones. In the place of rigid bodies, Einstein introduced the idea of a world tube or the history of a region of space. Einstein's world tube rejects the notion of the particle as smallest unit of physical analysis and implies that matter was best conceived as a process, as an interaction of whole and part. Indeed, where does the river end and the vortex begin? Of course, there is no way to tell because physical reality is an infinitely complex, rationally unanalyzable continuous process (Böhm and Peat, 1987, 72: Briggs and Peat, 1984, 62, 101). In the same way that avant-garde physics subverts the notion of the unified or rigid particle as the smallest coherent unit of analysis in the physical universe, postmodernism subverts modernism's notion of the free, coherent, transcendent, unified individual (or subject). The idea of a free, coherent individual is grounded in an acceptance of a ratio- nal, self-determining consciousness that is free from any type of consciousness-construc- tion. Postmodernism contends that human subjects gain their "subjectivity," their meaning in the world, through their social relations. Thus, the human subject is shaped by multi- ple and contradictory forces. The self is no longer a simple warehouse for consciousness. It is a site of the ambiguous pushing and pulling of a multitude of influences. As with a vor- tex, it is hard to determine where human consciousness ends and social and discursive acts begin. THE INSTABILITY OF LANGUAGE! SCIENTIFIC LANGUAGE IS THE PROGENY OF THE Newtonian-Cartesian WORLD. We must talk, David Böhm argues, but we must remem- ber that our words are never about absolute things. At our best we express insights. At</page><page sequence="16">92 Tke Stigma of Genius our worst, we communicate illusions. Quantum theory, for example, undercuts our com- placency about the meaning of words such as "path." It is not that the electron's path is uncertain. It is the linguistic use of path in this context that doesn't work. Echoing Wittgenstein, Niels Bohr often reminded his colleagues that reality is just a word in the particular word game of science. Drawing upon Bohm's theory of enfolded order, we can see that all science is grounded in a language that is designed only to describe the expli- cate order. Thus, language is a prisoner of the Newtonian-Cartesian wardens. What we can conceptualize is significantly limited by the failure of language to keep up with new dimensions of reality (Briggs and Peat, 1984, 103; Peat, 1990, 45, 69, 157). A central tenet of postmodernism involves its description of the instability of lan- guage. Frames of reference seem to be a matter of systems of description or discursive rules rather than of that which is being described. Language, thus, does not possess a fixed and absolute correspondence to reality. The individual's construction of meaning, as a result, is freed from the confines of traditional usage by this postmodern under- standing. We are empowered to see that the meanings that are considered most legitimate are significantly determined by power groups who exert influence over the economic and cultural workings of a culture (Hutcheon, 1988, 145; Aronowitz and Giroux, 1991, 92-93). Indeed, one of the tragedies of any absolutist, feminist, or other essentializing school of thought, is that having accepted the need to free language and thinking from its Newtonian-Cartesian constraints, some wish to immediately place a new set of constric- tive meanings upon society. The wholeness of the universe cannot be captured by one grant theory: There is always another vantage point from which to question reality. Each time in the history of science we arrive at a point at which a particular paradigm fails to pro- vide consciousness-expanding, meaningful answers, we have reached an epistemological watershed. In effect what happens during this period of dissonance is that we discover a deeper wholeness to the cosmos than we had ever before anticipated. The holistic nature of reality extends far deeper than our maps, theories, or equations ever portrayed it. Martin Heidegger once provided an insightful example that attempted to illustrate the dif- ficulty of finding one description that captures the wholeness of reality. Comparing truth to a drinking glass, Heidegger explained that as one rotates the glass to see one particu- lar aspect, another aspect is concealed. The glass, he concluded, can never be positioned in a manner that allows one to see the whole glass. Whatever one sees of the glass, how- ever, contains its wholeness within it. From a previously unconsidered angle we may see another dimension of the wholeness (Briggs and Peat, 1984, 103). "Let us declare war on totality; let us be witnesses to the unpresentable," Lyotard wrote, in an attempt to reflect the postmodern notion, that wholeness cannot be captured</page><page sequence="17">Rolling tke Epistemological Dice 93 by one grand theory (Lyotard, 1984, 82). Within the socio-educational domain, post- modernism rejects attempts to delineate an essential transhistorical human nature, a fixed theory of intelligence or ossified stages of cognitive development, or the correct human goals that must be pursued. Typically, such totalities wrap themselves in the ban- ner of objectivity and scientific disinterest, thus freeing themselves from a distasteful debate. The postmodern attack on totality is offered in the attempt to deflate an authori- tarian epistemological machismo, replacing it with a diversity of perspectives and voices. The stories of the subjugated that emerge from particular historical struggles offer new perspectives on the wholeness of society, perspectives that allow us to see Heidegger's glass from new angles (Aronowitz and Giroux, 1991, 67-70). The inability of old orthodoxies to name the changes that are propelling US INTO THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY. Newtonian-Cartesian physics assumes that we live in a world in which the scale of size and energy is taken for granted. The quantum world in Newtonian terms is an irrational land of mystery, a funhouse of mirrors, where objects instantly transform themselves from particles into waves, entities "walk" through two doors at once, and "distant relatives" use the telephone whenever communication is needed. The Mad Hatter and Door Mouse reign supreme. Physicists have been baffled by the action of subatomic particles and their ability to maintain a "nonlocal" connection that has nothing to do with space or time. Newtonian-Cartesian concepts have little rele- vance for such a terrain (Peat, 1990, 132; Kincheloe, 1998; Kincheloe, et al. 1999). The postmodern condition that is marked by a media-propelled landscape of con- sumerism is a cosmos markedly different from the world into which the modern physi- cal and social scientific disciplines were born. In the postmodern world, political and consumer discourses merge into a grammar of manipulative images. Postmodern cri- tiques assume that such unprecedented conditions cannot be understood within the framework of modernism (Hutcheon, 1988, 205, 210). One of the few chances we have to escape the torturous possibility of falling deeper into the pit of mindless consumerism and objectivism is to understand the postmodern analysis of power relations within texts, codes, and cultural signs, indeed, within curricula and school definitions of success. Like Newtonian-Cartesian scientists, the attempts of traditional liberals and conservatives to explain the power relations of the postmodern world are inadequate. Indeed, postmod- ern epistemology gives us a chance to go beyond, to explain what has traditionally elud- ed us: to explain the construction of the conscious operation of power, the ways that our schools unwittingly promote particular views of reality and self (Kincheloe, Steinberg, and Gresson, 1996).</page></plain_text>
