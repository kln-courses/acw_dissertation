<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> James Robson BRUSHES WITH SOME “DIRTY TRUTHS” : HANDWRITTEN MANUSCRIPTS AND RELIG ION IN CHINA Catherine Bell is best known to scholars outside of the study of Chinese reli- gions as a perceptive reader and interpreter of ritual theory, for her studies of the category of “belief,” and for her innovative approaches to religious studies as a discipline.1 Yet, in her Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice she claimed that it all began with her doctoral work in Daoist studies and that the “problems and issues engaged” in that book “were first formulated for a dissertation chap- ter.”2 Among Sinologists and scholars of Asian religions she is appreciated for the service she provided by reviewing—often in the pages of this journal— influential new works on Chinese Daoism and “popular religion,” although those essays were more ambitious than mere “reviews,” since they raised key methodological issues that helped move the field forward.3 Her focused and 1 See, e.g., Catherine Bell,Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice (NewYork: Oxford University Press, 1992), Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions (NewYork: Oxford University Press, 1997), “Perfor- mance,” in Critical Terms for Religious Studies, ed.

One of the topics that surfaced again and again in a number of her essays, such as her “Printing and Religion in China,” which inspired the title of the present essay, was the relationship between the development of printing technology in China and Chinese religions. Bell noted the obvious ways printing could foster the spread of religious ideas, but she also pointed out how that new medium could ossify the development of a religious tradition. Bell’s work on religion and print is a topic sure to be less familiar to those outside the inner circles of Sinology, but it is also work that has not yet attracted the attention it deserves among scholars of Chinese religions, and it invites reflection on other larger questions in the study of religion.6 4 Catherine Bell, “Printing and Religion in China: Some Evidence from the Taishang ganying pian,” Journal of Chinese Religions 20 (Fall 1992): 173–86, “‘A Precious Raft to Save theWorld’: The Interaction of Scriptural Traditions and Printing in a Chinese Morality Book,” Late Imperial China 17, no. 1 (1996): 158–200, and “Stories from the Illustrated Explanation of the Tract of the Most Exalted on Action and Response,” in Religions of China in Practice, ed. Donald S. Lopez Jr. (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1996), 437–70. In her first two published writings on the text she translates the title of the Taishang ganying pian as Treatise of the Most High on Action and Retribution. 5 Glimpses of work in that direction can be found in Catherine Bell, “Ritualization of Texts and Textualization of Ritual in the Codification of Taoist Liturgy,”History of Religions 27, no. 4 (May 1988): 366–92, “Performance,” 205–24, and “‘The Chinese Believe in Spirits’: Belief and Believ- ing in the Study of Religion,” in Radical Interpretation in Religion, ed. Nancy K. Frankenberry (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), 100–116. 6 This is not to say, however, that Bell’s work on Daoist ritual and “popular religion” has not had an impact in the field. Her work on Daoism, especially her “Ritualization of Texts and Textu- alization of Ritual in the Codification of Taoist Liturgy,” has been, and still is, regularly cited by scholars of Daoism. See, for instance, Anna Seidel, “Chronicle of Taoist Studies in the West, 1950–1990,” Cahiers d’Extre^me-Asie 5 (1990): 267; Kenneth Dean, Taoist Ritual and Popular Cults of Southeast China (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1993), 177; Stephen Boken- kamp, “Lu Xiujing, Buddhism and the First Daoist Canon,” inCulture and Power in the Reconsti- tution of the Chinese Realm, 200–600, ed.

Yet, other important ques- tions remain to be addressed. Was there, for instance, a print revolution in China that brought an end tomanuscript production? Clearly the British histo- rian of science Joseph Needham’s claim that following the invention and spread of printing “practically everything in Chinese is either printed or lost” is an untenable historical assessment.8 The surviving collections of Chinese (220–589), ed.

Manuscripts re- mained in production and use long after the advent of print. Writing about the persistence and importance of manuscript culture in the context of medieval Chinese literature, Xiaofei Tian has claimed that “hand copying a book may be a practice quite alien to us now, but it was the single most important means of transmission of knowledge and information in the age of manuscript cul- ture” and that “copying texts by hand was, moreover, practiced throughout imperial China, despite the spread of printing.”9 The rise of printing technol- ogy certainly had a major impact on textual practices by making books less expensive and more readily available, but that should not lead us to conclude that there were no practical reasons for the continuation ofmanuscript produc- tion. Certain historical and cultural factors ensured that handwritten manu- scripts remained in production and even that some books only circulated in manuscript form. J. S. Edgren, commenting on the status of manuscripts fol- lowing the acceleration of printing technology during the Northern Song Dynasty (960–1125), has noted that “collections of manuscripts were not sud- denly eclipsed by printed books. For one thing, conservative scholars were skeptical of the textual quality of the impersonal printed products; for another, good-quality books were rather expensive. No matter the rapid growth of printing, many desirable titles were not in print and could only be obtained by makingmanuscript copies.”10 Utilitarian explanations for the persistence of manuscript production in the age of print should not be taken lightly, though wewould do well to recognize that other cultural and aesthetic factors may have been involved. Frederick Mote has pointed out that “the aesthetics of calligraphy, which flourished greatly in the Tang period, not only influenced the design of printed books, but also found still more direct expression in the creation of manuscript books 9 Xiaofei Tian, Tao Yuanming and Manuscript Culture: The Record of the Dusty Table (Seat- tle: University of Washington Press, 2005), 4 and 221. See also Chia (Printing for Profit, 11–12 and 40–42), who notes that there was “an enduring interaction of manuscript and print in China,” and Cherniack (“Book Culture,” 10), who argues for the increasing importance of imprints during the Song but also remarks that “although Song printers were prolific, the majority of books in Song imperial and private libraries were still manuscripts.” 10 Edgren, “China,” 102. See also Frederick W. Mote, “Handwritten Books after the Invention of Printing,” in Mote and Chu, Calligraphy and the East Asian Book, 76–77. Joseph McDermott has questioned the speed with which manuscripts were surpassed by imprints and makes the important observation that before general conclusions are drawn about the nature of that transition more research is necessary on the relative numbers of manuscripts, since as yet “very little system- atic research has been undertaken on the history of manuscripts in the Song or any later dynasty” (“The Ascendance of the Imprint in China,” in Brokaw and Chow, Printing and Book Culture in Late Imperial China, 60). On the persistence of manuscripts following the rise of printing see also Inoue Susumu , “Shuppan bunka to gakujitsu” [The culture of publishing and scholarship], in Min Shin jidai no kihon mondai [Basic questions in the history of the Ming and Qing periods], ed.MoriMasao et al.

Some types of handwritten texts were never destined to be printed, nor were they merely produced as copies of unobtainable printed works or for readers to enjoy the aesthetic quality of the copyist’s calligraphy. When we limit our purview to that of local village life, new evidence of handwritten manuscripts comes into view. In a study of handwritten materials in villages in the New Territories of Hong Kong—based on fieldwork undertaken in the late 1970s, James Hayes begins by discussing how the ravages of historical and climatic conditions had taken their toll on the survival of manuscripts. He expresses surprise that manuscripts survived at all and concludes that “their endurance can only be attributed to the great store their owners set by them.”12 Hayes goes on to note how these types of materials “represent a new body of research material that has much to add to our conception of traditional Chi- nese society in the countryside and its social and political organization.”13 The types of handwritten texts in use in the context of local daily life can be sorted into threemain categories:14 (1) books and handbooks (including gene- alogical records, handbooks of family and social practice, almanacs, educa- tional texts, letter writing guides, guides to contracts, poetry, novels, and morality books); (2) books provided for and by specialists (including those that deal with human fate, geomancy, charms, and divination); and (3) written materials providing the cultural and social context of daily life (including signs, notices, ephemera, and placards).We are now also aware of the fact that even up through the modern period handwritten manuscripts of short stories 11 Mote, “Handwritten Books,” 76–77. 12 James Hayes, “Specialists and Written Materials in the Village World,” in Popular Culture in Late Imperial China, ed. David Johnson, Andrew J. Nathan, and Evelyn Rawski (Berkeley: Uni- versity of California Press, 1985), 76–77. 13 Hayes, “Specialists and Written Materials,” 77. Hayes’s optimism was certainly justified, as attested by the work of (among others) Rubie S. Watson, Inequality among Brothers: Class and Kinship in South China (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985); David Faure, The Struc- ture of Chinese Rural Society: Lineage and Village in the Eastern New Territories, Hong Kong (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1986); David Faure and Helen F.

It is possible to track the technological developments from handwritten texts, to woodblock printing, to printing with moveable type—and yet there is an alternative history of handwritten manuscripts that remains to be com- posed. As was the case with the history of handwritten texts after the Guten- berg revolution in theWest, the practice of producing handwritten versions of texts persisted alongside the new technology of printing and has endured until today, much like the important handwritten signature in our digital age.16 The field of Sinology is, however, only slowly approaching a state where wemight be able to one day claim, in the words of Bernard Cerquiglini, that “the manu- script, which has long been pushed to the margins of legitimate reflection and sometimes even obliterated—the abominable trace of some positivist concern —is now the latest object of analysis.”17 We await foundational studies that will help synthesize some of the different strands of research that have been completed to date. One blind spot in the study of printing and book culture in China is its rela- tionship to religious history and religious practices. As Cynthia Brokaw has noted, “surprisingly little work has been done on the impact of printing on religious reading practices and beliefs, though Catherine Bell has begun to mine this potentially rich field with a few suggestive articles on the ways in which printing, while expanding the possibilities for proselytization, might also operate to fix and thus limit the flexibility of religious doctrines.”18 This mention of Bell’s work on the critical analysis of the impact of printing on Chinese religions demonstrates her engagement with an important topic and how she was ahead of her time in asking such questions. Her work prefigured a movement within the field that recognizes the limitations of working solely with incunabula. Some scholars have begun to pay more attention to hand- writtenmanuscripts in use after the invention and spread of printing.

Those materials also force us to grapple with some intractable issues regarding category formation in the study of Chinese religions, a topic that was of fundamental importance to Bell.19 Bell seems to have been drawn to the topic of printing and religion through her work on the Taishang ganying pian (Tract of the most exalted on action and retribution). In contextualizing that text with a critical discussion of the relationship between printing and religion in Europe, Bell raised three main questions that she posited as being equally applicable to the Chinese context: (1) Did printing constitute a revolution in European culture? (2) How did reli- gion, as a major consumer and supporter of printing, change through its use of this new medium? (3) Was printing ultimately a force for sociocultural unity or division?20 What Bell discovered in pursuing these questions was that although printing technology certainly did have an impact in China, including in the domain of religion—especially in regard to the mass distribution of morality books—“printing in China never displaced hand copying the way it did in Europe. At the very least, hand copying persisted as an important first step for woodblock printing or stone engraving.”21 The Taishang ganying pian, in her interpretation, was therefore not an example of the success of a “printing revolution” but was distinctive due to its innovative claim about the religious efficacy and merit-making potential of its own dissemination.22 Although Bell relegated the handwritten manuscript to the status of being a mere preparatory aide in the printing process, it is now clear that—just as in the case of secularmanuscript culture—religiousmanuscripts retained a special sta- tus and continued to be produced even when not destined to be printed. Hand- written religious manuscripts have, however, received less attention than they deserve due to a primary focus among scholars on the history of the relationship between Buddhism and the invention and development of printing technology in China from about the seventh century onward.23 The printing of individual 19 See, e.g., Bell, “The Chinese Believe in Spirits,” and “Paradigms Behind (and Before).” 20 Bell, “Printing and Religion in China,” 173. 21 Ibid., 176. 22 Of course, as Bell herself concedes (“Precious Raft,” 170, 175), “a Buddhist ‘cult of the book’ long predated the earliest copy of the Treatise,” but she argues that the Treatise “pushed the significance of distribution much further.” On the Buddhist cult of the book, see, among others, Gregory Schopen, “The Phrase ‘sa pṛthiv ıprades as  caityabhu to bhavet’ in the Vajracchedika : Notes on the Cult of the Book inMah ay ana,” Indo-Iranian Journal 17 (1975): 147–81. 23 See, however, the comments on the importance of handwritten manuscripts by Barrett, The Woman Who Discovered Printing, especially chap. 3; and the important earlier articles by Kristo- fer M. Schipper, “The Written Memorial in Taoist Ceremonies,” in Religions and Ritual in Chi- nese Society, ed. Arthur P. Wolf (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1974), 309–24, which discuss the importance of “manuscript” versions of Daoist ritual documents, and “Vernacular and </page> <page sequence="8"> 324 Brushes with Some “Dirty Truths” religious texts and complete canons accelerated rapidly from the tenth century to the present, but that trend did not result in the eradication of manuscript cul- ture either.24 Indeed, one could mount a persuasive argument that the most sig- nificant developments in the contemporary study of Chinese religions have been ignited by the discovery and study of survivingmanuscript collections. The most influential discovery of the past century was, of course, that of the rich cache of manuscripts found at Dunhuang , an important Silk Road outpost in far western China.25 Although the discovery of a printed edi- tion of theDiamond Su tra in those caves has attracted an inordinate amount of attention, since it is dated to 868 and therefore considered to be the oldest dated printed book in theworld (though other printedmaterials already existed and are also attested in Korea and Japan), the printed materials found in that cache are in fact far outnumbered by handwritten manuscripts.26 The Dun- huang discoveries, and other discoveries of manuscripts at Turfan and other locales in western China, invigorated the study of Chinese manuscripts, espe- cially in the fields of Buddhist and Daoist studies, apocryphal texts, philology, astronomy, divination, calendrics, social history, politics, and legal history.27 Classical Ritual in Taoism,” Journal of Asian Studies 45, no. 1 (1985): 21–57.

At that time scholars discovered that this handwritten canonwas not merely a copy of a printed edition of the canon but contained versions of texts that predated the Song dynasty edition of the canon, many apocryphal works (including the ear- liest extant apocryphon, titled Piluo sanmei jing ), and editions of texts that were thought to be long lost (including the Sanjie fofa , a key text in the Three Stages movement). The initial attention given to the dra- matic discoveries at Nanantsu-dera (and subsequent discoveries at Kong oji and other temples) has not, however, led to an outpouring of new research outside of Japan.29 The discovery of apocryphal manuscripts and manuscripts of texts thought to be lost constitutes a significant development in the study of Chinese reli- gions, but the majority of the texts discovered thus far are the product of elite circles. It has been much more difficult to gain access to premodern manu- scripts related to popular forms of religious beliefs and practices.30 One of the reasons for that difficulty is that nonelite forms of manuscripts rarely circu- lated widely or freely. Over the past three decades, however, scholars doing fieldwork in various regions of China have brought to our attention the sur- prising survival of a wide range of religious manuscripts, including (among other things) handwritten (chaoben ) ritual manuals (keyi ben ) (W€urzburg: Ko ̈nigshausen &amp; Neumann, 1985); Anna Seidel, La divinisation de Lao Tseu dans le tao€ısme des Han (Paris: E ́cole franc ̧aise d’Extr^eme-Orient, 1969); Wu Chi-yu, Pen-tsi king (Livre du terme original: Ouvrage tao€ıste ine ́dit du VIIe sie cle; manuscrits retrouve ́s a` Touen-houang reproduits en fac-simile ́ (Paris: Centre national de la recherche scientifique, 1960); and Yoshioka Yoshitoyo , Do kyo  to bukkyo  [Daoism and Buddhism], 3 vols.

Some new handwritten manuscript collections have been discovered in the most unlikely of places. Among the many possible topics that could be discussed here, what I would like to introduce are the manu- scripts that have been preservedwithin the dark inner recesses of religious stat- ues. Thework ofmuseum conservators and research on early Buddhist textual references has revealed a long history of the placing manuscripts inside Bud- dhist statues that remains to be fully explored.32 Placing manuscripts inside statues is first attested in connection with Indian Buddhism and was transmit- ted to China, Korea, and Japan.33 There is a significant body of textual evidence—including doctrinal works and the written accounts by pilgrims and travelers—concerning the placement of texts and relics inside stu pas and statues at the time of consecration. During his travels in India in the seventh century, for instance, Xuanzang (602– 64) observed that “there is a practice in India of making incense powder into 31 This literature is now quite extensive; see, among others, Wang Ch’iu-kuei , ed.,Min- su ch’u€-i ts’ung-shu , 80 vols.

Although much of the work thus far concerns Japanese images, some of the studies cited here also discuss Chinese examples.

They call these dharmas ar ıra.”34 Amuch later Indian text—theVajra val ı byAbhay akaragupta (1064?–1125?)—also explicates that “you should at the time of making an image leave the head or back hollow. When completed you should write a dharani on birch bark with saffron or bezoar and wrap them around the relic which has been purified through the bathing ritual and then place them in the hollow space.”35 Evidence for the interring of manuscripts inside statues in East Asia is dif- ficult to compile due to the paucity of surviving wooden statuary in China and the lack of systematic studies on Chinese wooden statuary.36 There are some extant examples, such as the Arhat statues at the Lingyan si in Shandong, and Chinese statues preserved in Japan also provide some important clues.37 One of the best-known examples of this kind of statuary is, of course, the Seiry oji Shaka , which was found to have a large niche in the back that was filled with numerous texts—and other objects such as symbolic viscera and textiles—by Japanese conservators studying it in 1954. An inscription on the backside of the wooden cover of the cache informs us that the image was made between August 9 and September 5, 985, for Ch onen (938–1016), a Japanese pilgrim who went to China and returned to Japan in 986, by two brothers, Zhang Yanjiao and Zhang Yanxi from Taizhou (modern Zhejiang province). The statue contains a handwritten “oath text” by the monk Ch onen and his friend Giz o that was completed in 972 and hand- written copies of the Suvarṇaprabha sa Su tra and Lotus Su tra. The cache also included a woodblock print of the Vajracchedika  Prajn~a paramita  Su tra that is dated to 985, the year the statue was closed. In their study of this image Henderson and Hurvitz surmise that many other images might have similar caches of contents, but unfortunately no further evidence is reported.38 Subse- quent research on Chinese wooden statuary over the past fifty or so years has provided some tantalizing glimpses of evidence that suggests the practice of 34 T.51.920a21–23.

Since I also discussed these materials with Catherine Bell in my final correspondence with her, it seemed perfectly appropriate to include them in the present essay in this vol- ume commemorating her work. In 1984, following the interception and con- fiscation of a shipping container filled with nearly one thousand small wooden religious statuettes bound for the antiquities markets in Hong Kong, Chinese customs officials in Hunan province placed them in the Hunan Provincial Museum in Changsha. Since 1984 many more of these statues have been found to be preserved in four other private collections (two in China, one in the United States, and one in Taiwan), with each collection holding about a thousand statues, though one collection includes about 3,000 statues—bring- ing the total number to about 8,000—and many can still be found circulating among antiquities dealers in China, Europe, and the United States.40 Since nearly all of the statues in those collections originated in Hunan, it seems to indicate that these statues are distinctive to that region of China. The majority of the statues date from the Qing dynasty to the present day, and—as will be discussed further below—they can be of national pantheon gods, local gods, ritual masters, or ancestors. Beginning with an ambitious project headed by Alain Arrault of the E ́cole franc ̧aise d’Extre^me-Orient to catalogue the three collections in China, the project has now been extended to include cataloging and studying all the extant collections.41 There is still much to be learned about various aspects of local culture and religious practice in the Hunan region from the detailed study of these statues, but what is most pertinent to the present essay is what is 39 See, for instance, John Larson and Rose Kerr, “A Hero Restored: The Conservation of Guan Di,”Orientations 22, no. 7 (1991): 28–34. 40 The most comprehensive description and study of the two main collections in China is Alain Arrault, “Analytic Essay on the Domestic Statuary of Central Hunan: The Cult to Divinities, Par- ents, andMasters,” Journal of Chinese Religions 36 (2008): 1–53.

The primary object in a statue’s cache is the “consecration certificate” (yizhi ), a handwritten manuscript providing an unprecedented amount of information that is placed inside the statue during an elaborate “eye opening” consecration ritual (kaiguang ). I therefore treat these documents as con- stituting an alternative form of a manuscript archive.44 The consecration certi- ficates tend to have a standardized form though the certificate can vary dramat- ically in length (from a few lines to a few pages) and in content.45 In general, a consecration certificate begins—sometimes following an opening invocation—with the precise address of the home or shrine where the statue was installed, indicating the district, town, village, and name of temple. Following the address on the yizhi are the names of all of the donors who 42 For more general studies see Alain Arrault and Michela Bussotti, “Statuettes religieuses et certificats de conse ́cration en Chine du Sud (XVIIe–XXe si ecle),” Arts Asiatiques 63 (2008): 36– 60; Arrault, “Domestic Statuary of Central Hunan”; Fu Juliang , “Hunan minjian mudiao shenxiang ” [Wood carved folk deity statues fromHunan], in Zhongguo wenwu shijie 150 (1998): 54–68; and Keith Stevens, “Altar images from Hunan and Kiangsi,” Journal of the Hong Kong Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society 18 (1978): 41–48 and plates on 217–22.

The texts are written out in black ink, though some contain some red/orange embellishments in the sections that included talismans or images of deities.We are currently analyzing the paper to determine what types of paper were used, though it is clear that a variety of paper of varying qual- ity is found in the documents and that in many cases red or yellow dyed paper was used. </page> <page sequence="15"> History of Religions 331 FIG. 1.—Front and back of Hunan statue (showing cavity). Photograph by author. commissioned the statue. If the names in this section of the consecration cer- tificate are not of disciples of a particular religious master, then they are usu- ally those of members of the same family and tend to include the names of the main patron (usually the father) and his wife, as well as of their sons (and their wives) and daughters. While many of the consecration certificates merely contain lists of names, some of them also contain short biographies. This may seem like a trivial point, but it is actually quite significant for those interested in genealogy, since in other historical documents women are hidden away— either through neglect or because they remain nameless. From one perspec- tive, then, these images and their contents are what Michael Baxandall has termed “deposits of social relationships.”46 The consecration certificate usu- ally ends with the date of the consecration, the statue carver’s name, and in some cases a register of talismans (see fig. 2). The consecration certificate in figure 2 has a clear structure that is gener- ally representative of the types ofmanuscripts that are found in the Hunan stat- ues. It begins with an invocation stating that this statue is extremely auspi- cious and that its numinous qualities can bring protection and peace. Next, the precise address where this statue was located is provided: a local village shrine in the Shaoyang district of Baoqing prefecture in Hunan 46 Michael Baxandall, Painting and Experience in Fifteenth-Century Italy: A Primer in the Social History of Pictorial Style (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1972), 1. </page> <page sequence="16"> FIG. 2.—The consecration certificate (M0094).

It also provides the names of all of the patrons who commis- sioned the carving of this statue, including Zhou Weichang , his wife, ne ́e Hu , their eldest son Hehan and his wife, ne ́e Fan , and their daughters Hejin and Helin . It also includes the names of the family members living in their house, including Zhou Weizhi and his wife (xieshi ), ne ́e Zeng , their sons Hexing , Hecai , and Heshu , and their daughters Xingjin andDongjin . The statue is identi- fied as being that of their ancestor named Zhou Falong , who was born in 1847 and died in 1901. The “intention,” or reason for consecration, is pre- sented in a general formulaic pattern: “So that there will be protection and auspiciousness for all family members, so that the six domestic animals will be peaceful, and that all the family’s affairs will be propitious. May the males enjoy good fortune and the females receive good luck.”47 Then follows the date that the statue was consecrated with an “eye opening” ceremony (1914), the name of the sculptor (Zhou Falei ), and a string of talismans inter- spersed with legible text. A second manuscript (fig. 3) further demonstrates the value of these hand- written texts for providing the researcher with a rare glimpse of the domestic level of local Chinese religious practice.48 This manuscript from the Anhua region in present-day north central Hunan reveals how the wife of a cer- tain Liu Xingjie , ne ́e Li , was suffering from an eye illness. They attempted to cure her with medicine, but it offered no help. Therefore, the hus- band appealed to Nanyue shengdi —the principal deity of the South- ern Sacred Peak (Nanyue) that enjoys a large cultic following in the Hunan region—with the hope that, by drinking the deity’s divine tea, the wife’s eye illness would be cured, her vision would return, and the eye problems would never arise again. He commissioned the carving of a statue of Nanyue shengdi, and on that very day and auspicious rain fell. The consecration certif- icate includes the names of their two sons and ends with some general prayers for peace, prosperity, and thriving domestic animals. This manuscript is a good example of how these documents can mix together specific information about a person or family with stock phrases aimed at general welfare. Now that we have access to a large number of certificates we can begin to use these documents to pursue detailed socialhistorical questions. Based on the data contained on the consecration certificates in the various collections catalogued thus far, it is possible to perform a search, for example, on the par- ticular name of a donor (or of a specific address) in order to gain a sense of 47 See Arrault and Bussotti, “Statuettes religieuses.” For a general discussion of statements of “intention” in Daoist rituals, see Schipper, “Written Memorial in Taoist Ceremonies,” 319–20. The “six domestic animals” [“liuchu.” ] include horse, ox, goat, pig, dog, and fowl. 48 This manuscript has also been discussed in Arrault, “Domestic Statuary of Central Hunan,” 21. </page> <page sequence="18"> 334 Brushes with Some “Dirty Truths” FIG. 3.—Consecration certificate (T0428).

The more detailed manuscripts have the potential of taking us down into the domestic level of what Catherine Bell described as “routine and ubiquitous ritual,” a domain of Chinese religions that has been difficult for historians to gain a handle on due to a paucity of sources. Therefore, the Hunan statues invite us to engage with another topic that parallels material that Bell was interested in, namely, the daily incense offering at the domestic altar.49 She described the typical domestic altar as being “divided roughly in half. Its right side (stage right, the subordinate position) accommodates several generations of ancestor tablets in the form of names and dates on a large paper scroll, a wooden board, or smaller individual tablets for each person or couple. Tradi- tionally a red dot next to the name denotes the installation of the soul of the deceased in the tablet. On the left side (stage left, the superior position), there are paper images and often a statue or two of the more popular deities in the 49 Bell, “Performance,” 212–13. </page> <page sequence="19"> History of Religions 335 region.”50 Bell’s description of the altar agrees with most traditional accounts, which also note the presence of ancestral tablets and deity statues. Yet, Bell signaled her own sense of nervousness about this type of general description. She was cognizant of the potential challenges to textual prescriptions and pro- scriptions that a “performance approach”might bring to the study of this “hum- ble act in terms of a specific ethnographic instance instead of a generalized description in the abstract.” She said that any such general description and “[any attempt] to formulate a system run into counter examples and regional differences very quickly.”51 Although Bell seems to have never carried out fieldwork herself, she hit the nail on the head with this observation. It is the richness of the material available for studying the specific case of the Hunan statuettes—and the ways that they challenge certain well-entrenched para- digms in the study of Chinese religious practice, and the place of ancestor images within the domestic ancestral cult in particular—that surely would have captivated Bell, given her long-standing interest in the tensions between canon- ical (printed) textual prescriptions and popular or local forms of practice.52 One striking feature of the Hunan statues is the fact that many of them, as the names on the consecration certificates attest (including M0094 in fig. 2), are for familial ancestors stretching from the distant past up to the recently deceased.53 Statues dedicated to fathers are the most common, but images identified as being of grandparents, brothers, mothers, uncles, and aunts are also well attested. This is a rather surprising phenomenon, since in traditional forms of Chinese ancestor veneration anthropomorphic images of the ances- tors were forbidden. During the twelfth century, for example, Zhu Xi (1130–1200) was outspoken in his disapproval of the use of portraits or sta- tues in ancestor worship, and he carefully refrained from using the term “image halls” (yingtang ).54 The proper form of veneration was merely 50 Ibid. 51 Ibid., 215, 218. 52 In 2003 Bell had already demonstrated an interest in ancestral portraits and the way that those paintings depicted accurate representations of individual ancestors rather than “generalizable types.” SeeCatherine Bell, “Review ofWorshipping the Ancestors: Chinese Commemorative Por- traits,”China Quarterly 173 (March 2003): 248–50. 53 See Stevens, “Altar Images from Hunan and Kiangsi,” and Keith Stevens, ”Portraits and Ancestral Images on Chinese Altars,” Arts of Asia 19, no. 1 (1989): 135–45; as well as the more recent work of Arrault, “Domestic Statuary of Central Hunan,” 39–43, and Alain Arrault, “Por- traits sculpte ́s d’ance^tres et de maıˆtres dans le Hunan,” Cahiers d’Extre^me-Asie (forthcoming).

The proscription against images was visibly loosened during the Qing dynasty, since this period saw the appearance of painted portraits of direct ancestors, the origin of the current custom of placing a photo of the deceased on the altar.”56 Therefore, while it is rare to find statues representing members of the family in other regions of China—though Keith Stevens has provided evidence for the existence of some images of ancestors on altars in Taiwan and among the Chinese diaspora communities in Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Singapore, Manila, and Medan—they are one of the main categories of statues in the central Hunan region. Without the detailed information pro- vided on the consecration certificates, which identifies the statue by name and designates the relationship to the donors, it would have been far more difficult to provide solid evidence that these images on domestic altars were indeed of ancestors. Why did the documents inside the Hunan statues remain in manuscript form? The short—and clearly inadequate—response to that question would be that it is related to the limitations of the static nature of the print medium and the necessity of having a certain modicum of flexibility to include all the 55 Patricia Ebrey, “Portrait Sculptures in Imperial Ancestral Rites in Song China,” T ’oung Pao 83, nos. 1–3 (1997): 47. 56 Arrault, “Domestic Statuary of Central Hunan,” 39.

Yet, if we move from the particu- lar back to the general, we can rephrase the question in the following way: how do we explain the persistence of manuscript culture in the age of print? This is, of course, a complicated question that defies easy explanations or gen- eralizations. Some types of texts, as we saw above, may have remained pri- marily in manuscript form due to the economic fact that they were cheaper to produce and easier to reproduce and disseminate. I would like to suggest here, however, that there were positive and negative reasons for keeping religious texts like the Hunan statues’ certificates in manu- script form rather than utilize the new printing technology. The positive reasons include Chinese conceptions about the spiritually charged nature of handwrit- ing and the religious practice of hand copying texts. Frederick Mote, for in- stance, suggested that manuscripts remained in widespread use after the devel- opment of printing due to “aesthetic and devotional” reasons. By focusing on these two characteristics Mote signaled the importance of calligraphy as well as the merit-making potential of producing handwritten copies of Buddhist and Daoist texts and popularmorality books.57 There is also a long and intricate his- tory of the religious significance and cosmic associations of writing in China that can only be mentioned in brief here.58 Suffice it to say, in the words of Anna Seidel, that “in the Western mind, script is included in the divine curse that divided mankind and separated it from its origins according to the Tower of Babel myth of the confusion of languages. In Chinese mythology, on the other hand, the written sign precedes the spoken word and has always kept its entirely positive cosmogonic power of unfolding and arranging reality.”59 Indeed, it was precisely this type of power and potential of language itself that drew Bell’s scholarly attention to the Taishang ganying pian. In a later reflection on her earlier work on that text she stated that she had “tried to explore the shape of a paradigm in a project on the nature of textuality in China. I saw textuality as invoking distinct cosmological structures, although the focus on Chinese texts was due to my own love of their aesthetic material- 57 Mote, “Handwritten Books,” 77. 58 I have cited much of the scholarship on this topic in James Robson, “Signs of Power: Talis- manic Writing in Chinese Buddhism,” History of Religions 48, no. 2 (2008): 130–69.

In Chinese history, an earlier divinatory cosmos and spoken words of the masters became bound in commentary until new sources of texts were found in new layers of the cosmos.”60 Bell is here refer- ring to the successive revelations of new texts by Daoist deities (from ever- more ethereal domains of the cosmos) to humans who wrote down their pure rarified language in human script. Indeed many scholars, Kristoffer Schipper foremost among them, have proposed that “Chinese writing was invented in the first place in order to communicate with spiritual beings.”61 While human writing is merely an imperfect representation of the pure language of the dei- ties, traces of that rarified language are found in the strange and largely illegi- ble form of script that is included in Daoist texts and used to write talismans that are deployed in ritual and healing regimes. As I have described before in the pages of this journal, written talismans, by virtue of their unique position somewhere between the “legible” and “illegible,” between the “spirit world” and the “human world,” served as med- iums for communication with (or control of) the realm of demons and deities. Talis- manic script could express or illustrate ineffable meanings and powers that defy transmission by traditional modalities of communication: oral or written. Talismans were sacred images that mirrored the forms of the primordial energies at the inception of the world and were therefore imbued with a spiritual power drawn from an ability to share in the essence of the thing it names or represents.62 Most talismans are handwritten and comprised of imbricated graphs although, as Strickmann has argued, they were connected to printing since they were carved into wooden blocks and printed as seals (yin ) on paper or the body.63 Despite Strickmann’s seminal work, Bell is still correct in her assessment that “the mass-production and distribution of printed scriptural talismans for per- 60 Bell, “Paradigms Behind (and Before),” 46. 61 Schipper, “WrittenMemorial in Taoist Ceremonies,” 324. 62 Robson, “Signs of Power,” 138.

While some sectarian groups used printing technology to disseminate their teachings, when they produced talismans and incantations used for healing those re- mained in handwritten form.65 Therefore, as Susan Naquin has observed, there are as many printed sectarian scriptures as there are handwritten ones.66 Even texts that were not technical manuals for writing talismanswere treated like tal- ismans themselves. Drawing on Naquin’s earlier research on sectarian groups and their relationships to texts, Bell noted that “the possession of texts, like Daoist talismans witnessing to a special relationship to Heaven, established the authoritative leadership of the group; production of copies might well have compromised that type of claim. There is evidence that in those groups consid- ered most threatening to the Qing government, important religious scriptures were not widely disseminated among followers.”67 Thus, in order to protect their method of conferring authority on sect leaders, texts were not mass pro- duced and did not circulate widely, since they had to remain tokens of power and legitimacy, much like the ritual hand copying of a master’s ritual manuals as part of the initiation of a disciple within the Daoist tradition. In addition to the positive reasons for keeping some religious texts in man- uscript form, in the preceding citation Bell hinted at one possible negative rea- son for not printing them. The basic idea is that printing, especially for sectar- ian groups that were problematic for the Ming and Qing governments, came with certain risks. “Printing,” as Bell notes, “could also alert authorities, effec- tively incriminate sect leaders, and train officials in better policing of such activities, which happened with triad groups. For example, government prohi- bition of sectarian activity and the routine confiscation of their texts meant that hand-copying had advantages over the dangers of printing, which could quickly lead authorities to a convert group.”68 All of this suggests that there were a vari- ety of good reasons why the hand copying of texts persisted in the age of print. Earlier in this essay I referenced James Hayes’s remarks about how newly discovered handwritten materials found at the village level had the potential to add much to our understanding of traditional Chinese society and its social and political organization. It is now also clear that a focus on handwritten reli- 64 Bell, “Printing and Religion in China,” 186. 65 Susan Naquin,Millenarian Rebellion in China: The Eight Trigrams Uprising of 1813 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1977), 20. 66 Ibid., 292–93. 67 Bell, “Precious Raft,” 183. 68 Ibid., 184–85. </page> <page sequence="24"> 340 Brushes with Some “Dirty Truths” gious documents has the same potential of adding much to our understanding of Chinese religions. Solidifying an argument for the ongoing importance of religious manuscripts at a time when so much attention is focused on print technology is perhaps an important step in its own right. But if the discussion did not reflect on larger issues in the study of Chinese religions then it would not be in the spirit of Catherine Bell’s work, which always sought to make larger methodological points based on specific cases. One of the payoffs of directing attention back to handwritten manuscripts has been (and continues to be) the potential they have for allowing access to— and opening up new vantage points onto—the most persistent and common forms of Chinese religious practices. Yet, due to entrenched categorization schemes, which the contemporary Chinese government has reified in the form of its delineation of what constitutes orthodox “religion,” the unnamed reli- gions of the masses have been occluded and fallen into the fissures that have formed as a result of the configuration of those categories. One of the impor- tant tasks the Chinese state set for itself was the enactment of a clear separa- tion between religion and superstition.69 Although the etymologies of the terms zongjiao and mixin are contested by modern scholars, it seems that when they first entered the Chinese lexicon as referents of the terms “religion” and “superstition,” respectively, during the beginning of the twentieth century they came to be formulated along the lines of Western usages in hierarchic binary relation and have also been at the heart of the Chi- nese state’s posture toward religion and the formation of the categories used for thinking about religion.70 There is a long history of these developments, how they set the conceptual categories employed in structuring academic approaches to the study of Chinese religions, and how those decisions have had a very real impact at the level of local society. We can gain a sense of these developments and their effects, for instance, by reference to the 1997 “White Paper on Freedom of Religious Belief in China.” In that report, five religions—Buddhism, Daoism, Catholicism, Prot- estantism, and Islam—were recognized as legitimate and therefore guaran- teed religious freedom. The first paragraph of the white paper states that among these religions people “may freely choose and express their religious beliefs and make clear their religious affiliations.”71 The white paper serves as a particularly good example for demonstrating how for the Chinese govern- 69 Rebecca Nedostup, Superstitious Regimes: Religion and the Politics of Chinese Modernity (Cambridge,MA: HarvardUniversity Asia Center, 2009). 70 This is a topic that Catherine Bell took up for analysis in her “The Chinese Believe in Spir- its.” See also Vincent Goossaert, “The Concept of Religion in China and the West,” Diogenes 52 (2005): 13–20, 14–15; and Nedostup, Superstitious Regimes, 6–11. 71 “Freedom of Religious Belief in China,” inWhite Papers of the Chinese Government, 1996– 1999 (Beijing: Foreign Languages Press, 2000), 227. </page> <page sequence="25"> History of Religions 341 ment legitimate religion is that which is organized into a “church” with an identifiable “canon,” place of worship, priestly organization, and congrega- tion. People’s religious expression is expected to fall in line with one of these five. Vincent Goossaert has summed up well the basic issues that are raised with this new vision of religion. The most significant consequence of this process of purification that aimed to sepa- rate the five approved religions from “superstitions” (that is, the basis of Chinese reli- gion) was that the great majority of communities worshipping local saints in village or neighbourhood temples were deprived of all legal protection, and their temples were confiscated and converted into schools, police stations, garrisons, etc. The reli- gious life of these temples, which was rediscovered by observers from the 1960s on (in Taiwan, Hong Kong and the diaspora, then in China itself from the 1980s), is today the focus of researchers’ attention. A kind of rehabilitation of local cults is tak- ing place under the title “popular religion,” “folk religion” or minjian xinyang (liter- ally “popular beliefs”). However, though these labels help us to realize that the Chi- nese religious environment is not limited to the five approved religions together with the sectarian groups, they nevertheless confirm a process that has been underway for a century with the aim of separating religions from superstitions; by inventing a new, hybrid category of popular religion to replace the mass of ‘superstitions’, we forget the fundamental unity of Chinese religion’s practices and representations, within which local cults and Taoist, Buddhist and Confucian institutions all have a stake.72 As the ongoing work ofWang Qiugui, John Lagerwey, Kenneth Dean, David Johnson, Daniel Overmyer, and others doing fieldwork and documentation of local historical and religious manuscripts attests, it is precisely the different forms of what Dean calls “local communal religion” that characterize the most common types of religious practice.73 Although there is at present some effort to find a place for local communal forms of religion, since those forms of religious practice had historically fallen outside the official definitions of religion articulated by the Chinese government they were ignored or treated with opprobrium.74 Most of this new research, which has in large part been made possible through the discovery and study of newly available manu- scripts, demonstrates the new possibilities for studying Chinese religion 72 Vincent Goossaert, “Concept of Religion,” 16. 73 Kenneth Dean, Taoist Ritual and Popular Cults of Southeast China (Princteon, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1993), 7.

The study of local Chinese religion as it is embedded in society has finally brought the field to the point—once envisioned by Catherine Bell—where we can “confess our failure to find ade- quate generalizations” about Chinese religions and the need to attend to (what ArthurWolf called) the “stubborn facts.”75 It is within this interpretive framework, built as it is around work on hand- written documents and their relationship to religion, that I have also tried to situate my discussion of the body of manuscripts found within statues. The Hunan statues, and their manuscripts in particular, provide similar access to the normally impenetrable realm of nonelite religion as it is practiced in local villages and inside the home on the domestic altar. The consecration certifi- cates lead us into the realms of local history, religion, and culture that are not well attested in Chinese printed sources. At the same time, however, these manuscripts force us out into other manuscript archives (such as handwritten ritual manuals, family genealogies, and documents in regional archives that were never destined for print), which are all necessary in order to provide a more robust liturgical, social, and historical context for interpreting their con- tent.76 The suggestion that we need to take manuscripts more seriously in the study of Chinese religions should not be understood as an immoderate claim to forswear all printed historical or religious texts. Clearly in the study of such a diverse and problematic topic such as Chinese religions we need to have our hands on as many different types of sources as possible. Despite the development and spread of printing technology in China— coupled with the trenchant critiques and proscriptions of religion at different junctures in Chinese history—significant manuscript collections survive in unlikely places in contemporary China. The extra effort expended to unearth them promises to be worthwhile, since their contents have already begun to add significant new information not captured in highly edited printed texts.77 75 Bell, “Performance,” 218, drawing on a phrase coined by Arthur Wolf in his “Gods, Ghosts, and Ancestors,” inReligion and Ritual in Chinese Society, ed. Arthur P.Wolf (Stanford, CA: Stan- ford University Press, 1974), 131–82. 76 See Chen Zi’ai and Hua Lan (Alain Arrault), eds., Xiangzhong zongjiao yu xiangtu shehui diaocha baogao ji , 2 vols.

(Beijing: Zongjiao wenhua chuban she, forthcoming). 77 This statement is not merely applicable to the study of Daoism or popular religion but applies equally to the mining of Dunhuang manuscripts and other manuscript collections. On what is pos- sible with Buddhist manuscripts, see, for example, Gao Guofan, Zhongguo minsu tanwei, and Dunhuang minsu ziliao daolun; and Hao Chunwen , Tanghouqi Wudai Songchu Dunhuang sengni de shehui shenghuo [The social lives of monks and nuns in Dunhuang during the Late Tang, Five Dynasties, and Early Song] (Beijing: Zhongguo she- hui kexueyuan chubanshe, 1998). </page> <page sequence="27"> History of Religions 343 The relationship between handwritten manuscripts and print might be com- pared to Henry Petroski’s remarks about the differences between writing in pencil (manuscript) and ink (print) in theWest: The pencil, the tool of doodlers, stands for thinking and creativity. . . . The pencil’s graphite . . . is the ephemeral medium of thinkers, planners, drafters, architects, and engineers, the medium to be erased, revised, smudged, obliterated, lost—inked over. Ink, on the other hand, whether in a book or on plans or on a contract, signifies finality and supersedes the pencil drafts and sketches. If early pencilings interest collectors, it is often because of their association with the permanent success written or drawn in ink. Unlike graphite, to which paper is like sandpaper, ink flows smoothly and fills in the nooks and crannies of creation. Ink is the cosmetic that ideas will wear when they go out in public. Graphite is their dirty truth.78 In the study of Chinese religions we still have many “dirty truths” and “stub- born facts” that might yet be revealed through the study of extant manu- scripts. AlthoughCatherine Bell’s research onChinese religions never reached full fruition—making it all the more lamentable that the final chapter of her schol- arship will remain unwritten—I hope that this essay has pointed to one of the directions—outside her prolific output on ritual and ritual studies—where her work had a potential impact on the field of Sinology. Since Bell was deeply interested in the study of texts not “simply as expressions or reflections of changing social situations but as dynamic agents of change,” it is hoped that a focus on her insights about the nature of Chinese religious texts will invite fur- ther discussion about manuscripts in the age of print, even if it is only possible for her to participate in those conversations through the essays and books she left with us.79 Harvard University 78 Henry Petroski, The Pencil: A History of Design and Circumstance (New York: Knopf, 1992), 6. 79 Bell, “Ritualization of Texts,” 369. </page> </plain_text>
