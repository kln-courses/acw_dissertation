<plain_text><page sequence="1">CORRESPONDENCE* THE BUDDHIST AND HINDU ARCHI- TECTURE OF INDIA. If space can be afforded me for a rejoinder to Pro- fessor Macdonell' s letter that appeared in the Journal of March 1 2th, I should like to say that I had hoped the name Vishnu in place of Siva would have been viewed as an obvious oversight due to the frequency of the former in the two or three sentences that pre- ceded. What I had in my mind, however, was to emphasise the fact that a few symbols (as Professor Macdonell has himself shown), which we associate with modern Hinduism, can be traced back, on certain early Buddhist monuments, to at least 150 b.c., and, as he has told us, they are even mentioned in the Rigveda, say a thousand years still earlier. Under these circumstances it seems to me the Professor has forced an undesirably severe separation of symbols used as aids in devotional exercices from anthropo- morphic idols. And this, perhaps, has led him to affirm (p. 321) that " the oldest remains of independent Hindu art, either sculptural or architectural, only date from several centuries after the beginning of our era.. These considerations in themselves justify the pre- sumption that Hindu architecture is derived from the older art of the Buddhists." Unless, however, it can be shown that the anthropomorphic idol oí Lakshmi and the trisula , the serpent and other symbols were originally Buddhist, their existence on the Sanchi rail seems to countenance the presump- tion, viz., that they came into early Buddhism from a pre-Buddhistic faith- a faith which very possibly re- quired idols and symbols. And if such were an in- heritance, tolerated by early Buddhism, it can hardly be upheld as an unwarrantable conjecture that the people from whom they were derived very possibly themselves erected houses or temples in which to place their idols or religious symbols. In other words we have to accept pre-Buddhist wooden sculpture and architecture as very nearly a certainty. As opposed to this view, I understand that in an- other lecture (on this subject) Professor Macdonell said : - u There is no evidence that any of the early Indian religions made images of their gods." In consequence of that view he came to the conclusion that it was " not unlikely that Europe gave the first impulse to the immense worship of idols which now prevails in Buddhist countries as well as in India." But surely before accepting so very definite a pro- nouncement it becomes essential for us to consider whether the idols and symbols of the Buddhist topes were invented by the Buddhists or had only crept into Buddhism from a pre-Buddhist faith. It seems- to me beside the issue to contend that because no in- dependent Hindu monument of an early date has survived that shows idols therefore idols were not used prior to the phase of Buddhism when that faith itself became idolatrous. Is it not highly probable that the Buddhists up to a certain point simply carried forward and perfected the arts and architec- ture of the pre-Buddhist peoples, on lines perhaps parallel to those followed contemporaneously by the: Jains and the Hindus ? But we are promised a com- plete expression of Professor MacdonelPs views and. interpretations of this and other most interesting problems of Indian architecture, and it is, therefore,, unfair to criticise isolated sentences or even an abstract lecture, such as is alone possible in the time allowed by the Royal Society of Arts. In venturing, therefore, to differ from Professor Macdonell at all, I do so purely and simply on the basis of art and architecture, not Sanskrit literature, nor even Hindu mythology. I spent many years of my Indian life studying the arts and industries of - that country, and, I confess, have come (rightly or wrongly) to think that while India doubtless derived much from her neighbours and even her conquerors (as most countries s'milarly placed have done), still in all ages there have existed, as there exists to-day,.</page><page sequence="2">38o JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS.

Like Fergusson, 1 have always viewed the lineal descent of the pagoda as so self-evident that it was, perhaps, hardly necessary to indicate the suc- cessive steps by which the ultimate manifestation had been attained. The evolution or growth of the chaitya was practically completed when it is first brought to our attention in the cave temples. It is, in other words, impossible to believe that the idea of, and the necessity for, the chaitya could have been at once attained on the desite having arisen to excavate temples out of the solid rock. It seems far more natural to think that the perfection reached in wood had itself suggested the desir- ability of a more durable material being employed. Familiarity with the new material was accordingly all that was needed to allow the old building skill and the matuied art conceptions to be faithfully rendered. Little surprise need, therefore, be felt that none of the experimental stages have survived. The wooden character of the early chaityas shows the persistence of ideas that had almost attained the position of sacred associations before they had been rendered in stone, and such could not, therefore, at once be rejected even when they had become obviously superfluous as structural features. The knowledge and skill - the engineering precision one might call it - which all this involves carries the chaitya far into pre-Buddhist times and renders it one of the central features of Indian architecture. In many directions the chaitya can be shown to have influenced the subsequent growth of Hindu and Mohammedan art and architecture. It was on this account that I ventured to repeat Fergusson's suggestion that the chaitya might be looked for in certain of the temples found erected by the primitive hill tribes of the tract of country adjacent to the region wheie Buddhism originated. The explanation offered by Colonel Hendley (and which Professor Macdonell now tells us he shares) when he enquired of me ' ' Whether many of the pagodas in the hills were not forced upon the hill people by the Nepalese, and, whether they were not, to a certain extent, Buddhist, having been derived from the architecture of the plains," raises two questions to which I would give the following íeply : - ist. The Gurkhas d.ite their sovereignty from the middle of the eighteenth century, and hence their •conquests in the North-West Himala)as are too recent to have had any influence on the architecture west of Nepal, and south of the upper basins of the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab. Moreover, they were Hindus who conquered the Newars or Buddhist inhabitants of Nepal. There is, so far as I am aware, no record of the Buddhist or original in- habitants of Nepal having ever conquered westwaid. 2nd. Acceptance of Colonel Hendley's suggestion would create a dilemma, namely, while in Nepal itself and during its eastward migration, the stupa manifested a progression into many umbrellas, west- ward a reversion took place since, in the region in- dicated, the Tee-like structure has never more than one protecting umbrella. And what is, perhaps, even more cuiious, it is never placed over a stupa , but protects the further extremity, or apse, of a, temple, much as the Jaina-like sanctuary is placed on the top of the many- storied temple oí Pagan. 3rd. If we follow the acceptation of k' pagoda" implied by Professor Macdonell's lecture, namely, a structure that may be defined as a development of the stupa , then there are no pagodas within the country indicated by me, and the word temple had better be substituted. But it is quite customary, both in the Eastern and Western Himalaya, as well as throughout the mountainous frontier ot Assam, to come across commemorative demon or trophy cairns, as also praying cairns, while both in Sikkim and the KLhassi hills relic mounds and memorial stones are common. So also through- out Bengal the habit exists of erecting carved wooden posts in memory of deceased relatives. Thus, it may be said, one of the objects of a stupa , at all events, is very generally upheld in India to the present day. 4th. But the special temples to which I allude are ceitainly not Buddhist, and neither Hindu priests nor Buddhist monks, as a rule, officiate at them. In the extrem? north of the area certain temples, however, are met with where both Hindu and Buddhist wor- ship takes place, under the self-same lools, for ex unple, in the famous temple of Triloknath, in the Upper Chenab Valley. The Buddhism there seen obviously came across the Central Himalaya from Western Tibet, and was thus, as it were, returned to India till it met the wave of Hinduism ascending the valleys. It will thus be seen that I cannot accept Colonel Hendley's suggestion. In other words, I believe that the special art and architecture of the country indicated is purely and simply inoigenous, and has neither been influenced by the Buddhism of Nepal nor by the ancient Buddhism of the plains of India, though it is no doubt a fact that both Buddhism and Hinduism had invaded certain portions of the area, such as the valleys of Kangra and Kashmir.
