<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Defense of Dionysius the Areopagite by Rubens Erick Wilberding The frontispieces of Peter Paul Rubens, collected ten years ago into a corpus by Judson and Van de Velde, have not received as much critical attention as the painted works by the artist. As Julius Held has suggested, the artist sought to present "in allegorical terms, and in a severely limited space, a condensation of the contents of a given book or at least a pictorial equivalent of its basic message."2 Besides the content of the work, certainly the reputation of a given author or book also influenced the choice of symbols, as we see in the frontispiece executed for the Opera S. Dionysii Areopagitae, a translation and vigorous polemic by the Jesuit patrologist Balthasar Cordier.3 In their summary of the iconography Judson and Van de Velde refer to the salient symbols and yet do not record the controversy surrounding Dionysius in the early seventeenth century, although this furor demonstrably influenced the choice of images.4 By examining the 1 J.

The reader is referred to the illustration in the corpus by Judson and Van de Velde. 4 Knipping is mistaken in his study on Baroque iconography when he declares that the debate on Dionysius had subsided by the early seventeenth century, with scholars realizing that the writer of the spiritual works was not the same as the convert of Saint Paul and the martyr venerated in France. As proof for this assertion, Knipping tells us that Dionysius "is not present among the four Eastern Fathers in Rubens' cycle of ceiling-paintings for the Antwerp Jesuit Church: there are represented St. Athanasius, St. Gregory of Nazianzus, St. John Chrysostom and St. Basil the Great" (Iconography of the Counter-Reformation in the Netherlands [Nieuwkoop, 1974], II, 375-76). Besides being unaware of the polemics concerning the saint in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, Knipping also confuses the terms "Father of the Church" and "Doctor of the 19 Copyright 1991 by JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS, INC.</page><page sequence="2">20 Erick Wilberding controversy and by investigating more closely the contents of the Cordier volumes, a more complete understanding of the frontispiece may be ac- quired. In a time when the authenticity of Dionysius was correctly con- tested by Protestants and vigorously defended by Catholics, the artist, as we shall see, crafted a cogent argument in favor of authenticity.5 In the center of the engraving we see Saint Dionysius seated, clothed in an omophorion, supporting a tablet which bears the title to the book. Two angels form the topmost part of the throne. On his left stands Saint Paul, identifiable by his sword, who looks at Dionysius; on Dionysius's right stands Saint Peter who looks toward heaven, his book under his arm, his keys of authority in his right hand. Both saints reach toward Dionysius, Saint Peter as if he were presenting the Greek saint to heaven, Saint Paul as if he were contemplating a friend. Above this group of three saints are the three theological virtues, Faith, Hope, and Charity, each recognizable by its distinctive attribute: Hope bears a lotus blossom and anchor, Faith a cross and chalice, and Charity holds two children. Above this group, ringed by angels, is a downward pointing triangle inscribed Church." Complementing the four Latin Doctors (Saints Ambrose, Augustine, Jerome, and Gregory the Great), Pius V in 1568 recognized the four saints who were depicted on the Antwerp ceiling as being the Four Eastern Doctors (Saints Athanasius, Gregory of Nazianzus, John Chrysostom, and Basil the Great). A Doctor of the Church must manifest "great sanctity, eminent learning, and [be proclaimed] as a Doctor of the Church by a pope or ecumenical council" (The New Catholic Encyclopedia, s.v "Doctor of the Church"). Not to include Dionysius among the Four Eastern Doctors is not a declaration that the Jesuits, or Rubens, doubted him to be among the earliest of saints. 5 There are two works of art concerning the frontispiece: the first is the drawing by Rubens, executed in grey and brownish pigment, heightened with bodycolor over black chalk, which is now preserved at the Ashmolean Museum; see Karl T. Parker, Catalogue of the Collection of Drawings in the Ashmolean Museum (Oxford, 1938), 86-87, no. 202, pl. xliii (Judson and Van de Velde 64a). In this preparatory drawing, we find a few differences in the iconography. Most significantly, the artist, or perhaps the publisher, has chosen to abandon the symbols used at the bottom of the drawing, two circles, one containing the image of an owl within a crown of laurel, the other the head of Athena. On either side of these images we see two mythological animals whose heads have been removed to bear oil lamps. In place of these the engraver has incised the name and place of the publisher, information perhaps originally intended for the tablet that Dionysius supports. This change obviously allows the title greater prominence. The second work is the engraving by Cornelis Galle after the design (Judson and Van de Velde, no. 64). Of course, the discrepancies between the drawing and the engraving raise the question of who made the decision for the finished work of art. Depending on the commission, the role of the artist in designing a frontispiece varied. Typically Rubens took six months, working on Sundays and holidays, to design his works. Naturally the publisher and author each had to approve the final design; however, given the fact that Rubens was a highly educated man, I am assuming that he had much to say about the design of this frontispiece. Parker believes that "the execution of the drawing may not be entirely by Rubens's own hand, but it was certainly carried out under his supervision and with his active cooperation" (87). Judson and Van de Velde suggest that Rubens drew the work, but that the engraver strengthened some details, such as the facial features, with pen and ink (I 276).</page><page sequence="3">Rubens and Dionysius the Areopagite 21 within a circle, from which radiates a brilliant light whose sharp rays descend most directly over Dionysius.6 In the tradition of divinely inspired saints, Dionysius gazes upward into the light. In their brief analysis of this image Judson and Van de Velde identify each of the symbols and go on to explain the presence of Saints Peter and Paul by their relationship to the narrative of Dionysius's life. Saint Paul had corrected the Greek saint's worship of the Virgin Mary, informing him that God alone deserves such adoration, and Saint Peter had sent Dionysius to carry the message of Christianity into Gaul, the land where he eventually was martyred. The two scholars state that Saints Peter and Paul had been depicted by Rubens in an earlier painting in which the saints are seen beneath a portico, suggesting that this perhaps made reference to a vision of Dionysius related in The Golden Legend.7 Moreover, Judson and Van de Velde also acknowledge that Cordier confuses two different saints, one a Dionysius of the first century, the second a missionary of the third century. However, what the scholars have overlooked, or at any rate have failed to mention, is that three separate persons bearing the name Dionysius exist and that Cordier has accepted these three different men as one extraordinary Saint Dionysius, as had been common in the Catholic tradi- tion for several hundred years.8 The first Dionysius, of course, is the saint mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles (17:34). While in Athens Saint Paul delivered a speech to the unconverted people about an altar dedicated to a "God Unknown." Among the few converts was Dionysius, "a member of the court of the Areopagus." The second Dionysius is the missionary who was beheaded at Montmartre, the famous patron of the French royal abbey. The third Dionysius, commonly accepted in the Catholic tradition since the late nineteenth century, after the demonstration by H. Koch and J. Stiglmayr (who each established the fact separately), is a writer of the fifth century who composed several beautiful and enigmatic treatises on mysticism.9 This tripartite identity of Dionysius is highly significant and 6 Judson and Van de Velde merely describe the Trinity symbol as a triangle radiating light (Corpus, I 274). Deborah-Irene Coy, in her entry for the 1977 exhibition Rubens and the Book (89), describes the symbol as "an upside down pyramid, encircled by an aureole." As we shall see, while it may be argued that the symbol is a tetrahedron, it is highly relevant that the symbol should be a triangle within a circle. 7 Ibid. The authors refer to the study by H. Vlieghe, Saints, Corpus Rubenianum Ludwig Burchard, VIII (2 vols., Brussels, 1972-73), I, 67. 8 Deborah-Irene Coy also confuses the issue of the identity of the writer, simply writing (84) that "St. Dionysius Areopagites [sic] (d. 95 A.D.) was an early Christian theologian and first bishop of Athens." The significance of this extraordinary writer in the seventeenth century is not addressed. 9 For bibliography see Pseudo-Dionysius: The Complete Works, tr.

When Rubens received his commission in the early 1630s, doubts concerning the authen- ticity of Dionysius were both well established and well known. In examining the frontispiece, several questions suggest themselves. Why would Rubens, whom Wittkower acknowledges felt close to the Jesuits?1 and whom Erik Larsen and Vernon Hyde Minor declare to be a Jesuit-educated, Jesuit-guided artist,1 include such an abstract, non- anthropomorphic symbol as a triangle inscribed within a circle for the Trinity? Why, in other words, is this symbol especially appropriate for Dionysius? Why are the three theological virtues included in the frontis- piece, and why are they out of order, with Faith, not Hope, placed in the center?12 Do Saints Peter and Paul have any relevance other than the link with the biography proposed by Judson and Van de Velde? An investiga- tion of each of these questions will demonstrate that the image is a wonder- fully succinct statement of the importance of Dionysius to the Catholic theology of the early seventeenth century. What is more, it will demon- strate that the image is an eloquent polemic for the acceptance of a traditional view of Dionysius, a view that fuses the three separate persons into one, forming the image of a biblical missionary who wrote Neopla- tonic treatises on mysticism. The history of the reputation of Pseudo-Dionysius, marked by fervent commentaries and vitriolic denunciations, is nearly as enthralling as the writer's own works. In the ninth century Louis the Pious asked Hilduin, abbot of Saint Denys, to compose a biography of the patron of the abbey and the monk responded with the Passio sanctissimi Dionysii, a work which braids three strands of biography, the apostolic saint, the martyr, the Neoplatonic writer, creating the Dionysius whom Cordier later re- XIV (Paris, 1960), 290-303, and "Denys l'Areopagite (Le Pseudo-)," Dictionnaire de Spiritualite, IV (Paris, 1957), 244-430. 10 Rudolph Wittkower and Irma B.

Undoubtedly from the habit of hearing the three chimed in correct sequence, Rooses in his description quickly writes that "on voit la Foi, l'Esperance et la Charite, symbolisees par trois femmes," not men- tioning the new order given by Rubens: L'Oeuvre de P. P. Rubens, 1886-1892 (Soest, Holland, 1977), V, 74, no. 1266. Similarly, Evers does not remark on the change of order and in fact writes of the "christliche Tugenden, Glaube, Liebe und Hoffnung," providing a new arrangement that is neither found in Saint Paul nor in the frontispiece; H. G. Evers, Rubens und sein Werk, neue Forschungen (Brussels, 1943), 187. Deborah-Irene Coy mentions the new arrangement (Rubens and the Book, 84).</page><page sequence="5">Rubens and Dionysius the Areopagite 23 vered so deeply.13 This confusion remained virtually unchallenged in the West, save for the isolated warning of Abelard, until the fifteenth century. In the intervening centuries, his works translated and dispersed through- out Europe, Pseudo-Dionysius extended roots deeply into the soil of reli- gious imagination and thought. 14 Perhaps most significant for the purposes of this thesis is the enthusiasm about the Neoplatonic writer on the part of Thomas Aquinas, who wrote a commentary on the treatise on The Divine Names and often cited the Greek writer in his other works.15 It is not surprising that in the fifteenth century many Italian Neoplatonic philosophers were attracted by the calm and profound doctrine of Pseudo-Dionysius and found in him the bridge between the pagan and Christian philosophies. Ambrogio Traversari translated the entire corpus, and Marsilio Ficino, besides translating The Divine Names and The Mysti- cal Theology, also commented on these works. Furthermore, several writ- ers later important to the Jesuits, men such as Denis the Carthusian and John Gerson, composed commentaries on the treatises.16 For many writers the Areopagite represented the most sublime ascent to God. For others of the fifteenth century, however, the authenticity of Diony- sius was not at all certain. As Monfasani has demonstrated, a group of humanists became aware of doubts in the Eastern Tradition, as expressed in a colloquy by Hypatius of Ephesus, a passage in Photius's Bibliotheca, and in a sentence in the commentary by Maximus the Confessor on the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy.17 Lorenzo Valla was the first to express freely 13 Panofsky, in a famous essay, discusses the influence of Dionysius on the later construction by Abbot Suger; see Abbot Suger and the Abbey Church of St.-Denis and its Art Treasures (2nd ed.; Princeton, 1979), 18-21.

Paula Lieber Gerson (New York, 1986), 33-40. 14 Cappuyns writes that "since the period of John Scotus Eriugena (who died toward 870), there has been practically no thinker, philosopher, theologian, or mystic who is not in some manner dependent on Pseudo-Dionysius" (295). 15 For the influence of Pseudo-Dionysius on Saint Thomas, see Joseph Turbessi, "Saint Thomas d'Aquin," "Denys L'Areopagite: En Occident," Dictionnaire de Spiritualit6, 349-56. 16 Joseph de Guibert, S.J., La Spiritualitk de la Compagnie de Jesus: esquisse historique (Rome, 1953).

Maximus the Confessor rejected the doubt concerning Dionysius but does mention that some wished to attribute the corpus to Apollinaris.</page><page sequence="6">24 Erick Wilberding his reservations about the identity of the saint;18 in his commentary on the New Testament, later edited by Erasmus, the passage in the Acts of the Apostles concerning the conversion of the saint becomes the peg on which Valla hangs a list of questions. He mentions the Neoplatonic charac- ter of the works, the silence of Eusebius and Jerome on the existence of the corpus, the disturbing fact that the dispersion of the texts can only be traced to the sixth century, and he finally declares that many contempo- rary scholars wish to attribute the corpus to Apollinaris.19 When Erasmus finally published his own annotated New Testament in 1516, he recalled the objections of Valla and contributed two more, namely, that the biblical areopagites were judges, not philosophers, and that the description of rituals found in the corpus was too sophisticated for the primitive church.20 In the second edition, published in 1519, Erasmus noted that William Grocyn had also expressed doubts in a series of lectures in London.21 Because Dionysius was often used by Catholic polemicists to establish the divine ordering of the Church, these highly articulate doubts, which gnawed at the foundation of apostolic authority, were repeated by the Protestant reformers, including Luther and Zwingli.22 Perhaps most im- portantly, the primary historian for the reformers, Flacius Illyricus, also supported Erasmus's claim, adding to the attack by mentioning Diony- sius's apparent use of the Stromata of Clement of Alexandria. Aubert writes that "from that moment the apocryphal character of the writings of Dionysius was not even believed to be worth debating by the Protes- tants."23 These Protestant scholars, free from the burden of defending the hierarchy of the church, easily embraced the truth that Dionysius was not authentically apostolic. Once the reputation of Dionysius had been assaulted, there was no lack of Catholic defenders. In every country in Europe tracts appeared to testify to the reliability of the saint's writings, and the French, driven by a fusion of nationalistic and religious ardor, were particularly vehement.24 Most germane for this article is the defense by Caesar Baronius, the most important Catholic historian of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.25 For Baronius to defend the apostolic origins of Dionysius 18 Erasmus published the notes under the title, Laurentii Vallensis... in latinam Novi Testamenti interpretationem ex collatione graecorum exemplarium Adnotationes (Paris, 1505); Aubert, 296. 19 This list of characteristics is summarized by Aubert (ibid.). 20 Aubert, 297. 21 Monfasani, 190 and n.4. 22Aubert mentions Luther's change of heart over Dionysius, and how Zwingli quoted Erasmus (297-98). 23 Aubert, 298. 24 For a list of the many defenders, see Aubert 298-99. 25 Emile Male calls Baronius "le grand historien de l'Eglise" (L'Art Religieux de la Fin du XVIe Siecle, du XVIIe Siecle, et du XVIIIe Siecle [Paris, 1951], 68). See Cyriac Pullapilly, Caesar Baronius, Counter-Reformation Historian (Notre Dame, Ind., 1975);</page><page sequence="7">Rubens and Dionysius the Areopagite 25 was tantamount to papal approval. In the early seventeenth century the publication of new translations of the corpus first by Lanssel and later by Cordier signaled further approval, for both were members of the Jesuit order, which often wielded papal authority.26 Indeed, Dionysius's writings were not used defensively but on the contrary were aggressively quoted to defend the ancientness of Catholic practices and doctrine. Aubert in- forms us that "during the first decades of the seventeenth century, the authority of the Areopagite was not contested by Catholic theologians and apologists."27 For the Catholic defenders it was greatly significant, as Balthasar Cordier himself proudly points out, that Thomas Aquinas had made liberal use of the Greek author's works, for Aquinas was the most highly praised theologian of the Counter-Reformation.28 Pius V proclaimed him a Doctor of the Church in 1567, lauding him as "the most brilliant light of the Church."29 Nearly forty years later Clement VIII went further and stated that no error could be discovered in his works.30 In 1614 Paul V called him "the defender of the Catholic Church and conqueror of here- tics."31 The Jesuits, it should be noted, were quite active in disseminating the doctrine of Aquinas, especially as interpreted by the brilliant and prolific Francesco Suarez.32 Therefore, we can see that Dionysius occupied a special place for the conservative Catholic authorities. Not to accept Dionysius as authentic was to question the most eminent theologian of the Church, Thomas Aquinas. Not to accept Dionysius as authentic was also to question a writer who often was used in the debates at Trent as a justification for the hierarchical structure of the Church which placed the pope at his pinnacle and for the importance of Baronius with regard to the arts, Elizabeth Cropper and Charles Dempsey, "The State of Research in Italian Painting of the Seventeenth Century," Art Bulletin, 69 (1987), 505. They also mention two collections, Baronio storico e la Controri- forma: Atti del Convegno Internazionale di Studi, Fonti e studi Baroniani, I, ed. R. de Maio, L. Giulia, A.

R. de Maio (Sora, 1985), 505, n. 62, tracing the influence of the Cardinal in both the visual arts and in music. Rubens designed a frontispiece for the Annales (Judson and Van de Velde, no. 53). 26 Aubert comments that "the sole fact that these were two Jesuit theologians, Fathers Lanssel and Cordier, who produced major translations of the corpus, is indicative of the interest that the works of the Areopagite continued to command" (304). 27 Aubert, 304. 28 Cordier includes a long index of the places in Aquinas's works where the Angelic Doctor supported himself with references to Dionysius (see PG, III, 88-96). 29 The New Catholic Encyclopedia, "Thomas Aquinas." 30 Ibid. 31 Ibid. 32 Suarez was born in Lisbon in 1548, entered the Society in 1564, died in 1617, and wrote, among other works, an enormous commentary on the Summa of St. Thomas; for a brief overview of his career, see New Catholic Encyclopedia, "Francesco Suarez."</page><page sequence="8">26 Erick Wilberding of power.33 The need to defend Dionysius, then, was keenly felt by Catholic hierarchy of the early seventeenth century. With this understanding of the place of Dionysius in the thought of the Catholic church of the early Baroque period, it becomes easier to assess the importance of the translation by Balthasar Cordier.34 His com- pendium of translations, lives of the saint, and additional commentary functions very clearly as prolonged and passionate polemic, drawing upon both Eastern and Western sources, in favor of the supposedly apostolic saint. Since several scholars have drawn attention to the fact that Rubens attempted in his frontispieces to reproduce in visual terms the contents of a given work, it is worthwhile and indeed essential to examine the contents of the Cordier volumes. Cordier first wrote two brief essays as introductions to the works so that the reader might fully appreciate the sublime wisdom of Dionysius.35 His purpose in his "Observationes" is to reveal the scriptural basis for much of what Dionysius claims. He also takes pains to reveal the similari- ties in doctrine between Dionysius and other revered saints, such as Saint Basil the Great, Saint Bernard, and Saint Thomas Aquinas.36 In his pas- sion for the works of Dionysius, Cordier in his eleventh observation even goes so far as to assert that Dionysius is the first author of scholastic theology.37 In Cordier's "Isagoge ad mysticam theologiam S. Dionysii Areopagi- tae" there is an attempt to explain the basic mysticism of Dionysius, which is described as "experienced wisdom ... a divine infusion, purifying the mind ... and through supernatural acts of faith, hope and charity [the 33 For example, in the discussion on the sacrament of ordination on November 16, 1562, one bishop declared that "Dixit Dionysius....Deus ordinem divinitus institutum conservare et omnes suo in officio: papam, episcopos, sacerdotes et alios omnes illuminare dignaretur"; Concilium Tridentinum Diariorum, ed. Sebastian Merkle (Freiburg, 1965), II, 726. Other prelates in the discussion quote from the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, 762, 771. 34 Born at Antwerp in 1592, Cordier entered the Society in 1612; and after teaching Greek for three years and moral theology for eight, he taught scripture in Vienna and in 1650 died in Rome (Carlos Sommervogel, Bibliotheque de la Compagnie de Jesus, Premiere partie, Bibliographie par Les PP. Augustin et Aloys de Backer, Nouvelle edition, Index par Bliard [12 vols., Heverle-Louvain, 1960], II, 1438-43). During his life time he edited several collections of the writings on the Fathers, one of which, Catena Sexaginta Graec- orum Patrum in S. Lucam, published in Antwerp in 1628, was illustrated by Rubens; see Judson and Van de Velde, I, 249-53, nos. 58 and 58a. The artist also designed a vignette for the title page of Cordier's Catena Patrum Graecorum in S. Ioannem, published in Antwerp in 1630; see Judson and Van de Velde, I, 253-55, n.59 and 59a. 35 Cordier's "Observationes Generales Pro Faciliori Intelligentia S. Dionysii" is re- printed in PG, III, 77-96, and 95-108, "Ad Mystica Theologiam S. Dionysii Areopagitae." 36 For example, he compares a passage from Dionysius with a passage on the attributes of God taken from Bernard's De consideratione (PG, III, 83-84). For the comparison with Aquinas, see PG, III, 86; for Basil the Great, PG, III, 87-88. 37 "S. Dionysius primus auctor theologiae scholasticae" (PG, III, 85).</page><page sequence="9">Rubens and Dionysius the Areopagite 27 soul] is intimately joined to God."38 This essay is a more sustained and interesting account of the dynamics of Dionysian mysticism as understood in the early seventeenth century. For Cordier the special kind of prayer that Dionysius advocates represents the most purifying means for the soul to reach God, and those to whom it is granted are highly blessed.39 Somewhat surprisingly, in view of the difference in spiritual outlooks between the Carmelites and the Jesuits, or in other words between a contemplative and an active order, Cordier at one point lavishes praise upon the modern exemplar of Dionysian mysticism, John of the Cross, "rerum mysticarum expertissimus." The contents of the rest of the volume are culled from a variety of sources, Eastern and Western, in an effort to show the reverence accorded to Dionysius in two very old and deeply rooted traditions. Cordier takes the scholia of Saint Maximus, a figure from the seventh century, as well as the saint's more extended commentary on the works of Dionysius.40 These works succeeded in slipping the ideas of Dionysius into the larger stream of Byzantine theology.41 From George Pachymeres, a medieval Byzantine historian who died in Constantinople c. 1310, Cordier takes his "proemium" as well as his "paraphrasis."42 Other shorter writings from the Byzantine tradition are quoted by Cordier.43 From the western tradition, in order to support his case for Dionysius even further, Cordier includes several works also written by Jesuits. A lengthy life of the saint as well as a polemical work written by his confrere Pierre Halloix. In his polemical work Halloix very directly addresses the questions of the identity of Dionysius and the character of his works, drawing upon the writings of the early Greek and Latin Fathers.44 To 38 "Theologica mystica est sapientia experimentalis, Dei affectiva, divinitus infusa, quae mentem ab omni inordinatione puram, per actus supernaturales fidei, spei et chari- tatis, cum Deo intime conjungit" (PG, III, 97). 39 The places where Cordier becomes quite excited about the intimate contact possible with God are quite numerous; e.g., after detailing the special grace given, he exclaims, "O felicem illam horam!" "O happy is that hour!" (PG, III, 107). 40 These are reproduced in PG, IV, 15-432, 527-75. M. Hermaniuk tells us that the scholia are no longer regarded as authentic (New Catholic Encyclopedia, s.v. "Saint Max- imus the Confessor"). 41 "Pseudo-Dionysius is taken into the Greek Church through Maximus," writes A. Ehrhard. "Pseudodionys ist durch Maximos in die griechische Kirche eingefuhrt worden" (quoted in Dictionnaire de Spiritualite, 295). 42 New Catholic Encyclopedia, "George Pachymeres." The "Proemium" is reproduced in PG, III, 107-16, the "Paraphrasis" to the works in PG, III, following the notes that Cordier appended to the text, and the "Paraphrasis" to the letters in PG, IV, 433-510. 43 Space disallows my describing of each of these works. 44 "De S. Dionysii Vita et Operibus Quaestiones Quatuor," PG, IV, 869-954. The first question concerns the identity of Dionysius as both disciple of Paul and Bishop of Paris and the second the works of Dionysius, the third demonstrates that Timothy, to whom Dionysius addresses many of his works, was indeed the disciple of Saint Paul, and the fourth question concerns the place of the body of the Dionysius.</page><page sequence="10">28 Erick Wilberding buttress many of his assertions, Halloix frequently refers to the lives and commentaries written by the Greek Fathers.45 Cordier also includes the polemical works written by the Jesuits Martin Delrio and Peter Lanssel. These works compile daunting lists of the erudite men of the past, many of them saints and important to the thought of the Church, who quote Dionysius and comment on the wisdom of his works.46 From this we can see that the "translation" by Cordier, which was dedicated to a Jesuit Cardinal active in the Counter-Reformation,47 was in reality much more than a simple new Latin version of the works of the saint with a helpful onomasticon. Given the stringent criticism of the Protestants, the Jesuit felt compelled to answer by collecting the writings of the Byzantine tradition, which extended its roots several centuries beyond the birth of Protestantism. By using the writings of revered Byzan- tine historians and saints, as well as by showing the parallels and bor- rowings in the Western Fathers, especially in the works of Aquinas, Cordier must have felt he had constructed an unassailable argument in favor of the legitimacy of Saint Dionysius the Areopagite. This unassailable argument is what Rubens wished to duplicate in visual terms when he began to plan his frontispiece for the works of Dionysius. As mentioned above, the most extraordinary and seemingly uncharacteristic symbol of the frontispiece is the triangle inscribed within a circle. On examination the abstract symbol is entirely appropriate for Dionysius, because its origin is within the history of Platonic and Pytha- gorean philosophy, a history which was well known in Rubens's day.48 For Pythagoras, renowned as the man who transported geometry from Egypt to Greece, numbers were "the ultimate constituents of reality."49 45 For example, see PG, III, 709. 46 Martin Delrio, "Vindiciis Areopagiticis," PG, III, 953-82. Peter Lanssel, "De S. Dionysio Areopagita Ejusque Scriptis Disputation Apologetica," PG, III, 981-1012. 47 The volumes are dedicated to Franz Cardinal Dietrichstein, Bishop of Olmutz, a diocese in Moravia. During the Reformation, Protestantism was well-received by the Moravians, and the Jesuits worked assiduously to regain the populace. Dietrichstein is called "the most important bishop of this see" during the early seventeenth century; see The Catholic Encyclopedia [1911], "Olmutz." 48 The literature on the symbol of the triangle is not extensive but as yet has not been unified within a single examination. The most helpful articles are the following: J. J. M. Timmers, "Dreieck," Lexicon de Christlichen Ikonographie, ed. Engelbert Kirschbaum, S.J. (Rome, 1968), A. Stuiber, "Dreieck," Reallexikon fur Antike und Christentum, ed. Theodor Klauser (Stuttgart, 1959), and especially Richard Teufel, "Dreieck," Reallexikon zur Deutchen Kunstgeschichte (Stuttgart, 1958)-all, however, making mention of Georg Stuhlfauth, Das Dreieck, Die Geschichte eines religiosen Symbols (Stuttgart, 1937). Note that in a depiction of the Trinity, the symbol of the triangle is used as the nimbus of God the Father; see the engraving by Cornelis Galle after a drawing by the master, "La Gloria Celeste dei Beati," Rubens e l'Incisione, exh. cat., 1977, Villa della Farnesina alla Lungara, Roma, no. 14. 49 On Pythagoras see S.

What is especially relevant to our discussion is that Pythagoras was also famous as the discoverer of the five regular solids, the tetrahedron, octohedron, cube, icosahedron, and dodecahedron. The first of these, the tetrahedron or pyramid, which is produced by interlocking triangles, is composed of four points. This was the first possible three-dimensional form and was associated with the element of fire. 0 Because of its association with the numbers four and ten, the triangle was held in great esteem. Pythagorean doctrine concerning the cosmos and the governing ratios, together with the doctrine of the regular solids, is expressed in Plato's Timaeus (53C-55C). Later it was Xenocrates who proposed that an equilateral triangle was a symbol for divinity.51 Although in the time of Saint Augustine the symbol was associated with the Manichean heresy, by the fifteenth century its Trinitarian mean- ing was well known. In the early seventeenth century, intellectuals were well aware of the great antiquity of the image. For example, the symbol and its significance in antiquity were commented on by Valerianus in his famous work, Hieroglyphica, a book owned by the artist.52 From these facts, we can assume that the artist was entirely conscious of choosing a highly appropriate symbol to represent the Trinity for Dionysius the Areopagite. Dionysius does not comment at all on the triangle as symbol of God, but nonetheless he was a Greek who according to the legend had lived for a short period in Egypt.53 Halloix declares that Dionysius was highly educated and indeed had travelled to Egypt in the same way that Pythagoras, Plato, and other eminent men of learning had done.54 Given the fact that Dionysius was considered an educated Platonist convert and someone suspicious of anthropomorphic symbolism,55 the choice of the triangle seems completely appropriate. 50 Each solid was associated with one of the four elements; the fifth, the dodecahedron, was regarded as the sum of all the previous solids and represented the heavens in eternity (Heninger, 107). For Dionysius, despite his abundant use of the metaphor of light, the metaphor of fire was best suited for representing how the angels seem like God; Celestial Hierarchy, XV, 2 (183). 51 See Plutarch, def. orac., 31 (Stuiber, 310). 52 An analysis of the library of Rubens was undertaken by Sigrid von Hoyingen-Huene MacRae in Rubens'Library (M.A. Thesis, Columbia University, 1965). Valerianus's Hiero- glyphica, a study of the symbols used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, is mentioned as being in the library of the artist in the edition printed at Lyons, 1610 (125, no. 301). For Valerianus's commentary on the Triangle, see Les Hieroglyphiques (Lyons, 1615), 520-23. 53 Dionysius in his seventh letter speaks of having been in Heliopolis, where he wit- nesses an eclipse at the time of the crucifixion of Christ (Letter Seven, 2 [268]). Halloix includes a diagram of the eclipse in his vita which is reproduced in Cordier (PG, IV, 705-6). 54 Halloix mentions this early on in his account (PG, IV, 698). 55 Dionysius speaks of the problem of symbolism and God in The Celestial Hierarchy (II, 1-5 [147-53]). This is briefly discussed in an article by E. H. Gombrich, "Icones</page><page sequence="12">30 Erick Wilberding As mentioned above, it is quite significant that the triangle should be inscribed within a circle. Not commented on by Judson and Van de Velde, this symbol seems entirely appropriate for Pseudo-Dionysius. In examining the writings of Dionysius, we can see that diversity within unity is a fundamental Dionysian concept. Unity emanated from the Trinity to all of creation. The triangle with its three equal sides obviously represents diversity, while the circle, by unifying all within its unbroken contour, symbolizes the unifying influence of God. The fact that the circle is defined by darkness also is significant, because the passage through darkness, beyond the senses, is again a fundamental Dionysian concept, and Rubens has expressed this with admirable subtlety. Moreover, it was well known that the circle was an ancient image and known to the Egyp- tians as a symbol of eternity.56 However, it must be noted that for the artist the circle may have had more meaning within this work. In 1983 Jeffrey Muller published a short article on the entry Rubens contributed to the Album Amicorum of Philips van Valckenisse, an eminent businessman and collector of Antwerp.57 Within this friendship book, Rubens very simply drew a circle with a compass, dotted its center, and wrote above the symbol, "Medio Deus omnia campo," or "God is all things in the middle of the field,"58 an abbreviated quotation from Lucan. Muller traces the belief of Plato and Cicero, which was known to Rubens and recorded in his theoretical notebook, that the circle was the most beautiful of all forms, for it ex- pressed the divine harmony. Basing himself on the work of Mahnke, Muller follows this belief through Hermes Trismegistus and Marsilio Ficino,59 overlooking the fact that Dionysius, so highly praised and valued by Ficino, also assimilated the Platonic concept and wrote ardently of this symbol within his works. For example, in The Divine Names he writes: He is yearning on the move, simple, self-moved, self-acting, preexistent in the Good, flowing out from the Good onto all that is and returning once again to the Good. In this divine yearning shows especially its unbeginning and unending nature traveling in an endless circle through the Good, from the Good, in the Good and to the Good, unerringly turning, ever on the same center, ever in the same direction, always proceeding, always remaining, always being restored to itself.60 Symbolicae: Philosophies of Symbolism and their Bearing on Art," Symbolic Images: Studies in the Art of the Renaissance (London, 1972), 150-51. 56 Valerianus, 512. 57 Jeffrey Muller, "Rubens' Divine Circle," Ringling Museum of Art Journal, 1 (1983), 220-25. 58 De Bello Civili (VII, 348); see Muller, 220. 59 Dietrich Mahnke, Unendliche Sphare und Allmittelpunkt (Halle, 1937).

Elsewhere in his theoretical notebook Rubens wrote that "God is the harmony of all things. A circle including all, Outside of which there is nothing."62 It is true, as Muller comments, that Rubens embraced a Platonic concept of beauty revealing "a strong faith in the imminence of God and in the divine order of the universe,"63 but we can plausibly suggest that the artist was familiar with this consoling belief and metaphor because of the writings of Dionysius the Areopagite, which were certainly well known even before the appearance of Cordier's translation.64 Judson and Van de Velde have commented on the division of the frontispiece into three distinct zones, with the Virtues in the center zone. For the two scholars, the first two zones of this division relate very clearly to Dionysius's Celestial Hierarchy, part of which they claim is "devoted to the nine orders of angels and to the heavenly virtues."65 Given the constraints of the Corpus, the scholars do not further elaborate on this declaration, and the reader is left with the impression that the three theological virtues figure highly within the thought of Dionysius. However, it must be stated that Dionysius does not mention these as one of his triads and, moreover, does not devote any chapter of the Celestial Hierarchy to the theological virtues. Therefore the depiction of the theological virtues in the frontispiece is at first puzzling. For Dionysius the chain of enlightenment descends very distinctly from God to angels to men. Nonetheless, the artist has very consciously placed these three virtues between heaven and earth; further, he has placed them out of order, having Faith in the center, as if to say that they do intercede between the human and the divine.66 Why did the artist choose this design? To answer this question we must refer to Cordier's interpretation of the doctrine of Pseudo-Dionysius. Within Cordier's fervent explanation of Dionysian thought, "Isagoge ad mysticam theologiam S. Dionysii Areo- pagitae," we find a brief passage that is worth quoting in its entirety: 61 For another example, see Divine Names, II, 4 (62). 62 "MS De Ganay, collection of the Marquis de Ganay, Paris: fol. v " 'Deus Harmonia rerum omnium,/Circulus includens omnia,/Extra quem nihil est' " (quoted in Muller, 221 and 224 n. 19). 63 Muller, 220. 64 Muller does date the entry to shortly before 1600, that is, before the trip to Italy (220). 65 Judson and Van de Velde, I, 274. 66 Normally, if these virtues are depicted together, they follow the order given in Saint Paul; see M. Evans, "Tugenden," Lexikon de Christlichen Ikonographie, ed. Engelbert Kirschbaum, S.J. (Rome, 1972).</page><page sequence="14">32 Erick Wilberding A further end of this wisdom as close and sweet a union with God as can be obtained in this life; the means of obtaining this are the supernatural theological acts of faith, hope, and charity. [By these virtues] the mind immediately touches God, darkly but certainly through faith, suspended by hope, perfected by charity. Faith, since it certainly is "the conviction about things not seen,"67 is certainly the same mystical darkness celebrated by Saint Paul and Saint Dionysius, as can be seen in the first two chapters of the Mystical Theology and in the fifth letter to Dorotheus, along with our notes to those works. Hope, since it truly deals with things not yet possessed, suspends the soul in a certain way with expectation and desire of those same things.68 Lastly there is charity; since it is the bond of perfection, it most happily joins the soul to God.69 As faith informs the mind, hope informs the memory, and charity informs the will and emotions, and all are perfected mystically. Thus by these most excellent theological virtues, the entire mystical theology is perfectly and essentially contained. 70 (emphasis mine) What the artist has done, in other words, is to articulate in visual terms Cordier's interpretation of the theological virtues. Cordier sees all of the mystical doctrine of Dionysius, that is, the Dionysian vision of the soul's rapport with God, as compressed within a certain understanding of these three virtues. Rubens thus stresses the fact that the writings of Dionysius are chiefly concerned with describing the means by which humanity receives knowledge of divinity. Why is the virtue of Faith placed out of order? As we have seen in the brief exposition on Dionysian thought, which is so much preoccupied with a dark knowledge of God, the virtue of faith is emphasized. For Cordier this also is true. For instance, in his definition of Dionysian mysticism the first term that issues from his pen is "theologica mystica 67 Migne provides the footnote reference here to Hebrews 11:1. "Faith is constant assurance concerning what we hope for, and conviction about things we do not see" (this and other translations taken from The New American Bible [New York, 1970]. 68 Migne's reference here is to Romans 8:24: "In hope we were saved. But hope is not hope if its object is seen: how is it possible for one to hope for what one sees?" 69 Cordier here uses the word "conjungere," which relates to the bond of marriage, in order to express the intensity of the experience. 70PG, III, 97-98: "Porro finis per hancce sapientiam intentus, est unio cum Deo, quanta nimirum potest in hac vita obtineri, arctissima et suavissimaque. Media vero hujus obtinendae sunt actus theologici supernaturales, fidei, spei et charitatis, quibus immediate mens Deum attingit, per fidem scilicet caliginose, per spem suspense, per charitatem perfecte. Fides enim cum sit argumentum non apparentium, est caligo ista mystica S. Paulo et S. Dionysio adeo celebrata, de qua vide cap. 1 et 2 Myst. theol., et epist. 5 ad Dorotheum, atque ibidem nostras adnotationes. Spes vero cum sit rerum quae necdum possidentur, earumdem exspectatione ac desiderio animum quodammodo suspendit, atque ita per illam mystica fit suspensio. Charitas denique, cum sit vinculum perfectionis, cum ipso Deo animam felicissime conjungit. Ac fides quidem intellectum, spes memoriam, charitas voluntatem et affectum supra naturam mystice perficit et informat, ita tribus istis excel- lentissimis virtutum theologicarum actibus, totius mysticae theolgiae perfectio et essentia contineatur...." The passage goes on to praise Saint John of the Cross and his works, The Ascent of Mount Carmel and The Dark Night of the Soul.</page><page sequence="15">Rubens and Dionysius the Areopagite 33 est sapientia experimentalis," or "the mystical theology is experienced wisdom."71 The concern with wisdom is paramount, and as we have just read in the short passage quoted above, the virtue of faith especially concerns the intellect. Therefore, we can suggest that the artist is express- ing the same emphasis on wisdom and knowledge by placing the virtue of faith in the center, out of its characteristic order. The frontispiece thereby also testifies strongly that Dionysius himself possessed this unique knowledge, a point yet further underscored by the inclusion of two angels on either side of the topmost part of the throne. Saints Peter and Paul are obviously quite important to the representa- tion of Dionysius. As Judson and Van de Velde have pointed out, each saint is linked to Dionysius through biographical ties, a fact very impor- tant to the apologists.72 However, once the biographical ties are admitted, the representation of Peter and Paul in the frontispiece can be examined from another angle. In other frontispieces designed for the Church, specifi- cally those for the Roman Breviary and for a translation of the Annales of Baronius, we see that Saints Peter and Paul are situated on either side of the design, in this way signifying the approval and authority of the Church. Visually, therefore, much more is intended than friendship in the frontispiece for the works of Dionysius when we see that Peter and Paul are flanking the controversial saint. As we have seen, the works of Diony- sius were considered as crucial to the writings of Thomas Aquinas, as well as to the establishment of apostolic authority descending through the clergy. Visually, Saints Peter and Paul establish the authority of the Church: they validate, in a circular argument, the reputation of the saint whose apocryphal writings were regarded as necessary, among other writ- ings and traditions, for validating that very same papal authority. From this examination, we have seen that the Cordier volumes present an intriguing contribution to the theology of the early seventeenth century. In designing the iconography of the frontispiece, Rubens was assuredly guided by the interpretation of the Catholic apologists. The placement of the theological virtues in the middle zone, bonding the earthly to the heavenly, clearly expresses the interpretation by Cordier given in his preface, "Isagoge ad mysticam theologiam S. Dionysii." For Cordier, the theological virtues compress the entire mystical theology. The geometric 71 PG, III, 97. 72 For example, Halloix declares that "it is sinful to doubt that the Apostle Paul, the Doctor to the Gentiles, was the instructor of Dionysius." "Quin Paulus apostolus et doctor gentium, praeceptor S. Dionysii Areopagitae fuerit, nefas est dubitare" (PG, IV, 738, n. 50). Halloix mentions this story (PG, IV, 769, n. 94), which also is related in the Golden Legend (Jacobus Voragine, The Golden Legend, ed. F. S. Ellis, tr. William Caxton [New York, 1973], 251). After Peter's death, Clement succeeds him and it is Clement who sends Dionysius to Gaul (PG, IV, 779).</page><page sequence="16">34 Erick Wilberding image of God is charged with Platonism, a philosophy which the artist himself found appealing. The placement of Saints Peter and Paul on either side of the controver- sial Saint Dionysius is a powerful statement of the approval of the church for the authenticity of Dionysius, a saint whose writings had been quoted often in the works of Saint Thomas Aquinas as well as in the debates of the Council of Trent. While Protestant scholars, following Valla and Erasmus, expressed skepticism about the saint, this appeared to many Catholic theologians as an attempt to undermine the foundation of the Church. Cordier's two volumes of translations, lives and commentaries were intended as a powerful declaration of the deep wisdom and value of Dionysius, whose mystical experience, the Jesuit writes, was not abstruse and cerebral but rather suffused the believer's life, whether he was eating or drinking, awake or asleep.73 Adhering to this essentially medieval devotion, which ignores the cogent criticisms of Valla and Erasmus, Ru- bens has visually duplicated Cordier's polemic by sensitively but unambig- uously selecting images that strongly assert the antiquity and authenticity of the Areopagite.
