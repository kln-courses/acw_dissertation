Schweizer Basel The Gorgon Notes and documents relating to the 66 Prolegomena zu einer historischen Gestaltlehre" by Leo Frobenius The amphora of Nessus in the Archaeological Museum of Athens (1) has preserved for us one of the traditional images of the Gorgon. The monster, fitted out with two great wings, is represented in the customary posture of the ritual race (corsa in ginocchio) found in many of the designs coming from Western Asia, in which Frobenius identified the solar motif of the swastica (2). The Gorgon's head is broad and flattened and ends in a kind of conventionalised mane. The enormous mouth with prominent fangs and protruding tongue, wide nostrils and round staring eyes, give the head a bestial expression. An image closely resembling this is painted on a scyphus decorated with black patterns belong? ing to the Robinson collection (3). Frobenius identifies in this portrayal of the Gorgon the motifs of the lion, the eagle, the serpent and the bird, pertaining to the arche? typal imagery of prehistoric Europe and of Africa fused together in the mythical concep? tion corresponding to related emotions, in conformity with the characteristic features of the rhythmological environment. The correct? ness of these observations becomes more evident if the image described above be com? pared to that on a large amphora coming from the necropolis of Eleusis (4). The conventio? nal head of the monster is roundish in shape, flattened at the poles and divided into two halves by the horizontal line of the mouth in which the teeth are suggested. The eyes are drawn obliquely at the upper ends of the head, and a stepped triangle represents the nose. Immediately above it, and running the whole length of the triangle, is a circle of small deco? rative patterns. This strange head is fixed to a rather long neck, on either side of which rise a couple of serpents with lowered heads, two other ser? pents occupy the corresponding position on a level with the mouth. While we have a frontal view of the head, the body of the Gorgon is seen in profile. The chest is square with rounded corners and the arms are stretched forwards. The only clothing worn by the monster is a long skirt, tied at the waist, falling over the leg drawn back as she steps. The solar symbolism of the frontal view of the lion is evidently found again in the Gor? gon; but it would perhaps be unduly restric? tive in an Asian work to attribute this meaning to the fontal view only, although this frontal view expresses very clearly the characteristic features of that symbol. That same motif that Frobenius noted also in the representation of an astral phenomenon commonly known as that of the plunderer (predatore) may indeed lend itself to such an interpretation, if we also take into account the fact that examples exist of a frontal view of predatory animals. I should like to note in this connection a Byzantine basrelief embedded in the rear wall of the Ancient Metropolis of Athens, repre? senting a frontal view of a felid (a lion) attacking an animal that looks like a deer (?). The representations of the frontal view of lions, mentioned by Frobenius, have much in common with the felid in this basrelief. I may therefore speak of solar symbolism both in the case of representations of felids seen in a frontal position and for those seen in profile in special designs, and this state? ment is justified by the alternation of frontal 88</page><page sequence="2">and profile views as well as by the analogy between these positions and those of the repre? sentatives of the predatory animals. But it is in the Corinthian ceramics that we find quite frequently images of more or less fantastic animals with a frontal view of a lion's face, matched by representations of roaring lions seen in profile. An olpe preserved in the Etruscan museum in Florence (5) is decorated with animals arranged in four rows (registri). We find there examples of both modes of representa? tion. We would mention as prototypes of fontal representation, the aryballoi of the Louvre (E 436) and of the University of Dunedin, an amphora in the Art Gallery of Yale University, some goblets and ampho riskoi. Some of the aryballoi of Florence and famous alabaster belonging to Yale Univer? sity (6) are decorated with felids presented in profile. This parallelism found in the decorations of Corinthian ceramics once more offers indirect evidence for the identification of the meaning of the representations on the strength of which both may possibly belong to an epoch even more remote than that of the mythical age, a reflex of which may be noted even in the later iconographical developments I have referred to, in which almost all trace of the original meanings and consequently of the original emotions had been lost. On the other hand, a singular documentary proof is offered by the so-called (&lt; Stone of the lions ?, Arslan-tash, at Hailan-Veli in Phry gia (7) It is a basrelief on which two lions rampart, facing one another, are represented, both seen in profile, and between them is an image presumably related to the betilic cult. The composition is almost identical to that of the Gate of the Lions; only at Mycaenae the faces of the lions are seen in the frontal position. In this case the parallelism is more than ever evident. The identity in meaning of the frontal and profile representations is thus once more confirmed. A more thorough examination of this same motif of predatory animals, the study of which has enabled me to come to these conclusions, may lead us to enlarge somewhat the horizon directly connected with the Gorgon. Indeed, the study of a large number of these representations shows that the predatory qua? druped (the lion) may easily be replaced by a bird. In some of the ceramics from Susa and in many goblets from Cyprus belonging to the Mycaenaean age, often ascribed to the so-called Bull Painter of Enkomi, the animal is clearly a bird of prey. One of these is in the British Museum (8). It shows a bull with lowered head about to charge, while a bird attacks it, fastening its beak on the bull's neck and stretching out its claws. The scene is repeated twice on the goblet without any noticeable alteration in the composition. The only changes are in the ornamental marks which fill the threefold divisions of the bull's body. A similar scene is found on two other goblets from Klavdia, now in the British Museum. Lastly, an amphoroid goblet, discovered by the Swedish Mission at Enkomi, is decorated with a design of eight bulls all intent on driving off a flock of birds who have attacked them (9). The interpretation of representations of this kind offered by Karagheorghis might perhaps be valid, but only if the scene of the bull and the birds were an exclusive feature of the Mycaenaean ceramics from Cyprus, and if the Lion by profile, from a Corinthian alabaster.

University bird of prey were not found in the iconography of other civilisations. The Greek archaeologist believes that the artist was probably inspired when composing his design by a scene of common occurrence in the countryside of Cyprus where herds of bulls are often tormen? ted by swarms of insects which are generally eaten by magpies, who thus deliver the herds from their tormentors. But in doing so the birds have to peck the bulls who, annoyed by this, try to drive them off. A comparison with the ceramics from Susa justifies me in seeing in the design I have just described a representation closely resembling the decorations on those ceramics and which must therefore be one of the many predatory motifs. The image referred to by Karagheorghis should be considered as an occasional way of expressing a different motif: it can be explain? ed by the usual mechanism of the theory of archetypal connections. of Amsterdam The possibility of making use sometimes of the lion and sometimes of the bird in repre? senting the predatory motif is matched moreover by the frequency with which some fanciful animal such as a griffin is used to re? present the bird of prey, In the griffin, indeed, the characteristic features of the lion and of the bird are combined, one or other alternately taking the leading part. In the great Etruscan candelabrum of Cor tona (10) the Gorgon's head is surrounded by a circle of designs representing the beasts of prey: on one side a bull is attacked by a f elid (a lion), and on the other by a characteristic winged griffin. A deer (?) attacked by two winged griffins with the characteristic features of a bird and of a lion, is represented on a silver amphora coming from Nikopolis in South Russia (11), part of which is gilded. Lastly, another example of a griffin as a predatory animal is offered by a mosaic of the 4th century B.C. now in the Museum of Corinth (12). The possibility of replacing the lion by a bird in the predatory motif, presupposes a marked affinity ? if not identity ? of mean? ing attached to the two animals in the idea Lion, front view, from a Corinthian amphora.

In addition to this, we have come across a special demoniacal figure belonging to Etruscan mythology, usually portrayed in a way which may give rise to some further considerations on the same subject. The image of a winged demon has been preserved in the tomb of the Ogre at Tarqui nia. It has a large beak which it has thrust into a broad flat face of relatively anthropo? morphic shape. The head is crowned by wiry hair out of which two serpents arise while another serpent is coiled round the arm of the demon. An inscription above the figure gives its name: Tuchulcha (13). The (haracteristcs of the bird as an expres? sion of the daimon are very clearly indicated. The special care taken in depicting them, points to a marked interest in the morbidly terrifying developments of which the image was susceptible. Here again, as in the figures of the Gorgon, the serpent plays a specific part and, taken as a whole and considered from the iconographic standpoint only, the two images seem closely akin. We can at least recognize in them motifs held in common by both and indeed the whole purpose of this study is to prove the existence of certain archetypal motifs which authorise one to speak of a special symbolism, motifs which intermingle, are assimilated and identi? fied in the mythical unconscience of each of the individuals who have created them. Thus what may be described as a rhythmological determination of a biotype common to both is 91</page><page sequence="5">obtained, as far as the original emotions underlying each myth are concerned. And each image ? in this case images of animals ? is found to be linked to another. This gives rise to a reciprocal relation between them, due to the existence of an archetypal connection, and therefore each image may be considered as expressing the meaning and the reason of the other, and viceversa. The connection in question ? to state it in the terms of my theory of the archetypal connections in the origin of myths ? is seen to be the result of a quite special emotional phenomenon. This phenomenon is, indeed, an unconscious one, of which the connection is the conscious manifestation. The passage of this connection from potential to effective as the result of the occurrence of an uncon? scious phenomenon, is conditioned by the special features of the rhythmological envi? ronment. Demoniacal image. S. Petronio, Cappella dei Re Magt. Bologna The characteristics of the bird, which can be noted also in many representations of the Gorgon, are found again in an image akin to it coming from New Zealand. It is one of the usual hei-tiki figures, carved in this case on the facade of a house (14). The body of the monster is intentionally distorted and contrac? ted on conventional lines. The lower part of the head consists of an enormous mouth, strangely resembling that of the corresponding representation of the Gorgon, with protruding tongue; the upper lip so folded as to suggest a beak. Above the mouth are flat, animal? like nostrils, and the diagonally shaped eyes under two very high eyebrows emphasise the demoniacal expression. Two little flakes of mother o'pearl imitate in a masterly way the pupils of the eyes, staring straight ahead. In Head of Gorgon, Amphora of the Gorgon. Museum of Eleusis this image we find the same features as in that of the Gorgon, except for the serpent. From New Zealand comes also a toki hohupu made of jade with an image, no less demoniacal in character, resembling in part the griffins of Etruscan iconography to which we have already referred. It is also designed in conformity with the conventions characteristic of the art of the Maoris. 92</page><page sequence="6">The anthropomorphic features are always present in these demoniacal compositions; indeed, all the theriomorphic features are fused and dramatised in an anthropomophic design in which the corresponding human features are presented with demoniacal defor? mations. Attention must be called to this fact if we wish to have a full understanding of the importance of the Gorgon as shown by two representations of kindred divinities. The first is that of the god Bes, who occupies a special place in the Egyptian Pantheon, and who may have been introduced into it in a very remote age (15). He is represented in the charac? teristic shape of a deformed dwarf, and this leads us to suspect an African origin, a sup? position confirmed by some iconographic features of which we will now speak. His head which, as he is the protector of many objects in common use is frequently represented, comes within the number of de? moniacal images related to that of the Gorgon, displaying more or less leonine features. Here, however, the anthromorphic features prevail, though the face often recalls the frontal view of a lion; the tongue hangs out of the large mouth and the expression is that of a brute beast. The face of the god of the Mahalbis (16), Edschu, resembles that of Bes, though more decisively anthropomorphic. The fact that it is placed beside and above the images of the Universe leads us to suppose that a meaning similar to that assigned to the Gorgon was attributed to it, and this supposition is con? firmed by iconographic resemblances. It would thus seem that all the mythical archetypal motifs (lion, bird, serpent, etc.), reveal reciprocal relations existing between all of them, arising from archetypal connections, which, with the subsequent changes in the meaning given them, were transmitted right down the Middle Ages without losing their essential characteristics. One need only observe the leonine patterns woven into some materials dating back to the early Middle Ages, the demoniacal motifs dear to Gothic iconography, etc., to confirm this. But along with these shapes we always find the human image (17) which indeed is frequently the predominant feature, for all the theromorphic features are modified to bring them within its scope. The representation of the divinity with its universal attributes is confined within the limits of an image which is generically that of a human being. Hei tiki, of Uriwera Tribe, New Zealand. Pigorini Museum, Rome This is a fact of special importance for the history of religions, as it throws light on the reciprocal relations existing between the mean? ings attributed to the images of animals and to the representations of the human figure, as conceived in most of the rhythmological environments.
