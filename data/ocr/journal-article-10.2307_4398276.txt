<plain_text><page sequence="1">PERSPECTIVES Aeligion and larxism Some Theoretical Problems Shashi Joshi We can locate a powerful spiritual source for Marxism which produced as much fervour to 'save' humanity as any other religion. It also produced the orthodoxy and the will to power, the claims to omnipotence and the intolerance of historically degenerated and ossified religious orders. MARXISM AS RELIGION THERE abounds a false impression that tne characterisation of Marxism as a religion is made primarily by non-Marxists or critics of Marxism.' IDisappointed and disillusion- ed members of Marxist parties and move- ments, and 'enlightened' post-Marxists have more often emphasised the 'strong- similarity' thesis. More, Marxists who espouse sympathy for religious values and movements have revealed a greater religious temper than non-Marxists like Max Weber, who asserted that he was 'religiously tone deaf: In fact, Marxianity, that is, Marxist theory turned religion, provides ample illustrations from the writings of Marxists themselves. The similarities between Christianity and Marxism/communism in the eschatological field, in the composition and mentality of early Christian and communist groups, their relations with society as a whole. and the emergence of ideological conflict are well recorded. Several quotations from Engels show 'remarkable points of contact' between them.2 More. some prominent Christians, both theologians and representative laymen such as Reinhold Niebuhr, Nicholas Berdyaev and Jaques Maritain endorse the similarities between institutions and con- cepts of early communism and early Chris- tianity. The parallels are too striking to be ignored. An early example of self-professed Marxist writing runs like this: "Marx was a man of imagination and ...a man of ethical passion... He called to mer., like the great prophet before him, 'Repent ye, for the Kingdom of Gbd is at hand!' That the indi- vidual man should make the thing of terror a thing of joy by anticipating the revolution in his own heart and mind was the whole gospel of Jesus. It is the whole gospel of Marx!'3 The British Marxist, John Lewis, mounted his contribution in the style of a sermon: "The apocalyptic crisis has descended upon our age, not prematurely as in the time of Jesus, but in the fullness of time. Opportunity, as it confronts us, is also the final sifting of chaff from the wheat, the day of judgment. The Church may try, but it cannot succeed in crucifying the Christ. The new Christ is an insurgent proletariat, the uprisen people of god, and the Church which fails to do Him reverence must be cast forth into the outer darkness. The Day of the Lord is at hand!'4 The religious senti- ment and fervour is unmistakable. The Marxist insistence that Marxism should be regarded as a theory 'primarily concerned with political action' rather than a philosophical system or an economic analysis and programme as Robin Blackburn maintains is, precisely, the root of the religiosity of Marxist beliefs.5 Because, political action demands 'faith' a faith which can be impervious to the cracks and chinks in 'reason. For, chinks in reason are impermissible in a theory that seeks to pre- sent itself as the epitome of 'historical reason' and bases its calls to political action on the logical inevitability of historical 'laws'. 'Faith' is, naturally, very important when esoteric elements such as 'Diamat' (i e, dialectical materialism) are clearly seen by Marxist intellectuals as difficult for all to follows. For example, Tlotsky wrote in 1939: "Ib demand that every party member occupy himself with the philosophy of dialectics naturally would be pedantry!'6 Obviously, only the 'vanguard of the vanguard' could possibly master the theory. Thus, the relationship between the leaders and the led in the communist party was not so different from the relationship between the priests and the laity in any Christian church. Commenting on this phenomenon, S F Kissin writes: "To the average practising Christian, the concept of the holy spirit is presumably exactly as much of a mystery as the interpenetration (or identity and unity) of opposites must be for the average member of any communist party"7 Thus, the necessary postulate of 'faith' the hallmark of a believer. The call to political action premised on faith inspired long ago the common sense observation, "if understanding were more general we should not have the silly quarrel between theists who take god on faith and atheists who deny god on faith..!"8 It also led Raymond Aron to point out the false ir- religiosity of the Marxist who throws out god and church but sees the October revolu- tion as marking the entry into the kingdom of god, with the class struggle and the con- flict between nations constituting sacred history.9 The very question posed by Marxism, "Does history evolve in a defined direction that promises ultimate equalisation and universal justice?", is descended from the theological tradition. And, by answering the question with an affirmative it grants to 'history' the role of god. As Kolakowski puts it: "History stole onto the throne of Jehovah, who had been deposed by violence'."1 Thus, Marxism established the domain of historical eschatology and took over the burden of god, holding out to the unfortunate the vision of a happy ending in which their torment and efforts would be rewarded. The millennium of worldwide abundance, peace, brotherhood and pros- perity is inevitable (because it is projected as almost in tune 'with the necessity of a natural process') and on this 'faith' rests the raison d'etre of the struggle for socialism. It is this feature of Marxism which Kolakowski captured in his famous im- aginary dialogue between the Clerk and the Anti-Clerk: "I refuse to support any form of historical existence on the basis of its inevitability-for which I see no evidence at this time.. Since l do not share your faith, as optimistic as it is unsubstantiated, regar- ding the predictability of things to come, I never know what effects our present actions will have in the future.'" The etiology of Marxianity is sharply trac- ed to the functioning of Marxism as a theodicy in modern form. Theodicy, "a method of transforming facts into values... is without doubt a legacy from magical thinking, which assumes a belief in the sanc- tifying or damning power of certain events, unrelated to their empirical characteristics but derived from their invisible at- tributes."2 Theodicy, in its modern form as Marxism becomes an intellectual construct of the world that makes the evil we know or experience in the world reveal its 'sense' and value interwoven in the wise plans of history. By substituting the absolute in god with the absolute in the historical process, secular historiosophy in Marxism simply assumes the task of theology in a new form. Kolakowski calls this the Calvinist solution. The nostalgia for revelation lives on in the heart of philosophy and it inherits from theology the need for discovering an 'ultimate law' or the 'eternal axiom' of reali- ty which discloses the unity of the universe and to which all our knowledge can in some way be reduced. The spirit is common and shared: between the 'great heavenly justice' of religion and the 'great historical justice' of Marxism. Many have self-confessedly taken to Marxism because of its messianic religious quality. Ernst Bloch, for example, believed that religion has a permanent indestructible root which had to be preserved in futuristic Marxism. Religion, therefore, was not to be treated as a mere collection of superstitions arising from ignorance or the search of op- pressed peoples for illusory consolation. For Bloch, Marxism was, thus an all-embracing utopia; it would lead to the supreme good or totem; it was an act of hope, moving towards the ultimum or paradise. Bloch's ex- tended account of ancient Egyptian, Greek, Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu and Christian ideas Economic and Political Weekly November 9, 1991 2563</page><page sequence="2">on immortlity (Das PY-inzip Hojer:x ) .:on- cluded that howsoever pure these f;iitasiies were a maiifestation of the utopian will andc of human dignity. Their role in the ,eal world, therefore, as opposed to Lantasy, was to be realised by Marxism, which Ywould telp the world to attain divine perfcion. f4arxist Bloch perhaps came the closest to revealing the strong religious impulse and milenarian dreams to which Marxism was playing god. In fact, when Marxists are not the ex- ponents of the crudest arguments of materialism, their main dialogue and inter- face is with religion. Their religious bent of mind, impassioned desire to discover an ideal greater and higher than the sound and fury of everyday life is manifest in so mucd of Marxist writing. An ifluminating pa.sage from Mike Gold-introduced s-s "the best known literary communist in the Uttited States" reveals this fully: "I'he sound and fury of the city night! The elmat.ed roare-d lke an aroused monster overhead; the pznople stirred and sifted in black m.asses on the sidewalks; pedlars barked, pivtnos janglk'-A, light flowed in golden sheets frorm galaudy store windows; three young girls fled with locked arms down the street, laughinp, 0n,M screarming with joy as three lads pjursued them. Chatter, gabble, laughter, hanerdse;s, fluidity, on and on the hosts poured, as if this were all of life, raising their complcxa,?nd titanic anthem of nothingness to the sky!" y3 The apprehensions of a meaningless lif, the anxieties of purposeless activity, the loneliness of the individual in a sc,ethiinw mass of humanity ("black masses c'a the sidewalk"): in sum, the miortal fear of con- cluding that "chatter, gabble, laughter',3 etc "were all of life!--all of which amiiounted t.o "an anthem of nothingness!" The key %ord is "nothingness'"-the Sartrean monste-r of 'nothingness' and the ordeal of investing it with meaning. The existential dilemnmas of the mind and spirit, of 'essence andj 'existence' are the common fount of a 'religious' inspiration for both-the MWarxists and men of god. However, the desire to see this anxiety assuaged which was sublimated and philosophically nurtured by faith in god was fed by materialism with the fuel of im- patience Belief in the capacity of matter to act and triumph over antagonistic/conflic- ting sprits was the rationale of the materialist against the spiritual. And if "there was no god of justice, for there was n1o justice' in the world then man must play the hand himself and mete justice to the "famished, the ground down, the helpless and thte trusting"4 In fact, the same terrms described the con- stituency sought and nurtured by the religious and the men of god as for the sen- sitive Marxist-the 'children' of society who need the care and protection of the divinie, whether the heavenly divine or the morta and human divine! For "god was wherever men died for an ideal. He stirred men to deeds that were super-human... he gave weak women a power that was above empim- Yes, god was in the world!

Thie sheattering maaterialist interpretation of religion is only .ccomplished by an evangelical interpretattion of naterialism. All maijor religious traditiorns are totalis- ineg in character, claiming all of' a follower's titfe, so that religion is constitutive of socie- ty. Likewise, tie key concept of 'totalisation' is encountered in the writings of major Marxist theoreticians fromii Lukac's to Habermas. "fotalisation' is also the lie motif of Sartres Critique (e. la-RPoion Dialectique. Marxism thus bears thie imprint of a relemptive ideology in its claimi to being the true bearer of morad attributes. However, the Marxist faith in redemptioni produces not religious despair and compassion for the real world of evil and injustice but a fanatic hatred against it. It cauises the faithful to "4engage not with the real world of political negotiation and compromiise, but with the 'deep' and illusory world of uncoroprormis- ing force, in which light and (lark struggle for roetaphysical ascendancy that can be achieved by no nerely hiuman willE"19 Con- sequently, the need for 'historical necessity an-d itevitability'.

If Marx was corret in saying that the alienated beings needs are satisfied by relion or that religion is sought by human beings for their satisfaction then why should alienated being's not sek in Marism the satisfaction of precisely those needs which religion traditionally satisfied? For een when a person accepts the intelectual arguments and prescriptions of Marxism his alienation propels him towards a 'faith' ac- cording to Marx's analysis itself. There have been proselytising zealots in every religion. So, why should Marxism be excluded from this procss? The great dif- ference however is that secularising in- fluences removed orgaised, centralised and coecive power from the haids of traditional rligions. Perhaps, they will do the same for a modern religion such as Marxism. Perhaps, the politics of consensual miinimunis will finally prevail as the only sane solution to existence aid result in coni- stitutiona, democratic, negotiated com- promises in all societies as well as in the world which would, hopefully, be a surer even if a slower, more gradual process to at- tain human ends. The areas of Christendom-where faith and reason battled and compromised-are precisely the areas where the consensus solu- tion was gradually posited by democracy, in which socio-political arrangement the two could co-exist whether in a state of tension or equilibrium. The countries dominated by Islam, the other great world religion, on the other hand have by and large not yet pro- duced democratic political outcomes. India, where Hinduism the 'religion' of its majority has acquired the reputation of being all- absorbent and capable of sucking in diverse religious beliefs and dissenting sects, that is, being a consensus seeking belief system, is the only non-Christian area where democracy survives. The example of the USSR-part of Christendom-where democracy was marginalised by Marxism actuafly proves the rule and not the exception. For without a dexmnocratic framework in which the church could occupy its own place, the Russian rul- ing state and ideology had to function as an alternative theology to the old established traditional one. In that sense, the Russian state and society remained a theology dominated one where, all authority, certitude and laws governing ones being were reposed in the organised party and state if not in the church and the clergy. And if democracy arrives in the USSR an important perhaps crucial and pivotal role will be played by religion and the church in terms of its ideological and ethico-moral influgnce over the people. Both Marxism and religion have experi- enced for sometime a crisis of varying pro- portions and sections from within the fold have sought to overcome it and restore what they perceive as its original pristine purity by a return to the sources and scriptural reinterpretation. This has led to thle emer- gence of the twin phenomenBa of humanist:ic socialism on the one hand arid liberation 2564 Economnic and Political Weekly November 9, 1991</page><page sequence="3">theology on the other. The underlying stress of liberation theology according to a Delhi based Jesuit thwlogian, is that religion can no longer be considered a private affair. It is, or shotld be, public, political, concemed less with interpteting the world than changing it.20 Its main point of departure is to reject what is seen as the academic, transcendental nat:ure of tradi- tional theology which does not meet effec- tively the challenges of today's socio- economic political and cultural realities. The answer it provides for redeeming this 'failure is to proclaim the core of the biblical message: freedom and lIberation. In Aifredo Fierros' words, 'faith thus jumps into praxis'2 This position is interpreted as hav- ing the support and blessings of Pope John Paul II who adivsed the church in Brazil: "Apply your power, be it political, economic or cultural, to the service.., of the pooe,22 While on his visit to India in 1986 the Pope pointedly directed the Indian Christian church not be a 'spectator' but a 'sharer' and 'shaper' of a struggling society. Thus, liberation theology is chiefly a Latin American and third worldist phenomenon- an area where the raison d'etre of Marxism as a force promising liberation and prosperi- ty cuts into the following of the church. Here the majority of the poor and oppressed are susceptible to millenarian promises and visions to be realised in this world. As a result, a section of theologians and clergymer responded with a fusion of religious and socialist ideas. This trend emerged chiefly from the involvement of religious believers in social and liberation struggles and left- wing elements formed separate groups within religious organisations, usually in- spired by radical interpretations of religion. The impact of Marxism produced a crisis for existing religious orders.23 In the western world, mainly western Europe and to an extent America, a few critical religious groups also emerged, such as, 'Critical Christians', 'Marxist Christians' and 'Christian Socialists'. In the United States a protestant black theologian ex- pounded A Black Theology of Liberation24 addressing himself to racial oppression, working class women, the culturAlly rejected and socially marginalised, that is, those sec- tions for whom social and cultural depriva- tion was more crucial than any lack of economic benefits and who had been lumped into economic classes by the Marxists. Nevertheless, the industrial, technological revolutions in the western world and an enlarging sphere of democracy rendered the ever expanding middle strata and workers not only immune to but critical of Marxist prognoses on capitalism and defensive Marxist apologia of actually existing socialist societies. Thus, in the west, Marx- ism has found itself in acute crisis. In fact, the inability of Marxism to face the moral vacuum and crisis of values in an acutely in- secure and amoral world lends strength to religion's critique of Marxism. Cconsequent- ty, while in the poorer areas of the world the church and religion has launched a cam- paign to reconquer or expand its influence via liberation theology, in the wealthier zones apocalyptic Marxism has been retreat- ing fromii its ecolonoistic solutions to the ethico-moral-cultural dilemmas of life. This retreat is lucidly reveaed in the Soviet Union of late, -and, we take this up in thte nxt section. The efforts of 'progressive left theology' thus, have been to synthesise MaIxsm and Chlristianity or at the leatst 'all,' the two In 'project liberation'. Much hlberatiLn th..ology has found common ground witth its unpro- blematic movemeat from biblcal nmetapior to political category and back again.25 It has also led to the development of a 'strong compatibility' thesis emphasising their con- mon goals.6 : lowever, the basic theoretical antagonism of Marxism towards religion survives despite pragmatic alliances with religious groups. (This antagonism emerges more filly in our discussion of Marxism and humanism in section IV.) The Marxist Terry Eagleton declared categorically: "MMarxism and Christianity are not synchronous discourses?,27 And Fraincis Barker fintds "something radicaltly pro- blematical about the idea of a science debating with w hat is pot?entially its object as if it were an epistemologca.l cquax?"2i'3 T his position can be traced back to Marx- Engel's explicit rejection even of politically radical Christia2nity. En gels sawi the struggle betw'een Dither and the neo-Ainabaptist leader Thiomas Munzer as essentially poli- tical class strug'gles which the protagonists had misread as theolog..ical strug ges. 29 Marx anid Enigels "put religion on trial before a rather Krfikaesque tribunal: insofar as religionr is sincerely religion, it is a set of abstract platitudes, at best useless, at worst harmful to the advaancernent of humanity; inso'ar as it says anything abo ut the social and political reality of its time. it has ceas- ed to be religion"'30 Even the advocate ot 'stronig compatibili- ty' between Marxism and Christianity is compelled to conclude that the Christiani cannot "accqpt, and the Marxist is foolish to imply, that the Christian comimitment to an immaterialist ontology is a private matter separable.. from the commitmnenit to a histo- rical, empirical institution... with self- defined material commitrments" 3' Likewise, no Marxist can theoretically accept that his Marxism is ontological without a self- defined commitment to the institution of the party and the state to which he aspires. The idea of a 'private Christianity' is as absurd as is the idea of a 'private Marxism'. In the religious world, humanism was associated with groups anid sects who sought to rationalise and simplify Christiarnity and substituted moral imperatives applicable to all humankind for theological dogmas.32 Within the fold of Marxism there also emerged dissenting groups seeking to substi- tute universal humanistic concerns and rela- tions for the theological dogmas of Mairx- ism. Lucien GolIdmann, an important Marx- ist thinker described the twentieth century world as one in which bureaucracy, authori- tarian organisation and hierarchiical st ruc- ture had become almost universal charac- teristics.33' These features he saw as comx- mon between th1e organised and inlstitu- tioxnalised religionls of the world--in3cluding existing Marxism-anXd the political struc- tures of bmth conmuoi-ist and capitalist so-ieties. The dif erence between the coun- tries of .dvanced industrialisation in the vest and thie Soviet and the east European cou-niel.0s was that the former began with trnited de'inoeracy whlich slowly filtered dcl.cn to the mnses while the peoples of the la!.tr ountries were denied this as their reginn es in their effort to "catch-up" econor .ically and te chnologically were more brhtally authoritarian. It 'as in this context that Goldmann bluntly posed the problem of power versus hi m-anism. In this scenario, he wrote, socialist, humanist, Christian and critical and cultural hopes were together being marginalised and took on the aspect cf simriple survivals from the past. The juxta- position of 'states' and 'Bureaucracies' to all ideologies centred around humanity and humaniism suggested a sharp confrontation between power and hlumanism. Thus the meeting gretnd for Christianity/Religion and Derocratic/Hiumane Socialism was ap- proacled and Goldmann amongst others hoped their meeting would transform the mo-dern world in the late sixties and seven- tieCs. 'Thle Marxist appreciation of liberation th 'ology and ti Marxist-Christian dialogues in -oland, etc, energed as new cultural trends. The humanism of the religious belic-ver and the humanism of the subscriber L. sociadsT Iideals appeared to meet as allies. lH wever, the self-confessed hard core 'inat- ;ist M arxist' opposed to the 'humanist MI-xist' refuses to accept this overlap on the giourtd that scientific socialists and huma- mtists (variously labelled as 'abstract indivi- dualists' ox 'bourgeois- democratic ideolo- gists') vProceed from different premises, ad- voate incompatible methods of action, and rely upon different social forces'.4 Con- cretely aid practically, what the 'materialist M1arxist' objected to in 'Marxist humanism' was the latter's repudiation of a class basis or affiliation 'in humanist concerns, its e-spousal of peace by negotiation among na- tions and the reconciliation of classes. These humanist positions the 'materialist Marxist' dismnisses contemiptuously as "a secular ver- si-n of the universal embrace of Christian botherhood't35 The Marxist humanists who go to the 'early Marx' and discover his humanismn and Feuerbachian philosophical moorings are castigated in no uncertain terms: "Just as the Protestant reformers went back to the original gospels to find an un- corruipted Christianity, so these socialist reformers go back to the first writings of the immature Marx for the unpolluted sources of socialism"36 The humanists in Russia from Pasternak to Solzhenitsyn, were marginalised by the power-wielders and sought in religion the ethico-moral values which had been oblite- rate-d by the logistics of the conflict-struggle- revolution-power equation. The stiff opposi- tion to the label of humanism by Maoists on the one hand and by the Althusserian Marxists on the other unveils the core of the problemr, for humnanists are seen as salvaging theZ values of religion through humanism.

A contemporary postscript could be add- ed from the critique by the Indian Com- munists of Gorbachev's efforts today. The Indian communists reject Gorbachev's revi- sionist notions of "an intierdependent and integral world" unified because of its com- mon concern for "the problem of human survival"; the concept of "indepth modifica- tion of class struggles"; and the emphasis on "top priority for universal human values". The Indian communists conclude that these positions are "directly contradic- tory to accepted understanding in the com- munist movement" and "a damper on the world revolutionary movement".7 SOVIET MARXISM AND RELIGION Leon Trotsky often referred to the Bol- sheviks as 'Jacobins' extracting the secular character of Jacobinism. But the Jacobins cannot be simply written off as 'secular' and 'rational'. The French revolutionaries at- tempts at de-Christianisation and the intro- duction of secular beliefs failed even as the old style church failed to retain its influence. The Marxism that prevailed in post- revolutionary Russia was certainly not secular: the formula was theological. The apparent religious connection vanished but not "its place in the discourse which claims to decide about 'everything. 'Souls have been abolished' announced zealous activists at work in Russia's provinces in 1924, just as they might have said that bread was being rationed, or sugar subjected to restrictions:'38 The Christianisation of Russia had been very important for its history because the new religion had brought a fundamentally new way of perceiving the world, the power of the state, the organisation of society, rela- tions between peoples and their interpreta- tions of morality.39 Marxism sought, literal- ly, to replace these perceptions at each level with its own. Adam Ulam's biographical account of Lenin and the Bolsheviks describes how Marxism for them was not only a political creed but a religion and a way of life. Cen- tred in their emotional world was Marxism's "stern moral judgment and doom pronounc- ed upon the rich and powerful of this world".'4 This was emotionally all the more satisfying for the doom could not be avoid- ed or softened as by the propitiation of the all too human gods of the old religions. For the gods of 'historical reason' and 'inevita- bility' cannot be propitiated. As Eugene Kamenka remarks 'history' replaced 'god' when the CPSU seized power "in the name of a new metaphysical sovereign: history itself"'4 This was, of course, the logical out- come of Marx's proclamation of an ultimate goal supported by history. Today, there is a retreat from occupation of the house of god and declarations by Soviet leaders and social scientists about the importance of spiritual values and dignity of man which is greater than barriers of class and political considerations. However, till very recently, despite appreciation of libera- tion theology and dissenting groups in the churches the theoretical condemnation of religious beliefs by Soviet Marxists was neither modified nor mediated. The resis- tance of religious organisations to anti- popular policies in various parts of the world compelled the Soviet Marxists to recognise religion as an ideology which can represent the masses but at the theoretical level they continued to maintain that religion (because it was illusory and an expression of false consciousness) was an obstacle in the path of genuine emancipation. The voice and actions of various religious leaders such as Bishop Romero, the General Vicar of San Salvador, followers of the New Mexican Catholic Church, the National Conference of Brazilian Bishops, and the formulations of the International Theological Seminar representing Latin American, Asian and African countries held in Sao Paulo in 1980 revealed the potential of such forces to be hegemonised by communists and other left groups. The openness and sympathetic attitude of many believers towards Marxist groups lent credibility to such a perspective. The 'rebels clad in cassock' were especially glorified because they were ready to accept the Marxist premise of "employing armed means of transforming society".42 Precisely because religion was viewed not as a real historical, social and moral force the movements it inspired were attractive to the project of Marxist hegemony. And precisely because the falseness of this pro- ject and its logic were transparent to those post-Marxists who had transcended the dogmas and given truths of their Marxist past they became the main targets of attack of Soviet Marxists. Characterised as "revi- sionists who have abandoned Marxism" men such as Ernst Bloch, Roger Garaudy, Leszek Kolakowski and Ernst Fischer were anathema for they rejected crude materialism and ad- vocated "a new interpretation of the mean- ing of religion" as a humanistic and revolu- tionary system of beliefs and values. Their crime was to "identify religion and the faith with the entire humanistic potential built up by mankind in the course of its history".43 This was because, theoretically, "dialectical materialism cannot be reconciled to the irrational world outlook of religion-the source of a distorted reflection of the world"44 Nevertheless, the repositories and pur- veyo?s of what was theoretically 'a false and distorted reflection', the dissenting, opposi- tional religious groups and believers themselves were pragmatically appropriated as 'allies'. Clearly, their abhorrence of war, injustice and inequality seemed amenable to being eventually hegemonised by Marxist argument. L'Humanite, the organ of the Communist Party of France, reported trium- phantly that 58 per cent of believers in France considered it possible to be both a Communist and a Catholic and "were in- creasingly realising that communists are the staunchest champions of social justice".45 The enemies of Marxism were, mainly, those leftists-the black sheep who had left or been thrown out of the fold-who insisted that only by abandoning dialectical materia- lism would communists be sincere in their co-operation with the religious believers. However; as late as last year, a So)viet publication declared categorically that "even in its updated form" (i e, radical commit- ment) "religion remains a fallacious and ir- rational world outlook and continues to fulfil its old ideological social function...of restricting the social vigour of its followers and obstructing their harmonious develop- ment"46 Consequently, if Marxism's goal is to release the social vigour of people and achieve their harmonious development ac- cording to its own conceptions, then the 'obstacle of religion' cannot but generate an inherent antagonism with Marxism. Moreover, the antagonism refuses to be confined to ideological goals and objectives but must enter the methods and means by which Marxism seeks to combat religious ideology. Appreciating the record of reli- gious organisations in advocating detente and peace among peoples and opposing the arms race in recent years, the Catholic Church's pronouncements beginning with the pontificate of Pope John XXIII cannot be ignored by Soviet Marxists. Pope Patl VI's and Pope John II's47 continuous ex- pressions of dismay and grave concern over the world situation, however, continue to be ultimately unacceptable to Marxist discourse because of their "pacifist" nature. All at- tempts by Soviet Marxists to meet the churcKh or believers halfway get soured by the ques- tion of ends and means. For the religious appeal based on "moral weapons" and the slogan that "peace can only be attained through peace' are from the Marxist stand- point "shirking the issue'.48 The Marxists cannot see the truth and deep seated conviction of the church and religion that class hatred and violent methods are fundamentally anti-Christian and anti- religious. Therefore they accuse religion in general and the Vatican in particular of "allegiance to conservative forces" and trying to "constrain the emancipation theology".49 In 1980, Jean Ellenstein the French com- munist was attacked by Soviet Marxists for saying that Marx's ideas on religion were- valid only for the Germany of the 1840s and arguing that scientific and social progress does not reduce the need for the trans- cendental.50 Now, in 1988, there appears to be a slow but inevitable acceptance of the reality of the human condition and an aban- donment of the crude formulations of the past: "There is no reason to hope that scien- tific technological and cultural progress will suffice to eliminate religious beliefs'51 A new awareness of the psychological, ethical, moral and aesthetic needs of human beings is being emphasised. The termn "spiritual and emotional needs of individuals" is no longer taboo. Ceremony and tradition, the casualties of dialectical materialist thinking are forcing themselves upon Marxist consciousness. Some sort of retreat from earlier Soviet positions, which is a great advance from the poinit of view of humanity and democracy, is signified by Soviet Marxists when they draw the conclusion that: "Marxcists mulst respect the pacifist activity of all people, no matter what motivates them, and despite serious differences in views. Hence the need 2566 Econiomic arid lol'tical Weekly November 9, 1991</page><page sequence="5">to expand co-operation between people holding different political, philosophical and religious views.'52 This development suggests a retreat in the face of an ethical concept recognising the existence of standards of-morality common to the human race and stressing their impor- tance for modern politics and social life. G Batygin, an editor of the journal Socio- logical Studies of the USSR Academy of Sciences, writes: "The new political thinking rests on the indisputable priority of general human values over class, national and other local interests. At the same time the concept (perestroika) advocates the doctrine of non- violence as an ethic and principle of rela- tionships between human beings!'53 S Serebryany asserts that "perestroika has been conceived as a non-violent revolution. And in this sense it is an almost unprece- dented undertaking in our history' He goes on to acknowledge that violence is impotent when the task is to create new spiritual values and that the need today is for freedom from violence. And in this context he hails M K Gandhi, the leader of the Indian national movement against colonial rule for pro- claiming non-violence as an universal ideal for humanity.54 The pacifism of religious organisations, the churches and the Vatican and the non- violence principle can thus no longer be dubbed 'anti-Marxist' and 'anti-genuine humanism' which they were earlier. In fact, till 1987, the message of peace and non- violence was castigated as a "doctrine of social pacification which opposes drastic change and in the long run, supports historically doomed forces, thus obstructing social progress".55 Today a new language, and hopefully it will endure, is manifest: "The principal criterion of the humanistic concept of justice lies in the choice of methods of exercising it... social responsibili- ty and true political culture can only be founded on strict observance of law and respect for human rights, including the right to have one's own opinion:'56 Clearly, a plurality of opinions and ideas-the rationale of democracy-is the crucial element in ensuring that these prin- ciples being newly accepted and advocated will survive and come to terms with religion. To what extent and how far a sympathetic and genuine meeting of Marxists with the religious temper of human beings will ac- tually be achieved in the Soviet Union will depend upon how far a process of democrati- sation is initiated and defended in the futue Only that will allow a graceful abandonment of questionable 'Marxist truths' inherited from the past. Concretely, the positive beginning has been made: "summoning a rousing crescen- do, the male choir filled the soaring vaults of St Vladimir's Cathedral in Kiev with the special hymn of the Russian Orthodox millennium: 'Sacred Rus, safeguard the Or- thodox faith, for in it is your affirmation!"57 Transmitted by loudspeakers to the crowds on Taras Shevchenko Boulevard, it marked MQikhail Gorbachev's proclamation of a new degree of tolerance for the church opening another front in his campaign to liberalise Soviet society and gaining the support of an institution that claims the allegiance of 50 million Soviets. In allowing the church at last a sanction- ed place in Soviet life Gorbachev has in ef- fect conceded the inability of the atheist state after 70 years to replace the spiritual grip of religion on the narod. This more than anything reveals the force of a historical truth: driving an idea underground in- variably fails to crush it. 'RADICAL PERSONALISM' The inconclusive dialogue between religion and Marxism as well as the ex- periences of many whose moral-humane commitments had been bruised by Marxism and "really existing socialism" or by "religion organised as a church" showed that ideology itself is power. It is utilised and acts as organisational power, hierarchical power, cultural-social power, class and group power-in effect political power even when it is not a state power ruling over society. Ideology, whether of religion or Marxism, acquires the substance of 'power' by its domination over people's minds and hearts and is propelled towards proselytisation and an organisational church form unless it con- sciously divests the 'idea' of its 'logy. In other words, unless it diverts itself of its determinism, its millenarial promise, the teleology of its 'Idea' and the unflinching loyalty and faith it demands for that one idea. It is only a recognition and acceptance, in complete humility, of the multiplicity of ideas, beliefs and human-centred cultural and moral aspirations that has a potential and hope for reflectihg humanity in all its complexity without creating the logic of monstrous power and 'one godhead' Thus we return to the concept of humanism. The word humane is inherently to do with human beings and their power over them- selves and one another. In personalised, indi- vidual form it is the stuff of psychoanalytic exploration. However, human power in its collectivity is as multiple as human beings are unique individually or collectively in their societal-cultural settings. It is therefore not the power of an idea or ideas that leads to monstrous power but 'ideas stiffened into an ideology' which is/has been/can be historically structured and imposed by a sec- tion of humans over other humans. Con- trary to this, human power must be recognis- ed as a relationship, for good or evil, which can flow towards good or evil ends con- tingent upon the ends and means of human beings themselves. In other words, human power can move towards the humane if enough people enter into a relationship of commitment to those human ends which eschew and reject the means that have led to the creation of monstrous power in history. The very first step towards such a humanistic movement is to reject all teleologies, determinisms, millenniums simultaneously with violence and ethico- cultural immorality. This concretisation of the problem of power versus humanism to the question of ends and means posed as a choice before humanity is what M K Gandhi made the centrality of his encounter with the world. He raised the means of non-violence to a principle of universal morality for all human ends. Significantly, and not surprisingly, the first attempt to conduct a Christian-Marxist dialogue in Poland in the late seventies stumbled on this problematic of Gandhi's. A problematic labelled as 'Radical Persona- lism' by the Polish Marxists. The Polish Marxists have been the pioneers in recognising that "theoretically and practically, Christianity may be recognised as a form of humanism...and a humanistic philosophy also from the stand- point of anthropocentric Marxism" and hoping for "purely humane relations bet- ween believers and non-believers".58 However, on the Gandhian problematic there was a reiteration of old Marxist premises, howsoever modified, for example in the ,change bewen Andezej G=zegorzyk and Janusz Kuczynski. The former postu- lated a categorical imperative: "we have two ways open before us..either we recognise each human individual as an absolute value, or we recognise the principle of arithmetic summing up of the values of individuals. This dilemma seems to lead to the afore sket- ched dilemma: Gandhi-Machiavelli:'59 The Gandhian way being the eschewal of all violence-in any form and at any time-in human relations. In answer, Janusz Kuczynski maintained that the stand which rejects all violence (i e, the Gandhian stand) was that of "radical personalism" whereas, in his view only Marxism could offer the solution to pro- blems of choice and violence in the world. In other words, he went back to the Marxist notion of "violence must be assessed from the historical and class point of view" though conceding to Andrezej Grazegor- zyk's notion of 'universal morality' without admitting the polarity built into the two no- tions.60 Who is to decide and how what is historical and class justice? And whether it is "progressive" or "immoral"? What is the term "immoral" if not integral to the con- cept of a univesal morality? And so on. The complete opposition between the concepts of 'universal morality' and 'historic necessity of violence must be confronted honestly. Given the violence of past historical societies the Marxist reading of societal development and the Marxist solution of a violent overthrow of past and present systems appeared, briefly, in the history of the world to present one kind of solution to some minds. However, the truth of human existence is that systems can seek to replace each other but cannot hope to replace religion. For world religions, regardless of aberrations in practice or degeneration into orthodoxies contradicting their own precepts embody the principle of 'unity of human- kind and non-violence'. It is this 'non- violence principle', in the anthropological and anthropomorphic sense, which demands and propels a reinsertion of religion into the lives of men and women in all systems, socialist and capitalist, in modern times. The 'revitalisation' phenomenon, whether it incorporates religious beliefs or only religiously revives its secular, cultural iden- tities, is manifest today in the mushrooming ethico-moral humanist groups, and the emergence of 'cultural Marxism' which are Economic and Political Weekly November 9, 1991 2567</page><page sequence="6">in my view reinsertions and reassertions of religion in today's world. This permanence of religion in new ways and new forms is a hallmark of the failure of reason to establish itself as a pure form' without acknowledging the permanent exis- tence of faith and pretending that it, itself, can survive without faith. Religious faith in god or secular faith in reason-eitherways the lynchpin is faith. More significantly, the generalised impulse and urge of humanity to live a peaceful, non-violent life has been asserted and proclaimed as the principle of unifying humanity by religion alone. Con- sequently, it is the religious personality which appears with fervour and desperation in the streets of contemporary life, chanting its slogans for peace, against destruction; in movements for nuclear disarmament, for women's and children's rights; for the very survival of human life in movements for the defence of the ecology and environment. The CND and the Greens are no less reli- gious for being dressed in the uniform of reason-for they assert the life affirming principle of non-violence while reason has argued/can argue/may go on arguing in the voice of logic and anti-faith for the necessi- ty of mutual violent deterrents if not confrontations. Let me emphasise that the brief influence of Marxism as an ideology over many in the past owed largely to the Marxist denuncia- tion of imperialist and capitalist violence and wars and holding out the promise of an end to all violence and wars in socialism. This influence could not have endured precisely because the faith/reason dichotomy was replicated by Marxism in the ends and means antagonism. Its refusal to face the ethics and morality of posing violent means for non-violent ends could only mean that it could not eliminate faith by posing as pure reason. It could only close its doors till such titne as humanity's urge to peaceful, non- violent existence breaks them down. To put it another way, the glorious ends promised by Marxism through violent means did not take cognisance of, in fact, militated against a supreme human need for a non- violent and peaceful existence. Thus socia- lism wherever attempted could not transform life but only the system. The human need to destroy structures of violence could not be accomplished by violent means. This is the space religion occupies again and again. Trhe most recent example of the method of peaceful protest embodying the non- violence principle for struggle within society is provided interestingly by the Soviet Union. Irina Ratushinskaya struggled three long years against mindless cruelty in a Soviet political prison by launching a campaign of 'holy disobedience'. Its basic premise was to abide by lawfulness even when the official upholders of the law stoop to his, and to maintain ones dignity in the face of all at- tempts to destroy it. These were the basis premises of Gandhi's conduct of civil disobedience in India. Irina, together with a small group of women refused to be provoked by shouting and swearing officials; refused to stand when they entered the room as they refused to recog4ise their authority; none of the women wore the identity tags given to them nor did anything to help maintain the camp as prisoners are expected to do. On the other hand they performed their 'work' task assigned to them in prison (glovemaking)- properly and without fail When vindictive officials ruined their por- ridge with lashings of salt the women col- lectively sent all their food back to the kit- chens until the authorities became frightened that they would die of hunger. When a desperately sick woman prisoner was denied hospital treatment all the women refused to work until the prison authorities gave way. Longed for meetings with loved ones were forgone to make the necessary protest. Irina is a Christian and writes that her faith makes her feel responsible for what she calls the "dragon's teeth" sown by her society.60 Notes I Tresor Ling, Katl Marv canid Religioni, Macmillan, 1980. 2 S F Kissin, Farewell to Resolulion, Wieden- field and Nicolson, London, 1978. 3 J Middleton Murry, Necessity of Cotam- /IIunismJ quoted in r A Jackson, Diaiectical Materialism. 4 John Lewis et al, Christiatnity und the Social Revoluitioni, London, 1935.
