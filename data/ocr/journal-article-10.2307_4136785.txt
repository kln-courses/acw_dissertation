<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOSEF VAN Ess. The Flowering of Muslim Theology. Translated by JANE MARIE TODD. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. 2006. Pp. vi, 220. $24.95. This is the English translation of four lectures delivered by Josef van Ess at the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris and published in French in 2002. The presence of the author's monumental history of Islamic theology (The- ologie und Gesellschaft im 2. und 3. Jahrhundert Hid- schra, 6 vols. [1991-1997]) is visible throughout: of the 207 footnotes in this short text, some 150 consist of di- rect references to it. Of the remaining, only a handful point to subsequent scholarship. The short introduction connects the present to the past. In an almost oracular manner, van Ess suggests that a revival of Islamic theology, and presumably the Mu'tazili creed in particular, is the only feasible defense against the current rise of puritanism and fundamen- talism. The conclusion, by contrast abandons all hope as the author sadly avows that reason and revelation remain as far apart today as they were in the golden age of Mu'tazili activity, when "the problem was revelation. No one would ever succeed in explaining it and replac- ing it with reason" (p. 190). The Mu'tazilis, who are introduced properly halfway through the first chapter, are characterized as court theologians with a deep aver- sion to anthropomorphism and predestination. In place of an analysis of the politics implied in the emblematic language for and against anthropomorphism or predes- tination, the reader is bluntly told that the theologians disapproved of the doctrines because they "hated" them (p. 31). The political and ideological explanation, as posited by H. A. R. Gibb more than half a century ago (reprinted in Gibb, Studies on the Civilization of Is- lam [1982], p. 205), no matter how rudimentary, is passed over in silence. A temporal haze envelopes the entire discourse. "Earlier," "later," "soon," "at first," "in the beginning," and "afterward" are substituted for years and centuries. In the introduction, van Ess dates the emergence of the competition between jurists and theologians to "that time when they still had some historical options avail- able to them, options that would become more limited later on" (p. 3). In other words, Mu'tazili theologians missed the opportunity to write the course of Islamic thought before its untimely anchylosis. Interestingly, the flowering of Muslim theology preceded its most ex- uberant growth period, for "the phenomenon reached its zenith very early; its most creative period did not occur after it had come of age, but well before, at a time when signs of tedium and paralysis had not yet ap- peared" (p. 4). This is not helpful to the reader encoun- tering the numerous inconsistencies with dates and per- sonages. Al-Asamm, the eighth- century Basran theologian whose contributions to Mu'tazili doctrine form a good part of the book's narrative, is only intro- duced on page 134, although frequently cited on the preceding pages. Al-Ghazzali, perhaps the best known of medieval Muslim theologians, is the only one intro- duced with birth and death dates in both Islamic and Christian calendars (p. 39). The chapter on heresy and division within Islam doc- uments the development of orthodoxy in the Islamic context, demonstrating that the absence of a formal church did not prohibit an orthodoxy from arising. The rest of the chapter is devoted to the discussion of the modus vivendi that developed among different Muslim sects in spite of this orthodoxy. Contrary to what is im- plied elsewhere, therefore, Islamic notions of tolerance seem to have outlived the Mu'tazilis. The second chapter is a history of the debate on an- thropomorphism. The Mu'tazilis are conspicuously ab- sent in this and the preceding chapter, although their struggle against anthropomorphism and their joint ef- fort with the caliphs to impose an orthodoxy across the empire has some influence on the discussions contained in them. The third chapter discusses atomism in Muslim theology, again a field of inquiry that continued to at- AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW APRIL 2007</page><page sequence="2">624 Reviews of Books tract the attention of Muslim intellectuals, and was by no means restricted to Mu'tazilis. The fourth chapter discusses idealized images of the Islamic past, and efforts by Muslim intellectuals to rec- oncile history with the idealized image. The fifth chap- ter, on the relationship between faith and knowledge, also serves as the book's conclusion and summarizes the development of key Mu'tazili concepts that dominated the debate on reason and revelation in Islamic thought. The author's formidable erudition pervades all five chapters. Unfortunately, what is lacking in this roll call of intellectuals and philosophies is an analytical frame- work. While the bulk of the book focuses on the eighth and ninth centuries, the conclusions are often applied uncritically to historical developments in the contem- porary world. This is not a foray into medieval Islamic political thought in an attempt to transform medieval expositions into windows onto a world view, 'i la Quen- tin Skinner. Nor is it a history of Muslim political the- ology highlighting key concepts and milestones that helped shape the development of political language and intellectual currents in Islam, the approach so well ex- emplified in Ernst Kantorowicz's classic study of Chris- tian political thought, The King's Two Bodies (1952). The book is a terse chronicle of the slow strangulation of rationalist Islam, and what is conceived as the re- sultant hold of militancy on the minds and hearts of Muslims today.
