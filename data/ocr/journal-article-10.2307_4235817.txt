<plain_text><page sequence="1">121 Chimpanzees, Science, and Ethics Barbara J. King Department of Anthropology College of William and Mary Williamsburg, Virginia 23185 Often the most important service that a reviewer offers to a book's potential readership is an uncovering, from within the same discipline, of the author's hidden biases. Beyond the stated theme of the book, does the author have an ax to grind, a view to push? It is refreshing when, as in Through a Window, the author herself reveals such biases (or most of them, anyway), even when it is likely that at least some will be met with skepticism. This book is a passionate account of the complexity of the lives led by chimpanzees, and of the need for humans to protect them and treat them ethically. In offering her arguments (and biases), Goodall shows that there is more than one way to gain valuable knowledge about other species. For Goodall, chimpanzees have personalities; feel emotions such as pleasure, anger, and sorrow in much the same way that humans do; and are exceedingly intelligent creatures capable of rational behavior (pp. 16-23). Argua- bly, her most valuable contribution to ethology and anthro- pology has been to show how differing behaviors by individual chimpanzees result in vastly different life histo- ries, even across generations. The case studies comparing different mothering styles (e.g., Fifi vs. Pom) and varying political ambition in adult males (e.g., Goblin vs. Jomeo) are particularly good in this regard. The 101 photographs (14 in color) beautifully complement such descriptions. I found the book most stimulating, though, because of its strong message about research on and treatment of chim- panzees. Goodall believes that, first, ethological research on wild chimpanzees need not always proceed in a so- called scientific manner, relying only on detached analysis of observed behaviors, so long as certain standards are observed. Second, and much more critically for the chim- panzees themselves, she calls for protection by humans of chimpanzees in both the wild and captivity. I will evaluate each of these arguments in turn. Given the similarity of emotional experience between chimpanzees and humans, Goodall believes that in study- ing chimpanzees "empathy and intuition can be of tremen- dous value as we attempt to understand certain complex behavioral interactions, provided that the behavior, as it occurs, is recorded precisely and objectively" (p. 17). An- thropomorphism, the ascribing of human emotions to animals, is therefore not the "cardinal sin" (p. 16) to Goodall that it is to most ethologists and anthropologists. I am not altogether sure why some of her anthropomorphic descriptions of chimpanzee behavior seemed acceptable, e.g., "Fifi was utterly fascinated and delighted by the new baby" (p. 34) or "a strong feeling of unity grew between the five older males" (p. 143), but others did not, e.g., in writing about Gilka, a female who, among other troubles, had health problems and whose baby was murdered by other females in the community, "Her life, begun with such promise, had unfolded into a tale of infinite sadness...(she) had become a pitiful cripple, and of all the chimpanzees at Gombe, the most lonely" (p. 84) or, written about the death of the chimpanzee Getty, "I feel quite sure, too, that among the chimps it was not only the members of his immediate family who missed him" (p. 75). Perhaps the difference between the two types of descrip- tion is this: given my own field experience with non- human primates, I can easily imagine that the chimpan- zees' behaviors, facial expressions, etc., could be "read" by a knowledgeable observer as fascination, delight, and unity. In these first two cases, Goodall, using her 30 years' association with these chimps, acts as cross-species trans- lator. The latter two descriptions, however, involve a judgement. How can Goodall possibly know whether Gilka was the loneliest chimp at Gombe? The quarrel here is not whether Gilka could feel loneliness or sadness, but whether Goodall is discussing Gilka's emotions or her own feelings about the chimps. Similarly, Goodall might expect Getty's associates to miss him, but what behavior did they exhibit to support this idea? In this book we are forewarned, quite fairly, that anthropomorphism is accept- able, but I think the latter descriptions go beyond it, and do not tell us much about the chimpanzees themselves. At other places in the book (e.g., p. 171,197) Goodall admits to strong feelings about the chimps or their behaviors, and after so long with them, it would seem odd if it were oth- erwise. The only problem is the occasional failure to separate the chimpanzees' feelings from her own.</page><page sequence="2">122 What of Goodall's plea for humane treatment of chim- panzees? She provides shocking anecdotes of chimpanzee suffering, whether as pets or as part of biomedicai research or the entertainment industry. These should convince anyone that protection is needed. Many of her recommen- dations, especially for the biomedicai community, are reasonable and practical: in the short term, make cages bigger, and enriched with objects; house pairs of chimps together, so the animals get all-important physical contact. In the long term, find better alternatives to using live animals for research. Real, if slow, progress is now accru- ing in these areas, as well as in saving chimpanzee habitat in Africa, because of Goodall's writing and activism. The approach she has taken is not incompatible with science and is worthy of respect. The labeling of this book as "astounding silliness...an intellectual tragedy" because "ideology intrudes with a vengeance" (Hearne, 1990) seems predicated on a misunderstanding, the view that scientists cannot produce objective data and be politically active at the same time. The key to success in doing so must be to admit one's priorities and objectives in each area. This is a complicated issue, to be sure, especially when Goodall's concerns translate into action at Gombe, e.g., when sick or injured chimpanzees are given medication by Goodall and her staff (p. 75,80,157,164,174,203). The consequences for certain data from Gombe must be closely analyzed by primatologists, a task made possible by Goo- dall's openness about her priorities and specific decisions. I was uncomfortable, however, with some analogies Goodall makes, e.g., likening the exportation of wild- born chimpanzees to distant countries for biomedicai research to the human slave trade (p. 221) and the subsequent conditions in captivity to concentration camps (p. 221, 230,246). These are powerful images, but they go too far; some distinction must be made between humans harming other humans intentionally and cruelly, and humans harm- ing chimpanzees, which is at least sometimes uninten- tional and based on the belief that higher good (i.e., good for humans) would result. This book engages us by raising the really critical questions of science and ethics: in addition to objective scientific analysis, how else can we learn about the behav- ior of other species? How can we decide what chimpan- zees know and feel? How best can biomedicai research proceed if not with animal models? In such research, is the cost in animal suffering outweighed by the benefits to humans? Whether or not one agrees with Goodall's scientific and political answers to these questions, the inescapable conclusion is that her book achieves its objec- tives. It communicates to the public the spectacular knowl- edge gained about chimpanzees at Gombe, and informs readers of the endangered status of wild chimpanzees and their plight in captivity. About the early phases of her career, Goodall wrote (p. 15): "... I had no desire to carve a niche for myself in the world of science, but simply wanted to go on living among and learning about chimpan- zees." This statement seems equally true today, with one addition. Goodall now wants to help protect the chimpan- zees of the world, and I suspect that if her readers come away with new compassion for them and other animals, and maybe even act on it, Goodall will feel the book did its job.
