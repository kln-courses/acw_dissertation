<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ANTS. By Wilhelm Goetsch. University o/ Michigan Press, Ann Arbor. $4.50. 169 pp.; ill. 1957. This attractive little book is a general treatment of the subject designed for the layman. It is eminently readable, and the illustrations are clear and mostly useful (some are borrowed without credit). Never theless, it has serious shortcomings. First it is padded as a result of the classical format. A page of conventional size (6 x 9 inches) would not only have allowed longer lines but would have per- mitted printing alongside the narrow figures; many of these spaces are left blank. The bottom margin is too wide; two more lines could have been accom- modated. The outer margins are wider than neces- sary, while the gutter is too narrow for convenience. But then, if space had been economized, the volume would probably have been too thin to bind in hard covers. The paper has a glossy finish which reflect,,. an unpleasant glare. This enameled stock is hardly justified by the 4 photographs, for they might just as well have been omitted. Then there are a number of outright errors. Just as bad are the many quasi-errors-words or state- ments which, although not literally wrong, are never- theless likely to mislead or confuse the reader. The latter may be the result of translation from the Ger- man by someone not familiar with myrmecological usage. Treatment of the brood is limited to half a page, which is strange considering the importance of the</page><page sequence="2">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 159 young animal societies. Behavior receives a dispro- portionately large share of the book, presumably be- cause this is the author's specialty. The treatment is free of anthropomorphism. In spite of the author's warning that his descriptions of behavior concern particular species, the reader nevertheless gets an impression that they apply to ants in general. With all its faults the book is still recommended to any layman who will skip the first 40 pages. On the whole, it is rather good, but it could have been so much better had it been edited by an English-speak- ing myrmecologist. GEORGE C. WHEELER</page></plain_text>
