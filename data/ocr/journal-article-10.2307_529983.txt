The archaeology of Neolithic SE Europe, as Ian Hodder has recently observed (1990: 71), is the archaeology of settlements, for it is through the analysis of settlement remains that our picture of these communities between 6000 and 4000 B.C. (re-calibrated) has been formed. Yet the number of settlements in SE Europe, particularly in the western Balkans (Yugoslavia, generally) that have been systematically investigated and reported is very small, par- ticularly when compared with the many large Neolithic sites of Central Europe. In most cases, sites are known from small trenches or sondages, excavated to establish chronology and to observe stratification. Many of the bet- ter-known were excavated decades ago. There is also a general impression in the literature that the larger sites are mostly tells, as at Vinea and Gomolava, a situation that is</page><page sequence="2">220 Book Reviews often contrasted with the expansive open sites of Central Europe. The Selevac Archaeological Project, in which fieldwork was carried out in 1976-1978 and analysis for several years thereafter, attempted to address this situation and to provide high-resolution data on a large Neolithic settle- ment. In this collaborative project between Yugoslav, pri- marily Serbian, and U.S.-based archaeologists, an explicit attempt was made to integrate the two nationalities into a single team with common research goals. These goals included the elucidation of chronology, the tracing of both intrasite and regional settlement patterns, and the inves- tigation of intensification of resource procurement and production in an early agricultural community. The field research at Selevac took place under a number of constraints. The key one is that the size of the excavated area was limited by a Yugoslav law which mandated that all opened trenches be carried down to sterile subsoil. This requirement, combined with a complicated pattern of modern landholdings, apparently precluded opening a sin- gle, large, continuous trench that could be excavated over several seasons and dictated instead the use of 4 x 4 m excavation units. This strategy is also the one favored by local archaeologists for the excavation of sites whose strat- ification and chronology are poorly known. Those of us who work in Eastern Europe know well the difficulties of having to reconcile local practices and limitations with the needs of research goals formulated in an American or Western European context. It is easy to accommodate diverse research goals in the programmatic statements, but when it comes to realizing them in the actual fieldwork, there is a continual process of negotiation and compro- mise. These constraints are often not faced by Western archaeologists who work in other parts of the world in which there is little tradition of indigenous archaeological research. The Selevac site report is a welcome volume describing this important project, on which very little has been hith- erto published. Until now, information on Selevac was limited to a single general article (Tringham et al. 1980), several interpretive syntheses (e.g., Kaiser and Voytek 1983), and a symposium organized at the 1980 Society for American Archaeology meetings in Philadelphia. This volume contains 15 descriptive chapters, whose authors and co-authors not only present the fundamental archae- ological data, but also provide an element of interpreta- tion. The "Conclusion" by Tringham and Krstie synthe- sizes these data and places them in their broader chronological, economic, and social setting. As a result, this volume differs from the typical European site report in which the data-presentation chapters are usually purely descriptive, of interest mainly to specialists. Here, one would miss quite a bit by just skipping to the conclusion, although there are parts that someone lacking an intense fascination with Balkan Neolithic sites would want to speed-read. John Chapman's chapter, nominally on the regional set- tlement pattern, is really a broad-ranging discussion of the local climate, soils, settlement pattern, and chronology of the Vinva culture. He notes the central position of Selevac in the regional drainage network and its proximity to fertile arable land. In the following chapter on chronology by Tringham and KrstiC, however, there seems to be some disagreement with Chapman's Vinva chronology. The dif- ficulty involves the status of the final building phase (IV) at Selevac, although for non-specialists in Vinia chronol- ogy like myself the extent and significance of this disagree- ment is difficult to fathom. In any event, it is handled diplomatically. The largest section of the volume [pp. 57-213] is a detailed presentation of the basic trench and feature data by Tringham and Mirjana Stevanovik. In addition to the documentation of the excavations, this section also initi- ates the interpretive discussion which establishes the se- quence of construction horizons and ultimately the defi- nition of four Stratigraphic-Architectural (S-A) phases. It is common in the Neolithic archaeology of SE Europe to differentiate between tell sites with their vertical stratifi- cation and extensive settlements with horizontal displace- ment of occupations. Selevac, interestingly, blurs this dis- tinction. Although the site covers at least 53 ha, the lower levels in the excavated area show vertical succession of structures, while the upper levels indicate the horizontal displacement that distributed archaeological debris over a wider area. Anthony Legge's discussion of the over 7000 identified mammal specimens focuses on the age and sex structure of the major mammalian taxa, data which he has also emphasized in his work at Grimes Graves, Star Carr, and other British sites. In a footnote, he indicates that there were also bones of small carnivores, beaver, bear, horse, and birds which were not yet fully identified at the time of the report, but we are not provided with further infor- mation about the quantity and nature of the remains of these taxa. These species are often very interesting for the information they provide about the exploitation of the local environment by the inhabitants of Neolithic sites, and it is unfortunate that they were not included in this report, which will likely be the primary documentation for the Selevac mammalian fauna for some time to come. One significant aspect of the faunal remains is that the bones of cervids-red deer and roe deer-are common in</page><page sequence="3">Journal of FieldArchaeology!/Vol. 19, 1992 221 the earlier building horizons but decline in quantity in later levels, which Legge takes to reflect the progressive deforestation of the area around Selevac. Cattle were used primarily for meat production, in Legge's view, which contrasts with the case he has made for Neolithic dairy production at sites in Northern Europe. A modest sample of fish bones analyzed by Dirk Brink- huizen includes catfish, carp, and pike. The small size of the stream near the site suggests that some of the larger individuals were caught somewhere further afield. The role of fish and other aquatic resources is an under-studied aspect of the economy of Neolithic sites in Europe. The botanical remains, analyzed by F.S. McLaren and R.N.L.B. Hubbard, are comparable with those from other Neolithic sites in SE Europe. Most samples contained traces of emmer and einkorn wheat, but there is a striking paucity of pulse and barley remains, which is interpreted as a real effect of cultural practices rather than a sampling or recovery bias. The ceramic artifacts are treated in four separate chap- ters by Timothy Kaiser ("Ceramic Technology"); Mirjana VukmanoviC and Nenad Radojvic ("Quantitative Analysis of the Pottery") with an appendix by Judith Rasson, Tringham, and Stevanovic ('The Nonceramic Uses of Clay"); and Jasmina MilokoviC ('The Anthropomorphic and Zoomorphic Figurines"). The volume of information in these chapters is imposing, although traditional Euro- pean stylistic analysis is at a minimum. Kaiser's chapter is an important case study in how archaeometric techniques can yield important information about human behavior beyond the simple reconstruction of technological pro- cesses. The term "nonceramic" in the chapter by Tringham and StevanoviC seems a wrong choice of words, for the artifacts described-fired clay portable objects on one hand and burnt wall daub on the other-are clearly "ce- ramic" in that they involve clay whose chemical compo- sition has been altered by heat and which cannot revert to its natural form. Barbara Voytek's chapter on the uses of stone resources considers both chipped stone and ground stone tools to- gether, a departure from the standard European practice of treating these as completely separate categories of ar- tifacts. The focus in this chapter is on the acquisition of raw materials, their reduction into stone tools, and their consumption as reflected in microwear. This approach is still relatively novel in later European prehistory, in which typological studies still predominate. A separate chapter by Carol Spears discusses the macrocrystalline stone arti- facts, primarily grinding stones. The discussion of bone tools by Nerissa Russell high- lights an artifact category that is often all but ignored on Neolithic sites but which can provide important infor- mation in understanding the manipulation of raw mate- rials. The Selevac excavations yielded over 1000 bone tools, making this one of the largest samples of such artifacts from a non-waterlogged Neolithic site in Europe. The final data-presentation chapter is by Peter Glumac and Tringham on the use of copper. The emergence of copper metallurgy in SE Europe took place during the Vinea culture, so the documentation of such settlement finds is crucial for understanding the context in which copper products were used. Of particular importance is the identification of copper slag, which has since been identified at several other contemporaneous sites in SE Europe. The concluding chapter, written by Tringham and Krstic, is perhaps the most conceptually interesting and of broadest interest: an evaluation of the Selevac data in light of the goals of the research and wider issues of European social evolution. After first evaluating the con- tribution of Selevac to the regional chronology (it is viewed as crucial to the understanding of the Gradac phase of the Vinea culture, referred to in passing in Chapter 3), the authors move to a consideration of the transformations of socioeconomic life over the duration of the Vinia set- tlement at Selevac. The essential theme of this section is that the household, defined as a co-resident domestic group, emerged as the primary unit of production and social reproduction in sE Europe during the Vinva culture. These households were in competition with each other for access to resources, status, and authority. This in turn triggered a cycle of intensification of production, which resulted in societal stresses particularly as "junior" house- holds were constrained in their social options. The model is compelling, especially in light of what we know about the dynamics of households in small-scale agrarian societies around the world. A number of its ele- ments resonate with recent discussions of the process of the establishment of agrarian communities in north-central Europe at roughly the same time (Bogucki 1988). It is here, however, that the initial constraints on the Selevac research which led it to excavate small exposures have limited the extent to which the Selevac data can support this model. The variability among architectural units can- not be fully studied, since it was not possible to expose them completely with all their surrounding features. Still, this chapter provides important food for thought and is a valuable contribution to the ongoing discussion of social processes in early European agricultural societies, which has been especially lively since the mid-1980s. The price of this volume is particularly low in light of its size, its good paper and typography, and its binding.</page><page sequence="4">222 Book Reviews It has an attractive look and inviting style. While the lavish illustrations, many computer-generated, are a bit baroque in places, they are generally clear and well-labeled. The only significant production disappointment was the qual- ity of reproduction of the plates at the back of the volume, especially those of artifacts. Many of them appear over- exposed, either during the initial photography or during printing. Unfortunately, the current political situation and civil unrest may preclude large-scale archaeological field re- search in Yugoslavia in the foreseeable future, so this may be one of the last such excavations of a Vin'a settlement for some time to come. Nonetheless, this report has sig- nificance beyond the immediate boundaries of the Vinca culture, for questions are being addressed by excavators of settlements in Hungary (e.g., Raczky 1987) and further afield in Poland (e.g., Grygiel 1986). Moreover, the em- phasis on the household as an analytical unit may provide useful comparative information for archaeologists who have been using similar analytical frameworks in other parts of the world such as Mesoamerica, where, although a good deal is written about "household clusters," there is still little integration of this concept into diachronic models of cultural change. From this perspective, Selevac, a Neolithic Village in Yugoslavia is a valuable conclusion to a project that many of us who study the European Neo- lithic have been hearing about for the last 15 years.
