<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILIPPE ARIÈS INVISIBLE DEATH by Philippe Ariès Death is not a purely individual act, any more than life is. Like every great milestone in life, death is celebrated by a cere- mony that is always more or less solemn and whose purpose is to express the individual's solidarity with his family and com- munity. The three most important moments of this ceremony have long been the dying man's acceptance of his active role, the scene of the farewells, and the scene of mourning. The rites in the bed- room or those of the oldest liturgy expressed the conviction that the life of a man was not an individual destiny but a link in the un- broken chain, the biological continuation of a family or a line that began with Adam and included the whole human race. One kind of solidarity subordinated the individual to the past and future of the species. Another kind made him an inte- gral part of his community. This community was gathered around the bed where he lay; later, in its rites of mourning, it expressed the anxiety caused by the passage of death. The com- munity was weakened by the loss of one of its members. It pro- claimed the danger it felt; it had to recover its strength and unity by means of ceremonies, the last of which always had the quality of a holiday, even a joyous one. In the early 20th century, before World War I, throughout the Western world of Latin culture, the death of a man still sol- emnly altered the space and time of a social group that could be extended to include the entire community. The shutters were closed in the bedroom of the dying man, candles were lit, the house filled with grave and whispering neighbors, relatives, and friends. At the church, the bell tolled. After death, a notice of bereavement was posted on the door (in lieu of the abandoned custom of exhibiting the body or the coffin by the door of the house). All the doors and windows of the house were closed except the front door, which was left ajar to admit everyone who was obliged by friendship or good manners to make a final visit. The service at the church brought the whole community together, and after the long line of people had expressed their sympathy to the family, a slow procession, sa- luted by passersby, accompanied the coffin to the cemetery. The The Wilson Quarterly /Winter 1981 105</page><page sequence="2">PHILIPPE ARIÈS period of mourning was filled with visits: visits of the family to the cemetery and visits of relatives and friends to the family. Then, little by little, life returned to normal. The social group had been stricken by death, and it had reacted collec- tively, starting with the immediate family and extending to a wider circle of relatives and acquaintances. Not only did every- one die in public like Louis XIV, but the death of each person was a public event that moved, literally and figuratively, society as a whole. It was not only an individual who was disappearing but society itself that had been wounded and that had to be healed. Concealing the Truth All the changes that have modified attitudes toward death in the past thousand years have not altered this fundamental image, this permanent relationship between death and society. Death has always been a social and public fact. It remains so to- day in vast areas of the Latin West, and it is by no means clear that this traditional model is destined to disappear. But it no longer has the quality of absolute generality that it once had, no matter what the religion and the culture. In the course of the 20th century, an absolutely new type of dying has made an ap- pearance in some of the most industrialized, urbanized, and technologically advanced areas of the Western world - and this is probably only the first stage. Two characteristics are obvious to the most casual ob- server. Its novelty, of course, its contrariness to everything that preceded it, of which it is the reverse image, the negative. Ex- cept for the death of statesmen, society has banished death. In the towns, there is no way of knowing that something has hap- pened. The old black and silver hearse has become an ordinary gray limousine, indistinguishable from the flow of traffic. Soci- ety no longer observes a pause; the disappearance of an individ- ual no longer affects its continuity. Everything in town goes on Philippe Aries, 66, a former Wilson Center Fellow, is director of studies at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, Paris. Born in Blois, France, he was trained at the Sorbonne, where he studied history and geog- raphy. Two of his books are available in English: Centuries of Childhood (1965), and Western Attitudes Toward Death (1974).

The second characteristic is no less surprising. Or course, death has changed in a thousand years, but how slowly! The changes were so gradual and so infinitesimal, spread out over generations, that they were imperceptible to contemporaries. Today a complete reversal of customs seems to have occurred in one generation. After the second half of the 19th century, an essential change occurred in the relationship between the dying man and his entourage. Obviously, the discovery that one's end was near has always been an unpleasant moment. But people learned to overcome it. The Church saw to it that the doctor carried out the role of her- ald of death. The role was not a coveted one, and it required the zeal of the "spiritual friend" to succeed where the "earthly friend" hesitated. When the warning did not happen spontane- ously, it was part of the customary ritual. But during the later 19th century, it became more and more problematical, as we see from a story in Tolstoi's "Three Deaths," which appeared in 1859. The Wilson Quarterly /Winter 1981 107</page><page sequence="4">PHILIPPE ARIÈS The wife of a rich businessman has contracted tuberculosis, as happened so often at that time. The doctors have pronounced her condition hopeless. The moment has come when she has to be told. There is no question of avoiding it, if only to allow her to make her "final arrangements." But here is a new element: The distaste of the entourage for this duty has increased. The hus- band refuses "to tell her about her condition/' because, he says, "It would kill her No matter what happens, it is not I who will tell her." The mother of the dying woman is also reluctant. As for the dying woman, she talks about nothing but new treat- ments. Behind this reluctance, even when it grates under the satiri- cal pen of Tolstoi, there is the love of the other, the fear of hurt- ing him and depriving him of hope, the temptation to protect him by leaving him in ignorance of his imminent end. The mod- ern attitude toward death is an extension of the "affectivity" of the 19th century. The last inspiration of this inventive affectiv- ity was to protect the dying or very ill person from his own emo- tions by concealing the seriousness of his condition until the end. When the dying man discovered the pious game, he lent himself to it so as not to disappoint the other's solicitude. The dying man's relations with those around him were now deter- mined by a respect for this loving lie. Yet, in order for the dying man, his entourage, and the soci- ety that observed them to consent to this situation, the protec- tion of the patient had to outweigh the joys of a last communion with him. The last communion with God and/or with others was the great privilege of the dying. For centuries there was no ques- tion of depriving him of this privilege. But when the lie was maintained to the end, it eliminated this. Even when it was re- ciprocal and conspiratorial, the lie destroyed the spontaneity, pathos, and public nature of the last moments. The beginning of the 20th century saw the completion of this psychological mechanism that removed death from society and eliminated its character of public ceremony. This is the first milestone in the modern history of death. "Not Receiving" The second great milestone in the contemporary history of death is the rejection and elimination of mourning. Mourning in the true sense of the word comes after the funeral and burial. The pain of loss may continue to exist in the secret heart of the survivor, but the rule today, almost throughout the West, is that he must never show it in public. This is exactly the opposite of The Wilson Quarterly IW inter 1981 108</page><page sequence="5">PHILIPPE ARIÈS what used to be required. In France since about 1970, the long line of people offering their condolences to the family after the religious service has been eliminated. And in the country, the death notice, though still sent out, is accompanied by the dry, almost uncivil formula, "The family is not receiving," a way of avoiding the customary visits of neighbors and acquaintances before the funeral. But generally speaking, the initiative for the refusal is not taken by the survivors. By withdrawing and avoiding outside contact, the family is affirming the authenticity of its grief, which bears no comparison to the solicitude of well-meaning relatives; it is also adopting the discreet behavior that society requires. The Denial of Death Indeed, the transition from the calm and monotonous world of everyday reality to the inner world of the feelings is never made spontaneously or without help. The distance between the languages is too great. In order to establish communication, it is necessary to have an accepted code of behavior, a ritual that is learned by experience from childhood. Once, there were codes for all occasions, codes for revealing to others feelings that were generally unexpressed, codes for courting, for giving birth, for dying, for consoling the bereaved. These codes no longer exist. They disappeared in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. So feelings too intense for the ordinary forms either do not find ex- pression and are held in, or break forth with intolerable violence because there is no way to channel them. In the latter case, they threaten the order and security necessary to daily activity. Therefore, they must be repressed. It is for this reason that everything having to do first with love and then with death became forbidden. This taboo became necessary after the gates and dams that had contained these wild forces for thousands of years were abandoned. Thus, a model was born, especially in the English public schools, of virile courage, discretion, and propriety, which forbade public allusion to romantic feelings and tolerated them only in the pri- vacy of the home. A new situation appears around the middle of the 20th cen- tury in the most individualistic and middle-class parts of the West. There is a conviction that the public demonstration of mourning (like love), as well as its too-insistent or too-long pri- vate expression, is inherently morbid. As British sociologist Geoffrey Gorer has written, "At present, death and mourning The Wilson Quarterly IW inter 1981 109</page><page sequence="6">PHILIPPE ARIES are treated with much the same prudery as the sexual impulses were a century ago." Weeping is synonymous with hysteria. Mourning is a malady. This disparaging attitude begins to ap- pear in subtle form in the postromantic sarcasm, still mingled with romantic beliefs, of Mark Twain. Twain is both annoyed and moved by theatrical demonstrations, and defends himself from antiquated sentiments with humor. Today, this attitude has become common. The period of mourning is no longer marked by the silence of the bereaved amid a solicitous and in- discreet entourage, but by the silence of the entourage itself. The telephone does not ring. The bereaved is in quarantine. The suppression of mourning is not due to the frivolity of survivors but to a merciless coercion applied by society. Society refuses to participate in the emotion of the bereaved. This is a way of denying the presence of death in practice, even if one ac- cepts its reality in principle. As far as I can see, this is the first time that the denial has expressed itself so openly. For some time, this denial had been rising from the depths where it had been thrust, moving toward the surface without yet reaching it: from the Victorian fear of being buried alive, to the time when The death of Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria, at Buckingham Palace, 1861. In the 19th century, Aries writes, death came to be seen as "moving and beautiful, like the immensity of nature, the sea, the moors." From the collection of Mrs. Betty OLooney.

The Wilson Quarterly /Winter 1981 110</page><page sequence="7">PHILIPPE ARIÈS one concealed the death of the other out of love and concealed the sick person from others out of disgust. From now on, the de- nial of death is openly acknowledged as a significant trait of our culture. The tears of the bereaved have become comparable to the excretions of the diseased. Both are distasteful. Death has been banished. Resting in Peace? As we have seen, the romantic model as it existed in the middle of the 19th century underwent a gradual dismantling. First, in the late 19th century, there were the changes that occurred in the early stages of dying, the period of very serious illness during which the patient was kept in ignorance and isola- tion. Then, in the 20th century, came the taboo against mourn- ing and everything in public life that reminded one of death. There remained only the actual moment of death, which long re- tained its traditional characteristics: the reviewing of the life, the public quality, the scene of the farewells. But after World War II, even this last survival disappeared, owing to the com- plete medicalization of death. This is the third milestone. The essential fact is the well-known advance in surgical and medical techniques. As soon as an illness seems serious, the doc- tor usually sends his patient to the hospital. Advances in surgery have brought parallel advances in resuscitation and in the re- duction or elimination of pain and sensation. These procedures are no longer used only before, during, or after an operation; they have been extended to all the dying, in order to relieve their pain. For example, the dying man is given food and water intra- venously, thus sparing him the discomfort of thirst. A tube runs from his mouth to a pump that drains his mucus and prevents him from choking. Doctors and nurses administer sedatives. By a swift and imperceptible transition, someone who was dying came to be treated like someone recovering from major surgery. This is why, especially in the cities, people stopped dy- ing at home - just as they stopped being born at home. In New York City in 1967, 75 percent of all deaths occurred in hospitals or similar institutions, as compared with 69 percent in 1955 (60 percent for the United States as a whole). The proportion of deaths in hospitals has risen steadily since then. This transfer of death to the hospital has had profound con- sequences. It has accelerated an evolution that began in the late 19th century and pushed it to its logical conclusion. Death has been redefined. In the traditional mentality, the sense of the mo- ment of death was softened by the certainty of a continuation: The Wilson Quarterly /Winter 1981 111</page><page sequence="8">PHILIPPE ARIÈS Death in the Hospital (1926) by José Gutierrez Solatia: "Hospital personnel have defined an 'acceptable style of facing death.1 This is the death of the man who pretends he is not going to die." From José Gutierrez Solana by José I. Barrio-Garay. Bucknelt University Press, 1976. not necessarily the immortality of the Christians but a subdued prolongation of some kind. After the 17th century, the more widespread belief in the duality of the soul and the body and in their separation at death eliminated the margin of time. Death became an instant. The medicalized death of today has restored this margin, but by borrowing time from this life, not from the beyond. The time of death has been both lengthened and subdivided. The doctor cannot eliminate death, but he can control its duration, from the few hours it once was, to several days, weeks, months, or even years. It has become possible to delay the fatal moment; the measures taken to soothe pain have the secondary effect of prolonging life. Sometimes, this prolonging of life becomes an end in itself, and hospital personnel refuse to discontinue the treatments that maintain an artificial life. The world will remember the Shake- spearean agony of Franco, surrounded by his 20 doctors. The most sensational case is no doubt that of Karen Ann Quinlan, an American girl of 22 whose mechanical respirator was turned off in March 1976 to allow her to die but who was still alive nearly The Wilson Quarterly /Winter 1981 112</page><page sequence="9">PHILIPPE ARIÈS five years later being fed and given antibiotics intravenously. No one expects that she will ever regain consciousness. It is not our purpose here to discuss the ethical problems raised by this rare case of "therapeutic tenacity." What interests us is that medicine can cause someone who is almost dead to remain alive almost indefinitely; and not only medicine but the hospital it- self, that is, the whole system that turns medical activity into a business bureaucracy and that obeys strict regulations regard- ing method and discipline. Death has ceased to be accepted as a natural, necessary phe- nomenon. Death is a "failure." This is the attitude of the doctor, who claims the control of death as his mission in life. But the doctor is merely a spokesman for society, although more sensi- tive and radical than the average person. When death arrives, it is regarded as an accident, a sign of helplessness or clumsiness that must be put out of mind. It must not interrupt the hospital routine, which is more delicate than that of another professional milieu. It must therefore be discreet. The patient's passivity is maintained by sedatives, especially at the end, when the pain becomes unbearable and would otherwise produce the "horrible screams" of Ivan Ilyich or Madame Bovary. Morphine controls the great crises, but it also diminishes a consciousness that the patient then recovers only intermittently. Such is today's "acceptable style of facing death." Death no longer belongs to the dying man, who is first irresponsible, later unconscious, nor to the family, who are convinced of their inad- equacy. Death is regulated and organized by bureaucrats whose competence and humanity cannot prevent them from treating death as their "thing," a thing that must bother them as little as possible in the general interest. Nature Imprisoned From the earliest times, man has regarded neither sex nor death as crude facts of nature per se. The necessity of organizing work and maintaining order and morality in order to have a peaceful life in common led society to protect itself from the violent and unpredictable forces of nature. These included both external nature, with its intemperate seasons and sudden acci- dents; and the internal world of the human psyche, which re- sembles nature in its suddenness and irregularity, the world of the ecstasy of love and the agony of death. A state of equilibrium was achieved and maintained by means of a conscious strategy to contain and channel the unknown and formidable forces of nature. Death and sex were the weak points in the defense sys- The Wilson Quarterly /Winter 198Î 113</page><page sequence="10">PHILIPPE ARIÈS tern, because here there was no clear break in continuity be- tween culture and nature. So these activities had to be carefully controlled. The ritualization of death was a special aspect of the total strategy of man against nature, a strategy of prohibitions and concessions. This is why death was not permitted its natu- ral extravagance but was imprisoned in ceremony, transformed into spectacle. This is also why it could not be a solitary adven- ture but had to involve the whole community. The Retreat of Evil How are we to explain the current abdication of the com- munity? How has the community come to reverse its role and to forbid the mourning that it was responsible for imposing until the 20th century? The answer is that the community felt less and less involved in the death of one of its members. First, be- cause it no longer thought it necessary to defend itself against a nature that had been domesticated once and for all by the advance of technology, especially medical technology. Next, because it no longer had a sufficient sense of solidarity. The "community" in the traditional sense of the word no longer existed. It had been replaced, first by the family, next by an enormous mass of atomized individuals. But this disappearance does not explain the powerful resur- gence of other prohibitions. This vast and formless mass that we call society is, as we know, maintained and motivated by a new system of constraints and controls. It is also subject to irresisti- ble movements that put it in a state of crisis and impose a tran- sitory unity of aggression or denial. One of these movements has unified mass society against death. More precisely, it has led society to be ashamed of death. This shame is a direct consequence of the definitive retreat of "evil." As early as the 18th century, man had begun to reduce the power of the devil, to question his reality. Hell was aban- doned, at least in the case of relatives and dear friends. Along with hell went sin and all the varieties of spiritual and moral evil. They were no longer regarded as part of human nature but as social problems that could be eliminated by a good system of supervision and punishment. The general advance of science, morality, and organization would lead quite easily to happiness. But in the middle of the 19th century, there was still the obsta- cle of illness and death. There was no question of eliminating that. The romantics circumvented or assimilated it. They beau- tified death, gateway to an anthropomorphic beyond. They pre- served its immemorial association with illness, pain, and agony; The Wilson Quarterly /Winter 1981 114</page><page sequence="11">PHILIPPE ARIÈS these things aroused pity rather than distaste. The trouble be- gan with distaste: Before people thought of abolishing physical illness, they ceased to tolerate its sight, sounds, and smells. Medicine reduced pain; it even succeeded in eliminating it altogether. The goal glimpsed in the 18th century had almost been reached. Evil no longer clung to man, it was no longer part of human nature, as the religions, especially Christianity, be- lieved. It still existed, of course, but outside of man, in certain deviant behaviors such as war, crime, and nonconformity, which had not yet been corrected but which would one day be eliminated by society. But if there is no more evil, what do we do about death? To this question modern society offers two answers. The first is a massive admission of defeat. We ignore the ex- istence of a scandal that we have been unable to prevent; we act as if it did not exist, and thus mercilessly force the bereaved to say nothing. A heavy silence has fallen over the subject of death. When this silence is broken, as it sometimes is in America today, it is to reduce death to the insignificance of an ordinary event that is mentioned with feigned indifference. Either way, the re- sult is the same: Neither the individual nor the community is strong enough to recognize the existence of death. And yet this attitude has not annihilated death or the fear of death. On the contrary, it has allowed the old savagery to creep back under the mask of medical technology. The death of the pa- tient in the hospital, covered with tubes, is becoming a popular image, more terrifying than the transi or skeleton of macabre rhetoric. A small elite of anthropologists, psychologists, and sociolo- gists has been struck by this contradiction. They propose not so much to "evacuate" death as to humanize it. They acknowledge the necessity of death, but they want it to be accepted and no longer shameful. Death must simply become the discreet but dignified exit of a peaceful person from a helpful society that is neither torn nor overly upset by the idea of a biological transi- tion without significance, without pain or suffering, and ulti- mately without fear.
