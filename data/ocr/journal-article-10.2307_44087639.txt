At an ecocritical moment when concerns over planetary peril and environmental toxicity drive discussions about the death of Nature, Material Feminisms offers a refreshing reminder that the body, both human and nonhuman, still "matters." As editors and contributors to this compelling collection of essays, Stacy Alaimo and Susan Hekman call upon ecocritics and material feminists alike to embrace material- ity, the body, and the "stuff" of nature. The selected scholars in this volume respond to those postmodern perspectives that have "rele- gated ecofeminism to the backwoods" and viewed the connection between "feminism and environmentalism" as overly romanticized (Alaimo and Hekman, Introduction, 4). By dismantling the dualisms of "male/female," "culture/nature," "mind/body," "subject/object," and "rational/emotional" (2-3), Material Feminisms coercively coun- ters the poststructuralist privileging of "language" over "reality." Alaimo and Hekman argue that the very materiality of place and the body fosters an ecological interconnectedness between human and nonhuman natures, male and female bodies and minds, cultural and natural spaces, and linguistic discourses and material entities. By organizing this book into three parts ("Material Theory," "Material World," and "Material Bodies"), Alaimo and Hekman insightfully illustrate how language, environment, and corporality intersect through the "stuff" of nature. Part 1 begins with Grosz's effective effort to forge an ecological connection between "Darwin and Feminism" and concludes with Karen Barad's persuasive point that because "language has been granted too much power," the body of nature has ceased to "matter" (120). Barad's essay on "Posthumanist Performativity" functions as a smooth transition into Part 2 by shifting from the theoretical framework of Material Feminisms to an examination of the physical spaces that house human and nonhuman ecologies. The five essays within this second section rethink the natural world beyond anthropomorphic constructions of "reification, possession, appropriation, and nostalgia" (Haraway,</page><page sequence="2">206 ISLE "Otherworldly Conversations," 158). Through their unique approach to the material and the feminine, Donna J. Haraway, Vicki Kirby, and others challenge the long-held view of Nature as a privileged patriar- chal construction that lies beyond the boundaries, but falls subject to the domination, of Western culture. The book culminates with five essays related to timely topics of environmental and economic inequalities; through "Material Bodies," Susan Bordo, Michael Hames-Garcia, Tobin Siebers, and others express injustices of race, gender, ethnicity, disability, sexuality, and class. Material Feminisms offers a fascinating perspective on the biologi- cal and social interactions between human and nonhuman bodies and thus illustrates how deeply intertwined discourses of disability and environment are. In "Disability Experience on Trial," Siebers says that human architectures have discriminatory hierarchies embedded within them, and then begs the question: what must we change first, attitudes toward the disabled or spatial configurations? In addressing this question, I realize that the dualistic distinction between space as physical territory and place as psychological terrain deserves further consideration within this book. Nevertheless, Alaimo and Hekman have, through their strong scholarship and elegant editing, done a brilliant job of reminding ecocritics that nature never ceases to matter.
