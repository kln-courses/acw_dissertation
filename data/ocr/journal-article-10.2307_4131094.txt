Field evaluation of a visual barrier to dis- courage gull nesting. P. A. Pochop, J. L. Cummings, and R. M. Engeman. 2001. Pacific Conservation Biol- ogy 7:143-145.-Recent increases in gull populations in Washington state, USA, have had a negative impact on three species of salmon in the Columbia and Snake rivers systems. This paper reports on a pilot study on Upper Nelson Island in the Columbia River that at- tempted to reduce gull nesting, mostly Ring-billed Gulls (Larus delawarensis), using black woven polypropylene silt-fencing as visual barriers. Seventy-m square control and study plots (12% of available nesting habitat) were set up prior to nesting, with 15 rows of fencing in par- allel rows placed on the experimental plot. Eighty-four percent fewer gulls nested in the fenced experimental plot than in the control plot, but it appeared that the displaced gulls moved to smaller satellite colonies in less suitable habitat. Additional study would be required to determine how much of the island would need to be fenced to prevent gull nesting.

Davis, Jr. 2. A dissolving leg harness for radio transmit- ter attachment in treecreepers. V. A. J. Doerr and E. D. Doerr. 2002. Corella 26:19-21.-One of the ma- jor concerns in radio telemetry with birds is the attach- ment method for transmitters. The authors report on modifications to the Rappole and Tipton attachment method that employs a leg harness and has the trans- mitter sitting on the bird's synsacrum. Two problems with this method are that it works best with birds with long external thighs, and that the transmitter is per- manently attached. The authors modified the method to accommodate the short external thighs of two species of Australian treecreepers. The first modification was to use dissolving suture as the harness material so that the transmitter was not permanently attached to the bird. The second modification was to customize the fit for each bird by making the harness adjustable. Transmitters were attached to 68 treecreepers. Of these, 5 were dep- redated, and from the remainder, 12 transmitters were prematurely shed, all by female birds. In 85% of non- dispersing resident birds the harnesses remained in place for at least three months, with a mean of 149 days.

I (see also 21) 2 (see 1, 7, 8, 11, 21, 24) C. B. Frith and D. W. Frith. 2001. Australian Bird Watcher 19:3-13.-The authors report on their obser- vations of a previously unreported element in the bower display behavior of the Golden Bowerbird, an Australian endemic species that is the smallest of the bowerbirds. The species is a dimorphic, promiscuous breeder, in which the male constructs an elaborate bower to attract females. Previously, three elements of male Golden Bow- erbird display behavior have been recognized: the "bow," the "head-nod-and-shake," and the "flight/hover," but the order or place of each in the courtship progression was unknown. Males were also known to displace visi- tors to the bower perch. Most previous observations had been constrained by making observation from a blind where visibility was limited to the area immediately around the bower. This constraint was removed by the discovery of a bower next to a public path where the male and conspecifics had become habituated to human presence and hence a blind was unnecessary for obser- vation. The authors observed a new display that they call a "hiding" display, in which the male moves away from a visiting female and conceals himself by clinging to a tree trunk or vine while mimicking calls of other birds, including rosellas, cockatoos, riflebirds, and frogs, and peeking from behind the vegetation at his bower and the visiting bird. The male then typically hops to the leaf litter and performs a zig-zag run culminating in the male displacing the visiting bird. The authors sug- gest that the probable sequence of events when a female- plumaged bird visits the bower is: the male performs the "bow and head-nod," and "shake" displays followed by a "flight/hover" display. Then the male moves away and performs the "hiding" display while mimicking other birds or frogs. When the female has settled on the bower perch, the male performs the zig-zag run and displaces the female. Presumably, more receptive females would return to the bower perch while female plumaged males and less receptive females would leave the bower area. ['Prionodura', P.O.

An Australian Pelican Pelecanus conspicil- latus benefits from the beating behaviour of a Pied Cormorant Phalacrocorax various: a possible precursor to kleptoparasitism. 0. P. Love and C. A. D. Semeniuk. 2002. Corella 26:27-30.-The authors describe the parasitic behavior of an Australian Pelican using a Pied Cormorant as a "beater," and speculate on how kleptoparasitism could evolve from such behavior. The observations occurred at Shark Bay, Western Aus- tralia, where pelicans frequent the shoreline around hu- man structures, and may benefit from handouts from local fisherman. For 18 min an Australian Pelican fol- lowed a foraging Pied Cormorant, reversing direction when the cormorant did, and intercepted fish herded by the cormorant on 17 occasions. The cormorant could not protect the fish resource it was pursuing, its behavior was quite predictable, and its foraging behavior quite visible, all factors that could promote parasitic behavior 99</page><page sequence="2">100 Recent Literature J. Field Ornithol. by the pelican. Also, the observations occurred during the Australian winter so that food shortages may have been a factor. The authors suggest that the parasitic be- havior of the pelican may be a precursor to the devel- opment of kletoparasitism. Conditions that might lead to this development include a clumping of resources and foraging birds with resulting increased competition within and among species.

The breeding biology of the Biscutate Swift (Streptoprocne biscutata) in southern Brazil. Mau- ro Pichorim. 2002. Ornithol. Neotrop. 13:61-84.- The author studied the Biscutate Swift 1994-1996 in a granite cave in Paran'a State in southern Brazil. Swifts inhabit the cave year round but their number varies from about 260 in spring to 150 in winter. All but 2 of the 60 nests were built in the same location as a nest during the previous year. Nest sites were characterized by a horizontal or near horizontal shelf, 3-8 m above the floor of the cave. The mean outside dimensions were 14 x 18 cm and a depth of 2.8 cm. Nests were con- structed mostly of mosses, lichens, and other vegetative material carried to the site in the birds' bills. An average of 2 (range, 1-4) eggs are laid, 1 egg per day. Incubation lasts 24 days. The young hatch blind and without feath- ers. Down begins appearing in 2-4 days. Young leave the nest after about 33 days. The paper contains a great deal of detail on the description of the nest and devel- opment of the young birds. These data should be im- portant for a comparison with other species. The one bit of information that is missing is nest success. [Curso de P6s-GraduaSao em Zoologia, Univ. Federal do Para- na, Cx.

Silva e Silva. 2002. Ornithol. Neotrop. 13: 1730.-The authors studied 75 nests in 1997 and 65 nests in 1998 at a breeding colony on the Saboo River and 58 nests in 1997 on the Morrao River. In both colonies herons built their nests in mangroves. The nests were lower in the red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) of the Morrao Colony than in the white mangroves (La- guncularia racemosa) of the Saboo colony. Scarlet Ibis (Eudocimus ruber) were the most common nesting spe- cies on the Sabo6 and might have been responsible for causing the herons to nest lower. Clutch size (man 2.21 eggs) was smaller than in North America (2.57 eggs). The number of young produced per nest (mean 0.53) was also lower (0.98 in North America) and parental care continued longer.

Olamastroni, 3 (see 4, 24) 4 (see also 1, 3, 18, 20, 24) C. Callegarin, S. Corsolini, and S. Focardi. 2001. Ibis 143:681-684.-Previous studies found that extrapair copulations among Adelie Penguins are frequent (- 10%). In this study, researchers investigated whether extrapair paternity took place in the Adelie Penguins just as fre- quently. The study took place at a nesting colony of about 2000 nests, at Edmonson Point, Victoria Land, Antarc- tica. Eighteen paired adults were marked with transpon- der implants, and monitored daily 2-3 days prior to egg laying. During the incubation or guarding period, adults were caught and a blood sample was taken. Similarly, a blood sample from the offspring was taken within 2 weeks of hatching. The researchers used multilocus DNA fingerprinting to determine paternity. Two of the 22 (- 10%) young in the study were not the offspring of the attending male. Thus, rates of extrapair copulations and extrapair paternity are similar in Adelie Penguins at this location. More study is needed, however, to examine why extrapair paternity is so high in a species where parental care is evenly shared between sexes.

The King Penguin Aptenodytes patagonicus, a non-nesting bird which selects its breeding hab- itat. J. Bried and P. Jouventin. 2001. Ibis 143:670- 673.-In order to maximize reproductive output birds should choose a breeding site based on "ideal" distribu- tion models. However, evidence for nest-site selection in King Penguins is limited. In this study, researchers ex- amined the homogeneity of breeding habitat in a colony of King Penguins, attempted to determine if penguins chose their building sites, and looked at those factors that influenced which sites they chose, assuming they did. Re- searchers studied a colony of 750 paired King Penguins at the Crique de la Chaloupe on Possession Island in the Indian Ocean. To map the colony, it was divided into 10 X 10 m squares. In the colony, 989 birds were flipper banded and observed for half a day, every third day. Both chicks and breeders were mapped every tenth day. To determine the success of nesting birds at different loca- tions within the colony, the age of chicks at each location was estimated. A nest was considered successful if one of the adults was feeding their chicks after September or molting after November. A nest was considered a failure if a mate was molting before December or courtship was displayed in early December. King Penguins in the center of the colony had the highest nest success, and the center of the colony tended to be occupied by penguins that arrived the earliest. Later arrivals filled the colony's pe- riphery. One reason for the higher success rate was that the center of the colony was higher in elevation, and was protected more from flooding. The authors concluded that breeding habitat is not homogeneous, and nest site selection is non-random and corresponds with areas in which penguins were previously successful at rearing young.

Included in the list were feral cats (Felis catus) and Silver Gulls (Laurus novaehol- Iandiae), both prominent nest predators. Pied Oyster- catchers (Haematopus longirostris) took tern chicks and probably eggs. Whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus) tracks and feathers were found in predated tern colonies. Black rats (Rattus rattus) were implicated in many predation events, but water rats (Hydromys chrysogaster), although present, were not. Invertebrate nest predators included ghost crabs (Ocypode cordimana) that were frequent predators on both eggs and chicks, and ants (Iridomyr- mex gracilis). Possible predators included galahs (Cacatua roseicapilla), Caspian Terns (S. caspia), corvids, and sev- eral raptor species. The author's descriptions of preda- tion events and the evidence identifying the predators are detailed and comprehensive.

Corella 26: 13-18.-The Reef Egret (Pacific Reef-Egret), a species with dark and light morphs, occupies a fundamentally different habitat from all other Australian herons. This study reports on observations of the breeding biology of this species and makes comparisons with the breeding biology of the Cattle Egret (Ardeola ibis). The study, involving 32 nests, was conducted on Heron Island on the southern Great Barrier Reef, Queensland. The usual parameters of nest distribution and nest site character- istics were recorded, along with observation of the pre- nest building through fledging stages, including agonis- tic and courtship behavior. There were significantly more dark/white pairs than dark/dark or white/white. Incubation was shared evenly by pairs, and occupied about 22 h/day. Reef Egrets generally feed at low tide, and this coincided with periods of absence from the nest, although long periods of incubation caused them to miss some feeding periods. In contrast to Cattle Egrets, that leave older chicks unguarded much of the day, Reef Egrets roosted within sight of their nests dur- ing the high tide cycle, and their standing guard at some distance from the nest may have protected the nest lo- cation from potential predators. In contrast to the co- lonially breeding Cattle Egret that must constantly guard against piracy for nesting material, the dispersed nesting behavior of the Reef Egrets allowed for substan- tial periods away from nests under construction. The author suggests that unlike most egret species, Reef Egrets often fledge but a single chick, but may raise a second brood, possibly an adaptation to the sparse food resources provided by their reef environment.

Evidence from semicolonial Kes- trels Falco tinnunculus. L. Salvati. 2001. Vogelwelt 122:41-45.-The author compared breeding success of the Eurasian Kestrel populations in central Rome with populations in more rural agriculture locations nearby. There was an inverse but nonlinear relationship between breeding density and the number of young fledged. Pop- ulations with more than 2.5 breeding pairs/km2 pro- duced fewer than 3 young per nest; populations with 1 breeding pair/km2 produced 3.2-4.2 young/nest. Al- though influenced by population density, the distance from a nest to its nearest neighbor's nest influenced fledging success in a linear fashion. The greatest nest success was in nests that were the farthest from the neighboring nest. The high nesting densities in urban Rome are the result of the large number of nest sites provided by the buildings. The lower nest success at higher nest densities is thought to be density dependent but there were no data to indicate whether the mecha- nism is reduced food availability, increased aggression, or some other factor.

Riffell, and S. H. Anderson. 2002. Journal of Wildlife Management 66(2): 372-380.-Birds fre- quently experience human intrusion in the form of rec- reation and ecotourism during the breeding season in habitats necessary for successful nesting. Little research has been conducted to determine if these intrusions might influence the number of larid and corvid nest predators. In this study performed in subalpine forests in Wyoming, the Gray Jay (Perisoreus canadensis) is the primary corvid nest predator. Because it is unclear whether human intrusion increases or decreases the number of visits made by a nest predator, or the total number of individuals that visit, it is not known what affect these intrusions have on overall nesting success for forest songbird communities. The experiment was con- ducted on 30 1-ha circular plots 70 km WNW of Lar- amie. The treatments involved intrusion on just the in- ner 25% on ten of the plots, intrusion on 100% of ten plots, and ten control plots. The plots were sampled with point counts once a week for ten weeks. Both the average number of Gray Jays and the probability of re- occurrence were higher in the treated plots than in the controls during all five years sampled, although only sig- nificantly so during the first two years. The authors sug- gest that the lower number of Gray Jays in 1991-1993 was likely the result of repeated, unrewarded reactions to experimental intruders by resident birds in previous years. The suggestion that more Gray Jays visiting a hab- itat will result in a higher nest predation rate is unproven and should be tested before conclusions about the neg- ative affect of human intruders on forest nesting song- bird communities are made.

Nest cavity trees were found by nest searching and call surveys. Adults were then radio-tagged and tracked at night to find roost trees. Characteristics of cavity trees were documented and microhabitat variables such as number and condi- tion of snags, logs, and decadent trees within a 1-acre circle surrounding the cavity tree were also monitored. Logistic regression was used to identify what habitat var- iables influenced the selection of nest and roost sites by Pileated Woodpeckers. The results showed that Pileated Woodpeckers selected Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis) for nesting and selected against western hemlock. For roost trees, Pileated Woodpeckers selected western red cedar and again, selected against western hemlock. The authors also found that woodpeckers did not necessarily choose the largest dbh trees available, as was noted in previous studies of this species in the northwest (Bull 1987, Harestad and Keisker 1989, McClelland and McClelland 1999). They hypothesize that in forests with a wide range of tree sizes, Pileated Woodpeckers prefer medium size trees because very large trees may hinder their ability to detect nest predators, or the thick bark may make it difficult to detect the presence of heart rot fungus. The results also suggest that in this habitat, Pi- leated Woodpeckers preferred to nest in decadent trees rather than in snags. Roost trees averaged larger dbh than nest trees and roost cavities usually had more than one entrance. Nest and roost site characteristics showed high densities of large snags and decadent trees when compared to available sites at large, and also a higher diversity of tree species than available sites. The authors suggest that timber harvests should be selected so as to preserve large snags and decadent trees when found in a clumped configuration to best provide suitable habitat for Pileated Woodpeckers in coastal Washington.

Partial migration in Australian landbirds: a review. K. Chan. 2001. Emu 101:281-292.-Partial migration includes species in which some individuals are migratory (have a predictable seasonal movement from breeding grounds to wintering grounds and back in the same year) and others are not. The author, using the ornithological literature, attempted to determine the number of Australian species that have migratory and non-migratory populations, or have partially migratory populations. Most landbirds in Australia that migrate are intracontinental migrants. Latitudinal migration is probably quite common in Australian birds, and most major migration routes are roughly north-south, being constrained by the Great Dividing Range and the vast arid interior. The main water barrier to migration is Bass Strait that separates Tasmania from the mainland. Spe- cies with overlapping breeding and wintering grounds I (see also 25) are common, e.g., the Silvereye (Zosterops lateralis) where Tasmanian breeding birds winter with resident birds in the Sydney, New South Wales, area. Some species are diurnal migrants, some are nocturnal, and some are both. About 40% of Australian landbird species are mi- gratory and about 36% contain both sedentary and mi- gratory populations. About 32% of passerines are par- tially migratory. Honeyeaters and parrots have a sub- stantial number of migratory species, but most of these also exhibit nomadic and sedentary behavior. Some spe- cies have populations with both sedentary and migrant individuals, e.g., the Tasmanian population of Silvereyes. The authors suggest that for partial migration to persist in a population, climatic patterns or resource availability must be highly variable among years but not so extreme as to eliminate either the migratory or sedentary ele- ments. Some individuals of several species migrate in some years and not others, suggesting the possibility that many Australian migrants do not have as strict a 'mi- gratory clock' as it appears many species have elsewhere in the world. The various environmental instabilities that typify Australian habitats contribute to the variety and complexity of Australian bird movements. This pa- per might be of particular interest to those who nor- mally think about migration from a Northern Hemi- sphere perspective.

The signal from one transmitter was lost in October before the female departed the breeding grounds. During that time she used a home range of approximately 35 km2. The second female departed the breeding grounds 19 Oc- tober and flew WSW 1000 km to the wintering grounds in the southern Ukraine, near the cities of Cherson and Melitopol. She averaged about 250 km/day. In the spring she departed the wintering grounds 27 March and arrived on the breeding grounds on 5 April, aver- aging 125 km/day. The third female departed the breed- ing grounds 17 November and 4 days later was 400 km SW. She arrived on the wintering grounds 26 Novem- ber, averaging 125 km/day. She departed on her return trip 25 March and arrived on the breeding grounds 8 days later. However, she was stationary 26-28 March. Although expensive, satellite telemetry provides details on migratory movements of large birds that cannot be obtained any other way. The dates of migratory depar- ture and arrival, path taken, and stopover information are directly available and not inferred based on obser- vations.

Songbird nest predators in forest-pasture edge and forest interior in a fragmented land- scape. A.D. Chalfoun, M.J. Ratnaswamy, and F.R. Thompson III. 2002. Ecological Applications 12: 858- 867.-Nest predation is considered to be a major factor influencing avian population viability, and nest preda- tion pressure varies in relation to edge. The authors ex- amined the variation in nest predator and brood parasite distribution in forest-pasture edge sites and forest inte- rior sites. In 1998 and 1999 in the deciduous forests of central Missouri, the authors conducted avian, mam- malian, and snake surveys, as well as quantified vegeta- tion characteristics in the edge and interior plots. The authors found that Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) and corvids such as Blue Jays (Cyanocitta coerules- cens) and American Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) were more abundant at edges than forest interior sites. Small mammal abundance (primarily Peromyscus spp.) was higher in edge sites compared to interior sites in 1998 but more Peromyscus were found in interior sites the following year. Medium-sized mammalian predator abundance (i.e., raccoons [Procyon lotor]), striped skunks [Mephitis mephitis]) did not differ between edge and in- terior sites. Snake abundance was almost twice as high in edge sites as compared to interior sites. Forest char- acteristics were very similar between edge and interior sites, suggesting that the differences in predator abun- dances were not due to differences in forest structure. Predator communities differed between edge and inte- rior sites; although some predators may be more abun- dant near the edges of forest stands, this trend does not apply across all predator taxa. The authors suggest that the nature of the landscape matrix will likely contribute to differences in predator communities and that further studies examining how predators respond to fragmen- tation are needed to better understand the influence of edges on predators and threatened songbirds.

Survival rate of adult Barn Swallows Hirun- do rustica in relation to sexual selection and re- production. M0ller, A. P., and T. Szep. 2002. Ecology 83:2220-2228.-Sexually selected traits, such as body size or ornamentation, are often costly to produce and maintain. As a result, such traits should reduce the sur- vival rate of the sex that possesses them. Further, the degree to which survival rate declines should be inversely related to the degree of exaggeration of the sexually se- lected trait. However, empirical results often fail to de- tect a reduction in survival rate with the amount of ornamentation. The authors report results of a capture- mark-recapture study of Barn Swallows in Denmark in which they were able to partition survival effects from recapture probability effects. Over the entire study pe- riod (1984-1998), 1162 males and 1131 females were captured and used in the present analysis. At capture, 6 (see 8, 12, 13, 16, 21) 7 (see also 5, 6, 10, 12) several phenotypic traits were measured, but only tail length (measured as the average length [mm] of the out- ermost left and right rectrices) was used in the analysis. However, the authors report that, in addition to the length of the outer rectrices, symmetry in rectrix length is also positively related with female preference. As such, it would have been prudent to either correct average tail length to account for level of asymmetry or to include a measure of asymmetry in their analysis. Male and fe- male survival rates were not correlated through time, indicating that the factors affecting male and female sur- vival were different. Male tail length increased over the study period. Male survival decreased with increasing tail length in the previous year. Female tail length did not significantly increase or decrease over the study pe- riod. Female survival increased with increasing tail length, which was correlated with body mass and, there- fore, body condition. Overall survival rates of males and females did not differ significantly. The authors con- clude that tail length influences male and female survival differently, increasing female survival, but decreasing male survival.

Social and environmental factors affect na- tal dispersal and philopatry of male Red-cockaded Woodpeckers. Pasinelli, G., and J. R. Walters. 2002. Ecology 83: 2229-2239.-Dispersal is an important as- pect of a species' demography. Much research has been focused on the fitness consequences of variation in dis- persal behavior, but little research has been done on the factors affecting this variation. The authors report on their investigation into the causes of variation in natal dispersal using the Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) as a study species. This species is well suited for this type of question because it breeds cooperatively, with male offspring serving as nest helpers. Further, fledgling males vary with respect to their dispersal prob- ability, with some males staying in their natal territory as helpers and others dispersing to find their own ter- ritory. Lifetime reproductive success does not vary be- tween dispersers and philopatric males. Several hypoth- eses have been proposed to explain the difference between the groups. Among these hypotheses are the social-dominance, reproductive-competition, resource- competition, philopatric-benefit, ecological-constraint, density-dependence, and inheritance hypotheses. To test these hypotheses, the authors collected various data on 1437 male fledglings from 1281 broods. Three hundred and eight-two of the 1437 males dispersed in their first year, whereas the remaining 1055 remained as helpers. The authors' data provided support for the social-dom- inance, reproductive-competition, philopatric-benefits, and ecological-constraints hypotheses. Dispersing males had lower masses than philopatric males and had lower masses than their philopatric brood mates, lending sup- port to the social dominance hypothesis, because dom- inant males often grow faster and have a higher mass than their less-dominant siblings. The reproductive- competition hypothesis was supported by the fact that males were more likely to disperse if there were many male fledglings in their natal territory. The choice to</page><page sequence="6">J. Field Ornithol. 104 Recent Literature Winter 2003 become a helper did not depend on the number of help- ers at the nest. Dispersal was more likely if there were no high-quality territories within 1 km of the natal ter- ritory, but was no more likely to occur when there were no high-quality territories within 3.5 km (maximum dispersal distance), indicating a possible benefit to phil- opatry. Males also dispersed more often when there were vacant territories within 3.5 km of the natal territory, thus supporting the idea that there are ecological con- straints (i.e., lack of vacant territories to disperse into) limiting dispersal. The authors conclude that dispersal is a contingent behavior dependent on multiple factors. Remaining on the nest site as a helper is the favored strategy when a male is a dominant fledgling, when there are high-quality territories near-by, and when the natal territory is also high quality. Alternatively, it is a better strategy to disperse when a male is not socially dominant and is from a low-quality territory among many low-quality territories.

Population trend and reproduction of ur- ban Peregrine Falcons Falco peregrines in north- east Germany 1986-1999. [Bestandsentwicklung und Reproduktion der Gebaudebrutenden Wander- falken Falco p. peregrinus in Nordost-Deutsch- land im Zeitraum 1986-1999.] R. Altenkamp, P. Som- mer, G. Kleinstauber, and C. Saar. 2001. Vogelwelt 122: 329-339. (German, English and German summaries)- A release program with Peregrine Falcons was begun in 1977 in Berlin, with the first breeding pair recorded in 1986. Since then 12 pairs have been reported in urban areas of northeastern Germany. Between 1991-1999, the mean clutch size was 3.55 eggs and mean brood size was 2.56 young, smaller than the values reported for the species in western Germany and North America. The lower comparative values are likely the result of the use of DDT in eastern Germany until the mid-1980s. Nine- ty young hatched from 33 nests under observation and produced 82 fledglings (91%). The causes of mortality were Trichomoniasis and falling from the nest. Twenty- three of 67 fledglings (34%) are thought to have died during the first 4 weeks after fledging. The causes of mortality included aspergillosis, collisions with struc- tures, and smoke inhalation. [Fehmarnerstr. 18, D- 13353 Berlin, German; Email: R.Altenkamp@web. de]-Robert C. Beason. 20. Population viability of Piping Plovers: ef- fects of predator exclusion. Larson, M. A., M. R. Ryan, and R. K. Murphy. 2002. Journal of Wildlife Management 66(2): 361-371.-The Great Plains pop- ulation of Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) was listed as threatened under the United States Endangered Spe- cies Act in 1985. Population viability analysis (PVA) models (Ryan et al. 1993, Plissner and Haig 2000), de- signed to determine what variables have the greatest af- fect on Piping Plover populations, suggested that adult survivorship had the greatest affect on population 8 (see also 11, 25) growth rate. These models did not, however, allow for variation in fledging rates in the two common habitats used by Piping Plovers for nesting, alkali flats around lakes, and sand and gravel bars in rivers. On the alkali flats, predators caused the largest portion of infant mor- tality, but on the isolated sand bars, human caused fluc- tuations in the water level caused most nest failures. The purpose of this paper was to reevaluate the reproductive success and growth rates of the Great Plains population of Piping Plovers, and to revise the PVA models to in- clude more recent and accurate estimates of adult sur- vivorship rates. In addition, the authors sought to com- pare the infant mortality rates in the two habitats. The authors sought unpublished data on Piping Plover re- productive success to supplement the published data in order to derive the most current adult survivorship rates. They found that Piping Plovers nesting on alkali flats had a higher nesting success rate (0.89 fledglings/pair) than those nesting on river sand bars (0.73 fledglings/ pair). The reproductive success rates were as high as 2.25 fledglings/pair when predator exclusion methods such as nest cages and permanent electric fences were used. The results of the updated PVA models were more optimistic than those from Ryan et al. (1993) and Plissner and Haig (2000), but still showed a baseline, 6.2% annual population decline. If approximately 360 nests are pro- tected a year, the rate of decline, according to this mod- el, could be lowered to 2.8% per year. The authors sug- gest that more nests must be protected from predators, or if success rates for Piping Plovers nesting on major river systems increased by better management of water levels, then predator exclusion would not be as necessary at the alkali flats habitats.

ZOOGEOGRAPHY AND DISTRIBUTION9 WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY10 21. Postdevelopment experiments to detect an- thropogenic disturbances: the case of sea ducks and wind parks. M. Guillemette and J.K. Larsen. 2002. Ecological Applications 12: 868-877.-Ecologi- cal Impact Assessments (EIAs) are typically conducted under time constraints, and it has been suggested that "postdevelopment" investigations might be a partial complement to problems associated with Before-After- Control-Impact (BACI) EIAs. The authors examined the effects of a wind park on the abundance, distribu- tion, and behavior of the Common Eider (Somateria mo/lissima), since turbines might negatively affect prey abundance of Common Eiders. The wind park consisted of 10,500-kW turbines arranged in two rows in waters that were 3-5 m deep. During the winter of 1996- 1997, the authors conducted three separate experiments to examine the effect of turbines on Common Eiders. First, the authors examined Common Eider distribution in relation to turbine activity and found that the distri- bution of birds did not differ between areas surrounding 9 (see 25) 10 (see also 12, 13, 20)</page><page sequence="7">Vol. 74, No. 1 Recent Literature 105 operating turbines and areas surrounding stopped tur- bines. Secondly, the authors examined food abundance as it related to Common Eider abundance and turbine location. Common Eiders closely tracked the abundance of bivalves, and foraging was not negatively affected by the turbines. Finally, wind parks have the potential to disrupt sea duck activity due to potential bird collisions with turbine blades. Birds seemed to avoid flying and landing within 100 m of the wind park, but flying and landing were not affected at greater distances from the turbines. Common Eiders differ in flock structure from many other birds that might be affected by wind tur- bines, and the authors caution against extrapolation of these results to other species. Additionally, the authors note that the study is limited both in spatial and tem- poral scope. However, the authors suggest that "post- development" experiments have value in determining the magnitude and scope of potential impacts, and that these experiments are useful complements to BACI stud- ies.

Vier- ling. 22. Veterinary conservation biology. H. F. Recher. 2001. Pacific Conservation Biology 7:77-78.- In this editorial, Recher begins by presenting his positive impressions of a symposium on "Wildlife Health and Management in Australasia" organized by a number of veterinary associations including the Australian Associ- ation of Veterinary Conservation Biologists, at the Tar- onga Zoo, Sydney, in July 2001. The bulk of the edi- torial, however, deals with animal welfare groups, their philosophy, and the difficulties they present, directly and indirectly, to research biologists. Recher suggests that the message from the animal welfare groups at the sympo- sium was simplistic, anthropomorphic, and clearly placed the rights of the individual above those of the population or species, e.g., it is "cruel and inhumane" to control feral cats and foxes regardless of their impact on species of native fauna. Recher strongly maintains that the survival of species must take precedence over the rights and welfare of individuals. Recher then turns attention to ethics committees whose approval is re- quired for teaching and research protocols. Committee approval has been extended to observational studies of wild animals and increasingly committees make de- mands that are difficult or impossible to comply with, despite the apparent lack of experience in the study of wild animals in many committees. Recher maintains that teaching zoology has been impaired by constraints imposed by animal welfare groups and ethics commit- tees, and makes the strong statement: "It has been sug- gested to me that this is precisely the outcome that some members of the ethics committees are seeking to achieve; placing the welfare of the individual animal above all other consideration. I find this unethical in the extreme and wonder if ethics committees should not themselves require ethics approval before convening." He suggests further that from listening to representatives of animal welfare groups he infers that all research in- volving animals is likely to be considered "unethical." Recher maintains that scientists doing research on wild animals care deeply about the welfare of the individuals they study, and their research should not be hindered or prevented by those that would let species become extinct to protect the welfare of individual animals. He con- cludes that if there is a need to regulate research on fauna then that regulation should come from within the scientific community, not from the outside. This is a provocative and hard-hitting editorial that should be of interest to anyone who has, or may, interact with an ethics committee or animal welfare groups.

Pacific Conservation Biology 7:152-153.-In this edi- torial, the authors discuss the conflict between animal welfare that deals with the rights of individual animals and conservation that deals primarily with populations and species. They describe their own research project that involved culling native Pied Currawongs (Strepera graculina) that are know nest predators of smaller native bird species, to test for lowered predation rates on arti- ficial nests. They had secured approval, license, and a small grant for their protocol from New South Wales (NSW) National Parks and Wildlife Service, and ap- proval of the New England Animal Ethics Committee (AEC). However, the day before the culling was to take place, the AEC requested postponement of the culling because the Animal Research Review Panel of NSW Ag- riculture had received a complaint. Permission to pro- ceed with the experiment was eventually granted, but the delay introduced substantial problems into the ex- perimental design and conduct of the procedure. The authors argue that the experiment was postponed: "in the absence of reasonable scientific or thoughtful ethical justification." They further argue that Animal Ethics Committees and legislation are historically principally concerned with domestic and laboratory animals, while conservation legislation primarily deals with protection of native species in the wild. Further, if all animals are granted the same rights without consideration of poten- tial deleterious effects on other species, then, the authors conclude, we are ignoring responsibility for more vul- nerable species and biodiversity in general. The authors conclude by suggesting the establishment of a single committee on research of native species, probably as part of a governmental agency, to consider both animal wel- fare and conservation. This editorial should be of inter- est to anyone dealing with animal ethics committees.

The Pied Currawong's role in avian nest predation: a predator removal experiment. G. R. Fulton and H. A. Ford. 2001. Pacific Conservation Bi- ology 7:154-160.-Pied Currawongs (Strepera graculi- na) have increased dramatically in recent decades in east- ern Australia, are significant nest predators during the currawong nesting cycle, and may threaten the viability of local small passerine populations. The authors report on an experimental procedure that compared predation rates on artificial nests in an experimental plot before and after culling of resident nesting currawongs, and with a control plot. One hundred and four nests were</page><page sequence="8">J. Field Ornithol. 106 Recent Literature Winter 2003 placed in the two plots, within which, and around which, Pied Currawongs were nesting. In the pre-cull week 91% of nests were predated. In one corner of the control plot where no currawongs nested, 15 of 16 nests survived. There was significant decline in predation in the experimental plot after culling, but not in the con- trol plot. The authors suggest that their experiment, which had been delayed by their Animal Ethics Com- mittee, may have underestimated the impact of curra- wong predation, since several currawong broods had fledged, were observed roaming the experimental plot, and hence were probably predating nests. The authors suggest that culling currawongs may lead to a doubling or better of nesting success in resident small passerines, and hence controlling currawong numbers could have a profound effect on the survival of woodland bird species in fragmented landscapes. They further suggest that a long term solution for controlling currawong numbers may be to remove exotic berry-producing shrubs and trees that sustain currawongs in winter, and to protect small passerines by planting endemic shrubs and pro- moting regeneration.
