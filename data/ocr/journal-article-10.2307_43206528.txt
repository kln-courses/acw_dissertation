<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PRINCIPLES OF A LIBERAL SOCIAL ORDER by F.A. Hayek (*) 1. By « liberalism » I shall understand here the conception of a de- sirable political order which in the first instance was developed in En- gland from the time of the Old Whigs in the later part of the seven- teenth century to that of Gladstone at the end of the nineteenth. As its typical representatives in England may be regarded David Hume, Adam Smith, Edmund Burke, T.B. Macaulay and Lord Acton. It was this conception of individual liberty under the law which in the first in- stance inspired the liberal movements on the Continent and which became the basis of the American political tradition. A few of the leading political thinkers in those countries like B. Constant and A. de Tocqueville in France, I. Kant, Friedrich von Schiller and Wilhelm von Humboldt in Germany, and James Madison, John Marshall and Daniel Webster in the United States belong wholly to it. 2. This liberalism must be clearly distinguished from another, pe- culiarly Continental European tradition also called « liberalism » of which what now claims this name in the United States is a direct descendant. This latter view, though beginning with an attempt to imi- tate the first tradition, interpreted it in the spirit of a constructivist ra- tionalism prevalent in France and thereby made of it something very different, and in the end, instead of advocating limitations on the powers of government, ended up with the ideal of the unlimited powers of the majority. This is the tradition of Voltaire, Rousseau, Condor- cet and the French Revolution which became the ancestors of modern socialism. English utilitarianism has taken over much of this Continen- tal tradition and the late nineteenth century English liberal party, resulting from a fusion of the liberal Whigs and the utilitarian Radi- cals, was also a product of this mixture. 3. Liberalism and democracy, although compatible, are not the same. The first is concerned with the extent of governmental power, the second with who holds this power. The difference is best seen if we consider their opposites: the opposite of liberalism is totalitarianism, while the opposite of democracy is authoritarianism. In consequence, it is at least possible in principle that a democratic government may be totalitarian and that an authoritarian government act on liberal princi- ples. The second kind of «liberalism» mentioned before has in effect become democratism rather than liberalism, and demanding unlimited power of the majority, has become essentially anti-liberal. 4. It should be specially emphasized that the two political philo- sophies which both describe themselves as « liberalism » and lead in a (*) Volkswirtschaftliches Seminar der Universität, Freiburg i. Br. - 601</page><page sequence="2">few respects to similar conclusions, rest on altogether different philo- sophical foundations. The first is based on an evolutionary interpreta- tion of all phenomena of culture and mind and on an insight into the limits of the powers of the human reason. The second rests on what I have called « constructivist » rationalism, a conception which leads to the treatment of all cultural phenomena as the product of deliberate design, and on the belief that it is both possible and desirable to re- construct all grown institutions in accordance with a preconceived plan. The first kind is consequently reverent of tradition and recognizes that all knowledge and all civilization rests on tradition, while the second type is contemptuous of tradition because it regards an indepen- dently existing reason as capable of designing civilization. (Cf. the sta- tement by Voltaire: «If you want good laws, burn those you have and make new ones »). The first is also an essentially modest creed, relying on abstraction as the only available means for extending the limited powers of reason, while the second refuses to recognize any such limits and believes that reason alone can prove the desirability of particular concrete arrangements. (It is a result of this difference that the first kind of liberalism is at least not incompatible with religious beliefs and has often been held and even been developed by men holding strong religious beliefs, while the « Continental » type of liberalism has always been antagonistic to all religions and politically been in constant conflict with organized re- ligions). 5. The first kind of liberalism, which we shall henceforth alone consider, is itself not the result of a theoretical construction but arose from the desire to extend and generalise the beneficial effects which unexpectedly had followed on the limitations placed on the powers of government out of sheer distrust of the rulers. Only after it was found that the unquestioned greater personal liberty which the Englishman enjoyed in the 18th century had produced an unprecedented material prosperity were attempts made to develop a systematic theory of libe- realism, attempts which in England never were carried very far while the Continental interpretations largely changed the meaning of the English tradition. 6. Liberalism thus derives from the discovery of a self-generating or spontaneous order in social affairs (the same discovery which led to the recognition that there existed an object for theoretical social scien- ces), an order which made it possible to utilize the knowledge and skill of all members of society to a much greater extent than would be possible in any order created by central direction, and the consequent desire to make as full use of these powerful spontaneous ordering for- ces as is possible. 7. It was thus in their efforts to make explicit the principles of an order already existing but only in an imperfect form that Adam Smith and his followers developed the basic principles of liberalism in order to 602 -</page><page sequence="3">demonstrate the desirability of their general application. In doing this they were able to presuppose familiarity with the common law con- ception of justice and with the ideals of the rule of law and of go- vernment under the law which were little understood outside the Anglo- saxon world; with the result that not only were their ideas not fully understood outside the English-speaking countries, but that they ceased to be fully understood even in England when Bentham and his followers replaced the English legal tradition by a constructivist utilitarianism derived more from Continental rationalism than from the evolutionary conception of the English tradition. 8. The central concept of liberalism is that under the enforcement of universal rules of just conduct, protecting a recognizable private domains of the individuals, a spontaneous order of human activities of much greater complexity will form itself than could ever be produced by deliberate arrangement, and that in consequence the coercive activities of government should be limited to the enforcement of such rules, wha- tever other services government may at the same time render by ad- ministering those particular resources which have been placed at its disposal for those purposes. 9. The distinction between a spontaneous order based on abstract rules which leave the individuals free to use their knowledge for their own purposes, and an organisation or arrangement based on commands, is of central importance for the understanding of the principles of a free society and must in the following paragraphs be explained in some detail, especially as the spontaneous order of a free society will contain many organisations (including the biggest organisation, government), but the two principles of order cannot be mixed in any manner we may wish. 10. The first peculiarity of a spontaneous order is that by using its ordering forces (the regularity of the conduct of its members) we can achieve an order of a much more complex set of facts than we could ever by deliberate arrangement, but that, while availing ourselves of this possibility of inducing an order of much greater extent than we otherwise could, we at the same time limit our power over the details of that order. We shall say that using the former principle we shall have power only over the abstract character but not over the concrete detail of that order. 11. No less important is the fact that, in contrast to an organi- sation, a spontaneous order neither has a purpose nor need there be agreement on the concrete results it will produce in order to agree on the desirability of such an order, because, being independent of any particular purpose, it can be used, and will assist in the pursuit of, a great many different, divergent and even conflicting individual pur- poses. The order of the market, in particular, rets thus not on common - 603</page><page sequence="4">purposes but on reciprocity, that is on the reconciliation of different purposes for the mutual benefit of the participants. 12. The conception of the common welfare or of the public good of a free society can therefore never be defined as a sum of known par- ticular results to be achieved, but only as an abstract order which as a whole is not oriented on any particular concrete ends but provides me- rely the best chance for any member selected at random successfully to use his knowledge for his purposes. Adopting a term of Professor Michael Oakeshott (London), we may call such a free society a nomo- cratic (law-governed) as distinguished from an unfree telocratic (pur- pose-governed) social order. 13. The great importance of the spontaneous order or nomocracy rests on the fact that it extends the possibility of peaceful coexistence of men for their mutual benefit beyond the small group whose members have concrete common purposes, or are subject to a common superior, and that it thus made the appearance of the Great or Open Society possible. This order which progressively grew beyond the organisations of the family, the horde, the clan and the tribe, the principalities and even the empire or national state, and has produced at least the be- ginnings of a world society, is based on the adoption - without and often against the desire of political authority - of rules which came to prevail because the groups who observed them were more successful; and it has existed and grown in extent long before men were aware of its existence or understood its operation. 14. The spontaneous order of the market, based on reciprocity or mutual benefits, is commonly described as an economic order ; and in the vulgar sense of the term «economic» the Great Society is indeed held together entirely by what are commonly called economic forces. But is is exceedingly misleading, and has become one of the chief sources of confusion and misunderstanding, to call this order one economy as we do when we speak of a national, social, or world economy. This is at least one of the chief sources of most socialist endeavour to turn the spontaneous order of the market into a deliberately run organisation serving an agreed system of common ends. 15. An economy in the strict sense of the word in which we can call a household, a farm, an enterprise or even the financial administra- tion of government, one economy, is indeed an organisation or a deli- berate arrangement of a given stock of resources in the service of a unitary order of purposes. It rests on a system of coherent decisions in which a single view of the relative importance of the different com- peting purposes determines the uses to be made of the different resources. 16. The spontaneous order of the market resulting from the inter- action of many such economies is something so fundamentally different from an economy proper that it must be regarded as a great misfortune 604 -</page><page sequence="5">that it is has ever been called by the same name. I have become con- vinced that this practice so constantly misleads people that it is neces- sary to invent a new technical term for it. I propose that we call this spontaneous order of the market a catallaœy in analogy to the term « catallactis », which has often been proposed as a substitute for the name « economics ». (Both « catallaxy » and « catallactis » derive from the ancient Greek verb katallattein which, significantly, means not only « to barter » and « to exchange » but also « to admit into the community » and « to turn from enemy into friend »). 17. The chief point about the catallaxy is that, as a spontaneous order, its orderliness does not rest on its orièntation on a single hierar- chy of ends, and that, therefore, it will not secure that for it as a whole the more important comes before the less important. This is the chief cause of its condemnation by its opponents, and it could be said that most of the socialist demands amount to nothing less than that the ca- tallaxy should be turned into an economy proper (i.e. the purposeless spontaneous order into a purpose-oriented organisation) in order to assure that the more important be never sacrificed to the less important. The defence of the free society must therefore show that it is due to the fact that we do not enforce a unitary scale of concrete ends, and do not attempt to secure that some particular view about what is more and what is less important governs the whole of society, that the members of such a free society have as good a chance successfully to use their individual knowledge for the achievement of their individual purpose as they in fact have. 18. The extension of an order of peace beyond the small purpose- oriented organisation became thus possible by the extension of purpose- independent (« formal ») rules of just conduct to the relations with other men who did not pursue the same concrete ends or hold the same values except those abstract rules - rules which did not impose obligations for particular actions (which always presuppose a concrete end) but con- sisted solely in prohibitions to infringe the protected domain of each which these rules enable us to determine. Liberalism is therefore inse- parable from the institution of private property which is the name we usually give to the material part of this protected individual domain. 19. But if liberalism presupposes the enforcement of rules of just conduct and expects a desirable spontaneous order to form itself only if appropriate rules of just conduct are in fact observed, it also wants to restrict the coercive powers of government to the enforcement of such rules of just conduct, including at least one prescribing a positive duty namely the rule requiring citizens to contribute according to uniform principles not only to the cost of enforcing those rules but also to the costs of the non-coercive service functions of government which we shall presently consider. Liberalism is therefore the same as the de- mand for the rule of law in the classical sense of the term according to which the coercive functions of government are strictly limited to - 605</page><page sequence="6">the enforcement of uniform rules of law, meaning uniform rules of just conduct toward's one's fellow. (The « rule of law » corresponds here to what in German is called materieller Rechtsstaat as distinguished from the mere formale Rechtsstaat which requires only that each act of government is authorized by legislation, whether such a law consists of a general rule of just conduct or not). 20. Liberalism recognizes that there are certain other services which for various reasons the spontaneous forces of the market may not pro- duce or may not produce adequately, and that for this reason it is desirable to put at the disposal of government a clearly circumscribed body of resources with which it can render such services to the citizens in general. This requires a sharp distinction between the coercive powers of government, in wMch its actions are strictly limited to the enforcement of rules of just conduct and in the exercise of which all discretion is excluded, and the provision of services by government, for which it can use only the resources put at its disposal for this purpose, has no coercive power or monopoly, but in the use of which resources it enjoys wide discretion. 21. It is significant that such a conception of a liberal order has arisen only in countries in which, in ancient Greece and Eome no less than in modern Britain, justice was conceived as something to be discovered by the efforts of judges or scholars and not as determined by the arbitrary will of any authority; that it always had difficulty in taking roots in countries in which law was conceived primarily as the product of deliberate legislation, and that it has everywhere declined under the joint influence of legal positivism and of democratic doctrine, both of which know no other criterium of justice than the will of the legislator. 22. Liberalism has indeed inherited from the theories of the com- mon law and from the older (pre- rationalist) theories of the law of nature, and also presupposes, a conception of justice which allows us to distinguish between such rules of just individual conduct as are implied in the conception of the « rule of law », and are required for the formation of a spontaneous order on the one hand, and all the particular commands issued by authorithy for the purpose of organisation on the other. This essential distinction has been made explicit in the legal theories of two of the greatest philosophers of modern times, David Hume and Immanuel Kant, but has not been adequately restated since and is wholly uncongenial to the now governing legal theories. 23. The essential points of this conception of justice are (a) that justice can be meaningfully attributed only to human action and not to any state of affairs as such without reference to the question whether it has been, or could have been, deliberately brought about by some- body; (b) that the rules of justice have essentially the nature of prohi- bitions, or, in other words, that injustice is really the primary concept 606 -</page><page sequence="7">and the aim of rules of just conduct is to prevent unjust action; (c) that the injustice to be prevented is the infringement of the protected domain of one*s fellow men, a domain which is to be ascertained by means of these rule of justice; and (d) that these rules of just conduct which are in themselves negative can be developed by consistently ap- plying to whatever such rules a society has inherited the equally ne- gative test of universal applicability - a test which, in the last resort is nothing else than the self-consistency of the actions which these rules allow if applied to the circumstances of the real world. These four crucial points must be developed further in the following paragraphs. 24. Ad (a): Rules of just conduct can require the individual to take into account in his decisions only such consequences of his actions as he himself can foresee. The concrete results of the catallaxy for particular people are, however, essentially unpredictable; and since they are not the effect of anyone's design or intentions, it is meaningless to describe the manner in which the market distributed the good things of this world among particular people as just or unjust. This, however, is what the so-called « social » or « distributive » justice aims at and in the name of which the liberal order of law is progressively destroyed. We shall later see that no test or criteria have been found or can be found by which such rules of « social justice » can be assessed, and that, in consequence, and in contrast to the rules of just conduct, they would have to be determined by the arbitrary will of the holders of power. 25. Ad (b): No particular human action is fully determined wi- thout a concrete purpose it is meant to achieve. Free men who are to be allowed to use their own means and their own knowledge for their own purposes must therefore not be subject to rules which tell them what they must positively do, but only to rules which tell them what they must not do; except for the discharge of obligations an individual has voluntarily incurred, the rules of just conduct thus merely delimit the range of permissible actions but do not détermine the particular actions a man must take at a particular moment. (There are certain rare exceptions to this, like action to save or protect life, prevent catastro- phes, and the like, where either rules of justice actually do require, or would at least generally be accepted as just rules, if they required some positive action. It would lead far to discuss here the position of such rules in the system). The generally negative character of the rules of just conduct, and the corresponding primacy of the injustice which is prohibited, has often been noticed but scarcely ever been thought through to its logical consequences. 26. Ad (c): The injustice which is prohibited by rules of just con- duct is any encroachment on the protected domain of other individuals, and they must therefore enable us to ascertain what is the protected sphere of others. Since the time of John Locke it is customary to describe this protected domain as property (which Locke himself had defined as « the life, liberty, and possession of a man »). This term - 607</page><page sequence="8">suggest, however, a much too narrow and purely material conception of the protected domain which includes not only material goods but also various claims on others and certain expectations. If the concept of property is however (with Locke) interpreted in this wide sense, it is true that law in the sense of rules of justice and the institution of property are inseparable. 27. Ad (d): It is impossible to decide about the justice of any one particular rule of just conduct except within the framework of a whole system of such rules, most of which must for this purpose be regarded as unquestioned: values can always be tested only in terms of other values. The test of the justice of a rule is usually (since Kant) described as that of its « universalis ability », i.e. of the possibility of willing that the rules should be applied to all instances that correspond to the condi- tions stated in it (the « categorical imperative »). What this amounts to is that in applying it to any concrete circumstances it will not conflict with any other accepted rules. The test is thus in the last resort one of the compatibility or non-contradictoriness of the whole system of rules, not merely in a logical sense but in the sense that the system of actions which the rules permit will not lead to conflict. 28. It will be noticed that only purpose-independent («formal») rules will pass this test because, as rules which have originally been developed in, small, purposje-connected groups (« organisations ») are progressively extended to larger and larger groups and finally uni- versalized to apply to the relations between any members of an open society who have no concrete purposes in common and merely submit to same abstract rules, they will in this process have to shed all references to particular purposes. 29. The growth from the tribal organisation, all of whose members, served common purposes, to the spontaneous order of the Open Society in which people are allowed to pursue their own purposes in peace, may thus be said to have commenced when for the first time a savage placed some goods at the boundary of his tribe in the hope that some member of another tribe would find them and leave in turn behind some other goods to secure the repetition of the offer. From the first establishment of such a practice which served reciprocal but not common purposes, a process has been going on for millenia which, by making rules of con- duct independent of the particular purposes of those concerned, made it possible to extend these rules to ever wider circles of undetermined persons and eventually might make possible a universal peaceful order of the world. 30. The character of those universal rules of just individual con- duct, which liberalism presupposes and wishes to improve as much as possible, has been obscured by confusion with that other part of law which determines the organisation of government and guides it in the administration of the resources placed at its disposal. It is a charac- 608 -</page><page sequence="9">teristic of liberal society that tlie private individual can be coerced to obey only the rules of private and criminal law; and the progressive permeation of private law by public law in the course of the last eighty or hundred years, which means a progressive replacement of rules of conduct by rules of organisation, is one of the main ways in which the destruction of the liberal order has been effected. A German scholar (Franz Böhm) has for this reason recently described the liberal order very justly as the Privatrechtsgesellschaft (private law society). 31. The difference between the order at which the rules of conduct of private and criminal law aim, and the order at which the rules of organisation of public law aim, comes out most clearly if we consider that rules of conduct will determine an order of action only in com- bination with the particular knowledge and aims of the acting indivi- duals while the rules of organisation of public law determine directly such concrete action in the light of particular purposes, or, rather, give some authority power to do so. The confusion between rules of conduct and rules of organisation has been assisted by an erroneous identification of what is often called the « order of law » with the order of actions, which in a free system is not fully determined by the system of laws but merely presupposes such a system of laws as one of the conditions required for its formation. Not every system of rules of conduct which secures uniformity of action (which is how the « order of law » is fre- quently interpreted) will however secure an order of actions in the sense that the actions permitted by the rules will not conflict. 32. The progressive displacement of the rules of conduct of private amd criminal law by conceptions derived from public law is the process by which existing liberal societies are progressively transformed into totalitarian societies. This tendency has been most explicitly seen and supported by Adolf Hitler's « crown jurist » Carl Schmitt who con- sistently advocated the replacement of the « normative » thinking of liberal law by a conception of law which regards as its purpose the «-concrete order formation» (konkretes Ordnung s denken). 33. Historically this development has become possible as a result of the fact that the same representative assemblies have been charged with the two different tasks of laying down rules of individuals conduct and laying down rules and giving orders concerning the organisation and conduct of government. The consequence of this has been that the term « law » itself, which in the older conception of the « rule of law » had meant only rules of conduct equally applicable to all, came to mean any rule of organisation or even any particular command approved by the constitutionally appointed legislature. Such a conception of the rule of law which merely demands that a command be legitimately issued and not that it be a rule of justice equally applicable to all (what the Germans call the merely formale Rechtsstaat), of course no longer provides any protection of individual freedom. - 609</page><page sequence="10">34. If it was the nature of the constitutional arrangements prevail- ing in all Western democracies which made this development possible, the driving force which guided it in the particular direction was the growing recognition that the application of uniform or equal rules to the conduct of individuals who were in fact very different in many respects, inevitably produced very different results for the different individuals; and that in order to bring about by government action a reduction in these unin- tended but inevitable differences in the material position of different people, it would be necessary to treat them not according to the same but according to different rules. This gave rise to a new and altogether different conception of justice, namely that usually described as « social » or « distributive » justice - a conception of justice which did not confine itself to rules of conduct for the individual, but aimed at particular results for particular people and which therefore could be achieved only in a purpose-governed organisation but not in a purpose-independent spontaneous order. 35. The concepts of a «just price», a «just remuneration» or a «just distribution of incomes » are of course very old; it deserves notice, however, that in the course of the efforts of two-thousand years in which philosophers have speculated about the meaning of these concepts, not a single rule has been discovered which would allow us to determine what is in this sense just in a market order. Indeed the one group of scholars which have most persistently pursued the question, the school- men of the later middle ages and early modern times, were finally driven to define the just price or wage as that price or wage which would form itself on a market in the absence of fraud, violence or pri- vilege - thus referring back to the rules of just conduct and accepting as a just result whatever was brought about by the just conduct of all individuals concerned. This negative conclusion of all the speculations about « social » or « distributive » justice was, as we shall see, inevitable, because a just remuneration or distribution has meaning only within an organisation whose members act under command in the service of a common system of ends, but can have no meaning whatever in a catallaxy or spontaneous order which can have no such common system of ends. 36. A state of affairs as such, as we have seen, cannot be just or unjust as a mere fact. Only in so far as it has been brought about designedly, or could be so brought about, does it make sense to call just or unjust the actions of those who have created it or permitted it to arise. In the catallaxy, the spontaneous order of the market, nobody can foresee, however, what each participant will get, and the results for particular people are not determined by anyone's intentions; nor is anyone responsible for particular people getting particular things. We might therefore question whether a deliberate choice of the market order as the method for guiding economic activities, with its impredictable and in a great measure accidental incidents of its benefits, is a just decision; but certainly not whether, once we have decided to avail our- 610 -</page><page sequence="11">selves of the catallaxy for that purpose, the particular results it pro- duces for particular people are just or unjust. 37. That the concept of justice is nevertheless so commonly and readily applied to the distribution of incomes is entirely the effect of an erroneous anthropomorphic interpretation of society as an orga- nisation rather than as a spontaneous order. The term «distribution» is in this sense quite as misleading as the term «economy», since it also suggests that something is the result of deliberate action which in facts is the result of spontaneous ordering forces. Nobody distributes income in a market order (as would have to be done in an organisation) and to speak with respect to the former of a just or unjust distribution is therefore just nonsense. It would be less misleading to speak in this respect of a « dispersion » rather than a « distribution » of incomes. 38. All endeavours to secure a «just» distribution must thus be directed towards turning the spontaneous order of the market into an organisation or, in other words, into a totalitarian order. It was this striving after a new conception of justice which produced the various steps by which rules of organisation («public law»), which were designed to make people aim at particular result came to supersede the purpose-independent rules of just individual conduct, and which thereby gradually destroyed the foundations on which a spontaneous order must rest. 39. The ideal of using the coercive powers of government to achieve «positive» (i.e. social or distributive) justice leads, however, not only necessarily to the destruction of individual freedom, which some might not think too high a price, but it also proves on examination a mirage or an illusion which cannot be achieved in any circumstances, because it presupposes an agreement on the relative importance of the different concrete ends which cannot exist in a great society whose members do not know each other or the same particular facts. It is sometimes believed that the fact that most people today desire social justice de- monstrates that this ideal has a determinable content. But it is un- fortunately only too possible to chase a mirage, and the consequence of this is always that the result of one's striving will be utterly different from what one had intended. 40. There can be no rules which determine how much everybody « ought » to have unless we make some unitary conception of relative « merits » or « needs » of the different individuals, for wich there exists no objective measure, the basis of a central allocation of all goods and services - which would make it necessary that each individual, instead of using his knowledge for his purposes, were made to fulfil a duty imposed upon him by somebody else, and were remunerated according to how well he has, in the opinion of others, performed this duty. This is the method of remuneration appropriate to a closed organisation, such as an army, but irreconcilable with the forces which maintain a spontaneous order. - 611</page><page sequence="12">41. It ought to be freely admitted that the market order does not bring about any close correspondence between subjective merit or individual needs and rewards. It operates on the principle of a com- bined game of skill and chance in which the results for each individual may be as much determined by circumstances wholly beyond his control as by his skill or effort. Each is remunerated according to the value his particular services have to tļlie particular people to whom he renders them, and this value of his services stands in no necessary relation to anything wich we could appropriately call his merits, and still less to his needs. 42. It deserves special emphasis that, strictly speaking, it is mean- ingless to speak of a value « to society » when what is in question is the value of some services to certain people, services which may be of no interest to anybody else. A violin virtuoso presumably renders services to entirely different people from those whom a football star entertains, and the maker of pipes altogether different people from the maker of perfumes. The whole conception of a « value to society » is in a free order as illegitimate an anitrophomorphic term as its description as « one economy » in the strict sense, as an entity which « treats » people justly or unjustly, or « distributes » among them. The results of the market process for particular individuals is neither the result of anybody's will that they should have so much, nor even foreseeable by those who have decided upon or support the maintenance of this kind of order. 43. Of all the complaints about the injustice of the results of the market order the one which appears to have had the greatest effect on actual policy, and to have produced a progressive destruction of the equal rules of just conduct and their replacement by a « social » law aiming at « social justice », however, was not the extent of the inequality of the rewards, nor their disproportion with recognizable merits, needs, efforts, pains incurred, or whatever else has been chiefly stressed by social philosophers, but the demands for protection against an undeser- ved descent from an already achieved position. More than by anything else the market order has been distorted by efforts to protect groups from a decline from their former position; and when government interference is demanded in the name of « social justice » this now means, more often than not, the demand for the protection of the existing relative posi- tion of some group. « Social justice » has thus become little more than a demand for the protection of vested interests and the creation of new privilege such as when in the name of social justice the farmer is assured « parity » with the industrial worker. 44. The important facts to be stressed here are that the positions thus protected were the result of the same sort of forces as those which now reduce the relative position of the same pleople, that their position for which they now demand protection was no more deserved or earned than the diminished position now in prospect for them, and that their 612 -</page><page sequence="13">former positions could in the changed position be secured to them only by denying to others the same chances of ascent to which they owed their former position. In a market order the fact that a group of persons has achieved a certain relative position cannot give them a claim in justice to maintain it, because this cannot be defended by a rule which could be equally applied to all. 45. The aim of economic policy of a free society can therefore never be to assure particular results to particular people, and its success cannot be measured by any attempt of adding up the value of such par- ticular results. In this respect the aims of what is called « welfare eco- nomics » are fundamentally mistaken, not only because no meaningful sum of the satisfactions provided for different people can be formed, but because its basic idea of a maximum of need-fulfilment (or a maximum social product) is appropriate only to an economy proper which serves a single hierarchy of ends, but not to the spontaneous order of a ca- tallaxy which has no common concrete ends. 46. Though it is widely believed that the conception of an optimal economic policy (or any judgement whether one economic policy is bet- ter than another) presupposes such a conception of maximizing aggre- gate real social income (which is possible only in value terms and there- fore implies an illegitimate comparison of the utility to different per- sons), this is in fact not so. An optimal policy in a catallaxy may aim, and ought to aim, at increasing the chances of any member of society taken at random to have a high income, or, what amounts to the same thing, the chance that, whatever his share in total income may be, the real equivalent of this share will be as large as we know to make it. 47. This condition will be approached as closely as we can bring this about, irrespective of the dispersion of incomes, if everything which is produced is being produced by persons or organisations who can pro- duce it cheaper (or at least as cheaply) as anybody who does not pro- duce it, and sold at a price lower than that at which it would be possible to offer it for anybody who does not in fact so offer it. (This allows for persons or organisations to whom the cost of producing one commo- dity or service are lower than they are for those who actually produce it and who still produce something else instead, because their com- parative advantage in that other production is still greater; in this case total costs of their producing the first commodity would have to include the loss of the one which is not produced). 48. It will be noticed that this optimum does not presuppose what economic theory calls « perfect competition » but only that there are no obstacles to the entry into each trade and that the market functions adequately in spreading information about opportunities. It should also be specially observed that this modest and achievable goal has never yet been fully achieved because at all times and everywhere go- vernments have both restricted the access to some occupations and tole- - 013</page><page sequence="14">rated persons and organisations deterring others from entering occupa- tions when this would have been to the advantage of the latter. 49. This optimum position means that of whatever combination of products and services is in fact produced as much will be produced as by any method that we know can be produced, because we can through such a use of the market mechanism bring more of the dispersed knowledge of the members of society into play than by any other. But it will be achieved only if we leave the share in the total which each member will get to be determined by the market mechanism and all its accidents, because it is only through the market determination of in- comes that each is led to do what this result requires. 50. We owe, in other words, our chances that our unpredictable share in the total product of society represents as large an aggregate of goods and services as it does to the fact that thousands of others constantly submit to the adjustments which the market forces on them; and it is consequently also our duty to accept the same kind of changes in our income and position, even if it means a decline in our accustomed posi- tion and is due to circumstances we could not have foreseen and for which we are not responsible. The conception that we have « earned &gt; (in the sense of morally deserved) the income we had when we were more fortunate, and that we are therefore entitled to it so long as we strive as honestly as before and had no warning to turn elsewhere, is wholly mistaken. Everybody, rich or poor, owes his income to the outcome of a mixed game of skill and chance, the aggregate result of and the shares in which are as high as they are only because we have agreed to play that game. And once we have agreed to play the game and profited from its results it is a moral obligation on us to abide by the results even if they turn against us. 51. There can be little doubt that in modern society all but the most unfortunate and those who in a different kind of society might have enjoyed a legal privilege, owe to the adoption of that method an income much larger than they could otherwise enjoy. There is of course no reason why a society which, thanks to the market, is as rich as mo- dern society should not provide outside the market a minimum security for all who in the market fall below a certain standard. Our point was merely that considerations of justice provide no justification for «correc- ting» the results of the market and that justice, in the sense of treat- ment under the same rules, requires that each takes what a market provides in which every participant behaves fairly. There is only a justice of individual conduct but not a separate « social justice ». 52. We cannot consider here the legitimate tasks of government in the administration of the resources placed at its disposal for the ren- dering of services to the citizens. With regard to these functions, for the discharge of which the government is given money, we will here only say that in exercising them government should be under the same rules 614 -</page><page sequence="15">as every private citizen, that is should possess no monopoly for a particular service of the kind, that it should discharge these functions in such a manner as not disturb to the much more comprehensive sponta- neously ordered efforts of society, and that the means shoul be raised according to a rule which applies uniformly to all. (This, in my opi- nion, precludes an overall progression of the burden of taxation of the individuals, since such a use of taxation for purposes of redistribution could be justified only by such arguments as we have just excluded). In the remaining paragraphs we shall be concerned only with some of the functions of government for the discharge of which it is given not merely money but power to enforce rules of private conduct. 53. The only part of these coercive functions of government which we can further consider in this outline are those which are concerned with the preservation of a functioning market order. They concern pri- marily the conditions which must be provided by law to secure the de- gree of competition required to steer the market efficiently. We shall briefly consider this question first with regard to enterprise and then with regard to labour. - --m 54. With regard to enterprise the first point which needs under- lining is that it is more important that government refrains from assi- sting monopolies than that it combats monopoly. If today the market order is confined only to a part of the economic activities of men, this is largely the result of deliberate government restrictions of competition. It is indeed doubtful whether, if government consistently refrained from creating monopolies and from assisting them through protective tariffs and the character of the law of patents for inventions and of the law of corporations, there would remain an element of monopoly signifi- cant enough to require special measures. What must be chiefly remembe- red in this connection is, firstly, that monopolistic positions are always undesirable but often unavoidable for objective reasons which we cannot or do not wish to alter; and, secondly, that all government supervised monopolies tend to become government protected monopolies which will persist when their justification has disappeared. 55. Current conceptions of anti-monopoly policy are largely misgui- ded by the application of certain conceptions developed by the theory of perfect competition which are irrelevant to conditions where the factual presuppostions of the theory of perfect competition are absent. The theory of perfect competition shows that if on a market the number of buyers and sellers is sufficiently large to make it impossible for any one of them deliberately to influence prices, such quantities will be sold at prices which will equal marginal costs. This does not mean, however, that it is either possible or even necessarily desirable everywhere to bring about a state of affairs where large numbers buy and sell the same uniform commodity. The idea that in situations where we cannot, or do not wish to bring about such a state, the producers should be held to con- duct themselves as if perfect competition existed, or to sell at a price - 615</page><page sequence="16">which would rule under perfect competition, is meaningless, because we do not know what would be the particular conduct required, or the price which would be formed, if perfect competition existed. 56. Where the conditions for perfect competition do not exist what competition still can and ought to be made to achieve is nevertheless very remarkable and important, namely the conditions described in pa- ragraphs 46-49 above. It was pointed out then that this state will tend to be approached if nobody can be prevented by government of others to enter any trade or occupation he desired. 57. This condition would, I believe, be approached as closely as it is possible to secure this, if, firstly, all agreements to restrain trade were without exception (not prohibited, but merely) made void and unenfor- ceable, and, secondly , all discriminatory or other aimed actions towards an actual or potential competitor intended to make him observe certain rules of market conduct were to make liable for multiple damages. It seems to me that such a modest aim would produce a much more effective law than actual prohibitions under penalties, because no exceptions need to be made from such a declaration as invalid or unenforceable of all contract in restraint of trade, while, as experience has shown, the more ambitious attempts are bound to be qualified by so many exceptions as to make them much less effective. 58. The application of this same principle that all agreements in restraint of trade should be invalid and unenforceable and that indi- viduals should be protected against all attempts to enforce them by violence or aimed discrimination, is even more important with regard to labour. The monopolistic practices which threaten the functioning of the market are today much more serious on the side of labour than on the side of enterprise, and the preservation of the market order will depend more than on anything else on whether we succeed in curbing the latter. 59. The reason for this it that the development in this field are bound to force government, and are already forcing many governments, into two kinds of measures which are wholly destructive of the market order: attempts authoritatively to determine the appropriate incomes of the various groups (by what is called an «incomes policy») and efforts to overcome the wage « rigidities » by an inflationary monetary policy. But since this evasion of the real issue by only temporarily effective mo- netary means must have the effect that those « rigidities » will constantly increase, they are a mere palliative which can only postpone but not solve the central problem. 60. Monetary and financial policy are outside the scope of this pa- per. Its problems were mentioned only to point out that its funda- mental and in the present situation insolubable dilemmas cannot be sol- ved by any monetary means but only by a restoration of the market as an effective instrument for determining wages. 616 -</page><page sequence="17">61. In conclusion the basic principles of a liberal society may be summed up by saying that in such a society all coercive functions of government must be guided by the overruling importance of what I like to call The Three Great Negatives : Peace, Justice , and Liberty. Their achievement requires that in its coercive functions government be con- fined to the enforcement of such prohibitions (stated as abstract rules) as can be equally applied to all, and to exacting under the same uniform rules from all a share of the costs of the other, non coercive services it may decide to render to the citizens with the material and personal means thereby placed at its disposal (*). F. A. HAYEK Is this all so very different From what Lao-Tzu says In his fifty-seventh poem? : If I keep from meddling with people They take care of themselves, If I keep from commanding people, They behave themselves, If I keep from imposing on people, They become themselves. Résumé - Cet article qui est en effet essentiellement un résumé d'un long livre préparé pour être discuté au cours d'une conférence, peut très difficilement être résumé davantage. Son but est de donner un cadre in- tégré des fondéments légaux, moraux et politiques du libéralisme classique. En partant de la distinction entre un ordre spontané d'une part, et de la nécessaire organisation télocratique déliberée de l'autre, l'article montre que à ces deux différentes formes d'ordre correspondent deux types dif- férents de règles, malheureusement réunis ensemble sous le même terme « droit » et par conséquent générale- ment confondus. Ce sont des règles de juste conduite pour les individus ou les groupes organisés d'individus et règles d'organisation dont les pre- mières sont essentiellement formelles ou indépendantes tandis que les se- condes doivent toujours être simple- ment supplémentaires à des ordres spécifiques qui déterminent les buts à poursuivre et les fonctions que les individus doivent accomplir. Les pre- mières correspondent approximative- ment aux règles du droit privé et du droit criminel et les secondes au droit publique, comme les deux types d'or- dre correspondent approximativement à ce qu'on appelle généralement so- ciété et gouvernement ou état res- pectivement. On montre ensuite que l'idée de justice sociale ou distribu- tive a du sens seulement à l'intérieur d'une organisation mais nécessaire- ment elle n'a pas de sens à l'intérieur (*) This paper, submitted to the meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society held at Tokyo from the fifth to the tenth of September 1966, will also appear in a volume of essays by the author entitled Studies in Philosophy , Politics , and Economics which is now in the press. A German translation is due to appear in ORDO, vol. XVIII. - 617</page><page sequence="18">d'un cadre d'ordre spontané et que par conséquent toute tentative de rem- placer les règles de conduite de justice commutative par des règles d'organi- sation qui rendent possible la justice distributive, conduit nécessairement au remplacement de l'ordre spontané d'une société libre par l'organisation délibérée ou bien par l'organisation de l'Etat totalitaire. Après un bref examen de la nature des succès de la compétition, on in- dique les instruments qui sont néces- saires pour rendre le marché efficace. Zusammenfassung - Dieser Artikel ist im wesentlichen eine Zusammen- fassung eines grösseren Buches, das für eine Diskussion bei einem Vor- trag vorbereitet wurde und kann selbst kaum noch zusammengefaßt werden. Der Verfasser macht den Versuch, ein integriertes Bild der wirtschaftli- chen, juristischen, moralischen und politischen Grundlagen des klassischen Liberalismus zu entwerfen. Indem er von der Unterscheidung zwischen einer freiwilligen oder no- mokratischen Ordnung einerseits und einer notwendigerweise telokratischen Organisation der erwogenen Anord- nung andererseits ausgeht, zeigt er, daß diesen zwei verschiedenen Ord- nungsformen zwei ebenfalls verschie- dene Richtlinien entsprechen, die un- glücklicherweise unter der gleichen Bezeichnung «Gesetze» zusammenge- worfen wurden, und die man deshalb auch im allgemeinen verwechselt. Es sind Regeln über die korrekte Führung des Individuums oder orga- nisierter Gruppen von Individuen und Organisationsrichtlinien, von denen die ersteren im wesentlichen formell oder in der Folge unabhängig sind, die letzteren aber immer reine Er- gänzungen zu spezifischen Befehlen, die die zu verfolgenden konkreten Ziele und die von gewissen Indivi- duen zu erfüllenden Rollen oder Funk- tionen bestimmen. Die ersteren ent- sprechen grob gesagt den Regeln des privaten oder kriminellen Rechtes und die letzteren denjenigen des öffentli- chen Rechtes, etwa wie die zwei Ordnungssysteme ungefähr dem ent- sprechen, was man üblicherweise Ge- sellschafts- und Regierungsform oder Staat nennt. Es wird weiter gezeigt, daß der Begriff des sozialen oder distributiven Rechtes nur innerhalb einer Organisation bedeutungsvoll ist, aber notwendigerweise bedeutungslos im Kontext einer freiwilligen Ordnung. Demzufolge führen alle Versuche, die Führungsregeln des kommutativen Rechtes durch Organisationsrichtlinien zu ersetzen, die die distributive Justiz ermöglichen, notwendigerweise zu dem Ersatz der freiwilligen Ordnung einer freien Gesellschaft durch die über- legte Einrichtung der Organisation eines totalitären Staates. Nach einer kurzen Skizze des We- sens der Leistungen des Wettbewerbes werden die Erfordernisse gezeigt, um den Markt in ein wirklich leitendes Instrument zu verwandeln. 6X8 -</page></plain_text>
