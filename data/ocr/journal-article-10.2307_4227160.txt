<plain_text><page sequence="1">J JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES Vol. XX No. I March 1997 Notes and Communications A Note on the Intellectual Connection between Albert Einstein and Thorstein Veblen At the 1995 annual AFEE meetings in Washington, I presented a paper on the role of physics in early twentieth century institutional and neoclassical economics [Ganley 1995]. A secondary point of the paper was the suggestion that Albert Ein- stein and Thorstein Veblen shared similar views on the philosophy of science. This suggestion drew more comments than anything else in the paper. Many of the com- ments included the notion that Einstein had written about Veblen in a very favorable manner. Among the suggestions were the following: 1. Veblen was the only economist who made sense to Albert Einstein. 2. Veblen's economic analysis influenced Einstein's perspective on economic events. 3. Einstein considered Veblen to be the most important economic theorist of the era. This note is to follow up on these ideas and describe what Einstein actually wrote about Veblen. It was not as an economist that Einstein wrote of Veblen, but as a philosopher of science. Einstein on Veblen In the early 1940s, Einstein was asked to write a commentary on Bertrand Russell's theory of knowledge, and he agreed to do so. He knew Russell's work very well and thought highly of him as a philosopher of science. It was in the first few sentences of that essay that Einstein acknowledged his appreciation of Veblen's approach to scientific methodology: When the editor asked me to write something about Bertrand Russell, my ad- miration and respect for that author at once induced me to say yes. I owe in- numerable happy hours to the reading of Russell's works, something which I 245</page><page sequence="2">246 Notes and Communications cannot say of any other contemporary scientific writer, with the exception of Thorstein Veblen [Einstein 1944, 279; emphasis added]. Oswald Veblen and Einstein Thorstein Veblen's nephew, Oswald Veblen, was a mathematician of some con- siderable professional recognition. Princeton University conferred an honorary de- gree on Einstein in 1921, and Oswald Veblen, a member of Princeton's mathe- matics faculty, met Einstein at a post-ceremony reception. In 1927, Oswald Veblen offered Einstein a research professorship at Princeton University, which Einstein declined [Hoffman 1972, 163]. In 1930, Oswald asked Einstein's permission to use a quote from Einstein's 1921 address at a reception in his honor as an inscription over the fireplace in the faculty lounge in the newly built mathematics building at Princeton. Einstein consented to the inscription of the phrase: "God is subtle, but he is not malicious," even though he wrote to Veblen that he had meant to say "Nature conceals her mystery by means of her essential grandeur not by her cunning" [Clark 1971, 4221. This distant, somewhat detached relationship changed in 1933 when Einstein and Oswald Veblen became two of the first four faculty members of the In- stitute for Advanced Study, located in Princeton, New Jersey. Whether or not Einstein had read the writings of Thorstein Veblen prior to ac- tivities at the Institute for Advanced Study is not clear from any of the biographical material on his life. It is possible that his own pacificism may have attracted him to Veblen's writings on peace and war, or Einstein may have been interested in Ve- blen's writings on Germany. However, it is likely that Oswald Veblen introduced Einstein to the works of his uncle. Their relationship was familiar enough for Ein- stein to have squeezed in a visit with Oswald during a one-day house-hunting trip to Princeton in spring 1933. On the other hand, their relationship did not always run smoothly at the Institute. One history of the early days at the Institute noted that funding for Einstein's research assistants was blocked in 1937 by Oswald Veblen, who controlled funds for the mathematics section of the Institute. The conclusion I draw from all of this is that there is a high probability that Oswald Veblen played a role in introducing Einstein to Thorstein Veblen's writings, particularly on science. Einstein's Philosophy of Science Einstein felt compelled on numerous occasions to make explicit his epistemologi- cal viewpoint as it evolved in his later years: I see on the one side the totality of sense experience, and on the other, the to- tality of the concepts and propositions that are laid down in books... . The concepts and propositions get "meaning" or "content," only through their connection with sense experiences. The connection of the latter with the for-</page><page sequence="3">Notes and Communications 247 mer is purely intuitive, not itself of a logical nature. The degree of certainty with which this connection, or intuitive linkage, can be undertaken, and nothing else, differentiate empty fantasy from scientific "truth." The system of concepts is a creation of man, together with the rules of syntax, which constitute the structure of conceptual systems. Although the conceptual sys- tems are logically arbitrary, they are restricted by the aim of permitting the most nearly possible certain (intuitive) and complete coordination with the totality of sense experience [Einstein 1979, 11-13]. This viewpoint shared much in common with Thorstein Veblen's assessment of scientific knowledge and its epistemological foundations, which we will turn to in the next section. For Einstein, many of the theoretical concepts in physics were fic- titious constructs invented by physicists: mass, force, and inertial systems. In his 1933 Herbert Spencer Lecture at Oxford University, Einstein spelled out his views on the methodology of theoretical physics: any attempt logically to derive the basic concepts and laws of mechanics from the ultimate data of experience is doomed to failure . . . it is the case that axiomatic basis of theoretical physics cannot be an inference from expe- rience, but must be free invention [Einstein 1933, 14]. Einstein believed that the creative imagination of scientists was critical to the ad- vancement of scientific theory. The theorist had to be willing to take conceptual risks that were not necessarily well grounded in empirical evidence: The belief in an external world independent of the perceiving subject is the basis of all natural science. Since, however, sense perception only gives in- formation of this external world or of "physical reality" indirectly, we can only grasp the latter by speculative means. It follows from this that our no- tions of physical reality can never be final. We must always be ready to change these notions-that is to say, the axiomatic bases of physics-in order to do justice to perceived facts in the most perfect way logically [Einstein 1954, 266]. Albert Einstein saw the crucial problem in the history of the philosophy of sci- ence as a fear of metaphysics. He referred to this as David Hume's legacy to the philosophy of science, but it was a flaw found in Newton's theories as well. Newton was uncomfortable with the concept of absolute rest, because there was no empirical evidence to support it [Einstein 1933, 12]. As a consequence, Newton and other physicists in the past had feared metaphysical concepts would undermine the scien- tific rigor of scientific theories. Yet Einstein believed: There is no inductive method which could lead to the fundamental concepts of physics. Failure to understand- this fact constituted the basic philosophical error of the nineteenth century [Einstein 1950, 76].</page><page sequence="4">248 Notes and Communications The Veblen Attraction Why did Albert Einstein think so highly of Thorstein Veblen as a writer on sci- ence? In all likelihood, the primary attraction was to the essays in The Place of Sci- ence in Modern Civilization and Other Essays, published in 1919 (and several times thereafter). According to Veblen, the "modem" scientific community had evolved in an era when the instinct for workmanship was prominent. As a consequence of this cultural connection, the methodology of the natural sciences emphasized cause-and- effect relationships, similar in analytical terms to craftsmen working on materials in the creation or "manufacture" of a product. Veblen interpreted science, including the so-called scientific method, as culturally determined: The early-modem industry is, in an obvious and convincing degree, a matter of workmanship. The same has not been true before or since. The workman, more or less skilled and with more or less specialized efficiency, was the central figure in the cultural situation of the time; and so the concepts of sci- entists came to be drawn in the image of the workman. The dramatization of the sequence of external phenomena worked out under the impulse of idle cu- riosity were then conceived in terms of workmanship. Workmanship gradu- ally supplanted differential dignity as the authoritative canon of scientific truth, even on the higher levels of speculation and research. This, of course, amounts to saying . . . that the law of cause and effect was given the first place, as contrasted with dialectical consistency and authentic tradition. But, this early-modem law of cause and effect-the law of efficient causes-is of an anthropomorphic kind. "Like causes produce like effects," in much the same sense as the skilled workman's produce is like the workman; "nothing is found in the effect that was not contained in the cause" in much the same manner [Veblen 1906, 13-14; emphasis added]. The dawn of this scientific method had antecedents from earlier periods but only gained secure philosophical foundations with the rise of modem science. The natural laws of the eighteenth century were devised from the processes of the master crafts- men. The cause-and-effect relationship of the scientific method was in the historical analysis of Veblen nothing more than workshop specifications handed down from these master craftsmen to guide handicraftsmen in the implementation of the master designs [Veblen 1906, 15]. Workmanship had replaced differential authority as the foundation of scientific truth. As a consequence of the central cultural role of these skilled workmen, so the scientific concepts were drawn in the image of craft pro- duction and the workshop. In the Veblenian scheme, modem science became less personal and much more matter-of-fact, but the dramatic tone was not completely eliminated. Of even greater significance for Veblen's story of science was that in modem science the imputation</page><page sequence="5">Notes and Communications 249 of activity to the observed objects remained at the center of scientific theory. It was here that the minds of Einstein and Veblen met on the meaning of scientific theory: Activity continues to be imputed to the phenomena with which science deals; activity is, of course, not a fact of observation, but is imputed to the phe- nomena by the observer [Veblen 1906, 15]. Since Einstein's physicist freely created the most significant concepts for theo- retical physics, Veblenian analysis of science methodology was consistent with Ein- stein's assessment: physical concepts are free creations of the human mind, and are not, how- ever it may seem, uniquely determined by the external world [Einstein and Infeld 1961, 31]. As I have noted in an earlier work [Ganley 1995], Einstein could identify with Veblenian insights on scientific methodology because they were so similar to his own. One significant aspect of Veblen's methodology of sciences was the view that in scientific theory conceptual meaning was often imputed by the observer, not by inductive process. This was similar to Albert Einstein's understanding of the new physics of the twentieth century. For Veblen, the scientist's inquiry was often "as idle as that of the Pueblo-myth-maker" [Veblen 1906, 17]. A reasonable question can be raised about Veblen and Einstein: it may be one thing to say Einstein agreed with Veblen, yet how aware was Veblen of Einstein's physics? We go to his 1908 address at Berkeley, later published as "The Evolution of the Scientific Point of View" [Veblen 1908]. In a detailed assessment of early twentieth century science, Veblen acknowledged the need of many mathematical sci- entists to reject "metaphysical" concepts such as efficiency. This is very much the same fear of metaphysics that Einstein found a quarter of a century later. In fact, Veblen singled out theoretical physics as the scientific community most obsessed with the eradication of metaphysical postulates. There were theorists in physics who were preoccupied with a theoretical explanation for: how phenomena which to all appearance involve action at a distance do not involve action at a distance at all. The greater theoretical achievements of physics during the past century are within the sweep of this (metaphysical) principle that action at a distance does not take place, that apparent action at distance must be explained by effective contact, through a continuum, or by material transference. But this principle is nothing better than an unreasoning repugnance on the part of the physicists to admitting action at a dis- tance. . . . What stands in the way of its acceptance is the irrepressible an- thropomorphism of the physicists. And yet the great achievements of physics are due to the initiative of men animated with this anthropomorphismic re- pugnance to the notion of concomitant variation at a distance.... The latter-</page><page sequence="6">250 Notes and Communications day researchers in light, electrical transmission, the theory of ions, together with what is known of the obscure and late-found radiations and emanations, are to be credited to the same metaphysical preconception, which is never absent in any "scientific" inquiry in the field of physical science [Veblen 1908, ff 33-36]. Veblen had described exactly what Einstein found among the majority of physi- cists in the first decade of the twentieth century. There had been resistance to the concept of discontinuity and to the ideas and assumptions of quantum theory. Ein- stein was the first to fully utilize the quanta measurements in the photoelectric effect of 1905, the same year he had created the special theory of relativity. Here in Ve- blen he found not only a kindred soul, but someone who also seemed better able than physicists themselves to describe the reluctance of many to follow the path- breaking work of the new physics.
