Paper is namedhuun in the Maya language andamatl in Nahuatl. The hispanicized term applied today isamate. In the colonial Aztec Codex Mendoza it is stated that an enormous quantity of paper bundles were brought each year from various villages as tribute paid to the Aztec ruler Moctezuma II (von Hagen 1999, Christensen and Marti 1988:9). The utilization of native paper objects in secret and forbidden rites persisted during colonial times and documents of the Spanish inquisition describe the heathen ceremonies of burning cut papers together with blood and copal resin. The native bark paper was soon replaced by paper imported from Europe, but the old tradition and art of paper making survived in several remote and isolated villages, particularly in the Nahua-speaking municipalities of Ixhuatlân de Madero and Chicöntepec in the Mexican state of Veracruz, in San Gregorio, Tenango, Xalapa, municipality of Zacualtipan in the state of Hidalgo, and in the Otomi-spaking villages of San Pablito, municipality of Pahuatlän and Ixtoloya, municipality of Pantepec, both in the state of Puebla (von Hagen 1999:56). The continuance of the ancient art of paper making by Otomi Indians of today was rediscovered by Frederick Starr in 1899(Starr 1904,vonHagen 1999:56), and later investigations on the subject were conducted, among others, by Nicolas Leon ( 1924), Hans Lenz ( 1950,1973), Bodil Christensen ( 1942; Christensen and Marti 1988), and Victor Wolfgang von Hägen (1999). 5 Fig. 1. Cut brown amate figurine, representing the Black Bean God.19.5xl3.5cm. San Pablito, a settlement of Otoml speaking Indians in the Sierra Norte de Puebla, is renowned as a village of brujeria (witchcraft) and the only remaining maj or center of indigenous papermakers. The fibres of the inner bark of diverse wild fig trees (ficus sp.) and mulberry trees (morus celtidifolia) are used to produce dark and light brown sheets of paper. Curanderos (curers), sometimes called witches (brujos and brujas in Spanish), cut images of spirit entities from this paper foruse in various rituals. Earlier researchers reported that light paper is used in white magic and dark paper is used in black magic but this assumption has not been affirmed by modern invesgtigators. Both types of bark paper are used in rituals associated with agriculture, divining, and curing. The brujos/ curanderos, or more appropiatly termed as ritual specialists, use scissors to cut anthropomorphic images (in Spanish munecos, dolls) of spirit entities, each with iconographie motifs that indicate whether the spirit is benevolent or malevo lent. The spirits are also named as deities. In addition, the Otomi of San Pablito cut paper camas (beds), upon which the paper figurines are laid during rituals. Ritual specialists first fold the paper before it is cut, producing symmetrical images when unfolded. The munecos and camas are central features of Otomi rituals. During a particular curing ceremony, the ritual or religious specialist (healer, curer, medicine man, sorcerer, shaman) may kill a chicken and sprinkle its blood over the paper figurines lying on their paper beds while praying and chanting, in an effort to rid the patient of malevolent spirits. Surviving rituals and associated paper cuttings used in rain-making and agricultural fertility rites, love "magic", sor cery, divination and curing in San Pablito were studied in detail Vol. XXXIV • Dezember 2012</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 2. Polychrome painted amate sheet, depicting flowers, bird, and deer. 30.5x21.5 cm. by many researchers and are subject of several articles and monographs (Starr 1904; Leön 1924; Christensen 1942; von Hägen 1999; Lenz 1950,1973; Christensen and Marti 1988; Spranz 1961 ; Knecht 1966; Lannik, Palm and Tatkon 1969; Dow 1974; Fitl 1975; Jansen and Leyenaar 1975; Anders 1976,1980, 1999; Andersand Jansen 1986,1999:77-96; Sandstrom 1978, 1981; Dow 1982; Sepülveda 1983:133-139; Sandstrom and Sandstrom 1986; Galinier 2011). Ferdinand Anders (1976:21-29) reports that several brujos, who created and used munecos, are known by name. In 1941 Manuel Reyes was an informant of the anthropologist Bodil Christensen. Manuel del Agua is said to have produced part of the figurines analyzed by Bodo Spranz ( 1961 ), and another part was made by Santos Garcia, who named himself the "bruj o mayor de San Pablito". A well-known brujo who produced cut out "magic figures" was Carlos Sandoz Mendoza (Anders and Jansen 1986:31, 1999:85), but the most famed is the son of Santos Garcia, Alfonso Garcia Tellez, who cut three distinctive sets (in Spanisch/'uegos orjuntas) of amate figurines (Jansen andLeyenaar 1975, Anders and Jansen 1999:85): the Juego de Semillas, concerning fruits, seeds and bees and many differ ent spirits, the Juego de Ataque, including a series of various good and bad spirits and camas, and the Juego del Senor del Monte, consisting of numerous figurines of spirits, camas, pumas, birds, etc. Originally, the Otomi in San Pablito used cut out munecas only for their own magic-religious curing and witchcraft performances, however at later times the figurines were sold to outsiders and offered on the handicraft markets and curio shops in Mexico City. ;r'- : • U 'h '• !:? 4 v * ! : ■-1 '&gt;4 .A*V P - -. 'fjidki ^1 ; ;; , '. f r ' * Fig. 3. Front cover of the Garcia Tellez Manuscript I, 1978. The Otomi brujos were ingenious and soon created pic tures for commercial marketing, consisting of mostly beige colored cuttings of figurines mounted on rectangular dark brown amate paper (Fig. 1). Plain amate paper sheets were also exported to Nahua speaking communities in the Mexican state of Guerrero, where they were used as a medium for polychrome, naïve, vivid paintings, creating a souvenir and folklore object for the national tourism trade. The paintings are now known all over the world (Fig. 2). These souvenirs are the latest development in the ancient Mesoamerican paper making tradition. Thus the sacred paper objects, formerly employed in traditional ritual contexts, became valuable items in the international tourist market (Jansen and Leyenaar 1975:38, Sandstrom and Sandstrom 1986). A lesser known aspect of Otomi tourist art is the making of small books from handmade paper where the lighter paper is used as a background surface, and brown and darker munecos, the "sacred paper cuttings", are glued on. These figures are accompanied by Spanish texts written in capital letters with felt-tipped pens. The description and explanation found in the texts focus predominantly on ceremonies involving offerings to the rain deities and countless spirits of seeds and plants, as well as traditional, old curing practices. The bound manu scripts are essential testimonials, written by indigenous curanderos, revealing their knowledge of the beliefs, the religious world, the cosmovision, and secretcostumbres(c\is toms) of their ancestors.

The known copies have asizeofl4&gt;&lt;17.5 and 14.5 x 18.9 cm, and consist of 28 double pages of text with 29 or 30 cut-out images. Alan Sandstrom (1981) designates this booklet as "Book I" of the "Lopez Manuscripts" and provides an excellent, full docu mentation of it, with facsimiles of all leaves, a transcription of the Spanish handwritten text into typeface, accompanied by an English translation. Ursula Dyckerhoff (1984) published a study on her own Antonio Lopez copy, considering it as "a doubtless authentic expression by natives relating to the magic figures of San Pablito and associated concepts". She presented in a study the complete transcribed and annotated Spanish text, illus trated with 24 photographs, taken by Hanns J. Prem. Generally, the "pirate" editions, created by Lopez, feature cut figurines in a style and execution much inferior to the fine and well-cut Garcia illustrations. The Alfonso Garcia Tellez Manuscript II (Lluvia) Thisbookletis 18cm high and 14cm wide, isin the same form like the Manuscript I, and consists also of 28 pages. The 390 cm long strip shows on its front side 17 figures. The front cover reads: "OFRENDA PARA PEDIR LA LLUVIA EN SAN PABLITO PAHUATLAN PUE. AUTOR SR. ALFONSO GARCIA TELLEZ. 10 DE AGOSTO DE 1975". The author's signature is on the lower right-hand side of the page. The central design shows two identical munecas, standing anthro pomorphic figurines, identified as ancient deities (see front cover). Pages 1 through 7 show only texts on the top of the pages.

On page 8 is a cama de antigua, the following pages depict a pantheon of deities associated mainly with fruits and fruit plants, like beans, chilli, maize, coffee, tomato, jicama (Fig. 5), banana, orange, and papaya. A rare image of a dios de abeja (Bee God) is found on page 17. On page 3 is the text describing the ceremony of an offering made to appeal for rain : "Esta j unta se va tratar una ofrenda para pedir la lluvia, se reune toda la gente principal del pueblo, y se pregunta porque no a venido la lluvia para la cosecha porque las milpa ya se esta hechando a perder por eso dice toda la gente que le da lastima por eso se va hacer una junta particular". The manuscript is an account of a village meeting in order to organize a sacrificial offering to appeal for rain, as the villagers were fearing crop loss because it has not rained in a long time. In 1979, Tyrakowski ( 1980:966) purchased another copy of this manuscript in a shop in Mexico City, names it Book II, which has a slightly different title: "Tratamento de una ofrenda para pedir la lluvia". It is not dated, but signed. It has 28 pages, featuring 21 munecos, predominantly depicting the Spirits of the Seeds. The text describes a 15 day-long ceremony to attract rain. The screen-fold booklet is still in his possession. A plagiarized edition, written by Antonio Lopez M. is known, but no year of writing has been revealed (Sandstrom 1978:43; 1981). It is 17 cm high and 14.5 cm wide and has 27 pages of text with 21 cut-out images. Alan Sandstrom (1981 : 54-82) names it the "Book II" of the "Lopez Manuscripts" and published facsimiles of all pages, with a transcription of the handwritten Spanish text and an English translation, docu menting this work in full. The Alfonso Garcia Tellez Manusript III (Tecuil) This booklet is identical in its form to the Manuscripts I and II, has a size of 18 x 14 cm, but consists of only 22 pages. The entire length of the illustrated pages is 308 cm and shows 18 figures. The front cover reads: "HISTORIA DE UNA VIVIENDA PARA HACER UNA OFRENDA AL SANTO TECUIL. ESTE E JEMPL AR SE TERMIN ODE IMPRIMIR EL DIA 15DEABRILDE1981PORELAUTORELCURANDERO Y ARTES ANIA. SAN PABLITO PAHUATLAN PUE." The author has not mentioned his name, but can be identified by his signature at the lower right-hand corner of the cover. The author is Alfonso Garcia Tellez. The central motif of the cover is a cut brown paper design, representing a snake-like reptile with a headdress, in profile, facing right (Fig. 6). mexicon • Vol. XXXIV • Dezember 2012 133</page><page sequence="6">134 In contrast to the other booklets by Garcia, it features not only native bark paper figurines, but also on pages 6,7,11 and 14 modern, commercial, red tissue paper, illustrating the munecos of a diosa del temascal (The goddess of the indig enous steam bath), the spirit or dios del Tecuil, testigo del purgatorio, an abstract symbol of the fire of purgatory, and the deity of the temascal. The deity Tecuil or Tequil is the Spirit of the Hearth, a guardian of the house (Sandstrom 1981:17), and in one Tecuil librito there is a human image described as "La Diosa de Tecuil de Temascal)". Texts without associated figures are on pages 1,10,13, and 18. All other pages show texts on top of the pages, and underneath cut designs with captions (Fig. 7). Pages 2,15, and 20 show different "beds", acama del dios de tecuil, acama del dios del arbol de la casa, and lacama de maldadpara hacer brujeria. The depiction of a house is simple and is described as "la casa de antigua que dejo el difunto aqui va hacer la ofrenda del tecuil" (page 9). Two pages illustrate curanderos: there is "el curandero que esta haciendo la adivinanza" (page 4), and "el curandero va adonde esta la casa" (page 8). The contents of the manuscript refer to sacri ficial rites involving the Spirit of the House, including the use of munecos. The Tecuil librito by Garcia previously has not been published in the literature. Tyrakowski owns two exam ples, both of an 18 x 14 cm size, in screen format, consisting of 22 pages, illustrated with Amate figures and figures made with thin, red paper tissue. Both were made on April 15,1981, one is with Garcla's signature, the other, which was bought in San Pablito, is not signed. For the sake of completeness it should be mentioned, that there is a fourth booklet by Alfonso Garcia Tellez, purchased by Konrad Tyrakowski (1980:966,967) directly from the author in his house in San Pablito, designated as 3. Buch (Third Book), titled on the front cover "Historia de un brujo nagual de San Pablito Pahuatlan Puebla", but on the first page its title is different: "Historia de un brujo nagual de Tuzuncal de la Sierra de Chicontepec". Tyrakowski remarks that the manuscript, which he still owns, is dated August 10,1978 and consists of 22 pages, each measuring 22 cm in width and 17 cm in height. The brown amate figures are not cut symmetrically and are glued on papel de china (China paper), a thin commercial tissue, accompanied by amate figures of houses, seats, and drawings of trees using green and brown felt-tipped pens. The munecos are shown in profile. This librito is very different from the other manuscripts and combines cuttings and line draw ings and the screen-folded leaves are not in the usual high format. The text focuses on the treatment of a sick child by a curandero. On the inner back cover is written that copying of the book is prohibited. Preliminarily, this librito is here desig nated as "The Alfonso Garcia Tellez Manuscript IV" {Nagual). In concluding it should be noted, that copies of the four known entitled Garcia manuscripts were created between August 1975 and April 1981. The differing handwritten texts prove that the libritos were manufactured by different people, some on the same day.
