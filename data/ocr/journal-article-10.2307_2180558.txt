Such a procedure should be suggestive in these days when categories and ontology are somewhat at a discount. It will be noted that I employ the term ontology rather than metaphysics, since the latter term seems to be easily misleading because of its verbal associations. People have the tradition of thinking of metaphysics as something beyond physics in a theo- logical sort of way; and they have, of course, good Aristotelian and Thomistic and even idealistic precedent for such a perspec- tive. But the naturalist is concerned with being or existence and he considers physics as a basic empirical science about being, chiefly at the inorganic level. It concerns itself with primary constituents, properties and laws. It follows, of course, that, if the physicist were equally concerned with the clear apprehension of categories, he would be an ontologist also. The dividing line is a matter of degree, for there are capable philosophical physicists. And yet I am persuaded that the inter- pretation of such categories as matter, space, time, and causality, requires the deepening and supplementation which epistemology and ontology alone can contribute. All of which amounts to saying that the philosophical approach is distinctive and unavoidable. The reason for this belief will, I hope, become evident in the details of the argument of this paper, which, in the main, will be of the nature of an attempt to integrate epistemology and ontology. However, I permit myself at this point the suggestion that the common tendency to take the theory of relativity as an ontological principle illustrates what I have in mind. Equally relevant is the I</page><page sequence="2">2 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. LII. fact that science can be given operational and positivistic transla- tions as well as the more realistic ones which the majority of scien- tists probably entertain as an extension of common sense. I would hold, then, that science requires a philosophical completion, not as regards facts and theories, but as regards categorial setting. Of course, scientists are invited to pass their criticisms upon this at- tempted philosophical supplementation, for I do not think that there is anything very esoteric about it. It reflects not much more than an intellectual division of labor. I shall use the term physical realism as an indication of my position. It is, I may point out, a shortened expression for critical realism and evolutionary naturalism taken together. Thus it sym- bolizes the integration of epistemology and ontology of which 1 have spoken. Physical realism is a post-Humian position. Much of its effort has had to do with the escape from subjectivism and phenomenalism. As a physical realist it is my thesis that scientific knowledge, that is, empirical, and not formal or purely mathematical, know- ledge, is highly probable knowledge or disclosure about what exists, and that its facts and theories inexorably involve an ontology for their reference and philosophical meaning. This view does not, of course, imply that any particular science need greatly con- cern itself about this philosophical completion, but that the culture of the time cannot and will not ignore it. Modest as a philosopher must be in this age of science and technology, I would, nevertheless, suggest that the development of science as a whole is affected by its basic assumptions. It is doubtful that science is as completely selfsufficient as it was led in the nineteenth century to regard itself. The position adopted here signifies that being (what exists) has categorial characteristics which are disclosed in the categorial meanings operating in sense-perception, self-awareness, and the sciences, and that it is the job of basic philosophy to apprehend them and to clarify them. It will, perhaps, be remembered that, in my book, Evolutionary Naturalism, I argued that categorical mean- ings have a natural, empirical origin and an ontological reference and significance. While recognizing the value of Kant's stress upon categories as against Hume's scepticism, I criticized his extreme innatism and his phenomenalism. I still regard this contrast as</page><page sequence="3">No. i.] CAUSALITY AND SUBSTANCE 3 basic and fruitful. In other words, I am not one of those who would throw common-sense categories away in a nonchalant fash- ion as do those who have the virus of logical apriorism in their veins. I simply regard myself as more adequately empirical than Hume's atomism and sensationalism permitted him to be and far more so than those who hover between sensationalism and con- ventionalism. In my opinion, then, knowledge, being, and the categories, are both causally and formally connected. They are reciprocally eluci- dating. Being without categorial characteristics is scarcely think- able; and in knowledge-claims, being is characterized through categorial meanings. In this fashion all three are tied together. So much in the way of perspective. The category of causality furnishes an excellent illustration of the dangers confronting conceptual apprehension as a result of an inadequate philosophical context. It is well known that Hume re- jected its ontological setting and sought to re-conceive it in a subjective and phenomenalistic setting. So taken, causality was reduced to a weak form having something to do with experiential sequences and expectations. Hume was forced to this reduction because he found himself unable to give either it or substance an empirical foundation and so refused to fall back on what rightly seemed to him an obscurantist type of rationalism. The critical realist would suggest that at least one root of the difficulty was the confusion of acts of cognition with the occurrence of sensations and images, which, after all, but furnish some of the raw material for denotative and depictive acts. However that may be, both substance and causality were really dismissed together, although something weaker which was of the nature of succession in experience was given the name of causation. It was this shift which I have spoken of as taking causality out of its ontological context. I do not deny that a new emphasis, reflecting the newer developments in science, also entered, that temporalism and con- tingency received overdue recognition. But I do claim that it is really doubtful whether the category of causality remained after this removal of the ontological context.</page><page sequence="4">4 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. LII. What, in the main, I shall try to do is to reverse Hume's action and, while retaining temporalism and contingency, give causality once more its ontological setting. By so doing, it will again be linked with physical systems conceived dynamically and rela- tionally; and, through this linkage, it will be tied in with such categories as substance, activity, time, space, tendency, potentiality, and emergence. In my opinion it is only in this fashion that scientific knowledge can be given a philosophical completion, that is, can be harmonized with what seem to me basic ontological categories. As I have al- ready indicated, I am quite aware that many contemporary think- ers of distinction do not feel this need. That is the continuing Humian note. But I do, for reasons which I hope to make clearer as I proceed. The critical realist-for whom empirical knowledge is a me- diated affair-recognizes that science is likely to contain some measure of epistemic translation in its facts and laws. Thus the past does not exist in nature while it is dated and described in human knowledge. There is something hypothetical in laws in so far as they set up conditions. I suggest that such terms as space- time, change, event, probability, and fact, can only be properly accounted for and understood in the light of an adequate ontology. It is only those who identify empirical knowledge with a direct intuition of reality and do not grasp the manipulations and com- parisons involved who are surprised by this descriptive spreading out which emphasizes chronologies, predictions, facts, and laws. Let it be remembered that neither the past nor the future exists and it will be realized that the actual cannot be reduced to a mere present event. At least, so it seems to me; and that is one reason why I am led to explore such categories as substance and poten- tiality. These must, however, be so conceived that they harmonize with modern scientific knowledge. It is not too much to say that many of the paradoxes of philoso- phy and much of the misunderstanding of the nature of such things as moral decision result from this refusal to correlate scien- tific knowledge with ontology. Thus causation has been thought of as a push by a non-existent past and moral choice has been conceived, curiously enough, as an event succeeding other events</page><page sequence="5">No. i.] CAUSALITY AND SUBSTANCE 5 and not, more deeply, as an activity of the whole organic self. This contrast between event and activity seems to me intriguing. May it not in some measure correspond to the different perspective of scientific knowledge and ontology? Why so many philosophers should ignore such fascinating topics is a marvel to me. But, so long as epistemology and ontology are ignored or kept from their fruitful interaction by positivism and pragmatism, such will be the case. By linking causality with substance, taken in a dynamic or activistic sense, I shall be led to distinguish between transeunt causality, immanent causality, and emergent causality. These dis- tinctions will be situational in character but also qualitative. I shall attempt to give the notion of emergence a rational ontological ground. It is my thesis that the ontological categories are intrin- sically related and that each fades to the extent it is taken from its connection with the others. The ontological situation, as I see it, is analogous to what the logicians call entailment. It is as though substance were a superordinate category which found implication and expression in subordinate ones such as causality, activity, potentiality, space, and time. In other words, these subordinate categories are adjectival in nature and expose the dynamic and structural nature of substance. Certainly, one reason for the his- torical desiccation of the category of substance was its -abstraction from these subordinate categories. Only in this fashion did it become "something I know not what" or the reflection of the subject-predicate form. Even the idealist's substitution of self or person for it represents in part this desiccation. We shall, in fact, see that self-awareness is a significant source of the proper appre- hension of the category of substance, though it must be taken in the context of emergence or evolutionary naturalism. Since Hume-and that is one of his recognized glories-no discussion of causality can get intelligently under way without attention being paid to the epistemic side. How do we apprehend this category? And why, and by what right, do we apply it both to ourselves and the things around us? Kant drove these further questions home. Now I take all categories, from the epistemic side, to be grad- ually apprehended concepts grasped within experience. And I</page><page sequence="6">6 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. LII. further suppose such apprehension not to be arbitrary but to be based upon traits of cognitional and conational, or practical, ex- perience. Both of these activities concern themselves, I would hold, with self and things rather than with sensations and feelings. Here is where denotative realism makes a profound difference to epistemic analysis. For many reasons, some of which were con- nected with his views of space and time, Kant turned his back upon physical realism and embraced a phenomenalism for which knowing was a kind of constructing. Hence, though he was even more aware than Hume of categorial meanings, he did not give them realistic significance. II The resources of both genetic and analytic psychology would be required for any adequate psychological verification of the categorial meanings with which I am concerned. All I can do here is to indicate the perspective which, it seems to me, any epistemic study of causality and substance must emphasize. It is not sufficiently recognized that Hume admitted the presence and operation of instincts and beliefs with respect to both things and selves. "It seems also evident that, when men follow this blind and powerful instinct of nature, they always suppose the very images, presented by the senses, to be the external objects, and never entertain any suspicion that the one are nothing but representations of the other." Both here and with respect to the self we find his rational principles at war with his natural beliefs. But his rational principles turn out upon examination to reflect assumptions which are highly doubtful. These lead him to turn his back upon denotative symbolism and explicit judgment with the use of thinghood as a category and to embrace in a mood of resigned scepticism a radical empiricism of atomic sense-impres- sions and images, a radical empiricism which has ever since ap- pealed to many as toughminded, though it is really very artificial and tenderminded. To make a long story short, I would hold that the field of the individual's experience is dominated by denotative reference in both sense-perception and self-awareness, and that these two direc-</page><page sequence="7">No. i.] CAUSALITY AND SUBSTANCE 7 tions develop together and are of genetic assistance to each other. The individual's attitudes and interests help to give body and objectivity to their objective or Gegenstand, and it is for this reason that sensations are caught up into a perceptive form and seem the very surface of the objective not-self which the embodied self is concerned with. All this seems to me genetically and epis- temically natural, and I am persuaded that critical realism has shown that it can be epistemologically developed in such a fashion that empirical knowledge turns out to be of the nature of judg- mental assertions about denoted, but not intuited, objects in the environment of the organic self. But into the purely epistemological aspect of the question I do not wish to enter, for I have written about it almost ad nauseam and with too little stimulating criticism on the part of fellow philosophers. What I desire to do here is to call attention to the corresponding mechanism and categorial form of self-awareness. In place of the stream-of-consciousness psychology I would put a thing-and-self psychology dominated by directions and categorial meanings. It seems to me, in short, that sense-perception and self- awareness must be taken as co-ordinate and mutually implicated. As I see it, the tension of felt attitudes has a double direction, one outward and the other inward. In its outward direction it gives body to sensations and helps to put them into a perceptive form which is deepened by memories and expectations. But in its in- ward direction there is a corresponding development of subjectiv- ity, or selfness, also deepened by memories and anticipations. Desires and hopes and fears play about this subjective counter- ref erence. It is in this fashion, I believe, that the form of self- awareness develops step by step with the form of sense-perception. What deepens the one deepens the other also. But feelings, organic sensations, and desires, constitute the psychical material taken up symbolically and cognitively in this self-reference much as visual and touch sensations are taken up into objective perceptual form. As I shall try to show, in both cases reflection emphasizes reference and denotation and queries intuition of the object. We shall find, indeed, that intuition has more to say for itself in the case of self-knowledge than in the case of external perception. However,</page><page sequence="8">8 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. LII. ontological questions of the relation of substance to its momentary activation will appear in connection with the equivalence of feeling to the enduring organic self. Before I go further I should like to point out that explicit cate- gorial meanings like those of thinghood and selfhood are subjects of reflective examination only in philosophic thought. Yet that they are apprehended and verbalized long before cannot be doubted. It is quite evident that such meanings emerge from biologically founded patterns. As factors they are operative in the life of the lower animals. Such meanings are relational and directional in character and are, I suppose, carried by feelings, sensations, and images. I would not take these latter terms atomistically but on a background of attention and action giving continuity and com- presence with transition. What I wish to stress is that categorial meanings emerge and operate in this fashion and that what may be called a conceptual apprehension of them presupposes this prior status. Otherwise it would be artificial and without foundation. We perceive things and are aware of the self long before we apprehend with any clarity what things are and what the self is. One aim of the present study is to stimulate such clarified apprehension which, since Hume's dampening scepticism, has not been any too evident. My thesis is that the conceptual apprehension of categories presupposes the empirical presence of categorial meanings in the operative forms of sense-perception and self-awareness. Here is where realistic empiricism differs from Humian empiricism. And yet, as we say, Hume acknowledged these meanings but did not see how they could be given a rational explanation in terms of his psychological and epistemological assumptions. Critical realism breaks with these assumptions in the fashion I have indicated. III It is tremendously important that the status of the organism in self-awareness be correctly grasped. I take it to be empirically correct to speak of the embodied self or the organic self. Certainly I have no intuition of the self as distinct from the organism. And it seems to me clear that Cartesian dualism is a theory resting</page><page sequence="9">No. i.] CAUSALITY AND SUBSTANCE 9 upon assumptions which evolutionary naturalism undercuts. I re- fer here both to the doctrine of emergence and to the double- knowledge approach to the mind-body problem. Let us look at our actual experience in self-awareness. Is it not a fact that, guided by organic sensations and feelings, we expe- rience ourselves to be in some sense in the body? There is a diffuse localization in the body as against other perceived things set over against it. Psychologists have pointed out this nuclear basis and the attachments and deepenings which it acquires in the awareness of desires and aversions and in the localization of eye-movements and muscular activities. But why do more than refer to these well known facts? The self at what one might call the sensuous level is noted through, and by means of, such subjective, intra-bodily localized, data. All this is a matter, not of theory, but of experiential distinctions. It is only later for theory that the mind and the realistically conceived body, or organism, must be integrated anew in answer to dualistically formulated ontological conceptions. We are concerned here with the awareness of self. And the primary self seems to me to be denoted and symbolized through subjective, psychical material localized within the body. I take it that memory and anticipations play much the same supplementary role here as they do for our perception of thinghood. The self tends to be thought of as indwelling and more than the passing feelings which are states or expressions of it. The correspondence with sense-perception is fairly complete. In both directions there is the same development of meanings of endurance and capacity. The body may well help to mediate this double development, since the awareness of the body is fairly constant. I am convinced that I could move my body if I would. The self retreats in some measure from the muscular integument and we think of the latter more as an instrument of the self we are aware of. It is in this sense that we seem to ourselves to look out through the eyes and feel with the hands. But into the subtle details of the conceptualization of the self we cannot here enter. Social intercourse has much to do with this development of desires, actions, and thoughts, which do, quite literally, develop the self upon its biological base. But the point I</page><page sequence="10">IO THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. LII. wish particularly to make is that, without the primary self-aware- ness we have discussed above, the concepts of the self could secure no existential reference and attachment. I find that pragmatists like Mead and Dewey have never sufficiently grasped this fact be- cause they were not sufficiently interested in epistemology and ontology. They never clearly distinguished between the concept of the self and the self. And to the physical realist this distinction is basic. The point I wish now to make is that the self is never something given alongside of the feelings and desires through which it is disclosed any more than an external thing can be something given alongside of the sense-data. In both cases the denoted object is something apprehended through data and categorial meanings. Hume was on a false search. As I see it, the difference between inorganic things and the self is at least twofold: (i) a difference in capacities, and (2) the self is in some fashion integral to the human organism whose capacities are somehow its capacities. To make a long story short, I see every reason to believe that the organism is the self, not something-I-know-not-what located in liver, heart, or brain. It is the activities and operations of the organism that we apprehend through our feelings and concepts. We may be said to pass from a sensuous to a conceptual appre- hension of the self, apprehension being a directed awareness through concepts. IV It is in this fashion that I argue for a realistic empiricism as against phenomenalistic empiricism. It is evident that such realistic empiricism gives a foundation for ontological categories, for it asserts that categorial meanings develop in both sense-perception and self-awareness and that these meanings are conceptualized and mediate the conceptual apprehension of the categorial char- acteristics of our world. Now I take substance to be a category to whose full conception all our knowledge of self and things is necessary. It is to me analysable in the sense that any adequate conceptual apprehension of it involves such meanings as endurance, activities, potentialities, causality, etc. As I see it, such conceptual apprehension is mediated by all relevant knowledge of a generic sort. I doubt that the</page><page sequence="11">No. i.] CAUSALITY AND SUBSTANCE II category of substance excludes even space and time when these are grasped as categorial meanings and not merely equated with scientific measurements. In short, substance is an abstract, but internally complex, concept, and to brush it aside as a mere pro- jection of the subject-predicate linguistic form seems to me the height of absurdity. In order that we may keep our promised integration of episte- mology and ontology let us try to see how this approach to sub- stance through both self and things affects the interpretation of this category. It is clear that we must distinguish between the generic charac- teristics of substance and the specific characteristics which dis- tinguish one level of nature from another. I take it that new capacities emerge which are yet compatible with the generic ones of endurance, potentiality, dynamism, and causal capacity. And it is my hypothesis that organization is the clue to such emergence. I shall have more to say of this point later when I study emergent causality. At present I am primarily interested in clarifying the difference between the knowledge of self and the knowledge of things. I have argued that the categorial meanings apprehended in the concept of substance develop in the situation where we pass back and forth between sense-perception and self-awareness. There is control and countercontrol, action and reaction. It is likewise clear that the body itself helps in this linkage of the two. The body is a thing as well as the embodiment of the self. For each individual there is an ultimate epistemological dif- ference, which he assumes for other selves, that is, that he is out- side of other things and can only get revelatory messages from them while he is participating in the activity of its own body-self. It is the organic self which desires, feels, judges, makes decisions. The data used in knowing the self are expressions of its activity. Nowhere else in nature has the individual the same privileged position. And, of course, it is rationally quite understandable. We should, therefore, expect the inorganic world to be more opaque in the sense that we are limited in its case to the kind of descriptive knowledge disclosed by sensory data. The result is what I called an epistemological translation, or spreading out, especially marked</page><page sequence="12">I2 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. LII. as regards scientific space and time, and a tendency to feel a trifle bewildered by the category of substance itself. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that even causality shares an analogous fate and, with it, the rational basis of induction. It is, I believe, the strategic role of philosophy to emphasize the significance of a naturalistic approach to the organic self. Here we are dominated by the thought of an enduring, highly organized, and active substance which we are and by the conviction that our experiences of feeling, thinking and deciding are one with, and expressions of, such substantial activities. Here is the perspective of empirical realism as against phenomenalism. My break with Hume should now be evident. It is at once epistemological and ontological; and the two are in- separable though distinguishable. It rests on the thesis that em- pirical knowledge involves a directed claim to disclose a world which is conceptually apprehended as substantial. Because Hume ignored, or rejected, this framework and thought of knowledge as an affair of sensory givenness, his treatment of substance and causality was inevitable. Let us now turn to the epistemic side of causality. Here, again, I would argue that the categorial concept rests upon a categorial meaning which emerges in experience. Of late there has been a rise of interest in the subjective source of this category. Ewing, Broad, Stout, Pratt, Swabey, and Parker, have argued for an awareness of causal relatedness in the indi- vidual's experience. The epistemic side of the problem is concerned with the experiences in self-awareness and sense-perception which develop into this type of categorial meaning which can then be more and more conceptualized. In large measure it is a genetic question and involves the growth in awareness of the self's doing and suffering. But such awareness is integrated with the percep- tion of things as affecting us and of ourselves as handling and moving things. I take it that our feeling of ourselves as pervading the organism has much to do with the growth of these relational meanings. But as desire, memory, and decision, constitute larger elements in the thought of the self, such experiences as the direc- tion of the attention, trying to remember a name, making a moral choice, seem to me to be regarded as disclosing the self as active. It is not, I suppose, that we intuit a conational element as such,</page><page sequence="13">No. i.] CAUSALITY AND SUBSTANCE I3 but that we are led to think the self as active and as disclosed in these relational experiences. In short, activity seems to me to be a categorial meaning developing around primary -self-awareness. Once this level is reached we are convinced that the self has something to do with the movement of the eyes or the use of the various bodily organs even though we can trace no continuity between volition and action. The important point to bear in mind is that we do not claim to know the self exhaustively and to intuit just how it operates. So far as I can see we have nothing more than the apprehension that the self is operating and expressing itself and that we are consciously on the inside of this operating, consciously participating in it. For instance, to use Dr. Ewing's example, we can note how we react to the thought of the death of a friend; and we are convinced that this reaction gives us know- ledge of our character and disposition. We think the self through what we believe to be a set of relevant experiences bearing upon the self. Now I have not the space to go into the details of this deepening awareness of the self as active, which I take to be the basis of the growth of the categorial meaning of causality. Suffice it to point out that the position I am advocating does not hold to any intuition of force or energy as these terms are used in physical science. We should not expect to intuit how our muscles are innervated nor should we expect to see necessary connections in nature. Rather am I pointing out that we are led to deepen our conception of the self as a substance, that is, an enduring unity having dispositions and capacities, by this additional category of causal activity. Sub- stance, dispositions, capacities, activity, doing and suffering, what are all of these but supplementary concepts? That we have such concepts and use them in our conceptual apprehension of the self there seems to me little doubt. I am simply arguing that these con- cepts rest upon categorial meanings developed around sense- perception and self-awareness but more dominantly around the latter. It would' scarcely be fair not to mention Whitehead's appeal to the mode of causal efficacy as against the mode of presentational immediacy. I can appreciate his motive and agree with what may be called his subjective emphasis. My divergence lies chiefly in</page><page sequence="14">I4 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. LII. my stress upon the operation of the category of selfhood. It seems to me that the categorial meaning of causal activity develops from experiences of the sort indicated above as they are used to inter- pret a substantial self which can do things. I can and do attend to things; I have desires and make a choice; I have capacities and dispositions. All this becomes the more explicit the more con- ceptually selfconscious we are. That is, the more the awareness of the bodily self is deepened and supplemented by the consciousness of what are usually spoken of as mental operations and moral decisions. My argument is that the organism is the substantial and active self so known. It is surely not surprising that a self which feels itself con- tinuous with muscular sensations and able to control their coming through imaged decisions should interpret kinaesthetic sensations symbolically as effort and resistance. We regard our muscular activity as an extension and prolongation of the activity of the self even though we detect no connective bond between decision and the later kinaesthetic sensation. Self-knowledge is not com- plete physiological knowledge, though it should not conflict with it. And I see no reason to deny that imaged decisions do control muscular movements. In other words, Hume demanded too much. What alone I am arguing for is the growth of the categorial mean- ing of causality within experience as tied up with the awareness of the self as active and controlling, on the one hand, and as suffering and being controlled, on the other. All this seems to me to emerge in the setting of self and things. I do not see how sensationalism as such could give a nucleus for the development of such intertwined categorial meanings. Under these conditions it is not surprising that muscular sensa- tions become, as I said, symbolic of action, passion, and direction, both spatial and temporal. In this fashion causality gets its extra- bodily extension and application. I learn that I can not only move my body but the things around it. And I soon learn instrumental routines outside the organic self which I can set going. Laws of nature are in the offing. I have suggested that kinaesthetic sensations and even feelings take on causal symbolism and give solidity and volume to our thought of causal operations. So far as I can see, they do not do</page><page sequence="15">No. i.] CAUSALITY AND SUBSTANCE I5 more than this but readily become indicative of the measurements of effort and resistance attached to them by science. It is merely another case of our sensations becoming symbolic through their integration with categorial meanings. Just as I tend to take a colored patch to be the surface of the thing to which I am at- tending and toward which I am moving, so I take the muscular sensations as expressing my causal effort. In neither case does a critical level of knowing project sensory qualities into things. These must find a locus in the self as organism; and that, as we saw, is the mind-body problem. Now the import of my whole argument is to the effect that the categorial meanings of substance and causality develop together in connection with the awareness of self and things. Such is their setting; and conceptual apprehension of the categories should not violate this mutual involvement. If philosophy violates this setting, substance becomes inert, merely linguistic, and mythological, a parody for positivists to scorn; and causality, abstracted from it, likewise turns into something unempirical and undiscoverable. Both epistemic and epistemological acumen are needed to handle categories. V Let us apply these conclusions to Humianism or what I have called phenomenalistic empiricism. It is obvious that I have been seeking to push beyond Kant's compromise answer to Hume. Kant knew we employed-categories, but he did not trace their epistemic source to categorial meanings emerging in sense-perception and self-awareness. As I see it, both his psychology and his episte- mology were inadequate. And yet he was so clearly on the right track. Our thinking is dominated by these categories. All we need to do essentially is to realize that conceptual thinking of this sort arises upon the apprehension of categorial meanings developed in the operations of sense-perception and self-awareness. The further epistemological task is to elicit a denotative realism which moves from naive to critical realism. Phenomenalism then gives way to a physical realism with the apprehended categories rightly applied to existence. A basic ontological question arises at this point and must at least be mentioned. Hume rightly saw that the idea of existence</page><page sequence="16">i6 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. LII. must take its departure from actual existence, in his case from impressions and ideas. I should suppose that existence is here of the nature of an acknowledgment arising from .the recognition of the contrast between presence and absence. It is a notorious fact that people whose organic sensations are strongly modified get a feeling of unreality, of nonexistence. I am strongly of the opinion, then, that in psychical matters the assertion of existence is tautological. Existence is not a property of such an event but is the event itself. And as we note the sensa-. tion, or the feeling, fading we become conscious of something ceasing or going out of existence. But, as a realist, I am of the opinion that we have in this case to do with events which must ultimately be conceived as activities of the organic self. Let us, therefore, try to understand what existence means as applied to the self and to external things. I take it to be evident that, just as the category of substance applies to both, so will the meaning of existence. Now in self-awareness we think the self as that which discloses itself in such subjective experiences as feeling-attitude, desire, and moral decision, and at the same time expresses itself in such experiences. The result is that existence is automatically assigned to the self as inclusive of them. To say the self exists is to say that it is continuous with these subjective experiences. But that is not all, for the self has a different categorial status from them. It is an object of knowledge which is regarded as enduring, active, and the subject of capacities, habits, and aptitudes. The self for each knower has the special status of being continuous with the subjective experiences which form the point of departure for self-awareness, so that self- knowledge cannot be an affair of hallucination, even though ele- ments of illusion may enter. This situation it is that helps to make reflexive knowledge or self-knowledge possible. I know myself; and in this fact I cannot be mistaken though I may be mistaken in the particular specific concepts used. We have, I hold, valid re- flexive knowledge of the self. But into the details of self-knowledge I cannot here enter. Suffice it to say that the self is sensuously known through subjective experiences which are intrinsic to the activities of the organic self and in a more conceptual way through concepts based on</page><page sequence="17">No. i.] CAUSALITY AND SUBSTANCE I7 categorial meanings. The result is that the concept of existence emerges from these categorial meanings to adjust itself to sub- stance. It is the very nature of things and selves to exist unless they cease to exist. To assign existence to them is tautological. The problem is not to find existence but what exists. And one point of departure for each one is the organic self sensuously known through subjective experiences. Here, again, the primary task was to raise Hume to the level of denotative realism. For Kant this position signifies that the sharp distinction between the empirical self and the transcendental ego breaks down just as that between the phenomenon and the thing- in-self does. Had Descartes not been so certain that mind and matter are alien to each other, his analysis might well have been similar. We must give a nod at least in the direction of external existence. It is obvious that we must distinguish between the grounds for our belief in external things and the question of the kind of existence we assign them. Even idealists are not solipsists. And yet the two problems are intertwined. The main grounds for external existence are those operating in sense-perception and in overt action involving handling and pushing and being pushed. Once begun, these motives are supple- mented by conceptual thought, which explains intercourse, travel, communication, events, etc., in terms of a physical world. But it seems to me quite clear that the categorial meaning stems pri- mordially from the consciousness of being affected in sense- perception and in the complex experiences of doing and suffering. The critical realist argues that, in sense-perception, sensations are used as natural signs of objects because of the reaction of the organic self to and through these sensations. Introspection can, I think, note the feeling of being startled in the case of unexpected and intense sensations. In sense-perception there is an integration of this feeling of being affected with the supplementary factor of felt attitude and response. The process of interpretation adds itself in terms of memories and expectations and, I have argued, the self thus denotes a counterexistent with which it feels itself to be confronted. Judgment and its asserted facts flow in to build upon this inception. Now, as I see it, the generic kind of existence as-</page><page sequence="18">i8 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. LII. signed to these counterexistents is substantive and like that of the organic self. It is in terms of this thick perceptual form with its categorial meanings that visual and tactile sensations tend to be regarded as helping to constitute the very surfaces of objects. Their marginal status with respect to the subjective experiences which chiefly dominate self-awareness and their function as guides to attitude and behavior assist in the development of this interpretation which gives rise to naive realism. It is as though the very existence of the external thing were given. There are all sorts of gradations as in hearing, smelling, and tasting. But the general mechanism is of the sort indicated. Another relevant topic is that of the quid juris of the external application of the categories of substance, causality, and existence, what Kant called the transcendental deduction. The divergence between Kantianism and critical realism on this point turns around the identification by the latter of thing with thing-in-itself and of empirical self with the transcendental self. We should not speak of phenomenal objects and phenomenal selves. And it is im- portant to note that these categories arise from, and are demanded by, the organic self. The alternative here is, so far as I can see, a wilful agnosticism, or phenomenalism, which refuses to do justice to our actual knowledge-claims. Kant undertook to show that without these categories science would be impossible. I would also add common sense to science. Both our cognitive forms and our action presuppose them. And I see no reason to believe that our categories are arbitrary. Instead I have attempted to show that they are conceptualizations of cate- gorial meanings which clearly have an empirical and existential origin. In the manner indicated above we do extrapolate them. And the more we integrate the self with the organism-an identification which, in my opinion, the recognition of the social expansion of the concept of the self does not militate against-the more inevi- table such extrapolation seems, since the existential extension is from the organism to its environment. It is a fact that we tend to regard ourselves as causal substances within a more inclusive world. This mode of thought is, according to the argument devel- oped here, both natural and rational and does not, contrary to</page><page sequence="19">No. i.] CAUSALITY AND SUBSTANCE '9 Kant, meet with antinomies. The alternative would seem to be such categoriless perspectives as positivism and pragmatism, which rest mainly upon a kind of stubborn rejection of epistemological and ontological analysis, a rejection motivated by certain phobias, loyalties, and inadequate concepts. There can be little doubt that Cartesian dualism with its sup- posed intuition that body could not think had something to do with the burden of this extrapolation-problem. With the recognition of the artificiality of Cartesian dualism it becomes natural to extend categories beyond man just because we now think of him as continuous with nature. And, in so doing, we affirm in a more sophisticated way what man has always done and what philosophy had done from Aristotle to Kant. However, due attention must be given to the idea of levels of causality and substance in order to escape false anthropomorphism. There are clearly evolved kinds of substances with emergent causal modes. Again, man should not expect to intuit causal routines outside himself but must develop and apply criteria. And this is but what science does. In concluding this epistemological section I would stress the thesis that the principle of causality makes the discovered routines in nature rationally comprehensible and gives a foundation to induction. And it is important to connect causality with substance in order to deepen the latter by absorbing processes, activities, powers, and potentialities. Only in this fashion can a basis be given to the nomic form "would be q if it were p" as against the purely factual form "is q if p". VI I shall now pass to a study of the categorial setting of science. What I shall be primarily concerned with will be a grounding of scientific concepts in ontological ones under the guidance of the above epistemological and ontological analyses. The category of substantivity has no similitude to the pictorial eleatic conception of matter of the nineteenth century. W\Ve must recognize that our knowledge of physical entities is very abstract; and yet that there is nothing in its texture which conflicts with duration and agency and extensity, primary requirements of sub- stantivity. It is in terms of these requirements that scientific con-</page><page sequence="20">20 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. LII. cepts of space, time, quantity, and causality, can be rationally understood and what I have called their descriptive spreading out comprehended. Duration and agency disclose themselves in our experience in terms of time. And the operations of remembering, anticipating, and dating, spread out our knowledge of events, which are cognized facts about activities in nature. We recognize that events are not themselves realities but presuppose the agency, or activity, of that which durationally exists. Many of the para- doxes of time could have been avoided had this ontological basis for time been grasped. The present in contrast to the past and the future is only more actual in the sense that it refers to the actual activities of enduring substances. It does not then mean a stretch of time but the source and basis of time. Such is the only meaning I can give to the haunting sense of an absolute now. Does it not express our belief that the universe, as substantial, is a field of coexistential activities? But science develops concepts in relation to techniques of measurement; and so scientific time without a categorial setting has no meaning to assign to absolute simultaneity. The theory of relativity expresses the discovery of this fact. This analysis illustrates what I mean by a philosophic supplementation of science by giving it a categorial setting. Now much the same sort of operation must be applied to cau- sality, as used in science, to make it ontologically adequate. It is clear that the past cannot push the present, rather that the activity of an agent in its relation or field brings something to pass. Moral decision does not represent a push from a no-longer-existing past. It is an act of self-decision, of moral agency. We must be on our guard, as I have indicated, against a static epistemic spread or else we confuse knowledge with being. What, then, do causal laws mean? Factually, a routine in nature; comically, the potency for a determinate kind of activity. Developments in modern physics are obviously away from eleaticism and from the kind of transeunt causality characteristic of the so-called mechanical view of the world. In field-theory transeunt causality seems to me to be a phase of the immanent causality of the field. And yet physical substances, such as electrons and protons, indicate a center of activity of a dominantly relational sort. It is only as these combine to secure a new wholeness and</page><page sequence="21">No. i.] CAUSALITY AND SUBSTANCE 2I substantiality that immanent causality begins to emerge as some- thing more localized and specific to be set over against transeunt causality. In a very real sense these become correlatives. It is at the level of atoms and molecules that the idea of emer- gence gains its first definite applicability, though there are hints in physics of the emergence of matter from energy. But what is really implied by emergence? Surely, in order to become rational, it must secure an ontological status and be linked with substance and causality. To me it seems most plausible to connect it, as evolu- tionary naturalism does, not with natural piety but with causality. The fact of emergence must be explained in terms of the synthetic rise of higher-order substances or functionally unified continuants. We must take relations and organization seriously as characteristics of nature. What Professor Savery calls concatenism, which is a kind of effective togetherness, gives a better categorial context than does the atomism of purely external relations, whatever the latter may mean. Suppose we put it in this fashion: emergence is an expression of an emergent causality which should be conceived as an activity of synthesizing upon the basis of a prior level of transeunt and immanent causality. As a term it points to the transition from transeunt to immanent causality, for it refers to the operations which make possible a higher level of substance and immanent causality. It is concerned with the genesis of what Locke called "real essences" and I would prefer to call complex constitutions. Transeunt causality involves a receiving from outside, immanent causality an activity dominantly internal, emergent causality the process of integration into a new whole. There is, so far as I can see, nothing mysterious and unfactual about such an interpretation. What follows? The Aristotelian must relinquish his fixed natural kinds and his eternal forms together with his vitalistic apparatus of potency and act. Activity must be intrinsic to a substance as a whole and not to some postulated factor in it. And it must pass along the lines of relations and organization. It is foolish to create abstract called universals and then seek to project them into na- ture. The ratio essendi is the reverse. Ross suggests that Aristotle was moving in a more Ionic direction in the later books of his Metaphysics. I think he would have moved still further in that</page><page sequence="22">22 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. LII. direction were it not for his teleological astronomy and his un- willingness to think in evolutionary terms. What we need to- day is a materialization of Aristotelianism. I shall have something more to say about this when I come to discuss functional teleology. It was along these lines I was thinking in Evolutionary Nat- uralism. With all due respect for those great thinkers, Lloyd Mor- gan and S. Alexander, it has been my conviction that the first was too phenomenalistic in his epistemology and so was induced to fall back in his ontology on an Activity with a capital A. Sub- stantialism would have avoided this separation. Activity would have been of the material substances themselves. And emergence could not escape a mysterious air in S. Alexander just because he had no substance in which emergent causality could operate. New qualities just emerged as factually as new colors apparently quiver into being in the sky. No; I believe that empirical realism and evolutionary substantialism alone show promise of making the idea of emergence rational. It is clear that the fact of emergence must be distinguished from the ground of emergence much as the fact of evolution is dis- tinguishable from the method of evolution. And here it seems to me that two basic points must be noted. The first may be stated thus: New properties do not emerge; what emerges are new sub- stances. The second point concerns the kind of unity brought about by emergent causality and finding expression in immanent causality. Strictly speaking, of course, properties do not emerge; it is the newly constituted substance which does so. Properties are not adjectival entities which float around mysteriously or come from nowhere in a mysterious fashion, nor are they. entities stuck on to an inert substratum as Locke at his worst suggested. Properties are laws to the effect that, if certain conditions be fulfilled, certain facts can be noted. Thus water is such that it will boil under specified conditions. Science seeks to understand such a property by attention to the energy-structure of the molecule. Properties must express the constitution of the substance or complex of substances of which they are properties. Locke, quite obviously, had something like this in mind when he talked of real essences.</page><page sequence="23">No. i.] CAUSALITY AND SUBSTANCE 23 His epistemology was not realistic enough and his ontology too obscure. What, then, shall we mean by the constitution of a substance? It is clearly something which can emerge through that kind of activity we have called emergent causality. In one direction it points toward genetic potentialities; in the other, toward a unified, or concatenated, togetherness. The active economy of a substance expresses its constitution; and its constitution depends upon the unified togetherness of its constituents. Once grant an active, or dynamic, nature to substance and it follows that we must think in terms of equilibria, wholeness, and dominance. As I see it, immanent causality must be correlated with a type of togetherness in which causality is in some degree under the control of the constitution of a substance. In this situation a part- whole relation is asymmetrical with a whole-part relation. There is, so far as I can see, no a priori way of determining the tightness of the unity involved in higher-order substances. The economy here is so definitely temporal as well as spatial. It is interesting to note that what is apparent at the level of organisms has been shown by physics to apply, in terms of included rhythms, to the microscopic world. Such an outlook signifies the inseparability of activity and duration in substance. And we should expect that a higher-order substance would have rhythms of a longer temporal span than the included ones. How could it be otherwise? To deny it would be to deny the existence of the constituted unity of the new whole. What I am driving at is that a higher-order substance must have both spatial and temporal unity. Without both we would have but atomism. Another point: the temporal unity is inseparable from the spatial constitution, and the spatial constitution, not being inert, depends upon the temporal rhythms. Only as space and time are taken in this fashion are they compatible with the underlying durational activity of a substance. The general economy of a substance demands the essential inseparability of structure and function. It seems that biologists have long realized this fact, which, I think, must be extended downward to simpler substances. Here, again, I would suggest that ontology throws light upon, and supplements, epistemology. To the extent that science neg-</page><page sequence="24">24 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. LII. lects the categorial setting of its facts it is in danger of a thinness in its interpretation. Its theoretical structure is unable to give meaning to its facts. A materialistic substantialist like myself feels that scientific knowledge about substances in their relations gets added meaning when we grasp it as knowledge about the econo- mies of such substances in their spatial and temporal dimensions. In the strict sense physical time is always local and reflects a dura- tional rhythm. And such rhythm is determined by the economy and constitution of the enduring substance. Such is the source and basis of time. Only by such an approach can, it seems to me, the traditional paradoxes be escaped. We get a sense of on-moving durational activity unattainable by mere eventism. VII Materialistic substantialism differs from Aristotelian substan- tialism in its stress upon relations, upon emergence, and upon en- during constitution. It does not look upon form as either artistically imposed or vitalistically presupposed. Hence it is more Ionic and refuses to dichotomize a substance into form and matter, actuality and potency. And yet it is grateful to the Stagirite for the sugges- tive handling of change and continuity. I take it, also, that only in terms of enduring substances with dynamic constitutions ex- pressible in economies can we understand powers, aptitudes, habits, and dispositions. All this becomes empirical and obvious at the level of human beings. To human nature, or the constitution of human beings, belong powers and aptitudes. And so complex is its economy that aptitudes may remain latent or may be developed. Again, the direction of the economy of a human being may activate a disposition or leave it dormant. Only in terms of emergence and complexification can this be understood. The self is no simple thing but involves an involution of organization within organiza- tion. Both external and internal knowledge indicate such a compli- cated pattern of endurance. For any emergent view consciousness or togetherness-in-expe- riencing is of critical importance. This primary fact must be approached both genetically and functionally. The functional interpretation, while tremendously significant, does not seem to me particularly baffling. From this point of view</page><page sequence="25">No. i.] CAUSALITY AND SUBSTANCE 25 consciousness must be conceived as a qualitative dimension of the activity of the self expressive of, and significant for, the func- tional togetherness of the brain-mind. It would seem that here- and here alone-do we have empirical verification of functional wholeness. At least, this is the case if we take James's introspec- tion as truer than Hume's form of mental atomism. And I take it that psychology has been moving in this direction. Since emergent causality implies both substantial and functional wholeness, we have here a confirmation of the theory. And, as I have so fre- quently pointed out, here by the very nature of the situation can the individual have some measure of inside information about a high-level substance. There is nothing about external knowledge, which is very abstract and descriptive, which conflicts with this quite obvious fact. I feel that consciousness must be correlated with the activity of a very complicated and enduring substance. It is for this reason that we all tend to think of it as an illumination rather than as a substance. Here we have a basic categorial prob- lem. It is intrinsic to an activity and is isomorphic with it; but the activity is itself an expression of the activated substance. It is the old question of the inseparability of structure and function in the economy of any system. It is my opinion that we must take endurance and accumulation seriously and always regard the mind-brain as that which furnishes the matrix and medium of consciousness. In this fashion I am too much of a substantialist to be a panpsychist. The genetic, or evolutionary, approach to the fact of conscious- ness turns for me on the above status of consciousness. Quite clearly, it is to be correlated with rather complicated functions. And it is something which appears and disappears with the passage from latency to activation. By its very nature we have nothing to contrast it with. It stands to me as an indication that being always has an intrinsic nature, that it is not qualitatively vacuous, to use Whitehead's term. The best our reason can do-it seems to me-is to ground consciousness in this basic qualitativeness of all substance. Here is its emergent potentiality. We cannot inspectively trace it in a genetic way, for the last term alone is open to in- spection. But I can see no reason to assume a complete discon- tinuity. Consciousness, as I see it, is adjectival, expressive, intrinsic</page><page sequence="26">26 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. LIT. to functional activity. If emergent causality signifies the generation of higher-order substances we must expect basic novelties. I must turn in conclusion to the question of teleology. My logical path is already indicated. An enduring wholeness with an immanent causal economy implies the rejection of eleatic mechanism. Science is already moving away from pictorial notions based on molar happenings. The field, relations, tensions, equilibria, become rele- vant terms. But evolutionary substantialism would emphasize im- manent causality as the locus of anything akin to purpose. It is important to get rid of dominance by mensurational time and to stress what I have called the source and basis of time. The more there is of immanent causality, the more important in the economy becomes functioning and its expression, order. It will be recalled that I asserted that all agency is durational like substance itself; that is, there are no mathematical instants in nature, no such existential discontinuity as Descartes supposed. It follows that any subsystem has its native durational rhythm. Wholeness must be conceived as temporal as well as spatial. The nature of a high-order substance involves activities so related that one spreads into another. It is this ordered packing of tendencies, habits and dispositions like an organic spring that accounts for ordered and integrated behavior. Purpose can be understood only on the back- ground of durational organization. Events flow out from such an economy much as music takes its origin from a record, only here the connection is brought about externally by means of a needle sliding from one indentation to another. What I am arguing for is a teleology of self-direction rather than a teleology of finalist, a teleology intrinsic to an economy which is both spatial and temporal. In such immanent causality traditional ideas of pushes from the past or pulls from the future are transcended. A high-order substance makes its own time in terms of its economy. In all this I am not forgetting that such immanent causality must be adjusted to the play of transeunt causality, for the organism must act in relation to its environment. But to the extent there is self-direction there is escape from blind- ness and chance. As I see it, the brain-mind is an organ for the highest type of self-direction.</page><page sequence="27">No. i.] CAUSALITY AND SUBSTANCE 27 Let me now state in conclusion some of the principles which any philosophy of nature should explore: (I) The category of causality must be put in its ontological context, which is that of substantive being both endurant and spatial. (2) Properly understood, categories involve one another. (3) Aristotelianism must be profoundly modified by a shift which replaces a vitalistic form by an immanent organization. (4) Realistic empiricism with the recognition of categorial meanings represents a more adequate epistemology than phenom- enalistic empiricism. (5) Relativity is epistemic and not ontological. (6) The basis and source of time is activity within and between enduring substances. (7) There are three main types of causality, transeunt, emer- gent, and immanent. (8) Properties by themselves do not emerge but higher-order substances do. (9) Consciousness is the only "natural isolate" we can be acquainted with. It shows that being has a qualitative dimension. (io) Immanent causality is self-directional. Mind is the high- est level of such functional, self-directional teleology. RoY WOOD SELLARS THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN</page></plain_text>
