Fieldwork in Malitbog was supported in 1955-1960 by the Asia Foundation and the National Research Council of the Philip- pines and in 1964 by the Community Develop- ment Research Council of the University of the Philippines. I wish to express here my sincere gratitude to National Museum Director Galo B. Ocampo for his dynamic support of this proiect and for his extensive assistance during the prepara- tion of this paper. The long hours of stimulating discussions with my colleagues at the Anthro- pology Division, National Museum, Robert B. Fox, Fred Evangelista, and Avelino Legaspi, proved helpful in shaping many of my views. To this group I wish to acknowledge my in- debtedness. My students also deserve my thanks and apologies for making them the testing "ground" for my various ideas incomporated in this paper. Whatever this study merits, I owe it to them; its shortcomings are purely mine. version and the patterning of Christian experience in barrio Malitbog ( a pseu- donym) in central Panay, Philippines.1 To date, there are three religious systems existing in the barrio. These are the tradi- tional religion, Roman Catholicism, and Protestantism. Malitbog traditional religion consti- tutes the basic framework of the local belief system. It has persisted through time, side by side with the other two religious organizations, without losing much of its identity. In fact, many of the people's activities in the barrio today are still defined in its context. Roman Catho- licism came into the area with the arrival of the Spaniards in 1569 and Protestantism 1 The names of places and persons in this paper have been changed in deference to my informants who requested to remain unidentified.</page><page sequence="2">APRIL, 1965 97 with the Americans in 1900. The former "filtered" into Malitbog, so to speak, in- directly through Filipino layworkers. Even during the early days of conversion the people did not have intensive contacts with Spanish missionaries in as much as the missionaries stayed in the large towns. The present generation, therefore, inhe- rited what might be described as a tho- roughly modified version of Roman Catholi- cism.2 On the other hand, Protestantism was introduced by both American and Filipino missionaries who personally came to the barrio "to preach the gospel of Christ to the people." The people of Ma- litbog, therefore, had direct and intensive contact with Protestant missionaries and consequently the religious orientation they received was an unmodified version of Protestant Christianity. The problem of the present discus- sion may, therefore, be phrased in the following questions: How is it possible for the people in Malitbog to accept Christianity and yet retain intact their in- digenous religious beliefs and practices? Why did not the introduction of new reli- gious ideas and the concomitant reorga- nization of the ritual of worship bring about substantial changes in the tradition- al belief system so as to allow the full articulation of these new religious orienta- tions? Has traditional religious structure any bearing on the process of conversion and the patterning of Christian experience in Malitbog? It must be said at the out- set that many of the former Roman Catho- lics who were converted to Protestantism have recently returned to the Roman Catholic Church. What are the factors responsible for this phenomena? What are 2 That is, the new doctrine was received and reworked to suit local ways of believing, thinking, and doing things. Cf. Robert B. Fox, "Pre-Spanish Influence in Filipino Culture," ST M Special Issue on Foundations of Filipino Culture (February 2, 1958), pp. 2-4, Frank Lynch, "Organized Religion in the Philippines" in Fred Eggan, et al (eds), The Philippines (New Haven, Conn.: HRAF, 1956), pp. 471- 744. the mechanisms which prevented the in- corporation of Protestantism into the exist- ing body of customs and traditions that once accepted it? Why did the people re-embrace Roman Catholicism after they had rejected it in favor of the Protes- tant faith? Is it possible to discover the rationale underlying this shift from one religious orientation to another? In approaching this problem, the fol- lowing procedure has been adopted: the first part of this study describes the set- ting; the second part presents a discus- sion of religious change and its implica- tions for the lifeways of the people; and the third part offers a preliminary inter- pretation of the data. It must be borne in mind that unless otherwise indicated all general comments in this paper refer to social phenomena obtaining in Ma- litbog from 1955 to 1964 and to events suggested by available historical docu- ments. Also our analysis and interpreta- tion of facts must be considered provoca- tive rather than conclusive; they are de- signed to provoke thought and not to pro- vide answers for the problem of conver- sion and the patterning of Christian expe- rience in Malitbog. The Setting: Barrio Malitbog Malitbog is one of the small, rural communities in central Panay. It is located at the foot of the mountain range which runs through the island from north to south. It is about twenty-five kilometers away from the town of Calinog and about fifty kilometers from the poblacion of Tapaz, the municipality to which the barrio politically belongs. Topographically, Malitbog is never broad at any point. It has no flat area wider than about five hectares. It consists mainly of highlands, which include moun- tain peaks, steep scarps, and rolling hills - all of which taper toward the plains of Uoilo province. It is on top of these</page><page sequence="3">98 PHILIPPINE SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW rolling hills and on the shoulders of these mountain spurs that the majority of the inhabitants of Malitbog reside. Culturally, Malitbog is marginal to both the highland Sulod3 and the low- land inhabitants of Tapaz and Calinog. The mountain Sulod consider Malitbog a lowland village but the people from the poblacion consider it a mountain commu- nity. The latter's view is supported, in part, by the fact that the barrio is located at the foot of tall mountain ridges and can be seen, because of elevation, from the plains below. Malitbog has a population of about 608 people. This number covers the total barrio membership coming from 97 house- hold units scattered all over the place. The average size of each family unit is from 5 to 8, mostly children. Malitbog farmers favor large families and the com- ing of each child is considered a "sign" of good luck. This attitude has developed apparently from group consensus that a child, when grown up, means an addi- tional hand on the farm, another source from which to supply the family larder. This seems ironic, however, in view of the fact that many Malitbog youth move out of the barrio. Those who stay marry young and establish their own families of pro- creation, independently of their respective families of orientation. The people of Malitbog are closely at- tached to their community and they are very sensitive about this identity. Any mischief or scandalous act is immediately sanctioned by the group because "it will bring a bad name (reputation) to the bar- rio." The evaluation of people from other barrios of the character of Malitbog is also of primary importance to them. As many of my informants say, "We do not want other people to think that we are all mountaineers or bandits because we live near the slopes of the mountain." This sensitivity against outside opinion is equalled by the manner in which the people rate themselves in comparison with those living in the neighboring barrios. Thus, the character of any newcomer to the area is evaluated in terms of where he comes from. This evaluative nature of the Malitbog attitude implies a highly centralized com- munity structure. It also implies accep- tance of common values involving concern over activities and problems of the people in one's immediate neighborhood. Every event is regarded as a common enterprise and everybody is free to comment upon it. Any criticism made on almost anything is not done by an individual or groups of individuals but by the entire community. This has given rise to strong public opi- nion. This closely-knit pattern of relations obtaining in Malitbog brings us to another dimension of barrio life. And this is the internal structure of local social identity. The barrio is divided into three sitios and the people establish their identity within the community relative to these places. The sitio may be defined as a spatial unit within the broader geograph- ical dimension of the barrio. Its boun- daries are well-defined. Insofar as the members are concerned, it is the locality in which they live. It is, moreover, the society within which the greater part of their lives is spent. Here most of their basic needs are met because it is here that most of their close relatives and friends reside. The focal point of social interaction in the sitio is normally the coconut groves where men congregate in the evenings to drink tuba 4 and to talk about community affairs; the other is the 3 F.

D. dissertation, Department of Anthropology, Uni- versity of Chicago, 1963). 4 Local beverage derived from the sap of coconut inflorescence.</page><page sequence="4">APRIL, 1965 99 barrio well where women gather to wash in the mornings and also to talk about local happenings. There are no variety or sari sari stores in Malitbog which can provide a common place for special in- teractions. The church is the only public place where most people come together during Sundays but social interactions here involve pan-barrio activities with re- ligious overtones. Sociologically, sitio sentiments involve variables other than physical proximity. Preparations for activities associated with weddings, religious rituals, ball games, and others usually involve members of the sitio. People from neighboring sitios may come but they are regarded as guests. When these activities, mentioned above, become barrio affairs, sitio-members tend to stay in separate groups, thus retaining their local identities. Labor for building a house, for agricultural pursuits, and for other needs is recruited from sitio-mem- bers. Collection of barrio contributions for pan-barrio affairs or of barrio contribu- tions to the town fiesta are adjusted to the size of the sitios and each sitio is responsible for meeting its quota. Mem- bers of the barrio council are also drawn from the three sitios. In a word, local sentiments in the barrio normally grow out of sitio attach- ments which serve as the people's points of reference in evaluating and judging other people. Here Malitbog culture devel- ops and manifests itself. Traditional Religion As far as it can be reconstructed from current religious practices in the barrio, from memories of older members of the group, and from data provided by studies of the neighboring mountain people, tradi- tional religion in Malitbog has had almost the same structure in the past that it has today. It has resisted acculturation. Struc- turally, it remains built around the belief in the continuance of relationships be- tween the living and the spirits of the dead, and in the existence of a myriad of environmental spirits which have influence over the affairs of men. This belief finds support in the dominant and pervasive influence of local religion on the dailv life of the people. In fact, religion is so interwoven with Malitbog lifeways that it is difficult to distinguish what is social and what is religious in the people's daily activities. Every activity that an indivi- dual undertakes, be it in agriculture, fish- ing, hunting, or otherwise, is always in consultation with the environmental spirits and deified souls of departed ancestors. Thus no one ordinarily attempts anything which might displease the spirits. On the contrary, one does everything within his power to please these environmental spirits and deified souls even if he becomes in- debted for life in order to celebrate the proper ceremony for these supernatural beings. Most ceremonies are familial affairs. The performance of any rite is primarily motivated by the desire to promote the welfare óf the members of the family. For example, in rituals associated with agriculture, the environmental spirits are called upon to protect not only the crops but also the members of the performer's family. The same principle underlies other ceremonies, performed in private by indi- vidual family-heads or done in public and participated in by the entire community or a greater portion of the community. This relationship between the spirits of the dead, the environmental spirits and the elementary family, as represented by the officiant who is generally the family- head himself, is clearly embodied in ce- remonies connected with the cult of the supernatural. Introduction of Change: Roman Catholicism As we have indicated earlier, Roman Catholicism was brought to Panay by</page><page sequence="5">100 PHILIPPINE SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW Spanish missionaries as early as the late 16th century. However, its impact was not felt in the central area, where Malitbog is located, until 1763 when the pueblo of Calinog was founded. During this period, the "religious center" in Calinog had the status of a bisita (Sp. visita) attached to the parish of the neighboring town of Passi. Nevertheless proselytizing began. With the construction of the church in the poblacion of Calinog in 1810, the bisita became an independent church. Conver- sion to Roman Catholicism took place quickly. Force was used, especially during the building of the church, to bring the people under the influence of the new faith. Preaching was normally an attack on the "sinful" ways of the people. The fear of hell, and the promise of eternal life in heaven were the motives used to attract people to the teaching of the new religion.5 Because of the cruelty of later Spanish friars and administrators in Calinog, many families moved out from the poblacion and settled in the frontier area near the present site of Malitbog. Here they re- established themselves. Their contacts with the poblacion people were not frequent in that they went to the town only when they needed certain household necessities, and when they visited their relatives in the town during fiestas. In 1844 the parish of Tapaz was founded. This strengthened the position of Roman Catholicism in the area. More people were drawn into the fold of the Catholic Church. When the Americans came in 1900 further changes took place. The American administrators constructed the national road connecting the prov- inces of Capiz and Iloilo. This improved means of transportation brought more Catholic residents into the vicinity of 5 Information about these events has been gathered through interviews with older residents (including retired public officials) in Calinog and Tapaz. Malitbog. This further spread the Roman Catholic faith. Moreover, the pageantry of the rituals associated with the mass and the annual fiesta celebration drew the people to Roman Catholicism. The structure of Roman Catholicism in Malitbog today is similar to that ob- taining in any barrio in the Philippines; hence a detailed description of it is not in order. Suffice it to say that before 1964 Malitbog did not have its own bisita. Therefore the Catholic segment of the population went to either Calinog or Tapaz to attend mass on Sundays and holidays, and for the annual fiestas. Protestantism In 1930 the Baptist Foreign Mission, stationed in Jaro, Iloilo City, sent a mi- nister to establish a rural church in this frontier area. This action marked what was later to become an important event in Malitbog. In those days, houses were scattered throughout the area, often near the hillside where the people had their swidden patches. When the chapel was finally built in the area in 1931, the minis- ter was able to persuade the people to live in one place and to organize them- selves into a barrio. He called this fron- tier community "Katipunan" meaning "coming or living together." By the out- break of the Second World War in 1941 there were more than fifty houses in this new barrio. But as the people continued to clear the surrounding jungle and to farm the rolling hills, many families from this new barrio moved out. They went further up the slopes of the mountains and built their houses there. The problem of persuading the people to attend Sunday services, es- pecially during rainy days, became promi- nent in the minister's mind. So in 1936 he gathered the original five families who left the barrio and were now living in Malitbog around a temporary barrio site.</page><page sequence="6">A PRIL, 1965 101 He also built a small chapel for them. Here the people congregated during Sun- days and holidays. Seminary students from a mission school in Iloilo City visited Ma- litbog regularly during holidays and se- mestral vacations. During these visits, they organized group activities like short plays, adult education classes, prayer meetings and others. They also distributed gifts during Christmas. These frequent social gatherings attracted the people and they came and built their houses near the chapel so that they could participate in church activities without having to walk long distances, especially at night. By the outbreak of the Second World War in 1941, there were more than twenty-five houses constructed near the chapel. Thus, barrio Malitbog came to be organized in the locale where it now stands. When we visited Malitbog for the first time in 1955, the barrio was about 85 per cent Protestant. In 1960 the number of Protestants had so far exceeded the num- ber of Roman Catholics that a new wood- and-concrete Protestant church with a gai- vanized-iron roof was constructed. Be- tween 30 to 50 people attended Sunday services regularly and during special oc- casions the congregation reached about 70 to 100. When I returned to Malitbog in 1964, however, I noted that remarkable changes had occurred in the religious orientation of the people. A number of families had withdrawn their membership from the Protestant Church. Others remained mem- bers but were not active in church activi- ties and many had re-embraced Roman Catholicism. In fact, an ermita (a Catholic chapel) now stands near the barrio pro- per. There was no such structure in 1960 when I left Malitbog. Many elders of the Protestant Church have gone to see the mediums and herbolarios (herb-medical practitioner) for their illnesses, partici- pated in local religious seances, and taken less active interest in church work. Baffled by this problem, the minister asked me: 'Why . . . ?" Preliminary Analysis It is not my intention in this paper to provide answers to the minister's ques- tion. In fact, I will stay away from it. Professional bias often leads to "exper- tizing" and this has to be avoided. All that need be done, at least in this paper, is to indicate sensitive "spots" in the so- cial structure and cultural pattern of Ma- litbog where conflicts arose in the process of introducing religious change in the barrio; and leave to the churchmen, who are more competent in religious matters than I, the decision to either disregard this study or to make use of it for what- ever it is worth. Roman Catholicism When a Roman Catholic in Malitbog is asked what his religion is he replies that he is a Roman Catholic. That means that he has overtly accepted the doctrine, ritual and administrative organization, proposed, approved, or maintained as nor- mative by officially designated authority3 of the Roman Catholic Church. In terms of concrete religious behavior, however, his activities are heavily orient- ed toward the observance of popular be- liefs and practices sanctioned by the com- munity and not necessarily by the Church. In other words, there is a blending of the official Catholic Church doctrines and practices with local ways of thinking, be- lieving, and doing things. For example, there is superimposed upon the vaguely defined concept of Roman Catholicism in the area a highly specialized knowledge about the enkangtu 7 and other environ- mental spirits. In fact Roman Catholic 6 Frank Lynch, op. cit., p. 484. 7 These supernatural beings are more power- ful than any other group of environmental spirits.</page><page sequence="7">102 PHILIPPINE SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW saints are revered in Malitbog not be- cause the Church had canonized them as examples of good work and virtuous living but because they possess powers similar to those of the engkantu and they can be manipulated for personal gain. The follow- ing case study brings this out. Case Study No. 1 B is a mother of nine children. Two days after she delivered her eighth child, she suffered a terrible headache. She thought it was an ordinary headache caused by constipation. She was not able to dispose normally for two days. The following day, however, she had a fever. She chilled intermittently and the color of her skin started to turn yellow. They called the partira (mid- wife) and she diagnosed it as "nasola ka talunanon" (meaning, having been seen by the spirits of the forest during delivery). The baylan was called and she was treated by him. Three days later she became well. Her fever subsided and her skin re- gained its normal color. But she found out that she could not move her left hand and also her left foot. She was paralyzed! Everything was done by the family to cure her. She was brought to a medical doctor, confined in the hos- pital, and anointed by the baylan. But all these efforts were in vain. Three months after her "attack" she could not move her lower extremities. One night she had a dream and in that dream she had a vision in which she was told to go to town and have a mass said. Then she had to make a novena to San Vicente for as long as she was ill. The vision, however, im- posed one other requirement: "she must not tell anyone about this dream except the priest." The following morning she requested her husband and sons to bring her to the poblacion because she would like to make her confession. In church she told the priest about her dream. The priest told her to do exactly what the vision said. He gave her an old statuette of San Vicente which he said he had "blessed with Holy Water." B brought this image home and started the novena right away. After "tatlo ka siyam" (i.e. three sets of nine devotional nights) B noticed that she could move her left arm; then after another "tatlo ka siyam" she was com- pletely healed. A mass of grace (pa- misa de grasya ) was said by the priest who attributed the "miracle" to the powers of San Vicente. Since then San Vicente became the patron saint of the family. When I inter- viewed B and her family, they were having a novena said for the deliver- ance of the soul of their departed kin from purgatory. All of them said that many of their problems were solved and their sickness healed by San Vi- cente. According to the people of Malitbog, knowledge of the powers surrounding the saints and how an individual can avail himself by these powers, belong to the priests. Although the priests may not share this view, the people of Malitbog never- theless look upon them as the key to this unseen source of power and grace and, as such, it is conceived that to insult or harm a priest is to endanger one's life. He is regarded as an embodiment of sacredness, and is capable of cleansing the soul of an individual of all the wrong wrhich may be responsible for his hardship and misfortunes in life. The ritual pre- scription generally consists of confession, communion, praying a penance, lighting a candle before the saint, and paying a certain amount of money to the Church for the mass which the priest says on behalf of the sinner. Not everyone, according to people in Malitbog, can become a priest. Of course it is realized that anyone can study for the priesthood, but if one is not "called upon by God to become a priest" he will become sickly while studying in the semi- nary. In fact he might die of tuberculosis.</page><page sequence="8">APRIL, 1965 103 Some of the character traits indicative of "being called to the priesthood" are being agi-agion (a little effeminate), shy, not talkative, and of good memory. If one has these and other traits, he can withstand the difficulties of seminary training. On the other hand, knowledge con- cerning the engkantu and other environ- mental spirits are known to another group of specialists - the baylan or mediums. They are either men or women who are believed to possess extraordinary powers to cure sickness, to exorcise evil spirits from the ricefields or out of the human body, and to intercede with the good spirits for whatever the people may ask. Not every one can become a medium. Becoming one largely depends upon the choice of the engkantu who have be- friended the candidate. When a man h thus called upon by the spirits to become a medium he undergoes training under the practicing baylan in the area. Then after having learned the rudiments of herb medicine, ritual dances, esoteric chants and magic formulae, he journeys to a near- by cave on a Good Friday ( Viernes Santo) for his charms. These charms are given by the engkantu who inhabit the caves, boulders, springs and underground tun- nels. Case Study No. 2 B is the practicing baylan in a bar- rio. He tells this account of how he received his charms from the engkantu. "When I went to have my pangalap (charms), I went alone. I did not have any assistant with me. Other baylans prefer to have assistants tagging along with them. I went to Hapu-Hapu cave in the mountains of Passi, Iloilo. "When I arrived there, there were already many baylans gathered around the mouth of the cave. I told myself that 'this is no good.' So I slipped out of the group and went into the forest. I walked and kept walking for almost half-a-day. In the evening I came upon a huge boulder at the foot of a tall cliff. "When I went to examine this boul- der I was surprised to see light coming from an opening behind the stone. The opening was very small. I had to squeeze my body in order to get in. "But once inside, I found myself in a big chamber. I thought I was in a church. There were chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. There were saints there too. I looked around. At the altar, which occupied the other end of the chamber, I saw a small plate, on top of which was a small stone. From a distance the stone was not moving, but everytime I came forward to pick it up, it spun so rapidly that I could not catch it. "After several unsuccessful tries, I devised a scheme. I took my red hand- kerchief and wound this around my hands. With this I was able to take hold of the stone but then the light went out. It was so dark that I did not know what happened next. When I woke up I was at the mouth of Pan-ay River in Capiz province. "I was very hungry but I saw no house nearby. No one was living in the place where I was. So to relieve the pain in my stomach I chewed guava leaves. Because I was so tired, I laid down underneath a coconut tree near the bank of the river. I fell asleep. In my sleep I saw a vision - the engkantu - who told me ťNow you can return home. You have my charm. You can go ahead practicing binabaylan (i.e. the art of mediumship).' "That's how I started being a bay- lan." Once the medium has acquired powers from his charms these can be activated either directly for his own interests or on behalf of his patients. He performs all important rituals and chants local prayers for the community when the barrio is faced with crises. Sickness and malignant diseases are first referred to him before these are brought to the attention of medical practitioneers in the poblacion or</page><page sequence="9">104 PHILIPPINE SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW in Iloilo City. The medium is likewise regarded as the only person who can com- municate with the engkantu and thus he merits the respect of the people. To insult or harm a medium is to endanger one's life. To mimic his work is equally fatal as is seen in the following case. Case Study No. 3 M and one of her visiting friends from the city went to witness the per- formance of the sagdahon ceremony. The sagdahon is a ritual done for the spirits of the river whenever a man is seriously ill. When M and her friend came home after the ceremony, they re-enacted, out of fun, the dances and prayers of the baylan. They beat tin-cans and called upon the spirits to come down. The following morning M became mad; she lost her mind. Witnesses re- call how she danced and chanted that sunny morning. No baylan in the area would treat her. They knew that the spirits were angered and "whoever treated the girl would suffer the same fate as she had." M died two weeks later. It can be stated therefore that in spite of the influence of Roman Catholicism, religion in Malitbog remains strongly oriented toward local tradition. For exam- ple, the world of man is generally re- garded as an extension of the spiritual and saintly world. It is accepted that there is an extremely influential spiritual world with a limitless number of powerful and fearsome inhabitants - saints, engkantu, and others - who are apart from the hu- man world but in close relationship with it. These inhabitants of the spirit- world are anthropomorphic beings. Their behavior is patterned after that of human beings. In the popular mind, many of them are envisaged in the guise of ances- tors and culture-heroes, patron saints and guardian spirits. Stories and legends are woven around these personages in order to emphasize their powers and to make effective local sanctions and values. Power- ful as they may be, these supernatural beings, however, are not beyond the power of human blandishment. If rituals are per- formed and masses are said to appease and glorify them, they willingly attend to the welfare of the worshippers. Such a process, as I have already indicated, re- quires a highly specialized body of knowl- edge which is possessed only by priests and mediums. Methods of divination for ascertaining the will of these supernatural beings are also in the hands of those who have specialized knowledge and power. Viewed from their cultural context, both the Roman Catholic Church and the traditional religion in Malitbog can be equated and placed in the same category. I would further suggest that Catholicism as it exists in the barrio today is folk Catholicism. By this I mean that the offi- cial doctrines and practices of the Catholic Church have been modified in order to suit local cultural practices. The priests and the mediums have, for the people of Malitbog, the same function: that is, to intercede for them with the unknown powers for everything they ask. The me- dium sometimes uses Latin prayers or indicates that what he mumbles during the performance of certain rituals are La- tin prayers - because it is conceived that the engkantu speak both the vernacular and the Latin language. The priest, the people of Malitbog say, prays in Latin and that is why he is able to communi- cate with the saints. Saints and engkantu are the same or similar unknown power- ful beings to whom one can appeal for help. It is for this reason that when the medium fails to obtain the desired goal, to cure a lingering illness, the people ap- proach the priest, burn candles before the altar in the Church in the poblacion, and pray to the saints. If these do not work</page><page sequence="10">APRIL, 1965 103 out as expected, they go to the doctors in town, in the city, or elsewhere in the island of Panay. Case Study No. 4 When I met Tio C in 1957 he was suffering from abdominal pain. He was still suffering from the same pain when I saw him early in 1964. His case history reveals the following: (a) he consulted Hugdawan, the medium, about this pain in 1957. Hugdawan diagnosed it as the "working of the engkantu." He was treated by her. He was re- lieved for a while. However, the pain recurred in 1959. (b) he went to see the doctor in Lambunao Hospital and in the Puericulture Center in Calinog. It was diagnosed by the doctors as hernia. He was given some medicine to relieve the pain and was advised to buy and use a supporter. He followed the instruction. (c) when he joined the Bureau of Forestry, he suffered a relapse of the pain in 1961. He con- sulted another baylan who diag- nosed it as "caused by the spi- rits of the spring." He was treated by the baylan but he did not become well. (d) he went to see the doctors in Iloilo Provincial Hospital in the summer of 1964. They diag- nosed it as hernia. Again he was given medicine to relieve the pain and was advised to wear a supporter. This he did but the pain was not relieved. (e) recently he wrote that he had just been operated on for a hernia at the Iloilo Mission Hos- pital. Though one might anticipate conflict between the baylan and the priest in the barrio, there has been no apparent strain or conflict existing between these two re- ligious leaders. For one thing, the priest seldom visits the barrio; he stays in the town most of the time and he does not participate in the people's everyday af- fairs, except to say mass during the barrio fiesta. Moreover, the rituals of his Church dovetail with local rituals, structurally and contextually. In fact, his rites are con- sidered by the baylan as more effective in that these "contain" more powerful magic. That is why the baylan often sup- plements his own prayer with Latin pray- ers; and takes his ritual paraphernalia - holy water, the cross, pieces of wood from the santo entero ( Sp. Santo Entierro or "Christ in the Sepulchre") incense and others - from the Church. Case Study No. 5 B, the practicing baylan in the area (see Case Study No. 2), tells me the reason he is the most sought after heal- er in the municipality of Tapaz and Calinog is that he possesses a pangalap (or charm) which draws the people to him. Where he got this pangalap he refused to tell at first. One day we talked about the eng- kantu and how to acquire a pangalap. Unguardedly, he told me that one can get a pangalap from the Santo Entier- ro ("Christ in the Sepulchre"). A piece from this image, taken on Good Fri- day, unnoticed, is a good talisman for fishing and healing; it draws both the fish and the people to the possessor. "You see," he explained, "it is like this. During the Holy Week many people follow the Santo Entierro, right? Because the Santo is blessed with Holy Water, it has powers, right? People wor- ship it. They follow it around the plaza. When you shall have acquired a piece from this blessed object unnoticed, you will acquire its powers - you will be able to draw fish and people to you." An interview with the priest in town confirms this and throws more light on the manner in which this charm from the Santo Entierro is acquired:</page><page sequence="11">106 PHILIPPINE SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW "They (meaning the people) bite parts of the image while pretending to kiss it."

It appears in the final analysis there- fore that the introduction of Roman Ca- tholicism in Malitbog has not led to any substantial shift in the emphasis that is placed on folk beliefs, attitudes and prac- tices. The traditional system of ethics in the barrio, particularly within the sphere of human-superhuman relationships, re- mains deeply embedded in the local cul- ture and even at the popular level of thinking, the numerous sayings, legends, and ritual observances have a strong ef- fect upon the general system of morality. Even exposure to the suburban life of the poblacion, on account of trading in town and going to church on Sundays, has not reduced the significance of local cere- monialism with regard to agricultural;, technological, and social activities in the barrio. This is in part due to the learning process which characterizes the early so- cialization of the child. Although adults observe the Catholic religious practices, the early indoctrination of the child m religious ideas is achieved by means of proverbs, fables, and legends. This results in the widespread use of traditional lore as a guide to morality. Many of these cultural rules are embodied in local ri- tuals. The head of the family will fre- quently make reference to such precepts, even if he quotes wrongly, to instill a sense of obedience in his family. It is difficult to assess the effects of such a practice, but, on the whole, it seems probable that it goes far towards perpe- tuating a traditional Malitbog sense of ethical "oughts" and "ought nots" among the younger generation which in turn passes these concepts to the younger ones by almost the same process. Protestantism If a Protestant is asked what his reli- gion is he replies that he is a portes (vernacular for Protestant). By this he means he is a member of the Protestant group (or is identified with it), irres- pective of whether or not he has been officially accepted by the Church through baptism. His parents or members of his own family (if he is a family-head) may not necessarily be Protestants; he may be the only convert in the kin group. He attends Sunday services, joins in prayer- meetings during Thursday evenings, par- ticipates in home-visits, and in other acti- vities. He openly criticizes the Roman Catholics for their belief in saints, in the Virgin Mother, in confession, in novenas and for having "paganistic" rituals. But it does not take long for an ob- server to realize that what he was told about Protestant behavior does not corres- pond to reality. The views he heard are in the final analysis simply re-statements of universal Protestant Christian ideals learned from the pastor in Sunday school or during home visits. Oftentimes, the philosophy underlying these ideals is not fully comprehended in that they are inter- preted not in terms of Protestant Christian norms but in terms of local social values. Thus, drinking, gambling, swearing, and other so-called "vices" are considered by the people in Malitbog as "necessary trimmings of life." Gambling, let me single out, is conceived by them not as a form of "vice" but as an adult game. This is illustrated by the following case study. Case Study No. 6 Tio C (see Study #4) and I went to visit the pastor. The latter was not at home; he was in the chapel we were told. He was preparing for the coming of student-ministers from a local univer- sity in Iloilo City. So Tio C and I proceeded there.</page><page sequence="12">APRIL, 1965 107 After my interview with the pastor, during which he criticized the people for "continuing their vices, even if they know that these vices are wrong," he turned to Tio C and said, "Here is one of those who does all these kalokohan ( foolishness ) . Ask him and he will agree with you that drinking, cockfighting, and other forms of gambling are wrong. But what he actually does is the reverse of what he is saying." Tio C hedged for awhile. Then he said: "Look at it this way. I will not say these "vices" are right. You, as a pastor, an educated man, know that. But to us here in Malitbog, I do not think these things are vices nor are they as bad as you have described them. These are part of what you are sup- posed to do when you become grown- up. When we were young, our parents admonished us not to drink tuba or any liquor from the Chinese store. These are drinks for adults, we were told. We were supposed to drink soft-drinks and water. But now that we are adults, I do not see any reason why we should not drink tuba. Moreover, let us be practical. If I want my field plowed and I offer no tuba or liquor who will come to help me? No one. Furthermore, if drinking is bad, why doesn't the Government prohibit the sale of these liquors? Because there is no prohibi- tion, then this is not bad. The Govern- ment is not stupid. "Let us take cockfighting. This is, according to you, a vice; a form of gambling. But doesn't San Pedro bring along with him a cock? He must have have engaged in cockfighting too - and look at him now, he is a saint. Let us be serious. When we were small boys, we played hole-ins, halinsay (jacks), and blowing rubber-bands. What would you think of us if you saw us adults in Malitbog still playing hole-ins or blowing rubber-bands? "What I am trying to say, pastor, is this: each age has its own games - cockfighting and cards are adult games. Each occasion has its own social require- ments. Hospitality and labor in the field require offering of food - and this in- cludes tuba and other drinks. If vou do not offer these things people talk, or in case of work-activity they will not come to help. Do you understand, pastor?" Whether or not the pastor understood what Tio C was trying to point out during this meeting I have no way of knowing because he simply turned his back and continued with his work. But as far as I am concerned, Tio C's views explained to me the manner in which the people in Malitbog dichotomize the ideal pattern of their culture and the actual, behavioral aspects of their social world. Thus, even if they say they accept Protestantism and its norms, they do not articulate these with real life. They continue to drink, gamble, swear, and participate in tradi- tional baylan seances. They are no differ- ent from their Roman Catholic neighbors whom they openly criticize; in fact, the latter are their drinking and gambling partners. The Protestants take active part in local rituals and celebrate the Catholic fiestas as well. As one of my informants said: Case Study No. 7 It is embarrassing not to prepare for the fiesta. Our relatives and friends come. Naturally, we have to entertain them otherwise we are not considered good relatives. Our friends will say we are ko-om (stingy) and this is bad. In time of need, we cannot count on them for assistance. In a word, when asked about his reli- gion a Protestant in Malitbog replies in terms of what a Protestant is supposed to answer; when alone or when partici- pating in group activities, he behaves in terms of what his culture sanctions as normative and not what his Church up- holds as appropriate. In this setting, one may ask: why? Why has not the Pro- testant faith blended effectively with local culture in the manner that Roman Catho- licism has?</page><page sequence="13">108 PHILIPPINE SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW In what follows I shall try to explore some possible factors which might give us better insights into this problem. Prof. J. Leslie Dustan* has defined Protestantism as "that brand of Christian faith which ties man directly to the cur- rent affairs of his daily life." And he goes on to say that as "man's faith finds ex- pression in living, living affects his under- standing of the faith." This philosophy apparently underlies the teachings of Pro- testantism in Malitbog. It has attempted to characterize the people's relation with the Divine in simplified rituals and in activities having to do with current af- fairs in the barrio. Since its organization in 1936, the Church has taken an active part in local social problems. In fact, it was largely due to this participation that the pioneer minister in Malitbog was able to rally the people behind him. - Asked why he became a Protestant, A, one of my key informants, said: Case Study No. 8 Well, everyone was joining this group then ( meaning the Protestant group). Besides the minister helped us acquire our land. He also helped us with many of our problems. It is shame- ful to refuse him after he had done all this for us. Moreover, we do not see anything wrong in this religion. A's viewpoint is shared by many other people in Malitbog. In fact, it is not only in acquiring land but also in helping the people during their respective needs that early workers in the area were able to draw many Malitbog residents to the Protestant Church. The following testi- mony of a retired pastor illustrates this. Case Study No. 9 You see, there were no doctors in town during those days. This was in 1931. When people became sick and 8 J. Leslie Dustan (ed), Protestantism (New York: George Brazilier, 1961), p. 176. their illnesses could not be cured by the herbolario, they came to me. I either gave them first aid, some pills to relieve their fever, or I brought them to the hospital in Iloilo City. If they could not pay their hospitalization, I footed the bills. When the Americans constructed the national road connecting the prov- inces of Capiz and Iloilo, they recruited laborers. Because I could read and write, I was offered a job by the Amer- icans to work as a kapatas (foreman). I accepted the job. I gathered all the men in the barrio and employed them as laborers under my supervision. Thus I was able to provide them with jobs; helped them earn extra money for their families. Because of my good public rela- tions the people developed confidence in me and in my work. They followed what I said. In fact, we built the first chapel here during Sunday afternoons - together. What bothers me now is that they are less active in Church work. Of course, none of the older men argue against me openly. But look how they treat this other minister now. They do not believe in him anymore. I doubt sometimes if they take me as seriously now as they did before. Sociologically, we can infer from these cases that the Protestant faith was not accepted in Malitbog because of the peo- ple's felt need for religious self-expression. Nor did it arise from individual realiza- tion of human inadequacies in the light of the new religious philosophy nor from the redemptive nature of the new faith. Neither did it come from an understand- ing of the new theology. It was, rather born out of gratitude and out of a desire to conform with what other people were doing. As such it had no solid "doctrinal" foundation. For one thing, land is the most im- portant source of security and prestige in the barrio. Its acquisition therefore has the highest motive-value. Even up to the present the people will do everything</page><page sequence="14">APRIL, 1965 109 within their means to either acquire land or to retain that which they already own. Thus when the pastor, in the name of Christian stewardship, helped the people in Malitbog acquire land his act was identified with the new faith he was offering. Mem- bership in his church meant cultivating his friendship and his friendship meant assistance in acquiring this basic source of economic security - land. It was here where faith found expression in a manner of living, and, in due time, this affected the people's understanding of the faith. Of course un- derstanding it in their own terms - and that is, the Church could be a bridge to- wards obtaining social status; a means of moving up the scale of society. In terms of their cultural orientation, the people of Malitbog interpreted the pastor's actions as a favor which needed to be reciprocated. For there exists in Malitbog two cultural principles which underlie the dynamics of social relations - utang nga kabubut-on and utang nga kabaraslan. Utang nga kabubut-on is es- tablished when somebody volunteers as- sistance without being asked. For example, if somebody dies in the community every- body gives assistance to the bereaved family without being asked to do so. To these people, the members of the bereaved family owe an utang nga kabubut-on. If, in the future, anyone of these indivi- duals or of their respective families is in trouble, the bereaved family has to ex- tend assistance to them. If they do not do so they will be sanctioned by the community as "walang utang nga buut" (no debt of heart). It must be pointed out, how- ever, that they are not obligated to recipro- cate the previous deed if they do not like to do so. But because of the binding nature of local norms, expressed in the huya complex, non-reciprocity seldom happens. - On the other hand, utang nga kabaraslan is contracted when a person asks another to do him a favor. This is not voluntary; it is solicited. The duty to reciprocate in this case is obligatory. When the pastor, in an effort to win the goodwill of the people, offered to help them acquire their land, this act fell under the utang nga kabubut- on concept. Thus the people reciprocated his benevolence by accepting his religion. They went to church and allowed them- selves to be baptized. Baptism means being part of the unit - part of that group which enjoyed the solicitous concern of the pastor. Not being identified with the group would mean non-enjoyment of the benefits derived from the friendship of the pastor. So the people read the Bible and attended prayer meetings. These were moreover new ways of doing things; new experiences to be explored. However, when they felt that they had repaid the pastor their utang nga kabubut-on, they gradually became less and less interested in church activities and finally returned to traditional behavior patterns. In cases where reciprocal obligations were estab- lished by utang nga kabaraslan, the people took the pastor's actions to mean that he was in fact repaying them for the favor they had done him in building the church, attending Sunday services, receiving him in their homes, and extending to him the assistance he needed when he first came. Here again we see how cul- ture validates human behavior and, in the case of the people of Malitbog, how it affects their understanding of their newly acquired faith and its corresponding reli- gious obligations, and their evaluation of the minister's motives and actions. Another factor which contributed to the inability of the new faith to be in- tegrated deeply into Malitbog social and cultural system was the manner in which the people were converted. During Evan- gelistic Meetings, the preachers normally capitalize on human emotions to convince the people "to come and stand up for</page><page sequence="15">110 PHILIPPINE SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW Christ." The drama is always impressive. And as I have indicated earlier, the peo- ple of Malitbog are a highly sensitive group. Any careful manipulation of emo- tions in oratory is likely to obtain remark- able results. But as it happened in this barrio, its effect was not an enduring one. After the impact of the sentiment-evoking sermons, the people usually returned to their normal ways of thinking and acting. First, many only half -understood the phi- losophy behind the preaching; and second- ly, they were often swayed merely by the music and the charisma of the preacher's personality. Here is one of the testimo- nies of the people I interviewed. Case Study No. 10 I really did not know anything about the Protestant religion. I had heard about it. My compare invited me to attend the Evangelistic Meeting when the missionaries came. There were American and Filipino speakers. I was deeply touched by one of the speakers. Oh how he spoke. Then there was the music. Oh! how it touched your soul. When the speaker called upon those who would accept Jesus Christ as his personal saviour, I realized how much of a sinner I had been and the pro- mise of salvation drew me toward the altar. I stood up for Jesus Christ. When I was asked if I wanted to be bap- tized, I said, "yes." That was how I became a Portes. But I found out later that my feelings had changed; my enthusiasm died out. Then I began to think. It seems to me that there is no difference between the Catholic and the Protestant religions. They are the same. This man was one of those who were active in church work for a few months after baptism. Later he re-embraced Roman Catholicism. Perhaps the simplification of rites con- nected with Sunday services is another factor which can explain why the Protestant faith in Malitbog cannot maintain the en- thusiasm of the people, after they have been converted. As it stands in the barrio today, the Protestant Church has removed the sentiment-evoking touch of religious mys- ticism in the various rites associated with worship by simplifying them. The use of the vernacular in prayers and sermons has taken away the aura of magic, the subjective appeal of the unknown, so characteristic of traditional religion and of Roman Catholicism. The people now understand the process of bridging the gap between man and his God ; and , there- fore , there is no need for the pastor to help them or of a religion to show them how. I do not maintain from this observa- tion that the people should be kept in ignorance so that they will be eternally religious. It must be remembered that most people in Malitbog are not quite prepared to intellectualize, the way we do, the philosophy of Christianity as em- bodied in the Bible. They are subsistence farmers whose educational background has not gone beyond the sixth grade. Their rational justification for their religious sentiment is dramatized in elaborate rituals associated with folk medicine, planting and harvesting crops, building house, and other individual or group acti- vities. In this setting, the simplification of rituals of worship in Protestant services does not structure the drama of the new faith in terms of people's cultural expe- riences; hence it cannot sustain its ef- fectiveness longer than the duration of Evangelistic Meetings. This is well ex- pressed by the following case study, in- volving a Protestant deaconess who re- embraced Roman Catholicism. Case Study No. 11 C was a church deaconess when I visited Malitbog in 1959. She was con- verted to Protestantism late in 1957. Because of her active work she was elected a deaconess of the church in early 1959. When asked why she be- came Protestant she said she was touched</page><page sequence="16">APRIL, 1965 111 by the song and the preaching of the evangelist during the Evangelistic Meeting which took place in 1957. "Something touched me inside," she said, "and before I knew what it was about, I was standing before the altar. There were many people who came, so I was sure that I was not out of place. When I was asked if I wanted to be baptized, I said, yes. So I was baptized." "And why did you re-embrace Ro- man Catholicism?" I asked. "I am not satisfied with what took place after I was converted to Pro- testantism. I mean with church activi- ties. It demanded so much of my time - anybody's time for that matter. 1 cannot really keep up with the require- ments of the Church: prayer-meetings during Thursday evenings, home-visits during Sunday afternoons and so on. Often we are tired working in the field. And the pastor becomes mad if we cannot attend to all these tasks; he says we are not good church- members." "How about in Roman Catholicism?" "Oh the priest does not have so many restrictions. He lets you alone, that is, to do what you like. He does not come here often and tell you 'don't do that,' 'don't do this,' and so on. He does not live here, you know. But the pastor? He keeps coming to your house calling your attention to what- ever you do. Sometimes, it is embar- rassing because the neighbors talk. They know what you have done because the pastor preaches about them during Sundays." "Does he mention names in the pul- pit?" I asked. "No, but everybody knows you are the target because they know what you have done. They have seen the pastor visiting you more than once." These reactions against Church restric- tions and "being talked about by the neighbors" as a result of church-member- ship and the pastor's Sunday preaching bring us to another point in Malitbog culture which makes conversion super- ficial, if not meaningless, and the pat- terning of Protestant Christian experience in the barrio difficult. It needs to be emphasized that Malitbog does not exist in a vacuum. It is constituted by inter- acting individuals, each of whom possesses personality constructs oriented to what Ward H. Goodenough calls their "pri- vate culture."9 This private culture cor- responds to what social psychologists call "self-image," or "self-identity."10 It is composed of "precepts and concepts, pro- positions and beliefs, values and senti- ments, and principles of action and opera- tional recipes."11 It is through the prism of this construct that an individual de- fines his world, expresses his feelings and makes his judgments. In a word ... A person's conduct tends to be guided, then, not only by actual judg- ments given by others, and by his ex- pectations that similar judgments will continue to be given, but also by his own evaluation and by his recognition óf the validity of how others might judge were they in a position to do so.12 It can be inferred from this observation that any action which an individual does has social and cultural orientations. And since action elements are made manifest by individual actors in a given social and cultural millieu, any change in societal ecology or in cultural environment pre- supposes changes in action processes; and these changes bring about the restructur- ing of individual self-images and of the existing cultural frame of reference if or- dered social life is to be desired. What then is in the structure of the Protestant faith, other than a personalized communion with the Saviour, which can 9 Ward Hunt Goodenough, Cooperation in Change (New York: Russell Sage Foundation, 1963), pp. 272-73. 10 Tamotzu Shibutani, Society and Personal- ity (Englewood Cliffs, N.

What in the Protestant Church can be reworked to dovetail with local norms? What is there in the philosophy of Protestant Christian- ity which can be integrated with the people's social and cultural conceptualiza- tion of what Emile Durkheim calls the "sacred" and the "profane"?13 Or what in the local culture, in the people's per- ceptual world and in their philosophy of life can be restructured to fit into the Protestant Christian ideals? It is tempt- ing to answer: their entire culture - their whole way of life! But this is wishful thinking. I would like to point out that Malitbog traditional religion (or its version of Roman Catho- licism ) constitutes a coherent system of rites and practices on the levels both of thought and action, and as social insti- tutions they have important implications for the life of the community. It is true, as I have indicated earlier, that the Bible is translated and its teachings are preached in the vernacular. However, the under- lying philosophy cannot be understood to the point where it becomes the source of personal enjoyment and self-satisfac- tion if only because this has no point of reference in the people's private culture. What the people considered sacred is de- nounced as profane. Their intellectualiza- tion of local rites and practices is branded as superstition and therefore it has to be discarded. Even in time of illness they are not supposed to call upon the her- bolario for aid because the latter's magic is the work of the devil. They are not supposed to drink tuba because drinking leads to other vices. However, they have to do something about their illnesses or those of their children. They have to plant their fields and the only way in which they can solicit their neighbor's coopera- tion is to buy tuba or gin for them. 13 Emile Durkheim, The Elementary Farms of the Religious Life , trans. Joseph Ward Swain (New York: Macmillan Co., 1926). Case Study No. 12 M and I were pulling weeds from his field one morning. After he had finished telling me some of the village gossip, he asked if I was being paid by the Government for what I was doing. I told him, "no," but that, I had received a grant from an agency to finance my study. He inferred from this answer that I had much money to spend. I said "a few pesos." Then he started talking about his son who was studying in Calinog and how this lad's studies had drained all of the family's resources. "In fact I cannot have those rice- fields plowed anymore," he said point- ing at the fields next to where we were. "Why?" "I do not have money." "You can borrow some, can't you?" "From the people here? No. - they are just as hard-up as I am. Can you lend me money?" "I do not have much, either." "Oh I do not need much. Just enough to buy tuba or gin maybe and a little for sumsuman (appetizer)." "But you are a Protestant. You are not supposed to drink. It was only last Sunday that we were told in Church not to drink or to encourage drinking. ' "I know - but how can I have my fields plowed? People expect a drink after their work." "Ask the Protestant members of the barrio to help you." "Oh they all drink. I do. It removes fatigue from your system, after a hard day's work." "What will the pastor say if he knows?" "Of course he will be mad. But it is his job to remind people not to drink; it is our job to finish our work in the fields." In a word, the new religious philo- sophy has set up for the people in Malit-</page><page sequence="18">APRIL, 1965 113 bog a rule which makes normative beha- vior inconsistent with local sentiments, beliefs, and values. A. Irving Hallowell has stated that the problem of "cultural change hinges . . on the condition and processes that bring about socially significant readjustment of individual behavior."14 Has the new reli- gion brought about socially significant re- adjustment of individual behavior? In terms of ideal behavior, that is in what people say a Protestant should do or what they themselves should not do - yes. But in terms of real or concrete behavior, in what they actually do, the religion has not yet provided them with a meaningful framework for readjusting individual be- havior patterns. The people continue to do what they have been doing; to practice what is locally being done; and to eva- luate things in terms of local norms and values. The preacher has again and again criticized this in the pulpit. However, most of the illustrations he uses are drawn from the Bible and, except for a few uni- versais, these references are beyond the grasp of the people. This does not mean that the people are ignorant or tradition- al; it simply means that they are oriented to a culture different from that of the personages in the Bible. In other words, the two cultures - Biblical and local - are far apart. Hence the people can but superficially relate the morals of Biblical parables to events obtaining in their daily- lives, if only because they live in terms of Malitbog culture and are oriented to its specific norms and values. On the other hand, when the village religious leader, who is also a folk healer, performs the rituals and cures the illnesses of the people, his activity and what he says become meaningful. Even if the preacher condemns the act of the baylan as "an act of superstition" and, therefore, of the devil, his stand is a position yet to be demonstrated while that of the lat- ter is an experience lived. Also, in terms of life-crises, the traditional system has the curative power of its rituals to offer, even if this cannot obviate the actual crises; the Biblical teachings, the belief in the new doctrine, aside from its pro- mises of redemption, cannot demonstrate itself in actual life situations. Intellectual- ly, it is satisfying; but to a group of sub- sistence farmers whose educational at- tainment does not go beyond the sixth grade, as I have already indicated, their grasp of the teachings of the Bible is su- perficial. In fact, many of them are con- fused about the meanings of Biblical phi- losophies. Traditional religion, on the other hand, is retained because its rituals and practices are symbolic activities and the elements used in them are selected because they are symbolically appropriate, even if they have not been found on careful experiment to possess causal effectiveness. These elements express for the people what Paul Tillich calls the "cognitive content of Faith."1* The following diagram illus- trates this contrast. 14 A. Irving Hallowell, "Sociopsychological Aspects of Acculturation," in Ralph Linton, ed., The Science of Man in the World Crisis (New York: Columbia University Press, 1945), pp. 178-79. 15 Paul Tillich, Dynamics of Faith (New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1958).</page><page sequence="19">114 PHILIPPINE SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW Figure 1. - Diagram showing contrast in religious orientation of the people in Malitbog. The structural position of the pastor relative to that of the barrio leader is another sensitive point in the process of conversion ( better still, religious prose- lytizing) from which can emanate resist- ance to the patterning of Christian expe- rience in the rural areas. By structural position I mean the status and its corres- ponding role which the pastor and the leader occupy relative to each other and to the community as a whole. This posi- tion, however, is dependent upon the loyalty of the people. For as long as he can effectively meet the needs of the peo- ple, the local leader can count on their loyalty and therefore maintain his status. The moment he fails to satisfy the peo- ple's expectations their loyalty shifts to another who can better perform the job. As a missionary, the pastor has the status of a religious leader. But because he is at the same time the only educated mem- ber of the group, the role he plays irres- pective of his status becomes encompass- ing. The people look upon him for as- sistance and oftentimes their problems are social and political rather than religious in nature. And he cannot simply refuse the people because their "following" de- termines his own status, needless to say, his job. And here's where the problem arises. For when the pastor in Malitbog, un- consciously and out of Christian love, volunteered to help the people with their problems, he automatically undermined this structural security of the barrio lead- er. Perhaps he was not aware of it but his actions posed a threat to the position of the local leader because the people went to him for assistance and not to the latter. The people's "following" began to shift in his direction and the local leader did not like it. Conflict emanating from this threat did not manifest itself</page><page sequence="20">APRIL, 1965 115 openly but it generated resistance to the integration of the new faith with the local social system. Added to this problem is the fact that the local leader is a member of the kin group and the pastor is not. In a kin- oriented society such as Malitbog's, the matrix, upon which the interaction of in- dividuals as they participate in group ac- tion is organized and regulated, is the degree of relationship they have with one another. This concept of consanguinity is central to the behavior pattern of the members of the barrio. A threat to any member is considered a threat to the entire kin group; in the same way that the shame of one is the shame of all! Thus when the barrio leader's influence over the people was threatened by the shift of the people's "attachment" to the pastor who, being the educated person in the barrio, met their problems effec- tively, the former's kin felt that it was also their social prestige which was at stake. Hence they rallied behind the bar- rio leader and formed a pressure group. Efforts to resist the pastor's program be- gan, not openly, but covertly - in their gradual withdrawal from active participa- tion in church activities. Not only is the pastor faced with the problem of social leadership but also that of religious leadership. Here his position is even tenuous because it is in conflict with that of the baylan who is also a religious leader. Both vie for followers. The status and income of both depend upon their respective ability to maintain a considerable number of followers. The pastor in this situation is again at a dis- advantage. The medium, like the local leader, is related to almost all people in Malitbog; the pastor is not. When a choice has to be made, the people often stick it out with the medium on whose as- sistance they can count at all times re- gardless of the kind of need. Hence they retain their traditional religious orienta- tion without rejecting openly the new reli- gion. This conflict-generating situation may be diagrammed as follows. Figure 2.- Social and religious structural conflicts faced by the pastor in Malitbog. Furthermore, if one views the problem in terms of traditional religious structure, one obtains a clearer idea why the people's acceptance of the Protestant faith has remained at the "folk-level." Why it has failed to develop among the people a</page><page sequence="21">116 PHILIPPINE SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW strong religious conviction which can withstand the stresses of local loyalties. It must be understood that traditional re- ligion is clearly interwoven with the local kinship system. Most of the spirits in- voked by the people during ceremonies - be it a ceremony connected with plant- ing, harvesting, or building a house - are spirits of their departed ancestors. In a society like that of Malitbog where relationships are primarily based on kin- ship, and where respect for the elders is the dominant theme, there exists a very closely-knit affinity between the members of the kindred - living or dead. When the preacher condemns the medium and calls the spirits of the ancestors "evil spirits" and the act of the people in wor- shipping these spirits "wrong" or "that of the devil" he impinges upon the most sensitive part of the people's social and cultural life. His criticism of these local beliefs and practices is a criticism against local social and cultural norms in that these spirits are not remote and alien beings but rather they are grandparents and great grandparents of the people; local rituals are not "demonic perform- ances of a superstitious people" but forms of respect, of paying homage to older kinsmen, of interacting with relatives. In a word, a criticism of traditional beliefs and practices associated with the cult of the ancestors is similar in context to call- ing our own parents evil and our acts of respect for them wrong. In fact, one is liable to be charged with libel in our society, if he desecrates the honor and memory of the dead. And if we revolt against such criticisms leveled at our de- parted kin, it is unrealistic to assume that the people in Malitbog would not likewise revolt. Case Study No. 13 H was an active member of the church. When his son became ill he called the local healer. The latter diag- nosed the illness as caused by the an- gered spirits of the ancestors because H did not celebrate the padapon cere- mony. (Padapon is a rite dedicated to the memory of the dead and during the ritual the spirits are invoked to come down and "stay for awhile with their living kin.") The medium warned H that unless he caused this ritual to be celebrated the child would die. So H went to Calinog to purchase the things he needed for the ceremony. On his way he met the pastor who asked him why he purchased so many things. Was he celebrating an occa- sion? H, in an effort to keep the ritual a secret, answered that he was merely storing food. By this time another man came along. Unwittingly, he asked H when he would "celebrate the padapon." Thereupon the pastor became some- what annoyed. He asked H why he lied. The latter answered that he did not find it necessary to inform the pastor since it was his relatives who wanted the padapon celebrated. Moreover, he told the pastor that his child "is sick and dying." "Let us see whether the baylan can heal your child. Have I not told you again and again that this binabaylan (art of performing the ritual) is the work of Satanas (Satan)?" "But I am worried about my child." "You could have brought him to the hospital." "I cannot afford it." "But you can afford the baylan. Do you think this kalokohan (foolish- ness) can cure your child?" "I leave that to the baylan. He is my uncle and he knows that better than I do," H answered. "Besides we have to fulfill our vows to our ancestors or they will become angry." "Those demons?"</page><page sequence="22">APRIL, 1965 117 H did not answer. He merely walked away. But he did not appear in church the following Sunday. In fact, he re- embraced Roman Catholicism later. H's case is only one of the many cases we have noted in Malitbog in which an untactful reprimand about perpetuating a kinship-based religious practice becomes a barrier against the patterning of Chris- tian experience in the barrio. It must be remembered, in this con- nection, that the people's social and cul- tural values often color what they per- ceive in experiences from the external world. Seldom would an individual eva- luate things or events in terms alien to his social and cultural orientations. This is not to argue for cultural determinism; this is merely to point out how culture influences human sentiments, thoughts, and actions. It is significant that this be realized because unawareness of it often results in major drawbacks in programs of change. This is what happened in Malitbog. The pastor assumed that be- cause he understood his Christianity, the people would have the same understand- ing of it. He therefore expected them to do away with their traditional religious practices when they started going to church. But they did not and this frus- trated him. He did not quite realize that to the farmers in Malitbog, traditional beliefs and practices do not contradict Christian doctrinal teachings. Both reli- gious systems are viewed by them as two different means of obtaining "assurance for security and protection." Both are re- cognized by them to be consistent with the culture from which they developed. As one of my informants said "Ang sa luwas iba man; ang sa Diyus tana lain man. Waay sanda naga sibu." (Free translation: Those things outside (of the Church) are to be handled differently from those of God's. That is why, I say, they do not contradict each other.) The people know Protestant Christianity is based on the Bible; Malitbog indige- nous religion on traditional lore. They likewise recognize that the Bible is a source of "power" for "those who know how to use it." But they believe that its "powers" are inferior to that of tradition in dealing with life-crises. Perhaps it is because the Bible is not, insofar as the people are concerned, an anthropometric personality like that of saints and envi- ronmental spirits. To argue therefore that it is through the teachings of the Bible that an indivi- dual resolves his problems and experiences "abundant life" is meaningless because there are sources other than the Bible from which they can draw assistance in time of need. There is their powerful traditional ritual and magic. Also to em- phasize the idea of "being reborn again" as a prerequisite to salvation and abun- dant living is an "illusion" in that the people do not have any cultural frame of reference within which to define the meaning of this philosophy. What is "being reborn again"? What is "abundant life"? The following case study contains what most people in Malitbog think about these questions. Case Study No. 14 B, an elderly man, and I went to attend the Sunday service. The theme of the preaching was abundant living. The pastor quoted John 10: 10 "The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly." The pastor went on to explain that the term they refers "to us sinners.*'</page><page sequence="23">118 PHILIPPINE SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW He said that "if we want to live abun- dantly we have to believe in Jesus Christ - to be reborn again in his grace. For as he had promised 'I am the door; by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture' (John 10:9)." After a while B nudged me with his elbow and whispered. "How can men be reborn again? Do they have to go back to their mother's stomach? Of course the pastor had explained this to us before but I cannot figure it out. As for abundant living, I tell you, I have been with the Church for the last ten years and I believe in Tesus Christ and in the teachings of his Church, but I tell you, I still do not make both ends meet for my family." From these case studies we can gather that the people in Malitbog interpret Biblical philosophies literally - in terms of mate- rial things which constitute their daily needs, which they see around them, and from the utilization of which they draw cultural experience. Moreover, the dictum that man alone can confess his sin to God, and in this process of communion he does not need any intermediary but himself apparently contradicts the rationale underlying Ma- litbog social structure. In this barrio one does not go directly to any other person 01 to anyone with higher status than him- self and speak to him about what he wants. He normally employs the assist- ance of an intermediary - a third per- son - to speak for him. This principle in Malitbog culture is best exemplified in activities connected with courtship and marriage. In a word the employment of an intermediary is part of Malitbog cultural pattern. Thus when the preacher tells the peo- ple to confess their sins directly to God they cannot grasp the full implication of this injunction. That they will do it pub- licly in deference to the pastor, there is no doubt. But participating in their day to day activities and in discussing this problem with them, the fieldworker soon begins to be pummelled with these ques- tions: Aren't you being disrespectful to speak directly to God of all the things you need? Why can't you ask the saints to do the speaking for you? Or perhaps the engkantu or the spirits of your an- cestors? They are there in Heaven with God anyway. Does God speak Kiniray-a? Can he understand our language or does he have a special language of his own, say Latin? If God is the source of Grace and power, therefore, He is a super- natural being. If he is a supernatural being can we reach him if we do not burn kamangyan (native incense) before pray- ing? I told them I did not know the answer, that I am not a theologian, and that they had better see the pastor about these problems. Perhaps these questions appear to be naive from our standpoint. Nevertheless, these express in context the people's world view; these tell us how the residents of Malitbog react to the teachings of the new religion. Seen from this standpoint, there- fore, it is understandable why, in spite of their exposure to Protestantism since 1931, the people of Malitbog have not absorbed the teachings of Protestant Christianity. Or in the words of the mi- nister: They do not forget their tradition. While listening to the preachings they say "yes" but when they step out of the Church, they do not follow what has been taught to them. They keep asking me what's wrong with confes- sion and even if I have told them a hundred times what is wrong with it - emphasizing that it is only through confessing one's sins directly to our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, that one can be saved - they cannot understand it. They will nod their heads while I am talking and say "yes" when I ask them if they understand what I am saying. But two days later, you will</page><page sequence="24">APRIL, 1965 119 be asked the same questions. Their tradition is in their blood - you can not teach them the right way. Subscript It is difficult to conclude a study such as this if only because one does not know what is going to happen in the future. I have attempted in this paper, however, to analyze the problem of conversion and the patterning of Christian experience in Malitbog. I have made an observation, in this connection, that many Roman Ca- tholics who joined the Protestant group later re-embraced Roman Catholicism be- cause the latter is apparently more in keeping with the structure and content of Malitbog culture than the former. This observation however does not, in any way, suggest that Roman Catholicism is better than Protestantism, or that the Protestant Church, in order to succeed, has to re- structure its religious philosophies and ad- ministrative policies to fit into the frame- work of local culture. It is up to the Churchmen to decide. It is for the people to make their choice. As for Malitbog traditional religion, I predict it will remain intact for some- time in that it is still effective in meet- ing the people's social and cultural needs. Moreover, the contact situation is not so rigidly structured as to present to the people an either /or choice. The tenets of Christian love which characterizes conver- sion allow for flexibility in the pattern- ing of religious experience. This permis- siveness in the normative system results in the re-interpretation of whatever reli- gious elements have been borrowed from the Christian religion to suit traditional ways of believing and thinking. When these elements cannot be re-structured they are retained as alternates and sup- plements and not as part of the social s&gt;stem - their major function being to support, rather than replace the pattern of local norms and values. In this set- ting, change is not deep-seated because it is neither valued nor totally rejected. In fact this acceptance of the Christian faith and rituals as alternates and supple- ments helps preserve traditional religion by cushioning the impact of whatever in- novative stress arises from culture contact and religious conversion; hence tradition- al religion is able to persist through time without losing much of its identity.</page></plain_text>
