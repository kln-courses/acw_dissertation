<plain_text><page sequence="1">OBSERVATIONS ON SOME EARLY ELECTRUM TYPES OF MYTILENE AND PHOCAEA (Plates 1-2) Friedrich Bodenstedt Among the rich holdings of eastern Greek electrum coins at the Amer- ican Numismatic Society is a hecte of Mytilene which, as far as I have been able to determine, has not yet been published.1 Its description follows: MYTILENE ca. 460/455 B.C. Obu.' Bull protome r., head turned toward viewer, revealing tip of left ear; r. foreleg bent, 1. thrust forward. Rev.: Lion head (incuse) with open jaw (tongue and teeth are not represented). At neck truncation is a rectangular incuse with a delicate dividing line across middle. Electrum hecte 2.525 g Specific gravity 11.99 (Plate 1, 1) This splendidly-preserved hecte is interesting in a number of respects. In subject matter it revives the coin types of the earliest hecte issue at Mytilene (ca. 520 B.C.; Plate 1, 2).2 Comparison plainly reveals the change in style that has occurred in the two generations divid- ing these issues. The unnatural positioning of the forelegs on the prototype - neither of them touching the ground - was not adopted by the later hecte; the latter example is oriented, rather, in accordance 1 AU iUustrations were photographed by the author except where noted.

The folds of the bull's neck also convey a more natural impression. On the earlier hecte the folds are carried all the way to the nape and back to the ridge of the back; these features, together with the stiffly-posed horn and the springing attitude of the forelegs, convey the sense of wildness. On the ANS specimen, the horns are rendered flat, almost like those of a water buffalo. The head is modelled in sharply-differentiated planes with readily distinguishable nostrils and forelocks and presented in three-quarter view, an element that makes its appearance in Greek art in the period of severe style. This quality places the work at not earlier than 460 B.C.; and we must acknowledge that our die engraver has done a very good job. The incuse type of the reverse provides a further peg for dating. This die engraving technique was supplanted ca. 455 B.C. by reverse dies having types in raised relief within an incuse square.4 Accordingly, the hecte in the ANS collections would have been struck between 460 and 455 B.C. While the plastic style of the obverse type is in very good harmony with this date, the mane of the reverse faithfully imitates that of the lion head illustrated by Plate 1, 3. The modelling of the head is inferior to be sure: the head is emphatically vaulted; the snout is drawn too short; the eyes are screwed up too tight; and tongue and teeth are lacking. One cannot say whether the hemispherical elevation inside the lower lip is to represent the tip of the tongue or the stump of a fang. All in all, it is the head of a passion-stricken tomcat that looks out from the pompous mane. The neat and subtly-fashioned incuse rectangle with its delicate central line (generally speaking the incuse is no longer in use by this date) confirms the impression of an archaizing and, as always, not quite successful repetition of a prior coin type. The Boston lion type (Brett, MFA 1687) of the period ca. 465 B.C. (Plate 1, 4)5 presents the actual conception of a lion's head in this Mytilene, electrum hecte.

Croesus of Lydia was perhaps the first to set together upon his coins the symbols of primordial strength and fertility in his use of the lion and the bull.6 Cyrus and Cambyses went on striking these gold and silver coins until the daric and the siglos supplanted them. Samos selected the bull and the lion for the first time in 522 B.C.7 - perhaps even under Polycrates shortly before his violent end - for its coinage struck on the "heavy Samian standard." Mytilene characteristically appropriated these coin types ca. 520 B.C. for its first hecte issue, probably for reasons of commercial policy.8 As the ANS specimen demonstrates, Mytilene again selected these motifs two generations later. This took place in a decade when the anthropomorphic divinity image was conquering the obverse at Mytilene (ca. 465-455 B.C.) as it had already done elsewhere with the heads of Heracles (Babelon, Traité , pt. 3, pl. 159, 21), Athena (Brett, MFA 1683), Apollo (Brett, MFA 1690/91), and the magnificent three-quarter facing Silenus (Bo- denstedt, pl. 9, El), among others. We find animal images twice more during the 440s: the boar pro tome as a beast of sacrifice (Brett, MFA 1648) and the goat (Brett, MFA 1682).9 The last animal figure on electrum from Mytilene, the protome of a winged lion, appears ca. 410-400 B.C. on the obverse of a sharply- struck example preserved at Paris (Plate 1, 5).10 Here we are again dealing with an unequivocally archaizing repetition of an issue in the British Museum ( BMCLesbos , pl. 31, 26; our Plate 1, 6).u The ex- pression on the lion's face on the former is downright amusing, like a caricature, as a comparison of the illustrations will show. With this coin we are in the last decade of the fifth century, a time when the ex- pressive forms of the archaic period were frequently being recalled and 6 BMCLudia , pl. 1, 14-20. 7 J. P.

The goat and the owl were the creatures sacred to Hermes and Athena, and it is surely not by chance that in ca. 365 B.C. we also find an anthropomorphic representation of these two divinities brought together on a Mytilene hecte issue (Brett, MFA 1733/34). 10 BN, Inv. no. 265 (not illustrated in Babelon, Traité , vol. 2, pt. 2, no. 265). n Mytilene, electrum hecte, ca. 505 (photography by S.

It is notable that in the almost continuous succession of Mytilene electrum hectes we can recognize deliberate retrogressions to the motifs and expressive forms of past generations, in 460-455 and again in the early 440s and in the final decade. Another well-preserved hecte of Mytilene now in the ANS merits attention since it provides a conclusive identification of the female head on the reverse: MYTILENE ca. 405 B.C. Obu.: Head of Ares, bearded. Rev.: Head of an Amazon, helmeted, wearing Thracian leather helmet with knob attached by rivets, cheek guard, and brow reinforcement, with hair flowing behind.12 Electrum hecte 2.59 g (Plate 2, 7) Former descriptions of the reverse are conflicting: Brett, MF A 1711: "Female head (Aphrodite?) r. in sakkos with button on crown of head, below which a plain and a dotted band; small projecting ornaments above forehead; loose locks of hair on neck . . ." Babelon, Traité , vol. 2, pt. 2, no. 2196, pl. 160, 36-37: "Tête casquée d'Athéna, à droite, les progna- thides relevées, le sommet terminé par un bou- ton . . ."

A second blow with a separate plain punch die, which was at that time common in Mytilene, is to blame for this lack of clarity. In the 12 See Bodenstedt, p. 42, M24*</page><page sequence="5">Some Early Electrum Types 5 process of striking, the ovate blank was placed on the sunken anvil die. At Mytilene the first blow was done with a square, engraved punch die, smaller than the blank. Thus the metal of the blank was pressed into the intaglio type of the anvil die. At the same time the blank received the incuse square with the raised reverse image. The second blow was done with a separate, plain circular punch die, having a diameter larger than the blank. The purpose was to flatten the border zone of the blank, not affected by the smaller square punch die. As a consequence, the raised image in the reverse incuse was more or less flattened out, whereby many details were lost.13 The reverse of this coin, together with a drawing prepared by the author (Fig. 1) show the decisive details: 1. The knob of the helmet, which was flattened with rivets 2. The cheek protection, flapped upward 3. The brow reinforcement 4. The neck protection Fig. 1 Thus, without any question, a helmet is represented here, as Babelon had already noted (above). The riveted neck protection which is recog- nizable on the ANS specimen now demonstrates that it is not a bronze Attic helmet which is involved here, but rather a Thracian one of leather, closely molded to the head with bronze attachments. Such a helmet, with the leather relatively well-preserved, was found in the Thracian princely grave of Golemata Mogila near Duvanlij and has been described and illustrated by Bogdan B. Filow.14 The bronze neck protection from Duvanlij is ornamented with volutes. On the ANS hecte, too, we note a raised ornamentation on the neck protection, the details of which, however, are not recognizable. The cheek flaps from Duvanlij have a cut-out for the ear which we similarly find in the cheek flap on the ANS coin. 18 Bodenstedt, pp. 19 and 50. 14 B. B. Filow, Die Grabhugelnekropole bei Duvanlij in Sudbulgarien (Sofia, 1934), figs. 137, 138.</page><page sequence="6">6 Friedrich Bodenstedt We can then say with assurance that our coin type presents a female head in a Thracian leather helmet with bronze fittings. The enlarged detail (Plate 2, 7) enables us to see a large attribute behind the neck, perhaps engraved in the die only after it had been hardened, which reminds one of the upper quiver section on the Phocaea hecte in BMCIonia, pl. 5, 6 and 7. But even without this attribute, a female head wearing a Thracian leather helmet would doubtlessly point to an Amazon. Of this reverse die we have a number of variants in which not only the forward inclined head, but also the flowing strands of hair beneath the neck guard (Plate 2, 8)15 show that the artist has represented the Amazon in lively forward motion, as perhaps on horseback. This motif is quite appropriate for an Amazon, but unusual for an Athena and inconceivable for an Aphrodite. The helmeted, bearded head of Ares on the obverse is also appropriate as a type accompanying an Amazon head. Ares was recognized as the principal god of the Amazons, and we cannot be surprised by the use of the Amazon as a Mytilene coin type for, according to a myth reported by Diodorus 3.55.7 (significantly on the authority of one Dionysos Scytobrachion of Mytilene who wrote ca. 150 B.C. at Alexandria), the city was founded by an Amazon of that name. I have only recently become acquainted with another variant of this reverse (Plate 2, 9)16 where a female head with a Nike hairdo is depicted in place of an Amazon. Judging from the facial expression of Ares on the obverse these dies were cut by another artisan who had misunder- stood the helmet knob of the prototype as the knotted hair of the Nike coiffure, and the brow reinforcement of the helmet has become a lock projecting obliquely upward. I may add here a few observations with respect to the electrum of Phocaea as well as Mytilene made while examining further collections in the United States: A) A specimen from Mytilene in an American private collection (Plate 2, 10)17 is similar to Brett, MFA 1735, but the small torch behind the 16 Mytilene, electrum liecte, ca. 405, Paris. Babelon, Traité , pl. 160, 36. 16 Mytilene, electrum hecte, ca. 405, Munich, cat. no. 43. 17 Photography by L. Goeppner (from a plaster cast).</page><page sequence="7">Some Early Electrum Types 7 female head, recognizable now for the first time, characterizes the head as that of Persephone or Hecate who are closely associated with the Samothracian mysteries of the Cabeiri. I have subsequently found the torch on the Berlin specimen of this issue from the Imhoof-Blumer collection and on a specimen in a Zurich private collection. Since no trace of the torch is to be discerned on many well-centered and sharply- struck examples from the same dies, it was probably engraved into the already hardened die only as an afterthought, which would also explain the rather flat and somewhat imprecise cutting. B) Plate 2, 11 illustrates a Phocaea hecte of ca. 380 from the Garrett collection in Baltimore. The photograph discloses a detail that obviates the uncertainty hitherto existing in the description of the female head. The Boston (MFA) specimen is described: "Head of a maenad to left . . . snakes ( ?) or vine stems in her hair, which is held by a sphendone;"18 SNGvAulock 2130: "Kopf des jugendlichen Pan im Efeukranz, links; " BMCIonia , pl. 5, 18: "Female head left, wearing earring, hair in jewelled net." The rings which can be perceived on the hair gathered at the back of the head, and which have been variously described as coiling snakes, vine stems, and jewels, in reality render an encircling net whose draw ribbon is visible from ear to neck quite as it is in the Arethusa of Ki- mon's famous decadrachms of Syracuse. The MFA die (Plate 2, 12)19 is artistically the best by reason of the charm of the head, but it allows the rings of the hair net to be only suspected since the high contour - another heritage from Kimon - is well worn at this point. The well- preserved example in a Zurich private collection (Plate 2, 13) does permit one to see the four rings of the hair net distinctly, but not the ribbon that encompasses them. Only the Baltimore die has brought us proof that an encircling net is intended and that we have before us in this Phocaea issue a late yet unmistakable imitation of Kimon's Arethu- sa. In summary, at Phocaea and Mytilene one can observe that certain details in the prototype die are frequently misunderstood and altered in the later substitute dies which are reçut by other hands. 18 MFASuppl. 176, pl. 17. 19 Photography by S.
