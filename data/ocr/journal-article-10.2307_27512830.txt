BERGER For as long as I can remember, I have been awestruck by the marvels of nature and wondered how we humans came to be. Are we really that different from other animals? Human evolution and sociobiology fascinate me. Recently, I watched a Jane Goodall film showing an alpha chimpanzee slamming tin cans and garbage lids about, running down a path while screeching threateningly at the top of his lungs and thoroughly intimidating the troop. What a show he put on! This dramatic display of dominating high rank impressed me as arrogant. My anthropomorphic assessment led me to think about how much of our own human behavior is hard-wired into our brains, as a consequence of millions of years of evolution. Bio-behavioral patterns, which have favored survival, are seen in our sexual behavior, nesting, territoriality, and hierarchy; that is, the quest for dominance and high status. High status meant getting the best cuts of meat and the most desirable mates. The pecking order is not confined to the henhouse! The bio behavioral imperative to dominance or high status, as it applies to physicians, has interesting implications. In western society, doctors tend to be at the high end of the dominance or status continuum. Such high status equates to a position of influence or power in the community. This position of power is also held by people in numerous other occupations: clergymen, policemen, politicians, judges, and military officers, to name a few. Power invites or makes possible or perhaps even courts?but does not make inevitable?arrogance. Arrogance is an attitude of gloating self-satisfaction which may characterize success in the bio-behav iorally determined drive to high hierarchal rank. And absolute power corrupts absolutely. Internal and external restraints serve to deter high status holders from succumbing to the seduction of arrogance. Internal restraints include a sense of responsibility and humility, sometimes (but not always) associated with religiosity. External restraints are those which are societally imposed. In the case of physicians, these external measures include: adverse publicity re Allan S.

I believe that, as a consequence of these societal changes, physician arrogance is likely becoming less common than in an earlier era. There is more to be learned from our non-human relatives. Power (trans lation: high status) has its privileges, especially when it comes to eating and mating. We humans proclaim this status eloquently, be it with medals and ribbons, elegant attire, luxury cars, feathers and crowns, jewelry, or trophy wives. Those who attain ultimate high status may become a Genghis Kahn or a Hitler ... or a Jesus or a Mahatma Gandhi. But rank also has its duties. As we observe in our animal cousins, with power comes leadership and responsibility for the organization, safety, and welfare of the pack. And so, the physician's high status and power, with its bio behavioral hard-wired roots, can be heard as a call to responsibility, to be "our brother's keeper."</page></plain_text>
