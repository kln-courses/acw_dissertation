<plain_text><page sequence="1">318 / EDUCATIONAL THEATRE JOURNAL pressive and almost always interesting, especially the Creation of the World that began the play and a sequence in which a god-like computer, winking with sinister lights, inspires orgiastic devotion in a female worshipper. Yet they had only the slightest connection with the spoken scenes (mostly unaided regrettably by film). These consisted of weary platitudes on life, man, woman, and marriage uttered in incredibly pedestrian dialogue by an actor and actress (he Adam-breadwinner, she Eve-housewife) who looked quite bored by the whole dismal affair. Possibly Languirand was not helped by the English translation of a French-Canadian origi- nal, but the poverty of his material could not have been concealed if Man, Inc. had been performed in lively Neapolitan argot. The St. Lawrence Centre was badly needed in Toronto. Now that an excellent theatre build- ing is inhabited by a permanent repertory company, we can only hope for better plays in the future. MICHAEL R. BOOTH, University of Guelph. ODYSSEY. Adapted by the Organic Theatre. Chicago. Summer, 1970. IHrJ OR(.ANIC THEATRE IS ONE OF THE NEWER GROUPS in Chicago's suddenly enlivened local theatre scene. As its name implies, it does "poor theatre." The Odyssey is performed on a bare central stage by four men and three women in tights and tank tops. With their bodies and voices they create all the settings and sound effects. The only other theatrical means em- ployed is lighting which helps to establish the rapid changes in time, place, and mood. The Odyssey is obviously a fine choice for "poor theatre"; only MGM might do it other- wise, there are so many fantastic places, crea- tures, and sea changes. The group is resourceful and the means are ample. One is made aware of how many opportunities the bare stage floor itself affords which have been so long unex- plored because the raised stage is for upright activity. Adapting and elaborating the episode in which a drunken sailor falls from Circe's roof, director Stuart Gordon sets his Cyclop's cave at a great height. On the way to it, his sailors climb a very high rocky cliff topped by a crow's nest. (All this detail and the pro- duction is rich in imagined detail- is supplied through mime and vocal effects.) Awaiting his turn to climb, the last sailor drinks wine. Once high on the ropes, he loses his toe-hold, hangs swinging for a moment as his friends desperately try to reach him, and then plummets to his death. The effect is chilling. The climb and seemingly free fall are established with the actor on the floor, his body parallel to it. The means of dramatization are boldly in- genuous. The giant Cyclops is shown as one man upon another's shoulders. His cave is estab- lished by darkness and by its entrance, which consists of two girls who face one another hold- ing hands above their heads, and by a fierce- faced man-door. The assemblage makes the sound of water dripping. For the Cyclops to enter his cave he must stoop and the girls rise on tip-toe. When Odysseus departs from the land of the Cyclops in his ship of six sailors, rowing and extending their legs for oars, the angry Cyclops grows smaller in the distance slowly lowering himself to the floor. There is nothing cute or self-conscious in any of this. The acting is intense and without artifice. The anthropomorphism is right for the Odyssey. The Cyclop's cave rises on tip-toe for him because even it must serve him, or else. Odysseus' sailors are as one with their oars. "Poor theatre" may be understood, as Grotow- ski explains, as a response to the unbeatable competition film and television provide for the means of conventional theatre. Our "poor theatre" may be further understood as an ex- pression of our youth culture, not so much in content, as in technique and form. It is inter- ested in sensation not significance, and in that which is physical and communal. The emphasis is on being, rather than on be- coming; on the moment rather than on causal, linear development. In place of the representa- tion of development we are coming to appreciate the representation of discontinuity and trans- formation. The choice of the Odyssey is in keep- ing with the general shift in emphasis. The journey home holds the episodes together but it is the episodes in themselves that are of pri- mary importance. Odysseus is the only character who appears throughout and his character does not develop. The episodic nature of the story, coupled with the small cast, necessitates numer- ous rapid changes in roles played by the other actors. And the story itself is about magical transformations: Circe turns the sailors into pigs; Odysseus returns home disguised as an old beggar and then reveals himself.</page><page sequence="2">319 / THEATRE IN REVIEW . . . There is an increased interest in the physical, not in appearance, but in activity. Sexual differences are not heightened by clothing or hair style, but neither is the body hidden. Those roles that are significantly female Circe, Ca- lypso, Penelope are played by females; the roles of sailor, storm, and pig are not distinguished by sex. In the obligatory orgy, which in this play expresses by means of many bodies the intensity and variety of Circe's bed, the contacts are pri- marily male to female, but also male to male and female to female. It is clear that this dra- matization of Circe's charms is effective because when finally she cries "One more time!t' the audience breaks in laughter at the clear im- possibility of that. But the interest in physical rather than verbal expression is more general. "Poor theatre" turns naturally to narrative sources because they suggest that things be conveyed by means other than dialogue. The productions are very closely allied to dance. In the Odyssey it seems that dialogue is never used where it can be avoided. The wastrels seeking to marry Penelope in Odysseus' absence make only the sound "biz." Nothing they might have said otherwise could have made them seem more inane or offensive than their repetition of that sound. In "poor theatre" as in our youth culture in general there is an emphasis on communality. The work is to be a group effort. That is one of the reasons for the theatre's being"poor"; it is to be a self-contained, do-it-ourselves project, independent of outside technicians and appara- tus. The Odyssey, a story of sailors in crisis, makes a fine group effort. Group effort entails improvisation. Some of the nicest moments in the Odyssey are, as I guess, improvisations in response to the director's questions: What would it be like to eat a lotus when you do not know what effect it will have? How do Odysseus and his wife greet one another after all their years apart? Communality implies that the boundaries between self and other are not as clear as one is accustomed to think. Odysseus' inner voice is spoken by the cave: "Blind him. Blind him!" Xt is as if the whole cave reverberates with the terrifying idea, but it is also as if the cave, in resentment for years of servitude, itself suggests the idea and rejoices in it. Communality entails the recognition of a man, not as he belongs only to a single group or period, but as he belongs to the whole earth. This recognition of a whole earth, combined with a dissatisfaction with our own particular culture, results in an eclecticism in choice of subject matter and technique to- gether with a lessening of interest in historicity. The choice of the Odyssey reflects that wider view and so does the way in which it is drama- tized. There are a number of ways in which the Organic Theatre's production of Odysseus does not express the youth culture and these ways distinguish it variously from some other "poor theatre" groups I have seen. It is not sancti- monious, egocentric, and hostile, nor is it lack- ing in conceptual rigor and carelessly performed. The adaptation is loving and vivid. And I wish the Organic Theatre well on its voyage. NATALIE SCHMITT University of Illinois, Chicago Circle THE LORETTO-HILTON REPERTORY THEA TRE. St. Louis, Missouri. 1969-70 Season. ST. LOUIS IS A TOUGH THEATRE TOWN. LAST SEASON the only road show house ran a mere six shows for a total of fourteen weeks and grossed a disastrous $300,000. The Sir John Falstaff stock company has closed, probably permanently. In- deed, the most dramatic moments in St. Louis centered around aldermaniacal legislative at- tempts to ban Hair. Yet a regional operation, the Loretto-Hilton Repertory Theatre, is elegantly housed on the suburban campus of Webster College. Their first three seasons had produced critical suc- cesses with Behan, Shaw, Moliere, Littlewood, Shakespeare, and Chekhov, but the house was seldom full, the Artistic Director left, a new Managing Director (Walter Perner) was hired, and modifications made for 1969-70. The announced bill was The Ides of March (an American premiere based on Wilder's novel), You Can't Take It With You, Once Upon A Mattress, Othello, Arms and the Man, and Bed- ford Forrest (a world premiere, by Joel Oli- ansky). Productions were to run two to four weeks rather than being in full repertory, guest artists were imported for single shows, and, finally, Bedford Forrest had to be postponed until next season because of financial troubles. The Loretto-Hilton tried to offer something for everyone: repertory modified to stock, visit- ing stars for publicity, a resident core, pre- mieres, classics, musicals, relevance, nostalgia,</page></plain_text>
