<plain_text><page sequence="1">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW VOLUME XXXIV JULY, 1941 NUMBER 3 CAELI ENARRANT * ARTHUR STANLEY PEASE HARVARD UNIVERSITY EVERY diligent reader of ancient literature has encountered, sooner or later, evidences of belief in teleology, the doctrine of the deliberate adaptation of the phenomena of organic life (and even of those of the inorganic celestial system) to some definite end or purpose, as opposed, on the one hand, to the effects of blind chance, and, on the other, to those of a merely automatic survival of the fittest and the elimination of the unfit. Further, from reflection upon phenomena susceptible of teleological ex- planation, thinkers, both classical and oriental, alike ancient and modern, have not unnaturally passed to a belief that the existence of orderly or purposeful creations necessarily demands the existence of an ordering and purposing Creator. The use of the word cosmos itself in a metaphorical sense, meaning an all-inclusive universe, is credited by Aietius 1 to Pythagoras, though Diogenes Laertius 2 says that Pythagoras applied the term merely to the heaven. It has sometimes, then, been held that the doctrine of teleology first appeared in Greek thought with Anaxagoras, of whom Plutarch 3 remarks that "he * A presidential address delivered at the seventy-second annual meeting of the American Philological Association at Baltimore, Maryland, on 26 December, 1940. 1 A~tius 2, 1, 1 (Doxogr.

And Aristotle in the Metaphysics 4 had already declared: "When one man said, then, that reason was present - as in animals, so throughout nature - as the cause of order and all arrangement, he seemed like a sober man in contrast with the random talk of his predecessors. We know that Anaxagoras certainly adopted these views, but Hermoti- mus of Clazomenae is credited with expressing them earlier." Aristotle further suggests that we should suspect such an idea in Hesiod or Parmenides, but he postpones to another time the determination of priority among these thinkers 6I- a promise unfortunately unfulfilled. The shadowy wonder-worker Her- motimus is too uncertain, as even Aristotle felt, to be estab- lished as the founder of this doctrine, yet from an early date, perhaps by the earlier Pythagoreans,6 an order in the universe appears to have been recognized. The credit of first formulating such a teleological concept, so far as our extant fragments go, belongs to a pupil of Anaxagoras, Diogenes of Apollonia,7 in Crete,8 in the last third of the Fifth Century, who, in a striking fragment 9 of his work On Nature (7rEpt @' afs), declares that "without an intelligence (vbrLms) it would not be possible that the substance of things should be so distributed as to keep all within due measure, with winter and summer, night and day, showers and wind and sunshine. Other phenomena also," he continues, "if one wishes to reflect upon them, he would find arranged in the most beautiful manner possible." 10 Here ap- 4 Met. 1, 3, 984 b 15 (tr. W. D. Ross); cf. H.

These pur- port to record conversations of Socrates, the first 11 with the dwarfish atheist, Aristodemus, in which Socrates asks, "Tell me, Aristodemus, do you admire any human beings for wisdom?" "I do," he answered. "Tell me their names." "In epic poetry Homer comes first, in my opinion; in dithyramb, Melanippides; in tragedy, Sophocles; in sculpture, Polyclitus; in painting, Zeuxis." "Which, think you, deserve the greater admiration, the creators of phantoms without sense and motion, or the cre- ators of living, intelligent, and active beings?" "Oh, of living beings, by far, provided only they are created by design and not mere chance." "Suppose that it is impossible to guess the pur- pose of one creature's existence, and obvious that another's serves a useful end, which, in your judgement, is the work of chance, and which of design?" "Presumably the creature that serves some useful end is the work of design." From this start Socrates continues to illustrate purpose, by briefly noting the adaptations to their appropriate ends 12 of man's organs of sight, hearing, smell, and taste; of his teeth, mouth, and digestive system; his philoprogenitiveness, his upright posture, his organs of speech, and his intelligent soul. The second conversation,13 between Socrates and Euthydemus, is yet more wide-ranging in its illustrations, explaining light and darkness, food and drink, heat and coolness, as all divinely ordered for the safety and convenience of man. "I begin to doubt," says Euthydemus, "whether after all the gods are occupied in any other work than the service of man. The one difficulty I feel is that the lower (97 b-c), had longed to find proclaimed by Anaxagoras, and deserves in all probability to be called the first teleologist among Greek philosophers"; Greene, op. cit., 124. 11 1, 4, 2-14 (tr. Marchant). 12 On this whole subject cf. S. O. Dickerman, De Argumentis quibusdam apud Xenophontem, Platonem, Aristotelem obviis e Structura Hominis et Animalium petitis. Diss., Halle, 1909. 13 Mem. 4, 3, 3-12. This passage and that just mentioned are summarized by Sext. Emp. Adv. Phys. 1, 92-94. Elsewhere in Xenophon (e.g., De Re equest. 5, 6; 5, 8) we find teleology applied to features in the structure of animals. Theiler (op. cit., 16) maintains that Xenophon draws from earlier sources, because he divides into two con- versations closely related materials, yet had he used as a source Plato's Philebus and merely expanded it from his own work he would not have separated the two parts.</page><page sequence="4">166 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW animals also enjoy these blessings." "Yes," replies Socrates, "and is it not evident that they too receive life and food for the sake of man?," after which he develops this thought in some detail. This conversation, like the first, passes off into mention of the help which the gods have given men by the art of divina- tion, and it would appear as though in some original form the two conversations were parts of a single discussion which itself passed into the mention of divination, for the same arrangement is to be noted in Plato's Timaeus, where a highly teleological account of the vital organs 14 is immediately followed by men- tion of the divine gift of divination, as again in the Supplices of Euripides,"5 and, at a later date, in Cicero's De Natura Deorum.16 The implications of these two passages in Xenophon-- clearly parts of one larger central doctrine - are various and important. First, the divine purpose, which Diogenes had ex- pressed in general terms, is here exhibited both in the small units of organic life and in the behavior of the largest members of the universe, the sun and the other heavenly bodies. In other words, we find a clear recognition of the analogy, so far as divine purpose goes, of the microcosm and the macrocosm, which as early as Anaximenes had been compared upon other grounds." Secondly, while teleology is noted in the lower ani- mals, they are not yet studied for their own sakes nor even for the light which anatomical research might cast upon the struc- ture of man - as Galen, for example, centuries later has many observations upon the comparative anatomy of man and the ape -, but only for the most sketchy kind of illustrative pur- pose, to show the usefulness of these animals to man. Lack of careful dissections and of microscopes and other aids is in part the explanation of this, but even more important is the consid- eration that the whole doctrine was still, comparatively speak- ing, in its infancy. Thirdly, it may be observed that the first conversation is held with a disbeliever, Aristodemus, and the 14 69 c-71 d. 15 201-213. 16 2, 162-163. 17 ARt. 1, 3, 4 (Doxogr.

The analogy is noted by Theiler, op. cit., 22.</page><page sequence="5">CAELI ENARRANT 167 second with the rather shallow and opinionated Euthydemus. Arguments for belief in the gods are not required in ages of uni- versal faith; it is only when popular belief has been assailed or weakened by sceptical intelligence directed toward religious doctrines, as in the Fifth Century the belief in arbitrary and capricious deities had been challenged by such men as Pro- tagoras and Anaxagoras,l7a that philosophical defences need be called into play, as is recognized by Plato in the Laws.is Thus, to Protagoras Norden 19 would ascribe the reproach against Providence that it made men naked and unarmed as contrasted with the brutes.20 Aristotle refutes this objection in his work De Partibus Animalium,21 on the ground that man's possession of the hand gives him more varied forms of defence than are granted to the brutes.22 That the views in the two passages under discussion are ascribed by Xenophon to Socrates himself need not imply that they at all accurately reproduce his words; indeed, certain modern writers 23 have attempted, unconvincingly, I think, to explain them as later interpolations from Stoic sources. But 17a Cf. M. P. Nilsson in Harv. Theol. Rev. 33 (1940), 7-8: "The criticism of the in- telligentsia of the end of the fifth century B.c. had uprooted the old gods by denouncing their arbitrariness and immorality. To this purpose the demand for morality, justice, and order was urged, and when the gods failed to fulfill the demand they were doomed. When philosophy with Plato and Aristotle took up the defence of the belief in gods it pointed to the purposeful structure of the universe which could not be understood un- less a Supreme Being had created it, and unless it were animated by a World soul." A somewhat similar rationalizing yet essentially religious purpose is claimed by C. Bailey (Proc. Class. Assoc. 19 [1922], 14) for Lucretius, and by J. H. Robinson (The Mind in the Making [1921], 194-125) for the philosophic and scientific reaction against notions of capricious and arbitrary divine intervention, beginning with the thirteenth century. The Stoic attempt to retain both 'interventionist' and 'isolationist' deities can be clearly seen in such a passage as Cic. N.D. 2, 14-15. - W. A. Heidel, Proc. Amer. Acad. of Arts and Sciences 45 (1910), 94-95, thinks that philosophers of the sixth and fifth centuries attributed to 4bats so many divine functions that Socratic teleology was a foregone conclusion. 18 10, p. 891 a-c; cf. also W.

Passing over such imaginative teleology as that in the seventh book of the Republic,24 in which our eyes are said to be made for the study of astronomy and our ears for the appreciation of harmony, and such general but preparatory statements as that in the Timaeus 25 - our first great cosmology in which design plays a chief r61le - that God considers order better than dis- order, we may observe the lengthy and more practical recital in the Timaeus 26 of the arrangement of the human body, with its erect posture,27 as distinguished from the prone forms of the brutes, intent only upon their food - a conceit appearing re- peatedly in later Greek and Latin writers -, and with a perfect appropriateness in its midriff, heart, lungs, liver, digestive tract, marrow, brain, bone, flesh, sinews, joints, mouth, skin, hair, nails, veins, respiratory system, and blood, all discussed in great detail.

Conger, Theories of Macrocosm and Microcosm in the Hist. of Philosophy (1922), in which pp. 1-27 deal with antiquity and 29-36 with patristic writers.

Henderson, The Fitness of the Environment (1924), 278-279: "There is but one immediate compensation for this complexity: a proof that somehow, beneath adaptations, peculiar and unsuspected relationships exist between the properties of matter and the phenomena of life; that the process of cosmic evolution is indissolubly linked with the fundamental characteristics of the organism; that logically, in some obscure manner, cosmic and biological evolution are one. In short, we appear to be led to the assumption that the genetic or evolutionary processes, both cosmic and bi- ological, when considered in certain aspects, constitute a single orderly development that yields results not merely contingent, but resembling those which in human action we recognize as purposeful." Cf. also p. 312.</page><page sequence="7">CAELI ENARRANT 169 verse is governed by a capricious chance or ordered by mind and wisdom.29 We observe and attempt to imitate the order of the heavens.3- God it is who brought order out of chaos; 31 a thing moved implies a mover; 32 hence the ordered courses of the heavens necessitate a superior soul regulating the cosmos; 33 and earth, sun, stars, the universe, and the succession of the seasons are evidences of the existence of deity.34 This brief an- thology of views expressed at length in several different works - the Republic, Laws, Timaeus, and Philebus - strikes one at once by its essential likeness to the conversations in Xenophon's Memorabilia,35 and both authors use the same term (8qtLovpybs) for the Creator."3 In a passage in the Laws 37 the Athenian stranger reports the mistaken view of some that the heavens, animals, plants, and changes of the seasons are due, not to reason or deity, but to nature and chance, thus significantly recognizing that theistic arguments were at the time far from unanimously accepted, and anticipating the later conflict at this same point between Stoics and Epicureans. A natural assumption, when we note the agreement between Xenophon and Plato, would be that they have a common origin in the teachings of Socrates. At this point, however, we are confronted by a parallel in Euripides, who in the Supplices 38 makes Theseus praise the deity who raised men from the brutes and gave them reason and the tongue for speech, food and drink 29 Phileb. 28 d; 30 c-d. 30 Rep. 6, 500 c. If Cicero (N.D. 2, 37) seems to ascribe this thought to Chrysippus it must appear in him only as a derivative from an earlier source. The order of the heavenly bodies is in Tim. 40 c compared to a crowd of human dancers - a conceit found in several later writers; cf. R. E. Witt in Class.

For a discussion of the relation of this passage to Xenophon cf. Theiler, op. cit., 38-44, who at points appears oversubtle in his attempt to discover multiple sources.</page><page sequence="8">170 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW from the earth, shelter and seaborne commerce; after which the poet passes on,39 as in the two conversations in Xenophon and the treatment in the Timaeus,40 to speak of divination, begin- ning with that by means of the liver. A relation between all these passages seems natural, and the addition in each case of the mention of divination --not so closely related to the thought as to be an obvious logical appendage - suggests a written source, or at any rate a unity of tradition more close than the mere vague background of contemporary common- places. Since Euripides was at various other points considered by the ancients to have been influenced by Socrates,41 Gomperz argues 42 that both Xenophon and Euripides here derive im- mediately from the teachings of Socrates (who might, of course, have been himself influenced in his thought by Diogenes of Apollonia). Yet against this purely oral derivation of three quite distinct writers from a philosopher who did not commit his views to writing - and whom Xenophon, for example, must have heard at least forty years before he was composing the Memorabilia 43 1 are to be set, on the one hand, the coincidence of these allusions to divination, and, more significantly, a rather impressive series of likenesses between Xenophon and the scanty remains of Diogenes, as well as what can be plausibly reconstructed of Diogenes from the study of sources made in some detail by Theiler in his substantial treatise on teleological views of nature up to the time of Aristotle.44 If the likenesses which he finds between Diogenes and Xenophon seem rather more striking than those between Diogenes and Plato 45 it may be because the more matter-of-fact Xenophon has repeated with greater accuracy the tenets of his source while Plato has passed the inherited ideas through the alembic of his own mind, from which they emerge as assimilated portions of his own thought.46 39 211-213. 40 71 a-72 b. 41 H.

By Aristotle, then, whose philosophy of nature is strikingly teleological,48 we are repeatedly told that nature produces nothing superfluous or without a purpose, but everything for the sake of something else, never omitting what is necessary,49 since she operates for the sake of an end,50 and everything exists for some final cause.5" In greater fulness than that of Plato's Timaeus, Aristotle, on the basis of his more abundantly collected scientific observations, at one time par- ticular, at another generalized, discusses man's physical adapta- tion to his various needs, dwelling in detail upon such points as his sense-organs,52 his lips and tongue,53 teeth,54 the human hand,55 the uses of hair,5" the purpose of sexual differences,57 47 Jahrb. f.

An. 5, 1, 778 a 30 Aristotle wavers; the eye exists for a final cause, but it is not blue for a final cause, unless this condition be characteristic of the kind of animal. L. J. Henderson, The Order of Nature (1925), 18, thinks this admission damaging to the logical consistency of Aristotle's teleology, and believes that there are altogether too many cases of dysteleology. But perhaps the weakness in Aristotle's statement is rather in assuming that a fallible human thinker is always able to detect the presence or absence of a final cause, and hence in this case to venture to deny a final cause to the blueness of a blue eye.

For example, he re- marks 59 that the walls of the belly in all animals are devoid of bones in order that there may be no hindrance to the expansion which necessarily occurs in this part after a meal, for even such animals as have no graces to charm the sense "by disclosing to intellectual perception the artistic spirit that designed them, give immense pleasure to all who can trace links of causation, and are inclined to philosophy." 60 These originals, he further notes,61 are far more interesting than any of those imitations of them by painters or sculptors in which we take such delight. Aristotle feels no hesitation, then, in detecting traces of the same design in the lower animals, whether it be in their anat- omy, their defensive mechanisms, or their ability to secure their food,62 though he seems always convinced that the brutes are created for the sake of man,63 just as plants - whose individual parts are likewise adapted to their growth and reproduction "- are made for the sake of animals.65 We men are in a sense an end, and other things are made for our sakes.66 Similarities are occasionally noted between the microcosm and the macro- cosm,67 for order runs through all things, "fishes, and fowls, and plants, and the world is not such that one thing has nothing to do with another, but all are interrelated," 68 - almost an an- ticipation of the Stoic doctrine of sympathy, of which more 68 De Part.

"That the heaven, if it had an origin, was evolved and is maintained by" a purposeful cause "there is even more reason to believe than that mortal animals so originated. For order and definiteness are much more plainly manifest in the celestial bodies than in our own frame, while change and chance are characteristic of the perishable things of earth." 69 In the Politics 70 Aristotle tells us that "to introduce order into the unlimited is the work of a divine power, of such a power as holds together the universe." "It is absurd to suppose," he says in the Physics,71 "that purpose is not present because we do not observe the agent deliberating, for art does not deliberate." Again, there must be a first principle, for final causes cannot go on in sequence ad infinitum.72 In an eloquent, almost evan- gelistic, passage translated by Cicero 73 from Aristotle's early and popular but now lost dialogue De Philosophia - upon which much of pagan and Christian theology seems to depend - we find strikingly set forth - not without influence from the cave in Plato's Republic,"7 as it may in turn have been in- fluenced by the cave of Empedocles - the effect which would be produced upon intelligent but hitherto uninformed minds by a sudden realization of the beauty and order of the starry heavens.

And a little farther on,76 his adversaries, strongly prophetic of the evolutionary doctrine of natural selection,77 later to be propounded by Darwin and Wallace and to become a powerful opponent of theistic arguments based upon order and design, are made to declare that wherever "all the parts came about just as they would have been if they had come to be for some end, such things survived, being organized spontane- ously in a fitting way; whereas those which grew otherwise perished and continue to perish." This argument Aristotle briefly dismisses by asserting that the results of chance or spon- taneity lack the regular and normal adaptation to an end neces- sary for the acceptance of such a theory. These phenomena, then, must be for an end, but since they are natural in char- acter natural things must be for some end, such as the per- manence of their respective types.78 The mention in the context of the name of Empedocles suggests that he was the author of this objection, and this suspicion is confirmed in the De Partibus Animalium,79 where Aristotle asserts that "the process of evo- lution is for the sake of the thing finally evolved, and not this for the sake of the process. Empedocles, then, was in error when he said that many of the characters presented by animals were merely the results of incidental occurrences during their de- velopment." And, again,"s "Yet there are some who, while they allow that every animal exists and was generated by nature, nevertheless hold that the heaven was constructed to be what it is by chance and spontaneity; the heaven, in which not the faintest sign of hap-hazard or of disorder is discernible!" Em- pedocles, however, was not the only opponent, for elsewhere Aristotle reproaches Democritus with neglect of the final cause and with reducing all operations of nature to necessity,81 "To say that necessity is the only cause is much as if we should 76 2, 8, 198 b 28. 77 Cf.

We may infer that could Aristotle have known of the Epicurean theory of chance as the cause of the universe he would have met it with similar expressions. In the enumeration just given I have not attempted to ar- range chronologically the different Aristotelian works cited, but it must not, of course, be overlooked that in his early works, particularly his De Philosophia, he was more closely under Platonic influences, while in his later and more independent writings his attitude toward the final cause changed, shall we say, from equating it with ,'vx7i to including it in the concept of o s,84 a power succeeding to the Platonic world-soul and tak- ing over some of the distinctly anthropomorphic vocabulary earlier used to describe the operations of the demiurge.85 When he occasionally employs such terms as "God and nature" 86 or simply "God," 87 Aristotle is perhaps merely making a conces- sion to literary convention or to popular thought,88 yet he still holds fast to the notion of adaptation to an end, even if it be only in the unconscious teleology of nature rather than in the working out of a divine plan.89 The next important group to be considered is that of the Stoics. To a school with so large a body of dogma and active over so long a period many views are ascribed which it is not always easy to assign to their individual authors.

How far Zeno developed this thought extant re- mains fail to show, but his follower Cleanthes made it one of the four chief arguments for belief in the divine existence,"9 the others being revelation through divination, the advantages men gain from the bounty of the gods, and all cases of supernatural phenomena - of which the second is, of course, closely con- nected with the argument from design. Among these four that from order and design seems the most cogent, because based upon an increasing body of observed phenomena rather than upon dogmatic presuppositions or passing emotional states. The regularity of the heavens shows that they are not the re- sult of chance, and the great dwelling-house of the universe reveals an order analogous to that which in a gymnasium or forum indicates a purposeful ruler.92 The fondness of Chrysip- pus for collecting all kinds of details 93 and his proclivity for syllogistic methods are both focussed upon this tenet of the Stoic faith. "If there be," he says, "something in the world which man's mind and human reason, strength, and power are incapable of producing, that which produces it must be superior to man; now the heavenly bodies and all these things that dis- play a never-ending regularity cannot be created by man; therefore that which creates them is superior to man; but what better name is there for this than 'God'?

Further, the earth itself is for the sake of those possessing reason, that is, for men and gods.98 Cicero 99 and later Por- phyry 100 report that Chrysippus also asserted that, with the exception of the universe, everything was made for the sake of something else, crops and fruits for animals, animals for man, and man, a little portion of a finished whole, to observe and imitate the universe.

In a fragment of the third book of Cicero's De Natura Deorum preserved by Lactantius 104 the question is asked why, if the gods made everything for the sake of man - as the Stoic speaker Balbus had just maintained in the second book of Cicero's work 105 - there should exist things objectionable and harmful to man, both on land and in the sea. The Stoic reply suggested uses, already known or yet to be discovered, even for mice, moths, and snakes, and from Plutarch 106 we learn that this defence was that made by Chrysippus. In addition to Zeno, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus, notice must be taken of that highly controversial figure, Posidonius. In Cicero's classic treatment of theories propounded by various philosophers on the nature of the gods Posidonius is mentioned by name only three times, once 107 with Diodotus, Philo, and Antiochus as a teacher of Cicero; again,1'8 as the maker of a planisphere similar to that invented by Archimedes; and, fi- nally,109 as the author of a work rEptpL Ew,, in the fifth book of which he declared that Epicurus was in reality an atheist and only in name a supporter of gods, in order to avoid the odium attaching to atheism. Despite these scanty allusions 110 various scholars, such as P. Schwenke,111 J. B. Mayor,112 P. Wendland,113 H. Diels,114 and C. Giambelli,"11 on the basis of comparisons of Cicero with views elsewhere ascribed to Posidonius, have con- sidered the Rhodian philosopher as practically the sole source of 104 De Ira 9-12.

To decide here this vexed controversy would be both presumptuous and impossible. Non nostrum inter vos tantas componere lites. If I might be allowed, however, to express my present impression - subject to later modification - it would be that for the teleological views here set forth Posidonius, in his works rEpit OEv, rpt KOOTUOv, and similar treatises, and in his commentary on Plato's Timaeus, was in very considerable measure responsible, not as an original thinker but as a great collector, like Chrysippus, who amassed from his varied scien- tific interests many illustrations of divine purpose in the cosmos. That he introduced any new principle into the discussion may be doubted; rather, his hands were helpful in rolling up the im- pressive snowball 1s of illustrative materials which we shall later encounter in Philo, Origen, and the extensive Christian cosmological literature,"' and which is already prominent in the next work to be discussed, Cicero's De Natura Deorum. In the second book of this interesting work Lucilius Balbus develops at length the Stoic theology, giving especial attention, in nearly thirty Teubner pages,120 to the teleological argument, derived, as he tells us,121 from our wonder at phenomena in the heavens and upon the earth - phenomena which he describes in general, both by the extract from Aristotle's De Philosophia already mentioned and by an appendix,122 possibly his own, in 116 E.g., R. Hirzel, Untersuch. z. Cicero's philos. Schriften, 1 (1877), 224 (Posi- donius, Apollodorus, and Panaetius); H. Usener, Epicurea (1887), lxvii (Posidonius and Clitomachus [i.e., Carneades]); K.

Many, however, are to be found in the first book of Sextus Empiricus, Adv. Physicos. 19 On the works of Posidonius in which his views may have been expressed, see, among others, W. W.

With these general statements Cicero combines detailed illustrations, from macrocosm and micro- cosm, in great fulness, these being naturally the parts in which, by elaborated comparisons, scholars have had their chief success in seeking the sources of this complicated book. For all these marvels there might be three possible causes,123 nature, chance, or divine purpose. But Balbus dismisses nature (perhaps that of the later thought of Aristotle), because the regular but com- plex order of the heavenly bodies seems to show reason rather than an unreasoning cause; and chance - the constant theme of the Epicureans - because no chance collisions of atoms seem to form even a temple, a house, or a city,124 or a single line of poetry,125 far simpler undertakings than the creation of a universe. The attack on Epicurean chance as an explanation recurs at various points in this 126 and other Ciceronian essays.'27 It might be asserted that these are merely the words of speakers in dialogues and do not represent Cicero's own sentiments any more than when he illustrates certain types of argument in the De Inventione 128 by the stock teleological comparisons of houses, armies, and ships, or by the time-worn syllogisms of Chrysippus. Yet at the end of the De Divinatione,129 in his own person, he clearly declares: "That there exists some superior and eternal nature and that, one to be looked up to and admired by the human race, the beauty of the universe and the order of celestial phenomena force us to admit," while passages in the orations De Haruspicum Responso and Pro Milone 130 and in the dialogue De Legibus 131 are hardly less explicit. 123 2, 43.

In the manner characteristic of the New Academy, each argu- ment appears with both support and refutation; the authority of great names is subordinated to logical cogency; and the tie vote at the end of the dialogue is designed, I am convinced, not in support of any definite tenets, whether Epicurean, Stoic, or even Academic, but, with the two Academics on opposite sides, to make clear that Cicero's purpose is to illustrate the proper methods rather than the precise results of argumentative in- quiry.132 It is not surprising, then, that the last book of this work is occupied with the refutation of the Stoic arguments for the existence and providential care of the gods, and that the teleological argument came in for its share of the refutation. That this book relied, in large measure, on the sceptical attacks made by Carneades against the Stoics 133 (as preserved in writ- ten form by his pupil Clitomachus) essentially all scholars agree.134 The third main section of the book, directed against the providential government of the universe, is, save for three or four unimportant sentences,135 entirely lost, in a presumably large and certainly regrettable lacuna, which some have sup- posed due to the religious scruples of the copyist of the archetype of all our manuscripts,136 and which includes also a fair propor- tion of the fourth main section, on the care of providence for mankind, particularly as seen in human physiology and in the subjection of all nature to man's advantage. That the work existed essentially complete as late as the early fourth century is shown by two or three short but important quotations - 132 Cf. A. S. Pease in Trans. Am. Philol.

God does not care for men, Cotta asserts, otherwise he would have given them, not reason (which often harms them), but right reason, and would have made all men good, or, failing that, would have rewarded the righteous and punished the evil, quoting the famous line of Ennius,140 nam si curent, bene bonis sit, male malis, quod nunc abest. The Stoic argument that God, like an earthly king, does not attend to details 141 is no fit reply, says Cotta, for the sufferings of the righteous affect, not their goods and chattels, but their very existence. The culmination of the parts preserved to us is a more searching fragment, not explicitly ascribed to Cicero, though rather plausibly assigned to him by Schwenke 142 and later scholars, and called by Lac- tantius 143 an argument of Epicurus, though it smacks more of the New Academy 144 and may be paralleled in Sextus Em- piricus.145 This declares: "God either wishes to do away with evil and cannot, or he can and does not wish to, or he neither 13' These fragments are printed in the editio minor of Plasberg and Ax (1933) on pp. 145-147.

If he wishes and cannot, he is weak, which is inconsistent with deity; if he can and will not, he is malign, which is equally foreign to a god; if he neither will nor can, he is both malign and weak and there- fore not a god; if he both will and can - the only combination which befits a god - whence then come evils and why does he not do away with them?" Further than this tetralemma, as Philippson has recently called it,146 scepticism could hardly go. These objections to design and its implications appear strik- ingly in Epicureanism, especially as set forth by Lucretius. Though at times his expressions suggest fossilized relics of the- istic teleology,147 his usual thought runs strongly in the counter direction. Men, he says, who saw celestial phenomena, the causes of which were hidden from them, resorted to deity as an explanation,"14 and gained thus a new set of terrors.149 But why should or how could the gods have made the world, either for the sake of mankind or for profit to themselves? 50 Nor in the microcosm are we to look for design; "Do not suppose," says Lucretius, "that the clear sight of the eyes was made in order that we might be able to see before us; or that the ends of the thighs and shins were jointed and placed upon the foundation of the feet, only to enable us to march forward with long strides. ... Such explanations and all other such that men give, put effect for cause and are based upon perverted reasoning, since nothing is born in us simply in order that we may use it, but that which is born creates the use." 151 Finally, too many faults are found in the world for us to suppose it divinely created - its waste spaces, wild beasts, diseases; its mortality and the gradual corruption and death of its constituent parts.152 These 146 Op. cit., 22.

Weather signs were appointed by deity for our use, as Virgil says.'4 Manilius, consistently with his type of determinism, cannot believe the universe to be created 1 5 or maintained 156 by chance. Seneca's sense of awe is aroused, not merely by the sacer inter nos spiritus, but also by the sight of the variety and beauties of nature,s57 and his sense of the divine kindness is stirred by the obvious advantages which man finds ready to his hand upon the earth.158 If we say that these come to us by nature rather than from God we are but changing our terminology, "for what else is nature than God and the divine reason inherent in the universe as a whole and in all its parts?" 159 And the first book of Seneca's Dialogues is an attempt to answer the question of his friend Lucilius why the righteous so often suffer. No real evil, he asserts, can come to a good man, for contraries do not admit of mixture.160 Though this may seem an answer less acceptable to the rank and file of imperfect humanity than to those moral aristocrats from whom Stoicism was largely recruited, yet it is obviously on a far higher and more impregnable level than Lucilius Balbus's defence in Cicero that the gods, like kings, deal only with large matters and not with details.

Maximus of Tyre, in the second century, remarks 164 that if we cannot see the Creator himself we may see his many and varied works, not blaming him for individual defects, but, as in the work of an earthly artist, praising the entire result.'16 Nature, he says, is blamed for having made man naked and defenceless at birth, yet she has given him an intel- lect to prepare himself defences far surpassing those of the brutes 166 - an argument already used by Dio Chrysostom 167 and ultimately deriving from Aristotle's answer to Protagoras already mentioned."16 The eclectic Apuleius in his Apologia 169 shows acquaintance with the cosmology of the Timaeus and its doctrine of the divine planning of the human physiology. In the work De Mundo 170 the cosmos and its order are noted, as is the long and widely established belief 171 in its divine origin, while its governance by deity is compared,172 in forms now very familiar, to that of a ship by its pilot, a chariot by its driver, a city by its law, and an army by its general. His first book On Plato follows largely the Timaeus, with much on the apt arrangement of the human physiology.173 On the opposing side and also in the second cen- tury is Sextus Empiricus, who in his first book Against the Physicists discusses the existence of the gods, recognizing that Epicurus had openly admitted it yet in esoteric expositions of the nature of things had in essence denied it,174 while the scep- tics, because of the balance of arguments, had suspended judg- ment.175 It is in general, then, the Stoics who support the gods, 161 1, 6, 7. 162 1, 14, 4. 163 De Soll.

Such undermining of empirical belief helped to set the stage for Neoplatonism,179 and Plotinus himself, though perhaps not greatly impressed by what we might call scientific phenomena, when he writes 180 against those Gnostics who maintain that the Creator is evil, recognizes 181 that one might be impressed by the sun and the beauty of the cosmos, but bids such an one turn his attention rather to its archetype and that pure intelligence and infinite wisdom which rules these things. A somewhat similar idea appears in the Life of Pythagoras by lamblichus.182 Por- phyry 1821 says that some consider man a tL4Kpbs 5bLKooCIoS, and Plotinus 182b had implied the same of animals in general. Sallus- tius, in his work On the Gods and the Universe,183 condescends to employ some of the stock arguments, such as those from the 176 1, 60. 177 1, 75-122. 178 E.g., a refutation given in N.D. 3, 23 on the authority only of the speaker Cotta is in Sextus (Adv.

Some writers in other fields are not without traces of the doc- trine under discussion. The Stoically inclined 184 Strabo 185 finds in the convenient geographic arrangements of Gaul an indi- cation that it was laid out by Providence rather than by chance. In another passage s6 he distinguishes the work of nature, which makes all things converge on a centre according to spe- cific gravity, from that of Providence, which begets living things, arranges the details of the earth, and assigns abodes to gods and men. It is not surprising that Vitruvius,l87 who con- stantly glorifies the profession of architecture, should describe the power of nature as the architect of the universe. Quin- tilian 188 asserts that geometrical calculations of the courses of the stars reveal to us that nothing is without order or by chance - "a consideration," he observes, "which may at times be of value to an orator." 189 The Elder Pliny 190 remarks on the appropriateness of the terms cosmos and mundus, and recog- nizes 191 that nothing is produced by nature without some hidden cause. And at a far later date (S.

Galen 19" most of all, and among his voluminous works especially in the De Usu Partium, abounds in apposite illustrations, of which I can here cite but a few. We should not admire the beauty and regularity of the heavenly bodies to such an extent as to be inattentive to the equal wisdom and providence displayed in the smaller objects of creation.1" From the construction of the creature one can understand the wisdom of the Creator, and the careful study of anatomy is of even more significance to the philosophical stu- dent of nature as a whole than it is to the medical practitioner.'95 And it is not merely at creation but also - as my colleague Werner Jaeger has called to my attention - at the curative power of nature in dealing with pathological states that we should feel wonder."'6 For, after all, Providence is concerned with maintaining as well as with fashioning its creatures, as is shown by a passage '97 to which Theiler 198 has well called atten- tion, in which Galen praises the provisions of the Creator that the eyelashes, to perform their proper functions, should keep always their appointed length and thickness.

In one important passage 200 the wish is expressed that from a bird's-eye view of heaven, earth, sea, rivers, air, fire, and stars we might be led to behold in all that moves Him who is unmoved, and Him who is hidden made manifest through His works. The Creator has made eyes, nose, ears, mouth, nerves, veins, bones, skin, fingers and joints, heart, lungs, and the rest, and just as a statue or a painting is not without an artist so the universe is not without a maker. In another passage 201 we are told that the cosmos, planets, earth, and living things were all created, and all form one system, which implies one maker, who can be no other than God. God, therefore, is one, and by Him all things were made. Again,202 if God does not make all things it must be because He disdains to do so or because He cannot, and this is impious to assert. Another passage 203 declares that the Creator makes things in order that through them He may himself be seen 204 by men; still another 205 likens God to a skilled charioteer of the cosmos. Finally,206 the evil in the world is due to matter not yet brought into order by the Creator; it is the survival of the primeval chaos upon which the master will in due time impose order. Aristotle's De Philosophia apparently made a strong impres- sion upon that interesting eclectic, Philo, who so remarkably attempted to reconcile Platonism, Stoicism, and other forms of Greek philosophy with his own Jewish background, for more than one passage in his works shows its clear influence.207 Thus, 199 Cf.

The meteorologist, says Philo, sees nothing greater than the universe, but the more discerning wise man beholds something yet more perfect, perceived by mind alone, and governing and piloting all things.211 Microcosm and macrocosm appear in Philo's succinct statement 212 that some think man a small world and the world a great man. An important landmark in our investigation is found in Philo's work De Opificio Mundi, which seems the first of those writings - later very common in Christian literature - which united the Mosaic tradition of the creation with the cosmological theories of the Greeks, and which form an impressive series from Philo to Paradise Lost. Philo's teleological view of nature is not without suggestions in Hebrew thought, notably in the Nineteenth Psalm, from which my title is drawn,212a or in that striking passage in which Job 213 says: "But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee; or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee; and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.

The clearly teleological intent, as well as the allusion in verse 5 to the strong man run- ning a race - an Hellenic touch pointed out to me by Professor W. H. P.

Or, again, a noteworthy passage in the Wisdom of Solomon,214 which concludes: "For by the great- ness and beauty of the creatures proportionably the maker of them is seen" - a logical expression of what in the Benedicite Opera Omnia or the hymn in the thirteenth book of the Her- metic Corpus 215 is uttered in a lyrical form. Such a thought as that quoted from the Wisdom of Solomon agrees with the remark of St. Paul in Romans 216 that "The in- visible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead," and with this utterance I pass to the next stage in our story, namely the whole-hearted adoption by Christian writers of the growing mass of teleological obser- vation and theory. The word cosmos is often used in the New Testament,217 especially in the Fourth Gospel, in various senses, but apparently without particular allusion to the argument from order and design. One of our most significant early Chris- tian passages is in I Clement,218 where the writer enumerates the Creator's works in the courses of the stars, day and night, earth and sea, seasons and winds and springs. Yet this is but a passing allusion; serious use begins with the apologists of the second and succeeding centuries. In Greek Theophilus of Antioch, in his work addressed to the unbeliever Autolycus,219 and Athenagoras in his apologetic called The Embassy,220 ad- dressed to M. Aurelius and Commodus, have brief but definite chapters upon the theistic evidence based upon design, but far 214 13, 1-5. I. Heinemann, Posidonios' metaphys.

Dio- nysius, bishop of Alexandria, refutes, with eloquence and in detail,227 the view of the Epicureans that the universe is the result of chance, first, by analogies from daily life - the cloak implying a weaver, the house, city, or ship a builder -, second, by the regular constitution of the universe, and thirdly, by the human physiology, which, he says, has so impressed certain medical men that they have been led to deify nature itself.228 Origen in the De Principiis finds 229 the artistic plan of a provi- dential ruler less evident in those matters belonging to the earth than in those affecting the heavenly bodies and not so clear in human occurrences as in the minds and bodies of the brutes. Against the philosopher Celsus, whom Origen describes as an Epicurean,230 and who had maintained that chance was an ade- quate explanation of earthly and celestial phenomena,231 Origen openly allies himself with the Stoics,232 asserting that the skill shown in the creation of animals must proceed from the highest intelligence.

"What greater injury can befall a man," he asks,234 "than that he should be unable amidst the order of the world to see Him who made it?" The works of Lactantius are permeated by the thought of divine design. Frankly aligning himself 235 with the Stoics in thinking the universe made for man, he asserts 236 that in this they agree with Holy Scripture. He largely relies upon Cicero 237 for his illustrations, especially for those from physiology,238 and for much of his argument, and finds his especial foes in the Epi- cureans. That the world was made by chance he repeatedly denies; 239 it is wrong to think it made by nature unless nature be the same as God, and if so why not call it God? 240 To the inquiry of Epicurus why, if God made man, he made him mortal,241 he gives a two-fold reply, first, that man is made of matter, which is fragile,242 and second, that his spirit - the essential part of him - acquires immortality by virtue 243 and by distinction between the evil and the good.244 If the sense- organs were not designed for a purpose but merely later used for such,245 then why are not men also able, by the chance proc- esses of the atoms, to hear with their nostrils, smell with their eyes, and see with their ears? 246 If man is born naked and un- armed it is in order that by developing his ingenium rather than automatically - like the brutes - he may clothe and defend himself.247 Upon the introduction of this argument into those curious Christian romances known as the Clementines,248 or its presence 234 8, 38; cf. 8, 52. 236 De Ira 13, 1. 236 Inst. 7, 7, 9. 237 Cf. the elaborate comparisons in F.

As Philo had combined Mosaic and Hellenic materials from a Jewish point of view, so these documents made the corresponding Christian combination. In the work of Theophilus to Autolycus already mentioned and in Hippolytus, who, according to Jerome,250 wrote a Hexaemeron later used by Ambrose, we see early representatives of this type,251 which seems now intended less as apologetic than as exegetic in char- acter - an indication that the chief enemies of Christianity were no longer the pagans but those actual or potential schis- matics and heretics within the fold who needed a more careful grounding in the tenets of their own faith. Central among these works is the Hexaemeron of Basil, which has gathered into itself much of the lore of the subject, and by which most subsequent writings in this field were influenced. This collection of sermons was delivered extemporaneously in the morning or evening 252 before an audience apparently enthusiastically interested in their scientific as well as in their theological content.253 Their philosophical source has by some been supposed to be the curi- ous collection known as the Physiologus,254 but many of the illustrations are drawn from Plato's Timaeus,255 while others are due to Aristotle, so that the view already expressed 256 that these and similar materials in later writers 257 were amassed, at least in considerable part,258 by Posidonius, is perhaps not un- 249 Pr.

I am in the company of the Creator and learn the theory of creation, and admire the Creator more than before, when I had only my sight as my teacher." In this same fourth century the Hexaemeron of Ambrose is heavily dependent upon that of Basil, yet it was itself of con- siderable influence in spreading the ideas of Basil in the West,265 where, however, many of the scientific illustrations adduced were already familiar from Cicero, Minucius, Tertullian, and Lactantius.266 Other later writers of this type, discussed by F. E. Robbins in his study of the Hexaemeral literature, I need not here mention.267 Jerome, busy with textual and dogmatic matters, has little which bears upon this theme, save the re- mark 268 that from the regularity of the stars some philosophers have suspected a providence in things celestial but an indiffer- 259 Nemesios von Emesa (1914), 68-137. 260 Poseidonios u. d. jiidisch-christliche Genesisexegese (1914), 293-304. 261 H. F. Cherniss, The Platonism of Gregory of Nyssa (1930), 58, makes this point very forcibly in criticism of Gronau, and remarks (p. 76) that no Stoic could have sur- passed Plato's Timaeus in defending a teleological attitude toward man and the universe. 262 Cf.

(This belief, rather frequently recurring, perhaps derives from the Pythagorean Philolaus.269) In three places,270 moreover, Jerome defends divine providence for hav- ing created vipers, crocodiles, and vermin, but otherwise his allusions are but slight. The date 271 and sources 272 of Neme- sius, bishop of Emesa's, work On The Nature of Man have been studied in detail, particularly by Werner Jaeger, and the book is found to show much of the traditional material, apparently deriving, directly or indirectly from Posidonius's commentary on the Timaeus. That commanding intellect, Augustine, introduces the tele- ological motive at perhaps as many as fifty places in his volu- minous works. God is a lover of order,273 as in Plato,274 though from our lack of vision of the whole we sometimes fail to see that order; 275 as we could not fairly judge a mosaic from looking only at single blocks in it,276 So with the universe. Where we do recognize measure, number, and order, we should ascribe it to God as artifex.277 Several passages 278 recall the vision of the emerging cave-dwellers in Aristotle, and one of these 279 be- comes lengthy and at points almost lyric.280 But the maker is superior to his product; 28s though heaven is fair its maker is more so, even though our eyes be too dull to behold him; 282 we 269 J.

The structure of the smallest insects, however, is as wonderful as that of the largest organisms,290 and the same God made the angel in heaven and the worm in the ground.291 Yet God's creation of man is more remarkable than that of the beasts,292 since he pos- sesses reason, which has invented the varied arts,293 and since he was made in that upright posture 294 which so many previous writers have praised. God has created all things for man's sake,295 but man's faults are not properly considered the re- sponsibility of God.296 Here we may perhaps see an attack upon the Manichaean heresy, which emphasized the evil side of the products of an evil creative power - a heresy to which Augus- tine in his youth had inclined but which he later assailed.

These are fused together into a whole in which the interest is naturally theistic rather than physical,298 yet the fact remains that, here as in other writers, to graft Greek astronomical and biological science upon a Hebrew creation-story demanded allegorical interpre- tations which could hardly prove universally convincing. In the hasty sketch just given I have attempted to describe the use of the teleological argument by some of the greatest figures of Greek and Roman philosophy, and its adoption by other thinkers of wide influence in Jewish and Christian thought. The recital naturally does not end with Augustine, but might be pursued through the Middle Ages 299 into modern times. From the late seventeenth to the early nineteenth century the doctrine particularly flourished, in such men as Ralph Cud- worth,299a John Ray,30O William Derham,301 Samuel Clarke,302 Bernard Nieuwentyt,303 William Paley,3o4 and the authors of the famous Bridgewater Treatises.305 In a parallel development, scientists, from Francis Bacon 306 and Rene Descartes - the latter a real founder of the mechanistic theory of the vital proc- esses 306a - to the mechanists of the present day, have thrust back the boundaries of the unknown, and tried to reduce all 297 Cf. the summary of the Hexaemeral writers by Robbins, op. cit., 23; 64-72. 298 Cf.

Room might still, however, be left for teleology, even for Descartes 307 and Leibniz,308 for purpose may originally have determined the direction of events, eve though each subsequent occurrence be mechanically ordered. Charles Darwin,309 for example, could not conceive of the uni- verse as the result of blind chance or of necessity, and, looking for a first cause, felt himself to be well-nigh a theist. Yet query- ing whether a mind like man's, evolved from that of primitive animals, could be trusted to draw such general conclusions he remained an agnostic.310 Among more recent scientists some who are most critical of conventional theistic views yet recog- nize the difficulty in originally creating and starting the celestial and the human machines.311 It is not the function of this platform to argue the question here considered, nor of an audience brought together under philological auspices to act as its judges. Yet I believe, as I think you do also, that no idea deeply studied and long debated by ancient thinkers lies outside our purview, if we approach it as the history of man's thought rather than as the subject of contemporary polemic. The fragmentary remains and the limited time at my disposal have prevented a more compre- hensive treatment of the cosmic order, whether exhibited in o30 Cf.

Woodbridge, Nature and Mind (1937), 29-36. 310 Henderson, op. cit., 208, thinks this essentially the position of David Hume. 311 E.g., Henderson, op. cit., 192, concludes that the remarkable properties of certain elements, especially hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen, must for the present be regarded as possessing a teleological character. And the late Hans Zinsser remarks (in the Atlantic Monthly, 154 [1934], 535, n. 1): "As Paley rightly asserts, mechanism presupposes God as the mechanician. This is the difficulty faced by all the recent astronomical and physical school of ponderers." Cf. also - among many similar utterances - Lord Kelvin, Nineteenth Century, 90 (1921), 173; H. F.

Yet, in scanning them in a series and reflecting upon them as a whole, one becomes more conscious of the march of thought of earnest and sincere searchers, from Diogenes of Apollonia to Charles Darwin. And, that our studies may not remain unfruitfully academic, in an age of confusion, like the present, it is perhaps not without value to have recalled for a little time that need for a harmony between the microcosm and the macrocosm so well expressed in the glowing lines of Boethius: 312 O felix hominum genus, Si vestros animos amor Quo caelum regitur regat. 312 Consol. !, 8, lines !8-30.</page></plain_text>
