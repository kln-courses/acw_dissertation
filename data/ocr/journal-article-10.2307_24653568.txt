<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EARLY IRON AGE SANCTUARY AND SETTLEMENT AT KARYSTOS-PLAKARI* Jan Paul Crielaard INTRODUCTION As the Plakari Archaeological Project started only in 2010, interpretations of the site, the study of the finds, and other research results are necessarily preliminary. On the other hand, the finds—especially those dating to the Early Iron Age—are abundant and already allow us to place the site in a broader geographical and chronological context, in line with the theme of this conference. LOCATION Plakari is located on the north-west coast of Karystos Bay, about 2 km west of modern-day Karystos (fig. 1). It is a low schist ridge, with a maximum elevation of 85 m.a.s.l. (pi. 26: 1). The site commands part of the fertile alluvial plain of Karystos, which is also known as the Kampos. To the south-west of Plakari lies a small, secluded valley with traces of terraces that may also have belonged to the site's catchment area. Rivers to the east and west of Plakari have deposited large amounts of alluvial material. It is possible that in antiquity Plakari was Figurel Map of the Karystia (Jaap Fokkema). I wish to thank the organizers for inviting me to the conference and for their hospitality. My involvement with the Australian Archaeological Institute at Athens goes back to the late 1980s when I participated as a graduate student during two campaigns in its excavations at Torone, with Prof. Alexander Cambitoglou as director and Dr Stavros Paspalas as ceramics specialist. It therefore was a great pleasure to speak at this conference inaugurating the AAIA's new excavations at Zagora.

Its hilltop provides excellent views in almost every direction (fig. 2). It can be easily approached by sea, but due to the shape of Kaiystos Bay, it would have been virtually impossible for incoming ships to near Plakari unnoticed. As regards Plakari's sea view, in good weather conditions not only are Kea and Gyaros visible, but sometimes even Kythnos and Syros can be discerned on the horizon. Andros becomes visible the moment a ship leaves Karystos Bay. Plakari and the Karystia are located at an important crossroads of maritime routes connecting the Euboean Gulf region and the Aegean archipelago.2 Not surprisingly, throughout much of its history the Karystia maintained intimate contacts with both the islands and central Euboea and Attica. On the other hand, the geology, landscape, climate, and vegetation link the Karystia with the islands rather than with the rest of Euboea. As a result of this, together with its geographical orientation, the Karystia is culturally affiliated with the islands rather than with central Euboea, from which the Karystia is cut off by the Mount Ochi massif.3 Figure 2. GIS-generated viewshed of the Karystia. The lighter areas on land and sea are visible from Plakari (Ruben Brugge). ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH Although Plakari has been known as an archaeological site since at least the 1950s,4 it was first described and investigated in detail by Donald Keller who started a series of ' For a detailed description of the geology and landscape of the region, see D.

This salvage work was a direct response to development and construction activities on and around the site. Already in the 1970s, roads had been bulldozed illegally in the area of the site and ditches were excavated for water pipes leading to a concrete water basin on the hilltop. In the 1990s, a building cooperation started with the actual development of the area for summer resorts which are located on the lower flanks on the south side of the Plakari hill. The salvage excavations have revealed architectural remains, pottery, and small finds from two main phases: the transition from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age, and the Geometric and Archaic periods.8 Two rock-cut niches on the highest point of the hill, indicating the presence of a cult site near the hilltop, belong to this second phase of occupation. The contents of a sacrificial refuse pit, visible in the north scarp of one of the bulldozed roads (fig. 3: A2, east of TW1), indicated that cult was practiced here already during the Protogeometric and Geometric periods, if not earlier. These and other finds underlined the importance and potential of the site, which probably can be identified as pre-Classical Karystos.9 At the same time, the continuous pressure on the site and the surrounding landscape added a sense of urgency to start systematic archaeological research. In 2010, the Plakari Archaeological Project started as a collaboration between VU University Amsterdam and the 11th Ephorate, with the author and, first, Amalia Karapaschalidou and, since 2012, Maria Kosma as joint field-directors.10 The overall aim of this multidisciplinary project is to understand the nature of the human occupation of the Plakari hilltop and its immediate surroundings and to investigate how the site functioned in various periods within its wider geographical setting. The aim of the first field season in 2010 was to make a digital map and 3D elevation of Plakari (fig. 3) and its extant archaeological remains (which include two terrace-wall systems visible at the surface: TW1 and TW2), της Σκύρου'.

We also started a programme of studying and illustrating the survey and chance finds that have been collected over the years at Plakari and are now stored in the Archaeological Museum of Karystos.11 In 2011 and 2012, we had our first two seasons of regular excavations. These were concentrated in two locations on the west side of the hilltop and the slope to its south (fig. 3: 2a, c and la, b, resp.).12 On the lowest terrace, Terrace 1, we laid out Trench 3 against the inner face of Terrace Wall 1. This yielded two rooms of a building that had been used for storage, judging from the find of a bronze scale-pan and almost 5,000 amphora fragments, datable to the second half of the 4th century bc. Trench 2c on Terrace 2, brought to light a rectangular building measuring approximately 4.6 by 5.5 m (fig. 4). A series of low tables or shelves made of limestone slabs were found against the inner walls; next to and on top of these was a host of plain and black-glazed pottery that had been used for preparing and consuming food and beverages. Some bear incised monograms, for example a combination of an alpha and a pi, another the name of the goddess Nike (pi. 26: 2). Lamps, terracotta figurines, and a considerable number of bronze personal ornaments and other metal items were also found, including an object that looks like a bronze collar. The building can be identified as a hestiatorion that was in use during the 5th and especially the 4th century bc. It seems to have been constructed in conjunction with Terrace Wall 2, suggesting that the sanctuary was restructured or even rebuilt in the Classical period. 11 These will be published in a first volume on the topography and previous research at the site. 12 This general area, delineated by roads A1 and A2, had previously been defined as a communal area and was effectively assigned to the community of Karystos, thanks to the intervention of Maria Kosma.</page><page sequence="5">The Early Iron Age Sanctuary and Settlement at Karystos-Plakari 195 Figure 4. Plan of trenches 1b, 2a, and 2c (Jaap Fokkema). To the south of this, we exposed the forecourt belonging to the hestiatorion. This contained several low dividing or retaining walls, two schist-made cists or bins, and a stone platform (fig. 4: 106 and 108). The most obvious parallels for the stone bins and platforms are found in Early Iron Age domestic and cultic contexts in the Cyclades, including Zagora.lj 13 A. Cambitoglou et al., Zagora 1.

It appears that preceding the laying out of the building and its forecourt, the area had been thoroughly cleaned, with the exception of a single Geometric sherd. The lower part of the head of a terracotta figurine of the Archaic period (fig. 7d) may be considered an 'antique'. Only in the south-western part of the forecourt we found an area where earlier levels were preserved, sealed by the surface of the forecourt. To this earlier phase belongs a rectangular stone structure (fig. 4: 128); next to it, several intact objects were retrieved, including an iron sword, a terracotta rattle, and two aryballoi that date this find unit to the 7th century BC. In Trench 1, which is at the southern limits of Terrace 1 (fig. 4), we excavated a large part of the sacrificial refuse area mentioned before (in total, an area of 77.38 sq.m was excavated down to bedrock). During our two campaigns, we retrieved not only a large number of animal bones but also some 28,500 pottery fragments—almost all datable to the Protogeometric and Geometric periods—and no fewer than 439 small finds (figs. 6-7). A few objects are of a later date, including several terracotta flasks in the shape of a bird or sirene (mid-6th century). The finds indicate that this sacrificial deposit contained both votive material and remains from sacrificial feasting. We found that in some places on the hillslope certain categories of finds were clustered together, for instance small concentrations of dress pins, or sherds originating from the same vessel (see fig. 5). This clustering was even clearer in the case of parts of large iron objects that had been buried together in two cavities located next to each other. On the other hand, in a number of cases joining sherds were retrieved from very different find spots, suggesting that part of the EIA pottery was broken before it was left on the hillslope. It seems, then, that some objects had been deliberately deposited in specific spots, whereas others— notably pottery fragments—were spread over the hillslope in a more random fashion. Part of the material had slid down the hill and been halted either by the uneven surface of the natural rock or by Terrace Wall 1. We may now attempt to reconstruct a first picture of Plakari in the Early Iron Age. It is important to point out that excavations and the various regional surveys show that the Karystia was inhabited from the Final Neolithic to the Early and Middle Bronze Ages, but Figure 5. Large skyphos, probably MG I, found in Trench 1b (Birgit Konnemann).</page><page sequence="7">The Early Iron Age Sanctuary and Settlement at Karystos-Plakari 197 Figure 6. Bronze objects from the sacrificial refuse area (b, c, and h courtesy of Donald Keller; a-g by Bert Brouwenstijn, h by Ingrid Keller). apparently not during the Mycenaean period,14 notwithstanding the fact that a locality named ka-ru-to (Karystos) is mentioned in the Linear-B documents from Thebes.15 This indicates that with the settlement at Plakari in the Early Iron Age the Karystia became reoccupied or indeed colonized. Among the oldest finds from the sacrificial refuse area is a bronze dress pin that may be as early as Sub-Mycenaean (fig. 6c), whereas the earliest pottery dates to the Early and Middle Protogeometric periods. This allows us to conclude that cultic activities at Plakari started in the 11th or 10th century bc, which means that Plakari is one of a very small group of Greek cult places of such an early date. The chronological range of the pottery from the sacrificial refuse area shows that cultic activities spanned the period from the llth/10th to the 7th century, with a peak in the deposition of ceramics during MG II or MG II/LG. Preliminary studies by Xenia Charalambidou and Filiz Songu also show that, along with a host of pottery that was probably locally made, there were imports from Attica, central Euboea, the Cyclades, and even the eastern Aegean, indicating that the sanctuary fulfilled a regional function. The eastern Aegean is further represented by an East Greek miniature fibula (fig. 6b). From further away comes a so-called bronze jug stopper (fig. 6h), found by Keller on the surface of road A2; most probably it had eroded out of the part of the sacrificial refuse area that had been exposed in the road's scarp. The item that takes the shape of a miniature jug with cut-away neck sitting atop a vertical shaft has the best parallels in examples from Trilophon-Mesimeri in western Chalcidice and Donja Dolina in northern Bosnia.16 These may be included in a category of objects known as 'Macedonian bronzes' whose area of origin may be sought in the northern Thermaic Gulf region. A biconical bronze bead of northern Aegean type found in the same sacrificial deposit at Plakari indicates that Karystos-Plakari was part of a network that connected the central Aegean with the Thermaic Gulf region. Andros was linked to this 14 ί. Tankosié-I. Mathioudaki, 'The Finds from the Prehistoric Site of Ayios Nikolaos Mylon, Southern Euboea, Greece', BSA 106, 2011,99-140. 15 T. G.

Terracotta figurines from the sacrificial refuse area (a-c, e) and the forecourt of the hestiatorion (d) (Bert Brouwenstijn). same network, judging from the find of a bronze juglet, excavated in the antechamber of the Archaic temple at Zagora, although it may have been a votive offered in the LG open-air sanctuary that precedes the temple. As Stavros Paspalas has shown in his detailed discussion of the piece, these and related 'Macedonian' bronzes have a wide distribution, reaching even southern Italy and Sicily, possibly through Euboean networks.17 Information about the functioning of the sanctuary can be provided by the votive offerings and other finds from the sacrificial refuse area. The 40-odd iron knives were probably used for making sacrifices. Most of the animal bones, often very fragmentarily preserved, were from sheep, while some were from cattle and pigs. The only other species present is dog. Of the animal bone fragments, 18% have been burned.18 Fresh shells and other marine animals (ark shells, cockles, murex shells, cuttlefish) seem to have been consumed too, albeit in moderate quantities.19 In the same area, all kinds of objects were deposited that can be regarded as votive offerings. They include personal ornaments of gold, bronze (fig. 6a-f), stone and iron, ceramic pyxides, terracotta animal figurines of horses, bulls, and dogs (fig. 7a, b, e), and fragments of sheet bronze that seem to form the legs and neck of a horse (fig. 6g); the fragments have been folded and have rivet holes and even actual rivets, which suggests that they were part of sphyrelaton statuettes. Among the anthropomorphic terracotta figurines there is a head, possibly made of local clay and presumably representing a helmeted male 17 A. Cambitoglou, Archaeological Museum of Andros.

It is likely, then, that the part of the hillslope south of the later Terrace 2 functioned as an open-air bothros,20 delineated in the south by Terrace Wall 1, which can be regarded as a (freestanding) temenos wall. The huge quantities of broken pottery suggest that during the Geometric period large-scale or frequent ceremonial drinking and eating took place within the boundaries of the sanctuary, accompanied by animal sacrifices and the consumption of meat. The dedication of diadems, finger rings, dress pins, fibulae, and other (especially female) personal ornaments may be connected to such life-cycle rituals as the later proteleia, that is, pre-wedding sacrifices that were part of rites of passage before marriage.21 Due to the thorough cleaning that preceded the construction of the hestiatorion and its forecourt, it remains unknown whether during the Early Iron Age one or more cult buildings existed or whether cult was performed in the open air, as at contemporary Zagora, Koukounaries on Paros, and Hyria on Naxos.22 Not much is known yet about the EIA settlement at Plakari or how it developed in relation to the cult site. It is theoretically possible that the latter started off as an isolated hilltop sanctuary. The surface surveys have revealed remains of walls to the west and north of the hill as well as fragments of storage jars, which may have been used for either domestic or funerary purposes but can be only roughly dated. The salvage excavations by the 11th Ephorate on the south flank of the hill brought to light the remains of peribolos walls, a stepped terrace, a house, and a post hole, as well as possible traces of a cremation pyre, suggesting that this part of the site fulfilled a variety of functions during the LG period.23 Closer to the summit, Kosma excavated parts of an ancient stepped road and a terrace wall that were in use in roughly the same period. Some metres to its west lies a polygonal wall of unusually large stone blocks. Although it was cut by the construction of road A3, its course can be followed for c. 12.50 m and it may be identified as a defence wall (fig. 3: DW). Polygonal masonry is notoriously difficult to date.24 However, we may infer from Herodotus (VI 99: 2) that the city was walled before the Persian attack in 490 BC.25 Perhaps this wall was constructed at some point in the later 8th or the 7th century, creating a walled acropolis that also housed the cult site on its summit. For what it is worth, most fortified settlements in the Aegean archipelago—the geographical and cultural milieu to which Plakari belongs— date to the 9th to 7th centuries.26 Like Plakari, most of these are sited on the coast, often on hilltops. Another possible indication of an early date is that Plakari's polygonal wall appears to be single shell. There are some chance finds that allow us to think that the settlement even goes back to a significantly older period. During a site visit in the autumn of 2009, we found a bronze globe (part of a dress pin), a gold finger ring, and a gold ear-ring on a recently bulldozed road (A3) to the west of the hilltop. In particular the mushroom-shaped ear-ring, which is decorated 20 Dispersed votive deposits seem to be a widespread phenomenon, attested for instance in Kythnos (set against the fortification wall) and Paros-K.oukounaries (area below Athena temple): Alexander Mazarakis Ainian, pers. com., also in the Archaic Aphrodite sanctuary at Miletus, where votive material and the remains of sacrificial meals had been dumped on the sides of the hill where the sanctuary was located, see R.

A large stone slab, found a short distance to the east of the same road and obviously pushed aside by the bulldozer, may indicate that there had been cist tombs present in the area. These finds could thus suggest that cult site and settlement were founded contemporaneously. CONCLUSIONS The Plakari sanctuary seems to belong to a very small group of Greek cult places that started off in an early phase of the Iron Age. In the course of time, it assumed a place in regional and even interregional networks, which may be linked to Plakari's strategic location at the junction of various sea routes. Votive material from the Plakari sanctuary constitutes an important source of information about Early Iron Age regional networks and the role of sacred places in overseas communications. During the MG II and LG periods, a peak in the deposition of ceramics is observable, possibly corresponding to an intensification of religious activities and perhaps also to an increase in visitors from outside the Karystia. It might not be a coincidence that in the Cyclades this same Middle and Late Geometric phase was a highly dynamic period in which a number of settlements on different islands were founded and/ or became fortified, and generally prospered, including the site of Zagora on the island of Andros. 271.
