<plain_text><page sequence="1">DISCOVERING THE OCCIDENTE West Mexico's sophisticated shaft tomb people are suddenly getting the attention they deserve. by Robert B. Pickering g S 1 z 'õ S I S s v Q fr ë 3 (S Until now, the Prehispanic culture of West Mexico has been known primarily for the large variety of well made and expressive figurines, such as these musicians, found in the region's shaft tombs.

Known for its characteristic shaft tombs, West Mexico's Prehispanic culture shared many traits with other Mesoamerican cultures, including worship of deities like Tlaloc, the rain god, and Ehecatl, the wind god. Yet it stands apart from the civilizations of central Mexico. There is great artistry in the design and manu- facture of a wide range of artifacts found in the Occi- dente, as West Mexico is often called, as well as strong evidence for trade in raw materials and finished prod- ucts with distant regions. There is architectural sophisti- cation in the design and construction of the massive set- tlements in the region. Stepped platform pyramids, sunken courts and raised house platforms, and ball- courts are well known throughout the rest of Mesoamer- ica, but in the Occidente, some of them have a curious twist; the pyramids and courts and platforms are circular rather than square in design. Recent research indicates that West Mexico was a heavily populated region with a sophisticated polity or cluster of polities, yet the culture was rarely mentioned by other Mesoamerican peoples or the Spanish. Perhaps the people of the Occidente maintained a distance from their neighbors by choice. Indeed, their large popula- tion and political organization would have made them a formidable foe, even for the Teotihuacanos, Tulans, and Aztecs of Mexico's Central Valley, who dealt with other cultures through alliance or conquest. Preoccupied with successive Central Valley civiliza- tions, past scholars, and even some today, dismissed West Mexico as a cultural backwater. Perhaps part of the reason is that compared to the Aztec and Tlaxcalan cul- tures encountered by the Spanish, its architecture was not as imposing, its population was not as densely packed, and its gold was scarce. Furthermore, there were no chroniclers such as Sahagún or Bernal Diaz de Castillo to write in detail about this culture. Instead, the conquistador Ñuño de Guzmán tried to kill off the en- tire population of the region. Maps in some recent ar- chaeological texts do not even identify sites or cultural regions within the Occidente. The curious part of this omission is that some of the architectural and artifactual features of the region have been known for decades. In the 1890s, Carl Lumholtz explored the Occidente 's eth- 42 Archaeology</page><page sequence="2">nology and archaeology, and as early as 1893 looters were selling in Mexico and the United States large quan- tities of ceramic figurines unearthed from its tombs. In the last ten years archaeologists, for the first time, have begun to find tombs before the looters do. Meticu- lous research and uncommon good luck have led inves- tigators to 32 unplundered burials in the states of Jalisco and Colima. This group is the best documented of the West Mexican shaft tombs. They were dug into soil or cut into soft rock to depths from about six feet to more than 60 feet. Most consist of a single room off the base of the shaft, but others have as many as four. Some are associated with habitation sites, while others are not. The range of grave goods varies widely, from a few utilitarian ceramic vessels to large quantities of highly decorated ones, along with figurines. The spectacular Huitzilapa tomb, northwest of Guadalajara in the Magdelena Basin, yielded more than 100 ceramics in- cluding eight large hollow anthropomorphic figurines, ten painted conch-shell trumpets, and more than 66,000 shell beads, as well as 12 jade artifacts and others of obsidian and quartz. Most people were entombed with at least a few ceramic vessels that presumably held food offerings. Bruce Benz of the Botanical Research In- stitute of Texas is examining residues found inside bowls from some of the recently excavated sites to determine what they once held. His work will provide the first real evidence of perishable tomb offerings. The picture provided by these tombs is not yet clear. For example, no detailed correlation between biological characteristics such as age and sex and the number and types of grave goods has been done, although the work is in progress. However, some details from individual sites are notable. Joe Mountjoy of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro has excavated three tombs in the Banderas Valley of western Jalisco. In this region, shaft tombs were only one of a number of op- tions, which also included burial in pits or in urns. Physical anthropologist Mary K. Sanford, also of UNC Greensboro, faced two problems in her analysis of the human remains from the tombs: poor preservation of the bones and the fact that most of them were burned and frag- mentary. Even with these difficulties, Sanford was able to determine basic bio- logical characteristics, sex and age, of the individuals. She also discovered that the bodies, most of which had been cre- mated, had been at different stages of decomposition before being burnt. Very likely, the bodies had been kept in an aboveground storage place before cre- mation. For reasons that still elude ar- chaeologists, the remains, skeletal or flesh-covered, were cremated and then placed in the tombs. It is impossible to know from three burials, however, if this type of mortu- ary practice was common. The most detailed analysis to date comes from the single tomb found at Huitzilapa. A team led by Jorge Ramos de la Vega and Lorenza Lopez Mestás of the In- stituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH) cleared the architecture and tested various structures to determine their construction and age. The discovery of a shaft tomb beneath a house platform on the site's southern edge was a surprise in that it proved, for the first time, that some tombs were dug under the floors of houses. Although the site is large, only this single tomb was discovered. About 30 feet deep, the shaft led to two rooms containing human remains and elaborate and abundant grave goods. The remains consisted of six ar- ticulated human skeletons, three in each room. An ini- tial impression was that the bodies had been placed in the tomb soon after death, but closer inspection showed that five were probably desiccated or mummy-like be- fore they were placed in the tomb. As is true at other sites, this points to treatment of the bodies aboveground before they were deposited in the tomb.

My osteological examination of the human remains from the Huitzilapa tomb has revealed that five of the six individuals buried here had similar developmental defects of the spine. It is likely that these people were genetically related. Only one person, an old female, did not have the spinal defect. Did she marry into the group from another lineage or clan? DNA testing may answer this question, if enough organic material can be extract- ed from bone samples. Trauma and pathology also af- flicted these people before they died. One of the older males had a healed fracture of the right elbow that would have been painful during the healing process and may have resulted in reduced mobility. Interestingly, two atlatl rings of jade were found at the right hand of this man. These rings were part of a handle and would have provided a sure grip for someone using the atlad. Was the elbow injury the result of repetitive stress and hyper- extension at the elbow caused by using an atlatl in hunt- ing or warfare? The evidence is tantalizing, but one case is not definitive. While the Huitzilapa site has yielded an abundance of information, it has raised more questions than an- swers. Does this tomb represent a family's crypt under their house platform? For such a large site, why was there only one tomb? Is it the tomb of the site's princi- pal family? Where and how were the rest of the inhabi- tants interred? The Bolaños sites, excavated by archaeologist Maria Teresa Cabrero of the Instituto de Investigaciones Antropológicas of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, tell a story very different from the Huitzilapa or the Banderas Valley tombs. Cabrero and her col- league Carlos Lopez Cruz have been exploring the re- mote regions of the Bolaños drainage in northern Jalis- co, where the terrain is rough and it can be incredibly hot. The archaeology of this area, which has been only sporadically visited by scientists of any kind, is not well known. The area is an important one because, although it is within the shaft tomb culture area of West Mexico, some of the remains are reminiscent of those found in northern Mexico. Cabrero and Cruz's work is revealing that nearly 2,000 years ago this region had a thriving population with contacts to the outside world. At a place called El Piñón, Cabrero and Cruz found a large site, where, during their excavations, they explored three shaft and chamber tombs dating from about A.D. 135 to 440. A small but finely molded ceramic ear spool that is clearly of Teotihuacan design confirms the radiocarbon dates and provides a link between El Piñón and Mexi- co's Central Valley. The tombs contained a large quantity of human skeletal material as well as many artifacts. Unlike the Huitzilapa tomb, where the bones were articulated, the material appears jumbled. Many bones were broken and disarticulated. Part of the damage can be attributed to the roof having collapsed, but it is clear that the bones were disarticulated at the time they were placed in the tomb. Very likely, these represent secondary burials - bodies initially curated or preserved elsewhere whose skeletal remains were later deposited in the tombs. The artifacts from the tombs share some similarities with those of tombs in West Mexico. There is a Chinesco-style figurine, a well-known type for West Mexico, and others that are similar in form but cruder in manufacture. Oth- er ceramic figurines are reminiscent of styles from the important site of Paquime or Casas Grandes in the state of Chihuahua to the north. These finds, along with the Teotihuacan-style ear spool, indicate that the inhabi- tants of this now desolate and isolated region had con- tacts with other cultures throughout Mexico. Some of the most extensive archaeological investiga- tions of shaft tombs have been conducted in the Atema- jac Valley, northwest of Guadalajara. In the late 1980s Mexican archaeologist Javier Galvári excavated 23 tombs. These consisted, for the most part, of shafts no more than six feet deep expanded on one side into sin- gle rooms in which interments were made. Galvan's work constitutes the largest sample of tombs to date. His work has revealed much about the structure and place- ment of tombs as well as detailed descriptions of grave goods. Unfortunately, the skeletons have yet to be de- scribed in an equally detailed manner. Though the shaft tombs have given their name to the people who built them, they are only one aspect of the culture and not its sole defining element, even though past archaeologists went so far as to claim that the an- cient West Mexicans were obsessed with a cult of the dead. While the construction of the tombs and the fash- 44 Archaeology</page><page sequence="4">ioning of the grave goods placed in them do represent great expenditures of time and energy, the effort was not unusual when seen in a wider Mesoamerican cultur- al context. During the last five years, research by Mexican, American, and French archaeologists has begun to re- veal other aspects of West Mexico's Prehispanic culture. Phil C. Weigand of the Museum of Northern Arizona and the Colegio de Michoacan, Joe Mountjoy, and a French-led team known as ORSTOM (L'Institut Français de Recherche Scientifique pour le Développ- ment en Coopération, France) have taken a regional survey approach, and are mapping all sites in specific geographical basins or drainages to determine site den- sity, size, and structure. Over nearly a quar- ter of a century, Wei- gand has found and mapped hundreds of sites around Etzatlan, Jalisco, and the Volcan de Tequila, northwest of Guadalajara. Much of his research has con- cerned the origins and evolution of civiliza- tions in the Occidente, but in recent years he has focused on the identification and dis- tribution of the re- gion's unique settle- ment architecture. In most of Mesoamerica, house and temple ar- chitecture is square or rectangular. Step-like talud-tablero architecture is per- haps the best known style, and can be seen at Teotihua- can, the Templo Mayor in Mexico City, and Maya sites such as Palenque and Chichen Itzá. In West Mexico, cir- cular arrangements of structures existed at least as early as the period between 1000 and 300 B.c. During the Classic period (ca. A.D. 200-700), the use of concentric circle forms reached its formal and most elaborate de- velopment at the site of Teuchitlan near Etzatlan. A central, circular stepped pyramidal structure was sur- rounded by a circular, raised plaza which itself was sur- rounded by a circular banquette or walkway on top of which smaller structures (presumably houses) were built. From the air, the circular pattern is striking. These constructions were made of mortared stones, of- ten coated with a wash of lime plaster. Evidence that the plastered walls and even the roofs were painted comes from the exquisite house and platform models found in the region's shaft tombs. Circular structures may even be linked to or adjacent to each other in a way rarely seen in the rest of ancient Mexico. Weigand has called this system of structures the Teuchitlan tradition. Within 50 miles of the Volcan de Tequila, he and his associates have located no fewer than 400 circular buildings. As survey work has extended out from this core region, similar sites have been found in the West Mexican states of Nayarit and Colima, as well as in southern Jalisco and Guanajuato. Teuchitlan sites can no longer be consid- ered an aberration or the misinterpretation of talud- tablero architecture by a provincial people living in the hinterland of Mexico's Central Valley. Mountjoy's surveys in valleys near Puerto Vallarta demonstrate that the region was heavily inhabited long before European contact. People had the advantage of exploiting sea resources - marine mammals, fish, and shellfish - as well as those from the land en- vironments stretching from the coast to the mountains. Mountjoy has found despoiled shaft tombs in his sur- veys, and has inter- viewed local people about the artifacts found in them. The evi- dence indicates that there are many broad similarities in mortuary practice between his re- search region and oth- er parts of Colima, Jalis- co, and Nayarit. In addition to an ex- tensive site survey, the ORSTOM team has worked intensively in the Sayula Basin west of Guadalajara, where there are salt-producing sites. Salt making is remembered in the legend and lore of the region. The work by ORSTOM is revealing how ancient West Mexicans made salt by evap- orating naturally briny water from a lake in large ceram- ic pans. Early inhabitants gathered salt for their own needs and, apparently, traded it outside the basin. Glen Stuart of Arizona State University is exploring the region's ancient canal and garden complexes. In the 1970s, Weigand suggested that faint outlines of rectan- gular fields separated by canals of varying widths were the remains of chinampas or floating gardens known from sites in central Mexico, such as Tenochtitlán, the Aztec capital. Exploratory aerial and ground surveys by Weigand and more intensive research by Stuart have clearly demonstrated that these traces on the landscape are of extensive wetland field systems, some of which cover more than 200 acres. We assume that, by analogy with other Mesoamerican cultures, corn, beans, and squash were grown, but this has not been proved. The large numbers of Teuchitlan-style buildings and the ex- o 3 c3 V H H u 3 a Markings on warrior figurines found at Bolaños, West Mexico, are similar to those known from northern Mexican sites, suggesting long-range cultural contacts.

Such a conclusion is not sur- prising. The region's mild climate and abundant water supply supported rich plant and animal communities. Other researchers have focused on analyses of specif- ic classes of artifacts. Archaeologists are now taking ad- vantage of a whole new range of analytical tools, from refined dating techniques to various kinds of mi- croscopy and radiography, to analyze material in new ways. Recent studies by Dorothy Hosier of the Massachu- setts Institute of Technology are a case in point. For years, copper tools from West Mexican tombs and other sites have been known. She has combined traditional morphological and distributional studies with trace ele- ment analysis and microscopic examinations of struc- ture to show manufacturing techniques and to try to identify the sources of the ores used in smelting. Her work shows that copper tools seem to occur earliest near the coast of West Mexico and then spread inland. Hosier suggests that the origins of West Mexican metal- lurgy are to be found along the western coast of north- ern South America. The relation between these two re- gions is a topic of great interest and debate. Although the "smoking gun" of archaeological evidence remains to be revealed, many lines of investigation point to long- term interaction between them (see page 48) . Today, archaeology in West Mexico is about where Maya archaeology was 30 to 50 years ago. Within the next few years, archaeologists will be able to answer some of the basic questions about West Mexican soci- eties. Already the data from site surveys and the excava- tion of habitation and mortuary sites are showing that the sociopolitical and religious development of the re- gion's people was complex and that their technological development was sophisticated. For those studying the ancient culture of West Mexico, there is much to be done. It is a time of great discovery. ■ Robert B.
