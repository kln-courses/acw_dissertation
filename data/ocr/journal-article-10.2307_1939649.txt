Integrated public lands management: principles and applications to national forests, parks, wildlife refuges, and BLM lands. Columbia University Press, New York. $50.00, ISBN: 0-231-08006-9 (acid-free paper). This book is intended as a textbook for upper-division and graduate students studying public land use planning and man- agement. Although the title implies a multi-disciplinary ap- proach, its disciplinary focus is, in fact, very narrowly eco- nomics. Loomis is an agricultural economist with extensive experience in public lands management. He claims to rep- resent the "social sciences." However, the book is really about the application of economics to land use planning and man- agement. Integration is achieved through economic theory and the application of the techniques of economic analysis. The rest of the social sciences-politics, administration, law, or sociology do not exist. The book presents basic background concepts, including the economic rationale for the existence of public lands. It describes the laws and agencies which govern them, and has separate chapters on the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and National Park Service (NPS). The core of the book is a series of chapters on economic models and techniques used in planning for and managing public lands. Non-market val- uation, optimization models, benefit-cost analysis, and re- gional economic analysis using input-output models are all covered. A final, very short chapter is a reflective essay entitled "Lessons from current public land management and direc- tions for the future: ecosystem management." As Loomis points out, the planning process imposed by the National Forest Management Act (NFMA), under the regime of "multiple use," seems to require the use of economics as the vocabulary of integration, in its specification, as a major objective of managing national forests "towards the desired result of maximizing net public benefits" (quote from: Forest Service. 1982. National forest land and resource management planning. Federal Register 47, no 190: 43026-43052. Sep- tember 30). However, the dominance of economic criteria poses serious problems. Although Loomis tries to distinguish between "positive," or "scientific" analysis on the one hand and normative, value-laden assertions on the other, his eco- nomics are, in fact, highly prescriptive. He chides those who question the equity of the economic techniques used, "As cruel as this extreme example sounds, we must remember what Benefit Cost Analysis (BCA) is all about: it is economic efficiency, not equity. This is the logic of the marketplace. All dollars have equal power in the market." However, as a "pos- itive" social scientist, the author's task is to describe the logic</page><page sequence="2">1856 REVIEWS Ecology, Vol. 75, No. 6 of the market and of measures such as BCA which are based upon it, not to defend them or to claim, for them, some higher order of truth. The market is a human, social invention. It performs many functions well and many others dismally. To the extent that it is insensitive to issues like equity, which are very real, it is simply useless for policy. It is on this fundamental question of value, or of the basic nature of "public good," that Loomis' economics, like that of many of his colleagues, consistently loses sight of the dis- tinction between normative and positive assertions. Econom- ics has two realms, the financial and the economic. The fi- nancial is simple enough, involving simple accounting of monetary transactions. The economic realm pretends to mea- sure fundamental, underlying value, to society as a whole, as it were. Even before markets were created, it was there, and even where markets do not exist, it lurks. It is this underlying economic value which is to be estimated by the techniques of economic analysis. Optimizing it, by definition, optimizes social well-being. Then it is further assumed that, when well- being is optimized in this sense, land management decisions either are, or should be, most acceptable to the public. Wheth- er they are is, of course, an empirical question. In chiding those who prefer to hold to "symbolic," or other values, Loomis does, in effect, admit that it is frequently not valid empirically. That land management decisions based upon such an eco- nomic optimization of social well-being should be most ac- ceptable to the public is a normative assertion, one that Loom- is makes repeatedly, when he distinguishes between "real," economically determined value and the "symbolic" values to which people frequently actually adhere, values that are clear- ly regarded as irrational and defective. Thus we find, in the guise of "positive" economic theory, a particular theory of human behavior and one, particular, economic view of the public good. Students will not learn anything from this book about alternative views. Nor do they receive any tools with which to understand what to do when the public insists upon sticking with its "irrational," and "symbolic" values. This starkly displays the need for a broader social science, one that takes cultural, social, and political factors as seriously as eco- nomic factors, that does not presume the latter to contain the former, or that the only "anthropomorphic" view of public lands management is view of economics. Unfortunately, such a broader social science will not be found here. A number of other weaknesses result from the book's nar- rowness of focus. There is virtually no discussion of the po- litical processes-including public involvement-in land management planning and project implementation; the role of the courts is almost completely overlooked; and appro- priate citations to federal laws and regulations are not pro- vided. The economic theory of public good is the only ra- tionale for public ownership of land that is presented and Loomis seems to believe that the solution to the escalating dilemma of land use decision-making is more complex eco- nomic analysis. Finally, no coherent ecological perspective to land use management is developed in the book. Under eco- system management it seems reasonable to suppose that at least three paradigms, the resource extraction paradigm of the "multi-use" regime presented here, an ecological paradigm, and a socio-political'paradigm will have to be articulated and integrated into a true "social ecology." This book is still thor- oughly embedded in the resource extraction "multi-use" re- gime, even though, to his credit, Loomis does briefly present contrasting ecological perspectives from time to time through- out the book. But these are fundamental weaknesses of eco- nomics, not merely of Loomis, or this book. Indeed, it is the lucidity of his discussion that has made them evident. And, he does, at least, introduce alternative views at a number of crucial points. So, if we were teaching a course on the topic of public lands management, we would use the book, but not without additional materials to provide a broader perspective. The major strengths of the book are the good overview of the history of public lands management, of the relevant statutes, and of the procedures currently in use; and the comprehensive treatment of economics and the techniques of economic anal- ysis for public lands management. Loomis confronts a dilemma in presenting the analytic techniques. On the one hand, the book is likely already to be quite challenging to students taking courses in land use man- agement. Still, the treatments may not be thorough enough to prepare students to apply the techniques professionally. Perhaps that's okay. They can, after all, learn more in spe- cialized courses or, more likely, depend upon specialists in practice. And, by putting the techniques into the broader con- text of public lands management and the relevant economic theory, Loomis has not only stimulated our criticisms, but has provided a coherent conceptual framework.
