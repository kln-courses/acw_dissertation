<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS LIVES &amp; LETTERS The Collapse of Orthodoxy: The Intellec tual Ordeal of George Frederick Holmes, by Neal C. Gillespie. Remembered more for his defense of sla very and of a rigidly orthodox Christianity than for his career as a social critic and teacher, George F. Holmes does not sug gest a particularly admirable personality. When Holmes's notions on slavery or on Christianity are presented within his nine teenth-century context, it is recognized that while abhorrent to modern thinking they were feasible alternatives in his own day. This first full-scale biography of Holmes attempts the latter portrait. Biographical de tails on Holmes's early life are sketchy, but more significant and occupying a central portion of the book are discussions of Holmes's writings on August Com te's posi tivism and on slavery. Holmes's life was one of continual financial, vocational, and do mestic frustration and when, at the end of a long career, he accepts a Darwinian quali fication of his former religious orthodoxy, Gillespie suggests that this is the ultimate frustration. Throughout the book, how ever, Holmes's life is that of a scholar who, having weighed the evidence, accepted the conservative alternatives. One wonders why, therefore, Holmes's final philosophi cal position is not a demonstration of his maturing and evolving scholarly judgment rather than the ultimate frustration. Virginia #9.50 The Letter book of Eliza Lucas Pinckney, 1739-1762, edited by Elise Pinckney. Eliza Lucas Pinckney lived a full life in both the man's and the woman's world. In 1738 she moved from her native Antigua to South Carolina where, when only six teen, she began directing operations on three plantations. On one of them she in troduced indigo and pioneered in its manu facture. Shortly thereafter she married Charles Pinckney and moved to his nearby plantation, where she continued her agri cultural experiments and gave birth to two Revolutionary leaders, Charles Cotesworth and Thomas Pinckney. Through her letter book Eliza's strong will, her self-discipline, Ixxxviii her doubts, her triumphs, and above all else her devotion to her father, to her husband, and to her children become clear. Crisply edited, the letterbook is clear to the modern eye yet retains its eighteenth-century flavor. Both as a source material and as delightful reading it is a welcome addition to the li brary of anyone interested in colonial America. North Carolina $&lt;).&lt;)5 The Life of Benjamin Banneker, by Silvio A. Bedini. Benjamin Banneker, a free-born Mary land tobacco planter, became at age 58 a student of astronomy and mathematics and shortly thereafter the author of an almanac. This, his anti-slavery activities, and perhaps his participation in the surveying of the District of Columbia have occasionally earned him a footnote, but not until now a full-length, scholarly biography. Bedini fills this void and more. He not only describes and analyzes Banneker the man and his ac complishments, but more importantly he brings to life the society within which Ban neker lived and worked. Every facet of it, its economy, its social relationships, and its simple everyday events are united to give the reader an awareness of what it meant to be a free black in a slave society, a gifted but largely unwanted intellect. Beyond this, and of particular value to the scholar, are the extensive notes and bibliography. Scribner's $14.95 Down to Now, by Pat Watters. A long career as a journalist and as an officer of the Southern Regional Council has given Pat Watters a suitable perspec tive for comment on the Southern civil rights movement. Watters believes that the "movement," as led by Martin Luther King, was more than a secular drive for votes and freedom; he feels the movement was an intense spiritual uplift on the part of South ern blacks and many Southern whites. When that spirit clashed with the forces of Southern bigotry and assassination or with the force of political compromise, it was at first reinforced but was gradually crushed. Today, the spirit of the civil rights movement is disconcertingly fragmented. The message of the book takes the form of</page><page sequence="2">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS a stream of consciousness style of writing; it often rambles and is often confusing. The work is no academic study; Watters' con clusions are not buttressed by footnotes. Rather, this book is an account, a series of observations, that somehow captures the initial thrust of the struggle for civil rights and somehow gives one that feeling of dis appointment and frustration that seems to pervade the "movement" as it moves into the iç7o's. Pantheon $8.9 5 The Quality of Hurt, by Chester Himes. Chester Himes has been kicking around —and kicked around—the world of Ameri can letters since 1934 when, while he was still a convict, his first harsh stories of prison life appeared in Esquire. A writer of great integrity, he has somehow managed to publish fifteen novels and to develop a substantial following in Europe, but he has remained a curiously ambiguous figure in the United States, where neither white nor black audiences have been able to accept him fully. Admired at times for his ruthless honesty, he has more often been the subject of intemperate critical abuse. It is ironic, but indicative of his frustrating homelessness at home, that he has probably been best known in this country for a bit of semi pornographic fluff called "Pinktoes." Read ing Himes's brutal fiction is always like being slammed against a wall by a thug—a fright ening, but unmistakably authentic experi ence—and those familiar with his achieve ment might entertain hopes that this first volume of his autobiography (covering the years 1909-1954) will help to create the large audience he has long seemed about to reach. Probably it won't. "The Quality of Hurt" is bulging with literary anecdotes— the story, for instance, of the famous con versation between Richard Wright and James Baldwin in Paris—and with fascinat ing accounts of the biographical back ground of Himes's own work, but in its essence it is blunt and hard, a book to make your teeth ache. Himes shows no slackening of his determination to commit literary violence upon his reader. "A fighter fights," he says. "A writer writes." For the most part, he is content to record here, usu ally without interpretation or overt protest, the simple details of his experience as an American black man, living a life that too often becomes nothing more than a per petual renewal of that radical "hurt" which is far beyond pain, a moronic violence done to the spirit itself. Himes's tone, in fact, occasionally comes close to the dull animal whine of a Céline, but he is no quitter, and if he seems at times to be on the verge of succumbing to moral lobotomy, his refusal to be less than honest finally pulls him through with his values and his humanity intact. That triumph—of which Himes takes no particular notice—makes this an im portant book, a moving rediscovery of man's always surprising ability to survive and be good in a brutal world. Doubleday $7.95 Eliot and His Age, by Russell Kirk. Russell Kirk was a friend of Eliot's later years. Personal affection here finds a fit ting tribute. Within the framework of a biography, this big and eloquent book deals with the theme of Eliot's moral imagina tion in the twentieth century. As might be expected from the author of "The Conser vative Mind" there is a searching and sym pathetic examination of Eliot's views on culture, class, and social order; skilful and informed use is made of the little-known editorial comments in the Criterion to illus trate the poet's developing view of the interwar political scene. There is shrewd appraisal of personality and of the rôle of sex in the poems and plays. Chiefly, Kirk's study has the merit of tracing convincingly the full development of the Christian poet, the continuity of his thought, his battle with his age, and his crowning success—a true success based on the ultimate triumph of intellectual honesty. Random $12.50 Samuel Johnson: A Personality in Conflict, by George Irwin. In this highly independent work the late George Irwin presents an extremely inter esting analysis of Johnson's lifelong neuro sis, and of the eventual recovery which he achieved under the care of his friend Mrs. Thrale. Some psychoanalytic terminology is used, but by no means in excess, and Irwin displays an impressive mastery of all available sources—some of them not at all well known—in supporting his argument. Ixxocioc</page><page sequence="3">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS The details of his study are too complex to be summarized here, but anyone inter ested in Johnson may be assured that he will find much of value in this book. Oxford $8 Flaubert the Master, by Enid Starkie. This volume, centering on the life and literary achievement of Flaubert after the publication of "Madame Bovary" to his death in 1880, complements the late Pro fessor Starkie's earlier study, "Flaubert, the Making of the Master." From nearly every standpoint, these pages constitute an eminently satisfying account of Flaubert, his political views, his character, and his concern with his art and craft as a novelist. This is a skillfully written biography that coincidentally also provides a surprisingly complete account of the growth and de velopment of the French and European novel from 1857 to 1880. Particularly ef fective is Part Two: The Third Republic, which discusses Flaubert after the critical failure of "L'Education sentimentale." Dr. Starkie's account of the situation surround ing the "Trois Contes," "Bouvard et Pécuchet" and the novelist's eventual death is conveyed in particularly telling and mov ing terms. Together with the first volume, "Flaubert the Master" constitutes a fitting monument to Enid Starkie's dedication and perspicacity as a distinguished scholar and critic. Atheneum $10 Voyeur Voyant: a Portrait of Louis-Ferdi nand Céline, by Erika Ostrovsky. Céline died in 1961 on the same day as Hemingway and in the respects paid to the latter his reputation was almost ignored. Curiously, for now "Voyage au bout de la nuit" can be seen as a seminal work for the present age, its extreme nihilism uncontami nated by stoic posturing or mauvais foi. The author has already published the first full-length critical study in English: "Cé line and His Vision." No doubt that is why this book is purely biographical and con tains only passing comments on the novels. It is an intimate and impressionistic portrait, favouring the present tense, the intuitive reconstruction of the atmosphere of a per sonality, in fact the world of Céline medi ated through a harsh, staccato Céline style. XC Every novelistic device except the famous three dots . . . But this is a book which students and devotees of Céline will return to for its faithful documentation (the inter views with Madame Céline and friends), full references, and, not least, for some marvelous photographs of Céline, of Lu cette, and of the now destroyed house in Bellevue. Random $10 In Exile: Essays, Reflections and Letters, 1933-194I, by Willy Brandt. Chancellor Willy Brandt was an anti Nazi activist at age nineteen when Hitler came to power in Germany. He escaped to Norway where he earned his living as a journalist on a daily paper but also devoted much time to the socialist movement, to which he was deeply committed. Deprived of German citizenship in 1938, he grate fully accepted Norwegian citizenship. With the Nazi occupation of Norway he escaped to Sweden where he served the Norwegian resistance movement in a journalistic ca pacity until the end of the war, when he returned to Berlin as press attaché to the Norwegian military mission. His citizen ship restored, he rose rapidly to promi nence in the government of West Berlin and nationally in the Social Democratic party. During this period he brought a number of libel actions against political de tractors who alleged that during his émigré years he had actually borne arms against the fatherland. This book, widely circulated in Germany, is aimed at clarifying his ac tivities, thoughts, and writings during the exile years. Selections from his publications and diaries, and letters to friends, family, and associates, document his views on the issues of the war, his activities in exile cir cles, and his personal life during this period. Persons interested in European affairs can see how this democratic socialist developed into a pragmatic, patient, and innovative national leader, a worthy successor to Konrad Adenauer. This record of his thoughts and actions from "outside" is suf ficiently intimate to hold the attention even of the general reader. Pennsylvania $9.50 Riding the Storm, 1956-19^9, by Harold Macmillan. The fourth volume of Macmillan's mem</page><page sequence="4">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS oirs takes us through his early years as Prime Minister. The major theme is his efforts to keep Britain from becoming a second-class power during his tenure in office. His major adversary in this effort often was the United States. The clash of interest with the United States Govern ment, starting with the Suez crisis, leads to some of the most interesting statements about notable world leaders. He believes, for instance, that Dulles's destruction of Britain's efforts to bluff Egypt was pos sibly a result of cancer affecting Dulles's mind. On the whole Dulles and the United States are seen as a constant source of trouble for Macmillan. The memoirs are filled with pictures of other world leaders the traveling Prime Minister encountered, but unfortunately none reach the level of commentary reserved for the especially disliked Dulles. Harper &amp; Row $15 Abelard and Heloise, by D. W. Robertson, Jr. It was inevitable that D. W. Robertson, bête noire to a generation of conservative medievalists, should write a book about the twelfth-century intellectual maverick Abe lard. The title's inversion of the post Romantic collocation, Heloise and Abelard, suggests immediately how this book dif fers from earlier studies. Robertson denies Heloise's authorship of the letters attrib uted to her and concentrates on Abelard as autobiographer, theologian, and spiritual advisor of Heloise. The "Letters," far from romantic exchanges between tragically sep arated lovers, were in fact intended to be ironic and witty instructions to the nuns under the guidance of Heloise at the Para clete. The demythologizing of the "History of My Calamities" and "Letters" which re sults from such analysis is almost certainly sound (The Gilson-Waddell depiction of the two as Love's saints is intrinsically im probable), but Robertson's account makes the relationship more pedestrian in its morality than it need be. The book in the end is not really about its ostensible sub jects but, like the "Preface to Chaucer," is part of a continuing discussion of the changes in Western intellectual history since the eighteenth century and the impli xcii cations of those changes for literary schol arship. Dial $7.95 Béla Bartok Letters, collected, selected, edi ted, and annotated by Jânos Demény. This, the first collection of Bartok's cor respondence to be published in English, contains nearly three hundred letters rang ing in date from 1899, when the composer was eighteen, to 1945, the year of his death. About two thirds of the letters have been translated, apparently most successfully, from the original Hungarian by Balabân and Farkas, the translations revised by Eliz abeth West and Colin Mason. Many of the letters document the composer's keen, in defatigable, and abiding interest in record ing and preserving folk music, principally, but not exclusively, Hungarian, Slovak, and Rumanian; others give invaluable informa tion about the text and performance of sev eral of his compositions such as the first and fourth string quartets and the solo violin sonata. The selection admirably re veals the penetrating intellect, the absolute integrity, the personal and artistic struggle of one of the century's most important geniuses, and will be both essential and en grossing for layman and professional alike. St. Martin's $20 HISTORY The Anatomy of the Confederate Congress, by Thomas B. Alexander and Richard E. Beringer. This incisive look at the Confederate Congress in action shatters the rhetoric of those who would still argue the unity of the Southern cause. Using a roll-call analysis of the votes of the Confederate Congresses, the authors conclude that a delegate's atti tude toward secession, his former party affiliation, and the location of his residence (whether in Federal occupation zones or in Confederate territory) were the strongest determinants of roll-call voting behavior. Tracing these and other determinants enables the authors to prove that the sup posed monolith of Southern sectionalism was little more than a "thinly veneered localism." It was a localism that seriously</page><page sequence="5">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS undermined the willingness of the Confed erate leadership to sacrifice for the common cause. Although the narrative (which is fortunately supplemented by numerous tables and appendices) is unexciting, one must admit that the book is an important methodological and historiographical con tribution to Civil War history. Vanderbilt $10 The Image of Lincoln in the South, by Michael Davis. The object of this study is to explore and document the changing Southern atti tudes toward Lincoln from the eve of the Civil War to the turn of the century. In i860 the South viewed Lincoln as a "prairie buffoon" or "pliant tool of ambi tious demagogues." During the war, while Lincoln was ascending to greatness in the North, in the South his image changed from that of fool to monster. With Lin coln's assassination and the "evils" of Con gressional Reconstruction, the image of Lincoln underwent another transformation in the South. This last view of Lincoln reached its culmination with the New South spokesmen who used the "spirit of Lincoln to seal the bond of new-found brotherhood between North and South." Davis ably documents the shift in the South's attitude toward Lincoln, and in doing so, adds a dimension to our under standing of the Lincoln legend. This slim volume is both thoroughly researched and well written, with appeal for both the pro fessional historian and interested reader. Tennessee $7.95 The Partisan Spirit: Kentucky Politics, '779-1792&gt; by Patricia Watlington. Although the subject is the sparsely set tled region of late eighteenth-century Ken tucky, this book should prove an important one for students of early American history and politics. Beginning with a description of the unbelievably complex land system that Kentuckians inherited from Virginia, Ms. Watlington traces the origins of fac tional parties to the inequitable operation of the land laws. With the movement for statehood, further factionalization takes place and three parties form around atti tudes toward statehood. Utilizing brief bi ographical sketches, the author traces the evolution of these parties. The importance of the book lies not only in tracing the events that led to Kentucky's statehood but also in the argument that Kentucky's political parties were formed in the 1780's in response to local needs and that these Confederation parties show continuity with the Federalists and Jeffersonians of the first American party system. Atheneum $12.95 The Great Revival, 1787-1805: The Origins of the Southern Evangelical Mind, by John Boles. In seeking to define the Southerner or the Southern way of life, observers often in clude fundamentalism in religion as an iden tifying characteristic. Assuming such char acterization to be true, this book traces the origins of the Southern evangelical mind to the Great Revival of 1787-1805. In discussing the origins, growth, and theological disputes that led to the Great Revival, Mr. Boles performs a valuable service. A revivalism that was formerly associated with Kentucky and the upper Midwest is here shown to have spread throughout the settled South as well. However, the author does an in justice both to his evidence and to his reader in his concluding efforts to make Southern fundamentalism a legacy of the Great Revival. The fact that revivalism swept across the entire country while fun damentalism did not is enough to suggest more complex forces at work on the South ern mind. Kentucky $10 The Memphis Commercial-Appeal: The History of a Southern Newspaper, by Thomas Harrison Baker. Newspapers have long been valuable but dangerously biased sources of informa tion for the social scientist or historian. In spite of their importance as sources, news papers have rarely been the subjects of study in themselves. A newspaper biography is, however, of extreme importance not only in tracing the changing patterns of news coverage but also in providing the reader with the necessary perspective for understanding the bias of his source. Rap idly covering more than a century of jour nalistic development, Mr. Baker has written an admirable newspaper biography. By xciii</page><page sequence="6">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS tracing the ideological maturation of the paper from a party sheet of the Memphis Jacksonians to a widely known regional news medium, Baker has given perspective. Furthermore, the narrative comments on the beginnings of wire service news cov erage, the women's section, and the sports pages, as well as other changes in journalis tic practices. Central to the book is the transformation of the paper's management from a printing concern's political voice to a chain-operated business enterprise. While Baker is not the first to write a newspaper biography, he is certainly one of the few to do so. With the numbers of regional and national newspapers, it is hoped that others will follow his lead. Louisiana $12.50 The Disruption of the Solid South, by George Brown Tindall. With the 1972 presidential elections ap . proaching, and with "psephology" (voting analysis) reaching its quadrennial peak, these brief and gracefully written essays have remarkable pertinence. First delivered in 1970 as the Mercer University Lamar Memorial Lectures, they appear now as a reminder that Southern strategies by Re publican political aspirants are not new. From Rutherford Hayes to Richard Nixon, a Southern strategy, in one form or another, has been pursued. Unique about the 1970's is the fact that the once "Solid South" is disrupting (a process that began in 1948) and may well be on the verge of viable two-party politics again. Georgia $4 Black Women in White America: A Docu mentary History, by Gerda Lerner. How delightful to read such a carefully focused and forthright rendering of testi mony from black women! Ms. Lerner has produced, after four years of indefatigable effort, a valuable source for the scholar concerned with Afro-American studies and with the history of American women. As many of the documents are spread about the country, not all collated, assembled, or edited, her achievement is even more re markable. The strength of this collection lies in its balance and diversity. Awareness of the wide spectrum of opinion, activism, and approach among black women comes through to the reader when, for example, ccciv the utterances of Ida Wells Barnett, anti lynching journalist, and Mary Church Ter rell, clubwoman and educator, appear beside those of Harriet Tubman, of Underground Railroad fame, and Dara Abubakari (Vir ginia E. Y. Collins), Vice-President of the separatist Republic of New Africa. The book is timely, the interpretative introductory essays far from timid. Ms. Lerner's cover age of substantive themes in the black ex perience challenges old myths of the black matriarchy, the "bad" black woman, with evidence from the usually uncited perspec tive of the women themselves. Among the ever-increasing wheat and chaff of publi cations in the fields of Afro-American studies and women studies, this work un mistakably beckons the reader as new wheat. Pantheon $12.95 No Peace Beyond the Line: The English in the Caribbean, 1624-1690, by Carl and Roberta Bridenbaugh. In this second volume of the Briden baughs' "Origins of the American People," the "vexed and troubled Englishmen" of volume one are found as migrants to and settlers in the islands of the Caribbean. Thematically the authors demonstrate that while finding an acceptable money crop and an astounding material success, the English settlers destroyed the basis of a viable cultural transplantation. Because males were predominant among the white bondsmen, the English family was not in stitutionalized in the Caribbean; because the colonies were settled during a time of religious unrest, the church similarly failed to transplant. These social failures among the white settlers are contrasted with the increasingly successful (by 1690) transplan tation of a black culture. By 1690, Carib bean society was formed but for the whites who had failed socially and for the blacks who were still enslaved, there was "no peace." Underlying this pervasive theme is a graceful narrative describing the growth of a sugar culture, the origins of black ser vitude, and the institution of white slavery. Detailed evidence and valuable interpreta tions mark this as an important book not only as a sequel to the first volume but also as a work of scholarship that will stand on its own. Oxford $12.50</page><page sequence="7">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS A Secret War: Americans in China, 1944 1945, by Oliver J. Caldwell. The author, a China-born OSS officer, presents himself as a "triple agent" who plotted to outwit Chiang Kai-shek's "Himmler," Tai Li, and to replace Chiang with a popular régime that would have saved China from Communism. In fact this turns out to have been a rather trivial inci dent which is submerged in a hodgepodge of information and misinformation on Chi nese history, society, and politics and the author's wartime adventures. The style is anecdotal, chatty, and disjointed. However, the serious reader will discover revealing insights into the muddled mind of an anti Communist liberal in the service of the CIA's progenitor. Southern Illinois $5.95 The Double-Cross System in the War of 1939 to 194s, by J. C. Masterman. This brief, engrossing piece of contem porary history, Sir John's report of 1945 now made public, documents lucidly and directly how British intelligence services came to control German espionage in Britain during World War II, not just with an occasional ruse de guerre but indeed on a broad, strategic scale that now seems in credible. From the inception of the XX Committee with its constant problems of maintaining and controlling German agents and building credibility in Berlin, up to the ultimate payoffs, the deceptions surround ing the Sicilian and Normandy invasions, Sir John weaves a scholarly thriller admit tedly not more captivating than the gaudi est spy novels, but nonetheless with an ap peal all its own. Yale $6.95 Victor's Justice, by Richard Minear. In the preface to this book, the first full length study in English of the International War Crimes Trial held in Japan at the end of World War II, Professor Minear states forthrightly that his aim is "to demolish the credibility of the . . . trial and its ver dict." The attack which follows is three pronged. Minear argues that the trial had a shaky basis in international law, that it suf fered from fundamental procedural flaws, and that its verdict (which found all twenty-five surviving defendants guilty) rested on a distorted view of Japanese his cccvi tory to 1945. Minear does not attempt to defend in toto the actions of Japan's leaders during the war, but he does conclude that they were legally innocent of the charges against them in 1946. The book rescues the subject of the Tokyo trial from twenty four years of scholarly neglect in the West and raises some serious questions about the validity of war crimes trials in general. But although it is certainly well worth reading, it is too brief and occasionally too polemical in tone to be entirely persuasive. Princeton $7.95 The Revolt of the Judges by A. Lloyd Moote. The primary concern of the Parlement of Paris during the Fronde was to prevent the crown's continuing reliance on inten dants and extra-legal tax-collecting meth ods. Having accomplished this objective through the Treaty of Reuil in 1649, the Parlement was more successful in protect ing the results of the treaty throughout the reign of Louis XIV, according to Moote, than has generally been supposed by his torians. Princeton $15 Jesuits &amp; Jacobins by Paul P. Bernard. In this brief work the author attempts to relate the Enlightened despotism of Joseph II to the Enlightenment by describing the ideals and aspirations of the bureaucrats and literati who supported the emperor. These ideals were influenced by contacts with the French and German Enlightenment as well as by a growing awareness within Austria of the need for reform of Church and State. Illinois $7.50 Germany in Our Time, by Alfred Grosser. Alfred Grosser, German born, but a French citizen and a distinguished scholar and writer, is France's leading interpreter of political developments in contemporary Germany. Translated from the French, "Germany in Our Time" is the most com prehensive, detailed, and reliable account we possess of the evolution of the "two Ger manies" since World War II. Grosser's theme that 1945 was as much a break in German history as 1917 in Russian history is convincingly sustained. In 1945, occupied Germany became, if not a zero, then at</page><page sequence="8">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS most a pawn in international politics, and the consequences of this dependence per sist to this day in the existence of two Germanies. Grosser's work is one of the few that treats the German Democratic Republic equally with the Federal Republic of West Germany. Of the eleven chapters that comprise the volume four deal with the occupation period, five treat major as pects of West German democracy, two are devoted to East Germany and foreign af fairs, and a final chapter offers a summary and conclusions. Especially notable is the treatment of the impact of the occupation on the people, the economic and social forces that operated after 1945, moral and intellectual trends, and developments in the "Other Germany." Often an outsider's opinion is little more than a polemical one. That cannot be said of this sober, objective work, which will appeal to a general audi ence as well as to students of contemporary affairs. An excellent critical bibliography represents a valuable bonus for the research scholar and student. Praeger $12.50 The Thirty Years War, by J. V. Polisensky. This is not, of course, a book about Vietnam, but future generations will be for tunate if some historian produces a history of the conflict in Southeast Asia that is as thorough, incisive, and wise as Professor Polisensky's account of the war of 1618 1648. The story has frequently been told, but the residue in the textbooks is largely concerned with Wallenstein, Gustavus Adolphus, Richelieu, and others of the great commanders and statesmen. This account gets down to what would in the Western context be called the "grass roots," and we are made to see this last of the great "religi ous" wars as a complex social and economic struggle. California $10 The Making of Medieval Spain, by Gabriel Jackson. By a recognized authority on Spain's last civil war and her twentieth-century history in general, this compact readable survey of fers an informative and consistently thoughtful introduction to a large subject As a disciple of Américo Castro, Professor Jackson is particularly concerned to do full justice to the interplay of all three central formative elements—Islamic, Jewish, and Christian—that he sees as explaining the formation of a distinctly Spanish civiliza tion. As usual with such efforts in our time, the Christians fare rather less well than the minority blocs; but despite some imbalance this results in a generally sound analysis over some eight hundred years of the com plex political, social, economic, and cul tural forces that underlie Spain's leadership of the West in the sixteenth century. As with other titles in Geoffrey Barraclough's "History of European Civilization Library," illustrations abound; they tend to be both fresh and well reproduced. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich $6.95 The Spanish Church and the Papacy in the Thirteenth Century, by Peter Linehan. This is one of the few recent major books on medieval Spanish church history of which it can be said that it rests upon thorough archival investigations, escapes conventional biases whether Catholic or Protestant, and allows the documents to give us their vivid picture of ecclesiastical life and problems at the height of the Ibe rian Middle Ages. In addition, the work displays an insight, an unfailing zest, and a lively wit that make it absolutely unique in its field: at once emphatically scholarly and irrefutably revisionist, the fresh breeze sweeping through the hothouse. Here we behold a Spanish Church very different from that of the traditional view: domi nated by, not dominant over, the rising medieval state; displaying chronic, violently nationalistic opposition to papal authority and to Rome's reformist and financial pres sures; sunk in relaxed spirituality, discipli nary chaos, and clerical concubinage, against which the strenuous efforts of a series of able bishops achieve only limited success. In its detailed treatment of the grave economic crises confronted by this supposedly wealthy church, its many strug gles against the crown and papal tiara, and the activities of Spanish churchmen at the papal curia, Dr. Linehan's book must rank as one of the most notable contributions in many years to the history of both Spain and the church in the Middle Ages. Cambridge $18.50 xcuii</page><page sequence="9">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS The Kurbskii-Groznyi Apocrypha, by Ed ward L. Keenan. The subtitle of this book is "The Seven teenth-Century Genesis of the 'Corres pondence' Attributed to Prince A. M. Kurbskii and Tsar Ivan IV," and that indi cates a complex piece of myth-shattering. Historians have long identified Ivan IV ("The Terrible") as the first Russian po litical thinker of any stature. On the basis of an exhaustive study of the archival evi dence, Professor Keenan has determined that the earliest letters in the famous corre spondence actually date from 1623-1625. His findings necessitate a re-examination of half a century of Russian history. Harvard $10 The Origins of Capitalism in Russia, by Joseph T. Fuhrmann. When English and Dutch seafarers found the northern passage to Muscovy in the sixteenth century, their impact upon that closed, semi-oriental society was in some ways as profound as was Dewey's upon Japan. For the first time Muscovites dared to look outside their kremlins (i.e., citadels) and trade with foreign heretics. Western technology flowed into the country, and by the time Peter the Great came along at the end of the seventeenth century the foundations of a modern economy had been at least partially laid. Professor Fuhrmann's book constitutes a useful and very readable introduction to a fascinating subject. Quadrangle $12.50 FICTION The Glory of Hera, by Caroline Gordon. Gods and mortals derived from the myths and fables of ancient Greece are in voked in Miss Gordon's new book, written in her graceful style with enough persua siveness to give life to the old legends and an air of credulity to the belief in supreme beings with anthropomorphic attributes. Larger meanings aside, her surface treatment is concerned with much amorous dalliance, feasting, and drinking by the gods, with the goddesses modestly occupying themselves in domestic pursuits such as spinning and a tangential participation in the frequent cere monial sacrifices to Zeus. Both seem to lead exceedingly dull and prosaic lives in their xcviii Olympian retreats, occasionally diverted by what appear to be gratuitous murders and a good deal of mischief, not all innocent. Earthbound creatures contented themselves with endless wars. Heracles is, however, the protagonist. His possibly apocryphal thirteenth labor as here outlined was ac complished not in one night, but on succes sive evenings; his feat was nevertheless re markable and quite enough to prove his stalwart nature as a demi-god, thus leaving him forever after an object of admiration and envy for generations of mankind. Doubleday Î7.95 War Games, by Wright Morris. All of the author's considerable skill and cunning have been compressed in a novella written twenty years ago and never pub lished for reasons as bewildering as they are incomprehensible, for here he has crystal lized those facets of his writing that have distinguished his memorable career as a literary artist. His ability to suggest a story immeasurably deeper in significance than the words themselves convey, his facility in projecting a sense of foreboding and angst, his capacity for clothing his deceptively simple tale in prose concealing more than it reveals, all plainly show the hand of an expert craftsman well equipped to dominate his readers much to their esthetic advan tage. Black Sparrow $15; paper $4 Tangier Buzzless Flies, by John Hopkins. Although Mr. Hopkins' book is supplied with a full complement of more or less stal wart heroes, a bit battered and careworn by the desert life they pursue in north Africa, the central interest here lies in the Sahara itself, its heat, sandy wastes, and filth, along with the Moslem resignation to fate ac cepted without question by its inhabitants, hardly able in any event to lift themselves out of the lethargy and indolence induced by their habitual dependence upon hashish. Men and women appear and fade away in these pages and are in fact hardly distin guishable one from the other in a society where differences in sex become matters of little importance. Story is of no conse quence to the author. He is content to out line his characters with some sharpness, em phasizing always the futility of their lives.</page><page sequence="10">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS What counts above all is the Sahara, ever shifting, inevitably concealing even the graves of men whose lives were lost in their feeble attempts to conquer it. Atheneum $7.95 America, My Wilderness, by Frederic Prokosch. Tag ends out of classical mythology serve to give some substance to the new Pro kosch book, more a brilliantly executed travelogue than a novel wherein the author in episodic fashion traces the journey of his amorphous hero across the United States, back and forth, up and down, in a fruitless search for a country closer to cloudland than America. Color, sound, and beauty often juxtaposed with ugliness all help to enchant the reader and lose him in a world of unutterable strangeness despite a haunt ing familiarity here and there accented by the inclusion of place names readily identifi able but rejected out of hand all the same as mere intrusions designed to give veri similitude otherwise lacking to a tale of no considerable validity. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux $6.95 An Accidental Man, by Iris Murdoch. Once again we are in Miss Murdoch's world of kaleidoscopic pairings and faded gentility and exquisite sensibilities. Austin Gibson Gray may appropriate the distinc tion of the title for himself, but his fellow characters are alike making lives from the swirl of accidents around him. Miss Mur doch alternates chapters of party repartee with philosophical reveries; she takes a fling at the epistolary novel; she offers a comic vision of randomness in a plot replete with deaths and near-deaths. It is perhaps her wittiest novel since "Under the Net." Viking $7.$5 The Charisma Campaigns, by Jack Mat thews. In forthright and captivating fashion the author tells a simple tale about ordinary people: a used car dealer with apparently hypnotic powers over prospective buyers, an academic figure of dubious authenticity, and a few foils of recognizable incompe tence in the persons having nominal ca pacities as salesmen. From such common place, out-of-hand materials the author unfolds a yarn of compulsive interest. This is a "fun" book of no pretensions and con siderable charm. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich $5.95 Concessions of Cherubino, by Bertha Har ris. Of Miss Harris' talent there can be few doubts, for she displays her prodigal gifts in generous fashion, clothing her narrative in a miasma of ambiguity, allegory, and indirection. Her ability to conjure up mood is remarkable; no less is her capacity in de lineating the inexpressible. She can write about dreadful deeds with an air of irre proachable innocence. In her strength lies her weakness, though, for many readers will doubtless become impatient with her circumlocutions and with the amorphous quality of her writing. Her book, in brief, is overwritten, for all its manifest literary virtues. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich $5.95 Three Wogs, by Alexander Theroux. Once the reader has become accustomed to the flamboyancies of Mr. Theroux' extravagant, bombastic style, he can settle down to the feast spread before him and enjoy bit by bit the coruscations, the pre cisions, and the persuasiveness of an acute playful intelligence all too ready to cozen the unwary. Three long short stories con stitute the volume. Each is placed in Lon don; all are concerned with racial impacts upon a Chinese, a Hindu, and a man of color out of Africa and their influence in turn upon whites. While the author's sense of the absurd is as broadly conveyed as his satirical intent what distinguishes his work is an astounding ability to absorb an alien culture so quickly and accurately as Mr. Theroux has done, so that one soon forgets the author's American antecedents and ac cepts him as an authentic Briton, born and bred. As a striking tour de force the book is incomparable. Gambit $5.95 Waking Slow, by Michael Mewshaw. In a routine yarn about contemporary attitudes toward life and the carnality that passes for love among youngsters today, Mr. Mewshaw has some claim to attention, even though his story offers no solutions to C</page><page sequence="11">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS problems presented, resolves nothing, and essentially ends where it began. What com mends his book is an enviable fluency in narration and a naturalism in handling dia logue. Random $5.95 The Steps of the Sun, by Olivia Davis. This nice, fat novel is built on the "Grand HoteP'-"Ship of Fools" model. That is, a disparate group of people is brought to a small but very select hotel at a Mexican resort and events are allowed to take their course. It sounds bland, but, even though the plot does not progress, it is full of interest, strange character ideas, and un suspected vagaries. It is, in fact, completely pleasurable. Houghton Mifflin $6.95 Mock Turtle Soup, by Peter Neill. Slightly more than one hundred pages occupy the author in his experimental, sur realistic novella about escape—escape from self and reality into an imaginative world high in its intensity, replete with symbolism, and obscure in its meaning. So fragmentary an example imposes difficulties upon the reader, but the effort is rewarding if the whole be accepted as the promise of a talent not fully developed. Grossman $6.95 The Original, by Larry Smith. Pitted even as a small boy against the relentless forces of nature in an effort to survive the rigors of life, first in a north Michigan lumber camp, then on an outly ing farm, Mr. Smith's hero manages to en dure an incredible series of hardships until he is finally felled by absolute exhaustion, not very much to the astonishment of the reader who has meanwhile marveled at this account of heavy physical labor against al most insurmountable odds. At times grim almost beyond belief, the story is told with admirable freshness and liveliness. McGraw-Hill $7.95 The Dream Team, by Joe McGinniss. In an amusing, frankly ephemeral first novel the author writes about two men and a girl with some candor, but to far greater effectiveness about horse racing, a fanciful system for beating the ponies, and the lure of a sport irresistible in its promise of infinite riches. Not many converts are apt to be made among those not already addicted to betting at one or another track; on the other hand few accounts could offer greater rewards as pure entertainment. Random $5.95 Prize Stories 1912: The O. Henry Awards, edited by William Abrahams. As the editor states in his introduction, stories in such a collection are not chosen because they exemplify any predetermined theme, but since they are written during the same time span, more often than not some theme common to most of them does emerge. In this collection, it would seem to be the concern of the individual with his personal problems rather than with such public issues as war, racial conflict, ecology, and so forth. Certainly in the three prize winning stories, John Batki's "Strange Dreaming Charlie, Cow-Eyed Charlie," Joyce Carol Oates's "Saul Bird Says: Re late! Communicate! Liberate!," and Judith Rascoe's, "Small Sounds and Tilting Shadows," the protagonists are primarily seeking to achieve some direction and se curity in their own lives rather than to im prove the human condition in general. Three other stories concerned obliquely with the same theme are distinguished for their careful workmanship: Brendan Gill's "Fat Girl," a tragi-comic study of a fa miliar psychopathic type, and Anne Tyler's "With All Flags Flying" and Patricia Zel ver's "On the Desert," two narratives memorable for superb characterization, in which two different individuals solve the problem of maintaining their dignity and integrity in different ways. If one wishes to be familiar with the short fiction of our time, "Prize Stories 1972" provides a repre sentative collection. Doubleday $6.95 The Complete Stories, by Flannery O'Con nor. To read Flannery O'Connor is to know, often more than one may comfortably know, about the violent operation of grace in human lives. It would be enough to have all of the familiar stories in one volume, but here they are enriched by the addition of twelve stories previously unpublished in book form.

Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux $10 Tales of Moonlight and Rain: Japanese Gothic Tales, by Uyeda Akinari. In a way, it is rather unfortunate that the translator has inserted the adjective, gothic, in the descriptive subtitle of this translation of Ugetsu Monogatari, even though the date of its original publication (1776) is fairly close to that of "The Castle of Otranto" (1765). But no causal influence from the West exists here, and these nine tales are distinctly Japanese in thought, structure, and feeling. True, they partake of the weird and eery, but they are suffused with a deep classical beauty which has insured their popularity over the years. Columbia #7.50 POETRY The Clerk's Journal, by Conrad Aiken. This is the first printing of Aiken's first successful poem. The experience of writing it and the favorable reaction of his teacher, Dean Briggs, confirmed his desire to pursue a career in letters. The work describes the brief and unsuccessful attempt by an office clerk to win the heart of a waitress and it holds up, after the years, surprisingly well. Included also is a facsimile of the manuscript and a charming "Memoir" which recalls the author's student days at Harvard and his early friendship with T. S. Eliot. Of value and interest to those who care about Aiken and the origins of modern American poetry. Eakins $8.50 The Swimmers and Other Selected Poems, by Allen Tate. Tate's poems earned our gratitude years ago. They no longer require our praise. His work, in one form or another, is on the shelf of everyone interested in American poetry and letters. A broad collection of the verse has been needed because earlier volumes have dropped out of print. We should welcome, then, this new "definitive" selection by the author of ninety-nine of his best poems, including "Ode to the Con federate Dead," "Seasons of the Soul," and "The Swimmers." The poems themselves and the convenience of the collection are splendid but the book itself is a sorry affair. Has any poet of this stature ever been so shabbily treated by his publisher? The paper is cheap and heavily starched, al ready threatening to yellow. The print ing is so uneven that many of the pages are barely legible. The cover cloth is of the lowest quality and there are no headbands. The folding is so bad and the pages trimmed so narrowly that many of the poems sur vive on the page by the grace of less than a half inch of margin. All in all, an ironic tribute to a poet whose hallmark is a scru pulous sense of craftsmanship. Scribner's $5.95 Twenty Poems, by John Haines. This handsome but very slim little book contains work which very often has the feeling of something prepared for but left out of the poet's two earlier collections, "Winter News" and "The Stone Harp." If there is little here which will add to Haines's reputation there is surprisingly little which will diminish it. Haines con tinues to maintain an unusually high level of invention, excitement, and intelligence even in his minor poems. "The Frost King," for example, which is slight but almost per fectly wrought, clearly conveys Haines's extraordinary relation to nature, that par ticular excellence which distinguishes his finest work. Unicorn $6.95 Japanese Poetry Now, remade into Eng lish by Thomas Fitzsimmons. Accurately titled, this small volume of "remade" poems gives a very fair idea of the way in which Japan has repudiated the linguistic heritage represented by the tanka and the haiku. Now it is the poetic theme that dominates, frequently amid a spatter-work of syllables. Much of it is simply derivative; some of it is impressive. Since these are not, in the proper sense, "translations," one cannot complain that the writer has failed to include the original Japanese versions, though one often wonders. . . .

Hubbell. The method is maddening. First, a plod ding summary, one by one, of the polls, surveys, competitions, and literary histories over the years that rank the great Ameri can authors or try to fix some of them in the semi-permanent formaldehyde of fame. Second, a remorseless finger-pointing when each of the judgments is found wanting— poor Parrington slighting Poe and James, the Pulitzer committee unmoved by "The Sound and the Fury." Third, a leaden weight of commonplaces that repeatedly threatens the very plodding with utter in ertia ("every new literary history is al ready a little outmoded by the time it is published"). But given these procedures, the study still remains not only necessary but curiously pleasing, a satisfying overview that probably only an elder statesman with wide sympathies and no axe to grind could have produced. The vagaries of our lit erary values can only be realized in some catalogue such as this, and a careful reader will likely find himself in the future reining the impulse to judge as if from Sinai or the Vatican.

Each new volume of this series seems the best so far published. This may be be cause these notebooks accurately reflect the moral and intellectual and even the literary development of a great American, perhaps the greatest in the field of literature. The editing is uniformly excellent, and as one becomes accustomed to the technique used, it becomes less obtrusive. Reformers were rife during these years: Millerites awaiting the approaching end of the world, aboli tionists worrying the consciences of many New Englanders, anti-war agitators during the Mexican War, associationists at Brook Farm, Emerson's friend and neighbor Al cott and other incompetent idealists at Fruitlands, Thoreau philosophizing at Wal dii</page><page sequence="14">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS den or going to jail in Concord because he did not like some of the things his taxes were spent for. So far Emerson had kept clear of reformist entanglements, had looked at them all objectively and gone his own way, but the pressures on him were mounting. These were rich years for Emer son. In these journals we can read the first drafts of the great essays "Experience" and "The Poet," and of the five essays, scarcely less great, to be published in "Representa tive Men" in 1850. He was reading widely, especially in the religious and philosophical writings of the ancient Hindus, and setting down great thoughts of his own. It is a pity that these journals are destined to be used chiefly as reference books, for they make delightful reading. Perhaps one day some thoughtful person will make a selec tion for popular distribution. For scholars they are a storehouse of inestimable trea sures. Harvard $17 Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe, by Daniel Hoffman. This breezy admixture of Daniel Hoff man and Edgar Poe gabbily dishes up Poe as Poe might have liked most, as the poet, inventor, explorer, and esthete rather than the driven, diseased demi-artist or the com plex adolescent, and like its subject, it oc casionally hits the mark and occasionally falls embarrassingly short of it. The head long rush to great words, the outside chance, the confesssion, all recapitulate Poe as much as they communicate Hoffman, and indeed the combination may be one of the most communicative studies of Poe yet. Doubleday Norman Mailer: The Man and His Work, by Robert F. Lucid. The worst essay in this anthology shows us what Mailer was up against in his own generation. In smug, manly tones, Calder Willingham informs us that the true writer must renounce ambition, ideology, literary criticism, and an interest in style, in order to gain, with Tolstoy, Moral Truth. Mail er's defiance of all these shibboleths partly accounts for his late, but richly deserved, renown; whether it has also given him greatness, or a severe fragmentation of identity, or both, is a harder question. This civ book contains several honest and subtle at tempts at ultimate evaluation—the very best is Diana Trilling's. The more specific pieces are also helpful, but the selection seems overinfluenced by fugitive controversies: why else would "An American Dream" get four times as many essays as any other novel? Little, Br own $6.95 Descent and Return: The Orphic Theme in Modern Literature, by Walter A. Strauss. Of all the books and articles which have appeared these past ten years on the pres ence and function of myth in modern European literature, this recent study is easily the most thought-provoking and most satisfying. Mr. Strauss traces the meta morphosis of Orpheus from Novalis and Nerval through Mallarmé and Rilke to our own day in language that is refreshingly free of jargon and obscure terminology. In penetrating analyses of representative works from major writers, the author focuses on the modern period's use of the descent into Hades motif as an archetype of man's pre occupation with self-knowledge, the uncon scious, death, and nothingness. The book is further enhanced by expert translations from the French and German excerpts quoted, which place this important work at the disposal of the general reader as well as the scholar. Harvard $10 Fact and Symbol: Essays in the Sociology of Art and Literature, by César Grana. The publication of the seven essays in this book must remain a curious puzzle. Tied together only by the title, they range from a discussion of "Social Optimism and Literary Depression" to "The Private Lives of Public Museums: Can Art Be Democratic?" and "Cultural Dreams and Historical Frustrations in Spanish American Literature." Although the essays are cul tural studies of problems in literature and art, they seem, with only few exceptions, to be written at a considerable distance from any immediate experience of literary works. The cultural generalizations are too broad or too obvious to be of much service to students either of sociology or of the arts. And, occasionally, there is a rather startling remark illustrating the author's</page><page sequence="15">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS idea of contemporary literary history, as when he writes, "Some of the newer Black writers, like Eldridge Cleaver... Oxford $1.50 A Stage for Poets: Studies in the Theatre of Hugo and Musset, by Charles Affron. This is an important work on the French Romantic drama. An examination of ten plays from Hugo and Musset answers the question posed in an introductory chap ter: "Can the dialectic form of the theatre accommodate the solitary élan of the lyric poet?" In his illuminating explica tions of such plays as "Hernani," "Les Bur graves," "Fantasio," and "Lorenzaccio," Professor Affron discusses such topics as poetic time, the nature and scope of anal ogy, theatrical and poetic rhetoric, the stances of the poet-hero, and the projection of the poet's voice and viewpoint on the stage. Romantic theatre is a hybrid between poetry and drama, and this study examines in very convincing manner those elements and motifs which account for its originality, its strengths and weaknesses. This is a pene trating study which sheds new light not only on the French Romantic theatre but upon the whole concept of Romanticism. Every student of French literature will wish to acquire it. Princeton $9.50 The Guest-Hall of Eden. Four Essays on the Design of Old English Poetry, by Alvin A. Lee. After about fifteen years of occasionally exciting but ultimately fruitless debate about formulaic diction and oral composi tion, it is encouraging to find students of Old English poetry returning to the poems as works of literary art. Professor Lee's essays are an intelligent attempt to define the mythology (Christian and biblical) in relation to the poetic language (Germanic and heroic) of the slender corpus of sur viving verse. Rejecting the naïve dichotomy between Christian didactic and Germanic heroic which has bedeviled so much criti cism of this poetry, he posits instead a unity of myth and language which provides shape and meaning to poems within the tradition. The two drihts and their guest halls, like the two cities of St. Augustine's "De civitate dei," provide a metaphor around which other important recurring themes and images—ruined buildings, wan dering thanes, treasure hordes, wildernesses, and bright plains—find explanation. Yale $8.50 GENERAL Beyond the Stable State, by Donald A. Schon. Donald Schon argues in this scholarly analysis that the stable state belongs to the past, and that men must abandon their nostalgia for its security and turn to the development of institutional structures, an epistemology and an ethic of change that correspond to the realities of change. His knowledge of philosophy and of business systems promises a strongly creative ten sion between the modes of reflection and of action, but this expectation, unfortu nately, is not fulfilled. Perhaps because the book is written for a general audience, the philosophical pole has been submerged, and only the basic concepts of systems analysis have been marshaled. Even with the limited tools he chooses to use, how ever, Schon's reasons for the stagnation of many contemporary institutions, including government, are convincing, as is his thesis that our institutions must become learning systems. His examples are interesting, and are carefully selected from a wide and of ten surprising range of material. Both the style and organization of this book exhibit a remarkable clarity and order that is bought at the expense of the complexity of the ideas presented, but as a result the book is an excellent choice for the general reader. Serious scholars will find the chap ter on social change the most interesting in its critique of the rational experimental mode of knowing, and its comparison of the epistemological basis of systems anal ysis and existentialism. Schon's views in this chapter are useful as a complement to a similar criticism in Radnitzky's "Conti nental Schools of Metascience," a work that is as obviously directed at a scholarly audience as Schon's is at the general public. Random $7.95 The Coming of Age of American Business, by Elisha P. Douglass. Under the heading of business history, CV</page><page sequence="16">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS this book brings together an account of the development of leading American business enterprises. It covers the period from the settlement of the colonies to the beginning of the twentieth century. The work is not so much an integrated account as it is a series of extended essays in the fields of financial, industrial, and commercial enter prises. Throughout these essays, however, the focus is kept on the institutional de velopment of business, the continuing spe cialization of American business operations. This book is based entirely on secondary sources. In this respect the work is at times disappointing because of its failure to go beyond this synthesis. Furthermore, some of the essays are weak or incomplete because of the absence of monographic studies of those particular areas. These criticisms are not meant to suggest that this is a poor book; quite the reverse is true. Douglass has done an excellent job of summarizing the existing works in this relatively new field of American history. The critical bibliog raphy in the back of this volume should be especially helpful. North Carolina $15 The Intellectual Origins of the Trench En lightenment, by Ira O. Wade. In this impressive volume, Professor Wade explains the major stances of the French Enlightenment by examining the writings of its forerunners as far back as the Renaissance in such men as Montaigne, Bodin, and Bacon. The treatment is nothing short of comprehensive, and the analyses of the contributions of such varied think ers as Descartes, Hobbes, Pascal, Locke, Spinoza, Malebranche, Gassendi, and Leib niz, among others, are presented in language that will appeal as much to the uninitiated student as to the seasoned scholar. Mr. Wade's study gives rich evidence of the continuity and consistency of man's rea soned response to the spirit of the Middle Ages from the Renaissance to the Age of Reason. The mind of the humanist is ap parent on every page of this magnificent book, which must be hailed as an indispen sable complement to the works of such "philosophes" as Montesquieu, Diderot, and Voltaire. One only regrets the absence of an analytical index which would have proved helpful for reference. Princeton $20 Wandering, by Hermann Hesse. Translated by James Wright. In 1920, the year after "Demian," Hesse published "Wandering," a balanced collec tion of sketches, short poems, and water colors which, though not popular, expressed Hesse's immature lyricism cogently, dream ily, yet succinctly. This new translation, featuring monotone facsimiles of the origi nal watercolors, succeeds in presenting a more accessible Hesse, a comfortable artist still at ease in a personal world of farms, mountains, meadows, and chapels. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux $4.95 Fifty Years of Russian Prose, edited by Krystyna Pomorska. This two-volume anthology brings to gether some of the finest examples of prose published in Russia under the Soviet regime. In all, there are twenty-six selections from twenty different authors. The selections vary in length from five to over a hundred pages; all, however, are polished works which have been skillfully translated. Some will be familiar to all students of bel les-lettres—e.g., selections by Boris Paster nak and Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Those less familiar with modern Russian prose will be delighted to find stories by Isaac Babel, Alexander Grin, Bulat Okudzhava, and a number of other major figures who are still relatively unknown in the West. Two sets of introductory essays and biographical notes by Pomorska, while unfortunately brief, help to acquaint the reader with the authors and their works. MIT $10 each volume Searching for Ikons in Russia, by Vladimir Soloukhin. One must say at once that this is a very good-humored book based on the author's own experiences. But it is so amiable, in deed almost pastoral, that one is constantly surprised at finding such a quality in pres ent-day Russian life. How pleasant it is, then, to discover a non-political activity carried out with skill and passion. As for icons, their beauty, their history, and their iconography are worth any effort needed to search them out. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich $6.95 cvi</page><page sequence="17">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS American Painting to 1776: A Reappraisal, edited by Ian M. G. Quimby. A report of the Winterthur Conference for 1971, "American Painting to 1776" at tempts a fresh look at our early painters, a fresh look influenced by contemporary methods of art history. Of the papers in cluded, those in the section on technical aids to identification are perhaps the most interesting. They at least provide a physical basis for judgment beyond the merely visual, though, alas, as one of the men in volved said, such aids become enormously expensive. They do, however, carry our knowledge forward for a corpus of painting which is just beginning to submit itself to scholarly disciplines. Virginia $4.50 See for Yourself, by Wilmarth Sheldon Lewis. It is easy to see that these essays on ten favorite pictures in ten different museums are the work of a literary man. They are the result of long periods of thinking and many revisions after the advice of friends to whom they have been read. And so their style is impeccable, polished, charm ing, and flowing. Here the literary man is supreme, especially when he is talking about the subject of each painting. When the author talks about the painting itself it is plain to see that his mind is not a visual one, for those values are skimped if not actually not comprehended. But since there are infinite ways to see for oneself, the literary way is certainly one which must be accepted. Harper &amp; Row $1j Painterly Painting, edited by Thomas B. Hess and John Ashbery. The 37th Art News Annual, devoted to painterly painting, is full of pleasure and surprise. The pleasure comes from the five articles about painting from Rome through Constable with the most interesting being, perhaps, the one on "Roman Illusionism" by Sheldon Nodelman. The surprise lies in the pieces on contemporary painting, for the choices do not fit one's preconceived ideas of painterly painters. Though one does not always agree with the authors, this stretching of the mind is admirable. Macmillan $12 Ghibertfs Bronze Doors, by Richard Krautheimer. In 1956 Krautheimer published his land mark study of Lorenzo Ghiberti. The pres ent volume gathers all the fine illustrations from that study that pertain to the north and east doors of the Baptistery at Florence and adds to them a brief commentary and helpful diagrams. Every panel is illustrated —many with additional details—and there are photographs of the border decorations, Prophets, and Prophetesses. Four accurate color plates round out the book. Krauthei mer's commentary succinctly describes the meaning and style of the doors and gives pertinent biographical information. As an introduction to Ghiberti or as a handy guide to the doors it would be hard to imagine a better book than this one—partic ularly at the price. Princeton #7.50 Art and Experience in Classical Greece, by J. J. Pollitt. Experience—intellectual, political, socio logical experience—as it affects art is the real subject of this new study of classical Greece. And how salutary it is to have these things set out in a forthright way, as background for the changes that took place during the fifth and first half of the fourth centuries, B. C. Although the increasing knowledge which helped the craftsmen and artists to produce increasingly flowing and able works of art is largely ignored, many valid insights are gained from Mr. Pollitt's text. Cambridge $ 10.95 Death, Heaven and the Victorians, by John Morley. In a very handsome quarto volume, crammed with color and black-and-white photographs, Mr. Morley examines the funeral habits of the Victorians. The author obviously enjoyed his task, yet one is never certain whether his pleasure is satirical or sympathetic, for he does seem to have a lack of understanding of the ever-present threat of illness and death so striking in any Victorian correspondence. Whatever his at titude, the material he has unearthed is as tonishing and enriches our knowledge of these rather grim practices of the nineteenth century. Pittsburgh $12.95 cviii</page><page sequence="18">NOTES ON CURRENT BOOKS The Classical Style: Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, by Charles Rosen. The author, an eminent musicologist and pianist, discusses the stylistic variety of music of the late eighteenth and early nine teenth centuries first in terms of the origins and coherence of the musical language and then with respect to the development of different genres in the works or these three masters. His coverage is both comprehen sive and detailed, supported with many musical illustrations. Neither a survey nor a history, this is an enlightened discourse, informative, stimulating, and entertaining, one of the few substantive works in the field. Viking $12.50 Shots: Photographs from the Underground Press, edited by David Fenton. Alternately emotional, classic, or grimly political, one hundred black-and-white photographs from the collections of the various counter-culture presses can deliver quite a deathblow to the flower-child image of "liberation" sun-kissed 1960's-style. They can also convey, with repeated shots of bleeding kids flashing the vee sign, or of soldiers rigidly confronting rebellious stu dents, a real sense of the deadly struggle the underground sees itself involved in, and of the tedium. All this is not to praise: one can miss the fine lines distinguishing gravity from tedium, or political expression from rhetoric, and unfortunately joylessness hangs on this book like a rock, and the collage of black-and-white emerges pre dominantly black. Doutas $2.95 On Ice and Snow and Rock, by Gaston Rebuffat. "On Ice and Snow and Rock" is a book for those who are happier wedging than watching the tube, who feel more at home on a glacier than on a city sidewalk, and who would rather strap on crampons than a neck tie. Rebuffat, already a legend among mountain climbers, is also a gifted writer who can translate the joys of scaling tall peaks into terms that have meaning to those who prefer to keep on the level. Un like his earlier books, which are impres sionistic alpine hymns, this is a book de voted to equipment and technique. But it is not merely a manual. It is a book that will appeal to all who have seen a hawk and wanted to fly or have stood on a high place and seen the miniature valley below. This is an important book that will be classic in the literature of mountains and mountain climb ing. Oxford $15 The Treasure Galleons, by Dave Horner. Mr. Horner, himself a diving authority, has done a very thorough and impressive book about the treasure galleons. His tech nical knowledge is astounding, for he not only traces the routes used by the ships which took the gold and silver to Spain, but he also knows a great deal about the ships themselves. As for hazards, one wonders that any of them got through, not that some of them sank. Of the sunken vessels he traces quite a few, giving details of their contents and their probable points of wrecking. Not only a guide but a well written volume. Dodd, Mead $10 Ulysses Airborne, by Mauricio Obregön. Ulysses, of course, was not airborne, but the author followed his travels by air. Al though the resultant volume does not nec essarily add to the field of Homeric studies, it does provide an erudite travel book, which is perhaps rather more worth while. Instant communications have told us so much about our world that only travels with a purpose, such as this, seem worth re porting anymore.
