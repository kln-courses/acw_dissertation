<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE OMPHALOS MYTH AND HEBREW RELIGION BY SAMUEL TERRIEN New York It has long been recognized that the omphalos myth played an important part in the cults of ancient Greece. The pioneering work of Jane HARRISON, at the end of the XIXth century 1), was followed by numerous monographs, especially those of W. H. ROSCHER, R. MERINGER, A. B. COOK, E. ROHDE, Ch. PICARD, F. ROBERT, Marie DELCOURT, and H. -V. HERRMANN 2). Studies of the Greek forms of the myth have alerted the attention of Orientalists, like A. J. WENSINCK and E. BURROWS 3), to the importance of this belief for the understanding of Semitic as well as Hellenic religions. Historians of comparative religions and cultures, like G. DUMEZIL, Mircea ELIADE 1) J.

MiLLER 1), have described manifestations of similar beliefs that are widespread among numerous ethnic groups. At the same time, biblical scholars have pointed out that the Canaanite myth of the earth-navel appears also in the literature of the ancient Hebrews. W. CASPARI and H. W. HERTZBERG, for example, have discussed the possibility that Mount Tabor was considered at one time to be the center of the land, and perhaps of the earth 2), but W. F. ALBRIGHT has shown that the relation between the name ,,Tabor" and the word tabbur is unlikely 3). On the contrary, W. HARRELSON, B. W. ANDER- SON, G. E. WRIGHT, and E. NIELSEN, among others 4), have reminded us, on the basis of Judg. ix 37, of the significance of the myth in the XIth cent. B. C. for the inhabitants of Shechem. Brevard CHILDS has analyzed the growth of the same mythical motif in connection with the temple of Solomon and the later speculations on the new Jerusalem 5).

More probably, the term alludes to the cosmic significance which was attached to a mountain, possibly Mt. Gerizim (HERTZBERG). 5) B. S.

In all probability, the myth of the navel of the earth, far from being an incidental aspect of worship at the temple of Jerusalem, constitutes in effect the determining factor which links together a number of its cultic practices and beliefs that otherwise appear to be unrelated. Following the work of W. H. ROSCHER, A. J. WENSINCK, H. GRESSMANN, K. L. SCHMIDT, A. LAUHA, O. EISSFELDT, and others 2), Brevard CHILDS has shown that, according to the biblical traditions, the sacred space of the Jerusalem temple is set apart from all other spaces of the earth, not only because Yahweh has chosen Zion as his menuhah, his "resting place" 3), but also because the Judahites have adopted from the Canaanites of ancient Jebus the belief that the site of Zion was related to the navel of the earth. Solomon's temple is built on a rock 4) which is the earth-center, the world mountain, the foundation stone of creation, the extremity of the umbilical cord which provides a link between heaven, earth, and the underworld 5). 1) R.

TERRIEN It therefore becomes associated with the cosmic tree, 1) the garden cord as a mythopoetic expression, both temporal and spatial, of the spot where the foundation of the earth began (cf. HARRISON, ROSCHER, WENSINCK, et al.), it is significant to observe that the verb qanah means ,,to own", ,,to possess", as well as ,,to create" in the sense of ,,procreate", especially in the expression qoneh shamayim wa'ares, ,,maker of heaven and earth" (Gen. xiv 19, 21; cf. P. HUMBERT, "Qdnd en hebreu biblique", Festschriftfiur A. Bertholet, 1950, p. 259 ff.; reprinted in Opuscules d'un bebraisant, Neuchatel 1958, pp. 166 if.; see especially pp. 173 f.). The presence of such an expression in a tradition which has been associated to Jerusalem is probably more than coincidental if the omphalos myth existed in Canaanite Jebus long before the Davidic conquest. As it is well known, the Jerusalem priesthood inherited traditions and practices from the pre-Davidic shrine. See H. S. NYBERG, "Studien zum Religionskampf im Alten Testament. I. Der Gott Al: Belege und Bedeutung des Namens", ARW. XXV, 1938, pp. 351, 363 f.; G. VON RAD, Genesis, 1949; tr. by J. H. MARKS, Philadelphia 1961, p. 174 ff.; H.

JOHNSON, Sacral Kingship in Ancient Israel, Cardiff 1955, pp. 42 if. The omphalos myth appears in the background of "the Chedorlaomer texts" where "Babylon, the bond of heaven [and earth], which is founded toward the four winds", receives its punishment from Marduk; M. C. ASTOUR, "Political and Cosmic Symbolism in Genesis 14 and its Babylonian Sources", A. ALTMANN, ed., Biblical Motifs, Cambridge, Mass., 1966, pp. 65 ff. While the midrash of Gen. xiv is late (sixth cent. B. C.), the poetic blessing of Melchisedek (Gen. xiv 18-20) may rest on an ancient oral tradition. Cf. S. LANDERSDORFER, "Das Priesterk6nig- tum von Salem",JSOR. IX, 1925, pp. 203-16; W. F. ALBRIGHT, "The Historical Background of Genesis XIV", JSOR.

KROEZE, Genesis Veertien, Hilversum 1937, pp. 133 f.; R. RENDTORFF, "El Ba'al und Jahwe", ZA W. LXXVIII, 1966, p. 279. In its aspect of umbilical cord between "heaven and earth", the omphalos myth may also explain the use of these words as divine epithets in a seventh- century B.C. Aramaic papyrus (A. DUPONT-SOMMER, "Un papyrus arameen d'epoque saite... ," Semitica I, 1948, pp. 44, 47; H. L. GINSBERG, ,,An Aramaic Contemporary of the Lachish Letters", BASOR III, Oct. 1948, p. 24 ff. and several Akkadian documents (K.

The late tradition and the modern conjecture which relate Salem not to Jebus but to Shechem (R. H. SMITH, "Abram and Melchizedek", ZAW. LXXVII, 1965, pp. 129 ff., especially pp. 149 ff.) is significant, since both sites are related to the omphalos myth. 1) A.

Even if the etymological connection betweenyasiac, "gallery" andyasuac, "couch, bed", is open to debate, the semantic association between the two words could hardly escape the attention of the popular mind (Gen. xlix 4; Job v 1; etc.).

In the first place, although we have no explicit information to the effect that the Bronze Serpent, Nehushtan, which Hezekiah destroyed (II Kings xviii 4), was already in Jerusalem when David's men captured the Canaanite stronghold, we have the right to assume, after the argumentation of H.

Rather, one may entertain the possibility of their distinct, separated and common ancestry in the Phoenician cultus of the Second Millenium B.C. Some of the parallels observed by C. H. GORDON between Ugarit and the Aegean world may not be lightly dismissed. See C. H. GORDON, Before the Bible, The Common Background of Greek and Hebrew Civiligation, New York 1962, pp. 128 if. The conjecture of a Scythian origin for practises and beliefs which appear at Jerusalem, Delphi, and Tara in Ireland, remains outside the limits of this inquiry. Cf. G. W.

Representations of serpents appear together with those of the goddess Ashera at Ugarit, at Bethshan, possibly at Beit Mirsim, at Hazor, and at many other places of Syria and Palestine 2). The seraphim of Isaiah's inaugural vision in the Jerusalem temple were probably "winged serpents" 3), which may reflect Egyptian rather than Canaanite mythology, as Karen Joines has recently suggested 4). Even if this is the case, however, the Egyptian cobra or uraeus is related to the underworld, and when it is endowed with hands, or feet as the Isaianic saraph appears to be (vi 6), it also bears a human face with feminine features which point to its connection not with a god but with a goddess 5). The representations of the omphalos at Delphi and elsewhere, which appear to have been associated from the earliest times with Gaea, the Magna Mater in her chthonian aspect, always include images sonnel.

The Earth Goddess of the Eastern Mediterranean cultures is a Snake Deity, from the early Creto-Minoan times, down to the Ophite sects in pre-Christian and Christian gnosticism 2). It is therefore likely that the presence of Nehushtan in the Jerusalem temple indicates that the omphalos myth was alive among the Jebusites before the Davidic and Solomonic era. 2. In the second place, the meaning of the word debir, used in the early sources of Kings to designate the innermost room of Solomon's temple (I Kgs. vi 5), probably derives from an Egyptian word for "back room," which is also found in Arabic, rather than from the West-Semitic root d.b.r., "to speak, to act," a traditional derivation from which arose the rendering ,,oracle" 3). Hence, it is not possible to affirm that the most sacred spot in Solomon's temple was specifically designed for chthonian divination. Nevertheless, if one admits with H. SCHMIDT and R. de VAUX 4) that this innermost room, rather than the outside altar, rested on the original sacred rock, we are able to discern how this dark place could be directly related to the belief of ,,the foundation stone," which already in the time of Isaiah connoted the idea of the underworld 5), and indeed came to symbolize the 1) J.

The Sea of Bronze, outside the edifice, was considerable in its size and weight, as well as extremely complex and expensive in its manufac- turing and installation 2). We have therefore the right to assume that Solomon shared with his Canaanite architects and technicians a belief in the urgency of its cultic function. The cosmic significance of the Sea of Bronze and especially its mythical association with the tehom are now generally recognized 3). Similar considerations apply prob- ably to the great altar 4). Now, one of the chief characteristics of the omphalos myth is precisely that it points not only to the sacred space which unites earth to heaven, but also and especially that it recalls hieratically the RHODOKANAKIS, "Omphalos und Ewen Sepiia", Wiorter und Sachen V, 1913, p. 198 ff.; E.

In all probability, the manufacture, transportation, in- stallation, and cost of a cultic object of such dimensions pointed to more than a utilitarian usage. Its very name, Hayyam, "the Sea", could not fail to elicit in the mind of those who heard or pronounced the word an association with the myth of the cosmic waters. See A.

The motif of the 'araphel, "thickdark- ness" as well as "storm cloud" (cf. Ugaritic crp, Akkadian arpu, and Arabic 'arapha; Hebrew caraph, "to drip, to drop") attempts clearly to relate the Canaanite myth of fertility (ALBRIGHT, Yahweh and the Gods of Canaan, p. 231) to the Yahwist- ic tradition of the Sinai theophany (Exod. xx 18; cf.

Now, the worship of the sun is not as widespread as sometimes believed, but it is always related to both the cult of the Terra Mater and the ritual manipulation of chthonian forces 2). At Delphi, the cult of Gaea, the Earth Mother, which appears to have been associated from the earliest times to the veneration of the navel stone, was transformed in the course of the centuries into the worship of the solar deity, Phoebos. The great Olympian son, Apollo, is often represented not only as riding with his fiery chariot and his elegant equine retinue, but also seated or standing on the omphalos, while holding laurel branch and a lyre 3). The link between omphalos and sun appears also in many places of the Greek literature, from Euripides to Plutarch 4). Moreover, the Delphic omphalos received another meaning as it came to be regarded also as the tomb of the dismembered Dionysos, the "son of Semele". Like Apollo, Dionysos appears on the omphalos, holding his thyrsos in his right hand 5). The solar cycle of seasons evolves around the ancient myth of the center of the earth. We have therefore a legitimate basis for conjecturing that the solar cult, which went on in Jerusalem apparently from the time of the erection of the temple, was associated, like the ophidian worship and the ritual concern for the primeval abyss, the chthonian forces and the garden of Eden, to the myth of the omphalos and the adoration of the Terra Mater. See also the possibility of the solar character of the two pillars (ALBRIGHT, Archaeology and the Religion of Israel, pp. 148, 216, note 62; H. G.

In the fourth place, the presence of male prostitutes, the qedheshim, among the cultic officials of the Jerusalem temple has never been satisfactorily explained, if indeed it is mentioned at all 1). The nor- thern kingdom of Israel had apparently its female prostitutes, whether these were cultic or secular, depending on the exact meaning of the words qedheshah and Zonah in the course of the ages 2), but only the qedheshim are mentioned in connection with the cultic personnel of the kingdom of Judah 3). The reference to both male and female pro- stitutes which is found in the Deuteronomic code (xxiii 18) tends merely to confirm the validity of the generally accepted thesis of the northern provenance of such a legislation. As Joh. PEDERSEN, R. DUSSAUD, W. F. ALBRIGHT, G. W. AHLSTR6M, A.

The ceremonial of the temple must have been initiated, or at least endorsed and maintained by the near unanimity of the Davidic monarchs for more than three hundred years. If Asa, perhaps Hezekiah, and Josiah, in three widely separated periods of time, succeeded in expelling the qedheshim from the Jerusalem sanctuary1), their re- spective successors, probably in each case their own sons, hastened to return to the cultic status quo. We may affirm that normative cere- monial, in the temple of Solomon, ascribed to the male prostitutes a prominent place in the ritual. We have to admit, however, that the theology of male prostitution is far from clear. At Ugarit, in about 1400 B.

TERRIEN age - the gallus and the cinaedus of Asia Minor and Phoenicia, it may be affirmed that the ritual of male prostitution was one of the most characteristic manifestations of devotion to the Magna Mater, the Earth Mother 1). It is perhaps worth noting that modern psychoana- lytical research tends to confirm that male homosexuality appears to be related either to maternal fixation or to the castration fear-and- fascination complex. Conceivably, the function of the male prostitutes in the Jerusalem temple as well as in the other shrines of the Ancient Near East was related to an ecstatic form of divination technique 2). One may even go a step farther and suggest that the cherubim, whose precise identification and symbolism have eluded the searching in- quiries of such scholars as P. DHORME, W. F. ALBRIGHT, M. HARAN, and R. de VAUX 3), may have been sculpted representations of the- 1968, pp. 111 f.; W. L. MORAN, "New Evidence from Mari on the History of Prophecy," Biblica L, 1969, p. 30 and note 2. The assinnu may well have obtained his oracular function through sophisticated techniques of sexual trance. 1) The association of male prostitution with sun worship on the one hand and with devotion to the Terra Mater on the other may be related to the bisexuality of the sun among the various Semitic religions. The female aspect of the solar deity is attested at Ugarit as well as in South Arabia. See A. CAQUOT, "La divinite solaire ougaritique," Syria XXXVI, 1959, p. 90, note 1. 2) The correspondence of the Hebrew word Qedheshim in Jerusalem and of the Greek word Hosioi at Delphi may be more than coincidental. It is probable that the Galloi practiced the art of divination through physio-psychological trance, which in turn was related to telluric rites. See H. GRAILLOT, Le culte de Cybele, pp. 307 ff.; Ch. PICARD, Ephese and Claros, pp. 226, 233 f., 555, note 5. While the character and function of the Galloi remain mysterious, those of the Hosioi are clearly associated with oracular procedure.

There is no compelling evidence to the effect that the cherubim should be viewed as sphinxes endowed with wings.

They alternated with palm-trees and open flower- calyxes (1 Kgs. vii 29, 31-35; cf. Ezek. xli 18 ff.), symbols which suggested, as much as the bronze pomegranates (1 Kgs. vii 18), the fertility of the Terra Mater. The relation of the temple cherubim to those of the garden of Eden (Gen. iii 24) and to the storm-clouds (2 Sam. xxii 11; Ps. viii 11) points to the same aspect of the Canaanite myth and ritual. 3) The representations of the Delphic omphalos often included figures of winged humans, youths or boys, flying above a recoiling serpent.

TERRIEN rabbinical literature has preserved traditions which link the cherubim with the fertility of the earth, and one strange text in the Babylonian Talmud (Yoma 54a-b) reads: "Resh Laqish said, When the heathens entered the Temple and saw the cherubim whose bodies were inter- twined with one another, they carried them out and said: These Israelites, whose blessing is a blessing and whose curse is a curse, occupy themselves with such things. And immediately they despised them . . " 1) At any rate, we shall observe that the mention of the qedheshim is restricted to the kingdom of Judah, and may well have been related to the ceremonial of Maacah's cultic object, the mysterious miphleseth (1 Kings xv 13), which JEROME rendered as simulacrum Priapi2). A similar ritual, perhaps performed for the sake of a similar object, may have been meant by Ezekiel when he attacked the practices which were still performed in the temple at the beginning of the sixth century B. C. (Ezek. viii 7-13; cf. xvi 17). In the light of the foregoing discussion, it will not be surprising to note that Ezekiel is associating such ceremonials with ophidian worship (vs. 10) and the rites of the solar cult (vss. 16-18). In all probablitity, the office of the Gebhirah, or "Queen Mother," which appeared to be peculiar to the kingdom of Judah, had a cultic function which is no longer clear from the present documents.

The worship of Ashera at the court of Judah 2), by most of the Davidic kings and queens, thus brings together in remarkable fashion a number of cultic elements which are superficially heterogeneous but may appear to revolve, in the Ancient Near East, in Asia Minor, and in Greece at a later age, as revolving around the myth of the omphalos - chthonian forces, sacred snake, solar ritual, male prostitution, bisexuality. By using due caution, and cognizant of the paucity of the available information, are we not permitted to conjecture that the construction of the Solomonic temple introduced at the heart of Yahwism the pre- Davidic belief in the myth of the omphalos, and that this myth, in turn, was deemed to be useful, with all the ritual it entailed, as a support for the concept of hereditary monarchy ?

TERRIEN II The myth of the omphalos in Jerusalem passed through several interpretations as it was gradually adapted to the religion of Yahweh, and - vice versa - its incorporation within Yahwism profoundly influenced and altered Judah's faith. Religious rituals and beliefs are always mixed in subtle fashion. The conjecture which is here pre- sented, on the basis of a remarkable conglomeration of motifs which otherwise would remain thoroughly heterogeneous - chthonian rites, snake-cult, solar worship, male cultic prostitution, the place of the queen mother, bisexuality - may help us to understand con- cretely the ambivalent character of the Zion theology. The appropriation of the omphalos myth in the pre-exilic temple circles was combined with the prophetic belief in the election of Zion. The significance and the effect of this synthesis upon nascent Judaism during the exilic and post-exilic times cannot be ascertained in a demonstrable manner, in view of the reticence of the documents. Nevertheless, the following tentative suggestions may be advanced for the purpose of eliciting further discussion. 1. In spite of the Jebus-inspired syncretism which officially pre- vailed at the temple of Solomon for more than three-and-a-half centuries, theologians of Yahwism attempted to maintain or to revive the faith in a Covenant God, as witnessed in particular by the reforms of Asa, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah and Josiah 1). Based originally on the Jebusite myth on the navel of the earth, the Zion theology became historicized into a theology of the election of David and Jerusalem 2). At the same time, a complex undercurrent persisted in the court and temple circles. Originally conceived as conditional upon man's historical response to covenant obligations, David's choice of Je- rusalem as an historical agency became mythicized into a motif of II 1943, p. 75; E.

After the destruction of Jerusalem in 587 B.

The myth of the omphalos resulted in a spatialization of the concept of presence.

The sense of an "eternal" mission, which is characteristic of certain forms of Judaism, thus transcending the historical relativity of other nations, may be traced, according to this hypothesis, not to Mosaic Yahwism but to Jebusite mythology. 4. The national trauma caused by the destruction of the temple in 587 B. C. resulted in the spread of a collective consciousness of sin, for the indictment of the nation, long repeated by the prophets, appeared now to be verified by events. Awareness of the national guilt, however, seems to have been expressed more often in cultic terms of impurity and uncleanness - words which connoted the realm of sexuality 1)- than in psychological terms of transgression, iniquity, rebelliousness and hardening of the heart, which the pre- exilic prophets had favored 2). To be sure, these prophets had for- mulated their interpretation of the Mosaic covenant quite often under the familiar metaphors of marriage and adultery 3), but they used sexual imagery almost exclusively in a moral rhetoric of trust and mistrust, loyalty and infidelity, self-giving and self-seeking love. During the exile, on the contrary, Ezekiel, a prophet who was also the son of a Jerusalem priest, employed generally the language of sexual purity and impurity no longer as a metaphorical tool of moral expression but as the speech of his sacerdotal concern for ritual cleanliness, purification and physical avoidance of ritual corruption 4). 1) "Jerusalem has gravely sinned; she has become an impurity" (nidhah, Lam. i 8; cf. vs. 17; MT niddah; see LXX, Aqu., Syr.); the word occurs especially in Ezekiel and the priestly legislation: Ezek. xviii 6; xxii 10; xxxvi 17; Lev. xii 2; xv 19 ff.; xx 21; Zech. xiii 1; 2 Chr. xxix 5; Ezra ix 11; etc. The growth of an oral body of legal interpretation led to rabbinic prescriptions and prohibitions (Mishnah, Tohoroth, "Niddah," passim; Babylonian Talmud, Seder Tohoroth I, "Niddah," passim). 2) G.

It may be observed that the poet of Job, like the pre-exilic prophets, used the priestly terminology of cleanness and uncleanness in the context of moral perfection and sinfulness (Job ix 30; xi 4; xiv 4; xv 14 f.; etc.), and that the whole dialogue should even be understood as an attempt to formulate dramatically a supra-moral, existential hamartiology; Job xlii 6; cf.

TERRIEN From the earliest times of Semitic culture, sources of ritual pol- lution seem to have been especially related to sexual secretions 1). It ensued that the whole realm of sexuality entered under the sus- picion of the risk of ritual impurity. Beginning with the exilic proph- ets, the notion of sinfulness remained concerned with social injustice, to be sure, but it also stressed ritual contacts, prohibitions, cleansing and expiation 2). While the available documents do not explicitly indicate the aware- ness of a link between the omphalos myth and the sexualizing process of the notion of sinfulness, it is probable that the exilic theology of Zion, while rejecting the chthonian and ophidian rites, solar cult, male prostitution and bisexuality, which had officially accompanied the worship of the Terra Mater in the Jerusalem temple during most of the Divided Monarchy, over-reacted against the persistent fas- cination of many J udahites with the fertility cults during the exile and even afterwards 3). The priestly members of the Zadokite families who reinterpreted the early traditions of Mosaic Yahwism and the the prophetic comparison of Israel with the unfaithful bride, may well be an unconscious by-product of the worship of the Terra Mater. Ezekiel's prescriptions for the new cultus bring together in the same context the theology of Zion as the navel of the earth with legislation for physical isolation and a topographical cordon sanitaire in an effort to prevent contamination from alien impurity: Ezek. xliv 5 ff.; xlv 1 ff.; etc. Cf.

VON RAD, Old Testament Theology, I, p. 272), but it was during the exile, when the political and cultic structures of national life had disappeared, that the descen- dants of the Jerusalem priest, among whom Ezekiel assumed apparently a pro- minent place, convinced many Judahites of the need for outward and therefore ritual signs of distinctiveness like circumcision, sabbath, and practises related to the clean and to the unclean. This trend received official sanction with the authori- tative acceptance of the Torah, in which the holiness legislation played a con- spicuous role. See W. GISPEN, "The Distinction Between Clean and Unclean," Oudt. St. V, 1948, pp. 190 ff.; K. ELLIGER, "Das Gesetz Leviticus 18," ZAW. LXVII, 1955, pp. 1 ff., especially 23; L. E.

The priestly legislation which now dominates the framework of the Torah accelerated a trend, among some purity-minded Jews, toward a devalorization of sexuality and a consequent diffidence toward womanhood 1), except as a maternal function 2) and in the context of heroism in devotion to the national cause 3). 4. If the growth of the emphasis on rites of purification for sin in the second temple is ascribed to the direct influence of, and the indirect reaction against, the Jebusite myth of the omphalos as trans- formed into a Zion theology, one must also relate to the same myth the alteration of the notion of faith which appeared to have taken place among the ritual and legal party. Within post-exilic Judaism, faith tended to confuse the demands of an always threatening as well as comforting God with the obedient performance of ritual acts of initiation and observance 4). 1) The Yahwist's tradition on the ideal of marital love (Gen. ii 24) represented for early Israel the highest view of monogamy in the ancient Near East, and was echoed in some respects by the erotic simplicity of the Song of Songs. Such a view, unencumbered with cultic prohibition on sexual uncleanness, must have been sufficiently widespread among some circles of the pre-exilic period. Other- wise, the prophets could not have expected to be understood when they compared Israel to the bride of Yahweh and the covenant to a marriage of trust and of mutual obligation. The ascetic tendencies which were markedly apparent in the post- exilic period (L. M. EPSTEIN, Sex Laws and Customs in Judaism, New York 1948, pp. 8 ff.) were probably related to the fear of sexual pollution that was stressed by the legislation of holiness. 2) The ritual concern for racial purity in the IVth century B.C. led not only to a ban on interracial marriage but also to the repudiation of foreign wives (Ezr. x 3, 44), a measure which implies the superiority of religious collective concerns over the respect for the individual feminine personality.

The existential quality of the pro- phetic and Jobian understanding of faith, of course, may be compatible with the joy of the "faithful" in Yahweh's commandments, as expressed, e.g., in Ps. cxix.

The ideology of Zion, which became central to the main form of Judaism in exilic and post-exilic times, appears to have carried with it a persistent ambivalence: on the one hand, it belonged to the archaic belief in mythical geography, which is unable to dissociate the sacred from the topos 1), and finds therein an excep- tionally powerful source of religious and sociological coherence. On the other hand, it participates, .through the prophetic interpretation of the Mosaic covenant, in the possibility to absorb a mythical view of space into a dynamic theology of time, based on a teleology of elec- tion, which is therefore open to religious, moral, and political trans- formation according to the changing conditions of history 2). 1) M.
