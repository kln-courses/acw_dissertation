<plain_text><page sequence="1">SANDA MUNJIC Leriano's Suffering Subjectivity; or, the Politics of Sentimentality in C?rcel de amor Se estudia en este art?culo la representaci?n del amor como sufrimiento en C?r cel de amor, con referencia al "Serm?n' de Diego de San Pedro. Tal concepto de amor viene construido en la cultura occidental desde la antig?edad cl?sica en los escritos literarios, filos?ficos, m?dicos y teol?gicos. Para analizar esta noci?n de amor propongo el concepto de la "sufriente subjetividad," que incluye dos manifestaciones hist?ricas: (i) la erotomania, la premoderna noci?n patol?gica de amor, o su forma est?tica, el amor cort?s; y (2) la invenci?n decimon?nica de la perversi?n del masoquismo. Al identificar los paralelos entre erotomania y/o amor cort?s con el masoquismo se analiza la performance de sufrimiento de Le riano, el protagonista de C?rcel de amor. El masoquista Leriano dramatiza su pasi?n de acuerdo con uno de los modelos dominantes de masculinidad medie val. Este modelo de la sufriente subjetividad masculina, difundido en el medioe vo principalmente en la l?rica amorosa, celebra los comportamientos que en la sociedad medieval tienen connotaci?n de nobleza, pero que desmienten la defi nici?n clara de los g?neros. Se demuestra c?mo el masoquista, adoptando la pose de v?ctima, ocupa el territorio de la subjetividad masculina y femenina, y as? ejerce control de una manera velada sobre el sujeto femenino. The preoccupation with the nature of love so dominated the cultural climate of late medieval Spain that Pedro C?tedra (157) describes the literary panorama of the period, in one instance, as inundated with sentimental fiction, and in an other, as a "selva de teor?a amorosa y pr?ctica literaria" (159). This intellectual tradition was the backdrop for Diego de San Pedro's contribution of two im portant titles to late medieval Spanish literature, Tractado de amores de Amalie y Lucenda (1491) and C?rcel de amor (1492).1 The two works comprise a the matic unit with his "Serm?n" (written ca. i48o's), a brief ars amatoria in which the author lays out the mock precepts for the behavior of a love-stricken no bleman and, to a lesser degree, for the lady who is the object of his desire. While these precepts, containing a stock of motifs standard in courtly love tradition,2 can be recognized at work in the portrayal of the male protagonists in both sen timental romances, this study focuses on Diego de San Pedro's early modern REVISTA CANADIENSE DE ESTUDIOS HISP?NICOS 32.2 (INVIERNO 2008)</page><page sequence="2">204 bestseller C?rcel de amor? A reading of C?rcel de amor as an episode in the spe cific vein of courtly love or fin amors tradition that explores the suffering of unrequited love can help us understand the characters' perplexing behavior, and unravel the stages in the development of the static, rhetorical plot of this puzzling work.4 The central theme of the text, the representation of Leriano's love as suf fering, follows the blueprint of courtly love aesthetics that San Pedro lays out in "Sermon." This aesthetics encourages Leriano, the protagonist of C?rcel de amor, to derive pleasure from subjugating himself to a cultural norm of passive masculine subjectivity, the norm that had been promoted largely through an influential medium of medieval lyrical poetry. The allegorical staging of that process in C?rcel de amor exemplifies how, in Kaja Silverman's words, the "masochist acts out in the exaggerated, anthropomorphic, and disruptive way the process whereby subjects are culturally 'spoken"' {Male 213). In other words, Leriano's behavior projects the cultural values of suffering, of submission to the lady of his choice, and of persistence in his amorous commitment - the values that are articulated through lyrical poetry that shapes his sensibility. San Pedro's narrative thus represents the process by which the masochistic Leriano, a fic tional double of a medieval nobleman, enacts amorous behavior that in his cultural environment carries a connotation of refined, aristocratic masculine subjectivity. Diego de San Pedro combined in C?rcel de amor a representation of the characters' affective states as explored in lyrical poetry with a narrative of mili tary deeds, thus alluding to the medieval topos of "arms and letters." In empha sizing the "arms" pole of the topos that is manifested in the military episode in C?rcel de amor, Francisco M?rquez Villanueva ^C?rcel de amor") argued that this romance was, in effect, a "political novel." He thus countered the near-con sensus among Hispanists that sentimentality was a distinctive feature of this most representative text of what is commonly termed "sentimental fiction."5 M?rquez Villanueva contended that, through the unsympathetic portrayal of a tyrannical king, Diego de San Pedro critiqued the rise of the Inquisition and of the Catholic Monarchs' absolute rule. Barbara Weissberger redirected the po litical thesis of C?rcel de amor in pointing out its indebtedness to aristocratic ideology, and in arguing that the sentimental and the political in this romance "are but two sides of the same cultural coin" (308), distinguished solely by "the values used to euphemize the power displayed therein: courtliness on the one hand, and chivalry on the other" (309). While disagreeing with aspects of Eliza beth-Teresa Howe's earlier feminist perspective, Weissberger joins her in ex posing the ways in which patriarchal ideology condones the masculine exercise of power over the female character within the textual space of sentimental fic tion. I propose to continue in the direction pointed out by Howe and Weiss</page><page sequence="3">205 berger, and revisit the politics of sentimentality in C?rcel de amor through a study of Leriano's passion. By identifying Leriano's behavior as masochistic we can analyze the mechanisms of power that underlie the representation of love as suffering in this romance, and explain why Leriano rejects his lady's final offer and commits suicide. Implied in the task is a look at how premodern males scrutinized their notion of socially valued models of masculinity through tex tual representations of amorous experience. C?rcel de amor starts as the character named El Auctor narrates in the first person an event that he mediated the previous year in the distant kingdom of Macedonia. Returning home from a war, he noticed on the way a wild man carrying a shining statue of a woman, and dragging behind him a prisoner pleading for help. El Auctor follows the prisoner (Leriano) and his captor (the personified Desire) through the harsh landscape of the Sierra Morena as they climb a mountain crowned by a prison of love to which the captive is to be de livered. Having arrived there, El Auctor witnesses the tortures that the belea guered lover is enduring in the allegorical prison due to his unrequited love for Laureola, the kings daughter. El Auctor agrees to intervene with Laureola on Leriano's behalf, hoping to attain from her an unidentified galard?n, a reward for the lover's service of amorous suffering. El Auctor appeals to Laureola in his own words for her to assuage Leriano's suffering; he delivers Leriano's letters to her, and eventually obtains from her a written response for the lover. Mean while, subjugated by the force of desire, Leriano suffers passively in the prison. When he receives a reply from Laureola, he is recovered from his lethargy, and makes his way to the court, where he furtively exchanges glances with her. Le riano's jealous rival Persio perceives this exchange, and falsely accuses Laureola to her father the King of tarnishing his honor. Consequently, the King con demns his daughter to prison, where she awaits execution despite numerous entreaties that her life be spared. Leriano rises in armed rebellion against the King, and, after rescuing Lau reola from the prison, places her immediately under her uncle's protection lest her reputation be sullied again. Once Laureola's name is cleared and Persio killed by Leriano's men, the King pardons his daughter. This event brings an end to the war, and restores the kingdom to order. The King forgives Leriano his rebellion, and, while supposedly appeasing Persio's relatives, asks Leriano to stay away from the court. The new obstacle to approaching Laureola rekindles Leriano's amorous suffering. After Laureola appears to have rejected all further communication with the love-stricken Leriano, he participates from his death bed in a standard medieval misogynous topos of la querelle de femmes, then swallows Laureola's letters and dies from emaciation, one of the classic symp toms of lovesickness.</page><page sequence="4">206 EARLY MODERN PSYCHOLOGY OF PASSIONS AND MASOCHISTIC SUBJECTIVITY The representation of Leriano's amorous suffering is based in the early modern psychology of passions. In medieval Western culture, desire and emotions such as love were classified under the category of "passion," which was an approxi mate equivalent of the contemporary category of "emotion."6 Since "passion" etymologically means "suffering," this confluence of semantics and of premod ern psychological categories created a conceptual framework according to which excessive and unrequited love was necessarily understood as suffering.7 The notion of love as suffering and endless longing became a prophecy that fulfilled itself in medieval and early modern literature's extensive focus on dif ferent scenarios of impossible love. These scenarios provided space for the ex ploration of lovers' torments proceeding from the force of unfulfilled desire. Contemporary literary scholarship has interpreted the resultant aesthetics of love as suffering through the concepts of courtly love or fin amors. However, this literary convention, in its varied manifestations in poetic and prose genres from medieval through early modern period, is only a segment of a much wider cultural trend that fetishizes amorous suffering. The disruptive nature of pas sionate love was in addition of central interest to non-fictional - philosophical, medical, and theological - texts that dealt with the issues of human affectivity and sexuality in Western culture. Thus in "Phaedrus" Plato celebrated the sub limation of passionate love as a form of mania or divine madness. When diag nosed as tormented lovers' symptoms, medieval physicians classified the signs of love similar to those described by Plato as mania through pathology they called amor her eos. In their premodern scientific point of view, if a lover pas sively endured frustration of the desire that ensued from the sight of the be loved, as exemplified in Leriano's case, this would indicate a dysfunction of rea son.8 On their part, theologians posited love, epitomized in Christ's Passion, as the central concept of Christianity. For centuries, they attempted to contain through teaching the disruptive force, of the postlapsarian manifestation of un bridled desire in which the poets indulged.9 On the basis of such fictional and non-fictional intertextually related representations that emphasize the quality of suffering in the experience of love, I have identified the concept, and the pose of "suffering subjectivity," as central to a premodern subject's self-fashioning. By using the term "subjectivity" I refer to the Lacanian concept of human subject as constructed and in this sense collective.10 Although Timothy J. Reiss warns against an indiscriminate application of the term "subjectivity" lest we should impose contemporary Western culture's views on (temporally or geo graphically) different cultural senses of what it is to be a person, I find the term particularly useful. Unlike Reiss - who uses this term to mean people's cultur ally specific experience of what it is to be a person11 - I take "subjectivity" as a</page><page sequence="5">207 concept through which to theorize constructions of culturally specific models of personhood. The term "subjectivity" is therefore effective in this context be cause it points simultaneously to the human condition of subjection to cultural forces, and in a rather informal sense, because it refers to his or her "interior," personal - that is to say, "subjective" - experience of the world. In other words, the term "subjectivity" draws together the fact of a human animal's subjection to external ideological influences in the process of socialization, with the fact that the foremost interiority of the human subject - his or her ways of experi encing, cultivating and manifesting emotions - is constructed through the same processes. Thus, contrary to a romantic view of passion as a sign of one's sin cerity or distinctiveness, subjectivity even in this most "personal" or "individ ual" sense of private, "one's own" emotional experience, is conceived of as al ways already ideologically constructed, and by implication as collective. An examination of culturally constructed passive/passionate/suffering subjectivity in medieval texts indicates that premodern authors were aware, at least implic itly, of the collective nature of subjectivity. The endlessly repeated literary motif of an anguished lover was imitated, reproduced and questioned - if not stead fastly on the courtly stage on which medieval elite interacted, then through textual stagings of a lyrical "I" - as a model of courtliness in the performance of socially valued forms of masculinity and nobility in the Middle Ages and early modern period.12 That is to say, the particular ways of being in love as explored by the predominantly male authors in courtly literature created literary models that played into medieval notions of what it meant to be an exemplary noble man. A close look at the premodern cross-referencing of fictional and non-fic tional discourses on love and sexuality suggests that courtly love and erotoma nia are related manifestations of the premodern paradigm of suffering subjec tivity: the pathologizing of eros precedes and underlies the courtly love aesthet ics of suffering. This privileged, suffering model of predominantly masculine subjectivity in premodern Western culture - that could allegedly be experi enced by heroes only, such noble exemplars of masculinity as Leriano - was re invented in nineteenth century psychoanalytical discourse as a perversion called masochism.13 There are a variety of features that can be recognized in a com parative study of erotomania or courtly love and masochism, both in terms of their formal characteristics, and in terms of their implications for gendered identity. Jacques Lacan's study of courtly love {Seminar VII 139-54) and Gilles Deleuze's study of masochism provide the basis for Slavoj Zizek's subsequent association of courtly love with masochism. Lacan described the emphasis on the workings of desire rather than on its fulfillment as featured in courtly love literature in the following terms: "The techniques involved in courtly love ... are</page><page sequence="6">208 techniques of holding back, of suspension, of amor interruptus. The stages courtly love lays down ... are expressed in terms that Freud uses in his Three Essays as belonging to the sphere of foreplay" (Seminar VII152). The paradox of foreplay, suggests Lacan, is that it exists in a certain opposition to the pleasure principle. Consequently, the pleasure of courtly love technique itself consists in "the pleasure of desiring ... the pleasure of experiencing unpleasure" (Seminar VII152). The aspect of courtly love that Lacan describes as "pleasure of unpleas ure" is a version of one of the most conventionally recognized features of maso chism, described as "pleasure in pain." Zizek furthermore observes that the treatment of desire within a courtly love formula is "a matter of courtesy and etiquette," that "it has nothing to do with some elementary passion overflowing all barriers, immune to all social rules. We are dealing," explains Zizek, "with a strict fictional formula, with a social game of 'as if/ where a man pretends that his sweetheart is the inaccessi ble Lady" (91).14 It is this quality of feigning, of simulation, of "as if behavior that allows Zizek to further associate courtly love with masochism. For, just as courtly love is a game or an "as if behavior, masochism itself - according to Gilles Deleuze - is another kind of "as if," simulated behavior. It is a theatral ized, staged erotic ritual that is always conscious, always controlled and always directed by the supposed victim. Both Deleuze (75) and Zizek (91-92) empha size the contractual nature of masochism: the (supposed) victim and the domi nant partner act with the understanding that the "victim" directs and controls the infliction of pain that he or she receives. These two phenomena - erotomania manifested in aestheticized form as courtly love, and masochism - have important implications for gendered iden tity. They have been described as pathologies that afflict mostly men in such a way that they feminize them and thus undermine the phallic norm of masculine subjectivity. Silverman describes masochistic masculinities as "those which open in a variety of ways onto the domain of femininity" (Male 3). In Silver man's (3) account, masochistic males deviate from conventional masculinity because their subjectivity is characterized by the traits that conventionally signal the feminine. Erotomania was likewise perceived as destabilizing medieval con ceptions of gender, and as carrying the male over onto "the domain of feminin ity ... the symptoms of the disease 'unman' the lover. As a patient he is passive, helpless and vulnerable. The signs of lovesickness ... connote feminine and in fantile behavior" (Wack 151). These moments that associate masochism with erotomania and courtly love provide the basis for my reading of C?rcel de amor in which I identify Leriano's behavior as masochistic.</page><page sequence="7">209 EXTERIORIZATIONS OF THE SELF IN A MEDIEVAL CHRONOTOPE AND IN MASOCHISTIC FANTASY The two related manifestations of suffering subjectivity, courtly love and maso chism, are constituted as fantasies - often expressed in literature15 - of eroti cized masculine subjection to the illusory control of a female object of desire.16 In the case of C?rcel de amor, Leriano's masochistic fantasy of his eroticized subjection to the illusory power of "dominatrix" Laureola is represented through an allegorical vision.17 As Mikhail Bakhtin's study of chronotope indi cates, vision literature offers specific conditions for representation of human subject, which for our purpose accommodate the staging of Leriano's maso chistic fantasy. By "chronotope" Bakhtin refers "to the intrinsic connectedness of temporal and spatial relationships" that "determine[s] to a significant degree the image of man in literature" (85). Since time and space that configure the chronotope in medieval literature structured as vision are of a primarily sym bolic and/or allegorical nature, they provide conditions for the creation of like wise symbolic or allegorical characters (Bakhtin 156). The exposition of the theme of desire in C?rcel de amor unfolds through a series of allegorical images in the opening scene of the romance that validate Bakhtin's thesis. El Auctor notices on the pathway a "caballero ... feroz" (4), who "levava en la mano isquierda un escudo de azero muy fuerte y en la derecha una imagen femenil entallada en una piedra muy clara, la cual era de tan estrema hermosura que me turbava la vista" (4). The figure of a wild man18 that sym bolizes medieval understanding of desire as animalistic, and a generic statue of a female - the view of which alone suffices to unsettle the observer - function to represent human experience "in its archetypal aspect, not as an individualized sequence of actual events" (Vitz 40). Leriano's desire is presented not as a sin gular experience but as just one instance of the medieval authors' interest in the workings of desire, and of its ill effects on man's health and free will. Not even when the figure of Laureola replaces the generic statue that symbolizes an object of Leriano's desire is she individualized through a description of her appear ance, of her particular motivations or circumstances. All that we know of Laureola is that she is a king's daughter - a princess, and therefore by antono masia (as Cervantes would have it) an object of Leriano's love.19 As James Man drell puts it, "neither of these characters - nor any of the others in their world - move beyond the idealized and carefully stylized presentation of his or her type as prescribed by the role that he or she plays in the fiction of courtly love" (100). Due to the characters' stylized roles; due to their function of "human vectors" that direct actions caused by forces of passion, reason, or legal codes into conflicting and insoluble situations, it would be problematic to attribute to those characters psychological depth, such as displayed in the capacity for con scious decision making or moral responsibility. One could argue that this faux</page><page sequence="8">210 pas has been committed by some of the past scholarship that validated Leriano's behavior as exemplary because he obeyed his passion, but charged Laureola with cruelty because she did not correspond to his feelings.20 Having entered the sinister tower that stands for Leriano's prison of love, El Auctor describes for the reader the allegorical scene he witnesses. He sees a man set permanently in flames, "sienpre se quemava y nunca se acabava de quemar" (8); crowned with a crown of sharp iron spikes, "dos due?as lastimeras con rostros llorosos y tristes le serv?an y adornavan, poni?ndole con crueza en la cabe?a una corona de unas puntas de hierro sin ninguna piedad, que le traspasavan todo el celebro" (8); and assaulted with a halberd by "un negro ... [que] ven?a diversas vezes a echalle una visarma" (8). While described in a highly euphemistic manner, the imagery that constitutes the allegorical scene of Leriano's masochistic fantasy employs a panoply of methods for inflicting pain and for disciplinary practices customary in medieval and early modern times. Thus the representation of Leriano's fantasy in C?rcel de amor appears designed according to John Noyes's (see 5, 10-12). thesis that masochistic practice appro priates for erotic purposes society's corrective and punitive technologies.21 The fantasy is expanded in a mode of psychomachia as a number of mental faculties and passions of premodern psychology work in unison to manufacture Leria no's suffering subjectivity. The personified Deseo, assisted by Tormento opens the doors to all the other pains; Afici?n burns Leriano's entrails, while Ansia and Pasi?n crown his head with iron spikes.22 Leriano takes center stage amid his pleasurable torments - in El Auctor s own words, "en una prisi?n dulce para su voluntad y amarga para su vida" (14), rendered literally, in a prison "sweet to his will and bitter for his life." Leriano's mental suffering caused by unrequited love is thus represented through the allegory of the prison of love and a series of physical tortures that take place in it. This allegory serves to exteriorize Leriano's innermost feelings in a visual, dramatized scene. Zizek explains that such "total self-externalization of masochist's most intimate passions" (92) is one of the most significant fea tures of this perversion. Since the space in C?rcel de amor is not literal or physi cal, but functions in order to receive representations of the structures of the self,23 it accommodates the externalizing aspect of masochistic fantasy in the allegorical mode. The resultant inseparability of the "exterior" space, of the set ting of the romance's action (Sierra Morena, the court, the battlefield) and of the character's interior world (Leriano's emotions represented through the alle gorical prison of love) gives a dreamlike quality to the spaces of C?rcel de amor. These regions are constituted as a fantasy populated on the same diegetic plane by the characters, and by the allegorical creatures that represent and act out the characters' own emotional experiences. In such surreal, suspended reality, the characters function as pawns on a chessboard in this particular case study of the</page><page sequence="9">211 laws of desire. Through a variety of contrived situations that loosely constitute the plot of the novel, they explore the contradictory, tacit conventions of courtly love. At the same time, such (allegorical) staging of the function of desire pre vents us, as observed earlier, from carrying out a properly psychological analysis of the characters - of their motivations, their guilt, merit or responsibilities. The "surrealism" of the masochistic game that, in Zizek's definition, "suspends so cial reality" but "fits easily into that everyday reality" (92), effectively describes the chronotope of C?rcel de amor. The merging of the characters interiority and of his surroundings into the single, surreal chronotope of C?rcel de amor likewise naturalizes Leriano's off-beat behavior: his self-described torment to El Auctor while in the prison; his ability to abruptly deliver himself from the prisons torture chamber to visit the court; his sudden awakening from appar ent passivity into battle-readiness; and his subsequent and automatic relapse into passivity and suicide. The protagonist's behavior is rarely questioned; in stead, it is accepted and condoned by all the witnesses to his suffering - often including those readers who romanticize his conduct as a case of overwhelming love. LERIANO'S MASOCHISTIC GAME In the first part of his "Serm?n," where Diego de San Pedro sets out to instruct men on how to govern their desires and properly serve their ladies, he says of an exemplary lover: E lo que m?s deve proveer es que no Heve la persona tras el desseo, porque no yerre con priessa lo que puede acertar con espacio, que le har? passar muchas vezes por donde no cunple, y buscar mensajeros que no le convienen y embiar cartas que le da?en, y bordar invenciones que lo publiquen. (174) And yet, as we have seen, C?rcel de amor opens with exactly such a scene, and proceeds through exactly such imprudent actions. The image of Leriano guided by a traditional symbol of desire in medieval literature discloses that the pro tagonist of this love story is already well in error so far as the management of his passions is concerned. Literally "seduced"24 - led aside/away - by desire, Leria no will continue to commit mistakes against which the "Serm?n" warns. He will procure a messenger, and will write letters that will produce harm. Apart from the exteriorization of the subject's emotions through an alle gory, the text provides additional moments for a series of exteriorizations so that the masochistic character's "most intimate desires become objects of con tract and composed negotiation" (Zizek 92). Leriano's desires become subject to negotiation in the communications that he carries out with Laureola. By means of El Auctor s interventions, and of his own letters to Laureola, Leriano repeat</page><page sequence="10">212 edly attempts to win a reward (galard?n) from his lady through emotional blackmail; this is, of course, the succinct plot summary of this romance. But, what is that reward, and how is he to gain it? The "Serm?n" elucidates many of the puzzles we encounter in C?rcel if a list of contradictory advice and para doxical conceits could be called an "elucidation." It instructs the lover to pro ceed with caution and rather lose his life than risk the reputation of his lady when trying to obtain a reward: "Todo amador deve antes perder la vida que escurescer la fama de la que sirviere, haviendo por mejor recebir la muerte cal lando su pena, que merecerla trayendo su cuidado a publicaci?n" ("Serm?n" 174). However, he should never relinquish his service to the lady: "nunca, se?ores, vos apart?is de seguir y servir y querer, que no hay compa??a m?s ami gable que el mal que vos viene de quien tanto quer?is, pues ella lo quiere" (177 78). Apparently, the ultimate good a lover can expect is to enjoy the pain caused by the beloved's aloofness, since that's her will - and, we know that the lady wants her lover to suffer because she is not yielding to his supplications. It is therefore important that the lover consider the merits of suffering: "?Pues qu? m?s quer?is de vuestras amigas sino que con sus penas esperiment?is vuestra fortaleza?" ("Serm?n" 179). Moreover, claims the "Serm?n," the lover should prefer to endure the pain of living to freedom from his pain granted by death. And yet, death is a viable option, for if such were the outcome of one's passion, he should consider, in a fashion of a mystic, that "en la muerte est? la vida" (179). Finally, all that an exemplary lover can truly ask for from his lady is em pathy: "el que es affinado amador no quiere de su amiga otro bien sino que le pese de su mal" ("Sermon" 181). Paradoxically, if all that the lady needs to give in return for her lover's service is acknowledgement of his suffering, that means that the lover's suffering in itself is both the . means of acquiring the reward from the lady, and the reward itself. Looking at this problem from a different angle, Zizek explains the function of the inaccessible Lady in the courtly love game: "The Lady therefore functions as a unique short circuit in which the Object of desire itself coincides with the force that prevents its attainment - in a way, the object 'is' its own withdrawal, its own retraction" (96). The lady serves as the structuring element around which the lover organizes the exercise of his narcis sistic passions: as the object is its own withdrawal, the lover's desire turns out to be its own purpose. We can observe how the object withdraws, and desire ac quires self-fulfilling autonomy, in the process of Leriano's and Laureola's com munication and El Auctors mediation. In the first letter that Leriano directs to the princess, he asks that her own letter in reply be payment for the suffering he is enduring as a result of her beauty. He argues that her beauty caused him to love, which in turn caused de sire. From this desire he felt pain, and that pain incited his daring to write to her: "tu hermosura caus? el afici?n, y el afici?n el deseo, y el deseo la pena, y la</page><page sequence="11">213 pena el atrevimiento" (C?rcel 18). By successfully applying the premises of amo rous discourse on lovesickness and female beauty as its cause, Leriano charges Laureola with responsibility for his suffering. This suffering allows him to adopt the role of masochistic victim, and to feign submission with respect to the sup posedly dominant lady. The force of suffering is the chief binding element in Leriano's masochistic pose by which he ensnares the dominatrix of his choice: "por mucho que me pagues, sienpre pensar? que me quedas en deuda" (18). According to the rules that govern the fictional universe of the kingdom of Macedonia, to give in to Leriano's persuasion to requite with a galard?n his suffering - or his love, for suffering is allegedly the evidence of love - would constitute for Laureola engagement in socially inappropriate behavior.25 As a matter of fact, Laureola indicates that anything she might do to alleviate Leria no's misery could risk the loss of her reputation: "Pues si el bevir de Leriano ha de ser con la muerte desta [fama], t? juzga a qui?n con m?s raz?n devo ser pia dosa, a m? o a su mal" (21). While requiring Laureolas assent to the impossible requests in his game of love - which, in agreement with courtly love conven tion, never includes a marriage proposal - Leriano puts forth his own condi tions for the prolongation of his suffering. In keeping with a similar maxim presented in the "Serm?n," ElAuctor encourages Leriano to endure in his pain: para satisfaci?n de ti mismo m?s te conviene bevir para que sufras que morir para que no penes. Esto digo porque de tu pena te veo gloriar; segund tu dolor, gran corona es para ti que se diga que toviste esfuer?o para sofrirlo; los fuertes en las grandes fortunas muestran mayor cora??n ... Cata que con larga vida todo se alcan?a; ten esperan?a en tu fe, que su prop?sito de Laureola podr? mudar y tu firmeza nunca. (23) The show of lovesickness thus becomes not so much a proof of feelings for the lady, but the test of lover s perseverance, itself a virtue: the greater his pain and his ability to endure it, the greater his fame in the hall of courtly love values. The lover's performance of passion and the woman's resistance to succumb to its pressure are presented as a battle of will and rhetoric: Is the lover going to outdo the lady's resistance by persevering in his pain, or is the lady going to persevere in defying the lover's coercive show of passion? Will the lover formulate more persuasively his impossible requests to the lady, or will she formulate more convincingly her counter-arguments to the demands placed upon her? The exhibition of Leriano's suffering serves as the most compelling argument in this pseudo-amorous process that transforms the game of courtship into that of verbal persuasion and debate.26 The negotiation of satisfaction of Leriano's desires is interrupted and thus postponed by a long military episode in the middle of the romance. Resusci tated from the paralysis of his own (allegorical) prison, Leriano performs as an</page><page sequence="12">214 exemplary military leader in the civil strife into which the kingdom is thrown when he undertakes to save Laureolas life. Having rescued Laureola from her (real) prison, Leriano's previously exhibited "overflowing" passion does not prevent him from safeguarding Laureolas honor. He places her under the pro tection of her uncle Galio until she is pardoned by the King, her father. Once Laureola s name is cleared, her life spared, and the conflict resolved, the King asks Leriano to stay away from the court until Persio's relatives are appeased. This latest obstacle to approach Laureola ignites anew Leriano's passions. How ever, since Leriano never made an attempt on Laureolas honor in order to quench his passion when he rescued her, this clearly shows that it is not the woman, but the interdiction that drives his desire. Leriano now resumes his suffering and his amorous service through El Auctors embassy and asks if there is "alguna forma onesta para que la pudiese ver y hablar" (C?rcel 59). Faced with Laureola's rejection, Leriano writes his final letter in which he reiterates his threat to commit suicide: "si todav?a te plaze que muera, h?zmelo saber, que gran bien har?s a la vida, pues no ser? desdichada del todo ... a lo menos el fin ser? en descanso, porque t? lo das, el qual, si ver no me quieres, ser? for?ado que veas" (61). Leriano makes Laureola again responsible for his soirowful con dition by spelling out for her that her steadfast resolution will bring death upon him. This exhibition of lover s pain is accompanied by a not-so-subtle show of force contained not only in psychological terms in the charge of cruelty against the lady, in making her responsible for his impending death, but also in the final threat: "el fin, si ver no me quieres, ser? for?ado que veas." The threat for mulated literally as "it will be forced upon you to see" thus discloses Laureolas utter lack of control, and Leriano's power concealed under the guise of suffering and submission in this masochistic game. In response to this request disguised as supplication, Laureola writes her final letter. In it, she indicates to Leriano a possibility of granting him el galard?n m?ximo: Mucho te ruego que te esfuerces como fuerte y te remedies como discreto. No pongas en peligro tu vida y en disputa mi onrra, pues tanto la deseas, que se dir? muriendo t? que galardono los servicios quitando las vidas; lo que, si al rey ven?o de d?as, se dir? al rev?s; tern?s en el reino toda la parte que quisieres, crecer? tu honrra, doblar? tu renta, sobir? tu estado, ninguna cosa ordenar?s que revocada te sea; ass? que biviendo causar?s que me juzguen agradecida, y muriendo que me tengan por mal acondicionada; aunque por otra cosa no te esfor?ases sino por el cuidado que tu pena me da, lo devr?as hazer. (62-63) Just as in the entire romance, in this paragraph also we can recognize San Pedro's masterful rhetorical games, resulting in a "speech that denies itself in endless subtleties of non-information" (Dunn 94). Its effect is the undermining</page><page sequence="13">215 of any attempt to confidently propose a fixed and singular meaning of the text. What is it that Laureola means exactly by this promise? Aware of the textual trap, I would nevertheless like to support the following interpretation: Laureola is offering Leriano marriage.27 She begs him not to commit suicide, because that would ruin her reputation (a reputation so important to Leriano that he did not jeopardize it even when he rescued Laureola from her father s prison). Laureola fears that she would lose this reputation if Leriano were to take his own life, for everyone would consider her ungrateful for refusing him a reward (a verdict that indeed was passed on her by a part of twentieth-century scholarship, as can be seen in examples quoted in note 20). However, if both she and Leriano out live her father, Laureola will be able to demonstrate that she rewards the service done to her with appropriate galardones: she will allow Leriano to have all that he wishes for in the kingdom - and, as we know, Laureola appears to be one of these prizes. She will augment his honor - we may assume that could happen by association with her, the princess. She will raise his status - a point that proves the previous, since Leriano is a son of a duke, a title of nobility inferior only to that of prince. None of his orders will be revoked - which implies that he will have the foremost rule in the kingdom. Such power only a king may have, in this case again we may assume the future husband of the princess-heiress to the throne. Diego de San Pedro may mislead a hasty reader from recognizing the significant message of Laureola's words in this paragraph, because they are fol lowed by her decisive order to Leriano not to communicate with her any longer: "No quiero m?s dezirte porque no digas que me pides esperan?a y te do con sejo; plugiera a Dios que fuera tu demanda justa, porque vieras que como te aconsejo en lo uno te satisfiziera en lo otro; y ass? acabo para sienpre de m?s responderte ni o?rte&gt;&gt; (63). Laureola additionally forbids El Auctor to appear before her eyes again because, she adds, his visits have been raising suspicions and causing her danger. At this point, the plot takes a surprising turn. Thus far, El Auctor has been interpreting for Leriano (and for the reader) all Laureola's actions and words in the course of the text. He has up to now always found ways of seeing signs of hope in Laureolas "inexplicable" (in El Auctor s view) hesitations or perturba tions, even in what (for readers) were Laureola's most evident rejections (see Mandrell). But now, after all the promises implicit in Laureola's discourse - which offer as much and more hope for fulfillment of Leriano's desires than any previous reply - El Auctor is stricken by despair. He describes his own reaction to Laureola's words in the following way: Nunca por todo el camino sospiros y gemidos me fallecieron; y quando llegu? a Leriano dile la carta, y como acab? de leella d?xele que ni se esfor?ase, ni se alegrase, ni recibiese consuelo, pues tanta raz?n av?a para que deviese morir; el qual me respondi? que m?s</page><page sequence="14">216 que hasta all? me ten?a por suyo, porque le aconsejava lo propio; y con boz y color mortal comen?o a condolerse. (63) The text never explains what exactly are these many good reasons for Leriano to die.28 Now we recognize, just as Leriano, that his ambassador is not just a sym pathetic passer-by innocently involved in the plot of Leriano s blackmail. One could argue that El Auctor, an interested observer who manipulates readers by mediating the text for them through his own interpretations, represents the role of poets in his society. These poets bring about the ruin of many a naive noble man who falls victim of love perils due to the poets' irresponsible celebration of unrequited love. Thus Leriano's character represents lovers who, confused be tween fiction and reality of love, engage in the staging of interminable games of courtship as a way of imitating the refined models of masculinity portrayed in lyrical poetry. Leriano derives narcissistic pleasure from being able to sustain his desire for Laureola, a result that he achieves by repeatedly demanding from her small attentions, attentions that within the laws of reality of this fiction are impossible rewards that she could not but withhold. However, the moment when Laureola proposes marriage to Leriano and decidedly prohibits him from continuing with his "harassment" - both El Auc tor and Leriano recognize that they cannot continue with their game. She bursts their bubble, so to speak. Such a turn of events is justified by, if not a telling betrayal of courtly love's attitudes toward marriage. "Love" understood in this work primarily as passion of desire - which means "unrequited" love - can have no place in marriage, the very purpose of which is to satisfy sexual desire. Andreas Capellanus's ironic treatment illustrates this point: But I am greatly surprised that you wish to misapply the term "love" to that marital affection which husband and wife are expected to feel for each other after marriage, since everybody knows that love can have no place between husband and wife. They may be bound to each other by a great and immoderate affection, but their feeling cannot take the place of love, because it cannot fit under the true definition of love. For what is love but an inordinate desire to receive passionately a furtive and hidden embrace? (100) Capellanus allows for the existence of "great and immoderate affection" be tween the spouses, but distinguishes that affection from love, which he defines essentially as desire "to receive passionately a furtive and hidden embrace." Consequently, in light of San Pedro's interpretation of courtly love system that, as in Capellanus's case, appears to equate love with desire, Laureola's apparent proposal of marriage can only be understood as "non-love." This means that El Auctors and Leriano's despair in response to Laureola's words is not caused by her final rejection of Leriano, but by her marriage proposal to him. Through a</page><page sequence="15">217 proposition of marriage, she has finally revealed that she does not love, that is to say, that she does not desire, or rather does not want to desire Leriano, and would moreover put a stop to his pleasure of desiring her by requiting his love in marriage, if and when that contract might be finalized. Within the ludic uni verse of this romance, the disappearance of desiring as the motor of the action - desiring made possible by the postponing of satisfaction, by the sustenance of the "as if' game, by the disavowal of reality - is the end of the novelistic action.29 As San Pedro narrates the story of Pyramus and Thisbe in the "Serm?n," he poignantly suggests: "por cierto m?s grave que la de P?ramo es la muerte del desseo; porque la una acaba y la otra dura" (183). In accordance with this phi losophy of love, and with the aesthetic of masculine subjectivity that it elicits, Leriano chooses the lesser of two evils: he prefers his own death to the perishing of desire. Thus Leriano's death should not be interpreted as a tragic outcome of an unrequited love. Rather, his death represents a sardonic commentary on that amorous convention according to which a medieval nobleman is defined through his ability to desire and to suffer. By dying, Leriano brings the para doxical arguments underlying the aesthetics that celebrates unrequited love to their ultimate and absurd conclusion. Faced with the choice between a charac ter's death and an evanescence of desire to end the story, San Pedro opts for the death of the character as an aesthetically more effective closure of the text. The ending of C?rcel de amor that involves the protagonist's death artfully mimics tragedy, whereas the closure involving the perishing of desire would constitute the story's inconsequential dissolution. It would have turned out to have been much ado about nothing.30 THE POWER THAT LIES BENEATH: AMOROUS SUFFERING AND MASCULINITY Suffering subjectivity as construed in late medieval and early modern amorous literature represents one of the two dominant and competing sensibilities tai lored for the benefit of early modern man's self-fashioning. These sensibilities are epitomized in the topos of arms and letters. The association of amorous pas sion with the exercise of letters, as employed for the production of lyrical po etry, gives place to an ideal, yet passive, hence, non-masculine type of nobleman that is featured in such poetry. His passivity results from his superior sensibility, worthy of a lyrical poet caught in the web of emotional contradictions that ar rest his rational function and his public activity. This type is contrasted by the ideal of a knight-warrior, whose dedication to the exercise of arms epitomizes masculine activity, associated with decision-making and with rationality. In his first letter to Laureola, the passion-stricken Leriano expresses his indecisiveness: "mas en saber que escrivo para ti se turba el seso y se pierde el sentido, y desta causa antes que lo comen?ase tove conmigo grand confusi?n; mi fe dez?a que osase; tu grandeza que temiese" (18). The King's even higher station than</page><page sequence="16">218 Laureola's does not make Leriano hesitate in committing an even greater trans gression than sending letters to Laureola - that is, rising in armed rebellion against him. In addressing his troops before the battle, Leriano concludes with a decisive call for action, "y porque me parece, segund se adere?a el conbate, que somos costre?idos a dexar con las obras las hablas, cada uno se vaya a su estan cia" (58). The contrasting representations of Leriano as a passive, indecisive lover, and as an active, rational warrior, illustrate a medieval aristocratic male's dilemma in deciding which model of masculinity to inhabit. Paradoxically, the two positions cover the territories of both masculine and feminine subjectivity, epitomized in a series of Aristotelian binaries that align the male with activity, and the female with passivity. Thus courtly love as an aestheticized form of erotomania unsettles the strict definition of gender identity for the medieval male. As a form of masochistic behavior, it allows the masculine to territorialize the domain of what Western patriarchy has allotted to the female subjectivity. At the same time, the pose of suffering and submission to the lady that the male takes in courtly love literature serves as an instrument of concealing the mecha nisms of power that allow the masculine voice to dominate the female addressee of his plaints. As Leriano's case proves, whether inhabiting the active chivalric, or the passive lyrical subjectivity, the medieval nobleman never relinquishes the position of power, thus effectively erasing the female voice and subjectivity from the map of medieval discursivity. University of Toronto NOTES 1 These are the first publication dates of Diego de San Pedro's two romances. Keith Whinnom presents in detail the composition and publication history of the author's works in the introduction to his edition of Obras completas (i: 34-48). 2 The contemporary scholarship has rejected the list of rules that C. S. Lewis (2-3) proposed in The Allegory of Love as guiding the courtly love convention. By using the term "precepts" I do not mean to imply that there was a prior system of rules that directed overtly the thematic composition of courtly love literature. However, it was possible to derive from the existing literature something akin to a formal system of courtly love precepts, for San Pedro writes his "Sermon" precisely as a courtly ars amatoria. Although the "Serm?n" is parodie and its rules are ridden with contradiction and paradoxes, the author does isolate certain features that constitute a recognizable literary convention. According to the "Serm?n," these features are: the focus on the male lover's anguish, the inaccessibility of the female</page><page sequence="17">219 object of desire, and the association of the male lover's sensibility with spiritual refinement and strength. 3 Alan D. Deyermond cites the data that indicate the publishing success of San Pe dro's romance in his foreword to Carmen Parrillas edition of C?rcel de amor (31-33). 4 Terms "courtly love" or "fin ' amors," the latter preferred by the contemporary scholarship, refer to medieval amorous literature that considers a lover's quest for a lady's love, and his resultant suffering. While the earliest expressions of this literary tradition frequently represent a lover's advance through gradus amoris until his suffering finds consolation in sexual consummation (factum), later dolce stil nuovo and Petrarchan elaborations of the trend focus exclusively on unrequited love. It is the particular trend that values unrequited love in the aesthetics of courtly love literature that, in my judgment, informs C?rcel de amor, and that is therefore implied in the present analysis of San Pedro's work. 5 For the poetics of sentimentality in this group of texts, see E. Michael Gerli ("Toward"). The issues of sources, and of formal and thematic characteristics of the subgenre are addressed in Cortijo Oca?a (Evoluci?n), Deyermond ("Relaciones," "Ficci?n"), Gwara and Gerli, Rohland de Langbehn and Weissberger ("Gendered"). The contributions in the special issue of La Cor?nica 29.1 (2000): 3-229, and in the forum of La cor?nica 31.2 (2003): 239-319, contain important-contributions to the discussion of formal and thematic aspects of sentimental fiction. 6 Niklas Luhmann provides an interesting, although theoretically complex, discussion of the concept of love. Susan James and Thomas Dixon study the centrality of the concept of passion in premodern theories of human mind and affectivity, and its relation to contemporary theories of emotion. Whinnom (7-43) explains the implications of the premodern psychology of passions for San Pedro's best-selling work in his introduction to C?rcel de amor, while Elena Carrillo's take on the relationship of the concepts amor cort?s, fino amor, and amor hereos in medieval and early modern literature is evident from her conflation of the terms into "enfermedad cort?s de amor." 7 The phenomenon of representation of love as suffering and its relation to lovesickness (erotomania) has existed in Western culture since as early as classical antiquity and through the early modern period. Since I am focusing on a late fifteenth-century Spanish text, for the most part I will limit my remarks as referring to premodern period or the Middle Ages. 8 On the effects of passion on rational faculty, see Wack (90-98) and Cadden (138-41). 9 Irving Singer and Guillermo Ser?s study the history of representations and ideas on love from classical antiquity onwards. James Brundage examines the attitudes towards sexuality in medieval legal theories, while Pierre J. Payer focuses on the attitudes towards sexuality in medieval theological theories. For additional studies on erotomania or lovesickness, see Beecher and Ciavolella, Folger, Jacquart and Thomasset, Lacarra Lanz, McVaugh and Wack.</page><page sequence="18">220 i o Lacan's discussion of the concepts "subject" and "subjectivity" is contained in his second seminar. I am relying-principally on Silverman's clear and concise presentation of the same (Subject 126-31). 11 "I take it... that people's experience of subjectivity, of what it is to be a person, varies from culture to culture and over time... These experiences are subjectivity" (Reiss 8). 12 This "staging" of courtliness at the intersection of literary and courtly scene is exemplified in, and by, Baldassar Castiglione s II Cortegiano. 13 I draw on a variety of scholars who have theorized masochism - Deleiize, Mansfield, Noyes, Reik, Silverman (Male Subjectivity) and Zizek For lack of space, I cannot present a fully coherent theory of masochism assumed in this analysis. However, I test the steps that Zizek outlines in his study, and imply in the concept of "suffering subjectivity" a variety of features that Silverman distinguishes in Male Subjectivity (188-210) as moral, Christian, and feminine masochism. 14 Zizek's description of courtly love as a "social game" is reminiscent of Johan Huizinga's influential thesis regarding medieval courtly culture as a culture of play. 15 Mansfield explores the relationship of masochism and art, especially such art forms as literature and theatre. 16 I am interested in specifically heterosexual masochistic relationships. 17 Bruce Wardropper insists that C?rcel de amor is to be read as a vision ("Allegory" 42-44). Similarly, Sol Miguel-Prendes argues that "the framework of the 'prayer book mentality informs both C?rcel s readership and the work itself as a vision or meditation on the suffering of its protagonist, the noble Leriano" (12). She further adds that the protagonist's sufferings "are articulated in terms of a Passion of Christ and, like the Flemish paintings, depict visionary experience" (12). 18 Deyermond ("Hombre") studied the folkloric motif of desire allegorized as a wild man. 19 In chapter 38 of Don Quijote 2, the countess Trifaldi tells the story of princess An tonomasia, an heiress to the throne of the kingdom of Candaya. Princess Antono masia was beautiful, discreet, and numerous princes fell in love with her. Cervantes comments playfully on the literary convention that describes any princess in identi cal terms: all princesses - by antonomasia - are beautiful, discreet, and objects of desire. Such is Laureola, too. 20 The following is a sampling of judgments passed on Leriano and Laureola in some of the previous scholarship: Bruce Wardropper claims that "la fatal crueldad de Laureola se explica como consecuencia del conflicto amor cortesano-honor" (179). Frederick A. de Armas thinks that "en el autor encontramos entonces una cr?tica velada de Laureola, cr?tica que no puede hallarse en Leriano, ya que este funda todas sus observaciones en su Fe. Si Laureola ama, deber?a de regirse por tal sentimiento, como lo hace Leriano" ( 404-05). M?rquez Villanova deems that "Y la honra de Laureola, ya exacerbada e irracional... provoca el fin inexorable del amante" ("Historia" 148). Bruno Damiani develops an analysis that fully naturalizes</page><page sequence="19">221 Leriano's behavior as a noble stance in function of promoting Christian morality: "Leriano's life slowly comes to an end. And, in the spirit of the symbolic suffering which marked his life, Leriano embraces death, forgiving Laureola and still calling himself a 'bienaventurado' [fortunate]... for having been able to serve his lady" (40 41). Marina Scordilis Brownlee's comment contains a note of disapproval on Laureolas conduct as she remarks, "Meanwhile, despite the fact that Laureola has been vindicated, that her honor has been reinstated, she now refuses any contact with Leriano" (170). Anthony van Beysterveldt offers an alternative perspective as he discusses the stance of the female characters in Tractado de Arnalte y Lucenda and C?rcel de amor. "La resistencia que Lucenda y Laureola oponen a la pasi?n de sus amantes alcanza un car?cter heroico precisamente porque las doncellas van hasta el extremo de adoptar una actitud que se hab?a hecho harto odiosa en la ?poca: la de mostrarse crueles y desagradecidas, en vez de piadosas y compasivas, en el trato con sus pretendientes enamorados" (79). Patricia Grieve does not pass gender-typed judgment on the characters in her analysis of sentimental romances. 21 Some examples of medieval punitive technologies that constitute Leriano's masochistic fantasy derive from the actual practices of burning victims at stake, or the usage of different spiked torture instruments, such as "skull-splitter" or "rompecabezas:" "fitted around the head, the spikes, under the force of tightening screws, could pierce the bone" (Inquisition/Inquisici?n 64). Whether or not, as Wardropper argued ("Mundo" 176), Leriano represents a Christ figure due to the description of his crown with iron spikes ("una corona de unas puntas de hierro" [8]), the populace of medieval society would have had opportunity to witness this kind of torture. Finally, the halberd, a typical medieval weapon, was used extensively in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. It could be used to hook an enemy to the ground, take him off horseback, or it could be thrust or used for chopping. For evidence of gruesome imagination applied to the invention of torture instruments and techniques, see Inquisici?n/Inquisition. In his study of G?mez Manrique's poetry that contains references to disciplining practices, Jos? Mar?a Rodr?guez Garc?a comments: "Particularly relevant to my discussion of G?mez Manrique's poetry is the conflation of the sufferings involved in courtly love with the actual punishments administered by the appointed representatives of the Crown" (4). Rodr?guez Garcia's attention to the confluence of terms relevant to amorous poetry and punitive practices used under the Catholic Monarchs obviously supports my own analysis. 22 This is just a sampling of some twenty psychological faculties that San Pedro employs in this allegory. See C?rcel (8-11). 23 "Voyages, wanderings, quests, pilgrimages - spatial displacements - provide both subject matter and structural elements in many a medieval narrative. The space involved generally has a strong symbolic component. But one of the most curious</page><page sequence="20">222 uses of spatial imagery - especially of dichotomies between inside and outside, opened and closed - is to express structures of the self (Vitz 64). 24 "se-duco, ere"(lat.) - to lead aside, draw aside, lead away, carry off. 25 In reference to women who compromised their honour, the King declares, "Bien sab?is que establecen nuestras leyes que la muger que fuere acusada de tal pecado muera por ello" (47). 26 For the legacy of medieval scholastic tradition of university debates within sentimental romance, see Roffe s study 27 Eukene Lacarra Lanz proposed this reading of the passage in a seminar at the University of California at Berkeley in the Fall of 1997.1 thank her for the permission to use her interpretation of this passage, central to my argument, while awaiting her own publication on C?rcel de amor. 28 Pamela Waley offers similar thoughts with respect to this passage: "Laureolas last letter to Leriano bids him live and tells him what she will do to show her gratitude when her father is dead and the power will be hers ... As a lover owing unquestioning obedience to his Lady, Leriano falls hopelessly short in this. The death of a lover is no requisite of amour courtois, and his virtual suicide* the carrying out of a poetic threat often made but never implemented in the cancioneros, is in direct disobedience to Laureola's request" (262). 29 Peter Brooks (37-61) considers the role of desire as the motor of narrative. 30 Gerli offers a reading of C?rcel de amor that draws on Chorpenning's and Brownlee's studies of, respectively, the role of mythology and the nature of communication in San Pedro's work, in relation to Lacanian theories of the Symbolic, the Imaginary and the Real. Gerli contends that "Leriano's desire to secure the gap, to stabilize his sense of self through the use of linguistic representation and gain the subjective unity that could be bestowed upon him by Laureola's reciprocated words, fails and thereby constitutes a profound tragedy" (126). Gerli's conclusions clearly differ from those reached in the present analysis of the work. WORKS CITED BAKHTiN, mikhail m. "Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel."
