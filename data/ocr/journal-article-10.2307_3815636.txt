Printed in Uteded States of America 'As you desire me': Reading 'The Divine Garbo' through movement, silence and the sublime Melinda Szaloky Greta Garbo's shimmering, spellbinding screen image has often invited comparisons to the divine. In an early biography, John Bainbridge offers the following description of the star: Greta Garbo has been called 'The Divine' in several languages ... To some of her worship- pers she is only 'The Incomparable One', while to others she is simply 'poetry, sunrise and great music'. In England she has been char- acterised as 'a superhuman symbol of The Other Woman', and in Germany as 'the su- preme symbol of inscrutable tragedy'. Other European gallants, blowing hot and cold si- multaneously, have described her as 'the flam- ing icicle' and 'the frozen torch'. In America she has been hailed with majestic dizziness as 'the mysterious, inscrutable, available but un- touchable essence of the indefinable'.1 What hides behind this screen of grandilo- quence composed of superlatives and oxymora is in fact the incapacity of language to render the Garbo experience. Garbo's epithet 'The Divine' situates her on the border of the intelligible, in a class of her own. Paradoxically, this unique star persona would seem to demand definition on its own terms. What are the terms of 'Garboness'? This ques- tion may fly in the face of conventional wisdom con- cerning signification in general and the construction of the star image in particular. The star persona has been understood as a joint fabrication of the Holly- wood film industry and the affective responses of a viewing public. Inspired by Garbo's perfectly blank face in the final sequence of Queen Christina (1933), Marcia Landy and Amy Villarejo suggest that the star is a tabula rasa possessing no intrinsic value, only a culturally-assigned one.2 Yet, as Richard Dyer re- marks, Garbo's ability to 'do nothing' in the famous scene is, in itself, a considerable feat of perform- ance.3 Indeed, I will argue, it is primarily the uncanny pliability of Garbo's screen presence, her 'mercurial' acting style resonating with the intermittency of the moving image that constitutes 'The Divine Garbo' as a modern icon, an image without a likeness, a sub- lime beauty endlessly promising, endlessly eluding fulfillment. Perhaps the most powerful and most admired female star of the late silent studio era, Greta Garbo constitutes an intriguing subject both for feminist film scholarship and for a more general cultural historical inquiry targeting the vagaries of aesthetic appeal.4 Garbo's phenomenal screen presence has inspired a tradition of exegetes, whose efforts to come to terms with the star's magic have been instrumental Melinda Szaloky is a Ph.D. candidate in the Depart- ment of Film, Television, and Digital Media at the University of California, Los Angeles. Her dissertation explores the conceptual ties between the Kantian aesthetic and the European tradition of film theory, with a special focus on Deleuze's film philosophy.

In this essay, I will examine the key critical terms that have been applied to con- ceive 'the Divine Garbo', or, in my parlance, 'the Garbo affect'. I will show that 'the Garbo affect' can be (and has been) understood as an exceptional aesthetic occasion, an instance of photogenic 'ex- cess' and 'defamiliarization'. I will support my histori- cal study of the unique interplay between the film medium, Garbo's star acting, and her reception by insights gleaned from a broad critical spectrum, fea- turing, notably, Bela Balazs, Roland Barthes and Gilles Deleuze. There is much to be said about the peculiar interconnections between 'the Garbo affect', the moving image, and the modern event. 'The Garbo Affect': Movement, Photogenie and the Sublime Garbo suits films precisely, because her em- bodiment of transitions and continuity sustains the unfolding nature of the medium.5 Charles Affron Innumerable commentaries have paid tribute to Garbo's appearance on screen. What most critics emphasise and ponder, is the air of exoticism, ethereality and enigma surrounding her perform- ances. 'The Divine Garbo' is said to stand apart from other stars of the cinema. A fascinated, yet critically reserved, Roland Barthes suggests in an apparently Platonic vein that 'the essence of her corporeal per- son descended from a heaven where all things are formed and perfected in the clearest light'.6 Edgar Morin, in his turn, explains Garbo's divinity through her talent to combine the (allegedly) mutually exclu- sive female archetypes of seductress and ma- donna.7 Thomas Wiseman, too, spots two people in Garbo, a participant and an observer; someone who was at once 'enormously worldly' and yet curiously detached from the world, and who watched with amusement the impulsive side of her compound self.8 (Gilles Deleuze will identify this gesture of 'di- viding-in-two', this splitting into a detached observer and a mechanical actor, as the modern cogito, or split subject, as manifest in language, thought, and art.9) Raymond Daum admires Garbo's rare talent to 'simultaneously issue ... an invitation (come hither) and a warning (but not too close)' through her heavy eyelids.10 Charles Affron notes Garbo's special kinship with 'silence, the unsaid, the paradoxical, the am- biguous'. Affron sees the embodiment of the Garbo mystique in the star's performances of simultaneous 'withholding and yielding ... hiding and revealing'." Garbo's sliding into a car while seeming to pull away from it in Grand Hotel (1932) exemplifies this acting feat, and so does the 'two-faced' gesture through which Garbo seems to simultaneously push Armand away and grab for him in Camille (1937).12 This idiosyncratic 'turning towards-turning away' is on dis- play throughout A Woman of Affairs (1929) in the form of caresses that evoke absence and firm hand- shakes that convey disengagement.13 These are just a few of the many examples that suggest an intimate connection between 'the Garbo affect' and the star's performances of quick change, her tantalizing presence-absence, affirmation-nega- tion. Indeed, trying to capture a particular instance of 'the Garbo affect' in a still image can be a singularly unrewarding activity. The enigmatic smile redolent with contempt, pity, defiance and magnanimity that Garbo flashes at her fianc6's father in A Woman of Affairs looks hollowed out on a still. A similar flatness overtakes the image that tries to grasp the impercep- tible oscillation of devastating grief and (a put-up) carefree nonchalance that animates Garbo's face as she is waving goodbye to her departing lover in The Single Standard (1929).14 Consider also Richard Cor- liss's sensitive account of the last moments of Anna Karenina (1935): As the train under which she will soon throw herself passes by, light and dark alternate in quick flashes across Garbo's face. In the split second of shadow her face is young, beautiful and hopeful; in the split second of glare it is old and suicidally resolute. By some magic- lantern sleight-of hand, Anna's two warring states of mind are literally illuminated. It's one of the cinema's privileged moments: not a secret but a mystery, not an optical illusion but a visual miracle.15 Significantly, the rare aesthetic experience commemorated by Corliss is sparked by the per- fectly attuned interplay of Garbo's performance with the flicker of light and dark that 'founds' the film medium, a strange inverse interplay, harmony through disparity. The apparent phenomenological affinity between Garbo's mercurial performing style and the intermediary, interstitial moving image sug- gests that Garbo's special magic- 'the Garbo affect' - could be fruitfully explored through theories that have sought to explain the artistic appeal of cinema 197</page><page sequence="3">198 tfIlll .tl. . . ,C. ..........

Put differently, 'the Garbo affect' can be considered un- der the rubric of the 'medium specificity argument', whose lasting heuristic appeal (for continental film theory) has been keyed to a perceived parallelism between the paradoxical dual, or, rather, triangular, 'imaginary' logic of the moving image and prevalent models of the functional architecture of the mind.16 From its inception cinema has been hailed for its unmatched flair to simulate, and stimulate, the working of human consciousness, understood as a constant mediation between a dynamical, and im- perceptible, 'inner' (subjective) time of mental link- age, and a seemingly self-contained and well-delineable geometrical outer space-time of me- chanical objects. Considering that the Kant-inspired credo of modern art conceives the aesthetic as a sensible expression of the balance of this complex bipolar mind, it is hardly surprising that the moving image quickly came to be seen (again, in continental .:. E:: .::. :: :!:: .: =,: . =:!-.:'. : .. .. film aesthetics) as the materialization of the aesthetic function and, thus, the royal road to the core of the human condition. Despite gallant efforts to read into the incipient medium the makings of a traditional, classically-con- ceived form of art, cinema, a thoroughly modern artifice, became associated with the 'negative' pole of the Kantian aesthetic, the sublime. A significant afterthought (an 'appendage') to the pleasure, the beauty, of a newly-found 'transcendental' equilib- rium, the self-reflective sublime recognizes this new beauty - the meaning of subjectivity - as a chance upsurge of a puzzling (even uncanny) ever-enduring- ever-changing temporality bordering on the un- known.17 Although in Kant beauty and sublimity are two sides of the same coin, the sublime's shocking, devastating approach to the limit of the humanly sensible has appeared to best describe the modern (and post-modern) condition of spatio-temporal flow and the resulting fragmentation, alienation and de- centering of the human experience. It is in this sense, no doubt, that Jean-Fragois Lyotard calls the sublime 'the single aesthetic sensibility to characterize the 198 Melinda Szaloky</page><page sequence="4">'As you desire me': Reading 'The Divine Garbo' through movement, silence and the sublime Modern'.18 It is also in this respect that cinema can be (and has been) considered as the medium of a sublime aesthetic. It seems appropriate that Lyotard resorts to a cinematic metaphor to describe the sublime as a gesture that 'mediatizes ("dynamically speaking") the light with the dark [drawing] a clear space ... upon a dark contrast'.19 Further, film's gift to defamiliarize, that is, to suspend the automatic, habit-driven linkage of sen- sory material, has been overwhelmingly linked to the ability of cinema to 'make', and register, movement. This stance is typified by the early notion of pho- togenie, which refers instances of transcendence achieved through film to the incessant variation and displacement of the new medium. Cinema, Jean Epstein tells us, presents a 'choice within a choice, a reflection of a reflection'. This is a 'second genera- tion' of beauty (one 'twice distilled' and 'polarised like light'), offering up appearances 'embalmed in move- ment'.20 Photogenie is 'movement-image', as Deleuze will call the 'aesthetic consciousness' relayed through early modernist cinematic practices.21 Yet, as 'aesthetic consciousness', photogenie is equally the expression of a historically changing mind. True photogenie, in other words, entails not only an 'im- age' of constant change but also, and at the same time, a variation attuned to the sensibility of histori- cally-anchored (i.e. particularly changing) 'disinter- ested' observers. The 'negative presentation' of the sublime - which, Lyotard tells us, is 'neither the absence of presentation nor the presentation of noth- ingness' - may best convey this inseparably con- nected general and special relativity, this simultaneous 'turning towards-turning away' that in- forms photogenie as 'time-image' in the Deleuzean sense.22 I believe that Garbo's 'mercurial' acting style, her flair to stress, in Affron's words, the 'ands and buts' rather than the 'l-love-you-trulys', can be con- sidered as an example of the 'negative presentation' of a reality beholden to a dual reference, one in tune with, and manifest through, the interstitial mechanics of the moving image.23 I will argue that Garbo's photogenie - a term frequently evoked to describe the star's legendary 'love affair with the camera'24 - can be construed both as a vestige of an irreparable human lack and as a promise that there is something left behind as unattainable. It is true, as Roland Barthes notes, that Garbo emerges as a screen goddess at a time when 'cap- turing the human face still plunged audiences into the deepest ecstasy'.25 There is reason to believe that as a silent film icon, the Garbo visage may very well have functioned in the Benjaminian sense, as an 'ultimate retrenchment', a last refuge, for the aura, memorializing an ideal universally-shared humanity, a'mighty visual anthropomorphism', in Bela Balazs's words.26 Nevertheless, the enchantment of the 'Garbo affect' appears to be, rather, keyed to Garbo's knack at performing an imperceptible mo- ment of transmutation. In fact, Deleuze's reference to a primary 'con- tinuous gest' that con-fuses the caress and the slap, the embrace and the struggle, enacting the 'unde- cidability of the body' constitutes a fitting description of Garbo's antithetical body language as manifest in her 'two-faced' gestures.27 Remarkably, Deleuze's description of modern (i.e. post-World War II) cine- matic characters who inhabit their body 'like a zone of indiscernibility' might have been modeled on many a Garbo performance. In a similar vein, Parker Tyler Fig. 2.

A body bearing of undecidability: Garbo embraces final abandon in Camille. Fig. 4 (right). Delsarte redux: dispassionate abandon (with Robert Taylor) in Camille (1937). regards Garbo as a 'prodigious and likable zany' capable of assuming any form she likes (including, of course, amorphous forms of sexuality) without thereby ceasing to be Garbo. Clearly, for Tyler 'Gar- boness' is equivalent with endless metamorphosis28. It is worth noting that Garbo's 'crystalline' act- ing style owes a debt to the Delsarte method, a codification of the expressive mechanics of the hu- man body.29 The acknowledged impact of the Del- sartean semiotic of gestures on twentieth-century aesthetic practices (including Artaud's 'physical theater' and silent film acting) lends further support to my comparison of Garbo's (Delsarte-inspired) act- ing and the 'spiritual automaton' that Deleuze finds so compatible with the two-faced temporal mechan- ics of the film image.30 Garbo's flair to invest the clich6d poses with surprising new dimensions - as, for example, the signature backward tilt of the head conveying pas- sion denied in Camille, rather than Delsarte's idea of amorous abandon - has not been lost on critics. Cataloguing Garbo's irreverently repeated 'famous expressions', Christopher Isherwood bemoans the 'ridiculous artificiality' of her acting, which, however, is miraculously redeemed by her 'amazing beauty' and her 'naturally compelling and commanding' de- meanor.31 Parker Tyler, in his turn, admires Garbo's masterfully-trained deportment (equaled only by Chaplin in Hollywood), which he compares to calis- thenics.32 This is a special kind of calisthenics, Tyler adds, one developed by Garbo to de-emphasise her un-dainty, powerful and angular body without, how- ever, destroying its 'articularity'.33 Tyler's suggestion that the Garbo act achieves singularity through a pantomime of self-suppression reconfirms the affinity between 'the Garbo affect' and the sublime aesthetic of 'negative presentation'. Seen from this angle, it makes perfect sense that Garbo's being 'all movement' (as Louise Brooks notes) is always fraught with an air of languor.34 'From her first line, "I have never been so tired in my life"', Pauline Kael writes, 'Greta Garbo sets the movie [Grand Hotel] in vibration with her extraordinary pres- ence'.35 Peculiarly, Grand Hotel underscores Garbo's invigorating tiredness by her lengthy periods of retiredness from the screen. As Kael observes, it is Garbo's remarkably rarefied presence in the film that makes it a most appropriate vehicle for her, as well as a rare viewing experience.36 Through Garbo's notably absent presence - an absence running deeper than her intermittent withdrawals from the plot - this sound film appears to prompt us to read the tantalizing 'divine star' of the silents epitomised by Garbo as an instance of 'negative presentation'. (A similar idea is expressed by Richard Dyer, who claims that early stars were a 'negation' since they 200 Melinda Szaloky</page><page sequence="6">'As you desire me': Reading 'The Divine Garbo' through movement, silence and the sublime maintained the distinction' between the ideal and the status quo.37) The silence of the silents was obviously a significant factor in achieving an effect of 'negative presentation'. In what follows, I will explore this 'silent' aspect of 'the Garbo affect' in both her silent and sound films. 'The Garbo Affect': A Silent Voice She might have appeared in Les Chants de Maldoror, she might have satisfied Rimbaud ... When she spoke on the screen, we heard nothing; but her virtual voice seemed, some- how, to be a promise ... Hers was a silent voice.38 Philippe Soupault As noted earlier, integral to Garbo's mercurial pres- ence is an air of exhaustion, languor and contempla- tive stillness. Critics admire the 'unusual restraint in her expressions', her 'introspection, patience, and reflectiveness', all in all, her ability to wait and under- state.39 Garbo's minimalism appears as an anomaly in the silent cinema, which tended to compensate for the absence of the speaking voice through an inten- sified, 'telegraphing' body language.40 Garbo's 'si- lent acting' in a silent medium - like a painting using white on white - again underscores her intuitive un- derstanding and exploitation, of the specific qualities of film that were believed to make it a vehicle for modern art.41 Early film aesthetes regarded the silence of the medium as a unique opportunity for representing the world in an indirect, unexpected and insightfully un- familiar way. The heightened metaphysical sensitivity attributed to silent film was most often connected to film's talent to bring close and explore the human face. The 'silent soliloquy' of the face, Balazs notes, 'can tell us things for which we have no words', as well as convey quick shifts of moods that words are too sluggish to follow. Balazs finds in the "'poly- phonic" play' of facial features - described as the simultaneous appearance of a variety of contradic- tory relations - an 'adequate expression of the mul- tiplicity of the human soul'. It is this invisible mental dimension that the close-up makes manifest by ex- ploring the face, the privileged medium of the 'inner voice'.42 Few would question the supremacy of the Garbo visage in the silent cinema of 'made-up faces'.43 Hordes of critics have paid tribute to the rare photogenic quality of this face, seeking to explain its great attraction through the unique structure of its bones, the fine texture of the skin, the luxurious eyelashes, or the 'rather masculine' severity and dignity of the profile.44 Equally noted is the uncanny ability of Garbo's face to register 'varying degrees of self-consciousness' in 'the shortest interval of time, without a trace of discomposure'.45 William Daniels, whose camera most often rendered Garbo's face on the screen, describes his repeated efforts 'to make the camera peer into her eyes, to see what was there'.46 The evidence of Clarence Brown, the direc- tor of seven Garbo films, further supports the idea that Garbo's performing style taps into, and evokes, a virtual spiritual dimension: Garbo had something behind the eyes that you couldn't see until you photographed it in close-up. You could see thought. If she had to look at one person with jealousy, and another with love, she didn't have to change her ex- Fig. 5.

Garbo the seer: a visionary frontal gaze in A Woman of Affairs. pression. You could see it in her eyes as she looked from one to the other.47 Prompted, perhaps, by the 'faintly tremulous wounds' and 'strange soft flesh' of Garbo's 'not in the least expressive' eyes, Barthes classifies the Garbo face as a 'fragile moment' of 'transition' be- tween an 'essential' and an 'existential' beauty.48 There are, furthermore, indications that this transi- tional Garbo look may be related to the Deleuzean 'seer', the visionary character type of post-World War II European cinema, whose clairvoyant gaze traces 'the gushing of time as dividing in two, splitting'.49 There are many critical sightings of Garbo the 'time-seer'. Richard Corliss calls her a 'superior woman whose eyes saw and discounted everything in advance'. Isabel Quigley notes her 'ageless face' and 'inner look that suggested it might be [a] 1000 [years old]'.50 For Cecilia Ager, Garbo 'sees not only her own life, but everybody else's, before it has been lived'. Besides, she keeps casting a clairvoyant look backwards 'like a perpetually drowning woman'.5' The list is topped by Affron's claim that Garbo - whose sight 'is unhindered by closed lids' - makes films 'a contemplative art' prefiguring 'Ingmar Bergman's Persona or Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Awentura'.52 Seeking to de-romaticise the clairvoy- ant Garbo look, Landy and Villarejo point to Garbo's penchant to cast frontal glances instead of directly looking at other characters, or objects. This gives the impression that she is looking beyond or through them, which lends her gaze an air of remoteness.53 Deleuze's psychic 'seer' - one 'who finds himself [and herself] struck by something intolerable in the world, and confronted by something unthink- able in thought' - is a sublime medium whose insight is offered up to the film viewer.54 The viewer who shares this insight is, however, in addition biased by the 'perspective' of her or his own historical situation. Bela Balazs, for example, reads into Garbo's 'brood- ing glance' - which 'comes from afar' and 'looks into an endless distance' - a boundless longing for an elsewhere, away from the 'unclean' world of the present day. For Balazs, Garbo possesses a 'strange sort of beauty', which bears the stamp of suffering, loneliness and estrangement. Behind the variety of 202 Melinda Szaloky _.. .... .*:::.::..

The Surrealist Philippe Soupault's panegyric to Garbo's 'silent voice' testifies to Garbo's great appeal also for an irreverent, but not less Romantic, avant-garde sensi- bility.62 Moreover, as Walter Benjamin warns, the age of mechanical reproduction is not content with intro- ducing a new ideal of beauty, reflecting the strange- ness, shock, speed and distraction of the times.63 Through cinema, a mass art takes shape, whose premier object d'art, Durgnat and Kobal tell us, is the film star.64 As a Hollywood star, Garbo is certainly a commodity, mass-produced for mass-consumption. Yet, as an avatar of the strange beauty of the modern age, the Garbo image bears witness to a palpable modernist sensitivity in 'silent' Hollywood.65 Indeed, Lucy Fischer argues, the modernist predilection for abstraction, distortion and artificiality as manifest in Art Deco (the prevalent design style of Fig. 7. The suffering of irreparable lack (A Woman of Affairs). the early twentieth century, known as modernism or style modere) is wholeheartedly embraced and emulated by Hollywood in the late 1920s and early 1930s, 'a period of perilous social, artistic, and eco- nomic change'.66 In Fischer's view, Garbo's modern- ist border-crossings - her subversion of, what Affron calls, 'conventional perceptions of space, body, sexuality, voice' - exemplify this Hollywood modern- ism, although, Fischer admits with a puzzled air, 'modernism seems not only to affix to Garbo in [her silent] films but also to emanate from her'.67 It is quite telling that Garbo's most frequent professional associates were a cinematographer (William Daniels), a set-designer (Cedric Gibbons), and a costume-designer (Adrian), rather than a prominent director or writer.68 In fact, the meager, pitiably clich6d plots of a typical Garbo melodrama appear to be a mere excuse, at best a catalyst, for a sublime encounter between screen divinity (as spiri- tual medium) and its rapt audience. The preoccupa- tion of Garbo, and her studio, with the 'Garbo look' can be read as a manifestation of early Hollywood modernism, which, Fischer notes, assigns perform- ance (that of the star) and mise-en-scene a signifi- cant 'dramatic' role.69 Garbo's obsessive off-screen reclusiveness, her 'non-personhood', adds the fin- ishing touch to the illusion of the self-animating, self-sustaining Garbo image, an ideal act of signifi- _ _ tfF i ltTllf . tiL f . .~ .- - : {2C.# . . . . . .....

" ..... . cation possessing a virtual referent rather than a physical 'original'.70 So great is the urge to throw Garbo's face in relief that effects of the mise-en-sc6ne are routinely enlisted to supplement the camera's efforts. Affron calls attention to a visual motif that systematically recurs in Garbo's films (including her sound films): the framing and accentuation of Garbo's glowing face against the dark contour of a lover's shoulder, neck and back of the head.71 Apparently, Garbo's screen lovers function mostly as a graphic framing device for 'the Face', rather than as addressees of the otherworldly passion radiated by 'the Face'. In this respect, Garbo's men join the ranks of objects that have served to frame love on her face: for exam- ple, a bouquet of roses, a pillow, a telephone receiver and, not least, effects of her flamboyant costumes.72 Indeed, Adrian's creations for Garbo often play the role of a close-up mechanism by 'severing' her head from the rest of her body through a stiff white collar, by enhancing her face through a stunning head- dress, or by draping her body in innumerable layers of silk or velvet until it loses its materiality allowing the face to shine forth and live a life of its own.73 Remarkably, Garbo's 'silent voice' - her ability to intimate what lies between, or beyond, conven- tions and discrete forms of expression - is not re- stricted to her career in silents but carries over to her sound films. Garbo's transition to sound was not simply a matter of the star's capacity to speak Eng- lish (being a foreign actress), nor whether she could muster a physical voice to match her 'virtual' one. The question was, rather, whether the new taste for psy- chological realism, whetted by synchronised sound, could stomach 'the Divine One' at all. In addition, the onset of the Great Depression halted the modernistic excess of the 1920s (manifest in the androgynous, assertive, non-maternal 'new woman' embodied by Garbo), creating a need for entertainment affirming the middle-class status quo.74 It is no coincidence that in her first sound role (Anna Christie, 1930), Garbo portrays the tribulations, and eventual re- demption, of a down-and-out streetwalker against a grimly realistic social setting. We know that Garbo made the transition, tak- ing a piece of the silents with her to the talkies. In Corliss's apt words, Garbo - who learnt her trade in the silent cinema and still remembered her lessons in the early sound period - was 'a beautiful dinosaur, an Olympian remnant surviving into the Plastic Age'.75 No doubt, Garbo's deep, husky voice (char- acterised as a 'Swedish foghorn') and 'exotic' foreign accent possessed an im/materiality, a 'graininess', to paraphrase Barthes, that called attention to itself, depleting the narrative significance of her speeches.76 Yet, not even Garbo was immune to the talkies' iconoclasm. There is reason to believe that the star's conversion from the 'certified Sex Goddess' of her early films to 'the Divine Masochist' of her sound career might only partly be ascribed to the Depres- sion and the efforts of the Hayes Office. What Corliss describes as Garbo's gradual discarding of the physical for the metaphysical could well have been an attempt to safeguard the 'silent voice' threatened by the matter-of-factness of verbal utterances.77 The unmatched eloquence of the blank face, the su- premely artificial tabula rasa mask, at the end of Queen Christina and the 'ravishing tranquillity' of the death scene in Camille have been ranked among the most ethereal moments of the cinema.78 Parallel to this, however, there is a noticeable Fig. 8. Framing the Face- tracing the limits of the frame (Anna Karenina). 204 Melinda Szaloky</page><page sequence="10">'As you desire me': Reading 'The Divine Garbo' through movement, silence and the sublime tendency in Garbo's sound films to grow self-reflec- tive, to offer quotations of the 'silent screen goddess' that Garbo uniquely typified. When speaking of chronic fatigue, of being desperate on account of love, of wanting to be left alone, of dying as a bache- lor, the Garbo characters of the talkies foreground the barely perceptible difference between them- selves and (1) the 'The Divine Garbo' of the silents, as well as (2) the legend of the 'private' Garbo - anticipating a new kind of cinematic modernism, that of the 'time-image'.79 It may be more than a coincidence that the most poignant examples of Garbo's famed androg- yny can be found in her sound films (e.g. Anna Christie, Queen Christina and Ninotchka [1939]). Foregrounding Garbo's ambiguous sexuality could have served as a strategy to offset the reality effect of her speeches, which threatened to 'emasculate' her 'silent voice'. Christina's 'disrobing' for Don An- tonio in Queen Christina marks the peak of Garbo's gender bending (and blending). Affron describes Garbo hovering 'in that area between male and fe- male, leaning into her identity as woman, to be sure, but not abandoning the richness of her compound being'.80 As always, Adrian's costumes are instru- mental in shaping the 'Garbo image'. According to Jane Gaines, in Queen Christina 'Adrian's design fashions the full erotic continuum for Garbo' from 'conventional' heterosexuality through drag to 'asex- ual ethereality'.81 Landy and Villarejo dwell on Garbo's last outfit in the film which 'appears to be a feminine version of her earlier masculine attire'. The ambiguity of the garment seems to situate Garbo 'in a place between masculine and feminine, homo- sexuality and heterosexuality, symbol and mortal, public and private person'.82 Ultimately, Garbo's performances of the 'Grande Dame' did not agree with the American public's increasing taste for human-sized heroes, earthly passions and happy endings, although, as Durgnat and Kobal note, 'the new [Garbo] image appealed more to women than men'. While a woman critic discovers a new 'warmth' in Camille, a male critic bemoans the 'curious frigidity that Garbo devel- oped in her style'.83 Perhaps Garbo's self-abstraction (most evident in Camille, which she undertook after a long illness that led to significant weight loss) posed a threat to the fetish value of her image. If so, the anguished reaction of male viewers - and the sympathetic response of female ones - should come as no surprise. MGM's attempt to 'Americanise' Garbo in Two-Faced Woman (1941), however, met with a pub- lic and critical outrage, prompting the star's self-im- posed retirement from the screen. 'Your stock in trade is mystery. We don't do that any more. Frank- ness is our motto', Constance Bennett delivers the verdict to Garbo in the film. Yet, the disrobing of 'The Divine Garbo' - through a plot twist that slashes the mysterious composite of 'Garbo' into the cliched roles of seductress and madonna - proved to be a gesture of frankness that impressed spectators as sacrilege. Critics spoke of the film's vandalism, com- paring Two-Faced Woman to the shock of seeing one's own mother drunk.84 Garbo's 'tasteless' dou- bling (or splitting) into antithetical twin sisters not only undermined the myth of her uniqueness, but also threatened the belief in the make-belief of cinema that Garbo came to epitomise. Little wonder that the spectacle of a split Garbo's oscillation between her distinct yet interchangeable selves against the back- ground of 'Garboness' (a time-image avant la lettre) proved a shattering experience for a public deeply invested in the idea(l) of transcendence - cloaked in the ethos of upward mobility, and projected through classical narrative cinema. Envoi In one of her early sound films, Garbo plays a cabaret singer suffering from amnesia, who may or may not be the long-lost wife of an Italian count. Moved by the man's longing, Garbo decides to assume the wife's identity, in spite of her own doubts. 'Would you help me to create her again?' she entreats him contem- plating the wife's ethereal portrait. 'You can only do it by believing me. Then perhaps I can be as you desire me.' The film, properly titled As You Desire Me (1932), showcases the leitmotif of 'Garboness', ex- uding presence-absence, multiplicity, and the beck- oning of a splendidly impossible promise. Matching to a marvel the physicality of the moving image, Garbo's mercurial - photogenic, even 'crystalline' - acting style and eloquent, polyphonic silences have constituted this star as the incarnation of the transit mentality of her age. 'The Divine Garbo' responds both to nostalgic yearnings for (waning) human tran- scendence, and to futurist, but still human-centered aspirations. Besides, as a 'modern star', Garbo is also 'out of her time', as Durgnat and Kobal remark. For these authors, Garbo is 'the only star in the Anglo-Saxon cinema to satisfy the rhapsodic ideal- 205</page><page sequence="11">206........................................................................ MeInda S Ia IIllI I ..I ism of her time and the inquisitive realism of ours'- the new realism of the 'time-image', I may add.85 Perhaps, as Affron has suggested, Garbo would indeed have made a fitting heroine for Bergman and Antonioni, masters of Deleuze's time-image cinema. Parker Tyler was right: thinking of Garbo does take one 'to the celebration of the might-have-been'.86 Acknowledgements: I would like to thank Amelie Hastie, Shelley Stamp and Richard Koszarski, as well as Edward Branigan, Janet Bergstrom, John Kurten, Charles Wolfe and Peter Wollen for their generous assistance in shap- ing this essay.

Abstract: 'As you desire me': Reading 'The Divine Garbo' through move- ment, silence and the sublime, by M lnda Szaloky Through her reading of Greta Garbo's star persona, the author interrogates the dominant theoretical paradigms that have been used to characterize female figures of the period, suggestively arguing how Garbo's ambiguity challenges these models. 208</page></plain_text>
