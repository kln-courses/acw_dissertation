THE MASKS OF LIBERIA Appreciating a Heritage African Art Museum of the S.M.A. Fathers Tenafly, New Jersey April 24-June 1, 1988 Despite their visibility in collections, exhibitions focusing solely on the masks of Liberia and con- tiguous areas have been rare, which is surpris- ing considering the variety of forms produced. The African Art Museum of the S.M.A. Fathers attempted to fill the void, not only by offering an exhibition of nearly eighty masks of high quality, but also by publishing a catalogue to provide permanent documentation of the objects. Installed with the assistance of Leonard Kahan, the display utilized the central rotunda of the museum to present five masks in full costume. Surrounding glass cases housed the remaining examples, arranged according to form: anthropomorphic, helmet, zoomorphic, grotesque, deformity, miniature, and fabric/ fiber. Since attribution by ethnic group is exceedingly difficult, this classification provid- ed a convenient means of assembling similar masks so that their forms could be appreciated. The anthropomorphic masks included some fine examples of the Dan deangle and tankagle, although, as William Siegmann has indicated, it is virtually impossible to tell them apart without the komo or keson attachments. Among the most important pieces were three Bassa nah-wede masks, two of them shown with costume. While the literature refers to these as "country devils," the refined and composed visages reminded us that these forms represent family or personal spirits that may assist and entertain humans. The cherubic-faced nah-wede from the collection of Dr. Michael Berger, featured on the catalogue's cover, was an accomplished, balanced carving that epi- tomized the mastery of this form. A fine Loma bakarogi from the collection of Edward J. Biggane, seen in full costume, revealed a more cubistic interpretation, its face sharply divided by angular planes. Nearly one-quarter of the objects were helmet masks. While often attributed simply to the Mende, these masks are ubiquitous in western Liberia among the Vai, Kono, Gola, Dei, Bassa, Loma, Kpelle, and Gbandi. Filling two cases, NAH-WEDE MASK. BASSA, LIBERIA. DR. MICHAEL BERGER COLLECTION. many still with their original attachments of black raffia, the soweimasks of the Sande society were like classical busts of ancient emperors, each with its own dignified presence. One of the most interesting was from the collection of Lincoln Turner: both of its Janus faces were precisely geometrical and richly patinated. While not many zoomorphic works were presented, those displayed demonstrated a diversity of form. Among the kagle masks, a geayagle from the collection of Jim and Marjorie Wilson was most impressive. Kagle are mischievous spirits exhibiting uncivilized behavior; the Wilson mask, however, seemed serene and gentle, projecting a "coolness" that might contradict its original function. A Kpelle beaked bird mask from the S.M.A. collection was imposing in its elaborate costume of cowries, fur, and leopard skin. The grotesque masks, incorporating such elements as clay, blood, animal teeth, and power pouches, presented a challenging aesthetic. Violating our sense of decorum and balance, they thrust us into a maelstrom of violent and awesome spirits and rendered tangible the turbulent aspects of life. The We mask of Marshall Ward Mount was an exciting highlight of the exhibition. With the perimeter of its bulbous face tightly packed with medicine bags, its full, flowing mane and raffia beard, and its deep-set, tubular eyes, this work expressed the force of a classical Greek tragedy. A second We example, from the collection of Leonard and Judith Kahan, bristled with potential power with its shotgun-shell beard. These masks offered an important glimpse into the cultures of the peoples of Liberia. Western influences will certainly continue to play a large part in the evolution of these tradi- tional forms. For now, we can look to these images as reflections of an age that is slowly receding into history. The museum hopes that this will be the first in a series of exhibitions that will contribute to the appreciation of African art. The catalogue (36 pp., 40 b/w photos) is available from the African Art Museum of the S.M.A. Fathers, 23 Bliss Avenue, Tenafly, NJ 07670. $5.95 postpaid.
