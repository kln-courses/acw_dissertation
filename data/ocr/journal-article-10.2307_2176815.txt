<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN INTERPRETATION OF SOME ASPECTS OF THE SELF. SPECULATIVE interest in the group of problems which center about the self concept without doubt remains, but the direction of that interest has changed somewhat in recent years. Many now base their solutions upon biology or psychology, at times pushing the enquiry through the organic into the inorganic and elemental, finding even in the atom the beginnings of indi- viduality. The appeal to metaphysic is less frequent. This is perhaps due to the well-grounded conviction that its attitude toward this as toward other problems was radically wrong in the past, and that it has still to change much before speculative interest can claim the serious attention which concrete genetic theories pos- sess. In what follows we first may notice briefly some reasons for this change of attitude, and then turn to some familiar psy- chological aspects of the self, from which we may gather sugges- tions regarding a possible view of its ultimate or real nature. The self is admittedly in some sense a fact of experience. Now any experiential fact or datum presents two aspects. It has, to use a biological analogy, both structure and function. Structurally it is a complex of elements, functionally the complex is a unit, subserving some end or purpose in a system of which it is taken to form a part. We may similarly regard the self. If we attempt to discover its unity in structure, i. e., in psychological composition, we are forced to find it in function; if we look for unity in function or meaning, we are inevitably thrust back upon structure or compo- sition. Ethical and metaphysical theories of the self have been chiefly concerned with the functional aspect of the problem. But the need of making the functional view definite and picturable by reference to structure thrust conceptions of unity, perma- nence, and substantiality into the foreground. Such views were found insufficient, because there was no adequate structural or descriptive account of the self. When this was supplied, the sen-</page><page sequence="2">INTERPRETATION OF SELF I 7 sation-complex superseded spiritual activity and unity; introspec- tion could no longer point to a particular experience in support of the reality of the self. And now, so far as structural evidence goes, we know of no ego except that which arises from the co6r- dination of the nerve-cells. Psychology thus contributes negatively to the problem; for since the self can no longer be regarded as an entity behind ex- perience, it must be sought in experience, in the functional and structural features of those experiences which we term the em- pirical selves. I. Some Dualistic Assumptions. -The view to which one is then brought from a study of the psychology of the self is this. It is nothing fixed or permanent. It denotes now this and now that ideational or perceptional complex. The self, in short, is a ' thing'; like the thing, it is a process, but, unlike the thing, it is distinguished by us as ' inner,' not ' external.' It is a name given to this or that nexus of experiences all of which have this pecu- liarity in common, that whatever nexus of experiences the indi- vidual terms himself is somehow vastly different from any other grouping of experiences. These other groups constitute external objects, and also, in analogy with the first group of experiences, other selves. It is true that the difference between this first group of experiences and all these other groups, i. e., between self and not-self, seems for common sense to be an absolute dif- ference, and this distinction has been further emphasized by meta- physical reflection, which has imported into certain of these groups the conception of matter and into other groups the notion of a self behind the phenomenal states of consciousness. But, apart from these prepossessions, what the individual terms self is simply a variable group of experiences distinguishable from others. Ordinarily, it is true, we look upon our consciousness as some- thing which is separated metaphysically, or perhaps spatially, from things, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, from other consciousnesses. It is so much plaster overlaying the cortex of a man's cerebrum. But we do not regard our physical relation to external objects in the same way. These external processes are continuous with those which occur in the physical organism;</page><page sequence="3">i8 THE PJILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XII. motions of the air are continuous with molar and molecular vi- brations in the ear; movements of the ether are continuous with chemical and neural processes in the organ of vision; physical environment is one with the physical man. But it is also true that a man's individuality, finitude, limitation, etc., characteristics which mark his 'self,' as well as that ordinary and insistent separation between two realms of experience, outer and inner, are distinctions, immediate and inevitable though they may be, within an experience which for convenience we may term the experience of the moment, although the temporal is in truth itself a distinc- tion within this experience. Self and external objects are alike abstractions from it, terms denoting special groupings which ap- pear within it, and, as I hope to show later, significant phases of this experience. It was said above that certain of these groups of experiences constitute external objects. One such object is, let us say, a book. It is an aggregate of leaves and cloth, pasteboard and ink. This is to regard it in terms of those particular groups of experiences within which any physical object falls. As an object of individual perception, however, the book is a percept, resolv- able into groups of peripherally aroused sensations supplemented by re-aroused sensations of central origin. This is to interpret the book in terms of a second class of experiences now properly termed ' subjective.' But, in the third place, the book has, beside these structural aspects, what we may again term a functional value; it occupies a special place among all groups of experiences to which it stands in specific relations, and it has a meaning and reality which is in part determined by the fact that there are other books, other objects, other groups of experiences to which it is related and among which it has a unique place and significance. Now, if our description of the book as an aggregate of external parts (class I) is to be real, it can be real only as these other groups of experiences (II and III) are taken to constitute the unitary thing we call ' book.' Similarly, if we choose to describe it in terms of psychological structure (class II), its unity must be found outside of these psychical groups (sensations) in those classes of experiences (I and III) which fall outside the system of which the thing is taken to be a part.</page><page sequence="4">No. i.] INATERPRETA TION OF SELF. I9 In summary, we are to find a least common denominator and regard things as simply experiences (and to this question we shall turn presently); the ' thing' which we describe has a name which denotes the various uses in which it is employed as func- tionally representative of other groups of experiences, actual or possible, actual experiences being those which must be referred to my self-group, possible experiences those which must be re- ferred to other groups. When we describe a thing, we substitute a second and new group for the first; but this structural account is really a description only as we admit also its functional sig- nificance or representative value. For we cannot describe a thing in terms of one set of relations, unless we assume that it is just so far real in the other relations in which the thing stands to us as our description is real. Our description of the book in terms of leaves, cover, and printer's ink does not detract from its reality as a unique object of external perception. Similarly, if our psy- chological disintegration of the self into sensation-complexes is to be a real account, the self which is thus described must, in some sense, be real and unitary. As seriously as you take de- scription, so seriously must you take the unity of the thing de- scribed. The unity of the thing is no more, no less, genuine than the unity of the system of which it is taken to be a part. Dis- carding, then, as empirical psychology insists that we must, the assumption of a self behind experience, we have to start with the empirical selves only, various groups of experiences having certain characteristics in common like other psychical experiences,-emo- tions, for example. Wherever self is opposed to object, it is simply an opposition of one 'inner' group of experiences, for practical reasons termed ' mine,' to another, and the experience within which the distinction occurs is as much other-than-mine as mine, as much not-self as self. In short, we shall view the self as any other empirical thing; like the thing, it is unique and unitary; it possesses a function which is inseparable from struc- ture. The question is: Does the self possess a unique function in the interpretation of experience as a whole ? II. The Nature of the Oblect- Consciozusness. -We have noticed the sharp separation which we ordinarily make between self and</page><page sequence="5">20 TEE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XII. not-self, consciousness and object of consciousness. We think of consciousness and things, but our experience is as truly a consciousness-of-things. External object, we say, is just what consciousness is not. And it is true that metaphysics cannot unite satisfactorily in an abstract monism things which are by nature heterogeneous. But metaphysics deals with types, not substances, real aspects or recurrent phases of experience, not entities, and its task is not to ontologize, but rather to discover those universal aspects or types which things in their likenesses and differences display. When, on the other hand, the self is taken in isolation from the context of experience in which it is found, the fiber of that experience is cut, and it matters little whether the instrument employed in this vivisectional process is the psychological or, as in Mr. Bradley's hands, for example, the logical scalpel, for the issue of the experiment is the same. The ' flux and flow' to which other things are subject affects the self likewise, when taken in its structural aspect alone. But the previous argument has intended to show that, if we are content with the psychological account, self is but one group of experi- ences among others; consciousness is also a term applied to experiences in a certain aspect, and as such falls within a given body of fact which we have termed a ' given experi- ence.' And this experience is an object-consciousness, for we have no a priori right to assume that it is not the same for all individuals,' since the self of any given individual falls within such an experience. What Nature is for the natural scientist, that is, something which is one and homogeneous, and therefore capable of being exploited, this given experience must be for metaphysic, if it is to concern itself with the ultimate significance of this illusory term ' self.' In short, we are at any moment con- fronted by a 'given experience,'2 a consciousness-of-things, an X, or unknown,3 but not an Unknowable, within which all dis- tinctions fall, and this is, in one real aspect, as said above, not- mine as well as mine, object as much as subject.

Then, indeed, it becomes true that " the mind [as this particular group of experiences and, by analogy, all 'inner experiences'] is absolutely confined within its nerve-exchange; beyond the walls of sense-impression it can logically infer nothing."' But, on the showing of psychology, we know absolutely nothing of mind in itself or of consciousness as such, and are dealing simply with groups of experiences, having this in common that they are ' inner experiences.' ' Animal' is not only a general but a collective term, signifying classes of organisms which have various structural and functional peculiari- ties in common. 'Consciousness' is such a term, and the various groups of processes included within it are so many individual groups which psychology studies inductively. We have ' mem- ories,' says Ribot, not a faculty of memory; we have ' selves,' is the psychological account, not a spiritual ego. Similarly, we have ' consciousnesses,' not a consciousness. But the metaphysic of psychology substitutes a transcendental ' consciousness' for a transcendental ego, and, going beyond the safe and workable assumption that all communication between the individual and the outside world is through the channels of the senses, it affixes consciousness at one end of a series of conditions, the other end of which is the outer world, and the intermediate conditions of which are the stimulus, nerve-excitation, and brain-process. Thus it virtually transforms condition into cause, and localizes coin- sciousness as surely as if the latter had been placed in the pineal gland or in home other organ. If, however, we must discard a metaphysical ' consciousness' along with a metaphysical ' self,' we are concerned in psychology only with conscious or inner groups of experience which we view structurally in terms of sen- sations, while these same experiences may have a fuctional as well as a structural value outside the particular groups of nervous processes with which they are psychologically in correlation. Consciousness does not hover about nerve cells like the halo about the head of a medieval saint. It is merely a term given to experiences, taken in a certain aspect. 1 Karl Pearson: The Grammar of Science, i900, p. xo8.</page><page sequence="7">22 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW LVOL. XII. We have adopted a given experience or object-consciousness as a provisional reality, and beyond it we cannot go to anything more real than itself. We have now to see what is involved in the acceptance of this object-consciousness as a datum for inves- tigation. (i) It is concrete and not a mere abstraction; for any fact or object to which the individual turns is distinguished within this experience. A thing is individual and unique only because an experience which is more than itself is made the subject of analysis. (2) This ' given experience' is also unitary, although only as any empirical thing is unitary. An aggregate cannot be analyzed. One may analyze the character of an indi- vidual or a nation, but not an aggregate of processes which make up the individual, or of individuals who make up the nation. Hence this larger experience must also be unitary, for methodo- logical purposes, in spite of the differences which arise within it. And (3) if we try to grasp this given experience as a whole or in part, it always results in being objective. In the following section of this paper, we shall therefore be concerned with this aspect of difference with which emerges our concept of the self. III. Segregation and Analysis. -Whether we turn to I inner' or ' outer' experience, objectivity emerges as the common char- acteristic of anything which is accepted as a datum. As a second aspect, then, this given experience of the moment is always limited, fixed as some special group of processes and made static as a unique and unitary object, whether of the external world or of the inner life. And, as such, it is opposed tp this given experience or object-consciousness, which then becomes other- than-object, or subject. We must then admit the paradoxical nature of experience. It is at any moment unitary, yet the dis- tinction of subject and object is real, not merely phenomenal. For if it is true that the recognition of anything as an object depends upon the fact that an experience which is more than the object is taken to be real, to deny the reality of the opposition between subject and object would mean to deny the reality of the given experience through reference to which the object is</page><page sequence="8">No. i.] INTERPRETA TION OF SELF. 23 known.' In other terms, real difference is possible only through real relationship, which means also real unity. We conclude, then, that this antithesis is so far real as our given experience is real. The opposition expresses a fixed relation, or, as Mr. Lloyd Morgan has it, experience is polarized2 as subject and object. This is something like the realistic attitude of the ordinary con- sciousness; but the opposition does not lie between ' inner ' states and ' external' things, since the subjective self means simply any associational complex, temporarily regarded as a view-point for the object, while the latter is indifferently thing in the outer world and content of my consciousness. This may be granted, but it may still be said: the book as an external presentation is totally different from the internal pres- entation -the memory-image of the book. The reply is: undoubtedly, for the external book is, in its physical character, (i) a group of experiences which cannot be referred to my self- group, (2) a group which (from the psychological aspect) can be so referred, since it is reducible to specific classes of sensations in correlation with the bodily organism. Moreover, (3) it has a functional value, which differs from that of the memory- or fancy- image, and so on in still other relations. Experience, then, in so far as it is objective in the sense of pres- entational, is homogeneous. Perceptions, thoughts, feelings, in a word, what the individual must ascribe to himself, are, in pro- portion to their definiteness, limitation, and employment as pres- entational data for the attachment of relations, in a real sense objects. If they are not, it is difficult to see what psychology really means by correlating these two realms of experience, interpreting one in terms of the other. And similarly, if ideas are in the above sense things, the latter are, in virtue of their being experiences, subjective as well as objective. But here the homogeneity of ' external' and ' internal ' is apparently contradicted, and the difficulty is that thoughts are not 1 Common sense argues unreflectively but well, that ' object in the outer world is wholly independent of myself, for I trust my total experience of the moment.' It concludes to real difference on the basis of a tacitly acknowleged relationship between subject and object. 2 Cf.

If, however, experience is homogeneous as above, an admission must be made on our part. Space is neither a mind- independent entity nor, as Kant said, a form of external per- ception only. It is a form in which we envisage all our conscious contents; more than this, a principle or function which defines and characterizes all experience, a form of thought as well as a form of reality. For anything which is taken to be an object, although structurally an aggregate, is first of all in the act of attention transfixed, limited, made static and presentational, and thus defined for practical use as an object. Space, in other words, is not a barrier between a world of external objects and an inner world of conscious processes; for the latter, as the psychology of space is a witness, are capable of being defined through the mechanism of association as a spatial world. Particular images may be auditory, visual, or tactual; but all are spatial as defined and static portions of presentational experience. So, too, are concepts which are, from the structural point of view, generalized images. The concept is in one aspect "an assumed limit" of inner presentational contents, "assumed for practical purposes by the will,"1 and as such functionally active in the judgment. Ac- cordingly the suggestion is here made that the above analytic and defining process, which appears in this fixation of presentational content as static and objective, is the first of the processes involved in that psychological mechanism by which, through association of this presentational content with specific classes of sensations, a world of 'inner' processes is gradually transformed into an outer and definite world of spatial objects and space relations. And when we say that in the construction of space-perception but two senses are primarily concerned, the visual and the tactual, this would mean that the individual is biologically conditioned to this particular expression of the fundamental fact of the object's otherness by the possession of two senses which in the past, through the influence of heredity and environment, have served as the vehicles of objectivity.

From the presentational side, for example, the atom is taken to be a simple, indivisible, physical ultimate, not a center of force or ' a category.' * Force is regarded as an entity, something in things, and is separable from mass; action is always by impact and action at a distance impossible. When the objective and struc- tural is emphasized to the exclusion of the functional aspect, life and consciousness are said to originate from matter, mind is either an entity which acts externally upon a physical world and is in turn acted upon by the latter, or is ' epiphenomenal' and of no real significance in the objective world of phenomena; God is either absent from the world or is the ' gaseous vertebrate' which Haeckel justly condemns; experience is interpreted in terms of mechanism. IV. Integration and Synthesis. -So far we have taken 'ob- jective' to mean presentational, and in observing the various aspects, or, if we may so call them, the recurrent phases of the self, we have followed out the part played by the presentational in our experience. But, if we reflect further upon the nature of anything which is an object, we find that it is incomplete as long as it possesses merely this static and presentational character. The idea or thing which is structurally a group of experiences, actual or possible, presents itself with the requirement that it be taken as representative of other groups. It is not properly an experience, if it is simply presented.' No doubt this is paradox- ical; but, says Professor Royce, who has most fruitfully de- veloped this phase of idealism, " reality is often much more paradoxical than any philosophical system, and the actual be- haviour of mankind contains more inconsistencies than a thinker could with all his efforts put together." An object must be presented in order that it may be experienced as an object, but in its merely presentational aspect it is never what it purports to be, and hence is never really an object.

[VOL. XII. sented, is limited and defined for consciousness as ' this thing' and thus contrasted with something outside it, so that its real nature must still be found in its relationship to something that is more than self. To be conscious of a thing is to be aware of it as part of a larger plan or system, and it is only the specific nature of the plan which theory has ever successfully denied. Any ex- perience is partial and requires completion, and this relationship which the object requires can ultimately be found only in an all- inclusive system of experiences. But ideas, as unified groups of inner experience, are objects; the difference between idea and external thing is a difference merely between self-group and other-group experiences. And an ideal relationship is required quite as much as that type of relationship which demands that in one presentational fact a is to be found the reason or cause of another presentational fact b.' Ultimately, idealism concludes, the relational process implicates the existence of an Absolute Experi- ence, or, since the notion of a system of experience is implied in the object's demand for relation, an Absolute Self. Experience must be, in one universal aspect, " one self-determined and conse- quently absolute and organized whole." 2 However, as the self is, according to realism, always reducible to an aggregate of hypothetical presentational processes, real re- lationship cannot be found in the self, but in the system of proc- esses regarded in their presentational aspect. Reality is, then, 'matter' or ' force' or ' atoms,' or it may be simply ' presenta- tional phenomena.' Both idealism and realism regard the an- tithesis between self and object as unreal or phenomenal. Ideal- ism, taking the object to be merely phenomenal, finds its reality in a higher self which includes the antitheses; realism, on the other hand, regarding the self as phenomenal or 'epiphenomenal,' finds its only reality in the interrelation of physical processes. Ideal- ism, by regarding the external world as phenomenal, takes a static view of physical processes and a dynamic view of the self, 1 Cause cannot be described as a mere sequence, but must be regarded as invariable sequence; a, and not d or c, is taken as representative of b; but a is like all things a process, and it is a representation only as the complex is taken to be part of a larger system or plan. Causes are never apart from plan. 2 Royce: The Conceoption of God, p. 41.</page><page sequence="12">No. I.] INTERPRETA 71ON OF SELF. 27 while realism takes a structural and static view of the self, and a dynamic and functional view of physical processes. We ought, however, to take both a structural and a dynamic view of expe- rience with the self as an inner group of experiences among others. If we consider the two opposing attitudes toward reality, we shall find agreement in the following respects: (i) The object is something that has been abstracted from a larger context of ex- perience, which is more or less clearly taken to be a system, but which is regarded, in the one case, as the totality of physical things, and, in the other, as a subjective totality; (2) the object is incomplete apart from relations which are in the one case phys- ical processes, in the other ideal relations; (3) there must be a homogeneous medium for the expression of these relations; hence this vaguely defined context of experience must definitely unfold itself as intelligible plan. For idealism the self fulfills this require- ment, while for realism and positivism, it is matter or phenom- enal sequences devoid of meaning. And there is no satisfactory answer, if we endeavor to sum up experience in one term. An object must always turn out to be dependent upon the self, while the self in its turn ends by being my self, and is thus in dependence upon the physical organism. If experience is always polarized as subject and object, if these are two omnipresent aspects of experience, the real question re- garding its interpretation is not, does an Absolute Self exist ? or, on the other hand must experience be explained ultimately in presentational terms ? but, how must such an Absolute Self be conceived at any given stage of human progress, so that it may be adequate to the structural account; and, in turn, what place does mechanism occupy in a philosophy of experience as a whole ? As one view is the correction of gross anthropomorphism, the other conserves the ideal element in experience and makes meaningful the abstract descriptions of science. Without mechanism and law, the world would be lost in superstition; without an ideal self, there would be an end to human endeavor. If it is true that ex- perience is always in some sense a plan, wherever we turn to those distinctions which arise within it; and if, therefore, a methodo-</page><page sequence="13">28 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XII. logical monism of some sort is always tacitly presupposed, the opposition between idealism and realism must always appear to some minds in somewhat the same way as it did to Strauss. He says: " I have always tacitly regarded the so loudly proclaimed contrast between materialism and idealism (or by whatever terms we may designate the view opposed to the former) as a mere quarrel about words. They have a common foe in the dualism which has pervaded the world (Weltansiclit) through the whole Christian era, dividing man into soul and body, his existence into time 1 and eternity, and opposing an eternal creator to a created and perishable universe.2 If it is true that methodologically our thoughts are " the expression of molecular changes in the matter of life which is the source of our other vital phenomena," I it is no less true that thought in its representational aspect requires com- pletion in that ideal system of experience which the term self in its representational or functional character denotes. In summary: The nature of experience is such that an Abso- lute Self present in our own experience as a concept or represen- tation of completely organized experience in its ideal aspect must be a postulate of reason; while, on the other hand, experience in its presentational aspect requires the assumption of non-ideal or presentational units as working hypotheses by which changing processes may be understood. Ideal relationship must be seen in terms of structure, and structure must be understood in terms of ideal relationship. Matter and force, for example, are idealiza- tions of experience in its presentational aspect, constantly modi- fied and reconceptualized to meet the demands of an ever-widen- ing outlook upon the world of processes. But now we have to consider some objections, for the absolute character of the self may be called in question. In the first place, it may be said than an Absolute Self does nothing, and therefore is of no moment to us, while real and definite knowledge about experience comes through the categories of science, which are I See later discussion of time and the timeless in this article. 2 Strauss: Der Alte und der neue Glaube, p. 212, quoted by Professor Orr in his Christian View of God and the World, p. 144. 3Huxley: Lay Sermons.

The first objection may be admitted. "1 If the absolute cannot be comprehended as it is in itself, this is the same as saying that there is for us no Absolute." ' The answer is, however, that the determination of the concrete nature of the Absolute Self, which makes the latter the supreme object of religion and of the philosophy of religion, is justified by the same principle broadly viewed which requires us to assume that atoms have a definite size or shape, or ether has mo- tion, that they act by impact or through magnetic fields, or that in the molecules of one substance they have a definite configuration, while in the molecules of another the relationship of the constit- uent atoms is different. This principle is that the ultimate unit, whether self or atom, both of which are beyond the scope of actu- ally presented experience, must be viewed in relation to experience of which it is to serve as an explanation, and must therefore be characterized by attributes or properties; for any real concept must be representative of experience, although these attributes or properties are derived in the one case from relations discoverable within the science of physics or chemistry, in the other from human and ideal relations, discoverable in ethics and sociology or displayed in history and in life. But the functional or dynamic view must be continually modified to meet the requirements of an ever more exact description, while the structural view is con- stantly being readjusted to the former, although this may be less obvious to the pure empiricist. The history of the conflict be- tween religious and scientific thought is the exhibition of this perpetual process of readjustment. If, for example, God is for the religious consciousness no longer an extraneous power, en- dowed with human attributes, acting workmanlike upon a world of limiting matter, but an all-embracing personal consciousness in which man lives and moves and has his being, this ideal i Watson: " The New Ethical Philosophy," InternationalJournalof Ethics, July, x899, Vol. IX, No. 4, p. 413.</page><page sequence="15">30 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XI!. character of experience has impressed itself upon the categories of science which the structural view recognizes. Matter is no longer a substrate; force is no longer something in things, but a mere name for mass-acceleration ;' hooks and loops no longer describe the atom which is now less an entity than ' a category.' In answer to the second objection, we conclude that " anthropo- morphism is not a reproach, if one does but see the man to whom the world is likened in his world-wide, world-deep character- istics."2 " All science and philosophy are anthropomorphic and it is not possible for the human being to be other than anthropo- morphic." 3 But all our categories or representations, if in one respect subjective and finite, since they must inevitably be re- ferred to the self-group and always bear the impress of the human organism, are, in an aspect no less real, objective and other than finite. Moreover, functional or worth-estimates of things involve a transcendence of experience no more than the descriptive categories of science. If experiences cannot be properly evaluated without the employment of description and presentative relations, description no less involves functional and ideal values; for wherever there is the isolation of thing from thing or of cause from effect, there is representation only. And now, if we must regard human and ideal relations as in some way represented in an absolute experience, if this Absolute Self is partly revealed or represented in the attributes which the religious consciousness applies to a supreme being, and if the conception of an Absolute Self becomes real only as it is brought into relation to actual experiences,4 there is implied a view of the individual self which must supplement the psychological account. Although personality may mean a sum of psychological selves, it is also more that this. But here we experience a difficulty.

If we assent to this proposition, we put in doubt the existence of the Absolute. The latter was found to be the requirement of the relational process, and the assumed reality of present incomplete experience was the ground for affirming its existence. If now the reality of the former is denied on the ground that the Absolute is the only complete in- dividual, the ladder of the relational process is cut from beneath our feet. We must choose between an Absolute Self which is mere idea and the reality of the empirical selves from which the Absolute is distinguished and by reference to which it is known. The chief source of the difficulty is our way of regarding time. The logical process of thought which asserts the existence of an Absolute requires us to regard this Absolute as timeless, since temporal distinctions within an experience mean incompleteness. But, on the other hand, the logical movement of thought cannot be isolated from the concrete associational processes of the individual into which time always enters. How can we have knowledge of the timeless, if our experience is always of the temporal ? We seem reduced to an 'either-or' between pure empiricism and metaphysic, and must either abandon our speculative conclusion the Absolute-or assert that the timeless alone is real and the temporal mere appearance. The concluding portion of this paper will therefore be concerned with the relation of the individual to the Absolute from the point of view of this new difficulty which has emerged. V.

This is not the standpoint of The World and the Individual, and the quotation is inserted only as the expression of a very real difficulty.

[VOL. XII. related in a wholly objective time order, there is no organic unity in things or ideas. But we found that relationship is a requirement of any experience, whether viewed from the objective or subjective aspect. It then seems to follow that time cannot be an objective reality, but must be subjective. If, secondly, we assert the subjectivity of time, we must recognize with Kant that we put our own stamp upon everything that enters into the temporal series, and it must again be denied that the relational order means anything apart from our point of view. In the third place, we may simply accept the unreality of time and declare that the timeless alone is real. Now, however, everything which enters into the temporal series will be 'transmuted' into some- thing other than itself, and any experience in time will be an experience of phenomena merely and thus unreal. In any case, our conception of time is unsatisfactory, because we isolate the temporal and the timeless, or rather, to put the matter more intelligibly, because we fail to recognize the temporal character of the logical process at the same time with the time- less character of the psychological process involved in judgment. The former we regard as timeless, the latter as temporal, without recognition of their connection. Now we have already taken the view that space is constitutive in our experience, a form of thought, not something which hides reality from the mind, or an objective entity which puts an insep- arable barrier between thought and thing. It is possible that we may take a similar view of time. By this I do not mean simply that the processes of thought require time, but that the logical process of thought, which, taken formally, is merely analytic, is, when employed in the effort to reach conclusions about actual experience, relational and synthetic only as we at any moment refuse to take time as mere succession. For in judgment we at any moment transcend our experience of mere succession and treat past and present as parts or aspects of one unitary complex or representation. Let us take, for example, the judgment of identity, 'a is a.' This is perfectly intelligible, if we take the judgment in its merely formal acceptation. But there are no empirically given instances of identity, although, if the judgment</page><page sequence="18">No. I.] INTERPRETATION OF SELF. 33 really means anything, it intends to assert identity between two actual contents of experience. Accordingly, between the concrete or experiential and the abstract or formal there is a great gulf fixed. Yet, if the judgment means anything at all, a must signify an actual fact, or object or content of experience. The judgment would then be: experience is of such a nature that a is a. But, in accordance with our previous conclusions, a is never a com- plete object until it has found relation to something which is more than itself, and we cannot assert identity of an object whose meaning and objectivity do not completely belong to it. By the judgment a is a, there must then always be meant a relation of two actual experiences; for the a as subject and the a as predicate are separate contents of experience. In the judgment, we cancel the temporal difference between the two experiences, and affirm their homogeneity in a third or inclusive experience which is the ground of the judgment; that is, time, which in its perceptual form establishes a difference between a as subject and a as pred- icate, enters as a relational or conceptual process into the judg- ment. In other words, in the process of judgment we are at any moment under the control of a guiding complex of ideas, an ideal whole,' and judgment takes place only as the successive experi- ences which are denoted by subject and predicate are regarded as aspects of this ideal whole or unitary complex, which is for the moment taken to be their completion and in which they find their meaning. Now the empirical self was previously taken to mean nothing more than a complex of processes, structurally an aggregate, but unitary in so far as the association-groups of which it is composed are determinative of thought or action. It is simply the ideal complex which accompanies the judgment over again on a larger scale. To paraphrase Kant, it is this ideal complex, an aggre- gate, yet in its representative function unitary, which is the form in which all our experiences are cast. If, then, in any judgment we are forced beyond mere succession, this timelessness or con- ceptual aspect of time must in some way belong to the empirical self, and these various ' selves ' of past, present, and future must ' Cf Stout: Manual of PsychoZogy, Lond. ed., i899, Vol. II, p. 448.</page><page sequence="19">34 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XII. have a timeless as well as a temporal aspect. Somewhere, then, the empirical self of the moment 1 possesses a timeless reality; it is, in the latter aspect, part of a plan or representation which stands in a specific and unique relation to the temporal experi- ences of the individual. It is not simply a phase of the Absolute Self which thinks or experiences in the individual, but is the tem- poral embodiment of a representation in the experience of an Absolute Self and possesses a reality and worth of its own. We may now apply these results in a consideration of the nature of personality. We had previously found that an ideal synthesis is, equally with an objective synthesis, the requirement of partial and fragmentary experience, and that an all-inclusive system of experience, an Absolute Self, is demanded by the relational process in its ideal aspect. If, however, such an Abso- lute Self is taken to be real, one cannot deny the reality of the relational process by which the result is reached. The empirical self, then, in spite of its incompleteness and its temporal char- acter, is also real; for the same process which leads us to assume the reality of an Absolute Self affirms also the reality of the frag- mentary empirical self which enters into the temporal processes. The empirical selves, then, cannot be regarded simply as aspects of an Absolute Self in which their meaning is absorbed; for the empirical self of the moment gets its specific character from the experiences of the individual which occur in time, and, therefore, bears a real relation to these experiences. In conclusion, the thought which I have wished to express in the present article is this: any experience is both objective, or pres- entational, and ideal. It must, therefore, be interpreted in terms which express not only its presentational aspect, but those ideal relations which are made known to us through the experience of what we term self. All ultimate categories are, like the atom, "hypothetical determinations of the Ding-an-sich," 1 the unchar- 11. e., "Any instant of finite consciousness" which "partially embodies a purpose and so possesses its own Internal Meaning.

The given experience of the moment is like a ring on which are painted at opposite poles of its diameter a red and a white band, one repre- senting the antithetical object of attention, the other the subjective self. Upon the ring we may slide an iron band which denotes relationship. When the band covers the red ring, the object is no longer static but relational, and, if the self happens to be the object of attention, it too falls into discrete parts, to be linked together by mechanical means. When the band of relationship is slipped to the white ring, the self is the bearer of all relations and the object shrinks to a mere point. Into whatever parts experience falls, it is always at once both subject and object. The self, we conclude, is a symbol -like any ' thing' named and characterized. Its reality is not adequately represented in categories of ' permanence,' 'substantiality,' and the like; for it is not something behind or more real than experience. It is not an entity but a law, which, like any other law, denotes a unique type of relationship within experience, its inner and individual aspect which the presentational method of science cannot reach. And the individual is at the center of that law, as to all other laws he is external. Each individual thing which, by means of time and space, objectifies and idealizes the content of a given object- consciousness is the embodiment of law, which to other individ- uals is external only and thus scattered among the laws of 'natural ' processes. Regarded in its structural aspect, this type of relationship, which rightfully claims that experience must be interpreted in terms of an Absolute Self, gives way to an objective synthesis which finds in one presentational fact the reason or cause of another. Structurally, this Absolute Self must be regarded as the world of presentational processes ; but these are, however, subjectively its own external life and expression. We must view the world as an organism, and progress in thought as an approach to a true knowledge of the organic.
