<plain_text><page sequence="1">BORIA SAX The Mermaid and Her Sisters From Archaic Goddess to Consumer Society Upstarted the mermaid by the ship Wi ' a glass and a k√§me in her hand, Says - Reek about , reek about , my merry men, Ye are not very far from the land. Ye lie, ye lie, ye bonny mermaid, Sae loud as I heard you lie, For sin I hae seen your face this night The land I will never see. - "Ballade of Sir Patrick Spens" The heroes of Greece have embarked on a voyage to distant shores in order to bring back the fabled golden fleece. Among them are Her- cules, Orpheus, the Dioscuri, and all the legendary figures of that re- mote time. Jason is their leader. They disembark briefly on a rich, fer- tile plain and prepare a banquet. Hercules wanders off to make a new oar. Meanwhile, Hylas, a young boy whom Hercules has adopted, searches for water. He finds a spring, just as the nymphs, who have assembled from mountain peaks and caverns, are about to start their dances. A naiad emerges from the spring, when Hylas approaches. She sees his face, radiant in the moonlight, and is overwhelmed by his beauty. As Hylas reaches into the water with a pitcher, she throws her arms around him. Then, as she kisses Hylas, she pulls him into the spring. One sailor hears the cry of Hylas and summons Hercules, who is overwhelmed by grief. Hercules is so intent on finding the young man that he forgets his other companions, and the Argo sails on with- out him. This story, the quintessential mermaid legend, is from The Voyage of the Argo, written by Apollonius of Rhodes in the Third Century B.C.</page><page sequence="2">44 ISLE (68-70). We never learn the fate of Hylas or, for that matter, Hercules. The naiad, like mermaids in the lore of mariners a millennium later, is beautiful and mysterious but impulsive and, at least from the point of view of the mariners, amoral. She lures the young man away from the patriarchal world of the ship, from moral obligations and masculine com- panionship. He leaves the realm of civilization and enters that of nature. Whether this is a blessing or a curse remains, as in many stories of mer- maids, an open question. Hercules, of course, is the strongest and most virile of heroes, a figure who represents masculinity as unequivocally as the naiad represents the feminine world. It is not clear in the tale whether there is a homosexual relationship between Hercules and Hylas. How- ever that may be, there a strong suggestion of jealousy, when the mighty hero searches for his companion. On a more mundane level, it is not altogether unlike what sometimes happens when a young man marries and must leave behind the world of his bachelor friends. Whoever searches for the origin of the mermaid in myth and legend will encounter a bewildering array of related figures. Nevertheless, it seems impossible to trace any clear line of descent. The enormous power of the mermaid over the elements and her habitual isolation suggest that the mermaid could go back to extremely archaic mother-goddess figures such as the Sumerian Ninhursag, the Babylonian Hamat, and the Greek Gaia. Perhaps she was banished to the sea when power was transferred to anthropomorphic male deities. Tiamat, especially, has some resemblance to a mermaid. She gives birth to the world, yet it remains covered in waters. When the god Marduk has kills her, dry land is made from her body (Daley 221-277). She is a figure of primeval nature, iden- tified with the sea, and enemy of the settled life of civilization. At any rate, the earliest representation of merpeople, with a human torso and the tail of the fish, come from Babylon. The Mesopotamian god of the sea - known variously as "Ea," "Enki," or "Oanes" - was represented with the torso of a human being and the tail of a fish. So was Atargatis, the Syrian goddess of love. The fish man is mentioned repeatedly in the Babylonian Epic of Creation, probably from the early first millennium before Christ. He is part of the army of Tiamat. Tradition makes the ocean a remnant of the primeval chaos, surround- ing the land and its kingdoms. It impressed early people as an endless- ly fertile womb, from which new forms of life constantly emerged. The variety of life within the ocean is far greater than that on land, and it is still far less thoroughly explored. The structural similarity among most vertebrates, with their legs and arms, is easy to observe. Many inverte- brates from the sea, from octopuses to clams to sea anemones, seem entirely unlike anything else in the entire world. According to Hesiod in his Theogony, Aphrodite, the Roman Venus, first emerged from the</page><page sequence="3">The Mermaid and Her Sisters 45 ocean when it was fertilized from the sperm of the castrated Uranus (8-9). The myth illustrates both the fecundity of the ocean and its iden- tification with the female gender. Another of the many figures of the ancient world which anticipate the mermaid is the daughter of the Dnieper River god, who had the torso of a woman and the tail of a serpent. When Hercules was travel- ing, a storm overtook him. He wrapped himself in his lion skin and went to sleep. When he woke, Hercules found the mares that drew his chariot had wandered away. He searched for them until he came to the cave of the serpent woman. She confessed to having the mares in her possession, but she would only give them back if Hercules made love to her. The kings of Scythia were descended from their children. The story comes from Herodotus, who attributes it to the Scythians (298- 299). As in so many later tales of mermaids, a man is driven from his enterprise by the elements. Here, it is the mares, female creatures made to do the work of men, who lead him to the mysterious enchantress. Myth, literature, and folk belief blended in the lore of mariners dur- ing the early modern period, to create the popular image of the mer- maid. Representations of mermaids were carved on the bows of ships, etched in scrimshaw, tattooed on bodies, painted on the signs of tav- erns, and included in heraldic crests. The sea was, together with the army, a bastion of unadulterated male companionship, a place where a young man might go to at least temporarily forswear the company of woman after an unhappy love affair. Simply to have a woman on board was sometimes considered bad luck. Even traditionally female occu- pations such as cooking were undertaken by men at sea. In Melville's Moby-Dick, that great epic of life at sea, Starbuck alone among the ma- jor characters is married. For that reason, he can never fully belong to the world of the whalers, and he does not join them in the mad hunt after the white whale. Mariners, however, conceived of both the ships and the waves as feminine. Simply to embark on a voyage was, there- fore, to enter the feminine world, to place oneself at the mercy of un- known powers. The mermaid embodied the wonder and terror of the sea, which drew the sailors even to their doom. The bestial part of the mermaid was an extension of her femininity. It is now hard for us to imagine the fear and wonder that the sea aroused from Antiquity and the Middle Ages up through most of the modern period. After the destruction of Troy, the Greek princes Diomedes, Odysseus, Menelaus, and Agamemnon find the voyage home more hazardous than the war had ever been. Life at sea was extremely precarious. Beyond simple luck, there was little defense against storms. Ships could also run aground on rocks, coral reefs, or icebergs. Especially before the use of the compass in the late Middle</page><page sequence="4">46 ISLE Ages, navigation was largely a matter of intuition. Ships might easily be blown off course and lost forever. Diseases, easily picked up in for- eign ports, would spread extremely easily among the those confined to a ship. There many tales of sea serpents that might drag down an entire vessel. The rocking of a ship, like the pulse of a living thing, was a perpetual reminder of the surrounding waves. The nearly endless number of nautical superstitions shows how vulnerable early seamen much have felt to the powers of the elements. The archaic belief that a drowning person has been taken by spirits of the water, who will be angry if deprived of their victim, has been very persistent. In Shakespeare's Hamlet , witnesses watch Ophelia drown yet none attempt to save her, perhaps out of such a fear (Hole 141). Mariners usually thought of a mermaid as such a spirit of water, perhaps intent on claiming them for her own. Even the sight of a mermaid could inspire terror. Sometimes, sailors would try to distract a mermaid by throwing coins or trinkets into the water (Beck 243), in much the same way as ancient people would placate local deities by tossing sacrificial objects into a well. In one African- American tale recorded in the early twentieth century, a captain threw a crew member over board when a mermaid demanded him. The sailor who was sacrificed was last seen by the crew wrapped in the yellow hair of the mermaid and drawn down into the depths. He married the mermaid and lived as her husband for six years before finding his way back to land (Benwell and Waugh 209). If a mari- ner went down into the sea and no body was found, how could one know for sure that he was dead? There are many such stories of sailors living on in the kingdom beneath the waves. In ways, the fraternity of mariners was like a monastic order. The behavior of sailors was notoriously unmonkish when the ships reached shore. Many would indulge in a few days of drunkenness, visits to brothels, and brawling, before setting off to sea again. Even at sea, their manners and language would be rough. Unlike monks, mariners were often uneducated. Nevertheless, the ship was like a monastery in its exclusion of women, as well as in the austerity and deprivation it re- quired. In addition, both ship and monastery were separated, in both physical and cultural ways, from the rest of society. Both involved a sort of renunciation of the world. Finally, both involved cultivating sensitivities, both physical and spiritual, which were not easily acces- sible to most people outside. Carrying the analogy a bit further, we might say that the mermaid was, for mariners, a sort of pagan equiva- lent of Mary, a figure of primal feminine power. This monastic quality of maritime life may be found in the tale "The Seven Mermaids," recorded on the Frisian Islands, where the sea again proves a jealous mistress. A sailor, while disembarking, raises his hand</page><page sequence="5">The Mermaid and Her Sisters 47 to the sea and solemnly pledges his loyalty to the sea. If the waters treat him well, he promises, he will be faithful to them always and never take a home on land. Seven mermaids rise to the surface and listen to his promise, then they plunge once again beneath the sea. The mariner pros- pers and becomes a wealthy man, but he longs for a settled life. Finally, he takes a bride. On the night of his wedding, the seven mermaids rose from the deep near his home beside the sea. They send huge waves that leap over the dikes and pull the man from the arms of his beloved. They carry him beneath the sea. Since then, the sailor is sometimes seen trying to return to his bride, but the mermaids drag him back to their home (Sax 246-247). The mariner here represents all who dream of giving up the life at sea yet find themselves constantly drawn back to it. The same themes are found in "The Shepard and the Sea," written by Jean de la Fontaine in the seventeenth century. A shepard has lived for many years contentedly grazing his sheep beside the shore. He is dazzled by the sight of merchants unloading their cargoes from around the world, so he sells his flock and buys a ship. On its first voyage, the ship strikes a rock. Ruined financially, the shepard is forced to work for others. Even- tually, he manages to buy back some of his sheep. Then, on a tranquil day, he calls to the sisters of the sea that they should tempt another, for he knows better than to trust them. A famous nineteenth-century illus- tration by J. J. Grandville shows a mermaid emerging from the deep with her hair flowing about her naked body and her arms outstretched. The shepard, on shore, looks away from her with a dismissive gesture (La Fontaine 88-90). The mermaid personifies the sea. Men are drawn to her, as to the life of a mariner, by an erotic attraction. This is heightened by danger as well as the mystery of the ocean and its storms. In the early twentieth century, the poet W. B. Yeats, reflecting back on a troubled love affair of his, wrote "The Mermaid": A mermaid found a swimming lad, Picked him for her own, Pressed her body to his body, Laughed; and plunging down Forgot in cruel happiness That even lovers drown. (222) Nature is traditionally personified as feminine. As explorers journeyed to even the remotest parts of the globe in the early modern period, the sea was, as it still remains, the final remnant of unspoiled nature. As people described almost all of the remaining land animals, they still had little notion of what might lurk under the sea. The were rumors of enormous monsters and legends of mysterious kingdoms. The image of the mermaid, as it is familiar to us, emerged with the</page><page sequence="6">48 ISLE expansion of trade in maritime culture at the end of the Middle Ages. Except for the virtually absolute exclusion of women, this culture was enormously cosmopolitan. Folklore from cultures throughout the world was blended on board ships. The mermaid took something from the Slavic Rusalkis, the German Nixies, and many other water sprites of world folk- lore. Melusine, the serpent woman, whose story formed the basis of many literary tales of mermaids, was a product of archiac mythologies. Her story had been absorbed into the folldore of Cyprus. It reached Europe in the cultural exchanges that accompanied the crusades (Sax 81-97). For several centuries, mermaids were sighted almost constantly, es- pecially in the Atlantic. Columbus and his crew sighted one, as did captain John Smith (Beck 248). Rather typical is the account by Samuel Purchas, a seaman who accompanied Henry Hudson on his second voyage to the New World. Purchas records in his diary that on May 15, 1608 one sailor spotted a mermaid. She was close to the ship and look- ing earnestly at the men. The sailor called to his companions, but only one other arrived before she disappeared into the waves. Purchas de- scribes the mermaid as being a woman with from the navel upward. Her breasts were exposed and her skin was very white. Her hair was long and black. Her tail, which turned upward as she descended into the deep, was speckled like that of a mackerel. The mariners do not seem to have attached enormous importance to the sighting. It is casu- ally included alongside reports of the weather. Purchas himself makes no claim to have seen the mermaid. Though a fairly sophisticated ob- server, he gives the report without any hint of skepticism (575). Most researchers believe the majority of reported mermaid sightings were actually of manatees, which can appear very human when seen from a distance. The sightings could also have been of seals, which appear very gracefully feminine. John M. MacAulay has recently ar- gued that some of the sightings at least might have been of kayakers from Greenland or other places in the far North. The play of light and shadow on the waves in different kinds of weather could also have created illusions. The most obvious explanation of the mermaid sightings is that they were hallucinations of sailors who had grown desperate for female companionship. The idea that the mermaids were hallucination caused by sexual deprivation, however, raises questions. Were the mariners truly so desirous of seeing women, why did they exclude them from the ship in the first place? Furthermore, why did they not simply hallucinate women? And why, in any case, did they choose to go to sea at all? The only female on board would often be the ship's cat. She seemed to acquire a supernatural power, being close to realms of experience inac- cessible to the mariners. They sometimes believed a cat had the power</page><page sequence="7">The Mermaid and Her Sisters 49 to bring gales. The behavior of the cat was closely watched for signs of impending changes in the weather and in fortune. The order in which a cat licked her paws might, for example, tell whether rain was to be ex- pected. The cat received very chivalrous treatment, since injury to her could excite the elements (Briggs 70-71). The environment of the ship was, in fact, as exclusively feminine as the crew was male. Even the ship was referred to as "she." The crew was a masculine enclave in an other- wise feminine universe. The mermaids, who embodied this universe, had a heightened femininity simply by being part animal. Much like the ship's cat, a mermaid, if sighted, would be watched intently. If she turned away from the ship, it was a sign of good for- tune. If she followed the ship, the would fear disaster (Beck 243). If a mermaid, picked up fish and threw them away from the ship, it meant that at least none of the crew would be killed in a disaster. If she threw them toward the ship, at least some members of the crew were doomed (Benwell and Waugh 85). Mermaids, of course, could be friendly and helpful, but one could never take their good will for granted. Many tales'record of terrible revenge taken by mermaids on those who harmed or offended them. Once a mermaid rescued a drowning sailor, asking only that he visit her. When he did not come, his entire village was washed away in a tidal wave (Beck 232). The mermaid is plainly very sexual, yet not in the same way as nor- mal women. Perhaps it is a sort of primeval, and therefore unformed, sexuality. She represents fertility, understood not as having children [she has them rarely] but the enormous power of the ocean to generate unknown forms of life. Sexual intercourse between man and mermaid is not easily imaginable, since the mermaid is a fish beneath the waist. Marriage presents a lot of difficulties, since men and mermaids live in different elements. Though here is generally a mutual fascination be- tween sailor and mermaid, neither of them consistently desires that kind of union. The mermaid often sees the sailor as a plaything. Her attachment to him is a sort of adolescent crush, which might be simply charming if not for her enormous power. The sailor seeks protection against the sea and perhaps companionship. The mermaid, a figure of primeval feminine power, is almost always viewed with intense ambivalence until the early nineteenth century. As a woman, the mermaid is nearly always idealized. She has a beau- tiful complexion and long flowing hair. She is also privy to secret knowl- edge, not only of the depths of the sea but sometimes even of the fu- ture. Nevertheless, she has little understanding of human beings. She is capricious and inconstant, like the weather itself. She was a new mythological figure which was created in what seemed a time of increasing skepticism. Olalquicaga writes, "The mer-</page><page sequence="8">50 ISLE maid resurgence in the age of reason is befuddling: just when the al- legories that represented the unconscious should have been exiting through the back door, an unprecedented number of mermaid sightings took place on the European coasts, witnessed and legally certified by highly respected professionals and community members" (252). Actually, the age of reason did not destroy myths but merely displaced them further into the frontier of human exploration (Boia 32-33). The mermaid is an instance of what the historian Lucian Boia has called "l'homme diff√©rent " (13-16). This is a creature which lives in a world parallel to that of human society. L'homme diff√©rent resembles humanity in most respects, but it is different in one key feature. Such figures include, for example, giants, pygmies, fairies, amazons, yetis, and aliens from outer space. They are usually located on the bound- aries of the known world, and their location has shifted with the geo- graphic horizons of humanity. In the ancient world, they were gener- ally found, like the Sirens or Circe and other figures in Homer's Od- yssey, on remote islands. Later, as the Mediterranean world was ex- plored, the location shifted to Scythia, India, or the forests of North- ern Europe. Still later, it was the uncharted lands across the ocean, and today it is outer space. L'homme diff√©rent is constantly idealized, as either good or evil. Feelings towards these figures swing between extremes of fear, admiration, contempt, and worship. By now, the reader may be wondering: "But where were the mermen?" There were occasional reports of sightings of mermen, but those of mermaids were far more frequent. Once in a while, the mer- maids would also be seen in groups, but most of the time they were alone. This is not to suggest that the mermaids did not belong to a society. People generally thought of mermaids as living in underwater palaces. There was a very ancient and widespread belief that every creature on land has an equivalent in the sea (Benwell and Waugh 102; Rappoport 157). This is why so many marine creatures have names such as "sea cow," "seahorse," "sea anemone," "sea dog," or "sea wolf." The merpeople were the equivalent of human beings. What the sailors were for terrestrial society the mermaids were for the kingdom of the sea. Opposite in both element and gender, they shared a certain alienation and a spirit of adventure. Perhaps the no- tion of the mermaid as curious reflects an understanding of women as "daughters of Eve." Women were often thought of as in terms of that primeval female whose curiosity led to the expulsion from Eden. But the mermaid was also a reflection, an inverted image, of those on board the ship. Mermaids were generally drawn to human beings by a com- bination of curiosity, fascination, and sometimes eroticism. This was also, of course, what seamen felt for them.</page><page sequence="9">The Mermaid and Her Sisters 51 The world of the sea reversed the terrestrial order in another way. In tales where the mermaid becomes fully human, marries, and lives with her husband on land, she is almost always a conventional wife. But in the kingdom of the sea, relations between the sexes are reversed. When they take a sailor beneath the sea to marry, the mermaids are more than sexually aggressive. Very often, they kidnap reluctant mariners, in much the way that naiad captured Hylas. The word "rape" is not inappropriate in many such stories. Furthermore, the mermaids con- tinue to dominate the relationship, to a point where the poor sailor seems less a husband than a pet. This reversal of sexual roles is often characteristic of l'homme diff√©rent , which is often a diametric opposite of human society as we know it (Boia 28-29). As the ocean lost its terror, the power of the mermaid also waned. She became less a living presence and more a decorative motif, some- times a figure in tales for children. "The Little Mermaid" by Hans Chris- tian Andersen articulated a new conception of the mermaid, which found a place in countless films and books for children. The Little Mermaid is one of the daughters of the sea, but she loves to rise from the sea and watch human beings. One day, she saves a prince from drowning. As she leaves him unconscious on the shore, she falls in love with him. She then goes to the Sea Witch and asks to be given a soul, so that she can live as a human being. The Sea Witch replies that she may only obtain a soul by marrying a human being, but men find fish tails repulsive. The mermaid strikes a deal with the Sea Witch. The mermaid must give up her voice, with which she sang beautifully be- neath the waves. In return, the Sea Witch changes her tail into legs. The mermaid then enters the city of the prince. He fails to recognize her and marries another woman instead. The mermaid goes to the sea in despair. The Sea Witch gives the mermaid a knife and tells the girl to kill the prince. The mermaid is about to do so, but she throws the knife away instead. She falls into the water, which is no longer her element, and drowns. Then, instead of being annihilated, the mermaid is granted an immortal soul after all. After three hundred years she will ascend to heaven, a time that may be shortened by children being good. Like much work of Andersen, "The Little Mermaid" is conceptually close to sentimental kitsch, yet it is elevated to a far more serious level by sincerity of purpose and literary craft. It describes, as well as exem- plifies, the decline of the mermaid from a presence of great emotional power to a simple figure of entertainment. She is domesticated, brought into the human realm. First, the loss of her voice signals the declining seductive power of the mermaid and, for that matter, the sea. The voice, which sweetly calls sailors to their doom, is a feature of the sirens, first mentioned in The Odyssey of Homer. By the Middle Ages, mermaids</page><page sequence="10">52 ISLE and sirens became almost interchangeable (Berman 136). In many tales, mermaids lure sailors to impending doom with the beauty of their voices. The loss of the mermaid's voice accompanies that of her fish tail, the bestial element that makes her distinct from human beings. Entering the kingdom, the mermaid has little fascination for the prince or anybody else. In addition, the mermaid ceases to be a figure of fear. This change is signaled by her throwing away the knife. The woman in her is separated from the animal. Perhaps the story tells us that by entering the world of commerce and interacting with men women would lose some of their fascination. This domestication of the mermaid also signals a change in human relations with the natural world. As human beings developed more powerful technologies and medicines, they no longer felt themselves at the mercy of the elements. Life, even at sea, became more secure and predictable. Instead of a mighty power that must be placated, people increasingly saw nature as a vulnerable realm needing the protection of human beings. When the deities of Greece and Rome lost their visceral reality for people, they lived on as allegory. Mermaids, the most important mytho- logical figure of the late Middle Ages and Renaissance, have had an- other fate - they lived on as advertising and as kitsch. Indeed, the en- tire mythology of mermaids anticipates the use of female sexuality in advertising to a very remarkable degree. Like the sexual promises in advertisements, those of mermaids are idealized, yet they are gener- ally incapable of consummation. As with the mermaid, the female sexu- ality that is promulgated by the mass media is intensified by identifi- cation with animals. The women of Playboy are called "bunnies," while those of Penthouse are "pets." Their sexuality is supposedly free and easy, yet to know them is impossible. They exist in an idealized world, a bit like that fabled kingdom beneath the sea. Like the undersea world imagined by Andersen, it is soulless and beautiful. It is a place without want, jealousy, or disease. The portals of this mysterious realm are guarded by armies of make-up artists, lighting technicians, hairdress- ers, dieticians, copywriters, and others. But let us remember that the seduction of the mermaid is generally to death. Perhaps this reflects the apocalyptic fears that have accompa- nied the rise of modernity. Prior to the end of World War II, this usu- ally meant some image of either dehumanization or social collapse, articulated by authors as various as George Orwell and Rachel Carson. In the late twentieth century, this has usually meant either a nuclear holocaust or an ecological disaster. All scenarios are very speculative, and nobody can really judge the prospect of nuclear war, let alone the consequences or global warming or accelerated species extinction. That</page><page sequence="11">The Mermaid and Her Sisters 53 such fears are profoundly rooted in our culture, however, cannot be denied. We can interpret the seduction of the mermaid as the lure of modernity or capitalism, constantly enticing us into unknown terri- tory. The foreboding that accompanies the mermaid's song, then, may be terror that goes with social and technological upheavals. Today the mermaid appears constantly in advertising. Her image is used to sell Carlsberg beer, Starkist tuna, and Starbuck's coffee. Ariel, the Little Mermaid in Disney Studios' 1991 cartoon based on Andersen's tale, is often featured in advertisements for fast food at McDonald's. She also sells a vast assortment of merchandise from lunch boxes and school notebooks to dolls. Even more significantly, the mermaid adorns countless tourist brochures, pubs, restaurants, tourist shops, and aquari- ums. The sea in which the mermaid leads us is that of spending and consumption. The mermaid has been absorbed into the kitsch of mod- ern [and postmodern] culture with remarkable ease. This is because, even at its period of greatest visceral reality, the figure foreshadowed this culture. The traditional depiction of a mermaid, gazing in the mir- ror and combing her hair, anticipates the self-absorption that is charac- teristic of consumer society. Saul Friedlander has argued that kitsch is a debased form of myth. One form is the "kitsch of death," "not real death in its everyday horror and tragic banality, but a ritualized, stylized, and aestheticized death . . (43). This reached a culmination in the culture of Nazi Germany, and it is cer- tainly present in action adventure films of today. For Rambo and his ilk, both killing and dying are hardly more than sport. Olalquiaga points out that kitsch, since its inception in the nineteenth century, has been con- stantly obsessed with death. For the Victorians, it consisted initially in collecting reminders of a natural world that was disappearing, of life that had been lost: butterflies pinned to a mat, bones, shells. In the modern world, this became a proliferation of useless commodities, especially souvenirs, which also celebrate a lost vitality (11-87). At the outset of the modern world, nature was conceived prima- rily as a place. In its purest form, that meant exotic lands where few if any Europeans had set foot. Later, as virtually the entire globe had been explored, it increasingly meant a certain sort of comportment. To be natural meant, as applied to people, an attitude that was open, spontaneous, and uncorrupted by the artifice of society. Often, it meant "flouting convention." A natural human being was one who, even surrounded by society, somehow managed to maintain the primeval vitality of animals. The animal provided the implicit metaphor. It is, however, difficult to give an example of this, since the judgement is very subjective. Is Rambo a "natural man" of the height of artifice? Perceptions will differ.</page><page sequence="12">54 ISLE Since Darwin's Theory of Evolution, the boundary between human beings and animals has become ever more elusive. We now under- stand that we are at once human beings and animals, yet these two aspects of identity have not merged. The line between nature and civi- lization now runs through each of us. It is harder than ever to give a clear definition of "nature," but we often experience this as a sort of siren song. There is hardly an advertisement which does not somehow appeal to a longing for either a lost paradise or for primal vitality. "The Club Med vacation / The antidote for civilization" goes one advertis- ing jingle that just about everybody has heard. The mermaid, half woman and half fish, is a fitting symbol for our divided selves. REFERENCES Andersen, Hans Christian. Tales and Stories by Hans Christian Andersen. Trans. Patricia L.
