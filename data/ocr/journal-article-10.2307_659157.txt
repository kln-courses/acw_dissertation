<plain_text><page sequence="1">PERIODICAL LITERATURE CONDUCTED BY DR ALEXANDER F. CHAMBERLAIN [NOTE.-Authors, especially those whose articles appear in journals and other serials not entirely devoted to anthropology, will greatly aid this department of the American Anthrohologist by sending direct to Dr A. F. Chamberlain, Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts, U. S. A., reprints or copies of such studies as they may desire to have noticed in these pages. - EDITOR.] GENERAL Balfour (H.) Presidential a d d r e s s. (Rep. Brit. Ass. Adv. Sci., Lond., 1904 [1905], LXXIV, 689-700.) Treats of the evolutional studies of Col. Lane Fox in the material arts of man, the compara- tive study of the musical instruments of modern savage and barbaric peoples, the phylogenetic history of the products of human industry, the ethnologic study of primitive races,- "most savage races are in a large measure strictly primitive" (e. g. Tasmanians). Barton (W. J. ) The distribution of rural occupations. (Geogr. Teacher, Lond., 1905, III, 28-31, map.) Abstracted from Hahn's Die Haustiere (Leipzig, 1896). Bdrillon (E.) Les femmes a barbe. (R. de l'Hyp., Paris, 9o05, xIx, I95-203 ; 1905, xx, 2-11, 35-46, 68-78, 99-108; 134-142, I67-I76, I98-209, many fgs.) Continues and ends an interesting psy- chological and sociological study of bearded women, ancient and modern, real and in art and imagination. Heredity in the matter of "bearded women " seems to come from the father. Dr B. is in- clined, with Brandt, to consider the bearded woman prophetic, --JFrance, "the most advanced in many aspects of evolutions,' '-leads ; here slightly hirsute women of this type are rather common. Psychology and education will, however, prevent any character-change in woman being induced by her "beard." Cams (P.) Image worship. (Open Ct., Chicago, 1905, XIX, 21-25.) C. states that the early Christians were iconoclasts and " the whole Christian symbology is due to pagan influence and pagan tradi- tions." Curious is the worship of "black Marys," - their images are still found in Latin Europe, etc. Pagan Christs. (Ibid., 92-99.) Based on J. M. Robertson's Pagan Christs (Lond., 190o3). Refers to the Mithraic eucharist, the religious cannibal- ism of the ancient Mexicans, the Peni- tentes of New Mexico and their passion play. Professor Mills, the Zendavesta scholar. (Ibid., 505-509, portr. ) Sketch of life and activities of L. H. Mills, professor of Zend philology in the University of Oxford, and Zoroastrian scholar. - The reality of the devil. (Ibid., 717-736, 11 fgs.) The illustrations are of ethnic interest. Froideveaux (H.) L'histoire g6ogra- phique et l'histoire coloniale au Congrds de Stuttgart. (J. Soc. d. Am6r. de Paris, 1905, N. S., II, 325-329.) R&amp;- sum6s papers on geographical and colo- nial history read at the Fourteenth Inter- national Congress of Americanists at Stuttgart, 1904. van Gennep (A.) Notes sur l'h6raldisa- tion de la marque de propriWt6 et les ori- gines du blason. (Bull. Soc. d' Anthr. de Paris, 1905, ye s., VI, 103-112, 23 fgs. ) Discusses the heraldization of property- marks. The Hausemarke and Hof- marke (German), the Russian kleimno, Turco-Egyptian tamga, Arabic wasm, Japanese shirushi, etc., are considered. The blason is of polygenetic origin. Prop- erty-marks develop, with social classes, into armorial bearing and heraldic bla- zonry. Guyot (T.) La population et les sub- sistances. (Ibid., I67-182.) Treats of the "ideal ration," vegetable ration in France, meat ration in France and England, the world's meat food, rela- tions of population and food. The author 171</page><page sequence="2">172 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 8, I906 concludes that the production of grain and meat in the world is inferior to the necessary ration as determined by the physiologists, and that many who need a reparative nutrition have to put up with an insufficient one. Hellwig (A.) Aberglaube und Strafrecht. (Unterhltgsbeil. z. Tagl. Rdschau., Berlin, 1905, Nr. 220, 877-879.) Dis- cusses briefly "superstitious crimes," such as injury to property or objects of various sorts (animals, trees, etc. ), done with a view to transfer or get rid of dis- ease or the like; injuries to the body or its organs, "to drive out the devil," to cure diseases, etc. ; killing a man to ob- tain his blood or some other part of him for "curative" purposes; mutila- tion of corpses through "vampire-be- liefs" ; the main de gloire. Perjury also stands in a peculiar relation to super- stition. Umfrage iiber kriminelle Aberglau- ben. (Z. f. d. ges. Strafrechtsw. Ber- lin, 1905-6, xxvI, 335-338.) Con- tains questionnaire of 13 items relating to superstitions of and about criminals and crime. The subject of superstition and crime has also been treated by L6w- enstimm, in the Zeitschrift f. Socialwis- senschaft (1903, 209-231, 273-286) and in his Aberglaube und Strafrecht (Ber- lin, 1897). Hutchinson (W.) The weapons and tools of the dog. (Open Ct., Chicago, 1905, xlx, 205-226, 15 fgs.). Author argues that " the main thing a dog is built for is to carry about and 'Ibackup' his teeth," but it is the dog's great-great-grand- father, the wolf, who can do really ar- tistic things with his teeth. The differ- ent breeds of dogs " have had their orig- inal wolf set of teeth modified by the way in which they have been selected and bred for a particular ' trade.' " Jbrger (J.) Die Familie Zero. (A. f. Rassen- u. Ges.-Biol., Berlin, 1905, II, 494-559. ) This interesting and valuable monograph, with many tables, treats of the family of the Zeros, - the remote an- cestor was a mill-owner in 1639, - and their product in individuals afflicted with vagabondism, alcoholism, crime, immo- rality, mental diseases, pauperism. The tendency to vagabondism is said to be due to marriage with " foreign '" women. The paternal character was destroyed by unions of German mountaineers and Italian tinkers and "homeless" people. A vocabulary of the language (German dialect) still used by the Zeros is ap- pended. Kahle (B.) Der gefesselte Riese. '(A. f. Religsw., Lpzg, 1905, vIII, 314-316.) Treats of the idea of the "chained giant" in the mythology of certain peo- ples of the Caucasus. R6sum6s An- holm's Den bundne Jftte i Kaukasus in the Danska Studier for 1904. Keller (C.) Die Mutationstheorie von de Vries im Lichte der Haustier-Geschichte. (A. f. Rassen- u. Ges.-Biol., Berlin, 1905, 11, 1-I9.) K. argues that there is no sharp boundary between natural and artificial selection, the latter being only a specially developed type of the former. As a rule the domestication of animals has taken place by the accumu- lation of small variations (Darwin), and only quite exceptionally by means of striking mutations (de Vries). Things in free nature occur in about the same way as in man's "artificial" selection. K. cites, e. g., the history of the East African Acacia fistula, hermit crab, the sheep, cattle, dog, etc. Kollman (J.) Ueber Rassengehirne. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1905, xxxvlI, 601-602. ) Note on the investigation of four Fuegian brains by Jacob (see Ameri- canAnthropologist, 1905, N. s., VII, 562). Dr K. observes that the results of Dr Jakob agree with those of Seitz and Man- ouvrier, affording additional evidence that " all nations, termed to-day civilized, ex- hibit and have exhibited for 2,000 years, the same quality of brain as the Fugians." - Ueber Rassengehirne. II. (Ibid. 758-759.) Note on recent description of the brain of a Papuan from the south coast of Dutch New Guinea by Bolk in Petrus Kamper. Kuhlenbeck (L.) Zur Kritik des Rassen- problems. (A. f. Rassen- u. Ges.- Biol., Berlin, 1905, 11, 560-567.) Crit- ique of recent article by Dr L. Stein in Die Zukunft. Lejeune (C.) La place de l'homme dans l'univers et dans la s~rie zoologique. (Bull. Soc. d' Anthr. de Paris, 1905, v0 s., vI, 183-194.) R6sum6s and dis- cusses the arguments of A. R. Wallace's Man's Place in the Universe and M. R6n6 Quinton's L'Eau de mer, Milieu organique, the first of which seeks to ele- vate the position of man in the universe by making earth its center, the latter to lower it, by making him not the last and highest member of the zoological series, but a species that appeared before the</page><page sequence="3">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 173 carnivora and the ungulates. The birds according to M. Quinton are posterior and organically superior to the mammi. fers. Lissauer (A.) Ueber den ersten Interna- tionalen Archltologen-Kongress in Athen von 7-13. April 1905. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1905, XXXVII, 537-546.) R&amp;- sum6s papers, etc., particularly that of D6rpfeld on cremation and burial of the dead in ancient Greece (cremation and then burial was the custom from prehis- toric times to the Christian era ; Ho- meric literature belongs to the younger Mycenaean epoch), and others by Evans, Montelius, etc. Manouvrier (L.) L' Anthropologie A l' Ex- position de Saint-Louis (U. S. A.) en I904. (R. de l'tc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1905, xv, 231-256.) Brief account of anthropology at the St. Louis Exposition - exhibit of Bureau of American Eth- nology, Section of Physical Anthropology and Laboratory, Indian Schools exhibi- tion, Congress of Arts and Sciences, etc. Meisner (H.) Isocephalie und Degenera- tion. (A. f. Rassen- u. Ges.-Biol., Berlin, 1905, II, 76-85.) Argues against the views of Waldenburg (in his disser- tation on Das isocephale Rassens ele- ment unter Halligfriesen und jiadischen Taubstummen) that the presence of a high degree of shortheadedness (hyper- brachycephaly and isocephaly) in modern blonds is a sign of degeneration, and that deaf-mutism and mental diseases stand in a certain relation thereto. Statistics do not bear out W.'s opinion. Montelius (0.) The evolution of the lotus ornament. (Rep. Brit. Ass. Adv. Sci., Lond., 1904 [1905], LXXIV, 700.) Brief notes on lotus ornament in Egypt, Assyria, Cyprus, Greece. In Greece lotus becomes common only in first mil- lenium B. c., although known in My- cenman times. The palmette and "Ion- ian capital " go back to the lotus. Newell (W. W.) In Memoriam: Wash- ington Matthews. (J. Amer. Folk-Lore, Boston, 1905, xvIII, 245-247.) Brief account of life, 1843-1905, and scientific activities, publications, etc., personal character. Dr M. " was poet as well as artist." Abiography by C. F. Lummis is in preparation. Northup (C. S.) A bibliography of com- parative literature. (Mod. Lang. Notes, Balt., 1905, xx, 235-239.) Critical review, with corrections and numerous additions, of Baldensperger's new edition (Strassburg, 1904) of Betz's La littir- ature comparle ; essai bibliographique. Peet ( S. D.) The story of the temptation, or the contest between good and evil. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 1905, xxvII, 139-152, 8 fgs.) Treats this theme as representedin the Hebrew scriptures, the Orient, America (Iroquois, Aztecs, Mayas, etc. ). - The story of the deluge. (Ibid., 201-216, 5 fgs.) Refers to deluge legends of ancient Semites, Greeks, Chinese, Hindus, American Indians (Algonquians, Navahos, Aztecs, etc.) The views of Prof. Suess are reported at some length. - Ancient alphabets and sacred books (Ibid., 265-280, 8 fgs.) Treats of cuneiform writing, Egyptian hieroglyph- ics, the alphabet and history, etc. - Spear-heads, knives, stone axes, and other edged tools. (Ibid., 297-304, 3 pl., I fg.). General discussion of flint implements, grooved axes, etc. - The boomerang and the bow and arrow. (Ibid., 233-250, 2 pl. 6 fgs.) Discusses generally the bow and arrow, the harpoon, with references to Tylor, Holmes, Mason. Prinzing (F.) Die kleinere Sterblichkeit des weiblichen Geschlechts in den Kul- turstaaten und ihre Ursachen. (A. f. Rassen- u. Ges.-Biol., Berlin, 1905, II, 253-266, 369-382.) The proportion of women to Iooo men in the various Euro- pean states ranges from 893 in Bosnia to logo in Portugal, averaging 1025. The female mortality is in almost all these countries lower than the male. The smaller mortality is conditioned by the smaller dangers to the life of woman during the period 15-4o years and in old age. In the period 5-15 years tubercu- losis raises the death-rate and in the period 15-20 years the effects of civil- ization are perceptible. Reinach (S.) Le serpent et la femme. (L'Anthropologie, Paris, 1905, xvI, 178-I8o.) Author seeks to explain the " enmity between the serpent and the woman " (Gen. iii) by reference to the belief current in various regions of the primitive world (and recently reported from Portugal) that the menstrual flow is the result of the bite of a serpent. The heel of the Biblical narrative is euphemistic. Sastri (K. S. R.) Shakespeare and the Indian drama. (Educ. Rev., Madras, 1905, xI, 388-402.) Treats of develop-</page><page sequence="4">174 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 8, 1906 ment of Hindu drama in comparison with Greek and Shakespearean. Hindus have no tragedy; Hindu " fool " of lower type. Imitation of Shakespeare needed in development of plot, fusion of comic and serious, etc. Schallmayer (W.) Die soziologische Be- deutung des Nachwuchses der Begab- teren und die psychische Vererbung. (A. f. Rassen- u. Ges.-Biol., Berlin, 1905, II, 36-75.) Discusses recent theories and investigations, particularly those of Sombart and Steinmetz concern- ing the size of the families of the more talented classes of the population, the social significance of their posterity, etc. S. thinks that the noticeable reduced fer- tility (in the well-to-do and the talented classes) is partly involuntary,- sexual diseases are more hurtful here than with the less talented and less wealthy. Bodily and mental heredity may exist, without, e. g., as Odin points out, genius or talent (i. e., special mental construc- tions) being inherited. S6billot (P.) M. Girard de Rialle. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1905, ve s., VI, 149-150.) Brief sketch of scientific activities of the French ethnog rapher and folklorist. His brain and skull were left to the Society. Siffre (A.) Les caract&amp;res de la dent car- nivore chez l'homme et les anthropoides. (R. de l'Pc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1905, xv, 137-149, 18 fgs.) Treats of the ori- gin and nature of the human teeth (man has 8 heterodont groups) in comparison with those of the anthropoids. The differences in the form of the temporary and the permanent organs may represent stages of evolution. Velde (-) Rachitische Bildung des Schidels. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1905, xxxvII, 619-620.) Note on an indi- vidual with very marked rachitic skull and other characters. Virchow (H.) Zwei Photos eines durch Formalin - Alkoholgemisch injizierten Kopfes mit praiparierter Gesichtsmuskula- tur. (Ibid., 620-622.) Brief descrip- tion of a head so prepared as to retain the physiognomic minutiae and permit comparison with muscular forms. - Einen Kopf, der zur Hailfte aus dem SchaSdel, zur Hailfte aus der Gesichts- maske besteht. (Ibid., 781-785, 2 fgs.) By median section one half of the face of the head described in previous paper was removed, so that the head at present exhibits the natural outlines of the face on one side and of the bones on the other. V. points out the advantages of this disposition for the reconstruction of the faces of historical personages from the skull, if preserved, and from paint- ings, - the inaccuracies of the artist can thus be corrected. Also faces of primi- tive peoples. Vorobieff (V. V.) The degenerate ear. Anatomo-anthropological sketch. (J. of Ment. Path., N. Y., 1905, VII, 57-75.) R6sum6s previous investigations and gives results of own. Bibliography of 30 titles. See American Anthropolo- gist, 1902, N. S., IV, 767. W. (R.) Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings. (Educ. Rev., Madras, 1905, XI, 356-358.) Notes on the lan- guage of a boy up to his third year. A few "original words" are noted; also grammatical peculiarities, etc. Weinberg (R.) Zur Theorie einer ana- tomischen Rassensystematik. (A. f. Rassen- u. Ges.-Biol., Berlin, 1905, II., 198-214.) Discusses and criticises par- ticularly the systematic attempt of Ivan- ovski's (see American Anthropologist, 1905, N. S., VII, 547) attempt to arrange and classify the data available for a num- ber of anthropological characters of the population of Russia (color of hair and eyes, stature, length of head, cephalic index, height index, facial index, cheek- bones index, nasal index, length of face, length of trunk, chest-circumference, arm-length, length of leg). There are objections to the use of the so-called " difference-unity" as a rule of com- parison for diverse peoples. Wood (F. A.) The origin of color-names. (Mod. Lang. Notes, Balt., 1905, xx, 225-229.) Discusses various ways in which color-names arise,- " they are always transferred terms, and, in the old color-names at least, usually come from the restricted use of various descriptive terms," and "the color denoted de- pends upon association, not upon any inherent meaning in the word itself." The article r6sumes part of the author's Color-names and their Congeners (Halle, 1902). EUROPE Bandi (E.) Volkstiimliche Handwerks- kunst undb~urische Zierformen. (Schw. A. f. Volksk., Ztirich, 1905, IX, 243-250, 5 pl., 2 fgs.) Treats of the pottery and stone-ware of the Swiss peasants, their</page><page sequence="5">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 175 ornamentation, inscriptions, etc., particu- larly in Aargau. The crockery of Lang- nau is the richest in decoration; that of Heimberg is simpler. The new pottery does not compare wlth the old and the new ornamentation lacks character. Baudouin (M.) D6couverte d'un menhir tomb6 sous les dunes et d'une station gallo-romaine aux Chaumes de St. Hilaire de Riez, Vendde. (Bull. Soc. d'An- throp. de Paris, 1905, ve s., vI, 125- 134, 3 fgs.) Detailed description of a flat menhir covered with sand at a place called Creux d'Argent (legend has it that a treasure is hidden here), its situ- ation, etc. Dr B. considers that this stone is not " an erratic block," conveyed naturally, -but a block from the Cennu- anian sands, coming from outside of Chaumes. Bouchet ( - ) Les sepultures de l'Age du bronze de la grotte de Courchapon, Doubs. (L'Anthropologie, Paris, 1905, xvI, 309-316, 4 fgs.) Describes with measurements, 4 crania (indices 68.39, 78.82, 75.70, 77.96) from the grotto of Courchapon, belonging to the end of the bronze age, in the valley of the Ognon, Doubs. The cranial capacity is rather small. Affinity with the dolichochephals of the bronze age in the Rhine valley, southern Germany and Switzerland, is indicated. Boule (M.) Les grottes des Baousses- Rouss6s. (Ibid., 503-506.) Notes on the chronology of the Grotto of the Prince, near Mentone, and on the age of the human skeletons from the Mentone grottos. According to B. the human remains from these caves belong to all periods of the Quaternary - the negroid skeletons go back to the epoch of the oldest Quaternary fauna. L'origine des 6olithes. (Ibid., 257- 267, 15 fgs.) B. cites evidence to show how flints identical with so-called "ieoliths " may be produced by the sim- ple play of physical forces, as e. g., at Mantes. Some of the eoliths may have received their present form from the processes of their extraction by excava- tors. B. believes in the existence of Ter- tiary man; the proof will turn up some- where some time. Branger (E.) Verordnungen tiber das Bad Pfafers vom Jahr 1603. (Schw. A. f. Volksk., Ziirich, 1905, IX, 150-154.) Publishes the regulations of the Pfafers free bath issued by the Abbot Michael in 1603. Breuil (H.) Nouvelles figurations du mammouth grav6s sur os a propos d'objects d'art decouverts a St. Mihiel, Meuse. (R. de l'fc. d' Anthr. de Paris, 1905, xv, 150-155, 9 fgs.) De- scribes new engravings of the mammoth (or parts) or bones from the " shelter" of Roche-Plate near St. Mihiel. Flints were not numerous (several atypic). Bones and teeth of reindeer, horse, ox, goat (?) were found-those of the deer and larger animals were absent. Har- poons and needles also were lacking. This "shelter" belongs probably to a period earlier than the last epoch of the reindeer age. .- L'Age du bronze dans le bassin de Paris. (L'Anthropologie, Paris, 1905, XVI, 149-171, II fgs.) Treats of bronze axes from the basin of the river Somme, of which there are recognized four types (flat, straight-edged, "heeled," and winged). The rarest are the flat. The oldest types of metal axes are absent or are exceptional in Picardy. Busse ( -) Das BrandgrLberfeld bei Wil- helmsau, Kreis Nieder-Barnim. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1905, xxxvII, 569-591, 33 fg.) Describes briefly the contents (weapons, implements and utensils, orna- ments, etc., metal objects, etc.) of 55 graves in the cremation-cemetery of Wilhelmsau, investigated 19oI-I9o4. These remains represent a Teutonic people of the third to the fourth century B. c. The pottery is essentially different from that of the La T~ne and Hallstatt age. Noteworthy are a terra nigra vessel with a relief-frieze and a silver double- roll fibula. See Kossinna, Lissauer. Capitan (L.) Les deux conferences de M. le Dr Capitan, a Bordeaux. Analyse par 1' Abb6 Brun. (Soc. Arch. de Bordeaux, 1903, XXXIV, 94-10o8.) R6sum6 of two addresses by Dr Capitan before the Archeological Society of Bordeaux on "The ethnographic method applied to the study of the drawings and paintings in the prehistoric grottos of Aquitaine."

Marsonlas, pros Salies- du-Salat, Haute Garonne. (Ibid., 431- 444, Io fgs.) Treats of the animal fig- ures (goat, horse, etc.,) engraved and painted, tectiform, pectiform signs, arbor- escent figures, groups of points, cross, etc., on the walls of the cavern of Mar- sonlas. There are about a dozen rude sketches of human heads. At Marsonlas there are three distinct "pictorial layers," - black animal figures ; polychrome ani- mal figures with tectiforms and hands, enigmatic red figures, crosses and branchy bands. One painting with tectiform, arborescent, and punctillated figures is remarkable. Cunningham (D.), Gray (J.), etal. An- thropometric investigation in Great Britain and Ireland. Report of Com- mittee.

Appended are brief notes on the pigmentation survey of the school children of Scotland carried out in 1903 by school teachers; Shrubsall's study of the physical characters of London hos- pital patients; measurements of the in- mates of Scotch lunatic asylums (Tocher) ; measurements of Aberdeenshire and Glasgow school children (Tocher) ; measurements of Dorsetshire peasants (Gray). Daleau (F.) et Manfras (t.) Le dolmen du Terrier de Cabut, Commune d'An- glade, Gironde. (Soc. Arch. de Bor- deaux, 1904, xxV, 84-91 3 pl.) De- scribes briefly the finds - metal objects (bronze dagger-blade, bronze frag- ments), objects of bone ( '' amulet," bone bead, pins, ornaments), limestone beads, necklace of shell beads, and numerous similar shell objects, pottery (resembling ordinary French neolithic), etc., at the dolmen of Terrier de Cabut, assigned to the Morgian epoch. D6chelette (J.) Les perles de verre. ( L' Anthropologie, Paris, 1905, xvI, 173-177, 2 fgs.) Risumbs the second part of article by Reinicke on Glasper- len vorrimischer Zeiten aus Funden nirdlich der Alfjen, published in Altertii- mer unserer heidnischen Vorzeit (Mainz, I9o4, v, 60-72). Glass-making is of late origin in Europe and the beads discussed by Reinecke are of Mediterra- nean importation. Les petits bronzes ib~riques. (Ibid., 29-40, 6 fgs.) Discusses some of the material published by M. Pierre, Paris, in his Essai sur l'Art et l'Industrie de I'Efspyanefprimitive (Paris, 1903-1904, 2 vols.), - the small bronzes, jewels, implements, and instruments of divers sorts, of Iberic origin (fibulae in particu- lar). D. concludes that the evidence shows that ''in proto-historic Spain there was a sort of local school of sculpture, which, while receiving inspiration from Greeco-Oriental models, succeeded, in spite of awkward execution, in giving its works certain undeniably original char- acter." In industrial art the prototypes were Upper Italian rather than Greek or Carthaginian. Deubner (L.) O. Basener, Ludi secu- lares. (A. f. Religsw., Lpzg., 1905, vIii, 310-314.) R6sum6s O. Basiner's Ludi seculares. Drevnyerimskiya ssye- kulyarnyya igry (Warsaw, 1901, pp. cxv, 326), treating of the origin and history of the so-called ludi saculares of the ancient Romans, their relations to the Gentile cult of the Valerii. Evans (A. J.) Excavations at Knossos, Crete, 1904. (Rep. Brit. Ass. Adv. Sci., Lond., 1904 [1905], 322-324.) Re- ports briefly explorations of floor-levels, etc., within palace area, tracing of Mi- n6an roadway, discovery of cemetery north of palace, and sepulchral chamber farther north. Wall-paintings, great pithoi, inscribed clay tablets, painted ware, bronze objects, Egyptian alabas- tra, etc., were found. Evans (A. J. ), Myers (J. L. ), et al. Ex- cavations on Roman sites in Britain. (Ibid., 337-339.) Describes briefly ex- cavations at Silchester and Caerwent, 1903-1904; detailed accounts will ap- pear in Archeologia. At Silchester the remains of the principal bath of the Roman town were discovered; and at Caerwent the south gate and the base of a statue dedicated to Mars (date 152 A. D.). Fiirtwangler (A.)

The picture is valu- able as being a good half-century older than the earliest hitherto known repre- sentations of Charon. It would appear also that Charon was a genuine primitive figure in old folk-thought and not the late creation of a poet. Keller (C.) Le poulpe de l'allee cou- verte du Lufang, Morbihan. (R. de l'Ec. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1905, xv, 239- 243, 7 fgs. ) Describes the figure of the octopus carved on the third support of the left of the covered way of Lufang in Morbihan. This prehistoric figure is compared with representations of the oc- topus on Mycenoean vessels and other objects. Kossinna (A.) Ueber das Brandgruben- griiberfeld von Wilhelmsau. ( Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1905, xxxvII, 596-599, 5 fgs.) Describes some characteristic East Germanic objects (clay vessel, dag- ger-knife, iron knife, iron key, etc.). Neither the double-roll fibula nor the terra-nigra vessel with frieze is unique. See Busse; Lissauer. Krause (E.) Ueber die Exkursion der Gesellschaft am 28. Juni nach Riiders- dorf. (Ibid., 783-785, 2 fgs. ) Describes briefly some urns from the graves near the lake of Steinitz, and excavations made. Ueber Mord- und Siihnekreuze. (Ibid., 618-619.) Cites evidence to show that stone-crosses in the highway related to murder and then penance. Some zo instances are referred to. Lehmann (W.) Ueber eine lapplandische Zaubertrommel. (Ibid., 620.) Noteon a drum formerly in possession of Olaus Wormius, and noteworthy as being per- fect in all respects. Lissauer (A.) Ueber die Bedeutung des Grtiberfeldes von Wilhelmsau f'ir die Kenntniss des Handelsverkehrs in der V61kerwanderungsperiode. (Ibid., 591- 596, 2 fgs.) According to L., the re- mains of Wilhelmsau indicate the exten- sion of West Gallic trade-relations over the Elbe to the Spree, and of East Hun- garian over Silesia and Brandenburg northward. The vessel with ornamental frieze dates from (latest) the end of the third century. A distribution-map for bronze kettles and sigillata vessels with relief is appended. See Busse; Kossinna. Die Doppelixte der Kupferzeit im westlichen Europa. (Ibid., 519- AM. ANTH., N. S., 7.-12 525, 2 fgs.) Describes briefly I8 cop- per "double axes" (hole in middle, blade at each end) from various parts of Germany (I5), France (2), Switzerland (I). L. considers that these "double axes" were not weapon or implements, but imported axes from the southeast (Cyprus) - in the early metal-age cop- per bars in the form of "double axes" were brought into western Europe. The adornment of some of them indicates their appreciation. Die Doppelitxt aus Kupfer von Pyr- mont. (Ibid., 770-772, I fg.) De- scribes, with results of chemical analysis, a " double axe" of copper (pure prac- tically) found in 19oo near Pyrmont. L. considers that the analysis confirms the view that these West-European " double axes" belong to the earliest metal bars coming from Cyprus into Europe. Luchsinger (C.) Das Molkereigeriit in den Alpendialekten der romanischen Schweiz. (Schw. A. f. Volksk., Ziirich, 1905, IX, 177-186, 251-291, 33 fgs.) This excellent monograph, with word- index and bibliography of some 70 titles, treats in general and in particular of the various instruments, implements, and utensils employed in the milk industry; their names (etymology, etc.), etc., in the Alp dialects of Romance Switzer- land. Some 30 ideas are expressed by 195 words (150 of different roots, - 66 percent Teutonic, II percent Latin). Mahoudeau (P. G.) Documents pour servir l'ethnologie de la Corse. (R. de 1'c. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1905, xv, 165-184.) Gives results of head-meas- urements of 354 individuals from various parts of Corsica (mountainous central region, Niolo ; region about Corte, etc.). Both brachycephals and dolichocephals are old in Corsica, but the latter were probably the original type, tending to- ward mesaticephalism. In Corsica, as in France, the Pleistocene man of Cro- Magnon has been transformed into a modern race. Meier (S.) VolkstiimlicheS aus dem Frei- und Kelleramt. (Schw. A. f.

Brief account of the tumuli of the bronze age and the first iron age in various parts of France, their contents, etc. The Hallstatt period has been styled the "tumulus epoch." The large dolmenic tumuli of Brittany seem to have been the sepultures of powerful men, of the higher classes, etc. Sepulchral tu- muli of the middle bronze age are rare.

Sixth report of the com- mittee. (Rep. Brit. Asso. Adv. Sci., Lond., 1904 [19051, 324-330, I fg.) Brief account of investigations in the spring of 1904 of mounds 57, 58, 78, 79, 55, 54, 51, 53, 64, and some under- taken in 1902. A list of objects (amber, glass, tin, bronze, iron, shale, animal and human bones, tusk, baked clay, flint, antler, stone, spindle, whorls, querns, pottery, etc.) found is appended. Obermaier (H.) La station palolithique de Krapina. (L'Anthropologie, Paris, 1905, XVI, 13-27, 2 fgs.) Describes situation, stratification, etc., and com- pares the "station" of Krapina with others (Taubach, Shipka, Certovadira, Wierzchow) of the lower paleolithic age in Central Europe, the paleolithic in France, etc. 0., who has visited Kra- pina, considers that the race there repre- sented was " tall, with no real pithecoid traits," and differed from the man of Spy in having a high forehead and being hyperdolichocephalic. Les restes humains quaternaires dans 1'Europe centrale. (Ibid., 385-410.) R6sum6s data (genuine and doubtful) con- cerning human remains of the Quaternary period in Austria-Hungary. Among the surely Quaternary remains are those from the Shipka cavern, Krapina cavern, " stations" of Willendorf, Predmost, Brunn, Gudenus cavern, etc. As more or less doubtful are listed the iremains from Zuzlawitz, Ji-in, Prokopi; the skulls from Bruex, Podbaba, Lieben, and Strebichovic; remains from Roter Berg, Schlappanitz, and Hussowitz (all near Briinn) ; remains from the caverns of Kostelik, Bycilkala, JaEhymka, Lautsch, Balcarova-skala. It appears that no real Quaternary human remains have so far been proved to occur in Hungary, Upper and Lower Austria (except Gudenus), or the littoral. de Paniagua (A.)

Piette (E.). Les 6critures de l'tge glyp- tique. (L'Anthropologie, Paris, 1905, xvI, 1-1I, II figs.) Discusses the "in- scriptions " of Lourdes, Arudy, Gourdan, Madeleine Rochebertier, etc., according to P., "the oldest known writing." In the reindeer age there were successively in use two sorts of writing, pictographic (Papalian epoch) and cursive (Gourdan- ian epoch). Some of the symbols and characters belong evidently to the com- mon fonds of the Mediterranean cultures. P. regards it as proved that in the "glyptic age" there existed in France, near the Pyrenees, "people having a symbolic (rather than hieroglyphic) writ- ing formed of pictographic characters."

Describes pierced stones set up in the Tatar cemetery of Beiram-dede, and compares them with similar objects in westernEurope. Dr P. suggests that the passing of infants through the holes in such stones many have been " a second birth,"- the sick child was reborn well. The hole in the stone represented the maternal opening through which the child came into the world. Poirot (J.) Recherches experimentales sur le dialect lapon d'Inari. (Finn.- Ugr.

Discusses the early Christian "Hymn of the Soul," in the Acts of St Thomas, and a song of the Manichaeans, recently discovered in MS. in Turkestan, both of which are treat- ments, more or less, of the motif re- vealed in the abbreviated myth (" I am a king's son," etc.) found in the wound- charm contained in the London-Leyden old Egyptian demotic magical papyrus, published by Griffith in 1904. The Egyptian myth seems the model for the early Christian hymn. Rossat (A.) Les paniers, podme patois (Schw. A. f. Volksk., Ziirich, 1905, IX, 112-127, 224-237, 292-305.)

The Mullerey lake-dwellers of the stone age must have lived on rafts. The im- pressions of grains of cereals on pottery have revealed the species of these foods. Tumuli avoided swamps, followed an- cient roads, and led toward river-fords. The lur or trumpet of the bronze age can still be used for musical purposes. Schrader (P.) Le monde russe. (R. de l'Pc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1905, xv, 73- 85.) Sketches the development of Russia. Civilized Poland (politically extinct now, and socially more and more absorbed in Pan-Slavonia) and "bar- baric" Russia have long shared the great Oriental plain of Europe, whose cold climate retarded the growth of a sedentary civilization, but acted as a cer- tain unitary force. Contact between this great plain and Europe was gradually established by the Slavs. Muscovy, a sort of Asiatic march, semi-Asiatic itself, was the first political force of Russia, - cemented by the pressure of the Asiatic Tatars. In Siberia a new Russian cul- ture is arising, with more energy and less bonhomie than in Europe. Shrubsall (F. C.) A comparison of the physical characters of hospital pa- tients with those of healthy individuals from the same areas, with suggestions as to the influence of selection by disease on the constitution of city populations. (Rep. Brit. Ass. Adv. Sci., Lond., 1904 [I905], LXXIV, 702-704.) R6sum6s briefly results of investigations as to stat- ure, cephalic index, and pigmentation in London hospital patients. Adult pa- tients are fairer than the surrounding healthy population; children are much fairer than adults, and than healthy chil- dren. With passage of successive gener- ations from rural to urban, blonds feel more acutely change of environment. Stature also shows a progressive dimi- nution. Stengel (P.) 'Adqgy KXt7rocr70oo. (A. f.

This dog resembled in striking fashion the dingo of Australia. S. thinks that the dog of the European Quaternary exteriorly like the dingo, attached itself to savage man, was finally domesticated, and by crosses with the wolf became the ancestor of the large and ferocious breeds of European dogs.

Contribution a l'anthro- pologie physique de la Sicile 6n0olith- ique. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1905, ye s., vI, 196-199.) R6sum6s the article of Giuffrida-Ruggeri (see Ameri- can Anthropologist, 1905, N. S., vii, 336) on the human remains of the caves of Isnello and Chiusilla, near Cefalu, on the north coast of Sicily, belonging to the so-called " eneolithic " age. These Sicilian skulls resemble the ancient Egyp- tian in several respects. - Le commerce et les noms de I'ambre, anciennement. (R. de 1' F c. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1905, xv, 204- 208. ) In the neolithic age the use of amber was spread from the Vistula almost to the Black sea, and straying to Switzerland, but not in Italy at this epoch. The principal commercial route for am- ber was the Elbe; another was theVistula. Italy received its prehistoric amber from the Baltic in exchange for metal (gold, bronze). The ancient Assyrian term for "amber" signifies "saffron that at- tracts " ; Greek electron, was transferred from the name given to a composite metal of similar color; Latin succinum signified " resin " ; the old Teutonicglaesum (our glass is cognate) refers to its "shining" qualities, - the German Bernstein " in- flammable stone," is a recent manufac- ture; the Russian jantare is borrowed from Lithuanian ( cf. Tchermiss jan- dar, "Iglass "). In Finnish, as in Teu- tonic amber and glass are related by name. Z. considers that the Borussi imposed themselves upon a Finnish sub- strate. Zahler (H.)

Treats of the musculature of a negro of the Ubangi, who died in France in 1903, from sleep- ing sickness. There was present a greater (than in white) development of the muscles in the transverse direction and at the same time a shortening in the longitudinal (perhaps an individual character),- the subject was powerful rather than agile. The muscles were a deeper red than seen usually in the white man, and the subcutaneous fat a more pronounced golden yellow. Avelot (R.)

Le tatouage, les mutilations ethniques et la parure chez les popula- tions du Sudan. (L'Anthropologie, Paris, 1905, xvI, 129-I47, 14 fgs.) Discusses tattooing of several sorts, eth- nic deformations and mutilations (cran- ial, dental, aural, nasal, labial, circum- cision, and ornaments (necklaces, brace- lets, wristlets, anklets, etc.) among the Sudanese negroes. There are two dis- tinct types of tattooing, one reminiscent of combat, the other ornamental (the faces of the women do not rival those of the men, but their body and limbs often do so). Real cranial deformation is rare. Filing the teeth is common. The pierced ear- lobe bears all kinds of "ornaments." Lip-plugs abound. Finger-rings (a mark of the idle) are rare. - La chasse et l'agriculture chez les populations du Sudan. (Ibid., 456- 475, 6 fgs.) According to Dr D. the negro of the Soudan hunts for food, not for sport. Except in the case of the ele- phant and the hippopotamus, hunting is rather a quest after the young in nests and lairs - trapping and snaring are also in vogue, even the children trap birds, etc., those of the Chari especially. The effect of a hunting condition of existence is noted,-there is a continual tension of the senses. All negro agronomy is dominated by the habitat. The negro is practically at one with the face of nature ; he is not its master, as is man in agricul- tural Europe. The imperfection is not all due to natural laziness. Clearing land has been a difficult task. He has often reached the maximum to be obtained with the means at hand. To improve negro agriculture, one needs, not to at- tack the methods of cultivation, but to modify the cultivated products. Better seeds or better useful plants would mean more than better machinery of cultiva- tion. Fishberg (M.) Beitrdge zur physischen Anthropologie der nordafrikanischen Ju- den. (Z. f. Demogr. u.

At the epoch of Arab invasion the Laghouat region was occupied by tribes belonging to the great Berber confederation of the Magr' Aoua. It had several Roman appellations. The tomb of a celebrated marabout, Alssa, is here. Laghouat was concerned in the movement of Abd el Kader. The in- digenous population is composed of Arabs and Mzabite Berbers. The sed- entary Arabs are represented by the Ksunans, the nomad by the LarbAia. Leprince (M.) Notes sur les Mancagnes ou Brames. (L'Anthropologie, Paris, 1905, XVI, 57-65.) Treats briefly of physical characters (stature av. 1.65 m. ), dress and ornament, tatooing (done in adult age; not as caste-sign), dwell- ings (Portuguese influence), religion (fetishistic; oppose Islam, Catholicism, etc.), marriage, funerals (differ from neighboring peoples), social organization (chief ; no slavery), justice (chiefs aided by fetish-men), dances (mimic war; lascivious women's dance).

Brief report on anthropometric data (measurements of I,oo5 fellahin) of 1901-1902. Cop- tic population is shown to be more vari- able than Mohammedan. Modern popu- lation of Qena province, as compared with ancient Naqada, suggests that "the homogeneity of the Upper Egyptians has not been seriously disturbed during the last 7,000 years." No evidence of correlation between stature and cephalic index, or the infiltration of a taller race into Egypt. Monteil (C.) Consid6rations g6n6rales sur le nombre et la num6ration chez les Mand6s.

General discussion of the African ques- tion. The soul of the black is evolving, but "false humanity" on the part of Europeans leads him to infer feebleness. According to S. the beginning of philo- sophic wisdom, for white and black alike, lies in the respect for and consciousness of power. Verneau (R.) Note sur quelques cranes du 2e territoire militaire de 1'Afrique occidentale franqaise. (L'Anthropolo- gie, Paris, 1905, xvI, 41-56, 6 fgs.) Describes with tables of measurements 4 Lobi, 2 Bobo, and I Tiefo skulls (all but one male) from French West Africa. The Lobis are not a homogeneous group.

Religsw., Lpzg., 1905, vIiI, 286-304. ) Notes on literature of 1903- 1904 relating to Syrian and Ethiopian philology, mythology, religion, etc. Par- ticularly valuable are works of Dussaud in Syrian mythology, Budge's translation of Palladsui's Historia Lausiaca (320 A. D.). Buckley (E.) The Japanese as peers of Western peoples. (Amer. J. Sociol., Chicago, 1905, xI, 326-335.) Treats of physical characteristics, skill and in- dustry, invention and science, philos- ophy, art, moral faculty, religion. B. concludes that there can be no "yellow peril" in the case of Japan, "only an honorable rivalry, profitable alike to yellow and white." Japanese art (both fine and decorative), which has won world-recognition, "is an exclusively Mongolianproduct." Buddhist and Christian gospels. (Open Ct., Chicago, 1905, XIX, 538-546.) R6sum6s the work done by A. J. Ed- munds in comparative religion. His pamphlet on Buddhist and Christian Gospels was published in a second edi- tion in 1904. Many interesting parallels are adduced. Buffet (E. P.) A Buddhist in Jewry. (Ibid., 622-630.) Cites parallels to the philosophy of Gotama from the book of Ecclesiastes. Carus (P.) Assyrian poems on the im- mortality of the soul.

Critical review and resum6 of Andr6 de Paniagua's re- cent book, Les temps heroiques, in which the view is mistakenly set forth that India was the cradle of all human my- thology, and the mater gentium. Ghosen el Howie (Mrs) Excavations at Sidon. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 1905, XXVlI, 223-225.) Notes on the remains of the temple of the Phenician god Esh- mun. Inscriptions (possibly charms) were found on the hidden sides of the stones. de Gourmont (J.) L'id6e du retour 'ternel dans les religions de l'Inde. (Mercure de France, Paris, 1905, LVII, 338-356.) Author shows that the hypothesis of " the eternal recurrence of things," figuring so much in Nietzsche, - existing also in the so-called "platonic year " of German folk-lore, - goes back originally to the religions and philo- sophers of India; belongs with their cosmogonic ideas. Hawkins (C. J.) Excavations and the Bible. (Open Ct., Chicago, 1905, xIx, 1-7.) Cites evidence to show that Israel was not an isolated nation, but absorbed much from the vast old-world civilization preceding her. Herbertson (F. D.) Agricultural villages in the higher Himalayas. (Geogr. Teacher, Lond., 1905, 111, 23-27, 2 fgs. ) Treats briefly of villages in the Panj or upper Oxus valley described by Olufsen in his recently published Through the Unknown Pamir, the method of irri- gation, etc. In crossing streams the gupsar corresponding to the Mesopo- tamian inflated skin is in use. ten Kate (H.) Neue Mitteilungen iiber die blauen Geburtsflecken. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1905, xxxvII, 756- 758.) Notes occurrence in Tamil and Singhalese children in Ceylon, and cites item of Javanese folk-lore concerning toh, or skin-spot. The Singhalese name is upan happe, "birth spot." Ten K. reports that Ceylonese children, boys especially, have little of those child-like charms of face, etc., found in so many children of other colored races. Both in the Singhalese and Tamil adults the author noticed frequently a sort of pseudostupor. Ten Kate also finds the Dravidian to resemble strongly the Aus- tralian type. Kohler (W.) Die Schliissel des Petrus. Versuch einer religionsgeschichtlichen Erklarung von Matth. 16, 18, 19. (A. f. Religsw., Lpzg., 1905, vIII, 214-243. ) K. concludes that this famous passage of the New Testament is not a A6ytov KvptaKov, nor something taken over par- ticularly from Judaism to Christianity, but a transference from the antique world, - Mithraism is perhaps respon- sible for a good deal. Latham (H. L.) The views of Shinto re- vival scholars regarding ethics. (Open Ct., Chicago, 1905, XIX, 1oo, io6.) Cites extracts from Japanese scholars of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries concerning Chinese ethics, the Mikado, example and precept, offenses, punish- ment and rewards, fear of the gods, etc. von Luschan (F.')

Cites examples of the Semitic concept of earth as "mother of all," "mother of all living," etc. Also the Semitic corre- lation of terms for " seed," sperma, off- spring, e. g., the roots z-r and drw. Offord (J.) The biblical Nisroch and the Assyrian and Babylonian Nusku. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 1905, XXVII, 127-128.) Nusku was an important deity reported as worshiped by Sennacherib (II Kgs. XIx. 37), as "Nisroch, his god." The identification is doubted by some. Oppert (G.) Die Gottheiten der Indiert (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1905, xxxvII, 501-513, 717-754.) Treats of the cul. of the aborigines of India (the highest spirit, in Tamil Aiyandrs ; in Canarese, Ayyappa; the Dravidian Ellamma; the black goddess Kalamma or Kdli ; Mari- yammai or Mari; Visahari and Manasa, etc.). According to O. "on the whole the basal character of the Grdmadevata. has remained unchanged, although Brah- mans, Buddhists, Mohammedans and Christians have come in contact with it." Gramadevata ('' village deity "), a Sans- krit long-word, is the usual name for the local god. Phelps (M. H.) A representative Hindu. (Open Ct., Chicago, 1905, XIX, 438- 439.) An account of Hon. P. Raman- a'than, solicitor-general of Ceylon, now visiting America. Proctor (H.) Alphabetic origins. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 1905, xxvII, 128- 130.) R6sum6s recent articles of Petrie and Pitcher-the first considers that the Phenician alphabet is of non-hieroglyphic origin, the second believes that " alpha- betic characters owe their form to arbi- trary invention." P. thinks that the names were adopted from the sacred He- brew square alphabet, which may be "the very character in which the Deca- logue was written on the Two Tables of Stone by the ' Finger of God.' " The Bible and the Syrian archeol- ogy. (Ibid., 197-199.) R6sumbs part of V. Ermoni's pamphlet La Bible et l'Archkologie Assyrienne, treating of Adon, Baal, Shemesh, etc. J. Offord adds (199-200) some notes on Syrian places mentioned in the Tel-el-Amarna tablets, etc. Roux (P.) La prostitut6e japonaise au Tonkin. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1905, ve S., VI, 203-210.) Treats of methods of recruiting, distribution, so- matology, psychology, pathology, of the Japanese prostitute in Tonkin. Pauper- ism here, as elsewhere, lies at the basis of prostitution. The prostitutes are of ages from 14 to 30 (majority ca. 18), are small and not well built or well pro- portioned (the parts adjoining the gen- ital system are prominent). They can all read and write and are not at all devoid of sentiment, are very loyal to their native country. Venereal diseases are very common. Even in the midst of their vicious profession these women preserve something of virtue-" the lo- tus, with roots in the mud, can produce beautiful flowers" (Japanese). Note ethnographique sur les peu- plades du Haut-Tonkin, Ive territoire militaire. (Ibid., I55-156.) Treats of the Ounis, Pulas, Thai or Th6 (physical characters, intellect, religion and funeral rites, family, marriage, etc., foods and drinks, houses, industries, art, orna- ment), Nidns, Nhtings, Mans or Yhos, Meos of Upper Tonkin (fourth military district) numbering in all some 36,ooo,- the ThaY, NiAns, Mans, and Meos each count between 7000 and 8ooo. The writ- ten languages of the Ounis and NiAns employ Chinese characters. Several of the tribes write and speak Chinese. The Thais average I.6o m. in height and 53 k. in weight. They are intelligent, cour- ageous, honest, frank and good-natured. Although the That language is Siamese spoken and written, the Thais use Chi- nese characters in this region. The Thais are agriculturists and the arts are in a rudimentary state (pottery, e. g., comes from China or Annam). The NiAns and Nhuings are shorter than the Thais. The dress of the Meos and Mans is very curious. Both of these peoples burn the forest for planting. Schwally (F.)

Sternberg (L.) Die Religion der Gil- jaken. (Ibid., 244-274, 456-473.) This excellent article treats of cos- mogonic conceptions, ideas about ani- mals (especially bear and killer whale), deities (particularly gentile gods), the bear-feast and the ritual procedures ac- companying the killing of a bear, evil- spirits and shamanism, the fate of the soul. The Giliak is an animist, and for him man, the best known and most understood of all beings, is naturally the prototype, - every visible thing is merely a form in which hides a god, - a man. The religion of the Giliaks is a composite of pantheism, animal-cult, fetishism, de- monism, polytheism, etc., on a common substrate of anthropomorphism. Suzuki (T.) and Carus (P.) A religious book of China. (Open Ct., Chicago, 1905, xIX, 477-493.) Translation, with introduction and notes, of the T'ai Shang Kan Ying P'ien, or "The Treatise of the Exalted One on Response and Retribution," a work of Taoist piety and ethics (consisting of an introduction, moral injunctions, description of evil- doers and their penalty, sayings from various sources, conclusion). Velde (-) Eine Sammlung altchines- ischer Hieb- und Stichwaffen. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1905, xxxvII, 78-5 786.) Brief account of the collection of old Chinese weapons (lances, halberds, swords, daggers, battle-axes, blunt weap- ons of various sorts, "birds' claws," crescents, two-handed swords, etc.) in the Museum fiir V6lkerkunde, - ob- tained in Pekin in I898-I9oo00. There are many fanciful forms of swords. The handles indicate the small size of the hands of the Chinese. Virchow (H.) Weitere Mitteilungen fiber Fiisse von Chinesinnen. (Ibid., 546-568, 4 pl., 2 fgs.) Treats of the plaster-cast of foot of a thirty-year old woman (foot bound from sixth year), and X-ray pictures of the feet of two adult women and a girl of Io years, the Chinese shoe, etc. V. styles the Chi- nese foot pes equino - varo - calcaneus. The Manchu and Hakka women and the women of fisher-peoples do not bind the feet. Voirol (S.) Chez les Babis. (Mercure de France, Paris, 1905, LVIII, 523.) Describes a visit some three years ago to Abbas Effendi and to Abu-Chirazi, a celebrated theologian, who explained the teachings of Beha 'oullah, who gave new life to Babism. Warren (W. W.) Newest light on our oldest mother country. (Open Ct., Chi- cago, 1905, XIX, 568-572.) Discusses Aryan origins and particularly BMl Gan- gfdhar Tilak's recent work, The Arctic Home in the Vedas, in which the theory is put forth that "the ancestors of the Vedic Rishis lived in an Arctic home, in interglacial times."

Z. considers the Lolo physical type " sub-Caucasic," re- lated rather to the peoples of Assam, Burma, etc., than the Tibetan. The Lolos burn their dead and are monog- amous. The old Chinese records de- scribe them as they are to-day, the mass of the population of this region having long been Lolo. The Lolos form a solid block even now.

Ueber den Hausbau der Ja- bimleute an der Ostkiiste von Deutsch- Neuguinea. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1905, xxxvII, 514-518, 4 fgs.) De- scribes the construction of the ordinary house and the two-story lum (bachelor house; or assembly house) of the Jabim of Simbang in eastern German New Guinea. Houses are on piles, even on dry ground. The walls are adorned with figures of fishes and snakes; human and animal figures in relief and painted. Jabim house-building has some analogies with Malayan, - the view of von Lu- schan as to the relation between Malay and Melanesian house-building is con- firmed. Schellong (0.) Weitere Mitteilungen iiber die Papuas (Jabim) der Gegend des Finschhafens in Nordost Neu-Guinea, Kaiserwilhelmsland. (Ibid., 602-618.)

Describes hooks for bonito, sharks, murenae, attachment of line to hooks, manufacture of shell hooks, canoes and their outfit, implements, etc., in use for- merly among the inhabitants of Paumotu (Low Archip.). European manufac- tures have now driven out almost entirely the ancient native devices. Les marae des iles orientales de l'archipel des Tuamotu. (Ibid., 475- 484, 5 fgs.) Describes the mare, or altars, of the ancient natives of the islands of Niuhi or Fakalina (at Tahiti- nui, Katipa) and Fagatau (at Rama- pohia). There are also mare on the island of Napuka, but none on Puka- puka. These marca are numerous and each family has its own. They differ in type from those of Temoe and Marutea, in the southeast of the archipelago. The principal part of the marae is an oblong construction of piled stones. Thomas (N.'W.) Ueber Kulturkreise in Australien. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1905, xxxvII, 759-767, 2 fgs. ) Criticises the conclusions of Dr Gribner (See Amer- ican Anthropologist, 1905, N. S., VII, 720) with respect to culture areas in Australia, arguing for a bringing together of all data concerning the chief charac- ters of aboriginal culture rather than the imperfect consideration of a large num- ber of characters. T. points out that Roth, Spencer and Gillen deal with ter- ritory outside Gribner's so-called " West Papuan culture area." The change from maternal to paternal succession is not due to Papuan influence. Distribu- tion of canoes, knocking out of teeth, etc., are discussed. Descent is overesti- mated. AMERICA Adam (L.) Grammaire occawai. (J. Soc. d. Am6r. de Paris, 1905, N. s., II, 209-240.) Second section treating of the verb and its modifications.

(Intern. Quart., N. Y., 1905, xII, 157-173.) Illustrates historical development of mythology by citation and discussion of the Tlingit tale of the adventures of Nanak (i. e., the Russian explorer and trader Baranoff, 18oi), and of a sun-myth of the Comox Indians. The elements of a complex myth " ap- pear in endless combinations, partly in the tales of the tribe that owns the myth, partly in those of its neighbors." As to geographical distribution, "there has been liberal exchange all over the north- ern half of the continent," and " a cer- tain amount of interchange between the Old World and the New. " First efforts at explanation must be directed toward an interpretation of the reasons leading to borrowing, and to the modification of mythological material by assimilation. Anthropometry of central Califor- nia. (Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., N. Y., 1905, xvII, 347-380, 9 pl.) Treats material collected by Dr R. B. Dixon in 1899-19oo and by Mr V. K. Chesnut in 1892-1893. Measurements are given of 216 individuals (Maidu 60, Hat Creek and Pit River 8, Paiute I, Pomo 28, Yuki-Pomo, 2, Yuki 48, Wintun 2, Yokuts I, Wintun-Yuki I, Wylackie 2, half-breeds 12, Maidu half- breeds, I8, Pit River half-breeds 4, Pomo half-breeds 12, Yuki half-breeds 9, Wintun half-breeds 5, miscellaneous 3). The Yuki differ in type from all the neighboring tribes, being short (av. of males 1590 mm.), longer headed (av. ceph. ind., 77.5), with narrow and low faces. This type is also found among the Maidu of the foot hills (but disap- pears farther to N. and E.) and to a less extent among the Pomo. Among the Pomo and toward the interior a type (av. stat. of males I68o; ceph. ind., 83 ; av. width of face, 149) prevails a tribe resembling that of the Indians of the Nevada-Utah plains. The Pit River In- dians are excessively short-headed (pos- sibly due to head flattening). Dr B. sug- gests that the Yuki type may be related to the short-statured long-headed type of the ancient inhabitants of Sta Barbara island. A rapid reduction of the Indian population is in process. Borba (T. M.) Caingang deluge legend. (J. Amer. Folk-Lore, Boston, 1905, XVIII, 223-225.) Accounts for west- ward course of rivers, origin of monkeys, tigers, tapirs, ant-eaters, song and dance, size of feet of Indians, etc. English text of a legend published originally in Portuguese in the Revista do Museo Paulista, 1902. Conard (Laetitia M.) A visit to Quinault Indian graves. (Open Ct., Chicago, 1905, XIX, 737-744, 5 fgs.) Describes graves of Quinault and Queets Indians of Washington state, visited in 1902. They are houses of the dead rather than graves, and "the profuseness with which the graves are furnished with articles of luxury and use is quite in contrast with the meager furnishings of the houses of these Indians, which must be seriously dimin- ished when a member of a household dies." Traces of old Indian customs still survive. Curtis (W. E.) Education and morals among the Navajos and Pueblos. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 1905, xxvII, 259-264.) Reprinted from the Chicago Record-Herald for Aug. 12, 1905. Dis- cusses the effect of education, - "9the morals of the Pueblo Indians have always been high, but they were higher before the whites came." According to C. J. Crandall, superintendent of the Indian school at Santa F6, "the Navajos are much brighter and more ambitious than any other Indians and the Apaches are next to them." Diguet (L.)

Gives an account of author's examination of two funerary grottos or shelters at El Pescadero, near Cape Pulmo, southern California, their contents (7 skeletons, bone implements, etc.). In a cave near Santiago were found a woman's " apron," some wooden implements and objects ; besides the human remains. These burials be- longed probably to the Indians known as Pericus. Dorsey (G. A.) Caddo customs of child- hood. (J. Amer. Folk-Lore, Boston, 1905, xvIII, 226-228.)

Also the "teach- ing" of the child by grandmother or some old person when eight or ten, - child's preparation for dangers of travel to the other world. Doxson (C.) An Indian as a mechanic. (So. Wkmn., Hampton, Va., 1905, XXXIV, 503-505.) Relates experi- ences of author, an Onondaga, now a member of the labor union and one of the highest paid machinists in the shop. Fehlinger (H.) Das Einwanderungsprob- lem in den Vereinigten Staaten. (A. f. Rassen- u. Ges.-Biol., Berlin, 1905, II, 413-423.) Discusses statistics of Report of the Commissioner of Immigration for 19o04 and of the Twelfth Census. The effects of "good times" and "bad times" in the U. S. is marked less so than that of corresponding conditions in Europe. The most important change in the last decade is the drift of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe, in- stead of from the north and northwest. The most frequent intermarriages are those between born Americans and immi- grants from English Canada. Fletcher (A. C.) Preparation of Indians for citizenship. (So. Wkmn., Hampton, Va., 1905, XXXIV, 425-428.) There is "ample proof of the capacity of the Indian to become an enlightened citizen of the United States." The "agency system" and the reservation have not taught the Indian the real duties of citi- zenship or made the most of him for it. Schools and the establishment of the Indian court of offenses have brought about good results. France (J. J.) S udy and prevention of tuberculosis among colored people of Virginia. (Ibid., 494-498.) Discusses statistics ; argues that the negro's greater susceptibility to tuberculosis, like that of white women as compared with the white men, is largely due to urban indoor labor, insufficient food, scant clothing, etc. Manchester, Va., is alone in reporting a higher death rate from tuberculosis for whites (3.30 per thousand) than blacks (2.20). Golder (F. A.) Aleutian stories. (J. Amer. Folk-Lore, Boston, 1905, xvIII, 215-222.) English texts of 5 tales : The sad woman, the woman who was fond of intestines, the man and woman who be- came sea-otters, a sea-otter story, the brother and sister who became hair-seals. Hamy (E.-T.) Deux pierres d'?clair (pedras de corisco), de l'ttat de Minas- Gera~s, Br6sil. (J. Soc. d. Amer. de Paris, 1905, N. S., II, 323-325, I fg.) Describes two "thunder stones," - flint hatchets of the old Indians of Minas Geraas, found in digging a ditch at Los Tranqueros. Native superstition attri- butes to them an origin from lightning and thunder. Hrdlipka (A.) Diseases of the Indians, more especially of the southwest United States and northern Mexico. (Wash- ington Med., Ann., 1905, Iv, 372-394.) R6sumbs data to be published in a forth- coming Bulletin of the Bureau of Amer- ican Ethnology. Based on the author's personal observations during 6 expedi- tions, 1898-1905, among 38 groups or tribes of Indians, with the addition of facts from the reports, 1904-1905, of agency school physicians, etc., relating to 102 localities, and ca. 125,000 Indians (including some mixed bloods). Dr H. finds that, "on the whole, the health of the Southwestern and North Mexican un- civilized Indians is superior to that of the whites living in larger communities." The most unfavorable regions for the Indian are, at present, in the north, parts of Wisconsin, the Dakotas and Montana. Many interesting facts are given in this valuable paper concerning numerous diseases. Dr H. does not think pre-Columbian syphilis proved. Also, "in all probability, the proportion of the several main varieties of tubercu- losis is not much if any larger among the Indians as a whole than it is among the poorer classes of whites as a whole." In the discussion Drs Lamb, Kober, John- son, Morgan, and Gen. Forwood took part, and added facts from their own ob- servations. La Flesche (F.) The past life of the plains Indians. (So. Wkmn., Hampton, Va., 1905, XXXIV, 587-594.) Treats of agriculture, buffalo-hunt and prepara- tions for it, the "surround," prepara- tion of meat and hides, harvesting, making bows, arrows, lances (teaching boys) and other weapons, etc. Describes one phase of Omaha life in the past. de La Grasserie (R.) Renseignements sur les noms de parent6 dans plusieurs langues ambricaines. (J. Soc. d. Amer. de Paris, 1905, N. s., II, 333-338.)

These maps are valuable for the sites and names of Indian settlements, rivers, lakes, etc., and the variants in spelling. Lehmann (W.) Les peintures Mixteco- Zapoteques et quelques documents ap- parentes. (J. Soc. d. Am6r. de Paris, 1905, N. s., II, 241-280.) Lists with description, historical sketch, biblio- graphic references, the group of picture- writings dominated by the Codex Borgia and influenced by Zapotec culture (Co- dex Borgia, Codex Vaticanus B., Codex Cospi; Codex F6jerv.ry-Mayer, Codex Landa ; No. 20 of the Aubin collection) and picture-writing of Oaxaca, including Mixtec (Codex Becker No. I, Codex Columbinus, Codex Becker No. 2, Lienzo de Zacatepec, Lienzo de Amolte- pec, Lienzo Vischer No. I, Codex Yan- cuitan), Zapotec (Codex Vindebonen- sis, Codex Nuttall, Codex Bodleianus, Codex Selden No. I, Codex Waecker- Gotter, Codex Selden No. 2, Dorenberg Fragment, Codex Dehesa, Codex Bar- anda, Map of Tehuantepec, Lienzo de Huilotepec, Lienzo de Guevea, Lienzo de Santa Maria Chimalapa, Codex Alva- rado, Lienzo de Petapa), Cuicatec (Co- dex Porfirio Diaz, Codex Fernandez Leal , Mazatec (Lienzo Seler I), Cho- cho-Popoloca (Lienzo Seler II, Codex of Santa Catarina Texupan, Annals of Quecholac), Chinantec (Survey of Xochi- tepec, Survey of Muagnia), -35 Mss. in all. von Luschan ( F. ) Ueber ein Os supra- tympanicum beim Menschen.

Miller (K.) Surplus negro women. (So. Wkmn., Hampton, Va., 1905, XXXIV, 522-528.) In the U. S. negro women exceed men by 54,347 (or 13 per iooo). In 15 cities (of more than 20,000 negroes) the female excess is 59,091 (making the ratio of women to men I I8 to Ioo). In Chicago negro men exceed women in numbers. In Atlanta the ratio of women to men is 145 to 100. Train- ing for domestic service is one solution of the problem. Newton (E. E.) Impressions of the Navahos. (Ibid., 600-615.) Notes on experiences, etc., of wife of a school physician. The Navaho makes a good physical impression, is deeply supersti- tious, tenacious in adherence to the estab- lished order of things, an inveterate gambler, is hippophile and philocanine, is an excellent artisan, and possesses intelligence of a good order. His future lies in the education of his character. Peet (S. D.) Stone relics in California. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 1905, xxvII, 169-176, 3 fgs.) Based chiefly on Holmes, Anthropological Studies in California (Rep. U. S. ,Nat. Mus., 900oo). Refers also to Mercer's Ex- ploration of Durham Cave in 1893 (Publ. Univ. of Penn., I897). In the California province art in stone is practi- cally uniform at all points. Variations in local resources account largely for differ- ences existing. Rivet ( -) Les indiens Colorados. R6cit de voyage et 6tude ethnologique. (J. Soc. d. Am6r. de Paris, 1905, N. S., II, 177-208, 5 pl., I fg.) Treats of visit to the Colorado Indians of western Ecuador in 1903.

The Colorado is not idle per se, and he is in- telligent, and about his only vice is drunk- enness. Twenty years ago the Colo- rados numbered more than 70o; to-day 350, and alcoholism and small-pox are killing them off. Schenk (A.)

Ueber Gebriuche der Mit- telmesa-Hopi (Moqui) bei Namenge- bung, Heirat und Tod. (Ibid., 626- 636. ) Treats of the ceremonial clean- sing of the child and the name-giving (the ceremony lasts from an hour to an hour and a half) ; marriage and cere- monies connected therewith (usually 40 days) ; death and burial, etc., from ob- servations in the pueblos of Mishongnovi and Shipaulovi of the Tusayan (Moqui, or Hopi) stock. Stoddard (H. L.) Phallic symbols in America. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 1905, xxvII, 281-294, 8 fgs.) General discussion of the correlation of the solsti- tial and phallic symbols of America, to those found in Asia, Europe, and Africa. Reference is made to the "Yoni sym- bol " from Menard's mound, the altar at Copan, an idol from Nicaragua, etc. Author finds in America " Babylonian sun-dial and Teraphims." Stone age collection. (Narrag. Libr. Ass. Bull., Peace Dale, R. I., 1905, No. 2, 37-40, 7 pl.) Brief account of two flint scrapers from Mildenhall (Suf- folk), England; a flint spearpoint from Wisconsin; a rubbing-stone from An- trim, Ireland; six obsidian "razors " frorii Honduras; flint knife, gouge, and scraper from Denmark; a small collec- tion of fine chalcedony and varying flint arrowpoints from the beach at Santa Barbara, Cal. ; an Australian spalting tool of hard flint mounted in asphalt and a glass arrowhead made with it; two flint objects of uncertain use from California.

Gives items of super- stition from the Catarina Indians con- cerning Monequanish, "the enchanted land," an upland region in the San Pedro Martin range of Lower California. Also items of superstition relating to Tauquitz peak in S. California from the San Jacintos and Sabobas. Thorndike (T. W. ) A plea for the estab- lishment of a commercial game and fur preserve in the Northwest. (Rep. In- tern. Geogr. Congr., Wash., 19o4, VIII, 870-891.) Contains at pages 884-885 notes on the Indians (ca. 15,ooo) of " the north country," or "muskeg re- gion," south of Hudson Bay. The ad- mixture of white blood is very large, and the "breeds " outnumber the full- bloods, - the whites are mainly Scotch, with some French Canadians. The fu- ture welfare of the Indians depends on the preservation of the fur. The Cana- dian preservation system is superior to the American, but what is wanted every- where, for Indians, animals, land, is not reservation but preservation. Thouar (A.) En el pais del caucho. (An. de Instr. Prim., Montevideo, 1905, II, 883-889, 3 fgs. ) Treats of the Acre region of Brazil, - an india-rubber coun- try. Refers briefly to the Araonas and Tacanas. Translated from the French.

Carver, etc.) that the mounds on Dayton's bluff, in the eastern portion (Mounds Park) of the city of St Paul, were built for sepulture by the Sioux, partly in Carver's time (less than 150 years ago) and partly much earlier. Other mounds in Minnesota may also have been made by the Sioux (e. g., at Red Wing). Wake (C. S.) Asiatic ideas among the American Indians. (Ibid., 153-162, 189- 196.) By reference to ideas in Mazdaism, Mithraism, etc. (the "IGreat Medicine" of the Indians "answers somewhat to Mithra "; Persian fravashiism agrees with American Indian totemism; Arap- aho myths have content resembling Ori- ental, especially Mithraic legends ; American Indian "mystery" has analo- gies with Oriental), author seeks to es- tablish " contact between American and Asiatic ideas," but not successfully. Williamson (G.) Superstitions from Louisiana. (J. Amer. Folk-Lore, Bos- ton, 1905, xvIII, 229-230.)
