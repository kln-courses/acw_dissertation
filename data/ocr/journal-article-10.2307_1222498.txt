W.: Article 59: reinterpretation or revision? - Taxon 41: 91-98. 1992. - ISSN 0040-0262. Nomenclatural priority in pleomorphic fungi is regulated by Article 59 of the Code. We show that Article 59 can be interpreted in more than one way. By the broad interpretation in current use, the potential for pleomorphy is assumed of all fungi and the Article is applied to all fungi. Fungi without a demonstrated sexual state are classified in the form taxon, Deuteromycotina, until a sexual state is found. With an alternative and strict interpretation, however, Article 59 would apply only to fungal species that have been actually demonstrated to be pleomorphic. Under the latter interpretation, sexual, asexual, and pleomorphic fungi would be classified together and form taxa would not be necessary. Nucleic acid characters are being used in taxonomic and phylogenetic studies to com- pare Ascomycotina and Basidiomycotina with deuteromycetes (Gaudet &amp; al., 1989; Gu6ho &amp; al., 1989), and may even serve as all or part of the type element (Reynolds &amp; Taylor, 1991a). The use of nucleic acid sequence allows systematists to demonstrate the phylogenetic relatedness of fungi possessing and lacking meiotically produced spores. This demonstration presents a serious challenge to the separate classification of these two types of fungi and undermines the elevated position that characters associated with sexual reproduction have held in the classification of higher fungi, as well as phylogeny (Savile, 1955). We believe that all fungi should be classified in one system and that characters associated with sexual reproduction should be given the same weight as other characters. These ideas are at odds with the commonly accepted, broad (sensu lato) interpretation of the Code (Greuter &amp; al, 1988). Article 59 is the Code's provision for "Names of pleomorphic fungi"' Although Article 59 does not establish a dual system of nomenclature per se, it does require that the botanical (as opposed to anatomical, Hennebert &amp; Weresub, 1977) name of a fungus be based on a type element with a meiotic (i.e. teleomorphic) state present. Thus, Article 59 establishes sexual mor- phological characters as the basis of bona fide species and therefore classification in a botanical manner; mycologists have had to erect the deuteromycetes to classify fungi that have not been observed to express morphological characters of the meiotic state. Article 59 may also be interpreted narrowly (sensu stricto), a topic that we will focus on later in this discussion. Demonstration of meiosis is not an issue in all fungal groups: Chytridiomycotina, Zygomycotina and lichenized fungi that do not reproduce sexually are classified with those that do. Sexual characters have been made most important where they have been thought to be most useful - in Ascomycotina and Basidiomycotina. The elevation of importance of meiotic characters is a consequence of their utility, the long alliance of Natural History Museum, 900 Exposition Boulevard, Los Angeles, California 90007, U.S.A. 2 Department of Plant Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720, U.S.A.</page><page sequence="2">92 TAXON VOLUME 41 fungi with plants, and an anthropomorphic reflection rooted in the religious belief of a family unit (taxon) based on procreation, a concept which mirrors the social values of some 19th century mycologists (Reynolds, 1987). Having made sexual reproductive characters so important, it became necessary to separately classify fungi lacking them. The logical problem of excluding one group of fungi from botanical classification has been handled in two ways: (1) by claiming that the separation is a temporary measure until the cryptic meiotic states are inevitably found, and (2) by recognizing the dual system as biologically unrealistic but prac- tically necessary. The sex-dependent species concept in the current version of Article 59 was expressed as early as 1891 (Saccardo, 1891). The Article itself can be traced back to the Brussel Rules adopted by the International Botanical Congress of Brussels. Article 49bis of the Rules (Briquet &amp; al., 1912: 47) stated: "Among fungi with a pleomorphic life-cycle the different successive states of the same species (anamorphoses, status) can bear only one generic and specific name (binomial) that is the earliest which has been given ... to the state containing the form which it has been agreed to call the perfect form ... "The nomenclature of Fungi which have not a pleomorphic life-cycle follows the ordinary rules. "Examples. - ... The name Phoma Fries emend. Desm. has been given to a group of Fungi Imperfecti (Deuteromycetes) several members of which have been recognized as the spermogonial state of species of the genus Diaporthe ... But, the perfect state of many species of the 'genus' Phoma is not known and in some cases probably does not exist. Hence the practical necessity for retaining the name Phoma to designate the group of Fungi Imperfecti in question!' In addition to establishing the primacy of meiotic reproduction, this passage shows that the framers of the Rules recognized that some fungi lacked expression of the meiotic morph, but were willing to ignore this biological fact as a practical necessity. Arthur (1929) criticized the primacy of sexual characters in his treatise on Uredinales. "After the rusts were placed among the Basidiomycetes by Brefeld (1889) and this assignment endorsed by Van Tieghem (1893), the teliospore was accepted as the most significant of all the spores and nearly all subsequent classifications have been based upon it. So firmly has this understanding of its significance become fixed in the minds of mycologists and other botanists, that in the International Botanical Congress at Brussels in 1910 a majority vote established the questionable rule that 'generic and specific names given to other states [than the teleutosporic] have only a temporary value: The pycnia, aecia and uredinia thus become relatively unimportant, both in the grouping of genera and the description of species, even their presence or absence often being deemed systematically inconsequential' Subsequent enhancement of this practical view of pleomorphism with priority given to sexual characters can be traced in deliberations on proposed changes to the nomenclatural rules. The terms for morphological states and reproductive forms of fungi were explained by Hennebert &amp; Weresub (1977) prior to their incorporation into the revision of the rule for fungi with a pleomorphic life cycle, i.e., Article 59 of the Sydney Code (Voss &amp; al., 1983). These terms were part of the product of a vigorous, year-long international discourse, by a special subcommittee of the International Mycological Association, that formed the basis for the revision. The term "holomorph" was defined as referring to the whole organism. Two systems of naming taxa were distinguished. The botanical system is required to bear evidence of sexuality; the "characterizing form [of this</page><page sequence="3">FEBRUARY 1992 93 system] that is involved in producing meiotic diaspores... [is] termed the 'teleomorph'". The anatomical system is a contrasting non-botanical system; "the form basic to the anatomical scheme" is the 'anamorph', a term for "the asexual, mitotic, diasporic expression of a fungus.' Another historical tenet of mycological systematics is reflected in this terminology. The presumption has been that an invariable sequence of nuclear events involving the exchange of genetic information has invariable morphological expression. Meiotic species express sexual structures associated with the predictable sequence of chromosome pairing, recombination, and distribution found in meiosis, although meiosis has not necessarily been demonstrated to occur in all such structures and may or may not involve genomes derived from different partners. In opposition are mitotic species, which may reproduce by conidia or reproductive units derived from hyphal fragments or may lack any reproductive structures, and do not exhibit meiosis or sex- ual reproductive structures. Unlike genomes may recombine in mitotic species (Pontecorvo, 1956), but not by the predictable sequence of meiotic events. There are three hurdles to combining these two systems so that mitotic and meiotic fungi can be named and classified together: the (1) primacy given meiotic state characters, (2) presumed necessity for maintaining the deuteromycetes as a practical way to identify mitotic states, and (3) difficulty of reconciling this meiotic primacy with the concept that fungi can survive and evolve quite well without meiosis. The evolutionary capacity of mitotic fungi was addressed by Pontecorvo (1956). He demonstrated the existence of the parasexual cycle, which provides an ameiotic mechanism for recombination and rapid evolution promised by the enhanced spread of mutations. Recent molecular systematic studies support the hypothesis that meiotic and mitotic fungi evolve at comparable rates. Gaudet &amp; al. (1989) investigated ascomycetes with Fusarium anamorphs and mitotic Fusarium species. Their phylogenies combine both types of fungal species. They show that the mitotic species have as closest relatives meiotic species and that mitotic species have continued to evolve at rates similar to meiotic species. Taylor &amp; al. (1990) investigated ascomycetes with Penicillium mitotic states, some of which also have meiotic states in Talaromyces, expecting to find many separate rela- tionships between the Penicillium species and their closest meiotic relatives. Instead, they found that, with one exception, the mitotic Penicillium species formed a clade distinct from the species with Talaromyces meiotic states. For the mitotic Penicillium species, the authors hypothesized that, "most of their interspecific diversity has developed since their divergence.' These mitotic fungi are evolving without meiosis and their relationships to all fungi can be demonstrated using nucleic acid characters. Ironically, while mycologists are now able to study systematics, phylogenetics and population biology of fungi without regard to the presence or absence of a meiotic morph, these same fungi cannot be classified together. The species concept related to pleomorphic expression was vigorously debated in a conference published in The whole fungus by Kendrick (1979) and the comments are particularly germane to this article. L. K. Weresub &amp; L. K. Pirozynski (in Kendrick, 1979: 17-25) reviewed the history of maintaining separate classifications for the anamorphic (mitotic) and teleomorphic (meiotic) fungi and concluded: "The time has not yet come, therefore, when any fungus known only in its anamorphic phase ... should be treated as a species with the botanical system of nomenclature". They weakened their conclusion with a perceptive comment, "We trust that the time will come when our grasp of the morphology, biochemistry and genetics of all fungi will</page><page sequence="4">94 TAXON VOLUME 41 enable us to classify all anamorphic fungi botanically' "... the Code does impose certain limitations on what we can do ... the ultimate name of the holomorph must be that of the teleomorph. This prevents us from classifying the higher fungi on the basis of their [mitotic states], for which we might be able to make a perfectly good case. Luttrell (in Kendrick, 1979: 37) complained about the same subject: "The nomenclature of holomorphs which have teleomorphs submits to the taxonomic deci- sion that the teleomorph is the prime form of the species ... we must learn to make taxonomic decisions ... not ... allowing a nomenclatural rule to pre-empt our tax- onomic judgment. Is not nomenclature supposed to serve taxonomy?" Although in another statement, Luttrell seemed ambivalent (in Kendrick, 1979: 264). "The anamorph may be the fungus. I personally don't believe that, but many people do think that a large number of fungi exist only as [the mitotic state]:' Kendrick con- sidered that fungi may be purely mitotic as did Mtiller. Kendrick (1979: 39) said, "I believe that there exist ... fungi which, even in their entirety, do not encompass a teleomorph. I see no reason why some fungi, which began life as perfectly ordinary Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes should not, through the normal process of evolu- tion, have lost ... the ability to produce teleomorphs' Muiller (in Kendrick, 1979: 264) said, " ... there are actually three kinds of holomorph: (1) a teleomorph without any anamorph; (2) a teleomorph with one or more anamorphs; (3) an anamorph or anamorphs with no teleomorph' Similar sentiments have been expressed more recently by Dudka (1986), "Among the [deuteromycetes] the phenomenon of the full loss of the capability for teleomorph formation is widespread'" Mufller's view of a holomorph lacking a teleomorph leads us to two interpretations of what constitutes a pleomorphic fungus in Article 59: the common, broad, sensu lato view and the uncommon, narrow, sensu stricto view. These views are graphically presented in Fig. 1. By Article 59 sensu lato, the recognition of the species is reserved for those with meiotic morphs. Only the meiotic and pleomorphic species exhibit the sexual or "teleomorphic" state on which a holomorph can be recognized. No distinction is made between the meiotic and the pleomorphic holomorph. The mitotic state is included in a pleomorphic and subsequently a holomorphic species description as an "anamorph" in opposition to the "teleomorph". Names brought to a mitotic morph have no nomenclatural standing in taxa such as genera 1, 2, and 3 of Fig. 1, nor in their family. Provisional taxonomic categories composed of optionally recognized 'form species' (A, B, C, D) must be grouped into 'form genera' (A, B, C) which in turn make up their 'form family' (Fig. 1). By Article 59 sensu stricto, holomorphy would be recognized in all its fungal expres- sions. The rules of Article 59 designed to resolve issues of nomenclatural priority con- cerning names for fungi characterized by pleomorphic reproduction in a life cycle would be applied only to pleomorphic fungi and only at the species level. Taxa at the generic, family or higher taxonomic level of Fig. 1 could comprise species based on meiotic (1, 2, 3, 4), mitotic (A, B, C, D) or pleomorphic (2, 5) morphs. For example, genus 1 has all possible types of holomorphs; genus 2 has a meiotic holomorphic con- tent; genus 3 is based on mitotic (A, B) and pleomorphic (5) holomorphic species. Genus 4 is based solely on a mitotic species (D). The family comprising these taxa con- tains all types of holomorphs. There are no form taxa. The pleomorphy regulated by Article 59 concerns the Ascomycotina and Basidiomycotina with the exception of the lichen-forming taxa. By the sensu lato</page><page sequence="5">FEBRUARY 1992 95 interpretation, because pleomorphy exists in some of these species of fungi, it is anticipated to occur in all species, regardless of their specific life-cycle. Accordingly, pleomorphy is regulated in all species and the holomorph applies only to species with a meiotic morph. Article 59 sensu lato is the accepted interpretation. By the sensu stricto interpretation, rules concerning pleomorphy would apply only to pleomorphic species possessing both meiotic and mitotic morphs. Species with only a meiotic morph or with only mitotic morphs would not be covered by Article 59. All combina- tions of morphs would be holomorphs: meiotic, mitotic, and meiotic plus mitotic. Supraspecific taxa could harbor all three holomorphic types unlike the current prac- tice which combines the meiotic and pleomorphic holomorphs as one, and excludes the mitotic one. Article 59 sensu stricto is not in use. In light of the alternative interpretations of Article 59, we offer a solution to the problem of classifying meiotic and mitotic fungal species together: change the Code to clearly allow fungi to be described botanically (in the sense of Hennebert &amp; Article 59, Sensu lato Mitotic Species A Form Genus A Mitotic Species B Mitotic Species C Form Genus B -Form Family Mitotic Species D - Form Genus C Meiotic Species 1 Genus 1 Pleomorphic Species 2 Meiotic Species 3 - Genus 2 Family Meiotic Species 4 Pleomorphic Species 5- Genus 3 Article 59, Sensu stricto Meiotic Species 1 Pleomorphic Species 2 Genus 1 - Mitotic Species C Meiotic Species 3 Meiotic Species 4 Genus2 - Family Mitotic Species A Mitotic Species B Genus 3 - Pleomorphic Species 5 Mitotic Species D - Genus 4 - Fig. 1. Contrasting classification of nine species reflected by broad and narrow interpretations of the Code's Article 59 of Section 4, "The names of fungi with a pleomorphic life cycle".</page><page sequence="6">96 TAXON VOLUME 41 Weresub, 1977), irrespective of their ability to meiose. The term holomorph would then be synonymous with the term fungus and the terms teleomorph and anamorph would have standing in the code only at the species level and only for species with a demonstrated pleomorphic life cycle. This solution would bring a contemporary and impartial balance to the extreme weight historically given meiotic characters by the Linnaean "sexual system" that "reflected Linnaeus's evaluation of the preeminent importance of reproduction" and "indicated the secret working plan of the creator" (Mayr, 1982). Meiotic characters once and for all would be reduced to parity with other characters in classification as it has already been reduced in systematics and phylogenetics. There would be no deuteromycetes. Fungal species with meiotic states would be known by the name applied to the meiotic states. Fungal species without meiotic states would be known by the name applied to their mitotic states. Pleomor- phic species could be known by the whole fungus name. Fungi with several mitotic reproductive states would be known by the name carrying the most meaningful infor- mation. These changes would acknowledge the mitotic holomorph, a mitotically reproduc- ing fungal species with no recognized association to a morphologically expressed sex- ual state, and would broaden the botanical system of classification to include all fungal species, mitotic as well as meiotic. These changes would also reduce the present disruption in classification and naming caused by the supposed requisite discovery of meiotic states for mitotic fungi. Emended descriptions would accommodate addi- tional states, but the classification would remain unchanged. If the meiotic state had been named, priority would prevail. Predictions of relationships between mitotic and meiotic states of a single species, or among separate mitotic and meiotic species, could be deduced by morphological characters alone. Confirmation of relationships could come from careful morphological observation or from molecular evidence alone, or from a combination of both types of information. Accordingly, the type element of a fungal species could be a morphological specimen, a combination of a morphological and nucleic acid specimen, or only a nucleic acid specimen (Reynolds &amp; Taylor, 1991a). Although the benefits of classifying all fungi in one system are obvious to all mycologists who have needed to explain the dual system to students or colleagues, integrating the deuteromycetes into the higher fungi will present nomenclatural pro- blems. Whether Article 59 is revised or merely reinterpreted in current practice, name stability and priority will be important issues not only with species but also with higher taxa (Reynolds &amp; Taylor, 1991b). For example, the pending proposal to stabilize anamorphic "Names in Current Use" (Hawksworth, 1989, 1992; Hawksworth &amp; Greuter, 1989) may need to be reexamined in light of the altered application of anamorph implicit in Article 59 sensu stricto. We appreciate the fact that clarification of the biology in Article 59 and a proper nomenclatural provision for naming the whole fungus from a contemporary perspec- tive cannot be implemented without open and thorough debate. We intend that this morphological and molecular perspective on Article 59 will reopen within the mycological and botanical community a discussion that began almost a century ago without a practical and biological solution. The creation of two separate classifica- tions was a logical response to taxonomy based on two different and immiscible sets of morphological characters. Now that molecular characters found in all kinds of fungal morphs can be routinely studied, pressure to extend the botanical system to incor- porate all versions of the whole fungus can only increase with each new molecular systematic study.</page><page sequence="7">FEBRUARY 1992 97 Conclusions If meiotic morph characters are absent and mitotic morph characters are present, a fungus cannot automatically be considered to be an anamorphic state. Application of Article 59 is ambiguous, with a sensu lato interpretation, and a sensu stricto reinterpretation. Article 59 should be revised to clarify pleomorphy as applicable at only the species level, that is, only for those species that have demonstrable pleomorphy of meiotic and mitotic morphological characters in the same life cycle. This revision would specify Article 59 sensu stricto. A serious alternative to the previous conclusion would be to eliminate Article 59 and the recognition of special rules for pleomorphic fungi from the Code altogether. The successful taxonomy and nomenclature of exempted lichenized fungi demonstrate the validity of this suggestion. If the last two conclusions were accepted, a mitotic holomorph name could have priority over a name associated with a type exhibiting meiotic characters. Also, supraspecific taxa which comprise meiotic, mitotic, and pleomorphic holomorph- based species would need critical reexamination for the proper application of both taxonomic and nomenclatural name priority.
