<plain_text><page sequence="1">Clément d'Alexandrie: Les Stromates. Stromate VII. Edited by Alain Le Boulluec. Pp. 350. (Sources Chrétiennes, 428). Paris: Les Éditions du Cerf, 1997. ISBN 2 204 05828 9. Paper 197 F. The seventh book of the Stromateis is surely an impressive study of the life of prayer as 'conversation with God', including its framing in set prayers at the third, sixth and ninth hours, by dawn prayers, and by Wednesday and Friday fasting. Clement rejects comparison between his work and a well ordered garden, but in fact the book is rather well structured and shows some subtlety in its ordering. Platonic terms express Christian themes while Christian terms express Platonic themes of spirituality. Being modelled on Moses, Plato could get much right. Clement's stated objective is to vindicate the Church's faith from the criticisms of Jews and pagans, the latter religion anthropomorphic as educated Christians are not. Yet the overriding goal appears in the last twenty-two chapters, namely polemic against heretical sects claim ing that what they have on offer is Gnosis. Clement is out to recapture this term for 'the old and catholic Church'. The fissi parous and endlessly quarrelling sects are being cited by pagans as their ground for not believing in Christianity. With an edition of Stromateis V and an important study of second-century heresy behind him, M. Le Boulluec is the ideal commentator on Strom. VII. There is next to nothing not put under his microscope in the annotation. The text in the Florence manuscript needs attention even since Stàhlin's critical edition nearly a century ago has been revised by Friichtel and then by Frau Treu. As a matter of policy the new edition reinstates L's readings when possible; and this turns out to be in about 100 places. Translation and commentary are a pleasure to read. Beside an index of biblical and apocryphal references (and agrapha), the volume ends with an index of Greek words commented on in the notes. A note at page 93 does not concede that citations of Xenophanes are of Christian manufacture. Henry Chadwick</page></plain_text>
