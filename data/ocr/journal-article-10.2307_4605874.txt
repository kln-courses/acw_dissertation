BIOGEOGRAPHY, AN ECOLOGICAL PERSPECr- IVE, by Pierre Dansereau, The Ronald Press Co., New York, xiii+ 394 pages, 53 tables, 128 figures. $7.50. Dansereau's textbook on biogeography is an attempt to synthesize our present know- ledge on "the origin, distribution, adapta- tion, and association of plants and ani- mals." It is the product of years of fruit- ful investigation by the author in the fields of phytosociology, plant ecology, and plant geography. The book includes an introductory chapter and others label- led as follows: History of Biota, Biocli- matology, Synecology, Autecology and Man's Impact on the Landscape. Included also is an Appendix on the phytosociology of the Middle St. Lawrence Valley, and excellent glossary, an extensive biblio- graphv and both name and subject indices. The contribution is noteworthy in that the tables and excellent figures constitute over 40 percent of the total volume of the book. The title of the text may be a bit mis- leading since less than 20 percent of the text, or the bibliography, is concerned specifically with animals. It is doubtful, therefore, whether this book would be suitable as a textbook in biogeography courses, at least when taught by zoologists. On the other hand, the inclusion of some animal material should make it more in- teresting for students in phytogeography courses. In the matter of terminology, Dansereau states that since the language of ecology "may seem a little abstruse to many biolo- gists and non-biologists, and since tech- nical vocabulary is not deliberately avoid- ed in this book, a Glossary is included." The author is to be congratulated on bringing together in the form of tables the approximately equivalent terms as uti- lized by different investigators. However, Dansereau does use a great number of terms which will do little to dispel the idea that ecology seems to run more to words than to ideas. For example, on page 16, he utilizes several terms, in bold- face type (from another author) without defining them in the glossarv. On page 206 he states that words with teleological implications (e.g. calciphilous) are taboo to many scientists but that it seems inad- visable to replace them since they have long been in use. To the reviewer this attitude is unfortunate, especially since substitute words without anthropomorphic connotations are available (e,g. calcicol- ous vs silicolous on p. 210). The maps and figures are both excellent and numerous. The figures, in particular, are both ingenious and challenging, and might well serve as examples for future writers in bioecology and biogeography. Nevertheless, some ecologists feel that the portrayal of communities by symbols has been overdone (e.g. Pp. 148-152). Al- though the reviewer does not agree with this criticism, it does appear that a greater uniformity of symbolism throughout the bc.ok might have been achieved. Dansereau emphasises the classification of plant communities into higher categor- ies. "Thus the associations are lumped in- to alliances, these into orders, and the latter into classes . . . " A considerable num- ber of ecologists doubt the wisdom of the suffix -etum for plant associations since it suggests a degree of uniformity which does not exist. It is possible that the en- tire scheme of classification of plant com- munities is called into question on the basis of vegetation as a continuum. In Okla- homa we have confirmed the fact that the deciduous forests constitute one continuum and that the grasslands constitute another. If such clines exist in other large vegeta- tional units, it would appear undesirable to classify vegetation into higher categor- ies. It will be recalled that the title of the book emphasizes the ecological perspective</page><page sequence="2">188 Bios of biogeography. Although Cain's work on the Foundations of Plant Geography emphasizes the floristic approach, includ- ing speciation, Dansereau's book dwells primarily on an ecological or environmen- tal attack. The book is remarkable in the amount of material that is encompass- ed within its 394 pages. Aside from cer- tain controversial points which are pres- ent in any primarily theoretical study, this book constitutes a penetrating evaluation of the foundations of biogeography. This volume impresses me as a highly valuable acquisition to ecological literature and one that should be on the bookshelf of every field worker interested chiefly in the ec- ology and geography of plants and ani- mals.
