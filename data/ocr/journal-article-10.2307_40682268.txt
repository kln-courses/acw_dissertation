<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shelley and Shaw's Prose Barbara Peart1 Few Shaw scholars give any attention to his extensive use of Shelley's prose in his own prefaces and essays. Shelley is now gen- erally acknowledged in Shavian criticism as an inspiration to the young Shaw and as a strong influence on certain areas of his phi- losophy, especially vegetarianism. But Shelley, like a number of other writers, was also a source of specific ideas and textual ma- terial for Shaw's mature work. Shaw vigorously employed a large stock of matter from Shelley's essays on religion in several of his own prose pieces, including "On Miracles, a Retort," preface on "The Pros- pects of Christianity" to Androcles and the Lion, preface on "The In- fidel Half Century" to Back to Methuselah, "A Catechism on My Creed," and "On Ritual, Religion, and the Intolerableness of Toler- ance." Shaw's preface to Methuselah is the best single example of both his borrowings from Shelley's work and the reasons for their continued obscurity. One basic cause of neglect may be simple unfamiliarity with Shelley's prose writing on the part of Shaw1 critics. Despite rein- terpretations, Shelley's image remains poetic dreamer rather than, as Shaw insisted it should be, social reformer. His prose work is usually regarded as secondary in importance, and for that reason it may have been passed over by many interpreters of Shaw's sources. Shelleyan correspondences in Shaw's essays are not difficult to trace, once no- ticed, as Roland Duerksen has demonstrated by pointing out the broad relationship between the Androcles preface and Shelley's Essay on Christianity.2 An integral key to recognizing the Shelleyan debt in the Methuselah preface lies in Shaw's ability to utilize extremely suitable material. Besides making use of Shelley himself as a dramatic image in the preface and adopting the title "Almighty Fiend" for the Chris- tian God from Queen Mob, Shaw prosecuted Shelley's attack on irra- tional religion to the same purposes and much in the same form of A Refutation of Deism. It is a virtuoso borrowing, for Shaw genuinely assimilated Shelley's essay into his own statement of the problem, made freshly relevant by continuation. This is more than a matter of rephrasing or adding modern details. Shelley often echoed other writers in his essays, and portions of the preface are nearly quoted from A Refutation. Shaw's achievement as a borrower in this piece consists in having thoroughly understood Shelley's ideas and thus hav- ing been able to command them in superceding the duality of religion and reason through evolution. 1 Barbara Peart's article is a revised portion of a thesis submitted at Arizona State University. * Mieiiey ana Miaw, aneueyan laeas in Victorian Mterature, ö tu aies in n-ngnsn Literature, vol. 12 (The Hague: Mouton, 1966), p. 187. 39</page><page sequence="2">Shaw incorporated Shelley's essay both in design and in detail. Shaw's preface and the essay are built on the same three-stage pro- gression from sceptical free-thinking to rational experimentation with atheism and rejection of it, to final recognition of the human need for religion and an attempt to reconcile reason and science with institu- tional religion. Shelley dramatized this progression in a conversation between a Christian versed in rational arguments and a sceptical deist. Shaw1 presented the first two stages as the past positions of himself and society. He then offered the doctrine of Creative Evolution and his conclusions about the religious functions of art and myth as guide- lines for a contemporary solution of the thinker's problem. Not only did Shaw view religious thought according to the formula of A Refu- tation, but he adopted reasoning connected with each stage as well. Both writers contended that most people are passively orthodox and do not seriously consider religion often enough to be either atheist or believer: How small is the proportion of those I have pointed out elsewhere that the who really believe in God to the British nation does not consist of thousands who are prevented by their atheists and Plymouth Brothers; and occupations from ever bestowing a I am not now going to pretend that serious thought upon the subject, and it ever consisted of Darwinians and the millions who worship butterflies, Lamarckians.

In rejecting the traditional forms of religion both Shelley and Shaw were especially critical of church dogma: I am willing to promise that if, after ...

(p. lxxx) Shaw's "homeopathic" view of atheism was also Shelleyan; that is, like Shelley, he chose "atheist" as a distinction from existing churches. Both A Refutation and the preface reject true godlessness, although Shelley's rejection can be seen as ironic by considering him a literal atheist. Shaw apparently took that rejection seriously, as his own ob- jections to atheistic materialism are made on the same two points, the personal unreliability that results, and the unnatural fatalism of it as a philosophy: The atheist is a monster among men.

There was mind and purpose behind it. (p. xxxvii) 41</page><page sequence="4">A more specific example of Shaw's usage of both idea and form is his adaptation of Shelley's point-by-point refutation of deism into the preface from the section "In Quest of the First Cause" through "The Moment and the Man." A Refutation reviews and rejects Paley's watchmaker theory of universal design, the case for causation in the world, and the proof of God's existence by universal belief. The first two of these standard deist arguments are echoed in the preface, while the third, coupled with a cardinal Shelleyan image, appears in "On Ritual," written the next year. Consideration must also be given to possible influence on the preface by A Defence of Poetry on the basis of general similarity and an apparent borrowing in "A Catechism/' published in 1922. Shaw anticipated recent views by accepting the Refutation as Shelley's probing of an intellectual problem rather than as a declaration of atheism.4 The essay is unsatisfying because it of- fers no alternatives to the positions it makes unacceptable. Shaw, hav- ing himself passed through negative atheism and Darwinism to his affirmative position, perceived how Creative Evolution filled this void. Shaw linked Shelley's objections to deism directly to his former negative position and the success of Darwin's work by viewing Dar- winians as having progressed from disenchanted deists whose "more or less mystical intellectual speculations" had slumped after 1830 and left the field to agnostic physical scientists.5 It is worth noting that Shelley qualified as one of these deist-evolutionaries who tried to ex- plain the world by some means other than revealed religion. He was acquainted with the work of Erasmus Darwin and Buffon, and it is suggested in the arguments of his deist in A Refutation. Shelley's character believes "that neither blind chance nor undistinguishing necessity has brought them into being. The adaptation of certain ani- mals to certain climates, the relation borne to each other by animals and vegetables, and by different tribes of animals; the relation, lastly, between man and the circumstances of his external situation are so many demonstrations of Deity" (p. 130). This is quite acceptable to Shaw's doctrine of Creative Evolution, which in some ways is a scien- tific version of deism. In rejecting unscientific religion, Shaw telescoped his negative position and Shelley's first objection to design into two anecdotes, be- ginning with the familiar pocket-watch story which appears in most Shavian prose dealing with atheism. It pictures his younger self as a rational challenger of Jehovah, similar to his view of Shelley in many essays, including this preface. Secondly, "Father Addis "argues with this younger Shaw.

Addis offers to stop at number one to preserve his faith, but Shaw found this no solution. Shelley had contended that "it is easier to suppose that the Universe has existed from all eternity than to conceive an eternal being capable of creating it" (p. 131). Shaw remonstrated: "By your leave, said I, it is as easy for me to believe that the universe made itself as that a maker of the universe made himself: in fact much easier; for the uni verse visibly exists and makes itself as it goes along, whereas a maker for it is a hypothesis" (p. xxxvi). But Shaw began to hedge his attack, in a manner similar to Shelley's characters, by admitting that these well-intended arguments paved the road to mechanistic Darwinism. In these portions Shaw changed sides as effectively as Shelley did in his essay. Addis defends estab- lished religion while the younger and older Shaws respectively advo- cate negative atheism and rejuvenated religion. Shaw next dealt with Paley's theory by tracing his own route back to affirmation of the need for religious faith. Shelley had re- futed Paley by declaring that "design must be proved before a de- signer can be inferred." Design is assumed in a watch because we know about human capacity for such creations. We do not know this about a god, and "the laws of motion and the properties of matter suffice to account for every phenomenon, or combination of pheno- mena exhibited in the Universe" (pp. 130-33). The younger Shaw also refuted Paley by denying willed design, but he further saw that the point was not only how the universe was made, but why. Darwin's scientifically ordered universe "whilst admitting Paley's facts, could knock the brains out of Paley by the discovery of a method whereby watches could happen without watchmakers . . ." (p. xi). Dogmatical- ly followed, however, this destroyed conscious mind as well. Shaw was therefore left, like Shelley's characters, searching for a better solu- tion to the problem than either godless rationalism or mindless Dar- winism. Shelley's third Refutation argument against the deistic assump- tion that all men believe in a similar god was echoed by Shaw in On Ritual," which was written the year after the preface but was not published until 1967. Shelley twice catalogued disparate symbols of god, for instance: "The word God cannot mean at the same time an ape, a snake, a bone, a calabash, a trinity, and a unity" (p. 136). Shaw listed a reversed stage of anthropomorphic gods from "the visible cor- poral humanly-emotional figure depicted by Blake and Raphael, or fashioned with a hundred hands and an elephant's trunk by Hindoo artificers, or as a man with a hawk's head by the Egyptians, until you come to the mere block of stone on which the human imagination fastens as sacred in the stage in which it must have something con- 43</page><page sequence="6">crete to cling to save it from madness."6 One other suggestion of Shelleyan influence on the Methuselah preface is the similarity between parts of A Defence of Poetry and the concluding artist-prophet sections of Shaw's essay. They are parallel in a general sense, though their construction and specific purposes are not strikingly similar. Shaw may have been influenced somewhat by Schopenhauer's "Religion, a Dialogue," which bears resemblance to Shaw's emphasis on art as iconography. Some case for Shaw's having reread the Defence in this period, however, can be made from his statement in "A Catechism," the following year. In this interview, which repeats matter from the preface, Shaw was asked: "Do you believe that given enough data to go on we could account for every- thing?" His reply parallels Shelley's complaint in the Defence: We have more moral, political, and No. As a matter of fact we have data historical wisdom than we know how enough, from the Alps to the elec- to reduce into practice; we have more trons, to account for everything fifty scientific and economic knowledge times over; but we have not the than can be accommodated to the just brains to interpret them, distribution of the produce which it (SR p. 129) multiplies. (p. 293) Shaw was also capable of picking up a specific image from Shel- ley's prose. In "On Miracles," published in 1908, he pocketed Shelley's often-used illustration of the modern non-miracle. Shelley had bor- rowed the idea from The Age of Reason (as Cameron notes, p. 307) but the member of the humane society was his own addition. Shaw used both Paine's distinction between death and drowning and Shel- ley's figure: But even supposing that a man should None of us has ever seen a man raise a dead body to life before our raised from the dead except on the eyes, and on this fact rest his claim to banks of the Serpentine by a police- being considered the son of God; the man skilled in the art of inducing Humane Society restores drowned per- artifiicial respiration; and even this sons, and because it makes no mystery exception we try to get out of by the of the method it employs, its members manifestly futile contention that the are not mistaken for the sons of God. resurrected one was not dead - that (p. 106) he was only drowned. (SR p. 44) This idea does not appear in the Refutation, although it does occur in several Shelley essays, including the Queen Mab note to the line "I will beget a son." Again, in "On Ritual," Shelley's scale measuring the approach of any dogma to the test of the senses served Shaw in expressing his Quaker-Ritualist range. The case for tolerating a wide range of religi- ous sentiments builds in Shaw's work over a long period. It appears specifically in his religious speeches early in this century and con- tinues through The Apple Cart in 1929, but this particular image was not used with it except in "On Ritual."

(SRp. 161) Shaw made such a scale four times in this essay. On Ritual" is itself a considerable example of Shelleyan similarities and borrowings, par- ticularly regarding the nature of belief. Shelley's conviction that be- lief is involuntary and divorced from either guilt or virtue underlies Shaw's appeal for tolerance. This amount of parallelism and direct borrowing represents a more serious study than the one intense teenage reading of Shelley so often quoted from Shaw's reminiscences. From On Miracles" in 1908 through the Androcles and Methuselah prefaces to "On Ritual" in 1922 Shaw was rereading Shelley's prose writing on religion and using ideas and phrasing from them. I believe recognition of this will facilitate study of Shaw's sources on a number of points. Considera- tion of Shelley as a literary influence on Shaw illuminates their rela- tionship and the emphasis Shaw consistantly placed on it. Only two conclusions concerning them have been reached in Shaw scholarship: that Shelley influenced Shaw's ideas and that Shaw was quite critical of Shelley's poetry and the worship of it. Direct literary influences, especially from Shelley's prose, have been left unexplored. Yet this is the natural area for such influence to have occurred, since both writers were accomplished essayists, and particularly since Shaw's philosophy was partly shaped by his early reading of Shelley's works. Far from considering Shelley's prose to be junvenalia or the hysterical produc- tions of idealism, Shaw incorporated it in terms of purpose, structure, and phrasing. Significantly, scholars of Shelley's prose, such as Duerk- sen and Cameron, have appreciated Shaw's criticism of Shelley. Final- ly, assessment of Shelley's influence illustrates the fact that Shaw's borrowings need not indicate dependence on other writers. Shelley has been praised for his ability to assimilate the radical and scientific thought of his time into his work. Shaw also deserves credit for utiliz- ing material from a variety of sources through understanding of its modern relevance. 45</page></plain_text>
