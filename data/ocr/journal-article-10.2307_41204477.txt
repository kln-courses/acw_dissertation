<plain_text><page sequence="1">WhiteheacTs Philosophy of Adventure MASON W. GROSS task of evaluating the work of a philosopher is itself, obviously, a philosophical venture. Before we can estimate the value of such a work we must be ex- plicit about our standards of value, and in relation to philosophy this means that we must make clear our general conception of philosophy itself in order to determine what we may expect from a particular philosopher such as Whitehead. We may distinguish fairly clearly two very different con- ceptions of philosophy. According to the first, philosophers deal with a more or less fixed group of problems and submit various suggestions towards their solution. The group includes such problems as the relation between the mind and the body, freedom, causality, induction, perception or the status of the objects of perception and so on. Philosophers are classified according to their answers to these problems, and their answers are tested as to logical consistency or as to conformity with the "common sense" of the "plain man." Very seldom is any an- swer found satisfactory but this seems to cause no distress. Occasionally there is revolt within the ranks, but the rebels usually overstate their case and are promptly subdued. This discussion of particular philosophical problems has to be carried on within the framework of a more or less con- sciously accepted general philosophical system. The outline is fixed; the details still have to be supplied. In the case of the problems mentioned above, the framework is that of the Car- tesian philosophy. But Descartes himself, it is important to note, did not become a Cartesian until the last few years of his life. When he wrote his major philosophical works his concep- 361</page><page sequence="2">The American Scholar tion of philosophy was utterly at variance with the one just presented. He was not arguing within a framework; he was building a new one of his own. He had discovered a few simple ideas in terms of which everything could be explained. Possibly the explanation was not the true one; but had God been pre- sented with materials of certain specific kinds and had his crea- tive activity been limited to certain specific operations he could have created a world identical with the one in which we live. In this Descartes reminds one of Plato who, in the Timaeus, also undertook to give "a likely account" of the creation of the world out of specified materials. And although there are as many differences between Descartes or Plato and Whitehead as there are between Descartes and Plato, nevertheless Whitehead must be classed with them in respect to his general conception of philosophy. Speculative philosophy he defines as "the endeavor to frame a logical, coherent, necessary scheme of general ideas in terms of which every element of our experience can be inter- preted." Thus we must not expect him to provide Cartesian answers to Cartesian problems. A far more difficult and com- prehensive examination is required. From the definition itself we can derive at least three stand- ards by which we may evaluate philosophies of this second, speculative, sort. The first is that of logical consistency. This is, of course, a prime requisite but of less positive value than it might at first seem to be. Whitehead points out that no philos- ophy has ever been abandoned solely on grounds of incon- sistency. Even if a given system is, like Plato's, hopelessly incon- sistent it may still have a far greater value than any merely consistent philosophy, if it serves to illuminate certain hitherto unnoticed aspects of our experience. The other two standards, those of coherence and adequacy, are far better positive tests of the value of a philosophy. Whitehead is concerned to show that the traditional philosophical picture of the world of ex- perience is both incoherent and inadequate. It is inadequate in that there are obvious elements in our experience which cannot be fitted into the picture and which have to be flatly and boldly 362</page><page sequence="3">WhiteheacTs Philosophy of Adventure denied. It is incoherent in respect to the "arbitrary disconnec- tion of first principles." It is incoherent in the sense in which some people find modern music incoherent or unintelligible, namely in that there seems to be no intrinsic reason why a given instrument should join in at one point rather than another or why it should be just that instrument and not some other. Rationalism essentially aims at discovering logical coherence. It must be noticed that adequacy is an ideal towards which philosophers and scientists strive rather than a goal which any philosophy can claim to have attained. We can apparently never be sure that we have provided a scheme of ideas which will enable us to interpret every element of our experience, if only because every great philosophy brings into prominence new elements hitherto unnoticed. But we can and, as philosophers, we must endeavor to secure a greater measure of adequacy and coherence than has previously been exhibited. Whitehead repeatedly compares his philosophy with the general conception of the world underlying the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle and with the cosmology adopted by Des- cartes, Newton and Hume. Since the latter still dominates much philosophical, scientific and even popular thinking we must test it briefly by reference to our standards of coherence and ade- quacy. In this way we shall be able to understand more fully the task which Whitehead has set himself and we shall see more clearly the value of his contributions to philosophy. Incoherence is easily demonstrated in the case of Descartes. Since a substance is that which can exist by itself without the help of anything else, it follows that minds or mental substances do not require corporeal substance and vice versa. They can exist separately and independently. The fact that the world contains both kinds of substance is, from the point of view of either kind, a purely irrational coincidence. Materialists who denied the existence of mental substance, and idealists who denied material substance, can both be shown to have stemmed from Descartes. This radical dualism has provided subsequent philosophy with many of its most characteristic problems. 363</page><page sequence="4">The American Scholar But Descartes' system is incoherent in another equally serious way - in his account of change or process. Time is represented as a unique series of instants, and at each instant the world is complete. There is no reason at all, so far as the world is con- cerned, why there should be any change. A completely static universe is avoided only by the intervention of God, who recre- ates the world at each instant and reshuffles its component parts. Hume inherited this Cartesian incoherence and, in drawing s√≤me of its more startling consequences, exhibited its glaring inadequacy. Coupling the notion of time as a succession of dis- crete instants with the Cartesian emphasis on clear and distinct ideas, he adopted a theory of atomic impressions and ideas, sensations and mental images, each of which satisfied the Car- tesian definition of substance as that which required nothing but itself in order to exist. From this theory he was forced to draw sceptical conclusions concerning causality, induction and personal identity. If by causality we imply any power which extends from the world at one instant to the world at the next, then causality has already been ruled out by Descartes' account of time and re-creation, and Hume's psychology only serves to make the point more clear. Similarly if by induction we wish to infer from the present instant to the world at some totally distinct instant in the future, we clearly have no ground except custom for so doing. And if by personal identity we mean some- thing which endures continuously throughout a succession of instants we can know a priori that it doesn't exist. Other elements in Hume's philosophy are less clear. At one point it is said that memory can be identified as consisting of those images which are less vivid than sense-impressions; but Hume apparently abandoned this position without providing a substitute. He also neglected to explain how we observe the succession of impressions if at each instant our minds are con- stituted entirely by impressions and ideas, the latter being derived from impressions in some unexplained way. In other words no reason at all was given for thinking in terms of past, present and future. 364</page><page sequence="5">Whitehead's Philosophy of Adventure The conclusion for Hume is that the greater part of human behavior and human thought is irrational, based only on habit and feeling. The conclusion for us is that Hume's initial pre- suppositions, derived ultimately from Descartes, were inade- quate to the interpretation of our experience. For to call experiences, thoughts and behavior irrational is simply to say that they cannot be accounted for in any system of ideas with which one happens to be acquainted. Scepticism of this sort is merely the confession of personal and momentary defeat. Above all, a philosophy which is based on selected elements of our experience cannot be used to refute or disparage other elements in that same experience. The necessary inference from Hume's failure is that we must refuse to admit with Descartes the superior philosophical importance of clear and distinct ideas or images and that, in the hope of discovering a more adequate and coherent account of our experience, we must pay closer attention to certain insistent beliefs, possibly vaguely formed in the back of our minds but implicit in our daily practice. We shall not be concerned here with the various attempts to patch up the Cartesian philosophy which have kept philos- ophers busy since the time of Hume. But two consequences of Descartes' failure are important for us. One is the rise to promi- nence of epistemology or the theory of knowledge, which is primarily concerned with the problem "what can we know?" and not with the question "what do we know? " The epistemol- ogist adopts an attitude of detachment from his total experience at any moment and asks "what can I experience?" He closes his eyes and ponders "what can I see when I open my eyes?" This form of philosophy consists in legislating to experience in terms of a more or less definitely fixed group of philosophical concepts. A similar detachment characterizes the second important consequence of Descartes' position, the dogma of determinism. The present instant is considered as one instant in a temporal series, past, present and future ; and just as the world at each instant in the past can, theoretically, be completely accounted 365</page><page sequence="6">The American Scholar for by examining the world at the instant just previous to it, so the contemporary world can be explained in terms of the world an instant ago, and so on into the future. The whole pattern of the future is laid out, waiting for us to catch up with it. This is the so-called mechanistic or cinematographical conception of change. Each instant, with all its contents, is viewed as one square on a moving-picture reel. The whole reel has been de- veloped and merely awaits an operator to turn the crank. This view merely strengthens Hume's conception of mental activity as irrational and illusory. If we held to it consistently we should admit that all our hopes, fears, desires, plans, pur- poses, ideals are mere instantaneous psychological states and that we are actually not responsible for what may happen in the future. Moral idealism and plans for social reform are alike sterile. But we are not consistent. The whole of our re- ligious, moral and social structure is built upon the notion of men as self-determining, responsible organisms. In everyday life we simply ignore the deterministic conception just as we neglect epistemological considerations; but in philosophy we detach ourselves from ordinary life and become determinists or epistemologists again and legislate to experience, telling our- selves what experiences we can or ought to have. It is this detachment, this legislation, this distortion of ex- perience that Whitehead objects to most vehemently. The busi- ness of philosophy is not to pronounce experience irrational but to discover its rationality. If one set of concepts won't do, an- other set must be found. "The elucidation of immediate ex- perience is the sole justification for any thought; and the starting-point for thought is the analytic observation of com- ponents of this experience." The Cartesians detached certain elements from experience, systematized them and used them to legislate to the best of experience. We must abandon both the system and the detachment and start afresh in the present mo- ment, in our experience here and now, in order to discover all the characteristics of that experience. "A penny for your thoughts!" Except in exceedingly rare 366</page><page sequence="7">Whitehead's Philosophy of Adventure cases the reply almost never confines itself to the contempla- tion of the world at that single instant. Memories, plans, desires, hopes or regrets constantly occupy the greater part of our thoughts. "How can we use what we have to procure what we want?" A sense of derivation from and continuity with the immediate past and the immediate environment, a sense of the incompleteness of the present and of the imminence of the future, a feeling that things are going to happen and that we should try to control them - all these feelings are as much a part of our experience as this red patch or that cubical object. Spinoza recognized this when he insisted that the endeavor towards self-preservation was the basic element in man's emo- tional life. Plato emphasized the same factor in his doctrine of the soul as the source of motion and of love as its invariable characteristic, love of beauty and the desire for immortality. Aristotle insisted that the essence of man involved his continual struggle to fulfill his destiny. The one thing we almost never experience is the feeling that we have been pushed this far by the forces of nature and that we are contemplating the contemporary scene idly while wait- ing to be pushed on again. If we ever have this feeling we recognize it by contrast to our normal experience. Normally we are aware that our mind is considering various possibilities for the immediate future and that our bodies are storing up the energy, derived from the environment or accumulated from the past, which will enable us to follow out the mind's decisions. We know that the possibilities are numbered and that our energy and emotional drive is limited. We must adapt ourselves to the situation and size up the material. We must determine carefully what we want, focus our attention, select our mate- rials and organize our forces. We are individual sources of activity, constructing or helping to construct the future out of materials provided by the past. We feel the limits of our free- dom and seek to increase our power. These few sentences may serve to suggest briefly the content 367</page><page sequence="8">The American Scholar of our experience during any and every moment of the day and to contrast it with the strained attitude assumed by Hume. We may discover three main elements in each such moment. First there is the feeling of purpose or aim, of desires, of things to be done. Then there is the feeling of the energy and the emo- tional drive which will enable us to get these things done - the energy carried over from the immediate past, or the emo- tional reaction stimulated by our immediate environment in the form of anger or encouragement, fear or invigoration. And there is the feeling that we are reviewing our data, sizing up the situation, analyzing the factors present and adapting our purposes to our materials. All three factors are present in every situation. Sometimes one and sometimes another is dominant. When we daydream we permit ourselves to be carried along with a minimum of conscious purpose or analysis. We are merely aware vaguely of the ground supporting us and the warm air soothing us. Again, we may be so wrought up with our desires, or so hectic about accomplishing some end, that we ignore the environment and the forces driving us on and neglect to analyze sufficiently our present materials. Finally, we may become so wrapped up in the contemplative analysis or esthetic absorption of our data that we ignore ourselves and forget the original function of analysis. And although this attitude of detachment may be essential to science it is obviously erroneous to select it as the most characteristic state of man as a concrete individual. These three factors Whitehead seizes upon as providing the essential characteristics not merely of any occasion of human experience but of any occasion in the history of any and every real thing in the world. Concentrating our attention upon the happenings of the present moment, we can discover the derivation of energy from the past, not merely as energy in general but as just that quota of energy with its analyzable form, and we discover the pressing urge towards the creation of the next moment. We discover no succession of discrete instants but rather experience shading off indefinitely into the past from which the energy is 368</page><page sequence="9">Whitehead's Philosophy of Adventure derived and merging indefinitely into the future towards which that energy is directed. Since this account of an occasion of experience has been prefaced by a long appeal to abandon Humian notions as to the correct method of analysis, it is possible that it may be acceptable as an account of human experience. But the objec- tion is always raised that in generalizing this account to include atoms and cells, we are committing the fallacy of reading peculiarities of human experience back into nature. There are two ways of answering this objection. The first is that we are indulging in an adventure in speculation, and the sole criterion of our success in this respect is the applicability of these con- cepts to all entities. If physical and biological entities can be so interpreted, then our system is applicable. If the system enables us to include all the known characteristics of these entities, then it is adequate with respect to them. The second answer is that we are aiming at a coherent and unified account of all nature. The fallacy of anthropomorphism in science is surely no worse than the fallacy of de-anthropomorphizing man. Physics and biology formulate laws which apply to man but are inadequate to interpret all his experience. If we wish to give a more ade- quate account we must utilize all the information we can obtain from the sciences. In pursuit of the ideals of coherence and adequacy, the human organism with all its enormous complex- ities must be shown to be a natural organism capable of exem- plifying natural laws. In rephrasing the accounts given by the special scientists, none of their truth, applicability or adequacy is lost. Anthropomorphism is a methodological fallacy, and we need not be assumed to be giving methodological advice to the special scientists. Whitehead's cosmology, as worked out in Process and Reality , is a detailed attempt to describe the world in terms of the three factors we have discovered to be commonplaces of human ex- perience - the absorption of energy from the immediate past, the awareness of the data now present to us and the creative intent upon the immediate future. It would require the careful 369</page><page sequence="10">The American Scholar study of a physicist as competent as Whitehead himself to judge whether such a cosmological description is applicable and adequate at the level of simple physical entities, and the same examination should be performed at each level of increasing complexity. A mere philosopher can do more than judge Whitehead's system to be consistent, coherent and at least plaus- ible on these levels. If it is more than merely plausible, its magnificent applicability to human experience will be strongly confirmed. The criterion of adequacy is here coupled with the notion of applicability. This notion is central to Whitehead's conception of the function of philosophical and scientific ideas. Frequently an objection is raised to philosophy on the ground that its state- ments are unverifiable, that is to say that they are not applicable to our experience in any meaningful way. For Whitehead ap- plicability to immediate experience is the sole justification for any philosophical statement, but it should be noticed that unlike scientists his emphasis is not on verification. "It is more impor- tant that a proposition be interesting than that it be true," he declares, adding that, of course, true propositions are more likely to be interesting than false ones. The point is that here and now, in every occasion of experience, we seek information for some purpose. Ideas ana concepts, theories and propositions, all enable us to clarify and carry out our purposes more intelli- gently. Precisely that is their original and their ultimate justification. The more adequate our system of ideas, the more often we can use it to our advantage; the more coherent and unified it is, the more confidence we feel in it. Conversely if our system is inadequate, then in any particular occasion of ex- perience our actions are based on ignorance, prejudice, super- stition or emotional blindness. And if it is not coherent we may be pulled in two or more directions at once. We are unable to size up the situation rationally and we lose confidence in our individual abilities. Our capacity for purposive action is weak- ened by doubts and hesitations. These final considerations suggest the suitability of the title 370</page><page sequence="11">Whitehead's Philosophy of Adventure of this paper, "Whitehead's Philosophy of Adventure." The emphasis for Whitehead is always on the actual occasion of experience. Knowledge is relevant in the form of the applicabil- ity of concepts to the analysis of the component parts of that experience; and in that occasion is discovered the need for adequate and coherent concepts. These are required to guide and control those forces of energy and emotion which are the defining characteristics of the actual entity undergoing the experience. The very essence of any actual entity is its creative power, derived from the immediate past and striving to create the immediate future. The function of mentality is to analyze the component parts of that power and to consider possibilities of organizing them as the material for future development; and the history of the development of civilization is the story of the way in which ideas have gradually become determining factors in the interplay of physical forces - the story of the adventures of ideas. Thus Whitehead presents a picture of an individual utilizing all his material, physical and mental, to satisfy his desires and to realize his ideals, in contrast to the deterministic picture of futile, psychopathic robots being pushed willy-nilly along a path which has been laid out since the beginning of time. As against scepticism about causality he presents a doctrine of enti- ties whose very essence it is to construct the future. As against moral resignation and defeatism he pictures man continually and effectively striving towards the attainment of ideals. It is the business of philosophy to discover the rationality of ex- perience in order to give man confidence in his creative power. It is the business of science to analyze for man the materials and the forces which he can employ in the pursuit of his ideal aims. But mere knowledge can only indicate the possibilities of devel- opment. In the attainment of his ideals man requires confidence in his own creative ability, his physical strength and his mental vision. He requires the spirit of adventure. 371</page></plain_text>
