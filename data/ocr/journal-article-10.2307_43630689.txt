<plain_text><page sequence="1">Guõrún Nordal, Tools of Literacy : The Role of Skaldic Verse in Icelandic Textual Culture of the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2001). X + 440 pp. ISBN 0-8020-4789-0. £ 60.00 . With a major international project under way to re-edit the entire corpus ascribed to skalds from the ninth to fourteenth centuries, skaldic verse is enjoying an unprecedented surge of scholarly interest. In Tools of Literacy , Guõrún Nordal, a research fellow at the Árni Magnússon Institute in Reykjavik, and a general editor of the skaldic project, offers the first dedicated account of skaldic poetics in the late twelfth and thirteenth centuries. NordaPs contention is that during the twelfth century skaldic verse became a crucial tool in forging an enduring link between the prevailing illiterate culture and the imported elements of Latin learning (p. 339). In facilitating the transference of the theoretical discourse on language from the learned Latin context to indigenous traditions, skaldic verse-making came into direct contact with contemporary scholastic thought. Situated at this interface, Nordal claims, the thirteenth- century poets registered the prevailing learned ideas and concerns of the time in their highly traditional verse- form. Nordal makes an interesting case in part 1 for the dependence of thirteenth- century Icelandic poetology upon the introduction of skaldic verse into the study of grammatica in the twelfth century. However, the necessity of reading medieval skaldic theory as the product of a discrete scholarly environment that owes little to traditional sources of poetic knowledge is arguably less clear than Nordal assumes (e.g. p. 37). The subsequent account of the practical applications of poetry contains a good deal of useful material. Nordal examines the textual usage of the poetry, demonstrating the infiltration of the form at all levels of literary culture, before turning to consider the position of the poetic profession itself. In her strongest chapter, she identifies skaldic verse-making as a symbol of class for the new aristocracy in twelfth- and thirteenth-century Iceland. A detailed excursus offers profiles of fifty-four late twelfth- and thirteenth-century poets named in near-contemporary sources such as Sturlunga saga .</page><page sequence="2">1 76 Medium JEvjjm lxxii.i In part hi, Nordal explores the influence of learned writings on the skalds, comparing the theoretical presentation of anthropomorphic diction in Snorra Edda and the Third Grammatical Treatise with skaldic practice. Listing examples from her electronic database of thirteenth-century poetic diction, Nordal notes the lack of poetic simplexes for the body. For this reviewer, her pivotal account of the 'dismemberment' of the body in the kenning system is unpersuasive, however. Arguing that the fragmentation of the body in these kennings suggests 'the sensitivity of thirteenth-century aristocratic culture to the ambiguous image of the human body' (p. 345), Nordal fails to observe that the employment of the partial to signify the whole is an essential characteristic of the kenning system, the operation of which is largely dependent upon synecdoche. In part iv Nordal extends her account of the skalds' debt to contemporary thought with further discussion of the body- kennings, asserting that Neo- platonist cosmological ideas 'manifest themselves most forcefully in the art of the skaldic poet' (p. 345). Placing excessive weight on debatable evidence, she proposes that thirteenth-century body-kennings depict the human body as microcosmos , evoking the universe as macrocosmos in the head-kenning 'sky of the brain' ( beila himinrì) (p. 286). Nordal makes a much better case in her analysis of the changing conventions of gold-kennings, which illuminate the possible twelfth-century Danish roots of Snorra Edda. Nonetheless, one suspects that many readers will be frustrated at not having access to Nordal's database alongside the findings she derives from it. Minor textual infelicities are occasionally obtrusive. The omission of Ljótr Sumarliõason from table 4.6 (p. 157), for instance, leads Nordal to miscount the poets in her series of profiles (p. 343). The inclusion of 'nuts' at the end of a register of body-parts represented in the kennings listed in Litla Skalda (p. 227) is not stricdy wrong, of course, but produces an effect not necessarily intended by the author; the addition of the explanatory note '[as in hearts]' clarifies that these 'nuts' are metaphorical rather than euphemistic, but leaves us wondering whether the editors lacked discretion, or wit. The main, serious, problem with this book is unfortunately the failure of competent stylistic editing. Pleonasms, malapropisms, and distraught syntax beset the text. One needs more than a head for figures to sort one's way through the following conundrum: 'Of the sixty-eight poets mentioned in the sources, only thirty-eight are cited and an additional five are more than a name. Thirty-two of them belong to, or are associated with, the privileged section of society ... but at least six come from an undetermined social background or their verse was not honoured by a citation in the learned literature ... The remaining twenty-five are only a name ...' (p. 118). One cannot help feeling that in improving the prose, a ruthless editor could have produced a slimmer, sharper volume from 440 pages of this. In spite of these reservations, Tools of Literacy is a provocative account of a largely untouched area in skaldic studies. The quantity of material contained in its numerous tables, lists, and genealogies will alone make Nordal's book a useful reference tool.</page></plain_text>
