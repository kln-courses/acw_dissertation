<plain_text><page sequence="1">River vs. Town: Mark Twain's Old Tinmes on The Mississippi PAUL SCHMIDT T WAIN'S Old Times on the Mississippi opens on the pano- rama of a dull midwestern town hanging like a leech on a bend of the river: After all these years I can picture that old time to myself now, just as it was then: the white town drowsing in the sunshine of a summer's morn- ing; the streets empty, or pretty nearly so; one or two clerks sitting in front of the Water street stores, with their splint-bottomed chairs tilted back against the walls, chins on breasts, hats slouched over their faces, asleep-with shingle-shavings enough around to show what broke them down; a sow and a litter of pigs loafing along the sidewalk, doing a good business in watermelon rinds and seeds; two or three lonely little freight piles scattered about the "levee"; a pile of "skids" on the slope of the stone-paved wharf, and the fragrant town drunkard asleep in the shadow of them; two or three wood flats at the head of the wharf, but nobody to listen to the peaceful lapping of the wavelets against them ... Thus the town-white, dead, and presided over by the uncon- scious man, the drunkard. "White" has for Clemens, here as in Huckleberry Finn's description of Pap's "fishbelly white" face, the same impact of the empty, blank, and alien that it had for Melville's deliberations on the white whale. Beyond and against the town lies the river: Paul Schmidt is a lecturer in the department of Humanities at the California Col- lege of Arts and Crafts. [95]</page><page sequence="2">96 Nineteenth-Century Fiction the great Mississippi [the sentence continues], the majestic, the magni- ficent Mississippi, rolling its mile-wide tide along, shining in the sun: the dense forest away on the other side; the "point" above the town, and the "point" below, bounding the river-glimpse and turning it into a sort of sea, and withal a very still and brilliant and lonely one.1 Upon the lonely brilliance of these muddy waters comes the steam- boat, and the town's torpid sleep is shattered. The dozing clerks and the drunk awake; "all in a twinkling the dead town is alive and moving," converging on the wharf to see the incoming boat. And the boat is rather a handsome sight, too. She is long and sharp and trim and pretty; she has tall, fancy-topped chimneys, with a gilded device of some kind swung between them; the paddle-boxes are gorgeous with a picture or with gilded rays above the boat's name; the boiler deck, the hurricane deck, and the texas deck are fenced and ornamented witl clean white railings; there is a flag gallantly flying from the jack-staff; the furnace doors are open and the fires glaring bravely; the upper decks are black with passengers; the captain stands by the big bell, calm, imposing, the envy of all; great volumes of the blackest smoke are rolling and tumbling out of the chimneys-a husbanded grandeur created with a bit of pitch pine just before arriving at a town.... The steamboat docked, there is ten minutes of fine hullabaloo and bustle, and then she is under way again. "After ten more minutes the town is dead again, and the town drunkard asleep by the skids once more." Nineteenth- and twentieth-century literature speaks eloquenltly and often of a tragic split in life and mind. The bleached lifeless- ness of the town and the dark dramatic color of the river and the boat spell out Clemens's version of this conflict. At the heart of his best work lies a rich registration of this tension and his solid conviction that in the steamboat and what it represents lies its creative resolution. I. THE TOWN AND THE BOAT Old Times appeared as a series of articles in the Atlantic in 1875 and in the following year was pirated as a book. When Clemens returned to it in the early 1880's to pad it out to the requisite length for subscription book publication, he added several chapters, among which was one contrasting the steamboat 1 Life on the Mississippi (New York, n.d.) , pp. 43-44.</page><page sequence="3">Of Man and the River 97 with "the best dwelling" in the town.2 "The House Beautiful," as he presciently calls it, is a cluttered museum of articles for display. The books are piled on the parlor table with a "cast- iron exactness" which leads one to suspect that they are never read, a suspicion reinforced by the titles-Tupper's rhymed max- ims, Hannah More's novelized sermons published by the Re- ligious Tract Society, Ossian, and Scott. The fruit exhibited is not to eat; it is painted chalk. The guitar is mechanical. Wash- ington Crosses the Delaware in embroidery, "thunder-and-light- ning crewels"-"a work of art which would have made Washington hesitate could he have seen what advantage was going to be taken of it." The wayward grace of human use has been banished from this room, and the occupants pay the price. An oil painting of the family skins thems to a "fresh, raw, and red" look. The human figures in the daguerreotypes are blurred into mere dum- mies, racks on which to hang jewelry whose quality is "secured from doubt by stripes and splashes of vivid gold bronze." Lambrequins, bric-a-brac, sagging beds, mottoes done in yarn and faded grasses-the incongruous list, a standing device of American humor, functions here as playful insistence on the overwhelming profusion of things, of articles crammed together as for a drugstore show window. Clemens's point is manifest. This cataract of decor is designed to demonstrate status, the con- spicuous and joyless display of a superiority for which he has no respect. Life here has petered out into the static, the once-re- moved, and the representational. The dog is a toy who "squeaks when pressed upon," the rabbit is sugar candy, the very insects are a "convention of dessicated bugs and butterflies pinned to a card." The Jeffersonian assumption had been that the inde- pendent rural holding, particularly in that great hope, the West, would circumvent the insidious scramble after wealth and posi- tion. In Clemens's view that hope has vanished. The little town of Hannibal where he grew up was, he says in his Autobiography, "full of liberty, equality and the Fourth of July, and sincerely so," yet there were "grades of society" there too, and "the class lines were quite clearly drawn."' The displays of the House Beautiful 2 Ibid., p. 294. Old Times was incorporated in Life on the Mississippi as chaps. iv-xvi. 3 Mark Twain's Autobiography, ed. Albert B. Paine, New York (c. 1924), I, 120.</page><page sequence="4">98 Nineteenth-Century Fiction are the anxious application of Benjamin Franklin's advice to save, save, waste not, want not, in the face of a ravaging dog-eat- dog competition. Objects have lost all use and been reduced to mere commodities-of which one can never have' enough. The flowers are kept under a French clock dome and are done in "corpsy white wax." White is the color of the town and of death. One might be inclined to sense the animus of this inventory as a kind of modern functionalism and to suppose that Clemens's implied criticism anticipates the bare, ascetic, imitation-machine lines of Eames furniture and Frank Lloyd Wright architecture. But in the contrast which he draws in this chapter between the House Beautiful and the steamboat, fussy display is just as flagrant on the latter, and he now finds it admirable. The metal plumes which crown the stack, the wooden filigree work of its housings, the gilt deer horns over the big bell, the oil paintings on the state- room doors-these are hardly specified with a taste for streamlined simplicity. Even the barkeeper is elegant-"barbered and uphol- stered at incredible cost." The boat's splendor reaches its climax, significantly, in the pilot house: a sumptuous glass temple; room enough to have a dance in; showy red and gold window-curtains; an imposing sofa; leather cushions and a back to the high bench where visiting pilots sit, to spin yarns and "look at the river"; bright fanciful "cuspadores," instead of a broad wooden box filled with sawdust; nice new oil-cloth on the floor; a hospitable big stove for winter; a wheel as high as my head, costly with inlaid work; a wire tiller-rope; bright brass knobs for the bells; and a tidy, white- aproned, black "texas-tender," to bring up tarts and ices and coffee dur- ing mid-watch, day and night.4 "Showy," "imposing," and "nice" are used in this description almost literally. Whatever irony they have is not of the traditional sort where vain pretension comprises the trappings of inner empti- ness; rather it is that the glass temple is valued less for itself than as the proper setting for the great skill of the pilot. With this slight qualification it is fair to say that the narrator revels in outer dis- tinctions; he has a taste for extroverted grandeur which, though characteristic of a good deal of American folk poetry, is decidedly foreign to the main tradition of our letters. The sparkle of dia- monds and the sheen of silk have been, from Hawthorne to Hem- 4 Life on the Mississippi, pp. 60-61.</page><page sequence="5">Of Man and the River 99 ingway, suspect, useful only as the symbols of inner treasures; and even as symbols such riches have been felt to be second-best to uncontaminated nature-like the wild rosebush growing at the portal of the prison from which Hester emerges in The Scarlet Letter, or the trout streams of Spain where the hero of The Sun Also Rises recovers from the sickness which is Paris. "Diligence in worldly businesses, and yet deadness to the world" was the counsel of Puritan John Cotton, and it has been followed by the main line of American writers with Calvinist rigor. Contrary to the accepted view, there is little of this kind of simplicity and idealization of nature in Clemens's best work. His admiration for what Huckleberry calls the "gaudy" is not only at variance with conventional Protestant modes of appreciation, it is profoundly characteristic of his point of view, and deliberately so. He was aware, for example, that English writers taking the western tour, and particularly Dickens, had scorned the magnifi- cent river steamers as tawdry.' He counters Dickens's animadver- sion with intentionally transparent quibbles: Dickens's contempt results from standards too absolute, from comparing the steamboat with the Taj Mahal and the Matterhorn. Clemens's "vulgar" taste cannot, then, be laid to naivete, nor can it be discounted as part of the narrator's pose as a boy. The ultimate point of his burlesque pose of boyish awe is admiration and sympathy for the steamboat's dash and color. True, his comments on the crowd's enthusiasm for the boat are detached and indulgent: "The peo- ple," he says, "fasten their eyes upon the coming boat as upon a wonder." But he finally comes out in flat agreement with the crowd: "And the boat is rather a handsome sight, too." What is at issue between Clemens and Dickens transcends the aesthetic. Clemens sees the boat, not as a passenger and a critic 5 Indeed in the 1883 additions to the book he quotes extensively, often approvingly, from English critics of the American scene. Two manuscript chapters which were dropped before the first edition of Life on the Mississippi are devoted to these critics and to exonerating Mrs. Trollope of the charge of wrongheadedness in her strictures against American life and manners. The chapters were intended to follow the present chaps. xxix and xl, and are reprinted in Willis Wager's edition of the text (New York: Heritage Press, 1944). What Clemens calls the "irruption of foreign tourists" after the war with England includes, in his listing, William Cobbett, Harriet Martineau, de Tocqueville, Captain Marryat, Mrs. Trollope, and Charles Dickens. He concludes, mildly, that foreign visitors judge on the basis of different customs. The disparage- ments of the river boat to which Clemens is referring in chap. xxxviii are apparently those in Dickens's American Notes (The Works of Charles Dickens) (New York: Peter Fenelon Collier and Son, n.d.), XXVII, 184-189.</page><page sequence="6">100 Nineteenth-Century Fiction of the American scene, like Dickens, but as a member of the boat's crew. His endorsement of spectacular display in the steamboat and his rejection of what looks to be much the same thing in the Victorian parlor is justified by this allegiance. The embroidered sentimentalities and crocheted patriotism of the town cover an empty sham. The metal plumes and glass temple of the boat are the swagger and poetry proper to the great potency of the river- men. From the apprentice striker who proudly scrubs his rusty bolt at the rail before the envious town boys, and the mate whose careless profanity lightens and thunders, up through the craft and courage of the pilot, this is a brotherhood which has secured his fullest fidelity; and despite the tutelage of Mrs. Fairbanks, his wife, and William Dean Howells in what they were sure were the finer things of life, it was long before he abandoned this at- tachment. II. REALITY Old Times develops the conflict of town and boat in a series of burlesque encounters between a town boy and various mem- bers of the boat's crew, particularly the master pilot Bixby, who undertakes to teach the boy his craft.6 It is thus the story of a cub pilot's education, a story which ends with his redemption when he realizes his ambition to become "a part of the boat's family," a fellow worker among the rivermen. L'education sentimentale, a spiritual coming to terms with the world, has preoccupied writers from Rousseau to Thomas Mann. The distinction of Clemens's handling of this theme is the clear-cut reliability of the profession into which the apprentice is initiated and the consequent author- ity of his teacher, Bixby. The upshot of the cub pilot's novitiate -that he embraces the demands of river life and piloting and successfully carries them out-makes a radical contrast with the usual denouement in which the worldly occupation is demon- strated to be at best unworthy, at worst corrupting and compro- mising. The sensitive young man of modern literature-Ralph Touchett, Stephen Dedalus, Hans Castorp-demonstrates his su- periority to the traditions into which he is to be inducted-bank- ing, the priesthood, engineering-by renouncing them and bowing 6 I discuss Clemens's burlesque techniques in "The Deadpan on Simon Wheeler," Southwest Review, XLI (Summer, 1956).</page><page sequence="7">Of Man and the River 101 out. Their "failure" is the stigmata of an inner glorification. Those "who never lost," Emily Dickinson says, "are unprepared / A coronet to find." Clemens's independence of this firmly intrenched pessimism is so decisive that it has led some of his best critics to accuse him of falsifying the flush times of the river. Bernard De Voto and DeLancey Ferguson, for example, have felt that Old Times is romantic because Clemens ignores the prostitutes and gamblers and what he calls the "moral styes" of such river cities as Natchez Under the Hill.7 The seamy side of life is not, as a matter of fact, wholly passed by; on his first river trip the town boy is taken in by a sharpy to the tune of six dollars. But it is true that such allusions do not alter the book's total impression: the life of a riverman is admirable and good. The difficulty with De Voto's criticism is more than a matter of such detail; it is his assumption, one which he shares with generations of both romanticists and realists, that pessimism is the only tenable outlook on society, that work on the river must ultimately be the sordid story of exploita- tion. Such critics, in their understandable anxiety to discredit the whitewash of the American success myth, see any joy in the world's work as compromise; they rule out the very possibility of success and optimism. Such assumptions, whatever their justification, are disabling to an appreciation of Clemens. He passes over the shod- diness of the trade and the jerry-built boats, not for any sympathy with the empire-builders, but because he has his eye on the much more exciting life of the "lordly riverman," and because for him the type who most illuminates river work, the pilot, is a success, not a failure. Optimism shapz-s more than the ending of this book; it is part and parcel of the narrative point of view: it is the cub's eagerness to secure the approval of Bixby and the crew, his feeling that being a "lightning" pilot is an understandable and fine ambi- tion, and not the questionable itch to come out on top in a cut- throat competition. The achievement of this set of sketches is that it convinces even the sceptical eye that this optimism is justifiable and necessary and not time-serving, not the exploitable naivete of a boy's view of the Mississippi. For the book is not designed to be a valentine to the idyl of boyhood.

The conception of reality which emerges from these encounters is an arresting one. Reality is defined by the contest between the skill of the rivermen and the danger of the river. The river is inviting and mysterious, hence the opening spectacle of it as "very still and brilliant and lonely." It is dramatic with meaning as a stubborn and protean challenge to man's control. The devil-may- care serenity of the pilot as viewed by the passenger on the deck is belied by the sweat and anxiety of his actual work. Here, for example, is how the river looks from the pilot house: "As long as that hill over yonder is only one hill, I can boom right along the way I'm going; but the moment it splits at the top and forms a V, I know I've got to scratch to starboard in a hurry, or I'll bang this boat's brains out against a rock; and then the moment one of the prongs of the V swings behind the other, I've got to waltz to larboard again, or I'll have a misunderstanding with a snag that would snatch the keelson out of the steamboat as neatly as if it were a sliver in your hand."8 "Boom, split, scratch, bang, swing, waltz, snatch"-the language bespeaks a relationship which can be harsh and keenly alive, a wrestling which puts man on his mettle. The rivermen's work must measure up to the river's lively compulsion. But this neces- sity is not felt as an oppressive and dominating determinism. Occasionally, to be sure, the river does take on the animistic pro- portions of a perverse antagonist whose: banks cave and change constantly, whose snags are always hunting up new quarters, whose sandbars are never at rest, whose channels are forever dodging and shirking, and whose obstructions must be confronted in all nights and all weathers without the aid of a single lighthouse or a single buoy.9 But such anthropomorphism is a passing note. Ultimately the river is neither friend nor enemy; nature is not personified nor deified at all, but accepted as necessity. The conquest of the river defines a world strikingly at odds with nineteenth-century Weltschmerz, and it is not a world which 8 Life on the Mississippi, p. 76. ' Ibid., p. 86.</page><page sequence="9">Of Man and the River 103 has been falsified by ignoring the inner sandbars and cutting cur- rents of the mind. The cub's airy notion that piloting is a lark and a matter of swagger must be dispelled; the bouts of burlesque rescue us from his twin delusions-sentimental raptures and cyni- cism. Bixby at one point dashes the boy's bravado ambition to be a pilot by telling him he must commit to memory: "the exact spot and the exact marks the boat lay in when we had the shoalest water, in every one of the five hundred shoal places between St. Louis and New Orleans; and you mustn't get the shoal sounding and marks of one trip mixed up with the shoal soundings and marks of another, either, for they're not often twice alike." The boy's stunned response to this is that " 'When I get so that I can do that, I'll be able to raise the dead, and then I won't have to pilot a steamboat to make a living.' " He decides to retire. Bixby is contemptuous of such luxuries of depression: "'Now drop that! When I say I'll learn a man the river, I mean it. And you can depend on it, I'll learn him or kill him.' "1 Impersonal work governs the relationships of the rivermen, an objectivity whose value may be contrasted with the anarchism and egocentric isolation of romantic individualism. During the boy's first river trip and while still a passenger he particularly admired "the big stormy mate" and was anxious to secure his notice. In the process of setting a spar, the mate roared out an order for somebody to bring him a capstan bar, and the boy leaped at the opportunity: "I sprang to his side and said: 'Tell me where it is-I'll fetch it!' " The mate is floored. "He even stopped swear- ing. He stood and stared down at me. It took him ten seconds to scrape his disjointed remains together again. Then he said im- pressively: 'Well, if this don't beat h--l!' "'" The attitude and ejaculation register a complex criticism-amazement that anyone should want to do hard work for which he is not to be paid and which in any case he does not know how to do: but mainly it is amused contempt for the boy's attempt to curry personal favor- as if one could buy with adulation the respect owing only to ability and performance. "'There's only one way to be a pilot,' Bixby remarks elsewhere, "'. . . you have to know "the river" just 0Ibid., pp. 76-77. "Ibid., p. 50.</page><page sequence="10">104 Nineteenth-Century Fiction like ABC.' "12 His unshakeable authority derives from his certain knowledge of this necessity. There is neither "malice sinewing" this reality, as Ahab is prone to believe in Moby Dick, nor, as the town had evidently taught the boy, a sunny nineteenth-century Providence. The mark of Bixby's harmony with this reality, inner and outer, is his gentleness. He is concerned, as he says, not to discourage the boy, but "'You see, this has got to be learned; there isn't any getting around it.' " When the boy, overwhelmed by the mass of detail he must commit to memory, says he thinks he was a fool when he went into this business, Bixby agrees. "'Yes, that is true. And you are yet. But you'll not be when you've learned it.' " And when the cub laments that he never will be able to learn it, the pilot says, " 'I will see that you do.'" Personal indulgence would distort this relationship, for it involves not only these two but also the shifting and changing river and what Bixby describes as "'the staggering weight of all the re- sponsibilities connected with the position.' " A clinching exhibition of the pilot's ability occurs in the face of the scepticism of both the cub and a group of visiting pilots. Bixby is approaching a difficult "crossing"; that is, a place where the boat must be piloted from one channel in the river to another. This particular crossing is intricate and hazardous at any time, and held by the visiting pilots to be impossible at night. They hope to make it before dark, since if they do not the boat will have to tie up for the night. When the sun sets they regretfully snap their watches shut and start to leave the pilot house. But when the bell for landing does not sound they realize with amaze- ment that Bixby is going to try the crossing anyway. The stars come out, and then even they disappear. Bixby calls for the leads- men to give him the shallowing depth of the river. The strange cries of " 'Ma-a-r-k three! M-a-r-k three! Half twain M-a-r-k twain!' " rise from the deck. The pilots watch intently and breath- lessly while Bixby swings the boat over dangerous reefs and through piloting marks which are "utterly invisible" to the cub. The tension of the scene is skillfully husbanded-the black of the night, Bixby "silent and intent as a cat" on his work and speaking only through the tube to the engineer, the knot of awed and at- tentive pilots, and the chorally punctuating weird calls of the '2 Ibid., p. 59.</page><page sequence="11">Of Man and the River 105 leadsmen. As they drift with the engines cut into the "blacker gloom" of the island which marks the worst shoal, one of them whispers, "'She'll not make it!'" The depth of the water is less than seven feet. We touched bottom! Instantly Mr. Bixby set a lot of bells ringing, shouted through the tube, "Now, let her have it-every ounce you've got!" then to his partner [at the wheel], "Put her hard down! snatch her! snatch her!" The boat rasped and ground her way through the sand, hung upon the apex of disaster a single tremendous instant, and then over she went! And such a shout as went up at Mr. Bixby's back never loosened the roof of a pilot-house before!" When Melville's Ahab defies the white whale, we are aware of multiple contexts of meaning. Bixby's triumphal crossing lacks this kind of symbolic significance and may at first seem barren of point. But if the mode of art is feeling, drama rather than argu- ment, then Clemens's departures from the literary practices of romanticism are not indefensible. Nothing impedes the concrete impact of the action. Thematic points are in the foreground, on the surface, and the action itself, this demonstration of success, is direct rather than symbolic and veiled. The great panoramnic Weltanschauung which rolled everything up into overwhelming questions has vanished, but we are brought back from the intense inane to the immediate and living. This short circuit of the familiar nineteenth-century doubts and soul-searchings has occasioned Van Wyck Brooks's well known charges against Clemens; that is, that he sold out, that he con- veniently averts his gaze from the dark satanic mills which pre- occupied the romantics and ignores the sordid post-bellum scram- ble for wealth and power."4 Measuring Clemens by the standards of Emersonian romantic individualism, Brooks is sure that his 1 Ibid., p. 68. Clemens's pen name is usually thought to signify the lazy repose of a comfortable depth of water, but the leadsmen were not called into use unless there was danger of shallow water. 1 Van Wyck Brooks, The Ordeal of Mark Twain (New York, 1920), pp. 212- 213. Clemens's humor "degrades, 'takes down,' punctures, ridicules as pretentious and absurd everything of a spiritual, aesthetic and intellectual nature the recogni- tion of which, the participation in which, would retard the smooth and simple operation of the business man's mind." And later: "in his books about childhood, he enables the reader to become 'a boy again, just for a day,' to escape from the emotional stres3 of maturity to a simpler and more primitive moral plane." The passage is not changed in the revised edition of 1934.</page><page sequence="12">106 Nineteenth-Century Fiction lack of Sturm und Drang is the reflex of spiritual flaccidity. This uneasiness is not difficult to understand, for Clemens's humor in- volves a monumental shift from acknowledged literary values. But Brooks fails to come to grips with Clemens. He disdains the tradition in which Clemens works-the raw, crude, but powerfully direct and genuine humor of the Southwest-and he ignores the possibility that art may have another and equally potent operation besides ideological criticism in the style of transcendentalism. Clemens provided a name for his times which the twentieth cen- tury has found felicitous, the Gilded Age. One can hardly become aware of his scorn for the complacently wealthy and pious tourists of The Innocents Abroad or his uncondescending sympathy and affection for the humbly placed throughout his early work, his direct satire on Benjamin Franklin, or on Thomas Hart Benton and Horace Greeley with their glittering slogans of westward expansion, one cannot gather all this in and claim him a naive apologist for the robber barons. Neither, however, do his values sort with the transcendental and alienated individualism of Emer- son, Melville, Whitman, and Dickinson. It is his breathtaking detachment from the accepted literary tradition which troubles Brooks, and it is exactly this which is the source of his great vi- tality. Official New England culture represented, at bottom, Prot- estant, Republican, romantic individualism. Clemens cancels out the assumption on which this culture rests by refusing to entertain the traditional Cartesian contradiction between individual and community. The basis for his work is neither conventional com- petitive "rugged" individualism nor romantic critical individu- alism, neither Carnegie nor Emerson, but brotherhood and com- munity; and not a utopian community like Brook Farm, but the living fact of work with others on the Mississippi. The vernacular community in which his standpoint is grounded in Old Times had in his day considerable independence of the pulls of com- petitive individualism which dominated official genteel culture, and a history of unprecedented material and ideological freedom, growing out of the leveling and equalitarian traditions of the American Revolution. Bixby, the mate, and the crew, like the Nevada miners, MVissouri compositors, and Pacific sailors in Clem- ens's other books, can be identified with their work without feel- ing hypocritical, or corrupted and engulfed in guilt.</page><page sequence="13">Of Man and the River 107 In the concluding chapters of Old Times Clemens says that as a pilot he had greater independence and freedom than a king. If I have seemed to love my subject [that is, piloting] it is no surprising thing, for I loved the profession far better than any I have followed since, and I took a measureless pride in it. The reason is plain: a pilot, in those days, was the only unfettered and entirely independent human being that lived in the earth. This sweeping statement was not devised solely to ring down the curtain on the Atlantic articles; he had said much the same years earlier to a boyhood friend who had also become a pilot. "In genuine manliness," he wrote Will Bowen, the pilots "assay away above the common multitude." Compared to them, kings and senators, bankers and priests, are the slaves of "the world's will and the world's opinion." "The only real, independent and genu- ine gentlemen in the world," he concluded, "go quietly up and down the Mississippi river, asking no homage of any one, seeking no popularity, no notoriety, and not caring a damn whether school keeps or not.''15 What this independence means is the freedom to work without compromising with genteel respectability, with- out enlisting in the rat race of competitive display evident in the House Beautiful. He contrasts piloting with writing (and thereby anticipates Einstein's bitter contrast between the freedom of plumbers and intellectuals): "We write frankly and fearlessly, but then we 'modify' before we print." III. FIGURES IN A LANDSCAPE The linguist Jean Piaget accounts for the development of lan- guage by associating it with man's struggle for the mastery of reality in community work. Clemens's style suggests exactly this relationship to reality. It is a style rich with figures of speech growing out of work. The pilot "waltzes" the boat to larboard to avoid " 'a misunderstanding with a snag that would snatch the keelson out of this steamboat as neatly as if it were a sliver in your hand.'" The steamer passenger may or may not notice a faint dimple on the surface of the river, "but to the pilot," he says, 15 From the Sandwich Islands, August 25, 1866, in Mark Twain's Letters to Will Brown, edited by Theodore Hornberger (Austin, Texas, 1941), p. 13.</page><page sequence="14">108 Nineteenth-Century Fiction that was an italicized passage; indeed, it was more than that, it was a legend of the largest capitals, with a string of shouting exclamation points at the end of it, for it meant that a wreck or a rock was buried there that could tear the life out of the strongest vessel that ever floated.1" This intimate and charged involvement between man and thing, "senser" and that whlich is sensed, is in decided contrast to the established enlightenment and romantic style based on contem- plation, wherein poetry, Wordsworth says, is the unconscious over- flow of emotion, and where the aim is to achieve detachment. Clemens draws this contrast with romanticism himself, though not in the same terms, when he contrasts two views of a sunset on the river, a passenger's and the pilot's.'7 The passenger's ex- tended description is filled with the 'speechless raptures" appro- priate to genteel landscape appreciation. But the pilot must learn how these lines and slick places in the water reveal the shape and condition of the river channel; he must read them with exacting precision if he is to keep afloat: that silver streak in the shadow of the forest is the "break" from a new snag, and he has located himself in the very best place he could have found to fish for steamboats; that tall dead tree, with a single living branch, is not going to last long, and then how is a body ever going to get through this blind place at night without the friendly old landmark? One result of learning to be a pilot is the destruction of the ro- mantic landscape: "The romance and the beauty were all gone from the river." Clemens accounts this change a loss, and, con- sidering the marble-topped Victorian theories of beauty, it is not difficult to understand why he hesitates to call what the riverman's style creates beautiful. Tolstoi had much the same difficulty with the word beauty, and finally dismissed it as the hallmark of an aesthetic which thought of art as a viand for an audience of jaded gourmets. Clemens is not so sure of himself: he contrasts the 16 Life on the Mississippi, p. 83. 17 Ibid., p. 83. Leo Marx ("The Pilot and the Passenger: Landscape Conven- tions and the Style of Huckleberry Finn," American Literature, XXVIII [May. 1956] ) makes a full and interesting analysis of the contrasting styles of these two descriptions. He accounts for the superiority here and in Huckleberry Finn by relating it to romantic pastoral and the revolt against those industrial forces symbolized by the steamboat "menacing freedom in this idyllic valley society.' This does not work for the pilot, since what we admire about him is, precisely, the power which grows out of his use of the steamboat. The admirable detail in the language of this passage develops out of his technical skill.</page><page sequence="15">Of Man and the River 109 passenger's and the pilot's descriptions and remarks that "All the grace, the beauty, the poetry, had gone out of the majestic river!" As a matter of fact, though Clemens is not unskillful at concocting conventional landscape description, the pilot's view is easily the superior of the two. It is alive with an active sensibility; details are put to dramatic uses-the one-limbed tree is a "friendly old landmark." The subjectivity is no longer gratuitous, as it is in the passenger's description, but motivated and differentiated by the pilot's work. The excitement of control bubbles under the surface of his style. We are apt to think of work in terms of the curse in the Garden, or as a cunning Franklinesque business of putting money in your purse, but the life on the Mississippi Clemens admired is certainly not work of this kind. The book's presiding attitude is one of re- laxed grace-not idleness, but the earned luxury of lassitude. The pilot can loll at the wheel-should, in fact, to relax from the ardu- ous strain and anxiety of his responsibilities when he can, but he is not a patrician drone. Carlyle's doctrine of salvation through work would probably have inspired Clemens's derision, but the scorn would have arisen from a feeling that for the riverman there is no choice involved in the matter. The contrast between the white town and the brilliant river, to return to my point of departure, is not, then, the typical ro- mantic conflict between civilization and nature. Actually Clemens was hostile to Cooper and to communion with nature. His humor is often at its best when it is directed against romantic primitives like the Noble Redskin, the Innocent Child, and Man's Best Friend the animal. The white town in Old Times has none of the inenacing energy which civilization in the settlements has for Cooper; the riverman's relation to the town is one of amused detachment rather than bristling antagonism. Nor, on the other hand, is the river conceived as Nature transcending and rejuve- nating the individual's petty life; it is not "sublime." The work transcends; the river is no more than the occasion for that which makes the town seem dead by comparison. "Dead" recurs in the descriptions of the rural settlements along the riverbank. During floods which make the chutes and backwaters navigable, the steamboats bruslh past a stagnation even more miserable than the</page><page sequence="16">110 Nineteenth-Century Fiction town's, "wretched little farms, and wretcheder little log cabins" surrounded by crazy rail fences sticking a foot or two above the water, with one or two jeans-clad, chills-racked, yellow-faced male miserables roosting on the top rail, elbows on knees, jaws in hands, grinding tobacco and discharging the result at floating chips through crevices left by lost teeth; while the rest of the family and the few farm-animals were huddled together in an empty wood-flat riding at her moorings close at hand.'8 For these people the floods may even be considered "kindly dis- pensations, for they at least enabled the poor things to rise from the dead now and then, and look upon life when a steamboat went by." At most what Clemens feels for these yeomen of the Mississippi Valley, scions of nature in the official culture, is pity. The great value of Clemens's view lies in his conception of man as drawing vitality and energy, not from nature, either inner or outer, but from the community to which he belongs, the river- men. If we are to understand his humor, we can no longer employ the oversimplified modern dichotomy of positive individual and negative society; we must at least distinguish between the collec- tive created for commercial conventional ends-the white town- and a direct purposeful community in which the individual is stimulated and nurtured and fulfilled-the river community. The pilot is not proud and solitary, superior to his work and competi- tive with his fellows; he is part of the crew-unthinkable without the crew; he is sustained and encouraged by the tradition which he has inherited and by the Pilots' Association which defends his profession and provides him with a means of pooling his skill and knowledge with others. The great, muddy river gives such an indi- vidual a strong stomach: "It is good for steamboating," Clemens says in a passage which suggests the ancient worship of the Nile's fertility, "and good for drink; but it is worthless for all other purposes, except baptizing." As a member of this community power the riverman becomes a paragon of strength. The Pet Child of Calamity, a raftsman in a chapter originally designed for Huckleberry Finn, is drunk with this power when he jumps up, kicks his heels together and crows 1" Ibid., p. 95.</page><page sequence="17">Of Man and the River 111 in the traditional ecstatic ritual of the half-hoss, half-alligator Salt River Roarer: "Whoo-oop! bow your neck and spread, for the kingdom of sorrow's a-coming! Hold me down to the earth, for I feel my powers a-work- ing! whoo-oop! I'm a child of sin, don't let me get a start! . . . I'm the man with a petrified heart and biler-iron bowels! The massacre of isolated communities is the pastime of my idle moments, the destruction of nationalities the serious business of my life! The boundless vastness of the great American desert is my enclosed property, and I bury my dead on my own premises!"'9 The "boundless vastness" is perhaps reminiscent of the standard romantic image of the West as salvation through nature, but Cooper and Whitman would never have entertained the notion of mechanical physiology-"biler-iron bowels"-with anything less than a shudder. The significance of the machine loses, in Clemens, its traditional Frankensteinian associations and is naturally assimi- lated as the product of human work. Pet Child's personal claim to this community power is only incidental. This ode in praise of his power as a raftsman has the epic and mythic impersonality of the folk tales of the rivermen and their demigod keelboatman, Mike Fink. Exaggeration is functional here, both to the strategy of the tall tale and to a community potency which transcends the individual. What Clemens perceives in these ritual claims, so inappropriate to the isolated individual (a moment later when the Pet Child is forced into an actual fight he fails miserably), is a celebration of community. There are, certainly, all kinds of danger that the individual be swallowed up in the collective, but Clemens, as a humorist, is concerned rather to celebrate solidarity than to warn us of its dangers. The riverman belongs. He is related to the crew, to the rich traditions of river work, and, distantly, to the ancient and undifferentiated, uncommercialized, folk community. The competitive exhibitionism which rots the community of the white town is short-circuited. Herein is the source of the lusty strength of the raftsman and of the unfettered independence which the cub feels when he has served his apprenticeship and is accepted as a member of the crew.
