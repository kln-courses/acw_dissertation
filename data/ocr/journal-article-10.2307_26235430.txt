<plain_text><page sequence="1">ESSAY A Sense of Place Jews, Blacks, and White Gentiles in the American South by David Goldfield s quintessential outsiders, Jews have developed a sixth sense in taking cues on public behavior from the host society. Over the centuries, their successful assimilation and at times even their survival have often depended on blending in with the Gentile population; they have had to balance the pursuit of their culture and religion with the necessity of maintaining a low profile. This tension between preservation and assimilation has lessened in recent decades in the United States, but it is still a part of Jewish life in the South. For the South remains the most con servative and evangelical Protestant region of the country, as well as the section in which rural culture has the strongest hold. Jewish religious, social, and settle ment traditions are very different from those of the dominant culture, and Jewish success in the South prior to and even to some degree after the civil rights move ment depended on minimizing these differences. The Jewish "place" in southern life—their role as perceived by white and black Gentiles—has been a key factor in determining Jewish-Gentile relations in the South. As the historically dominant group in southern society, white Gentiles be came accustomed to "placing" individuals as a way of ordering a chaotic and often violent region. Placing drew upon a long list of characteristics including race, family name, birthplace, religion, occupation, and education. Placing also depended on conformity to the customs of a given rural area, town, or city at a particular point in time. To know one's place and to act accordingly was impor tant for getting along in the South, especially before the civil rights era. Race remained a fundamental element in placing individuals. Although white southerners distinguished blacks by color, status, gender, and adherence to racial etiquette, African Americans occupied the lowest place in southern society re gardless of other variables. White Gentiles usually viewed Jews as white, but Jews initially failed to meet most of the other criteria of placing. Once they established themselves, however, and proved their fealty to local customs, Jews began to move up on the place list, though seldom if ever to the topmost rung. Mobility for Jews was possible, even probable; for blacks, rare, if ever. 58</page><page sequence="2">Jewish-owned Rich and Bros. Dry Goods Store in the iSSos, Atlanta, Georgia.

Sephardim in the colonial era, German Jews in the nine teenth century, and Eastern European (mainly Russian) Jews thereafter brought distinctive traditions that did not always blend into one happy community. De nominational preferences — Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform—further di vided southern Jewry. Southern white and black Gentiles also included distinct social, denominational, and ethnic groups. These variations qualify some of the generalizations in this essay. But, as journalists and historians have noted, although there are many Souths, there is also One South, a common set of assumptions re volving around race, religion, and, most important, history. An individual's place within southern society originates from those common assumptions. A Sense of Place 5 9 Jewish-owned Rich and Bros. Dry Goods Store in the iSSos, Atlanta, Georgia.

Centuries of restrictions in Europe have made them an urban and mercantile people. Southerners have exalted rural life and looked with suspicion on cities and mercantile pursuits that they have associated with modernism, exploitation, and alien ideas. For the past century, the South has also been the nation's most evan gelical Protestant region, and, consequently, southern Jews have been either prime targets for conversion or permanent outsiders. Finally, in a region where roots have meant a great deal, Jews were from nowhere. They were a people without a country, wandering the earth to find a home anywhere, yet at home nowhere, seemingly loyal only to themselves. But in the South, things are seldom as they seem. While the South has not al ways been a promised land for the Jewish people, it has been a hospitable region for Jewish aspirations and security. Rarely comprising more than one percent of the region's population at any given time, Jewish southerners have attained eco nomic and political influence far beyond their meager numbers. This positive state of affairs is a result of three factors. First, because of their small numbers, Jews rarely appeared threatening to other southerners. Second, the behavior of southern Jews has tended to mute their differences from the host society. Final ly, race matters most in the South. The ethnic cleavages that defined northern cities were much less relevant in the South. Even if some southern Gentiles con sidered the Jews not quite white, they were not black either, and this fact was their greatest advantage in adapting to the region. None of these moderating elements, however, has enabled Jewish southerners to overcome fully the distinctions between themselves and white Gentiles. In deed, the South has always been ambivalent about Jews, sometimes embracing those in their midst but railing against "foreign" or Yankee Hebrews; at once ex uding an almost embarrassing philo-Semitism while at the same time propagating the crudest stereotypes of Jews. The South is a land of great irony, and the place of Jews in that land reflects that characteristic very clearly. Few elements of southern culture demonstrate this ambivalence, even contra diction, better than evangelical Protestantism. Consider, for example, the recent resolution passed by the Southern Baptist Convention to reconstitute the mission to the Jews. On the one hand, the resolution acknowledges the Jews' importance to evangelical prophecy; on the other, the thrust of the proposal is to obliterate the Jewish religion. Or, take Sunday school lessons.

Despite these ambiguities, evangelical Protestantism shares a number of tenets with Judaism. Civic and reli gious leaders in the South have periodically acknowl edged the Judaic roots of evangelical Protestantism. For two decades after the Civil War, three-ter m North Caro lina governor Zebulon Vance toured the country giving a speech about Jews called "The Scattered Nation." He noted that "all Christian churches are but off-shoots from or grafts upon the old Jewish stock. Strike out all of Judaism from the Christian church and there re mains nothing but an unmeaning superstition."1 Both evangelical southerners and Jews have considered themselves "Chosen People," special groups anointed by God to carry his work forward and reap the benefits in the afterlife despite set backs on earth. As W. J. Cash observed in The Mind of the South, the relationship is more than parallel; it is an acknowledged bond between the two religions. On southerners' belief that they will prevail, he wrote, "Did He not suffer the first Chosen People to languish in captivity, to bleed under the heel of Marduk and Ashur and Amon and Baal?"2 Evangelical southerners were well-versed in the Old Testament, perhaps more so than other Protestant denominations. They have interpreted the Jewish State of Israel as the fulfillment of biblical prophecy on the in-gathering of Jews in the Holy Land. Also, southern Protestantism, like Judaism, is inextricably bound to the culture of the people. There are numerous incidents throughout southern history that demonstrate the philo-Semitism of evangelicals: The close cooperation and proximity of Jew ish and evangelical religious institutions in many southern towns and cities; how Gentile store owners closed on Saturday morning in early-twentieth-century Woodville, Mississippi, to hear the preaching of an itinerant rabbi; and, as histo rian Eli Evans narrated, how eastern North Carolina farmers came to his grand father's store to be blessed in the "original Hebrew." Or how a Methodist in Port Gibson, Mississippi, purchased and restored an old synagogue in 1988 simply be cause, as he explained, "The Jewish heritage is deep rooted here, and that's where we all come from, after all, back to Abraham."3 Finally, both southern evangelical Protestantism and Judaism have been rela tively immune to theological fads. In 1909 Harvard's Charles W. Eliot, in a speech called "The Religion of the Future," anticipated some of the religious trends of the late twentieth century, but not as practiced by Jews or southern evangelicals Many southern Gentiles learn early in their lives that Jews are Christ-killers.

He predicted that the new religion would have "no worship, express or im plied, of dead ancestors, teachers, or rulers" and that, above all, it would not "per petuate the Hebrew anthropomorphic representations of God."4 Southerners and Jews have also shared a similar historical perspective that is different from the American view of history as the story of inevitable progress. Both groups conflate time zones: the past so defines the present and future that the three seem to merge together. Traditions, especially family traditions, are very important, and in the literature and music of both cultures the tension between traditions and the modern world is a prominent theme. For this reason, literary critic Lewis Simpson noted, "southern fiction and Jewish fiction have been the most complex and vital expressions of American fiction in this century. Both ex pressions derive from visions in which faith in the American's ability to make his own world has had an entangled confrontation with an experience of memory and history that tells him he cannot do it."5 Perhaps this is one reason for southern writers' fascination with Jewish themes and people, both professionally and personally. Will Percy's relationship with Caroline Stern and Thomas Wolfe's stormy affair with Aline Bernstein are two personal examples. The works of Walker Percy, Robert Penn Warren, Willie Mor ris, William Styron, and Pat Conroy indicate the literary attraction. On southern ers and Jews, Willie Morris has written that "despite the most manifest disparities they have emerged from two similar cultures, buttressed by old traditions of an guish and the promise of justice." Both groups, Morris noted, have "an affinity in the historical disasters of our ancestral pasts." 6 These "ancestral pasts" con tribute to a collective memory that is a key element in maintaining group solidar ity and distinguishing the group from others. Journalist Ben Robertson's com ment about his upbringing in rural upstate South Carolina pertains as much to 62 DAVID GOLDFIELD Governor Luther Hodges (left) with Sara Evans and Durham Major E. J.

I was Southern, I was old."7 Jews and southerners, especially southern writers, share a sense of loneliness. This feeling of enforced detachment or exile derives from their shared view of personal history as separate from the American experience. In Robert Penn War ren's Flood, a novel about the impending inundation of a small Tennessee town situated by a dam, Izzie Goldfarb, a long-deceased resident of Fiddlersburg, func tions as a metaphor for southern loneliness. We first meet Izzie sitting in front of his shop on a summer evening, alternately reading and gazing out at the river, thinking we do not know what but enveloped in a centuries-old loneliness, a weariness of flight and exile. Later in the book, while lead character Brad Tolliver and his friend search for Izzie's grave before the river obliterates it and the town, Tolliver declares, "Hell, the whole South is lonesome. The shared experience . . . that makes the word South is lonesomeness."8 To be a child of history is to be set apart, especially in America where the past is often seen as irrelevant. History has exiled both the southerner and the Jew. As Walker Percy wrote in The Moviegoer, "I am Jewish by instinct. We share the same exile." In an almost identical vein, jour nalist Jonathan Daniels asserted, "For good or for ill, being a southerner is like being a Jew.. . . There is, of course, the sense of exile."9 Campaign picture for Eli Evans, the first Jewish student body president at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 19/7.

Perhaps because of this mutual itinerancy, the attachment to place has at tained almost mythic proportions for both. When Eli Evans took a vial of North Carolina dirt into a New York City delivery room as his son was born, every southerner understood why. It was a gesture that no northerner, Jew or otherwise, would likely make. Thomas Wolfe's rootless character, George Web ber, ironically finds his "place" among the world's most placeless people in the most transient neighborhood in the most placeless city. "Place!" Webber exclaims. "The East Side was a Place—and that was the thing that made it wonderful." Considering the intersection of God and history in the cultures of both groups, it is not surprising that Jews found a welcome home in the South. The lure of the regional culture, so like their own in many ways, facilitated their accul turation and distinguished them from their coreligionists in the North. As Eli Evans flatly stated: "I believe that no one born and raised in the South, even if one moves away physically, can escape its hold on the imagination." Such affinity does not imply a loss of cultural identity. In fact, being southern reinforces Ju daism as Jews have assumed the regional church-going habit, attending syna gogues in much greater frequency and proportion than do their coreligionists in the North.10 The appreciation of and involvement in the regional culture occasionally re sults in some unusual combinations for southern Jews. Food has a strong ritual element for all southerners, Jew and Gentile. Some Jewish families ring in the New Year with hoppin' john, a mixture of black-eyed peas and hog jowls that brings good luck throughout the year. Children participate in public pageants that often have Christian overtones. Alfred Uhry, Adanta-born author of Driving Miss Daisy, recalled that as a boy he enjoyed going on Easter-egg hunts and re ceiving Christmas gifts. As a member of the Adanta Boy Choir, he participated in the annual Easter recital, belting out, "Lord, I want to be a Christian in my heart." In smaller communities, the integration has been more complete. As Alfred O. Hero noted in his survey of southern Jewry more than a generation ago, small town Jews "played poker with the sheriff, fished with the county judge, hunted with the planters, and became leaders of the local Chamber of Commerce, Ro tary, and other service groups."" So thoroughly acclimated have Jews become that some Gentiles have regretted the assimilation. In the 1930s Will Percy complained to David Cohn, his Jewish neighbor in Greenville, Mississippi: "I have a great grievance against southern Jews. It is that they have fallen to the level of Gentiles." He recalled discussing music and literature with local Jews twenty years earlier, "but now," he said, 64 DAVID GOLDFIELD History has exiled both the southerner and the Jew.</page><page sequence="8">"[they] are just like everybody else—nice people and root ers for the home team.

The dividing line of race serves to push the Jewish place not surprising in the South much closer to that of white Gentiles and at , j r 1 some distance to that of blacks. As Jonathan Daniels ^ JeiVSJOUn CI noted, "The direction of racial prejudice at the Negro welcome home in frees the Jew from prejudice altogether—or nearly alto- » ç , gether." In the 1950s the Little Rock White Citizens' ^ ^ Council expelled one of its leaders for anti-Semitism. A Council spokesman explained: "You see, we had to throw him out, because we can't afford to be seen as an anti-Jewish organization. Why, we are having trouble enough just being anti-Negro." As Hodding Carter put it, "It takes perseverance to hate Jews and Negroes and Catholics all at the same time." For white southerners, Jew and Gentile, the South, in short, has been the land of the ethnic meltdown. As historian George B. Tindall observed, "Over the years, all those southerners with names like Kruttschnitt, Kolb, De Bardeleben, ... Toledano, Moise,... or Cheros got melted down and poured back out in the mold of good old boys and girls, if not of the gentry."15 The meltdown, however, has not been complete for Jewish southerners. The very factors that drew Jews and southerners together also pulled them apart and created ambivalent if not downright contradictory Jewish-Gentile relations. Evangelical Protestants may trace their theology to the ancient Hebrews, but they have also viewed Jews as "Christ-killers." They have clashed with Jews over issues such as Sunday-closing laws and school prayer. Also, Talmudic traditions are based on doubt: that is, Judaism is rife with interpretive differences and constant questioning of biblical meaning; debate, analysis, and reinterpretation are expect ed. Evangelical Protestantism, as often practiced in the South, abjures doubt and is uncomfortable with skeptical inquiry. EXCLUSION AND PERSECUTION Tempering factors in national religious life such as religious diversity and the strict separation of church and state have been less evident in the South. The re ligious monopoly of evangelical Protestantism and the historical resistance of Jews to conversion led to mutual distrust and suspicion. During the PTL scandals of the late 1980s, when Jim Bakker and Jerry Falwell struggled for control of the A Sense of Place 65</page><page sequence="9">Leo Frank at the time of his trial for the murder of Mary Phagan, Atlanta, Georgia, ca. 1913.

Courtesy of the Atlanta History Center. ministry, the most telling canard that the Bakker forces used against Falwell was that he might have Jewish blood.14 Some white southerners perceived Jews as sufficiently alien to place them on a par with blacks, or even worse. The lynching of Leo Frank in 1915 jolted Jewish southerners, and its memory hovered over Jewish life in the South through much of this century. More than any other event, the Frank lynching demonstrated that acceptance, however widespread, and success, however attainable, were qualified. The lynching reinforced the importance of vigilance and circumspection as the cost for maintaining a comfortable life in the region, and it also affected Jewish relations with African Americans. Leo Frank, a New York Jew, managed a pencil factory in Atlanta. The plant employed many young white girls from surrounding farms and towns. The girls worked at low wages amid filthy conditions with litde privacy, and rumors circu lated that supervisors traded promotions and better pay for sexual favors. These working conditions were typical in the South at this time. The rapid urban and industrial growth of the South during the early twentieth century, coupled with declining farm income uprooted families, removed children to the workplace away from the supervision of parents and placed employers in positions of power over youngsters. Many working-class white families both feared and resented the new urban, industrial order and its implications for family life. Thirteen-year old Mary Phagan typified many of the workers in the pencil factory. Her family had lost their farm and worked as tenants. She had moved to Adanta to help sup port her family. On Confederate Memorial Day 1913, someone robbed and mur 66 DAVID GOLDFIELD Leo Frank at the time of his trial for the murder of Mary Phagan, Atlanta, Georgia, ca. 1913.

Frank, a northern urban Jew who employed poor, white Gentile southern girls, became the convenient focus of the investigation. He was arrested, charged, tried, and sentenced to death for the murder, largely on the tes timony of a black janitor with a criminal record. Much of the evidence pointed to the janitor, and not to Frank, as the killer. immunity from the fury of white supremacy. That a prosperous manager would rob and then kill a poor young employee made little sense, but rumors sur faced that Mary had been raped, a charge unsubstantiated by the medical examiner's report. The rumor, taken as fact, fueled a torrent of anti-Semitic rhetoric about lustful Jews ravishing young white Christian girls. Georgia politi cian Tom Watson described the pencil factory as "a Jew ish convent as lascivious as a Catholic monastery."1' What made the case more bizarre was that white public opinion ignored the mounting evidence against the black janitor at a time when the image of black fiends raping white women had spurred a frenzy of lynching in the South. The whole affair embarrassed Atlanta's leading white citizens, and they sup ported a movement to convince the governor to at least commute Frank's death sentence. At great personal and political peril, Governor John Slaton did just that. But a group of twenty-five men, calling themselves the "Knights of Mary Pha gan," pulled Frank from his cell in August 1915, drove to Marietta, Mary's home town, and lynched their prisoner. The Leo Frank lynching reverberated throughout southern Jewry, particularly in Atlanta. Josephine Joel, a Jewish high school student in Atlanta in 1915, re called that so great was the fear of anti-Semitic terrorism when Governor Slaton commuted Frank's sentence that many Jewish families packed children and women off to stay with relatives in other parts of the country. Josephine's father sent his entire family to live with relatives in Birmingham. When Josephine re turned to Atlanta, she noted in her diary that her French teacher took special care to make her welcome. The teacher was Mattie Slaton, the governor's sister.16 Although Josephine's life returned to normal, and Atlanta's Jews weathered the crisis without any diminution in their status or influence, the Frank lynching served as a lesson that skin color did not give Jewish southerners immunity from the fury of white supremacy. The Frank lynching also reminded Jews that al though they were not black, many southerners did not consider them white. Al most like William Faulkner's mulatto character, Joe Christmas in Light in August, Jewish southerners sometimes wandered in a half life between the legitimacy of being white and the outcast status of being black; being neither, they were suspect 68 DAVID 60LDFIELD</page><page sequence="12">by both. Invisibility, or blending in, proved the best defense; and in the context of southern society prior to the 1960s, invisibility meant the public acceptance of racial segregation, even if doing so tortured the Jewish soul privately. For a Jew to publicly support desegregation was to risk identification with blacks on the place ladder, and such identification could be dangerous. The association of Jewish southerners with blacks in Gentile perceptions heightened Jewish vigilance dur ing periods of racial tension. "It was always an axiom of Jewish life in the South," Eli Evans explained, "that racial trouble meant heated passions and a dangerous atmosphere that was 'bad for the Jews.'"17 White Gentile southerners used more subde ways than violence, however, or its threat to exclude Jews or, more properly, to remind Jews that they were not completely citi2ens of the South. As in the North, certain clubs, resorts, and neighborhoods refused entry to Jews. Some universities, such as Emory in At lanta and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, restricted Jewish ad missions in a few graduate programs.18 More than specific instances, however, an atmosphere prevailed that excluded Jews from full membership in the white southern brotherhood. Louis D. Rubin, Jr., whose southern credentials none would deny, told of a recurring dream he had as a child in Charleston in which Confederate soldiers are patrolling the gate way to Hampton Park. "The soldiers who patrolled the gateway did not bar my Lynching of Leo Frank, Marietta, Georgia, ij August 191J. Courtesy of the Atlanta History Center.

To get into the gar den I should have to go through the Confederate soldiers." Rubin never made the attempt in his dreams, but it symbolized the Rubins' place in Charleston. As Rubin noted, "We were part of [Charleston's] community life. But we were Jewish."19 THE DELICATE DANCE BETWEEN JEWS AND BLACKS An objective of Jewish existence in the South has been to minimize this "but" factor. White southerners have welcomed Jews warmly but conditionally. The Jewish adjustment to their place in southern life involved accepting southern traditions, especially racial customs, so as not to arouse suspicion or confirm prejudices while at the same time maintaining Jewish identity. Jewish life in the South proceeded in a particular cadence, a delicate dance between assimilation and distinctiveness. Relations between Jewish southerners and blacks fit within the context of this dance. Blacks understood the dance because they had internalized many of the steps. They balanced humiliation with self-respect, adopting the appropriate sub servient etiquette in public, while privately building a race-conscious community. Even partial assimilation was never a realistic objective for them as it was for Jewish southerners; southern blacks sought survival and accommodation. Yet Members of Charlotte's Jewish community break groundfor the Amity Country Club, a private Jewish country club, Charlotte, North Carolina, 1947.

Courtesy of the Charlotte Jewish Historical Society.</page><page sequence="14">there was a comparability between black and Jew in the act they played for the dominant white Protestant society. Their relationship reflected both the possibility of shared community and the bitter disappointment of missed op portunities. Blacks generally perceived Jews as whites but different from Gentiles, and, in some cases, even as a different race. Keen to the ways of discrimination, they saw how some Gentiles treated and talked about Jews. In the early 1900s, when the Richmond YMCA accepted Jews as members but not as lodgers, the black Richmond Planet commented, "It may not be too much to say that in some sections of the country the antipathy to Jews in the hotels is almost as marked as it is to Negroes." Blacks often noted approvingly how Jews stuck together and married among themselves. "Only now and then," observed one black writer, "does a Jew cross the line and marry into another race."20 The affinity blacks perceived went beyond mere observation and extended into the same areas that connected Jewish southerners to white Gentiles. Jewish history in general and the Old Testament in particular provided sustenance and proof for the ultimate redemption and success of African Americans. Slaves sang out the lessons of Exodus: "Go Down, / Moses, way down, in Egypt land; / tell old Pharaoh, Let My People Go." One of the leaders of Gabriel's revolt in Vir ginia in 1800 inspired his followers by reminding them of the days "when the Is raelites were in servitude to King Pharaoh and they were taken from him by the power of God."21 Booker T. Washington found "the most fascinating portion of the Bible the story of the manner in which Moses led the Children of Israel out of the house of bondage, through the wilderness, into the promised land." Black novelist Zora Neale Hurston took Old Testament stories as inspiration for some of her early works, especially Moses, Man of the Mountain, a take-off on the Book of Exodus. Hurston admired the Jews for having "a God who laid about [them] when they needed Him." Most blacks took to the Hebrew Scriptures "as a duck to water," according to NAACP official and Howard University professor Kelly Miller.22 Black affinity for Jews reached into the southern secular world. Jewish mer chants and black customers established a close relationship in the Jim Crow era, and most black neighborhoods in the urban South included at least one Jewish owned store. Theodore Coleman, the son of Miss Daisy's chauffeur, recalled moving frequently within Atlanta's black neighborhoods before World War II, but no matter where "we lived, there seemed to be a Jewish store on the cor ner."25 This mercantile relationship began during the Civil War era when Jewish peddlers—"rolling store men," as Alice Walker remembers her parents calling them—penetrated the rural South and provided black families with one of the A Sense of Place 71 White southerners have welcomed Jews warmly but conditionally.</page><page sequence="15">few nonthreatening contacts with whites.24 Some peddlers catered exclusively to a black clientele. Sometimes they "graduated" to a small store in the black section of a town where they provided services most white merchants refused to offer. Jewish merchants occasionally, and always quiedy, extended courtesies to black customers that white Gentile businessmen rarely offered. They allowed black cus tomers to try on clothing and referred to them by "Mr." or "Mrs." Alex Haley noted how Jewish store owners in Henning, Tennessee, treated his parents with re spect. Southern historian Bell Wiley related that the Jewish owner of a dry goods store in his small Tennessee hometown "got most of the black trade because he treated Negroes as human beings and was kindly to them, taking time to joke, in quire about their families and otherwise manifest interest in them." Kelly Miller praised the "tutelage" of Jewish merchants who hired black clerks.2' The clerks often became fluent in Yiddish, a phenomenon northern and foreign travelers found amazing. Jewish businesses advertised heavily in the black press. Prior to i960, before the chain stores gobbled up free enterprise in the urban South, scarce ly a southern black existed who had not spent some time in a Jewish-owned store. Witnessing Jewish business acumen first-hand, blacks often cited Jews as pos itive examples for their own race. In 1876 black Louisiana politician P. B. S. Pinchback offered the example of Jewish upward mobility to an audience of dis couraged Mississippi blacks: "Like you they were once slaves and after they were emancipated they met with persecutions. Generation after generation they fought their oppressors, and backed by principles they believed were right they fi nally emerged victorious. Once despised, they are now leaders of education and princes of the commercial world."26 Two decades later, Booker T. Washington picked up the refrain. He often presented the tale of a Jewish émigré who arrived in a small town near Tuskegee in 1890 with "all of his possessions in a single satchel." He built a store, and within four years his business grossed $ 5 0,000 an nually. Investing some of his profits in land, he acquired a plantation of several hundred acres by the late 1890s. Washington concluded that blacks should emu late "the saving and economical qualities of the Jews."27 Ironically, Washington continued to emphasize the type of vocational education that would preclude most blacks from following the Jewish example, yet the analogy persisted in southern black culture. In 1926 a black editor in Norfolk summarized the Jewish example for his readers: In many ways the Jews show us how to succeed. The Jews have taught the Afro-American people how to organize and stand together; how to make money and how to save and wisely spend it, and how to conquer prejudices, obstacles, by mastering for themselves a place in all of the thought and efforts of our tremendous civilization. . . . How do they do it? They do it by sticking together; by taking a commanding part in the trade and finance of the world 72 DAVID GOLDFIELD</page><page sequence="16">Benjamin Silverstein's clothing store, Charlotte, North Carolina, 1913. Most Jewish southerners resided in cities and many were shopkeepers. Courtesy of the Charlotte Jewish Historical Society. and by going into all of the intellectual fields where money and influence are possible to be made.28 Although blacks acknowledged that Jewish southerners were different in some positive ways from other southern whites, the dividing lines of race, class, and culture tempered black perceptions. Black and white southern Gentiles shared a tradition of anti-Semitism that existed alongside a tradition of philo-Semitism. In some respects the origins of black anti-Semitism reflected the southern heritage of blacks more than their racial background; in others, it related direcdy to the Jewish response to blacks. Despite the religious and commercial affinities, blacks grew up with grave doubts about Jews. Black novelist Richard Wright acknowl edged that growing up in Arkansas, "an attitude of antagonism or distrust toward Jews was bred in us from childhood; it was not merely racial prejudice, it was a part of our cultural heritage." In 1945 the Nashville-based National Baptist Voice, a black newspaper, conceded that "Negroes are filled with Anti-Semitism. In any A Sense of Place 7 3</page><page sequence="17">group of Negroes, if the white people are not around, the mention of the Jew calls forth bitter tirades."29 Black hostility toward southern Jews focused on the issues of Judaism and eco nomic exploitation. After 1800 many slaves converted to evangelical Christianity, and though black southerners derived much from the Old Testament for their purposes, they also imbibed the prevailing notion of Jews as Christ-killers. Richard Wright's initial distrust of Jews emerged, as he explained, "because we had been taught at home and in Sunday school that Jews were 'Christ killers.'" Al though most slave spirituals exalted Old Testament prophets, one included the following lines: "The Jews killed poor Jesus, an' laid him in a tomb. / He 'rose, he 'rose, and 'went to heaven in a cloud."30 The familiar relationship between Jewish shopkeepers and black customers often bred contempt, reflecting differences of both class and race. Black leaders, such as Booker T. Washington who praised Jewish ambition publicly (many of his benefactors were Jewish), worried privately that "we are getting our trade too much centered in the hands of a few Jews." At the same time, black editor T. Thomas Fortune, who grew up in Florida, blamed Jewish merchants for squeezing white planters who, in turn, exploited black laborers. In the 1930s Kelly Miller traced the origins of exploitation to ancient Egypt, where "Jewish servant women borrowed earrings and finger rings of their Egyptian mistresses [and] set up their husbands in the jewelry business."51 Some of these remarks were tinged with the bitterness of betrayal: the feeling that Jews had traded Durham mayor "Mutt" Evans's mother, Jennie Nachamson, founded the United Dollar Stores, Co. in 1924. When Evans took over, he developed a chain of stores that later became Evans United Department Stores. Durham store, ca. ipj/. Special Collections Library, Duke University.

As black educator Horace Mann Bond noted in 1965, "much of the sharpest feeling among Negroes about Jews arises from a feeling that this man has especially let you down; he, of all men, ought to know what it was like; and how it had been."'2 The dance that Jewish southerners performed to keep their place in southern society precluded a close relation ship with blacks. In the triangular relationship between Jew and black and white Gentile, southern cultural tradi tions, including religion and race, drew Jewish southerners closer to other whites. The dance required Jewish south erners to maintain a low profile, especially with respect to race, for to call attention to themselves meant to call attention to their differ ences. And to sympathize with blacks on racial matters would reinforce the white Gentiles' perceptions of the affinity of blacks and Jews. Eli Evans, who is gen erally positive about his family's life in the South, admitted that "the Jews in the South have internalized a deep lesson: that the best way to survive was to be quiet about their presence."53 Silence even extended to not speaking out on anti Semitism for fear of being linked in the Gentile mind with blacks. Nowhere was this silence more evident than in the area of race relations. A sur vey of the Nashville Jewish newspaper between 1939 and 1949 revealed that the paper discussed racial discrimination just four times and briefly at that. And when editors commented on racial matters, they often repeated the views of the larger white community. In the process of wishing for a white hope to defeat black heavyweight champion Joe Louis, an editorial asserted, "The color line is one which the colored folk may never hope to cross as a race, but the colored folk have given us some whom we are proud to claim as citizens."34 Even when Nash ville Jews performed good deeds on behalf of the city's black community, they did not publicize them. During World War II, the Nashville chapter of the Na tional Council of Jewish Women (NCJW) operated a day-care center for black children. Nashville's white Gentile community displayed no similar benevolence. The city's Jewish newspaper made no mention of the day-care center, although several major articles appeared on NCJW participation in funding a nonsectarian children's hospital. The latter demonstrated, as one NCJW member asserted, that Jews are "contributing agents to the community in which we live." The NCJW never commented on the day-care center.35 During the civil rights era many Jews remained on the sidelines, even if pri vately they cheered black protest. In smaller towns in the Deep South, Jews rarely spoke out. As one Meridian, Mississippi, Jew put it in the 1950s, "We have to work quietly, secredy. We have to play ball." Jews were so successful in maintain ing their silence that white southerners had few clues about Jewish views on race A Sense of Place 7 5 Some African Americans bitterly believed that Jem had traded friendship for racial solidarity.</page><page sequence="19">relations. Although polls revealed that Jewish southerners supported civil rights initiatives more than other white southerners, only 15 percent of Gentiles polled in a 1959 survey believed that Jewish southerners favored integration; a whop ping 67 percent replied that they had no idea about Jewish racial views.36 Equally as frustrating for blacks, some Jews seemed unconscious of black dis tress. David Cohn wrote of Greenville in the 1930s that bigots formed only "a tiny minority" of the town. Did Delta blacks feel that way? During the civil rights era, southern Jewish leaders often confronted their northern brethren and either warned them out of town or implored them to remain silent. A Jewish political leader in the Deep South advised northern coreligionists to stay away, assuring them that "there is no race problem here except when it is created from the out side."" This is not to say that Jews failed to respond positively to black civil rights ini tiatives. Even before the civil rights era, prominent Jews moved to the liberal edge of community sentiment, especially in the larger cities of the South. Early in the century southern Jews played an important role in the Committee on Interracial Cooperation. Southern chapters of the NCJW supported Jessie Daniel Ames's Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching. And though Alfred Uhry's grandmother thought that blacks were like children at times, she supported their right for equal, though segregated, education, a rather advanced position in the 1930s. When Jews served on southern school boards in the Jim Crow era, they frequently advocated upgrading black public schools. Occa sionally, southern Jews participated in NAACP lawsuits when their interests matched those of local blacks. In the 1920s, for example, the Savannah Jewish community supported an NAACP protest against housing discrimination. As the black Savannah Tribune noted, Jews were interested in the issue "because of the ef fect the case will have on similar lawsuits involving Jews."38 And, when the civil rights movement emerged in the 1950s, some Jewish clerics joined their black brethren. The post civil rights era in the South has not brought about an appreciable im provement in black-Jewish relations. Although there are numerous examples of cooperation such as the Atlanta Black-Jewish Coalition and Jewish involvement in Habitat for Humanity, a gulf persists between Jewish southerners and blacks reflecting both the racial divisions in the larger society and the anomalous place of Jews in the South. Jews still feel the need to dance the delicate line between assimilation and dis tinctiveness. The merging of the radical Christian right and Klan elements in the South concerns Jewish southerners, and the growing influence of the Christian Coalition also generates uneasiness. When Rabbi James Bennett of Charlotte spoke out against school prayer, an angry letter writer to the local newspaper or dered the rabbi to return to his own country since "America serves God" and the 76 DAVID GOLDFIELD</page><page sequence="20">rabbi does not.59 Rabbi Bennett, incidentally, is from Ft. Worth, Texas. Also in Charlotte, a proposal to move the city's two synagogues to a campus adjacent to the new Jewish Community Center touched off a bitter debate within the Jewish community. The essence of the controversy was whether the grouping would look too much like "clannishness" to the Gentiles and feed a perception that Jews were withdrawing from civic life into their historical ghetto. The plan went forward. Oddly enough, most Gentiles liked the concept, and today more than one-quarter of the center's membership is non-Jewish. Many of the Jewish mem bers are newcomers from the North and their racial attitudes on the whole are lit tle different from those of Jewish southerners; if anything, they are less liberal. The point is that Jewish life in the South remains wonderful but conditional, and race relations still reflect that. W. J. Cash wrote in The Mind of the South that "the Jew, with his universal refusal to be assimilated, is everywhere the eternal Alien; and in the South, where any difference had always stood out with great vividness, he was especially so." A few years after Cash wrote, David Cohn re called, "I was born and raised in a good world. It was far more Gentile than Jew ish, but I never felt alien there, nor was any attempt made to make me feel alien." When Eli Evans undertook research for his book on southern Jews, he discov ered that "Jews were not aliens in the promised land, but blood-and-bones part of southern history."40 So who is right, Cash, the Gentile, or Cohn and Evans, both of whom grew up as Jewish southerners? It may be that they are all correct and reflect the contra dictions inherent in contemporary southern culture: Jews as indelibly part of the South, yet apart from it; as sharing a common culture with white Gentiles, yet often reminded of cultural differences; as historically and culturally sympathetic to black equality, yet distanced by the realities of race in the South and the Jewish instinct for self-preservation in a foreign land.
