<plain_text><page sequence="1">WALLACE STEVENS, ANALOGY, AND TAUTOLOGY: THE PROBLEM OF A SECULAR POETICS BY MATTHEW MUTTER Scholars of Wallace Stevens have long recognized that his poetry is bound up with the loss of his religious faith. The standard critical picture is that, like many Victorians before him, Stevens gave up cer- tain consolatory beliefs in the supernatural and looked to poetry to fill the vacuum of values or meanings. Stevens himself wrote bluntly in a letter of mid-career: "It is a habit of mind with me to be thinking of some substitute for religion."1 These scholars have usually written, however, as if Stevens s secularism were unproblematic. They assume that terms like "religious" and "secular" are transparent, and that the transitional movement between religion and poetry - substitution - is a straightforward process. Secularism is not, for these critics, a distinct and contestable account of the world or mode of inhabiting it. It is merely what we call the awareness of the real world that emerged once we abandoned our metaphysical illusions. It is, to adopt a phrase from Stevens, "the plain sense of things."2 Helen Vendler, for instance, argues that Stevens reorients his "desire" from a "transcendent world" to a secular one. Her preferred synonym for "secular" is "actual": this Stevens "shifts the locus of at- tention away from the transcendent to the actual."3 In other words, Vendler s secular is simply the real, the solid, that which is available to our senses. The religious is not an account of the world, a paradigm for thought and experience, or a set of practices, but an illusory elsewhere. It follows that the secular is not a new imaginary that has displaced the religious account, but a world that is now self-evident. Jahan Ramazani betrays similar assumptions in his eloquent discussion of Stevens s elegy for George Santayana. Stevens, he writes, does not "reach beyond the secular in his version of elegiac apotheosis." Ramazani, too, supposes that the "secular" is simply our common-sense world, a place or state opposed to the supernatural. Yet he supposes something further: that one can take a religious idea - "apotheosis" - and "secularize" it merely by refusing it supernatural reference.4 Robert Rehder adds yet another dimension to this problem. Stevens, he says, made a habit of "advocat- ing poetic solutions in the place of religious ones."5 But Rehder does ELH 78 (2011) 741-768 Â© 2011 by The Johns Hopkins University Press 741</page><page sequence="2">not consider that the very questions toward which these solutions are aimed might derive from distinctly religious or secular perspectives. Stevens, who understood this, often wants us to relinquish the hold that certain questions have on our imaginations, precisely because they are no longer intelligible as questions outside of a religious cosmology. This essay will argue that before one can safely anchor Wallace Stevens in a secular world, one must first understand what he is doing when he borrows particular religious concepts or dispenses with others, and what he means by words like "substitution." Stevens knew that a secular world is not simply what is left over after the gods depart, but a new imaginary that competes with an older one. As we will see, he was himself unsure as to what a transition from a religious to a secular imaginary entailed. But his uncertainty is enormously fruitful, for in exploring the different strategies of that transition, he provides a way into an entire cultural problematic that many have simply forgotten.6 His poetry helps clarify the stakes of the religious - in particular, the Christian - and the secular, as well as the consequences of any move- ment from one to the other. It shows us how this movement may involve the relinquishment of entire frameworks associated with God: all of the attitudes, dispositions, values, concerns, desires, expectations; in short, all the habits of thought, feeling, and imagination that were only intelligible and coherent within that framework. But it also shows us how such a relinquishment might be undesirable or even impossible.7 These are large questions, and this essay cannot attend to all of them. Therefore, after showing how Stevens illuminates the various paradigms of movement from religious to secular forms of imagina- tion, I focus on the problem of language and its relation to a world understood in secular terms. For Stevens, I argue, the self-conscious transition from a Christian worldview to a secular one precipitates a crisis of language in general and poetic expression in particular. He suspects that many linguistic modes that find their most complex ar- ticulation in poetry - metaphor, analogy, and symbol - remain implicitly dependent on, or even generate, religious accounts of the world and human desire. Indeed, Stevens s dedication to the immanent world often favors pre-linguistic experience - the world disclosed by the senses and what he calls "sight" - over experience transfigured by the very element in which he operates: poetry. One of his main strategies for overcoming religious residues in language is the employment of what I call a poetics of tautology. For Stevens, tautology discloses the world in its sheer material existence rather than analogically trans- forming it in a supersensible realm of language, for analogy tends to 742 The Problem of a Secular Poetics</page><page sequence="3">create a transcendent order of desire that obscures the world itself. The problem of language, this essay contends, is a critical field that illuminates Stevens s larger concerns with the transition from a religious to a secular imaginary. The transition is best framed by a letter Stevens wrote to his friend Henry Church, in which he delineated three strategies: The major poetic idea in the world is and always has been the idea of God. One of the visible movements of the modern imagination is the movement away from the idea of God. The poetry that created the idea of God will either adapt it to our different intelligence, or create a substitute for it, or make it unnecessary. These alternatives probably mean the same thing. (L, 378) Stevens undermines his own distinctions by suggesting that these three alternatives - adaptation, substitution, and elimination - "probably mean the same thing." This essay will insist, on the contrary, that they do not. Many of Stevens s poems can be read as dramatizations of these very distinctions. They probe the difficulties that inhere in each strat- egy. Understanding them complicates the picture of what a transition from a religious to a secular framework for experience might entail, and in particular, what secularization means for poetry and aesthetics. Stevens s first option, adaptation, is a revisionist strategy. One takes what began as a religious concept and prunes it, reinterprets it, or translates it in the light of "modern knowledge." Jewish and Chris- tian eschatological doctrines, for instance, which look forward to the transformation and perfection of all things, become modern doctrines of progress.8 One can also revise by placing the concept in a different context, for example, by taking the doctrine of the Fall, or human alienation from God, and turning it into the alienation of subject from object. This was a common procedure, as M. H. Ab rams argued, in Romantic poetics and philosophy: It is a historical commonplace that the course of Western thought since the Renaissance has been one of progressive secularization, but is it easy to mistake the way in which that process took place. . . . The process . . . has not been the deletion and replacement of religious ideas but rather the assimilation and reinterpretation of religious ideas, as constitutive elements in a world view founded on secular premises.9 The problem with this strategy is that it tends to disfigure the origi- nal concepts to the point where they are no longer recognizable. It Matthew Mutter 743</page><page sequence="4">raises questions of legitimacy and coherence that force one to ask whether originally religious ideas remain authentic or intelligible in an alien framework. Stevens was often ambivalent towards the work of adaptation. His poem "Owls Clover," for instance, complains that Marxists, in taking over the eschatological sensibility, have surrepti- tiously preserved religious devotion to an eschatological future while eliminating the God who once guaranteed it: "Everything is dead / Except the future" (154). The second alternative, substitution, overlaps with adaptation but has a different logic. Substitution shifts the attention from the content of the religious idea to the needs and desires that generated it. Supposing that certain needs are immutable, one seeks other agents or structures to satisfy them. According to this logic, it is possible that humans have a need to believe, or to atone for guilt, or to unify their experience in a metaphysical narrative. If these needs produced religious ideas, and those ideas are now obsolete, we can reorient the energy of the needs in the production of a new imaginary. This method is at the heart of Stevens s well-known interest in a "supreme fiction."10 An offshoot of the substitutionary logic that Stevens sometimes found attractive is the Feuerbachian proposal that theology is really anthropology. Turning Hegel on his head, Feuerbach claimed, in The Essence of Christianity, that God was the self-alienation of humanity, rather than the reverse: Man - this is the mystery of religion - projects his being into objectivity, and then again makes himself an object to this projected image of himself thus converted into a subject; he thinks of himself not as an object to himself, but as the object of an object, of another being than himself.11 This insight claims to demystify religion. Humans have taken the work of imagination - the projection of being onto objectivity - an extra step by subjecting themselves to their own imagined objects. But Feuerbach s insight also makes religion a source of true human knowledge. For not only is human "being" the content projected, but the objectification itself is an aid to self-understanding, for it allows us to observe our own desired perfections. For Feuerbach theology is anthropology because it articulates the idea of the human; religion is thus a sort of necessary detour to self-knowledge. Stevens makes a similar claim when he argues, in his essay "Two or Three Ideas," that "the gods are the definition of perfection in ideal creatures," (847). In a poem of mid-career, he puts it less flatteringly: "Theology after 744 The Problem of a Secular Poetics</page><page sequence="5">breakfast sticks to the eye" (222). In other words, theology is bound up with empirical want and satisfaction, as when we eat, and we real- ize that any attempted projection always "sticks" to us. In this model, secularization does not necessitate the expulsion of religious content, only its rearticulation outside mythic categories. Hans Blumenberg refers to this as the "extraction of the anthropological core" from theology, a reclamation of the human from the more than human.12 The last strategy, elimination, challenges the assumptions of both the adaptive and substitutionary models. Elimination does not look for substitute satisfactions, but uproots the very needs, desires, and moral assumptions that were a part of the religious framework. As Nietzsche wrote in Human, All Too Human, But in the end one also has to understand that the needs which religion has satisfied . . . are not immutable; they can be weakened and exterminated. Consider, for example, that Christian distress of mind that comes from sighing over one s inner depravity and care for one s salvation - all conceptions originating in nothing but errors of reason and deserving, not satisfaction, but obliteration.13 Our needs and desires did not just create a religious order; rather, the religious order also helped constitute those needs and desires. Elimination, then, would not just discard the idea of God, but would also discard all of the ancillary ideas and dispositions that accompanied that idea: nature, man, the self, grammar. Michel Foucault and Jean- Luc Nancy have been two of the most influential recent proponents of this basically Nietzschean position, as when Foucault claims that modern psychoanalysis merely reproduces pernicious Christian themes of inwardness and confession, or when Nancy suspects that our very sense of our modernity is beholden to a monotheistic understanding of the world as a project.14 Stevens never definitively chose among the three paradigms, but he experimented with them throughout his career, exploring their difficul- ties and limitations. Indeed, his poem "Lions in Sweden" (1934) - a light, almost comic poem on a serious theme - dramatizes the paradoxes involved in deciding for or against any of them. The central claim of the poem is that one cannot simply discard the idea of the soul without discarding the whole economy of which the soul was a part: No more phrases, Swenson: I was once A hunter of those sovereigns of the soul And savings banks, Fides, the sculptors prize, Matthew Mutter 745</page><page sequence="6">All eyes and size, and galled Justitia, Trained to poise the tables of the law, Patientia forever soothing wounds And mighty Fortitudo, frantic bass. But these shall not adorn my souvenirs, These lions, these majestic images. If the fault is with the soul, the sovereigns Of the soul must likewise be at fault, and first. If the fault is with the souvenirs, yet these Are the soul itself. And the whole of the soul, Swenson, As every man in Sweden will concede, Still hankers after lions, or, to shift, Still hankers after sovereign images. If the fault is with the lions, send them back To Monsieur Dufy s Hamburg whence they came. The vegetation still abounds with forms. (102) The economic metaphors of the poem are devices for examining religious and secular economies. Sovereigns here are both coins and "sovereign images," the latter denoting the regulating religious ideals (like Faith, Justice, Patience and Fortitude) that composed our moral imaginations. The sovereign as currency, or token of exchange-value, raises the question of whether these virtues are, quite literally, fun- gible. Can they be translated from a religious to a secular idiom, just as currency is exchanged? The sovereign as a governing image, however, suggests that the virtues depend on an imaginative world-picture that orients our lives. They can't simply be transplanted into a different world-picture. The religious gold that backs the moral and existential currency (the doctrinal framework) and the banks that housed them (the churches) are dwindling, and Stevens wonders what becomes of the currency when that which insures it dissipates. The speaker tells the metaphysical banker that he no longer hunts sovereigns of the soul. But why, then, does the soul still "hanker" after sovereign images when we have rejected them? It could be that humans have an inexorable need for sovereign images as such, or it could be because the soul as soul is constituted by these sovereign images; it does not exist apart from them, and as long as we still har- bor the needs and desires proper to the souls particular logic, we will desire sovereign images. Yet when we try to locate which parts of the self, which desires, are responsible for our metaphysical distortions and thus need uprooting, they are difficult to isolate. Fault cannot 746 The Problem of a Secular Poetics</page><page sequence="7">be ascribed to one particular agent, because it permeates the whole religious economy: If the fault is with the soul, the sovereigns Of the soul must likewise be at fault, and first. If the fault is with the souvenirs, yet these Are the soul itself. (102) Again, it is nearly impossible to isolate the needs and desires of the soul from the souls sovereign images, for those images helped constitute the needs and desires in the first place. Is the fault in the soul? In its sovereign images? In the souvenirs, the identity-forming memories that will no longer be adorned by the religious logic of faith, justice, patience, and fortitude? These memories have habituated us to reli- gious accounts of the world, and religious expectations regarding the meanings of our lives. But if the soul is these memories, how can one evade it? Substitution doesn't seem to work here, because every term in the religious economy of self is implicated in all the others; you can't change one without changing them all. It would seem that a secular economy of self requires the elimination of the religious one altogether. No translation, or exchange, is possible. Yet the speaker insists that the "whole of the soul" still "hankers" after "sovereign im- ages," and makes no apology for this. He apparently wants to satisfy, rather than eliminate, this hankering. None of Stevens s paradigms can be unconditionally adopted, but neither can they be dismissed. There are many areas of human concern affected by the problems raised in "Lions of Sweden," but one of the most urgent for Stevens involves the ways in which poets (and humans in general) employ the figures and tropes of language, and what those figures suggest about how one understands the ends of life. When thinking about what words are and do, Stevens is almost always working against paradigms that he considers religious.15 There is a constant suspicion in Stevens s poetry that language cannot rid itself of a kind of theological suggestiveness, and that there is something religious about certain figures of language native to poetry: analogy, metaphor, signs and symbols. Stevens is mistrustful of the way metaphor slides into metaphysics, the way an analogical worldview has been associated with a theological one, and the ways in which signs and symbols tend to refer solid, immanent things to supersensible narratives or meanings. At the same time, Stevens suggests, the elimination of poetry's theological indiscretions might mean the end of poetry itself. Matthew Mutter 747</page><page sequence="8">One of the central poetic strategies Stevens employs to circum- vent this problem is the use of tautology, a mode of encountering and describing the world that operates as a resistance to the habits of transcendence and dualism Stevens associates with religion. Tau- tology is connected, moreover, to an approach to perception that is entirely sensory, and within which human desire is satisfied with the immediately available - with the worldly, the physical, the immanent. In particular, the antidote to religious ideation is often taken to involve a reliance on visual or spatial perception that opposes itself to the her- meneutical activities that aim at finding meaning. The world does not have a sense, but is sense. "The consolations of space," Stevens says, "are nameless things" (482). 16 Stevenss feeling about these matters is formed against the intellectual backdrop of the Symbolist movement, which had a mystical agenda; early anthropology of religion, which had a good deal to say about the religious functions of symbolic and associative (analogical and metonymical) thinking; and Romantic and twentieth-century philosophy17 Stevens s early poetry has often been associated with French Sym- bolism, and while that influence is not insignificant, Stevens came to dissent from its ontological premises, which are fundamentally religious.18 As Arthur Symons wrote, It is all an attempt to spiritualise literature, to evade the old bondage of rhetoric, the old bondage of exteriority. . . . Here then, in this revolt against exteriority, against rhetoric, against a materialistic tradition; in this endeavour to disengage the ultimate essence, the soul, of whatever exists and can be realised by the consciousness; in this dutiful waiting upon every symbol by which the soul of things can be made visible; literature, bowed down by so many burdens, may at last attain liberty, and its authentic speech. In attaining this liberty, it accepts a heavier burden; for in speaking to us so intimately, so solemnly, as only a religion had hitherto spoken to us, it comes itself a kind of religion, which all the duties and responsibilities of the sacred ritual.19 What Stevens rejects is precisely this substitutionary logic, in the sense I have been using the term. He does not revolt against exteriority but celebrates it; he writes, in his commonplace book, of the inhuman otherness and opacity of the world outside the self as his "ultimate inamorata."20 For Symons, the symbol is the invisible made visible, but Stevens desired to "make the visible a little hard to see" (275). The Symbolist also presupposes a possible world of correspondences between spiritual interior and material exterior. Baudelaire s famous "Correspondences," often considered the first Symbolist poem, makes 748 The Problem of a Secular Poetics</page><page sequence="9">just this claim. Stevens, in contrast, often spoke of the relation be- tween external and internal as antagonistic: "There is a war between the mind / And sky," he writes (351). The mind is, he says, "a violence from within that protects us from a violence without" (665). His is not a world of correspondences between spiritual significance and physical fact, or transcendent and immanent experience. The Symbolists assumed that the immanent world was not adequate to the spiritual aspirations concealed in the aspirations of language. Stevenss ambition to make language tautological with the experi- ence of the world in its immanence is an ambition to overturn this prejudice against the world, to experience it as something "complete," "sufficient," "adequate," or "enough." These sorts of words appear in Stevens s poetry again and again. To experience the world as sufficient, even as a plenitude, is to repudiate the intuition he, following William James, thought the beginning of religious consciousness; namely, that there is something wrong with the world, and that our difficulty here means we must refer our discontented desire to something "beyond" in order to render it intelligible and relieve our misery.21 Stevens, therefore, often adopts what the German philosopher Odo Marquard has called a "dietetics of meaning," a discipline through which one takes "a step into profane existence" by eliminating cer- tain religious needs and expectations. According to Marquard, "The experience of meaning deficits does not always have to be due to lack of meaning; it can also result from excessive expectations of meaning. In that case it is not that meaning is lacking, but that the demand for meaning is immoderate."22 Stevens looks to the sensory because it ends with itself, is satisfied with itself, asks nothing beyond itself. It makes no sense to say of a color, a shape, or a landscape, "Is it enough?" The visual imperative in Stevens can therefore be understood as an attempt to overcome the uneasiness toward the visual in monotheis- tic religions, with their proscriptions of idolatry and their preference for the interior or the inward. Stevens follows Nietzsche s project of collapsing religious binaries like those between surface and depth, appearance and truth, and their moral correlatives, like those between intention and performance.23 "On the Road Home" is a poem that promotes this elevation of the visual against dimensions relating to meaning or understanding. The poem is structured as a dialogue between two anonymous speakers. The claim that forms the concern of the poem is, "The world must be measured by eye" (186). That declaration, moreover, follows syl- logistically from a previous negation: "Words are not forms of a single Matthew Mutter 749</page><page sequence="10">word" (186). There is not, then, a supernatural or transcendent ground of language, no world pregnant with a Word of God that unifies dis- parate speech and makes of the world a text. The world cannot be approached hermeneutically. One cannot move from the relational indeterminacy of words to the feeling that, as the hermeneutical phi- losophers argue, there is an "indeterminate totality of meaning that is implicitly present in the spoken word."24 Stevens dissents from a religious philosophy of language as conceived by an anti-enlightenment, Christian pietist thinker like Johann Georg Hamann, who thought that in a pre-lapsarian world, Every phenomenon of nature was a word, - the sign, symbol and pledge of a new, mysterious, inexpressible but all the more intimate union, participation and community of divine energies and ideas. Everything the human being heard from the beginning, saw with its eyes, looked upon and touched with its hands was a living word; for God was the word.25 Here the seen and overflowing signification are one; in Stevens they are at odds. The Symbolists had tried to preserve something similar, even if more private and heterodox, in their theories of correspon- dence and their accounts of the world as a hieroglyph of the soul (or as raw material for transcendence). But for Stevens experience at its most authentic is spatial rather than hermeneutic: the world must be measured by eye.26 Sight is tautological: it discloses the intensity of the unmediated, non-linguistically-altered being of the world. This is why, in "EsthÃ©tique du Mal," Stevens wants a tautologous state - "to see what one sees" - to be experienced not a "poverty," or as a "los[s]" of "sensibility," but "[a]s if sight had ... its own miraculous thrift" (282). The possibilities for sight in "On the Road Home" emerge as the other partner in the dialogue broaches the problem of idolatry and truth, the correlatives of vision and word: It was when you said, "The idols have seen lots of poverty, Snakes and gold and lice, But not the truth"; It was at that time, that the silence was largest And longest, the night was roundest, The fragrance of autumn warmest, Closest and strongest. (186) 750 The Problem of a Secular Poetics</page><page sequence="11">Stevens is playing here with the idea of idolatry, which is an attempt to make divine truth visible. The speaker seems to be accepting, but is actually inverting, the monotheistic critique of idolatry: if the idols have never "seen" the truth, this is not because truth is a transcendent unity inaccessible to the senses. It is because "the truth," which would gather up the details of the visible world and convert them into a single meaning, is not something to which sight aspires. For Stevens, the monotheistic duality enforced between idolatry (the visible) and truth (the spoken and understood) has devalued the world of sight, made of it something sordid. As the poem closes, the reestablishment of sight outside the boundaries of religious truth has produced a robust spatial world (it is "round" and "close") that yields sensory pleasure (it is "warm" and "strong") in an absence of language (a large, long "silence"). Sensory secularization has been accomplished. A problem Stevens leaves the reader with, however, and of which he is certainly aware, is that this has been accomplished by the internalization of de- clarative, truth-asserting propositions. The whole poem takes the form of a dialogue that would not be out of place in Plato or the Gospels, and its movement depends upon the back and forth of "It was when I said ... It was when you said." It is a discussion that seems to aim at what is being denied - "the truth." What is more, the outcome of the discussion - a silent sensory bliss - has been generated precisely by the activity of truthful speech. The world has been "measured" by words as much as by "eye." The ontology of "On the Road Home," like the ontology of much of the collection in which it is found, Parts of a World, is characterized by incommensurability and plurality. The different parts of the world do not form a whole. This conviction, however, creates a problem for Stevens, for poetry seems bound to analogy, the discovery of similitude in dissimilitude. Percy Bysshe Shelley's "Defense of Poetry" - a text Stevens cared for - implies that the heart of poetry is analogy; poets mark "the before unapprehended relations of things."27 Poetic language illuminates the participation of one thing in another. Because our understanding of an object constantly increases with the proliferation of the analogies by which we encounter it, an object is never simply itself, never self-identical. It exists always in relation to other objects. As Paul Ricoeur has written, "analogical predication" is grounded in "an ontology of participation," in which all things "have partially what another possesses or is fully."28 Because of this ontology of participa- tion, analogy has tended to become theological when turned into a worldview: finite entities participate in each other, and together they Matthew Mutter 751</page><page sequence="12">participate in the infinite unity complete in its having and being: God. The intimation of analogy seems to be "tremulous with the intimation of a world-order," with "the weight of cosmological significance."29 Whatever one thinks of such an intimation, it is, as Kenneth Burke puts it, in the nature of words that they "may be used analogically, to designate a further dimension, the 'supernatural/ Whether or not there is a realm of the supernatural, there are words for it." This is why, for Stevens, words have a tendency toward metaphysical irresponsibil- ity. But this is the case, Burke asserts, because language can already be thought of as a mode of "transcendence." "There is a sense," he writes, "in which language is not just 'natural/ but really does add a 'new dimension' to the things of nature (an observation that would be the logological equivalent of the theological statement that grace perfects nature)."30 Because language adds this new dimension to the things of nature, it makes possible a proliferation of new desires that have a vexed rela- tion to the biological order. So, writes Burke, [L]anguages make it impossible for men to be content with sheer bodily purpose. And insofar as men 'cannot live by bread alone' they are moved by doctrine, which is to say, they derive purposes from language, which tells them what they 'ought' to want to do, tells them how to do it, and in the telling goads them with great threats and promises, even unto the gates of heaven and hell. . . . With language, a whole new realm of purpose arises, endless in scope, as contrasted with the few rudimentary purposes we derive from our bodies, the needs of food, drink, shelter, and sex in their physical simplicity.31 This is precisely the quality of language that makes Stevens uncomfort- able: language has the capacity to create desires and purposes that do not, in a strictly naturalistic sense, have clear or easily-achieved ends. It gestures toward a transcendent order of satisfaction, but seems unable to deliver this order. And this difficulty is why, in a poem like "Credences of Summer," the imperative to "exile desire / For what is not" (323, emphasis added) can only be accomplished in a world that ceases to be a regarded as a text or sign of anything. In this poem, if one can employ a language at all it is the "Pure rhetoric of a language without words" (324). There is no analogical order; the "old man" of the poem "reads no book" (323). The speaker calls the world a "rock," "but it is not / A hermits truth nor symbol in hermitage" (324). Nei- ther the world nor the objects in the world are symbols of anything, 752 The Problem of a Secular Poetics</page><page sequence="13">because symbols generate the possibility of a transcendence that must be refused. Because of these associations, Stevens strives to secularize analogy or to eliminate it altogether in tautology. In the late poem "An Ordi- nary Evening in New Haven," analogy is associated with what Stevens calls the "instinct for heaven." By that point in his career, he no longer thinks such an instinct can be expunged, but he nonetheless prefers its secular "counterpart," the "instinct for earth," characterized as "The gay tournamonde as of a single world / In which he is and as and is are one" (406). This secular world is single, univocal - a world in which the comparative "as" collapses into the self-identical "is." The same problem arises in the earlier "Connoisseur of Chaos": After all the pretty contrast of life and death Proves that these opposite things partake of one, At least that was the theory, when bishops' books Resolved the world. We cannot go back to that. The squirming facts exceed the squamous mind, If one may say so. And yet relation appears, A small relation expanding like a shade Of a cloud on sand, a shape on the side of a hill. (195) That two things can "partake of one," that disunity is not absolute, but grounded in unity, that all things can be understood in "relation" to one another, analogously - these, according to Stevens, were the postulates of "bishops' books." There was behind the chaos of phenomena, if not an actual intelligibility, at least a presumption of intelligibility. Such intelligibility occurred by virtue of the participation of the world (of "creation") in God. Stevens insists "we cannot go back to that." Our world must be secular. But he follows this inflexible declaration with an "and yet." "And yet relation appears": relation, the property that seems to render the world intelligible. One of Stevens s consistent refrains is that mind is not at home in the world. Yet the appearance of relation, the discovery of kinship and affinity, seems to suggest that the mind is not simply at the margins of the world, that knowing and being are not helplessly estranged.32 At the same time, Stevens marks the difficulty of affirming post-religious "relation" precisely by embed- ding the tentative affirmation of relation in a relation - a simile - that is hard for the mind to assimilate. For a "relation," which is something abstract and invisible, is here rendered material and spatial, and thus unthinkable. How is a relation like an expanding "shape" or "shade," Matthew Mutter 753</page><page sequence="14">when strictly speaking it only exists between or among shapes and shades? The poem itself dramatizes the difficulty of dwelling in the merely visible. Stevens claims in "Connoisseur" that "an old order is a violent one" - it does not do justice to the variety and complexity of "facts." He cannot, however, say this without adding yet another qualifying conjunction: "But suppose the disorder of truths should ever come / To an order, most Plantagenet, most fixed . . ." (195). Stevens s ap- peal to the Plantagenet (the dynasty that ruled England and parts of France) returns us explicitly to that medieval (analogical, hierarchical, fixed) theological world, and yet the ellipses make the line trail off as if in ambivalent nostalgia. The poem closes with an aphorism. "The pensive man," it tells us, is able to perceive the "eagle float / For which the intricate Alps are a single nest" (195). In the earlier "Comedian as the Letter C," the musician-poet has to be "Oblivious to the Aztec almanacs" - texts that document the occult relation between spiritual forces and physical phenomena - in order to "make the intricate Si- erras scan" (31). To make mountains scan might be to suppose that the world is infused with a kind of poetic logos that one can read, but in both passages relation no longer exists in the world, only in the pensive mans poem. Because he suspects that his recalcitrant desire for analogical order is corrupted by this sort of nostalgia, Stevens s secularizing strategy often turns to the rejection of relation altogether in tautology, a rhetorical formula in which A= A. Tautology is more than a refusal of analogy. It is also a refusal of signs and symbols. The last canto of "The Man With the Blue Guitar," for instance, concludes with the tautological hope that "The bread / Will be our bread," not the bread of the Christian eucharist (151). In the poem "Evening Without Angels," "Air is air, / Its vacancy glitters around us everywhere." Once again, however, there is a paradox that in the rejection of symbolism symbols are slyly reproduced; air is air, but this "vacancy" is a symbol of negation, a refusal of any religious anthropomorphism, as when, in the past, "sad men made angels of the sun, and of/ The moon they made their own attendant ghosts" (137).33 Stevens also uses his tautologies to renounce the religious insistence that special states of consciousness must be developed in order to ensure the proper experience of the world. So in a passage in "Descrip- tion Without Place" that prunes the Gospel of John ("The thesis of the plentifullest John"), Stevens speaks of "A text we should be born that we might read" (301). The self does not need to be born again, as in 754 The Problem of a Secular Poetics</page><page sequence="15">the New Testament gospel, but only "born"; the imperative "should be," which normally indicates a state of possibility transcending what merely exists, is deliberately undermined, for being "born" is not something to which an already existing person could aspire. Anyone who would "read", it is safe to say, has by definition achieved the state of being born. Similarly, Stevens s tautologies reduce the objects or experiences under consideration to that which is most basic about them: their physical givenness. The most that can be said about these things is that they "are," or, in a temporal register, that they "occur." Stevens returns to the language of "occurrence" again and again in a poem like "The Sense of the Sleight of Hand Man.": One's grand flights, one s Sunday baths, One s tootings at the weddings of the soul Occur as they occur. So bluish clouds Occurred above the empty house and the leaves Of the rhododendrons rattled their gold. (205) The poem thus reduces these ostensibly religious (or romantic) mo- ments in the life of the "soul" to almost mechanical events. To say that they "occur as they occur" gives the reader no new information. One cannot say anything about them other than that they have come to pass. One cannot read them: they are beyond interpretation because they are not situated in a web of significance, metaphysical or other. The meaning of their "occurrence" cannot be distinguished from the appearance of natural phenomena such as clouds or leaves. The poem continues: Could you have said the bluejay suddenly Would swoop to earth? It is a wheel, the rays Around the sun. The wheel survives the myths. The fire eye in the clouds survives the gods. To think of a dove with an eye of grenadine And pines that are cornets, so it occurs. (205) What survives the myths and the gods - which for Stevens are obsolete cultural modes of explaining phenomena - is simply the endurance of the world in all its "sudden," inexplicable motion.34 Even associative, poetic thought - thought that brings images from disparate areas of life into relation, the very work of thought that constitutes this poem - is subsumed into an "it" that merely happens. Matthew Mutter 755</page><page sequence="16">The poem cannot so reduce itself, however. This truth is acknowl- edged in the title's suggestion that the achievement of a "sense" before the obsolete modifications of religious language requires a "sleight- of-hand" (205). The poets search for a mechanistic image that resists religious interpretation is still an image, and so provides a value-laden picture of the world. The vital energies that animate the world are a "wheel" - they don't occur indiscriminately, but as a cycle. Even as the speaker wants to find images to capture bare "occurrence," he finally returns to the language of religion (perhaps to the Vedas, where the wheel of time image may have arisen, or to pagan religious cultures that held cyclical conceptions of time). The speaker claims a religious image can "survive" the theology (the "myths" and "gods") in which it was originally intelligible. He attempts to convert religious images into poetic ones by insisting, as he employs them, that the truth about the worlds life cannot be expressed outside the rhetoric of tautology. But this is, precisely, a "sleight-of-hand." The secularization of religious language seems to require a kind of magical manipulation, in which our perception of the origin and significance of a word or image has been obscured. The "ignorant mans" work of "sense" - his immediate experience of the world - is really a work of magic (205). Moreover, the tautologous desire the speaker leaves us with - "to mate his life with life" - is complicated in the realization that a tautological state is by definition something that cannot be achieved (205). A desire by its very nature requires an awareness of a gap between what one is (an incomplete, individual human "life") and what one would like to be ("life" as such). The desire is, finally, to participate in "life" rather than to be identical with "life," or else life could not, strictly speaking, be desired. And participation, as I have argued, is analogical rather than tautological. Stevens continues the debate within himself as to the desirability of analogical thinking and experience in "On the Adequacy of Landscape" and "Les Plus Belles Pages," poems I believe are deliberately paired together in Parts of a World. The pairing of the two poems helps us to further understand the problems of analogical or metaphorical rela- tion as, in Stevens s mind, religious problems. "Adequacy" is a pagan poem engaged in Stevens s ongoing project of declaring, as the title itself suggests, the adequacy of the world as a realm of experience that requires no justification or meaning beyond its own sheer existence. Stevens s familiar interest in what is "adequate," "enough," or "suffi- cient" is in the largest perspective an exertion of rhetorical pressure to forget the desire to "justify" the world as a whole, because justification 756 The Problem of a Secular Poetics</page><page sequence="17">is at bottom a religious project of theodicy. In more local perspective the language of adequacy pressures the self to encounter individual objects without requiring that they bear any significance deriving from their placement in a symbolic matrix. The poem gives us a vision of "being" as this sort of sheer existence. People, the poem suggests, tend to avoid the "hap-hallow hallow-ho / Of central things," things that are characterized merely "by being there." These people are "insensible" to the "blood-red redness of the sun," shrinking instead to an "oblivion / Beyond the keenest diamond day." The diamond day, however, in which people are at the center because they are "sensible to pain," is a world in which cocks wake animated by a desire "merely to be again." The people open to sensory experience "turn toward" the strength of the day and trees and light, "as if these / Were what they are" (221-222). In other words, to achieve this heightened yet ordinary state we must experience the objects of our environment (landscape) as self-identical, as being exactly and nothing but themselves. They become tautolo- gous: they cannot be described, and so displaced, metaphorically or symbolically or allegorically. "The extent of what they are" can only be felt within a "sensible range." Something very similar happens in "The Latest Freed Man," for whom "the morning is color and mist, which is enough" (204). The visible "overtakes] the doctrine of this landscape." Everything is more real in simply "seeing it." Yet the following poem, "Les Plus Belles Pages," expresses uncer- tainty that things can be merely "what they are." Whereas the day in "Adequacy" is nothing but what it is, in this poem "the moonlight / Was less than moonlight. Nothing exists by itself." The moonlight cannot be experienced outside of its relations; it is not absolutely singular. The presence of the milkman who "came in the moonlight" suggests that the identity of either only emerges in the analogical interval between them. That this is associated in Stevens s mind with theological prob- lems becomes evident in the surprising arrival of Aquinas in the poem: He spoke, Kept speaking of God. I changed the word to man. The automaton, in logic self-contained, Existed by itself. Or did the saint survive? Did several spirits assume a single shape? Theology after breakfast sticks to the eye. (245) These lines are obscure. In a note on the poem, Stevens wrote, "What it really means is that the interrelation between things is what makes Matthew Mutter 757</page><page sequence="18">them fecund" (867). The organicist appeal to fecundity affirms analogy without permitting a transcendent register. In the same note Stevens calls Aquinas a "chance example," but this seems unlikely, and he con- cludes his commentary on the poem without mentioning his discussion of the automaton and his replacement of the word God with man. Though Aquinas was a famous proponent of "the analogy of being," Stevens seems to think of the doctrine of Gods self-subsistence ("in logic self-contained") as a tyrannically monistic conception of being.35 And we see how Stevens is uncertain as to the meaning of the secu- lar translation (changing the word) from God to man. If God was an automaton, do we transfer that conception to humans, or do we see the human as dependent on the material energies that constitute it? Does the saints feeling of "absolute dependence" - which Friedrich Schleiermacher considered most basic of religious attitudes - "survive" in the feeling of analogical relatedness?36 And can we affirm, there- fore, a unity-in-plurality ("several spirits" assuming "a single shape") so that, as in the theological idea of analogy, the difference of beings does not either undergo violence or have that difference effaced in relation to a transcendent unity? All that we can say for sure is that "theology after breakfast sticks to the eye," that our speech about God is speech about humans, and therefore the secular fate of theological claims have consequences for our claims about ourselves. If, for Stevens, analogy threatened to slip into a specious sense of world-order, metaphor seemed dangerously close to metaphysics. There is one strand of modernist thought, following Emerson and Nietzsche, which took metaphor, if acknowledged as such, to be an antidote to a theological or metaphysical worldview. If taken as provisional and fluid, metaphor could operate as a mode of representation that evaded the absolutist truth-claims of such a worldview. After a recognition that truth itself was, as Nietzsche wrote, merely a "mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms," metaphor could be reclaimed as a tool of thinking proper to the immanence and tempo- rality of existence.37 Stevens describes this feeling in famous poems like "The Motive for Metaphor," in which, instead of being what you are, you seek a place "Where you yourself were never quite yourself, / And did not want or have to be" (257). The "motive for metaphor" is a "shrinking from the weight of primary noon," the very gesture of avoidance that was derided in "On the Adequacy of Landscape" as the practice of a people who are "frightened" of the "sharpest sun" and the "keenest diamond day." Metaphor seen in this light construes 758 The Problem of a Secular Poetics</page><page sequence="19">the divisions that language produces between a creature and its self- expression as a kind of freedom. Yet Stevens also harbors a different perspective on metaphor, ani- mated by an anxiety that metaphor still bears the residue of a theological conception that devalues the world as world.38 One finds this suspicion in Martin Heidegger, a thinker Stevens admired from afar. Heidegger argued, "The metaphorical exists only within metaphysics."39 As Paul Ricoeur has commented, This saying suggests that the trans-gression of meta-phor and that of meta-physics are but one and the same transfer. Several things are implied here: first, that the ontology implicit in the entire rhetorical tradition is that of Western 'metaphysics' of the Platonic or neo-Platonic type, where the soul is transported from the visible world to the invisible world; second, that meta-phorical means transfer from the proper sense to the figurative sense; finally, that both transfers constitute one and the same Uber-trÃ¤gung.40 In this account, metaphor is transferred sense. This is problematic for Stevens because "sense" is the term he uses most often to denote the register of experience that is most in touch with the world. Sense is immediate, and Stevens tends to identify the immediate with the authentic. The problem with the signifying function of language, or with re-presentation as such, is that the ostensibly primitive, immedi- ate relation between word and object is now mediate. In "Bouquet of Roses in Sunlight," Stevens comes upon flowers that are "Too much as they are to be changed by metaphor." The poem continues, "Our sense of these things changes and they change / Not as in metaphor, but in our sense / Of them. So sense exceeds all metaphor" (431). Accordingly, one sometimes finds in Stevens a longing for an animal- istic "language" that would be a pure expression of instinctual energies and their relation to their environment. His early poem "Anecdote of Men By the Thousand," begins with a secular revision: "The soul, he said, is composed / Of the external world." The articulation of such a "soul" would have a bodily immediacy resistant to the spiritualizations of language: "There are men whose words / Are as natural sounds / Of their places / As the cackle of Toucans / In the place of toucans" (51). In the later "Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction," Stevens is less convinced that human speech can operate like a toucan s cackle. There, while the "lion roars at the enraging desert," the "elephant breaches the darkness of Ceylon with blares," and the "bear . . . snarls in his mountain," the human ephebe, who has only a "rented piano," lies in Matthew Mutter 759</page><page sequence="20">"silence": "You writhe and press / A bitter utterance from your writh- ing, dumb, / Yet voluble dumb violence" (332). The noise of animals is continuous with their life of sense. But our music is "rented" - it does not belong to us. Our language is somehow at odds with our nature. There is an antagonism between language and the life of sense that we share with animals. The "speech" of animals is triumphant, an act of self-assertion, an audible manifestation of what they are. For humans, however, language is evidence of an unknown or incomplete nature. It is a confused violence, and, at the end of the day, a poor substitute for sense. In "The Pure Good of Theory," Stevens discusses what might be called a fall into metaphor. The poem is evidence of Stevens s interest in formulating a genealogy of religious belief. Its argument is something of an amalgam of Keats s celebrated comparison of the imagination to Adam s dream ("he awoke and found it truth") and Nietzsche's more deconstructive account of the way metaphor ossified into metaphysical belief.41 As with so many other aspects of Stevens s thinking, his "solu- tions" to the problems of metaphor and belief are dialectical. On the one hand, there is Stevens s well-known conviction that post-religious belief must be a sort of avowed illusion, fully aware of its metaphoricity and provisionality. (Stevens calls this "the nicer knowledge of/ Belief, that what it believes in is not true" [291].) On the other - which I think is less critically understood - there is the conviction that metaphor is an illegitimate abstraction from sensory experience:42 We knew one parent must have been divine, Adam of beau regard, from fat Elysia, Whose mind malformed this morning metaphor, While all the leaves leaked gold. His mind made morning, As he slept. He woke in a metaphor: this was A metamorphosis of paradise, Malformed, this world was paradise malformed . . . (291) These lines owe something to the early anthropological speculation that religion was born of an attempt to understand the dream-world as another real world that made equal claims upon the self. The genetic account seems to go like this: The experience of diurnal waking is such that it is associated with birth. The relation between waking from sleep at the sun s daily "birth" and actual, physical birth is then confused 760 The Problem of a Secular Poetics</page><page sequence="21">(the antecedent lines read, "Man, that is not born of woman but of air, / That comes here in the solar chariot"). Meanwhile, the pleasure of the freshness of morning ("the leaves leaked gold"), which is now felt to be a kind of re-birth, becomes confused in the imagination, and the idea of an original state of morning - paradise - develops, in which our birth, as after sleep, came from the sun. Because the metaphor is more compelling, its sensory base begins to feel like a distortion of the metaphor, rather the opposite. The diurnal repetition of the sacred origin feels like a dilution of that origin, and because the world is not always felt to be a fresh morning, the morning has become a reminder of when the paradisal world was fresh. And so the world, which enabled the metaphor of paradise, becomes "paradise malformed." The metaphorical translation becomes, almost irresistibly, the root of religious dualisms and the theological concept of the fall. The impasse of the poem is exemplary of the larger problems Stevens faces when trying to secularize poetry, problems which have been the concern of this essay. Stevens wants to discard the doctrine of the fall. As he famously writes in "The Poems of Our Climate," "the imperfect is our paradise" (179). Yet as "The Pure Good of Theory" shows, the fall is reinscribed in the very account of how we came to think of ourselves as fallen.43 Even if we did not eat the fruit, our illusory concept of the fall was produced by a very real fall into metaphor; a fall, moreover, that the poet least of anyone has evaded. The secular immediacy Stevens seeks - the sense of being at home in the world - is thwarted by the very poetry through which he strives to obtain it. Indeed, there comes a point in Stevens s career in which he begins to conclude that language, and so the poetic imagination as such, is an intractably religious element in which certain kinds of desires are created that are not simply immanent. It is impossible to pinpoint when this transition took place. I do not want to suggest that the new perspective is absolute, or that it does not continue to be assaulted by the desire for a language of immanence. Yet after a long ambivalence towards the work of analogy, one finds in Stevens s essay "The Effects of Analogy" (1948) a celebration of it precisely as an agent of transcen- dence. Though the essay opens by implying the obsolescence of the "supreme example of analogy" in English, it closes by commending the man who lives a life of "transcendence" - a surprising value to find in Stevens, the poet of "the cry of leaves that do not transcend themselves" (460) - expressly by dwelling in an analogy: Matthew Mutter 761</page><page sequence="22">Take the case of a man for whom reality is enough, as, at the end of his life, he returns to it like a man returning from Nowhere to his village and to everything there that is tangible and visible, which he has come to cherish and wants to be near. He sees without images. But is he not seeing a clarified reality of his own? Does he not dwell in an analogy? His imageless world is, after all, of the same sort as a world full of the obvious analogies of happiness or unhappiness, innocence or tragedy, thoughtlessness or heaviness of the mind. In any case, these are the pictorializations of men, for whom the world exists as a world and for whom life exists as life, the objects of their passions, the objects before which they come and speak, with intense choosing, words that we remember and make our own. Their words have made a world that transcends the world and a life livable in that transcendence. It is transcendence achieved by means of the minor effects of figurations and the major effects of the poet s sense of the world. . . . Poetry becomes and is a transcendent analogue. (722-23) This is a remarkable passage. On the one hand, Stevens is still fiercely holding on to the basic conception of the world as immanent: this is still a man for whom "reality is enough," dedicated to the "tangible" and the "visible." On the other hand, this very at-home-ness in the world, this intimacy with its objects, is not a contact with the world in its sheer material, pre-linguistic splendor. Rather, the sense of im- manence is constructed within a life of transcendence made possible by the language of analogy. It is a fiction of tautology lived within an analogy that has become so completely internalized that it no longer seems to bear any religious dualism. This is a man "for whom the world exists as a world and for whom life exists as life": the tautologous description implies that the desire for more is still being disciplined. The world and life are not instinct with hidden meanings and symbolic correspondences that would point to a mode of existence fulfilled in something other than themselves. They are still ends. Yet this world is, nonetheless, "a world that transcends the world." Stevens thus comes, very late in life, to understand poetry as a kind of transcendence-in-immanence. When he writes, in "Final Soliloquy of the Interior Paramour," "We say God and the imagination are one," the "we say" is an essential part of the sentiment (444). Maybe, Stevens suggests, it is precisely in what we say, in the linguistic response to and transformation of being, that the religious dimension unfolds. The "we say" is both hesitant - the proposition that follows is not an incontro- vertible fact, but something proposed - and also a suggestion that the aspirations of language may point towards a transcendent source that only seems implausible. As the Back-Ache says to St. John in Stevens s 762 The Problem of a Secular Poetics</page><page sequence="23">poem: "It may be, may be. It is possible" (376). But the Back- Ache, knowing only the secular world of tangible pain, is skeptical.

Philosophers and anthropologists have, in recent years, begun to examine Western secularism as a distinct imaginary with its own genealogy and moral logic, instead of understanding it as the necessary, self-evident element in which post-religious Westerners live. Two of the best of these studies - one from a philosophical, the other from an anthropologi- cal perspective - are Charles Taylor, A Secular Age (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 2007); and Talal Asad, Formations of the Secular (Stanford: Stanford Univ. Press, 2003). Stevens s poem "The Plain Sense of Things," is, I would argue, already self-conscious about the nature of secular perception. For "the plain sense" of things - the secular presumption that its world is self-evident - itself "[h]ad to be imagined as an inevitable knowledge, / Required, as a necessity requires" (428). The plain sense is never actually plain, but a mode of perception that exists within an imaginary. 3 Helen Vendler, Wallace Stevens: Words Chosen Out of Desire (Knoxville: Univ. of Tennessee Press, 1984), 29. 4Jahan Ramazani, Poetry of Mourning: The Modern Elegy From Hardy to Heaney (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1994), 131. Eleanor Cook assumes something similar when explaining how Stevens appropriated the French thinker Simone Weil's theological concept of "decreation." Cook argues that Stevens "adapts Weils religious term to secular use," but does not explain how this adaptation works, or whether it is intelligible (Poetry, Word-Play, and Word-War in Wallace Stevens [Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1988], 218). For Weil, the term "decreation" signifies, among other things, a process God underwent in order to make room for creation, and we are to imitate God in passing from the created to the uncreated, renouncing our individual being in order to love God and so be annihilated in the plenitude of his being. (See Weil, Gravity and Grace, trans. Arthur Wills [Lincoln: Univ. of Nebraska Press], 78-86). For Stevens, it means nearly the opposite. It denotes the breakdown of the metaphysical presuppositions that sustained Western culture, to the extent that we no longer see them as something given and objective, but as products of our own imaginations: "Modern reality is a reality of decreation, in which our revelations are not the revelations of belief, but the precious portents of our own powers" (750). In Weil, decreation anni- hilates the "I" before the Absolute; in Stevens, decreation swells the "I" by absorbing the Absolute into itself. Can we say that this is a legitimate, intelligible adaptation? 5 Robert Render, Stevens, Williams, Crane, and the Motive For Metaphor (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005), xxiv. Matthew Mutter 763</page><page sequence="24">6 Vincent PÃ©coras recent book, Secularization and Cultural Criticism (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 2006), has revisited this oft-forgotten problematic. Pecora provides a good account of the intellectual history of the idea of secularization, and in particular of how Western secular culture has understood its relation to its Christian past. 7 Because a reader may object that by "religion" I simply mean "Christianity," or that in using the term "secular" I am mistaking a culture and ideology specific to the West and its Christian history for something normative, I want to say something about my use of these words. There are a number of scholars, who, over the last ten or twenty years, have criticized the term "religion" and the concept of "comparative" religion as problematic categories, due to forces that influenced their construction, including colonialism, scientism, dubious philosophical universalism, and the conscious or unconscious use of Christian theology (in particular the importance early modern Christianity gave to belief as the paradigmatic religious affect) as the model for un- derstanding all other religious formations. The work of Talal Asad, Tomoko Masuzawa, Jonathan Z. Smith, Saba Mahmood, Timothy Fitzgerald, Peter Harrison, and others has contributed to this critique. In the same way, the term "secular" is now being pluralized, its genealogies investigated, and its Western formulation challenged as a necessary paradigm for cultures across the world. I am largely sympathetic with these developments and challenges, though I have concerns (which I cannot discuss here) about the philosophical presuppositions and consequences of many of these arguments. Moreover, I readily acknowledge that when Wallace Stevens is thinking about "religion," what he has in mind is far more synonymous with Christianity than with, say, Islam. The problem is that he sometimes means more than Christianity and sometimes less. Religion for him can mean any or several of the following: Christianity, asceticism, Platonism, supernaturalism, theodicy, otherworldliness, mysticism, a desire to find a transcendent source of authority, an understanding of the world as a creation of some kind - even paganism, which is for Stevens an attractive ethos within the parameters of secular naturalism. What is more, it could be objected that the term "Christian" would always be in need of further refinement - Protestant? Catholic? Calvinist? Lutheran? Pentecostal? Therefore, I will often use the general term "religion" in the hope that it will be clear which aspects of religious thought or feeling I have in mind. My use of the term does not indicate that I think that there is a shared essence among all the traditions commonly called "religious" or that I think of Christianity as a template for all religions; yet it is clear that insofar as Stevens resists asceticism he would likely resist many forms of Buddhism, or in resisting transcendent sources of authority (in one poem he compares "God" to the "police") he would equally resist many forms of Islam (120). Similarly, I use "secular" as shorthand for the imaginative frame within which Stevens resists or reworks all of the perspectives he thinks of as religious. This is clearly a post-Christian frame. While Stevens certainly does not assent to all of the properties variously attributed to Western secularism (nor is he terribly interested in secularism as a political concept or arrangement), I do not know of a better word than this. Indeed, one of the arguments of this essay is that Stevens realized secularization could mean a number of things and take a number of shapes, including ones that show significant continuity with religious ideas. 8 The classic account of this transformation is Karl Lowith s book, Meaning in His- tory: The Theological Implications of the Philosophy of History (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1949). 9M.

In "The Man With the Blue Guitar," for instance, he writes, "Poetry / Exceeding music must take the place / Of empty heavens and its hymns" (137). While this sounds like an authoritative rhetoric of substitution, it does not touch on the complexities of and tensions among adaptation, substitution, and elimination of religious content that I argue Stevens dramatizes in so many of his poems. At bottom it is just an affirmation of the importance of poetry in a post-religious setting. 11 Ludwig Feuerbach, The Essence of Christianity , trans.

Press, 1987], 209). 16 Stevens s complaint is similar to Jean Luc-Nancy's more recent complaint concern- ing the monotheistic legacy of "a world whose sense is given in the mode of not being given - not yet, and, in a certain respect, never - is a world in which 'sense' itself defies all received and receivable sense" ("The Deconstruction of Monotheism," in Religion: Beyond a Concept, ed. Hent de Vries [New York: Fordham Univ. Press, 2008], 386). 17 Hans-Georg Gadamer, for instance, has written of the intractably "metaphysical background" of the "concept of the symbol": "It is possible to be led beyond the sen- sible to the divine. For the world of the senses is not mere nothingness and darkness but the outflowing and reflection of truth. The modern concept of the symbol cannot be understood apart from this gnostic function and its metaphysical background" (Truth and Method, trans. Joel Weinsheimer and Donald G. Marshall [New York: Continuum, 2000], 73). 18 See, for instance, Michael Benamou, Wallace Stevens and the Symbolist Imagination (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1972). In a very early journal entry (August 1899), Stevens adopts a Symbolist mystical attitude that would be completely anathema to his mind a couple of decades later: "I am completely satisfied that behind every physical fact there is a divine force. Don't therefore, look at facts, but through them" (L, 32). Robert BÃ¼ttel notes that in an early, unpublished poem entitled "Tides," "Stevens, in observing an underlying 'mystic sense' that relates by correspondence the tides and the secretive oceans, was tentatively drawing on the technique as well as mystique of the French Symbolists" (Wallace Stevens: The Making of Harmonium [Princeton: Princeton Univ.

Though there are affinities in their theories of imagination, the Samuel Taylor Coleridge who lamented the "despotism of the eye" and "the despotism of outward impressions" is nowhere to be found in Stevens (Coleridge, quoted in Abrams, 366). Nor is there a trace of the Wordsworth in The Prelude who, when confronting Mont Blanc in its actuality, is "grieved / To have a soulless image on the eye / Which had usurped upon a living thought" (The Thirteen Book Prelude, ed. Mark Reed, 2 vol., [Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press] 1:188). These are Christian sentiments modified in Romanticism, but the same is true of Judaism. In his book on religion and literature, Harold Bloom has noted how Judaism tends to devalue vision in favor of an interior life of meanings: "A curious sense of interiority marks Jewish thought, as a mode that negates all idolatry, all bondage to the bodily eye" (Ruin the Sacred Truths [Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1987], 149). 24 Wolfhart Pannenberg, Anthropology in Theological Perspective (New York: Con- tinuum, 1985), 394. 25 Hamann, Writings on Philosophy and Language, ed.

For an account of AugustiniÃ¡n theology's impact on Romantic theories of language that continue to frame modern debates, see Charles Taylors es- say "Language and Human Nature," in his book Human Agency and Language (New York: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1985). 26 David Jarraway, one of the few critics who have written on Stevens and religion in the last decades, seems to misunderstand Stevens s rhetoric of "the eye" and of "sight" even as he quotes "On the Road Home." Jarraway writes, "The eye, of course, is the eye of logic or reason in the Western metaphysical tradition, overlooking the safety and security of stable self-presence, the first-person T on which it plays and with which it equivocates" ("Stevens and Belief," in The Cambridge Companion to Wallace Stevens [New York: Cambridge Univ. Press, 2007], 198). Jarraway is right about the role that vision has often played in the Western metaphysical tradition, but this has nothing to do with Stevens s poetry, the highest state in which is often to "see" the world "with the hottest fire of sight" ("Credences of Summer," 322). Jarraway claims that the "eye" for Stevens is a "logocentric" image" (323) whereas in almost every poem in which this image is employed it serves as a force that undermines the authority of speech and reason. It is remarkable that Jarraway looks to "On the Road Home" as evidence of the way Stevens s poetry undermines the logocentric religious and metaphysical tradition, but does not see that "The world must be measured by eye" is precisely the line that reinforces the anti-logocentric proposition: "Words are not forms of a single word." 27 Shelleys Poetry and Prose, ed.

M. H. Abrams held that it was difficult to disentangle eighteenth-century classicist conceptions of analogy and their Romantic modifications from their origins in Renaissance theology: "[T]he divine architect has designed the universe analogically, relating the physical, moral, and spiritual realm by an elaborate system of correspon- dences" (English Romantic Poets: Modern Essays In Criticism, ed. Abrams [New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1975], 43). While the strict and inflexible hierarchies of such a universe were largely rejected by Romantic theorists, Paul de Man has claimed that half-secularized words such as "affinity" and "sympathy" continued to sustain an "analogical imagination" in which mind was not a chance, epiphenomenal accident of a prior "physical realm," but a reality that existed in ontological congruity with that realm. Such congruity presupposed a world that was theologically infused by logos (Blindness and Insight [Minneapolis: Univ. of Minnesota Press, 1983], 194-96). It is just this congruity that Stevens flatly rejects; indeed, the presupposition of incongruity is one of the most familiar tropes in his poetry. Stevens has often been considered one of the most Romantic of the modernist poets, and in many ways he is, but his rejection of an analogical universe, with all its attendant sympathies and affinities between mind and world, is a major departure from Romantic theory. Such a departure is evidence of Stevens s concern to purify Romanticism of what Abrams considered its theological residue. On Stevens as a neo- Romantic, see Joseph Carroll, Wallace Stevens s Supreme Fiction: A New Romanticism (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State Univ. Press, 1987) and George Bornstein, Transformations of Romanticism in Yeats, Eliot and Stevens (Chi- cago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1976). 33 This anti-anthropomorphic, tautologous world is one in which "desire for day" is "accomplished," because desire does not have to suffer the religious deferral or expectation that a logic of signs creates (137). In a world of signs the fulfillment of desire is still something to come, because when objects become signs they cease to be ends. In a tautologous world, where the sun and moon have no symbolic significance beyond their sheer existence, our bodily experience of them as other bodies is sufficient. 34 The assumption that religion is primarily a set of beliefs about the way the world works, a form of pseudo-science that arose out primitive inquisition into perplexing experiences (dreams, death, and so on), is one of the major limitations of the early anthropology of religion that Stevens and many other modernists absorbed. 35 See Bernard Montagnes, The Doctrine of Analogy of Being According to Thomas Aquinas, trans E.

The experience of freedom from the "weight of primary noon" - made possible by metaphor - is like a mode of transcendence beyond the painful intensity of the world and the difficulty of existing as a finite particular that must accept the material bound- aries of its existence. 39 Martin Heidegger, The Principle of Reason, trans. Reginald Lilly (Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press, 1991), 48. 40 Ricoeur, 280. The criticism also came from materialist philosophies indebted to Marxism. As John Milbank writes, "In primitive times, so these accounts ran, the original sensory reference of language was lost sight of, and metaphoric substitution Matthew Mutter 767</page><page sequence="28">(or catachresis) necessary for the naming of near objects was falsely extended to the imagining of unreal 'spiritual' objects - for example, the 'breath' of human life became a hypostasized 'soul.' But the objection to this materialistic critique, already voiced by Vico and Herder in the eighteenth century, is that metaphoric substitution is always already involved in every signifying procedure, insofar as every articulation of 'some- thing' in terms of 'something else' necessary for there to be a 'meaning', involves more than the mere equivalence of a statement to a state of affairs" (Theology and Social Theory [New York: Blackwell, 1990], 179). 41 John Keats, The Major Works, ed. Elizabeth Cook (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 2001), 365. 42 What is at stake is not the classic empiricist suspicion that metaphor is a misleading ornamentation of literal truth derived from the senses, but a fear that metaphor is a way of losing experience as such. 43 For a wonderful analysis of how this same problem - the reinscription of the fall in the very act of trying to discard it - is ubiquitous in modern philosophy, see Stephen Mulhall, Philosophical Myths of the Fall (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 2005). 768 The Problem of a Secular Poetics</page></plain_text>
