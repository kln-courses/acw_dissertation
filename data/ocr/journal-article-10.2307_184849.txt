<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Reality of the Unobservable BY W. V. METCALF ]1-...3N THE issue of Nature for January I, I938, Professor Dingle has given us a remarkably clear and thorough analysis of what the physicist really means, or ought to mean, by the principle that only that which is observable is physically real, or has physical meaning. He uses the word "observable," I take it, to mean that which can be known by direct sense-perception. He distinguishes three different kinds of unobservables: One kind is the logically unobservable, the very definition of which involves a contradiction. An example would be a length which is both longer and shorter than a given length. All are agreed that an unobservable of this kind is without reality or meaning. A second kind is the practically unobservable, that which we can conceive of as observable by the known sense-faculties of man, but which we are prevented from observing by practical difficulties. The far side of the moon, the earth before man existed, one's own brain, would be examples. All agree that unobservables of this kind exist. The third kind is the physically unobservable, that which can never be observed by any existing sense-faculties of man. An example would be the simultaneity of two events occurring in different places. It is only this third kind of unobservables to which the physicist's principle applies. In analyzing the principle in question, Dingle presents two theories of sense-perception as alternatives. 337</page><page sequence="2">338 Reality of Unobservable The one, naive realism, holds that sense-perception is an act of direct KNOWLEDGE of the reality of an external object independent of the knower. The other, pure idealism, holds that the external world is a mental construct only, having no external existence independent of the mind of the observer. The naive realist, Dingle holds, can logically maintain the principle of the unreality of the unobservable only on the assump- tion that he knows all means of observation possible to man, an assumption of what Dingle labels "omniscience". Two alternatives are thus open to the physicist who maintains the principle under discussion. Either naive realism with omnis- cience as above defined; or pure idealism which denies the reality of an external world. Now practically no physicist believes that he has such "omniscience", and practically all physicists believe in the external reality of the physical world. The con- clusion is therefore inevitable that the physicist himself does not believe in the principle when he stops to analyze what it really means. The principle is both physically and philosophically untenable. The only reason the physicist has for denying the reality of the unobservable is that without this principle he has no method of distinguishing between irresponsible speculation about the "physical world" and rational belief about the same. This strikes one as a rather anthropomorphic method of discovering what is permitted to exist in the universe. But is the physicist. really in such serious difficulty in his search for reality? May not a better theory of the nature of sense-perception, together with a clearer understanding of the "scientific method", relieve his embarrassment? The two theories of sense-perception presented above are not the only alternatives. There is a third, the "causal theory", that leads to a firm belief in the reality of the external world independent of a knower, and that leaves our scientific method of hypothesis and verification unimpaired. According to this causal theory of perception, the ultimate, the primary, data for reasoning about the external world are</page><page sequence="3">W. V. Metcalf 3 39 not the so-called "facts of observation", i.e., of sense-perception. They are the subjective conscious experiences called sense- impressions.' We cannot doubt the reality of our sense-impres- sions without doubting fundamentally the data of conscious experience, our sole data for thought on any subject. But our sense-perceptions, our "observations of external objects", are something quite different. They are our conclusions, they are what we believe, about external objects as things that give rise to our sense-impressions. We can, and often do doubt these, for they often lead us to be "aware" of external objects that are not there. Practically all of us have a firm belief that things exist that are not a part of ourselves. According to the causal theory of sense-perception, we reach this belief by a process of inductive reasoning about the data of our subjective conscious experiences. In early infancy this is a slow and bungling process, but practice gradually transforms it into a subconscious instinctive habit of associating a given sense-impression with the concept of a certain external object. We thus acquire the habit of our mature years of being "aware" of the external object without any conscious inference. But frequent resulting errors keep us reminded that the element of inference is still involved. The scientific method by which we acquire this habit consists of four steps, repeated and combined in various ways: (I) Direct- ing attention to certain phenomena, which in the last analysis are always our own subjective experiences. (2) Imagining an hypothesis to "explain" the observed data, i.e., a general state- ment which if true would include these data as special cases. (3) Deducing the necessary implications of the hypothesis. (4) Further observation to see if these deduced implications agree with further experience. By repeated applications of thismethod to experience, and by using the conclusions so formed as data for new inductions, and by combining the separate processes in complex and intricately interwoven ways, we gradually build up a belief that things exist that are not apart ofourselves, and a belief that certain things are true about these external objects. 1 See two articles by the author, Phil. of Sci. 5, 354 (1938) and 6, 367 (I939).</page><page sequence="4">340 Reality of Unobservable I have summarized this "scientific method" in order to call attention to certain facts about it that have a bearing on our problem. I. Imagination, speculation, is an essential element in the process. It is the source of our hypotheses, the second step of our method. 2. This scientific method of ours gives us a way of distin- guishing between mere speculation and rational belief about ex- ternal realities. It is a method of speculation (second step) and verification (last two steps). And the test is not whether the predictions of the theory agree with observation by sense- perception only, but whether the hypothesis is the best explana- tion we can find for the sum total of subjective data. This leaves open the possibility of sound hypotheses about realities that cannot be observed by direct sense-perception. Simul- taneity of events separated in space cannot be "observed"; nor can the simultaneous values of the momentum and position of an electron, or the existence of such a particle; nor the far side of the moon; nor the stars that are behind clouds of inter- stellar dust. But rational belief in the reality of these things is not limited to our little powers of observation and measure- ment. It depends on whether the hypothesis of their reality is the best explanation we can find for the sum total of subjective experiences of human beings. If the hypothesis of the reality of the far side of the moon; of Newton's composition of absolute velocities; of the unobservable simultaneity of events; of the existence of unobservable mass particles, and the continuity of their motions;-if these hypotheses fit in together to give us the simplest and clearest self-consistent explanation of our ex- periences, then the belief in their validity is rational; regardless of whether or not they involve the reality of things that cannot be "observed". The one who believes only what he can "see" is as far from the rational searcher after reality as the one who believes all that he "sees". 3. This scientific method gives us a rational belief in external objects; without the assumption of "omniscience". The test is not the possibility of "observing" by sense-perception, but</page><page sequence="5">W. V. Metcalf 341 the power to explain subjective experience, and to prophesy future experiences. 4. The method leaves the distinction between the practically and the physically unobservable one of degree of evidence, rather than the fundamental one of the possibility or impossibility of existence. This third theory of sense-perception, then, leads to the same conclusion as that implied, but not admitted, in Professor Dingle's analysis, namely, T'he principle of the meaninglessness of the unobservable is both physically and philosophically untenable.
