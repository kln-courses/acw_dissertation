<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews A Medieval Critique of Anthropomorphism. Ibn al-Jawzi's Kitdb Akhbdr as Sifdt. A Critical Edition of the Arabic Text with Translation, Introduction and Notes. By Merlin Swartz. (Islamic Philosophy, Theology and Science, Texts and Studies, Vol. 46). Pp. xvi + 446. Leiden: Brill, 2002. EUR 104.00. This is a carefully produced and valuable contribution to our understanding of Hanbali Islam in the twelfth century. It contains an edition of a treatise by Ibn al-Jawzi in which he set out just what was wrong with the anthropomorphism held by many of his fel low Hanbalis. It also contains a translation of the treatise (pp. 77-280), and has as an appendix a translation of a response to Ibn al-Jawzi's defence of ta?wil written by cAlthI (d. 1236; pp. 284-97). The book opens with a valuable introductory essay which gives a biography of Ibn al-Jawzi (Chapter One, pp. 3-32), an analysis of the problems associated with the authorship and date of composition of the treatise (Chapter Two, pp. 33-45), a summary of the argument of the treatise (Chapter Four, pp. 46-64), and a description of the manuscript used for the edition (Chapter Five, pp. 65-70). Ibn al-Jawzi is an extremely interesting scholar, and certainly merits the attention given to him by Swartz in this book. Born in Baghdad some time between 1114 and 1116 to a family who, as he himself says, 'had spent their lives in the acquisition of material possessions' [p. 5, fn. 11], Ibn al-Jawzi devoted himself to 'seeking after knowledge'. He undertook advanced Qur'anic and hadith studies under the guidance of the leading Hanbalis of the city, after which he studied jurisprudence. He was sub sequently appointed to a number of chairs in jurisprudence in the madrasas of Baghdad. In 1194, for reasons to do with - among other things - his theological opin ions, he was exiled to Wasit, where he remained till 1199. On his return to Baghdad, he seems to have withdrawn from public life, and died in 1201. Even after death, however, Ibn al-Jawzi suffered the attacks of polemists. These attacks have proved to be influential in the West, and Swartz looks at some of the rea sons behind their influence. Ibn al-Jawzi's attitudes to 'extreme' forms of Sufism are well known from his Talbis Iblis (Delusions of the Devil). It is characteristic of Western scholarship that Ibn al-Jawzi tends to be taken as a result as an anti-Sufi, though he considered himself a Sufi [p. 15]. Swartz regrets in passing the fact that the Talbis was the first of Ibn al-Jawzi's writings to have been translated into a Western language [p. 28]: In the portions of Talbis selected for translation, Ibn al-Jawzi often comes across as a doggedly conservative, even fanatic, Hanbali and</page><page sequence="2">80 Journal of Qur'anic Studies virulently anti-Sufi. The general image of Ibn al-Jawzi reflected in orientalist literature, if anything, represents an intensification of the negative image found in medieval sources. If only, Swartz pursues the counterfactual, some of his other writings had first been translated [p. 29]: Far from being the strident, fanatic, reactionary Hanbali he has some times been made out to be in Western scholarship, it is clear that he represented precisely the most progressive wing of the school, a man with a breadth of outlook that seems not to have been characteristic of most 12th-century Hanbalis, a man who had a good grasp of medieval intellectual history and who himself was significantly influenced by Ashcarism, Muctazilism and other intellectual currents including the Kullabiya and quite possibly the Maturidiya. For all that, these outward-looking tendencies of Ibn al-Jawzi have not been empha sised by Western scholars of Islamic studies [p. 32]: For a variety of complex reasons, that [one-sided] image has persist ed, undoubtedly because it seems to confirm our image of Islam, espe cially in its traditionalist, Hanbali form. That image may in the end, however, say as much or more about us than it says about Ibn al-Jawzi or medieval Hanbalism. Why Ibn al-Jawzi fell foul of the polemists to the extent he did is not entirely clear, though the theological opinions mentioned above were one important factor. He belonged to that section of the Hanbali movement tending more to a rationalist approach to scripture and to allegorical exegeses of anthropomorphic verses. He was attracted to the methods of Ibnc Aqil, renowned for his rejection of taqlid and anthropomorphism. In any event, Swartz writes that it is clear 'from [cAlthi's] Risdla that Ibn al-Jawzi's Kitdb Akhbdr as-Sifdt had become a lightening-rod, as it were, for Hanbali anger' [p. 24]. The treatise itself is made up of three parts. The first examines the place of reason in matters of faith, the second, Qur'anic verses concerning the divine attributes, the third, Traditions concerning the divine attributes. There are many opportunities to see how Ibn al-Jawzi deals with Qur'anic verses and Traditions classically conceived as problematic (among many possible examples, see especially Q. 7:54, 'then He seat ed Himself on the Throne', pp. 153-64, and the Tradition 'God created Adam in his form', pp. 170-6). The first section of the treatise covers matters of more general consequence, for here Ibn al-Jawzi sets out the relationship between reason and revelation. Like the Ashcaris, Ibn al-Jawzi holds that the credibility and authority of revelation rest on the prior operation of reason [p. 80]:</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 81 The establishment of the contingency of the world, the existence of its Creator, His absolute uniqueness (wahddniya), those attributes that are necessary to Him (sifdt wdjibd), His revelation (risdla) and its possi bility (tajwiz calayhi), and all such related matters, including God's unity (tawhid) and prophecy (nubuwwa), are possible only through the exercise of reason (caql) ... But it will never be possible to determine with certainty that the words [attributed to God] are the actual words of God and His Prophet unless one knows that God exists ... And in this operation of reason, one must not blindly follow the beliefs of another [p. 100]: Ahmad ibn Hanbal once said: 'A man must be severely limited in his knowledge if he chooses to imitate [an yuqallida] another person in matters of belief.' According to Ibn al-Jawzi, the proof of God's existence can only work by proving the existence of an incorporeal god. That central attribute of God must then determine the reading of the scripture subsequently taken to be His revelation. Much of the interest of the treatise lies in the way Ibn al-Jawzi outlines and defends as Hanbali the use of ta3wll. There are many other interesting aspects of the treatise: its taxonomy of error in reading the Qur'an, its examination of figures of language, its familiarity with contemporary philosophical terminology and concepts, its for tunes among later Hanbalis. But the last aspect I wish to consider here is how much Ibn al-Jawzi's theological position demands that we nuance our understanding of the interrelation of the theological movements of the period and the sharpness of the dif ferences among them. I could not avoid thinking of his younger Ashcari contempo rary, Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (d. 1210), who at one point in his al-Tafsir al-kabir lam poons the - probably Hanbali - anthropomorphists in terms I think Ibn al-Jawzi would have enjoyed [al-Tafsir al-kabir (Cairo, 1933), Vol. 26, p. 229.9-22]: Whoever says God is composed of members and parts must either affirm only those members of which mention is found in the Qur'an, or affirm more. [RazT then sets out Q. 28:88, Q. 54:14, Q. 39:56, Q. 36:71, Q. 68:42.] The gist of all this is a bare patch of face with sev eral eyes, a single side, several hands and a single leg. This is obvi ously the ugliest of forms, and were it a slave, no one would want to buy him. So how can any sane person claim that the Lord of the Worlds may be described by this form? Assuming the second alterna tive, that is, that one is not limited to the members mentioned in the Qur'an, but may postulate more or less in accordance with allegorical interpretation (taDwil) - then the school of construing the text accord</page><page sequence="4">82 Journal of Qur'anic Studies ing to its bare literal meaning would collapse, and one would have to accept the proofs of reason. Of course, Ibn al-JawzT was fairly cautious of the kalam (witness the section aptly given by Swartz the title The Dangers of Kalam', pp. 104-20), its systematicity and its claims to comprehensiveness. The proponents of kalam 'seek to probe the divine realities themselves; reason, however, is powerless to apprehend the wisdom (hikma) to which God alone has access' [p. 112]. Nor would a mutakallim like Razi confine his arguments about controversial points to the proper occasions and audiences (cf. p. 171, n. 4). For all that, the leading Ashcari and the leading Hanbali of the day were guided in their reading of the Qur'an and the Traditions by the same determining vision of the relation of reason to revelation. Two quibbles in closing. I have a minor worry about Swartz's (and Makdisi's) use of 'progressive' in talking about Ibn al-JawzT and Ibn cAqfl's theological position (e.g. the quote given above from p. 29; cf. Makdisi's entry in the Encyclopaedia of Islam on Ibn ?Aqil); the word seems to me to imply an inappropriate value-judgement. Secondly, the book is laden with footnotes, a number of which could have been incor porated in the text, or omitted altogether. But this is a well-produced and satisfying book, and all who work on Islamic intellectual history of the 12th and 13th centuries will find it absorbing. TONY STREET</page></plain_text>
