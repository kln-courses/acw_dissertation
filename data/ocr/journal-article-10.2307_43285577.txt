It is these Flügelfiguren that Thomsen focuses upon in a cross-regional study that has much to yield to students both of Greek iconology and religion. A close reading of the Cécrops Painter's much- discussed calyx-crater in Adolphseck (ARV2 1346.1) serves as introduction. As becomes clear from the outset, Thomsen is refreshingly uncon- cerned about providing specific names for the winged (and unwinged) personnel of the imagery. Rather, he aims at clarifying their function as visual markers and at grasping the collective notions underlying the complex relations between the gods and mortals depicted. He proceeds to do so in three main chapters: a short but convincing essay on the visual semantics of wings, which, it turns out, are less about flying than about rash movement and godlike, virtual ubiquity; and two longer case-studies on small-sized winged figures in Archaic Laconian vase-painting (tentatively referred to as eudaimones) and the figure of Nike in Attic red-figure respectively. Both chapters are rounded out by remarks on other winged figures of the period; in these odds-and-ends-sections there is a certain feel of the 2002 Berlin dissertation the book stems from. An excellently-worded conclusion and an English summary precede the copious footnotes and a rich catalogue of the roughly hundred vessels discussed in some detail. The book is agreeably produced with but very few typos; the vast majority of the photographs are of good or excellent quality. To summarize the main points of the argument: in early Archaic imagery wings serve to denote superhuman, i.e. divine, status. This changes gradually with the development of a more differ- entiated iconography in the course of the sixth century BC. Winged anthropomorphic figures are now used to visualize the invisible, benevolent agency of the gods in human (viz. aristocratic) affairs, the Laconian eudaimones and their near siblings in East Greek iconography (on which 134) probably being the first attested instances. Their presence effectively connotes fertility in the broadest sense, including well-being and success, notions connected to the sphere of the Archaic 'Great Goddess' (especially 93-104). The phenomenon lives on in the full-blown Classical iconography, namely of Nike, Eros and Iris, who can be understood as both boundary-crossing 'deities of intervention' in their own right and as powerful emanations of other gods. This latter point is elaborated in some detail for the special case of Athena and Nike at Athens, including a fruitful analysis of the Sanctuary of Athena Nike and the iconography of its two cult statues (224-35). This forcefully argued interpretation is perhaps less bound to generate debate than Thomsen's underlying views of Archaic polis religion, according to which a 'Great Goddess' with henotheistic traits is supplanted by the more 'intel- lectual' Homeric pantheon in the course of the Archaic period (149-51). Indeed, the analysis as a whole, while being largely unconcerned with political history, is very much inclined towards putting its findings into the broad context of contemporary religious Weltanschauung (cf. 127-30 with remarks on the concept of 'intercon- nected/separative cosmologies' crucial to Thomsen's interpretive framework). In its endeavour to argue strictly within the visual vocabulary of its corpus, the study shows exemplary methodological rigour. Thomsen's willingness to accept (if not to embrace) the varia- tions and logical inconsistencies inherent to systems of both religious belief and visual repre-</page><page sequence="2">270 REVIEWS OF BOOKS sentation makes for an undogmatic and ultimately pragmatic approach to the complexities of our evidence. Problems, however, persist, as Thomsen himself is well aware. His highly abstract readings tend to level out actual differ- ences within the imagery (for example 247 on Iris and Nike). For instance, the close parallel drawn between the intervention of Flügelfiguren in Laconian symposium scenes and in images of the 'Laconian rider' is at odds with the figures' differing placement and orientation (compare instead the Caeretan hydria with Europa and the bull, fig. 55). In a similar vein, the use made of overarching religious concepts like the 'Great Goddess' (especially 101, 180) or 'fertility', applied inter alia to Athena (265) and Hermes (273), verges on straining. Finally, the focus on Nike and the Laconian eudaimones tends to emphasize the benign dimension of divine inter- vention; more space dedicated to figures like Eos or Eros (they are dealt with but briefly on 274-75 and 263-72 respectively) would have opened up the field for more ambivalent aspects. Thomsen's style is not exactly succinct and its peculiar mixture of colloquialisms and at times rather involute clauses may prove trying for non- German readers; at the same time his writing is throughout characterized by an unusual degree of intellectual frankness, disclosing the foundations of his approach and its strengths as well as its shortcomings. Far from restricting itself to the particular iconographie feature it takes as a starting point (Thomsen himself refers to the Flügelfiguren as a mere McGuffin: 5), the book provides a thoughtful and sound exploration of ancient Greek notions and discourses expressed almost exclu- sively within contemporary visual culture.
