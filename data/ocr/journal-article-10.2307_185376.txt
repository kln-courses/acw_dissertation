Fellow of the Royal Society and Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford, Mr. Coulson was invited to deliver the eleventh Arthur Stanley Eddington memorial lecture at Cambridge, and did so on the twenty-first of April, 1958. Since the purpose of the lectures is to further Eddington's "concern for relating the scientific, the philo- sophical and the religious methods of seeking truth," it is not surprising that Coulson concludes, in favor of religion, that "science can only fulfil its deepest function within the idea of God." (p. 51) It is noteworthy that the subject is the relation between scientific inquiry and the idea of God, rather than between science or scientists and the deity itself; for then one can make a mistake in construing one's evidence without fear of committing sacrilege 372</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 373 or blasphemy. Earlier writers, too eager perhaps to avoid the sin of speaking the unspeak- able name and its equally sinful alternative of not speaking it at all, have usually made appeal to a conception of the deity to explain those events of nature which the natural sciences have to a certain point failed to bring within the pale of human reason. This Professor Coulson refers to as the substantive approach, and he clearly recognizes that such a formulation of the relationship between the disciplines of science and religion holds out little hope for the devotees of the latter. To the extent that the sciences pro- gress in "filling in the gaps" it becomes less and less necessary to hypothesize the existence of God, as the famous conversation between Laplace and Napoleon makes abundantly clear. In the eighteenth century deism was the suggested way out of this predicament, but Professor Coulson is a Christian and a theist. He attempts to show that if the conclusions of science exclude the necessity of God its procedures do not, and that if properly viewed these procedures will yield the beatific vision. His method is to examine the "(presuppositions" informing scientific inquiry. The first and most apparent of these presuppositions is the scientist's own belief in the efficacy of science: that the world is not alien to us, that in seeking we may know, and that in order to know intellectual integrity is both necessary and possible. The first extension of this notion of "integrity" is the recognition of the dependency of the scientist ("a creaturely relationship," p. 29) upon the structures of the universe, some of which are known and others remaining unknown and merely "sensed." Myriads are the scientists having felt the joy of creation, the excitement of dicovery, all the emotional concommitants of successful inquiry which have led thinkers, and Einstein was one, to suppose as necessary the attitude of the religious devotee or lover as an emotional precondition to any scientific inquiry whatso- ever. Notwithstanding this obvious confusion of effect for cause, it is stated that judg- ments and value experiences are interfused in the method of the scientist; there is beauty, art, social influence and social effect within the very spirit of science, and the beauty, patterns, and satisfactions felt by the inquirers constitute evidence of a "spiri- tual" world. (p. 36) Such, in the abstract, is Professor Coulson's thesis. To be more concrete, the implica- tions of our belief in science's efficacy may be reduced to two: (1) the recognition that science is impossible without scientists, and that scientists make judgments of value as well as of fact; their language, at least in its preparatory and pre-scientific stages, transcends the purely scientific discussion of experiences; and (2) in their desire to reach satisfaction in the understanding of the universe, scientists are "obliged to pass beyond a purely scientific universe." (p. 35) Eddington himself is cited in evidence. The knowl- edge of nature awaited the evolution of man, and man himself has evolved within nature. Each is dependent upon the other as both depend upon God: "Nature and man are of divine origin, and they owe their close and intimate relationship-their unity-to the fact that both are expressions of God. Here is the validity of that truth and beauty which we have already seen to be inseparable from the practice of science." (p. 37) The dangers of religion, or of the religious interpretation of the universe, have always been its anthropomorphic language. One must not construe religion in its narrow, but in its broadest sense. Where it might be too "narrow" to say 'God is personal,' this reviewer fails to understand the significance of the "broadest" interpretation: 'God is at least personal; you cannot do justice to your varied experiences, scientific and other, in language which is less than personal.' (p. 41) The first clause contains the same assertion as the "narrower" formulation, and the substance of the second clause is, if not false, at least doubtful. Lord Tennyson had long ago calmed many an irritated conscience with his new creed: There lives more faith in honest doubt/ Believe me, than in half the creeds. E. F.
