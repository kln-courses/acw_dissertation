Volume VI: The Cypro-Archaic Period Mon- sters, Animals and Miscellanea, 1996. xii + 111 pp., 75 figures, 50 plates, 1 map. Cloth. C?25. With the publication of these two volumes, the ambi- tious six-volume Coroplastic Art of Ancient Cyprus nears completion.1 The series has already become a standard reference work that provides an invaluable compendium of far-flung and poorly known Cypriot terracottas, from the Chalcolithic period to the end of the Cypro-Archaic (ca. 475 B.C.) when local production becomes strongly derivative of Greek styles. As with the previous volumes, Karageorghis's objec- tive here is simply to present a large number of examples of the various known types, primarily in catalog format. It should be stressed that this is in no sense a corpus2 but rather a selection: an effort toward broad representation has clearly been made, and the state of preservation ap- pears to play an important role, but au fond the grounds for inclusion seem to be defined by the taste and experi- ence of the author. Particularly welcome is the compila- tion of material from poorly documented 19th century explorations at major sites by figures such as Ohnefalsch- Richter, Cesnola, and Walters. Collections from 15 coun- tries and 17 public and private collections within Cyprus are represented in these two volumes.3 The objects are organized according to broad "the- matic" criteria: typological factors such as pose and associ- ated attributes in the case of the anthropomorphic figures (Vol. V[A]), zoological or inanimate prototypes for the nonhuman representations (Vol. VI). While most of the groups are introduced with some general comments (e.g., on iconography, method of manufacture, regional work- shops, stylistic affinities), Karageorghis makes no attempt at detailed stylistic or chronological analysis. Rather, he expresses his hope that the material assembled will serve as a foundation for such studies by others in the future. Volumes V and VI constitute companions to Volume IV (Karageorghis 1995), which surveyed small male figu- rines of the same period, and indeed they should be used in close conjunction with that earlier volume. The lines of demarcation used to assign pieces to one volume or an- other are not always clearly drawn: in the absence of gen- der-specific characteristics (e.g., beards or breasts), as is often the case, the presumption of "male" (i.e., Vol. IV) or "female" (Vol. V) sometimes rests on evidence as tenuous as the amount of jewelry worn, red spots on cheeks, un- defined "facial characteristics," or "general appearance."4 Several figures wearing the conical headdress typical of</page><page sequence="2">82 BOOK REVIEWS BASOR 317 male figurines, and without breasts or other distinguishing characteristics (Vol. V[A], pls. 32:7-8, 57:1), are listed among the females. Even when specific sexual attributes are present, the issue can remain unresolved-witness the figure with male genitalia nursing an infant at its ample breasts (Vol. V[A], pl. 17:4). Neither is assignment to Volume VI as clear-cut as might be assumed.5 Cart and ship models with passengers, and horses with riders, appear in Volume IV, while those of essentially the same types but without associated human figures are found in Volume VI. Yet all Cypro-Archaic naYskoi (shrine models), even those containing figures, ap- pear in Volume VI. A figure widely regarded as a monkey is included in Volume V(A) (p. 30, pl. 17:2), rather than with the other monkeys in Volume VI. Indeed, it might have been easier for the reader (and cheaper for the pur- chaser) if Volumes IV, V, and VI had been published as one large volume, instead of three small ones requiring the user to consult each. Karageorghis also acknowledges the chronological un- certainties of many pieces, which made the decision to list some of them in either Volume II (1993a), which included Cypro-Geometric III, or the succeeding Cypro-Archaic vol- umes a rather arbitrary choice (e.g., Vol. V[A], pp. 7 [no. 26], 17-18). For some reason, he has occasionally included figures in the Archaic volumes that are probably later (e.g., Vol. VI, pp. ix, 41 [nos. 14-15]). Indeed even the size- based distinction between Volume III (1993b) and volumes IV-VI is not always hard and fast (e.g., Vol. V[A], p. 55). These latest volumes follow the format of their prede- cessors: a short preface, chapters containing the catalog of objects along with brief commentary, followed by use- ful indexes listing the current location of the objects and the original provenience when known, a general index, and a comprehensive list of references. A map of sites men- tioned in the text and chronological tables are helpful in placing the pieces in time and space. Volume V(A) con- sists of three chapters, each devoted to a different manu- facturing technique of the female figurines;6 Volume VI is divided into four chapters according to the category of creature being represented. Good quality and generous il- lustrations (black-and-white photographic plates and many line drawings), along with the full and detailed catalog entries, provide excellent documentation of the items. A color frontispiece to Volume V(A) renders the actual ap- pearance of four figures with great accuracy and serves as a vivid reminder of the shortcomings of black-and-white illustration. While Karageorghis defends his "thematic" approach to organizing his material (e.g., Vol. V[A], p. 35), this reviewer continued to be frustrated by the resulting frag- mentation of groups known to be from a single archaeo- logical context (cf. Herscher 1996: 79). A comprehensive index of provenience promised for the final volume will certainly assist the reader in (laboriously) reconstructing these groups-that is, if the reader knows to look for it in Volume V(B).7 The subject of Volume V encompasses a vast amount of material, since Archaic Cypriot female terracottas are much more common than male ones and exhibit more variety. As Karageorghis notes (pp. 49, 74), the introduc- tion of the mold around the middle of the seventh century led to a dramatic increase in the number of figurines, as mass production replaced small workshops, but the quality declined significantly and the "primitive liveliness" of the earlier figures was lost (p. 80). Indeed the "imaginative spirit" of those earlier figurines is so noteworthy that Karageorghis deviates just this once from his "thematic" organization to discuss the handmade Lapithos workshop as a group (pp. ix, 35-45).8 Otherwise, a selection of material from the later Lap- ithos workshop and from Larnaca Kamilarga is dispersed into several thematic groups in Vol. V[A] (pp. 49, 53-54, 57) and among other volumes. Examples from an impor- tant cache from Ayios Tychonas are spread among several sections in Vol. V(A) (pp. 7, 24, 53) and also appear in Volumes III and IV.9 The well-known figurines from Ayia Irini are found in Volumes II, III, IV, and V (even the specialized class of centaurs from the site is divided be- tween Volumes II and VI). Occasionally some groups are discussed briefly within the listing of types, but the ac- count is still limited: for example, 4 of a total of 34 pieces belonging to a group from Saittas Livadhia are discussed (p. 9), along with the observation that about half were the type with uplifted arms, but the nature of the others is not mentioned. Yet while the format tends to blur whatever archaeo- logical context the material may have had, it does serve well for a work intended primarily as a reference and source of comparanda. It also illuminates certain typolog- ical distinctions that may be significant (e.g., in terms of cult practice), such as the fact that more male figurines than female are depicted holding animal offerings: fe- males almost always hold other kinds of objects (cf. Vol. V[A], p. 27).10 The format demonstrates that a preponder- ance of the female type with uplifted arms is connected with the cult of Aphrodite." In the Larnaca (Kition) area it appears that a female divinity played a major role (p. 74), and a wreath-like offering, which Karageorghis identifies as the ceremonial bread koulouri, is also characteristic of that area. It is doubtless significant that most of the so- called tambourine players (a type with Near Eastern ante- cedents) are known to come from Amathus (p. 30), where there is also a prevalence of genre scenes (pp. 45-47). Similarly Volume VI reveals some evidence for reli- gious practices. The Ptah-Patek type of "monster" (Vol. VI, p. 14) is sufficiently known to indicate that it was pop- ular in both Amathus and Kition. The pig may have a reli- gious association with Salamis (p. 40). Nar'skoi receive fairly extensive discussion: nearly all with a known prove-</page><page sequence="3">2000 BOOK REVIEWS 83 nience come from Amathus and usually are connected to the cult of Astarte. Indeed, the index of proveniences shows the predominance of Amathus as the source of all the types of figurines included in Vol. VI, particularly the inanimate objects. This could have warranted further dis- cussion, for example, in regard to the intriguing Amathus Tomb 83, excavated by the British Museum in 1894, which contained a wide variety of very interesting figurines, in- cluding naiskoi, two different types of carts, seven boat models, horses and riders, birds, and other animals. On the other hand, bull figurines are known from all re- gions of the island. Their religious significance is attested by their continuity from the Late Bronze Age and by the fact that they have been excavated from both sanctuaries and tombs. In contrast, all the bird figures with a known context come from tombs (p. 49). Volume VI is a short volume, but it still contains a wide variety of terracotta objects and models, reflecting the rich variety and imagination of the Cypriot coroplast. Of particular interest are the groups of centaurs, shrine models (nai'skoi), and ship models. An appendix by J. Richard Steffy discusses the latter in the light of informa- tion on ancient ship construction known from underwater archaeology. Within the four major chapters, the objects are divided by types (within which different methods of manufacture may be represented), but frequently the simplicity of the coroplastic style renders these assignments extremely ten- uous (e.g., Vol. VI, p. ix). For example, within the general category of "Mammals" (chapter 2), it is often unclear whether a horse, bull, goat, or dog is intended.12 Neverthe- less, it is apparent that certain creatures (e.g., horses, bulls, dogs, and birds) are much more common than others. Among the inanimate objects, cart and ship models are best represented. In contrast, furniture models are rare, espe- cially in comparison with other places in the Near East. The selection at times seems somewhat arbitrary: no animal heads attached to jugs or wall brackets are in- cluded (although some appear in Vol. II), while chests and thymiateria (incense burners) are not necessarily "mod- els" but utilitarian objects in themselves. The division be- tween figurines and zoomorphic vases is also sometimes blurred, as several of the latter are included in this volume (pp. 32-33), although most of them have been excluded from the series. Some of the bird figurines are hollow but are considered "not exactly" askoi: further, some of them may have been attached to vases (p. 49). Throughout both volumes Kargeorghis emphasizes the chronological uncertainties of his material.13 Few pieces were found during controlled excavations, so most of his attributions are based on stylistic assumptions. The very important category of ship models is just one example of how murky the situation can be: Karageorghis's presenta- tion reveals that the same examples have been dated Late Cypriot, Cypro-Geometric, or Cypro-Archaic by different authorities who have published studies of Cypriot ship models. Sometimes dating is difficult even when an excavated provenience exists, since tombs were frequently used for long spans of time (e.g., Vol. V[A], pp. 71-72 [no. 33]; Vol. VI, pp. 27-28 [nos. 23-24]). In these cases, individ- ual pieces are still ultimately dated on stylistic grounds, sometimes with a high degree of subjectivity: sphinx no. 2 (Vol. VI, p. 10) comes from an Amathus tomb dated Cypro-Classical I but is included here as a possible CA II "survival." Yet centaurs nos. 4-5 from Ayia Irini (Vol. VI, pp. 3-4) are considered to "stylistically... very closely resemble" another from Ayia Irini that was included in Volume II and dated earlier. One group of birds (a) in Volume VI (p. 49) is thought by Karageorghis to be "close to" those of the Cypro-Geo- metric III period, which appear in the earlier Volume III. Those are dated to CG III because they have archaeologi- cal evidence to support that date, yet these similar ones are assigned to Cypro-Archaic simply because they lack ar- chaeological evidence for the earlier date. Under these conditions it is not clear to this reader why they are not dated stylistically to CG III. Even stranger is that no. 1 of the group (p. 50) comes from a tomb dated to the end of CG III/beginning of CA I-why is it not then considered more likely to be CG III? The pitfalls of stylistic dating are well illustrated by three bull figurines from Palaepaphos Skales Tomb 81, which come from a good context that can be dated no later than CA I, compared with a similar example that comes from an Amathus tomb dated no earlier than CA II. As Ka- rageorghis notes, "this simple style does not change dras- tically from the CA I to the CA II" (Vol. VI, pp. 33-34). As in the previous volumes, the publication of so much material without provenience raises difficult issues of au- thenticity and/or Cypriot origin (cf. Herscher 1996: 81).14 One must wonder why certain pieces of apparently un- known origin are even considered Cypriot, such as the pig no. 14 (now in the Eretz Israel Museum), and pig no. 13 (now in Birmingham), which is of a type distinctly differ- ent from known Cypriot examples (Vol. VI, p. 41). Kara- georghis admits that the Cypriot provenience of a group he previously published as Cypriot is doubtful (Vol. V[A], p. 46, fig. 24), as is a dog in a private collection (Vol. VI, p. 44, no. 25) that he nonetheless includes. Also raising suspicion is an incomplete oddity (Vol. V[A], fig. 22), now in Turin, with unusual (for Cyprus) applied features. Yet one must admit that another very strange example (Vol. V[A], p. 28, pl. 16:4) would probably be equally suspect, were it not from an excavated Cypriot context. And how fortunate for scholarship that the seated figure flanked by sphinxes is known to have been excavated at the Ayia Irini sanctuary (Vol. V[A], p. 34, no. 5), since it is one of a very few female figurines among the hundreds from this sanctuary and represents a unique composition.</page><page sequence="4">84 BOOK REVIEWS BASOR 317 Karageorghis is to be commended for the completion of this monumental work. It will surely remain an irre- placeable tool for future research, as its author intended, stimulating and facilitating new studies and better under- standing of Cypriot terracottas. Ellen Herscher Washington, DC 20008 herschere @yahoo.com NOTES 1The final fascicle, Part B of Volume V, by Jacqueline Karageorghis on small Cypro-Archaic moldmade female figurines, appeared as this review went to press. For a re- view of the first four volumes, see Herscher 1996. 2Except in a few cases of highly specialized types, such as naiskoi and chairs (Vol. VI, pp. 57, 81). 3 Among the entries are numerous objects whose loca- tion is given as the Hadjiprodromou Collection, Famagusta, and some from the Famagusta District Museum: both these collections are no longer accessible and are presumed to have been dispersed. 4Karageorghis has even changed his own opinion on the sex of some of the "tambourine players" since a 1987 publication (Vol. V[A], p. 30). 5The "Miscellanea" of the title consist of replicas of inanimate objects, such as shrines/houses, carts, ships, fur- niture, and weapons. 6Handmade/wheelmade (for which the body may be either a solid handmade cylinder or a hollow wheelmade form, to which handmade head, arms, and other features were added); wheelmade body with molded face; and a very brief chapter listing a few examples of seated fig- ures with a handmade body and molded face, all of which portray subjects related to maternity. As mentioned above (n. 1), entirely moldmade figures (most dating to Cypro- Archaic II) appear in Part B of Volume V. 7It is unfortunate that this most welcome index could not have appeared in the logical location, the end of Vol- ume VI. 8While most of them have a very close stylistic affinity, in fact only a few of those listed are actually documented as coming from Lapithos. 9The author stresses the importance of future exhaus- tive studies of the entire corpus from these workshops (p. x). A future detailed study of the uses of specific molds would be of great value in interpreting many of the unpro- venienced figures. 10Indeed, with the exception of one figure that actu- ally has breasts depicted (Vol. V[A], pl. 40:2), most of the few "females" holding quadrupeds could just as well be male (cf. Vol. V[A], pp. 58-60). One example holding a "kid(?)" is mistakenly listed among the tambourine play- ers (Vol. V[A], pp. 69-70 [no. 6], pl. 46:5). 11Additional examples are discussed in Volume II (1993a). 120ne example (fig. 16) was called a "monster with a leopard's head" by Cesnola, a monkey by J. L. Myres, and a bear by Karageorghis. And certainly the identification (as well as the date) of piece no. 3 (p. 47, pl. 28:3)-said to be a "worm"-seems highly doubtful. 13For example, the CA II date given for all the "mice" figurines is merely "presumed" (Vol. VI, p. 46). 14Karageorghis's routine use of the term "provenance uncertain" rather than "provenance unknown" is somewhat puzzling: if he means that a tentative provenance has been suggested for these pieces, he does not reveal what it is.
