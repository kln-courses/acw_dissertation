Peter Coates's book does its job extremely well. The subject is announced in the title, and the thesis in the subtitle, which is adapted from John Higham's classic history of anti-immigrant sentiment in the United States, Strangers in the Land (1955). Coates presents a well informed and judicious survey of Americans' attitudes towards non-native species, and demonstrates the ease with which writers moved back and forth between the human and the non-human in their dis? cussions of "immigrants" to the United States. Three narrative chapters are devoted, respectively, to birds (with a focus on the English sparrow in the late nineteenth century), agricultural and ornamental plants and their pests (with greatest attention to the U. S. Department of Agri? culture in the early twentieth century), and trees (with a major section on eucalyptus in California in recent decades). Substantial introductory and concluding chapters address theoretical and contemporary issues. Coates surveys the thoughts of a large cast of characters ranging from academic and government scientists to nature writers, journalists, and novelists. Ornithologist Eliot Coues shares space with poet William Cullen Bryant; economic botanist David Fairchild with Betty Smith (A Tree Grows in Brooklyn); and contemporary ecologists Stanley Temple and Bruce Coblenz with T. Coraghessian Boyle (Tortilla Curtain). Coates has done the hard work in the National Archives, the scientific grey literature, and newspapers. He displays the extent to which these different types of people have been mutually talking - if often without much listening - about the qualities of recently-arrived animals and plants and their rights to "citizenship" in the United States. Coates shows beyond doubt how extensive the overlap in attitudes about human immigrants and immigrant species has been. He conveys this persuasively in his initial case study (one quarter of the book's narrative) on the English sparrow. Imported to Brooklyn in 1852 to fight canker worms, it also picked undigested seeds from horse manure and thereby multiplied rapidly throughout the country. Its detractors described it as a "Cockney" and "disgusting exotic," while its defenders praised it as a "tough little Briton." This polarized anthropomorphic language was applied to many different organisms up to the present; and the direction of the human-animal comparison was frequently inverted so that animals - mostly insects - provided linguistic resources for stigmatizing groups such as Italians and Japanese. American biological</page><page sequence="2">774 BOOK REVIEWS nativism was not merely a matter of language, but also of particular notable people: Coates describes how major figures in scientific eugenics and racism, including Madison Grant, Arthur Estabrook, and Charles Goethe, encompassed both themselves and robins in their concern for "native Americans," and they prominently included the charge of "pot hunting" rare native birds in their criticisms of immigrants. Coates asserts, however, that concern about immigrant and invasive species was not primarily an expression of nativist ideology. He emphasizes that knowledgeable Americans had substantial material reasons - both ecological and economic - to want to exclude or exter? minate Hessian flies, Japanese beetles, or Australian eucalyptus. He stresses that anthropomorphic metaphors, loaded as they might be, were often merely "stale" but arresting literary devices; ethnically stig? matizing an organism reinforced prejudice mostly when that prejudice was already virulent. Coates applies these insights to the new wave of concern about invasive species that has arisen in the last two decades. He suggests that, with the exception of "unrepresentative individual voices" (who included, he notes, Paul Ehrlich and David Pimentel), ecologists did not link their campaigns against what were frequently called "alien" species to opposition to immigration. From Coates's perspective, fears that tamarisk exterminators are "weed Nazis" are overblown. He offers cautionary advice about language, and suggests more openness to "newcomers," but affirms that contemporary invasion ecology is scientifically sound and morally inoffensive. Jacket testimo? nials from leading invasion ecologists Daniel Simberloff and Dov Sax endorse the book's perspective. Coates's analysis of metaphor is cogent, and his conclusion that political nativism is much less important in contemporary anti-invasive science and activism than in earlier decades is basically right. A larger question arises, however, concerning his framing of the present in relation to the past. I raise this point because his review of scholarship in both history and ecology is so extensive; my concern is that the book may close off rather than open up productive fields for historical inquiry. How a historical narrative ends depends substantially on where it begins. Coates follows Edward Tenner's wonderful discussion in Why Things Bite Back (1996) by starting the American organism-migration story with the English sparrow. This vertebrate was intentionally introduced into an established urban environment. It had relatively slight ecological and economic impacts, but was highly visible to scientists, poets, and journalists. It thus generated extended and</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 775 wide-ranging discussion. The particular qualities of the sparrow underpin Coates's narrative and theses. Slightly different emphases, however, w7ould generate different sto? ries, more open-ended narratives, and more important issues. 1607 (Jamestown), 1783 (sovereignty), or 1848 (the takeover of northern Mexico) are more significant origin-points in American environmental history than 1852. Organisms that caused major material changes, such as the earthworm, Hessian fly, yellow fever mosquito, or crested wheatgrass, were more influential than sparrows. Broad migratory trends were more consequential than the claims of individual species to "citizenship." And organized efforts to control immigrant species were more important than the texture of Americans' perceptions about them. This last issue is most relevant to historians of biology. Coates's American-studies serial presentation of diverse voices generates a his? torical landscape that is largely undifferentiated; we do not see how people with particular backgrounds and interests - in this domain, activists and bureaucrats with scientific identities - used research, status, publicity, and access to state power to manage biota. Coates approaches these kinds of problems at the end of his narrative, which is devoted to arguments extending from the late 1970s to the early 1990s about removing eucalyptus from government-owned Angel Island in San Francisco Bay. This Australian-origin tree was damned as a gloomy and fire-prone alien excrescence, and eulogized as a beautiful part of California's heritage. Scientists advocated from both sides; messy political manuevering resulted in the removal of most - but not all - of the trees. The message to be drawn from such a large and slow spreading species, and from such a singular site, however is unclear. The contemporaneous disputes over the Nature Conservancy's schemes to replace the mixed-origin woodlands of many Chicagoland parks with supposedly primordial oak savannah, analyzed in Restoring Nature (edited by Paul H. Gobster and R. Bruce Hull, 2000), were environ? mentally more significant and their implications are more provocative. Studying action shifts our attention from the intermittently loud but peripheral sentiment of nativism to the continuing deep rumble of American nationalism. More strategically, it enables us to get past the static polarity of ideology and science to understand how people with changing kinds of knowledge and interests interacted with organisms that were rapidly evolving.
