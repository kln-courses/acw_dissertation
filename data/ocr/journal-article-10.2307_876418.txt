Bronze sculpture, 8 by 342 by 25 in (Fig.8o) Alberto Giacometti, painter and sculptor, was recognised as one of the most important artists of his time, and his reputation has continued to grow since his death. Without claiming him as the greatest, one could well put him forward as the most typical European sculptor of the century, since no other sculptor has known so well how to express the existentialism which dominated the middle decades. This reputation is founded, however, on his post-war manner of thin elongated figures, like newly-created nervous armatures lightly dipped in matter which coagulates and adheres in awkward clots. The present acquisition comes from an earlier period which is far less well known, and of which there are few examples in British collections. The later work, though it may look strange, is based on prolon- ged observation modified by Giacometti's optical peculiarities and psychic attitudes. The optical difficulties were apparent to him early on and caused him, at the age of 24, to give up working from nature for ten years, from 1925 to 1935. During those years Giacometti practised an art of symbolic form and was drawn, inevitably, to Surrealism. His work of these years seems, in retrospect, to have been in the main stream of modern art in a way that the well-known figures of his later life cannot be. Some of these early sculptures are compact forms which are made to carry a highly concentrated charge of meaning, and anticipate the early carved forms of Barbara Hepworth, to name only one. Other works are visible demonstrations of ideas in surrealist form, for example the idea of danger symbolised as a tiny head menaced by a sharp form pointed at the eye. These more obvious- ly symbolic works are very conceptual in the sense that the actual execution bored Giacometti and he sometimes entrusted it to somebody else. This was quite contrary to Giacometti's later practice but was prophetic of avant-garde attitudes in the I960's. Femme Egorgie (which can only be clumsily translated as woman with her throat cut) is probably the best sculpture of this whole period. It is a moving and convincing example of the art of 'equivalent forms' - that is the art of finding forms expressive of the phenomenon that inspired them, without being like them. Here the rounded forms are expressive of the soft body, the open concave forms are expressive of abandonment and violation, while the jagged shapes, like a covering cut open and curled back, symbolise the nature of the violence. The most surrealist feature is the terribly recognisable windpipe form with a small nick in it, terminating in a tiny head like those used by Picasso both before and after this time. One remarkably 'modern' feature is the limp pod-like form which is attached to the arm by a ring and can be placed in various positions. All these considerations make the Femme Egorgde a highly im- portant work of modern sculpture. It might be said that the art of equivalent forms is as central and essential to the whole of modern art, as existentialism is to the whole picture of twentieth- century life. DOUGLAS IHALL (Reprinted from the National Galleries of Scotland Bulletin [1970], No.I). Another recent acquisition of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art is Warrior Bird by Elisabeth Frink (b. 1930), bronze, I4) in. high. It was presented by Mrs M. E. B. Scott Hay (Fig.8i). The work of Elisabeth Frink represents in its most typical form one prominent aspect of advanced British sculpture in the fifties. That was, subjecting the forms of animal and human figures to a kind of interbreeding with each other and with other extraneous forms, like those for example that might be suggested by the material. The mutations brought about in this way gave this kind of sculpture a ferocity which was one fairly superficial expression of the Angst of the time. On the other hand this sculpture forms part of an aspect of modern art which can be called metamorphism, the representation of one thing in the guise of another, which is far from superficial. On the contrary it is central to twentieth-century art and indeed latent in the art of many previous ages. Elisabeth Frink's work at this time was dominated by com- paratively few forms of which a man and a bird are the most frequently seen and the most frequently conjoined. The Frink birds are not really creatures of the air and are usually planted on more or less human legs (whereas the figure of the man is sometimes flying through the air like a projectile). In this example the bird is braced against the ground and has lunged forward to seize a prey in its formidable beak. The mechanics of this movement are not so much of bone and muscle as of metal, because the nature of the material is part of the breeding of this creature. At the same time the rough slabby surface is the product of the technique used but also suggests the impregnable skin of some armoured, predatory being. The whole sculpture demonstrates the mingling of attributes referred to at the beginning: part bird, part man, part metal, part clay, which add up to an impressive symbol of aggression. DOUGLAS HALL A third work acquired by the same gallery is La Pacho- lette, 1966, by Cesar (b. 92I), bronze sculpture, 34 in. high. (Fig.82). The French sculptor Cesar (full name C6sar Baldaccini) was born in Marseilles in 1921. His earliest original contribution to modern sculpture was in the use of welded steel and in fabri- cating sculpture from scrap, in which he was one of the best of an international group of sculptors who exploited the ideas in this medium so brilliantly thrown off by Picasso and Gonzalez. The earlier, openwork fabrications of C6sar had the sharp, menacing character typical of advanced sculpture in the late forties and early fifties, but later this was replaced by bulbous, continuous surfaces which nevertheless were still fabricated with small pieces and apparently eroded into holes by some outside agency. This latter technique resulted in the stark, suffering but forceful aspect of certain torsos and figures. As his technical resources increased Cfsar began to make skeletal wing-like structures covered with thin plates, which might be polished, somewhat like the membrane of a bat's wing. This was his special version of the fashionable biomorphism of the fifties. La Pacholette (the word is dialect and not to be found in standard French dictionaries) is a part of that development. The rough, swollen, warty body of the bird with great encrusted feet recalls the primitive-looking torsos already mentioned, especially those female torsos which have the force ofpre-historic fertility symbols. It contrasts sharply with the sophisticated polish of the plumage although this too is ragged-edged. The result is a rather disturbing image: the sheer prodigality with which bronze is used gives this big sculpture a presence and a luxurious aspect oddly at variance with the ugliness and perhaps the hidden cruelty of the subject. DOUGLAS HALL (Reprinted from the National Galleries of Scotland Bulletin [1970o], No.I). 560</page><page sequence="3">A further work for the Scottish National Gallery is Epstein's The Risen Christ (Fig.83), a unique bronze of 1919. Height, 2- 8 m. (86 in.) This major work by Epstein now stands in the south-east corner of the lawn in front of Inverleith House. It was begun about 1918 and first exhibited in February 1920. As so often in Epstein's career, this work offended the sensibilities and prejudices of many people - necessarily so, because Epstein did not treat neutral or purely formal subjects but was primarily interested in touching the nerves controlling human and social behaviour and laying sacrilegious hands, so it might have seemed at the time, on cherished symbols. In the case of this work, its character of a Jewish Christ was enough to ensure a stormy reception. It must also be acknowledged that Epstein's Risen Christ is in some ways an imperfect work. Formal perfection of the kind sought by such sculptors as Arp or Brancusi is almost never to be found in Epstein's work, which overrides the absence of this quality by its forcefulness. The tension and contradiction that can be felt in the Christ arise from the original conception of the work, which consists of three elements - a portrait head, hands and feet of a symbolically exaggerated naturalism, all grafted to a trunk which is by Epstein's standards relatively formalist and decorative. The sequence was that in 1917 Epstein made a head of his friend the composer Bernard van Dieren, whom he had earlier sculpted as a robust, handsome young man but who was now wasted by sickness. Epstein thought that this head had the nobility of the suffering Christ - the public were not to agree with him - and added the arms and hands and upper part of the torso. Later the body was added, and the work completed after the interval of a year. The true simplicity and furious enthusiasm of Epstein provide the fire that fuses the parts of the Christ together in spite of the difficulties. It emerges as a work of naked feeling, unprotected by any assumed graces or conventions. DOUGLAS HALL (Reprinted from the National Galleries of Scotland Bulletin [1969], No.2) The Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool has acquired the Woman with Mandoline by Henri Laurens (1885-1954) (Fig.84). This terra-cotta is one of an edition of 6 cast in 1957 by Jan Van Dongen. The Epreuve 0 is in the Donation Laurens at the Mus6e National d'Art Moderne, Paris. The original plaster of 1919 derives from a wooden cubist sculpture of that year (ill. MARTHE LAURENS: Henri Laurens, sculpteur [1955], plate V, p.75 there entitled Joueuse de Guitare). Laurens met Braque in 191 and certainly knew Picasso by 1915-1916. Braque introduced Laurens, already a sculptor dissatisfied with Rodin, to Cubism. Although Cubist painting was fundamentally sculptural in the sense that it aimed at representing on a two-dimensional canvas a multi-dimensional space it was the later 'flatter' constructions of Picasso, Braque and Laurens him- self that led the way to the Cubist sculpture of Laurens. The Woman with Mandoline has the usual sharp surface facetting, the reversal of convex and concave forms and of solid and void, the breaking down of forms generally. Cubism, emphasizing the problem of expressing the real structure of an object in space in two dimensions, scarcely 'applied' to sculpture and possibly for this reason Laurens's Cubist sculpture, concentrating on the more obvious aspects of the movement, was replaced around I921 by broader, more monumental and curvilinear forms to- gether with a more representational approach. EDWARD S. MORRIS Keeper of Foreign Art The Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art has also acquired Seated Figure, 1916 or I917 (original stone), by Jacques Lipchitz, bronze, 29j in. high (Fig.85). Jacques Lipchitz was born as Chaim Lipschitz in Druskeniki in Lithuania in 19go0. He came to Paris in i909 and lived there as his home from 1913 to 1940. Escaping to unoccupied France in 1940, he was one of those Jewish artists whose rescue was a high priority for the Americans working in this field, and he arrived in New York in 1941. After the war he decided to settle for good in America. Lipchitz's involvement with Cubism proper lasted for only a few years, from 1914 to 1919, and in later years he tended to play it down, referring to 'a brief few years when I limited the field of my adventuring because I sought what I thought I should, rather than responding freely with my whole being to the world around me.' Like Laurens, Lipchitz had to find ways out of Cubism in the twenties, but in 1922 it could still be said of him: 'his art is objective and self-sufficient ... It is characterized by ... the cubic element.' These statements are very contrary to his later work and beliefs. Viewed against the fertile, inventive modelling of his work as a whole, his cubist period does smack of constraint. Lipchitz's natural material is an abundant, richly modelled clay which translates magnificently into bronze, but at this time he set himself to carve stone, as in the original version of this piece, now in the National Gallery of Canada. Constraint or not, Lipchitz made a serious effort to create a Cubist sculpture, probably the most serious of any artist, since Picasso's efforts in this direction were nearly all constructions or assemblages. With the piece under discussion in mind, the question must be asked: was Lipchitz successful in creating a Cubist sculpture, or is such a thing impossible? Cubist painting is really an illusionist form of art and depends on the ability of painting to reconcile illogical appearances. Only constructions could convey much of the interpenetrating planes of Cubism in three dimensions. Picasso's greatest sculpture, the Woman's Head of 1909, represents only the initial phase of Cubism. Solid sculpture defies the transparency which classical Cubism aimed at. On the other hand the Lipchitz has a great deal in common with the last phase of Cubism when it aimed at simplicity, placing shapes side by side instead of making them interpenetrate. Nevertheless although the Seated Figure is only partially successful considered as Cubism, its effect, although massive, is not merely monolithic. Within the overall mass there are planes which echo each other and can be imagined (though with some effort) to continue under the surface and intersect the mass. Certainly these planes set up a very solid and satisfying balance of directions. The spine of the figure is a high upright block, which may represent the back of a chair, intersected (as above) by planes and rounded forms which represent the shoulders, arms and knees of a person seated in it in an upright, foreshortened position. But the figure does not yield easily to analysis of this sort and it must be allowed that Lipchitz was more interested in the archi- tecture of his figure than in making a logical Cubist interpretation of it. DOUGLAS HALL A further work for the Scottish National Gallery is Femme debout a la draperie au bras levJ, 1928, by Henri Laurens, bronze, I5 in high (Fig.86) Henri Laurens was an essentially modest sculptor whose work is not so well known in this country as it should be. His career has parallels with that of Lipchitz and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art is fortunate in possessing a work of each, represent- 56I</page><page sequence="4">ing two radically different periods. These two artists, together with Zadkine who is already represented in the collection, formed the central core of professional sculptors in the School of Paris of Picasso's generation. Both Laurens and Lipchitz were early adherents of Cubism and both found it eventually impossible to reconcile with their sculptural drives. Only Zadkine retained something of Cubism to the end of his life. Laurens's departure from Cubism followed approximately the same course as Picasso's but was characteris- tically gentler. Moreover Laurens as a sculptor would have found the transition easier than Picasso as a painter, because there were precedents in sculpture for what he was aiming at, especially in the work of Maillol. The early 1920's saw an evident desire on the part of some leading artists of the School of Paris to return to sculptural simplicity after the complexities of Cubism, and to a more relaxed atmosphere after the acerbities of the revolutionary years. Cubism itself could be taken as no more than a kind of simplifica- tion and it was on this interpretation that it contributed so much to the 'modern style' of the twenties. Laurens's first post-Cubist works were all of female nudes which were treated at first in a facetted manner, but by 1928, the date of this piece, had become more naturalistic and established a particular feminine type, with wide hips, a long cylindrical torso and small high breasts. This figure, massive, primitive, suggestive of unaroused sensuality, lasted until it was displaced by a far more voluptuous type in the thirties. The Femme debout a la draperie au bras levi is one of the most slender, elegant and perhaps naturalistic of these pieces. The clay has been modelled throughout and nowhere cut with a knife to produce a hard cubistic edge. The face has all its features. In spite of this the effect of Cubism can, of course, be seen in the way the body divides easily into distinct, fairly simple forms. A cast of this sculpture was among those presented by the son of Henri Laurens, in pursuance of his father's wishes, to the Musees Nationaux de France, which will eventually be displayed in a special room at the Mus6e National d'Art Moderne. DOUGLAS HALL Richard Hunt - Fragmented Figure Construction. Welded steel. 1963. Height: 561 in. Richard Hunt acknowledges his debt to Julio Gonzalez so far as techniques of welding metal and some formal ideas are concerned. The rest of us acknowledge our debt to Richard Hunt for carrying the methods and conceptions of Gonzalez beyond the point at which he found them. Hunt, just thirty-five years old, has already created a large body of work ranging from abstract welded metal sculpture to works which combine metal with other materials. They are sometimes based on biomorphic forms suggesting insect or sea life and sometimes are outright anthropomorphic images such as Fragmented Figure Construction acquired by The Cleveland Museum of Art in I969 as a most welcome gift from Arnold H. Maremont (Fig.88) The figurative aspect of this work reminds one of Gonzalez's famous Montserrat. However, the Spanish master's work is more realistically representational than Hunt's. It is the product of an age when it was easier to view the figure whole, psychologically and morally, The simple, monumental female figure stands upright, protectively holding an infant in one arm with a sickle held challengingly in her other hand. Her upturned face echoes the suggestion of fear coupled with defiance. In I937 the issues of good and evil seemed relatively clear. Hunt's figure reveals a later vision, one which suggests the anguish inspired by a multi-facetted struggle in which few issues are clear cut. It is twisted, torn, ripped, pitiful, and at the same time monstrous. The Montserrat's upright stance suggesting ethical conviction is replaced by a tortured attitude and physically deformed figure suggesting bewilderment, fear, and menace. Most disconcerting is a small accretion, with a blank staring eye, seeming to creep over the top of what at first appears to be a headless torso. The image suggests most disconcertingly the monstrous mutation (psychological as well as physical) that may well be man's fate. Thus, Hunt displays technical skill, formal excellence, and a sensitivity to the contemporary human condition which perhaps could only be experienced and expressed so cogently and precisely by an artist who is American and black. EDWARD B. HENNING Curator of Contemporary Art The Cleveland Museum of Art. Robert Jacobsen's The Cruel Song is a recent acquisition by the Nasjonalgalleriet, Oslo. (Fig.87) Jacobsen was born in Copenhagen in June, 1912, and as an artist he was self-taught. During the 1930s, he was impressed by the work of artists such as Gabo, Pevsner and Arp, and he began his career by making abstract sculptures in wood. It was not until about 1940 that he began working in stone. In 1947, he settled in France. From then on he was to prefer working in metal, especially iron, in an abstract style. In a number of smaller works, however, he has exploited a more directly expressive style in a series of grotesque, often satirical, figures and groups. A small series of bronzes - to which The Cruel Song belongs - executed in 1968 and 1969 was inspired by the invasion of Czechoslovakia in August, 1968. Close by the Two-piece sculpture of 1966, by Henry Moore, in the Calouste Gulbenkian Room, the Whitworth Art Gallery's more recent acquisition, Barbara Hepworth's Sphere with inner form, 1963, is a tough and massive presence (Fig.89). It has a less immediate refinement than the Moore. The complexity of forms and voids is at once apparent, but the subtlety of their disposition is evident only after exploration. Both forms are of recognizable families in the artist's work: a sphere deeply hollowed out in three places to form an inner chamber, in which rests an irregular shape, with concave faces, and itself pierced. Familiar too are the inner and outer surfaces distinct in colour and texture: what is smooth and darkly reflecting on the surface becomes deeply scored, as if rough hewn, inside, and with a dense grey-green patina. The inner form itself is once more smooth, but unlike its exterior counterpart bears a patina. Two of the large apertures are irregular, cutting into the sphere obliquely, and their massive side walls curve inwards to form a vaulted floor. This produces a rhythm of curved surfaces which enclose the inner bronze, and the openings themselves bring subtle irregularities to the silhouette of the sphere. Exploration is perhaps the apt term, since from many viewpoints the work is as secretive as a sea cave. Only from one angle does the sculpture open out. Here the interior and exterior surfaces meet at the narrow rim of a circular aperture. The silhouette is here perfectly regular, and the inner form is in full view. But this is not a complete discovery, for the smaller bronze is pierced on a different axis, and even an oblique view through this inner void is obscured by the wall of the sphere behind. 562</page><page sequence="5">The sculpture was purchased in 1968 with the aid of grants from the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, the Victoria and Albert Museum Grant Fund, the Friends of the Whitworth, the Leonard Cohen Fund, and an anonymous donor. DAVID JOLLEY Assistant Keeper Presented to the Walker Art Gallery by the Contemporary Art Society in 1968, Ball of Nails, 1966 (Fig.9o), is one of a series of Balls of Nails, begun by Uecker in 1959. This includes Gliding Glide (1959), in the Busch Reisinger Museum, Cambridge, Mass., and Grosse Spirale, 1967, in the Dublin Municipal Art Gallery. The importance of the series is in the articulation of light, space and implied movement using commonplace preformed materials, in this case nails and canvas. These are elevated above possible objet trouvi connotations by the whole being painted white which emphasizes the aesthetic intentions and allows them to operate, but they do retain a familiarity which deliber- ately opposes Fine Art-Life distinctions and makes the sculpture work on a very human level. Space, light and movement are characteristic concerns of the Zero group of which Uecker has been a member since 1958, together with Otto Peine and Heinz Mack. Influenced by the Kinetic artists, J. R. Soto in particular, the group explored the use of light on reliefs textured so as to appear to vibrate as the spectator moved. Like Soto they soon transferred from the wall to the floor space, eventually creating environments of light and visual movement as a more direct way of involving their audience and the logical extension of their medium. This development can be seen in Uecker, starting with the nail wall reliefs, working through free standing sculpture to the Lightplantage (1966) at the Stedeliyk Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven'; a space 3 by 3 by 3m filled with vertical highly polished rods and lights. However, obviously each stage is not chronologically watertight. Ball of Nails, 1966, can be seen as an intermediate work between spectator isolation and spatial involvement. It has a fiercely tactile and physical presence due to its size (58 cm) and texture, which counter-balances the purely visual qualities and tensions. The sphere is never static except at the solid white core. Around this the nail heads visually describe two circles, the inner denser one of shorter nails revolves slowly, whilst the open work perimeter flickers rapidly around the axis. The ball is at once contained and delineated by the apparent circum- ference and is in fact a spherical core extended out into space by a system of spokes. This is an extremely complex and poetic work, which challenges and explores our optical assumptions. The arrested light and movement of a photograph necessarily tend to destroy these qualities and to depict a blown up pin cushion. It is by comparison that the subtlety of Uecker's achievement can be appreciated. GAIL P.D. ENGERT Assistant Keeper of British Art Among modern sculpture recently acquired by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston are examples of Calder and Smith. Alexander Calder's The Onion (Fig.9i), a fine specimen of his use of abstract shapes to suggest actual objects, is made of black- painted steel. It is signed and dated 1965 and is 72 by 72 ins. It is part of the intended gift of Susan Morse Hilles. David Smith's Zig VIII (Fig.92) is signed and dated I-15-65; and measures 8ft 4) ins in height; 7ft 71 ins in width; and 6ft II ins in depth. It is the last of the Zig series of 1961-1964. David Smith chose the title Zig for these constructions for two reasons: figura- tively, because several of them incorporate zig-zag elements; literally, because the name is an abbreviation of ziggurat, the temple tower of the Chaldeans and Babylonians. See CLEVE GRAY; David Smith by David Smith, N.Y. [1968], pp. 18 f.; EDWARD F. FRY: David Smith, Guggenheim Museum, N.Y. [1969], pp. 136f., fig. 83. Bought by the Leeds Art Collections Fund with the aid of a grant from Yorkshire Television, for the City Art Gallery, Leeds, is Series A, No.2 by William Tucker (Fig.93), fibreglass, 33 by 90 by 83 inches. William Tucker, who was born in I935, read history at Oxford before going to London to study sculpture at the Central School, and at St Martin's School of Art, where he has also taught. For the past two years he has been Gregory Fellow in Sculpture at the University of Leeds. Series A, No.2 was shown last November in an exhibition at the Gallery of work by the current holders of the Fellowships in Painting and Sculpture and acquired for the Gallery at the close of the exhibition. This exhibition included work from the early 1960's up till October 1969 and demonstrated clearly Tuckers' preoccupation with constructed sculpture, which he has defined as 'the fixing and joining of preformed parts . . . the focus is not at the centre, as with carving and modelling, but at the joints'.2 In Tucker's own work 'joints' also means junctions - places where the components of the work touch, though they may not be actually fixed. A sculpture may consist of a number of similar units which become sculpture by being arranged in a particular way, with the implication that they could be rearran- ged in some other way to make a new sculpture. This in fact happened with the Series A sculptures, all four of which consisted of similar pairs of H-shaped units, but joined in different ways to make four different sculptures. All four were shown together at the Kasmin Gallery early in 1969. M.S.C. 'Crash' 1964 by Eduardo Paolozzi (Fig.94) welded aluminium, 94 by 59 by 36 ins. has been acquired by the Ulster Museum, Belfast. This was the first example of Paolozzi's work to be acquired for the Ulster Museum's collection of contemporary art. Since then a print in the Theory of Relativity series has been added. Crash has been exhibited a number of times and is to be included in the forthcoming Paolozzi Retrospective at the Tate; it was first shown at the Hatton Gallery, University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in I964 and then at the Robert Frazer Gallery in the same year. In 1967 it was included in the Paolozzi Exhibition at the Kr611er- Miller Museum, Otterloo, and was subsequently shown at the Hanover Gallery, from which the piece was purchased by the Museum. Crash was discussed and illustrated in an article on Eduardo Paolozzi by JASIA REICHARDT in Studio International [October, 19641], and has been included, and illustrated in the following publica- tions: Eduardo Paolozzi by UWE M. SCHNEEDE, Thames and Hudson; Eduardo Paolozzi by DIANE KIRKPATRICK, Studio Vista Publications (forthcoming). At first sight Crash has a harsh, even strident effect. It is a mass of writhing forms which seem to fly apart but remain contained within the whole, held together as if by centrifugal force. In the centre there is a cast of a wheel which occurs in several of Paolozzi's sculptures of this period, but in this case part of the rim has been torn off and the wheel set at a tilted 1 Illus. Documenta 4, International Exh.

This is a transitional piece in which the familiar industrial scrap of Paolozzi's 'new style' is no longer arranged in formal patterns, but instead is composed in irregular groupings in which the total mass is more important than the constituent parts. At the same time the individual shapes are so attractive and so strong that they almost dominate the form achieving the nice balance between the two which makes this piece so very exciting. J. W. FORD SMITH As a gift of the Brown Foundation, The Museum of Fine Arts at Houston in Texas has received Louise Nevelson's Mirror Image I (Fig.95). Like so many of her works, it is made of black painted wood and is conceived on a large scale, measuring SI17 inches in height, 21 o inches in width and21 inches in depth. The gift of this recent work, which dates from 1969, is appropriate since the museum mounted an important exhibition of Miss Nevelson's work in the autumn of last year. Boat Frieze (1939) by Sigurd Winge, made of copper, wood, stone and glass, of which we reproduce a detail (Fig.96) has been acquired by the Nasjonalgalleriet, Oslo, in 1969. Sigurd Winge was born I4th March, i909, and died 22nd January, 1970. He was a disciple of the Oslo Academy of Art 1930-32. When the German artist Rolf Nesch came to Oslo in 1933, Winge was strongly impressed by his expressionistic works and by his prints, and from then on he started working in the same field, with mosaics in glass, stone, wood, terra-cotta, and different metals. His first great work in this technique was this decorative frieze, The Boat Frieze, executed for the Norwegian pavilion at the New York World Fair 1939 and inspired by the fishing fleet off the Norwegian coast, a motif also treated by Rolf Nesch. After the war Winge mostly occupied himself with exten- sive room decorations, among which must be noted the frieze (in differently shaded terra-cotta) in the the Oslo Commercial School (1948-56), and the stone mosaic Resurrection in the Oslo Eastern Crematorium (I957-68). The Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, has acquired Table amoncellante (1968) by Jean Dubuffet, in painted polyester (Fig. 97). Dubuffet may be considered as one of the Specialitis de la Maison of the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam. In the collection there are thirteen works by him, of which five have been given by the artist after his retrospective exhibition in the Stedelijk, in 1966. The Table amoncellante, acquired in 1969, is the most recent work in this series. The Table forms a spatial continuation of the l'Hourloupe paintings, of which the museum possesses four works, i.a. Le Cosmopolite (1963) and l'Escampette (I964). The work consists of many loose polyester parts, literally piled up. It is painted in the l'Hourloupe colours: red, blue and white. Though painting is emphasized in the collection of the Stede- lijk Museum, a number of important sculptors are represented. One of them is the Dutchman, Wessel Couzijn (born I912, works in Amsterdam), by whom the Museum possesses a number of works. It acquired The Bed (1967) in I969 (Fig.98). Under this neutral title Couzijn gives a touching picture of upheaval and destruction. On top of and through the iron double-bed, forms are placed, cast in bronze, which are partly welded together. Over a bronze skin - with an expressively worked surface - a green patina is laid. Ever since 1964, Couzijn has been'integrating' ready made objects in his work, such as beds, tables, chairs and stoves. Recently his forms have become firmer, and at the moment he works in stainless steel. Ceroli's figures are sawn out of unplaned wood and appear mainly as silhouettes. However, in most cases they are in no way limited to a single surface. In Seated Man donated by Mrs Fainn Schniewind in 1969 to the Von der Heydt Museum, Wuppertal (Fig.99, Ioo) additional pieces of wood are fixed to both sides of the figure's outline, representing details of clothing such as collar, jacket, and trouser folds. The profile is hinged to the back of the head, and when placed in an oblique position contributes towards spatial differentiation of the figure. The well established tradition of presenting a form by its surface lines (as a simple line drawing or a cut-out) is filled with new life by Ceroli. With the profile alone, in a single layer of wood, whose thin edges catch the light, he manages to suggest the third dimension. The works of the American artist George Segal (born I924) are often regarded as Pop Art, but more carefully considered, they appear to be essentially outside this sphere. One example is a recent acquisition by the Van der Heydt Museum, Wuppertal, Ruth in the Kitchen (1964), a plaster figure, with a round table, a back and two cushions (Fig.Io02). While painters such as Lichtenstein, Rosenquist and Warhol reflect the world of mass communications media in place of tangible reality, and a sculptor such as Oldenbourg looks for his subjects chiefly among ready-made, standard products of civilisation, Segal continuously inclines towards a concrete human situation. His realism shows itself also in the use of utensils, objects of equipment, and frag- ments of architecture, which he takes from his surroundings and at times puts together to build a whole scene. One or more figures are then placed in position, which have been moulded from plaster casts of living humans. Segal fashions them in life- like pose and expression, but avoids conveying the usual wax- work illusion, partly by smoothing out the rough surfaces and by naturalistic painting. The ghost-like figures stand in strangely moving contrast to the material objects around them, which is experienced by the viewer as an expression of man, alienated, and unfamiliar with his own world. The Friends of the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery purchased Kenneth Hughes's The Well-Made Play (1969) from the artist's one-man exhibition at the Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, held last October (Fig.IoI). The Gulbenkian Foundation made a grant towards the acquisition under the terms of its Provincial Galleries Sculpture Purchase Scheme. Kenneth Hughes (born 1927) has written of this sculpture that it 'began with a number of images some of which were absorbed, some rejected - incidents in Ibsen, particularly John Gabriel Borkmann, the figure silhouetted against tall windows. Victorian painting (the woman in The Awakening Conscience). This material had to be resolved formally - it almost amounts to building obstacles and making sculpture which tries to overcome them. I made several versions of the figures before deciding to use machined (turned) shapes from measured working drawings and this scheme seemed consistent formally. The matt red [of the background] created an oppressive mood and the parts were seen as shapes before their identity became apparent . . . The title refers to 'well-made' in dramatic criticism not to my woodwork.' Other echoes besides Holman Hunt's well-known painting are evoked by Hughes's sculpture which, with its emphasis on marital discord in a bourgeois setting, recalls Orchardson's Mariage de Convenance, or an episode from Galsworthy's Forsyte Saga. However, the formal structure of the work successfully conveys the intended mood on its own terms and quite indepen- dently of literary associations, though a knowledge of these adds piquancy to our enjoyment of it.
