<plain_text><page sequence="1">Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona VOL. XII ] OCTOBER 1930 [ PART I FORMS OF GOVERNMENT IN ANCIENT INDIA BY DR. R. SHAM8HASTRI, B. A., Ph. D. We have seenjhow the snoient Indians had enjoyed freedom of thought and aotion both on social and religious matters and how the V&amp;naprasthas were as free as the air they inhaled and the water they drank in the settlements made on the banks of rivers in the midst of forests. As the four classes into which they were divided had been free to intermarry and interdine with each other, it goes without saying that they had no communal divi- sions and formed a united body politic. It is probable that the V&amp;naprastha order of life was not fully developed during the Vedic period and that during the Upanisad period it had its full development and made its power felt by the kings. Being an important branch of the Indo-European race, they must have carried with them the tradition and practice of self-government to India. Accustomed as they had been to the free political institutions of their ancestors, there is reason to believe that they continued to have the same form of government in their migra- tion. Besides, their anxiety was rather to defend themselves and their new settlement against the Dasyus than to reoast their traditional form of government. The study of the Vedas in the light thrown by the anthropomorphology of the Vedic Indians goes to show that they had no monarchical institutions* During the early days of the Vedic period they seem to have regulated the affairs of the settlement by an assembly of the people called</page><page sequence="2">2 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute Samiti. Apart from a military class of people called Ksatra and leaders or generals called Rãjãnah ( in plural ) to carry out their schemes of conquest they seem to have devised no heriditary monarchical institution. This view is supported by the anthropo- morphic features of Indra's rule and the co-operative support which the other gods gave to Indra in his work. Like the Vedic people the gods are also classed as Brãhmans, Ksatriyas and Vaisyas. Indra, the Ãdityas,' and the Rudras who are all fierce in their nature are Ksatriays. Brhaspati, Sukra and others are Brãhmans. The Maruts are the Vaisyas, inasmuch as they carry the wealth-giving rain from place to place and make the whole of the land receive its due share of rainfall. They all stand equal to each other, though during the time of war Indra heads them. Indra takes the first rank and is called a ruleT in virtue of the merit he has achieved by performing a hundred sacrifices. He holds his position so long as he maintains his conduct and character. He has his own enemies and rivals. Whoever among men performs a hundred sacrifices ( Satakratu) or penance equivalent to it is considered to be fully qualified to oust Indra and occupy his throne. The Daityas, the sons of Diti, his step-mother, are his born enemies and ever watching for an opportunity to seize his throne and rule over the gods. Thus Indra is in constant fear both from men and demons and is obliged to be very careful in the exercise of his power both over gods and sages. With a view to thwart men and demons from their ambitious aim at seizing his throne by performing a hundred sacrifices or penance, he sends beauti- ful celestial nymphs to divert them from virtue to sin. But the unique power he wields over men, gods and demons sometimes, turns him giddy and makes him unconscious of its limita- tions. Once he is said to have treated Brhaspati, his trusted minister, with contempt and consequently lost his throne. On another occasion, a sage called Durvãsas possessing th© power of curse meets him while he was going on in procession mount- ed on his white elephant called Air ã v ata and presents him with a garland of flowers. He receives the garland and carelessly puts it on the head of the elephant. As usual with animals, the elephant catches hold of it with its trunk and casting it under</page><page sequence="3">Forms of Government in Ancient India 3 its leg crushes it. The sage becomes enraged at the contempt with which Indra has treated the garland presented to him as a mark of respect and favour. He at onoe curses him to lose his power and render his throne vacant. On this occasion there was only one individual among men, Nahusa by name, who had quali- fied himself for the throne by performing a hundred sacrifices. With the unanimous consent of gods and m en he goes to the [heavenly world and ascends the throne. But the exalted position to which he has risen by the sheer force of his sacrificial merit turns him giddy and makes him lose all sense of moral propriety. He goes so far as to think that he has a claim to Saci, the queen of the dethroned god, Indra. In reply to his call, the queen makes use of an artifice and asks him to come to her palace borne on a palanquin by the seven sages. As anticipated by her, Nahusa urges the palanquin bearers to hurry on saying " Sarpa, sarpa . " " run quickly, run quickly n. Agastya, one of the seven sages bearing the conveyance and a little shorter and older than the others, becomes enraged at Nahusa's insulting words and curses him saying " Sarpo bhava " become a snake Nahusa at once falls down from heaven, becoming a snake. At his im- mediate request, and prayer for mercy, the sage forgives him by putting a limit to the duration of his curse. He says that after he meets and carries on conversation on the question of Dharma and Adharma with Yudhisthira, a lineal descendant of his own lunar dynasty, he will regain his original form and return to the heaven. There is however no reference to this story in the Vedas. There is an allusion to Nahusa's hundred sacrifices in the Brhad- devatä. Nevertheless the incidents of the Purãnic story cannot be said to belong to the age of the Puränas when heriditary in- stead of elective monarchy prevailed throughout India. The implications of the story are however the characteristics of a period when elective monarchy was prevalent. Correspond- ing to the Polytheistic form of the Vedic religion especially to its henotheistic aspect, in which prominence was given to particular deity in accordance with the power ascribed to him, the election of a man to power depended on the capacity he had to discharge</page><page sequence="4">4 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute the duty of the position. Corresponding to the class of warlike gods there was the class of the Ksatriyas or rãjãs whose duty it was to defend the homes and hearth of the Aryans against their enemies, the Dasyus. The Ksatriyas were all called Räjans and the elected leader or chief of them seems to 'have been variously called Adhirãja, Sãmrãj, or Svarãj aooording to the nature of the power exercised by him. The Aitareya Brãhmana ( 1. 14 ) 6peaks of a period when the Äryans bad no king to lead them to a war against the Asuras and placed themselves under king Soma. The passage runs as follows: - " The Devas said ; it is on acoount of our having no king that the Asuras defeat us. Let us elect a king. All consented. They elected Soma their king. Headed by king Soma, they were victorious in all directions. " The use of word ' Rãja ' in the sense of a Ksatriya or soldier is borne out by the following passages of the ßgveda : - " Where a Brähman meets with herbs like räjans in an assembly, he is called a physician, fiend-slayer and ohaser of disease. " ( X. 97, 6 ). " Let us with our Räjans win victories and obtain wealth in battles. "(X. 42, 10). There cannot possibly be many kings attending an assembly of people. Hence the word Rãjãnah seems to mean soldiers or generals. In the Atharva Veda the word Rãja is used in various connections and it cnnnot appropriately be interpreted to mean a king. The phrase " Sajãta r&amp;jãnah '' in the following passage means fellow soldiers, but not fellow-kings. " Seize, Agni, on thy power and firmly hold it ; contend thou with the friend by way of friendship. Placed in the centre of fellow-räjans, Agni, flash forth, frequently invoked here. " ( A. V. II. 6, 4 ). Again in the following Vedic passage the word means soldiers or generals : - " Make me beloved among the gods, beloved among the räjans, make me dear to every one who sees, and to Südra and to Aryan man. " ( A. V. XIX. 62, 1 ).</page><page sequence="5">Forms of Government in Ancient India 8 " Bestow splendour on our Brãhmans ; bestow splendour on our Räjans ; bestow splendour on our Vaisyas and Südras and bestow splendour over splendour on me. " (Tait. S. V. 7, 6, 4 &amp; Vãj. S. 18, 48 ). In Rg. X. 173 the poet prays for the safety and security of a king ohosen for the time. Another poet prays in- A. V. VI. 88, for faithfulness and loyalty of the state assembly to the eleoted king. The Atharva Veda VI. 134 contains imprecating verses cursing a tyrant and praying for his downfall. In A. V. III. 3 a poet prays for the return of a banished king and his restoration to power. The Taittirlya Samhitä ( II. 3, 1 ) records a rite and prayer for the confirmation in power of an elected king and for the defeat of his rival. In A. V. III. 5, 8 ; VI. 73, 1, 2, 3 ; VI. 94 ; YI1. 35 ; and XIX. 37 it is clearly stated that the troubles of an eleoted monarch were due to charriot-makers, artisans, troop-leaders, masters of the horse, the electors or king-makers, his kinsmen, and lastly the people at large. In none of the hymns mention is made of troubles due to sons and wives, a lurking domestio danger as set forth in the Arthaáãstra of Kautilya. This state of things is in keeping with the inference that can be legitimately drawn from the anthropomorphic features of Indra's rule over gods and men. The tale narrated by the authors of the Purãnas of Indra's rule is evidently a reflection of what had oocurred among themselves on earth. The one vulnerable point in the mentality of ancient Indian writers is its tendenoy to belittle humanity and regard its volitions, emotions and activities as whimsical and as deserving of no notice. To them all subjective phenomena appeared to be no less chaotic and disorderly than the objective phenomena. The working of the human mind was quixatic. They could discover no law and order in its activities. It was a wild elephant in rut and no restraint was strong enough to keep it under control. Mind is common to all and ever goeB astray, no matter whether it is of a sage, a king or a peasant or an idiot. History of a nation is nothing but a record of the activities of the national mind and is therefore disorderly. Hence neither an invidual nor a society, is worth of study. This kind of thought seems to have driven the ancient Ipdians to devote their mipd and tongue to talk of gods, goddess-</page><page sequence="6">6 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute es, their worlds, and their activities with no feeling of weariness and disgust. But it seems not to have dawned in their mind that in talking of gods and their institutions they could speak of nothing but their own experience and of their own imaginations. Their experience was entirely human and they could therefore speak of gods in terms human with a little exaggeration here and there. Even now there are poets and composers of songs who consider it sinful to praise even good kings. The late Tyãgarãja, the celebrated music composer of southern India, composed all his original songs in praise of Rama and preferred the life of a beggar to the acquisition of wealth and power by composing songs in praise of kings. In doing this his consolation seems to have been that he had his Rama constantly before his mind and that therefore his life was worth living. It follows therefore that the salient features of Vedic and Puränic myths regarding the political activities of gods are more or less exact copies of political activities of the Aryans of the Vedic period. Considering the anthropomorphic features of Indra's rule we may come to the conclusion that during the Vedic period the ancient Indians lived under an elective monarchy and that they had an assembly of people similar to the Sabhä or assembly of Indra. The duration of the sovereignty of the elected chief depended rather on his charcter and good conduct than on any military power on which he could never rely on account of rivals and factions. The assembly was all-powerful and could impeach, dethrone, and banish a king, just as Indra was impeached, dethroned and banished. All the classes of the people had an equal status in the assembly like the various classes of gods in Indra's assembly. This state of things continued till the period of the Upanisads when Brahma-pantheism was substituted for the polytheism of the Vedic period. The one impersonal power of universal conscious- ness called Brahma ousted the various limited personal gods susceptible of malice, envy, hatred, mutual jealousy and other human frailties. Corresponding to this change in thought there seems to have occurred a change in political thought also. Elective monarchy was replaced by hereditary monarchy. The king was styled a Räjarsi, saintly king, wjiose duty it was to</page><page sequence="7">Forms of Government in Ancient India 7 live a spiritual life and observe the ethical principles of the Upanisads. He has to work with no aspiration for the result of work for his own enjoyment. He has to shun all kinds of voluntary pursuit after objective pleasures. We read in the Upa- nisads of the principles which Janaka and other kings had ob- served in the administration of their kingdoms. On the absolute idealism of the Upanisads are based the principles of morality, and economical and political life of the ancient Indian. There can possibly be no better solution of the hard problem of unequal distribution of wealth than the doctrine of work with no attach- ment to the fruits of action ; nor can there be a better restraint of desire, greed and other passions than control of the will and the senses by Nivrtti or withdrawal from pursuit after objective pleasures of the world. When once the disposal of surplus wealth by performance of sacrifices or by charitable works is brought into practice and when once the mind and the! will are brought under control by the observance of yogic practices, there is neither the likelihood nor the possibility of any economical or political disturbance. The institution of the Yänaprastha order of life was mainly for the promotion of moral, economical, political, intellectual and spiritual ends. No spiritual goal is attained unless moral and other social pursuits are carefully directed so as to be conducive to the attainment of the spiritual goal. In the view of the ancient Indians all human activities are either intellectual or physical, self being a mere witness of those activities. Not knowing the true nature of the self and mistaking intellect or the physical body itself for the self, man is likely to absorb himself either in intellectual or physical activities and thus commit moral, economical and political crimes. With the realisation of the nature of self, on which the conquest of the mind and the will is dependent, there is not the least possibility of man falling into errors. This is the funda- mental principle of Hindu philosophy on which all kinds of sociological theories are based unlike the detached theories expounded by the western scholars to explain the various phases of human life, which is after all an Unit. I cannot therefore agree with Prof. A. B. Keith in saying * That the Upa- nisads do not feel any serious necessity for finding a place for</page><page sequence="8">8 Annoia of the Bhandartcar Oriental Research Institute morality and political life ; while in the west from Hegel onwards heroic , if unsuccessful, efforts have been made by the followers of this ideal to establish morality and civil life as an essential in the absolute. ' The period of the Upanisads may be presumed to lie between B. 0. 2000 and B. 0. 100 according to the late B. G. Tilak and others and B. C. 1000 and B. 0. 100 according to Western scholars. It was a period of peace and intellectual and spiritual activity following on the period of wars and conquest of northern India by the Ãryans. It may be appropriately compared to the peaceful and intellectual activities of the western world in the 19th and the 20th centuries. Corresponding to the Bealists, the Monists, and the Idealists we have in India the Câravãkas, the Aup&amp;sakas and the non-dualists. In a narrow sense the Buddhists and the Jainas may be compared to the followers of agnostioism* While the number of different schools of philoso- phers in that period in the east is as great as that in the west in- the two preceding oenturies and even at the present, the conspicu- ous difference between the worlds is that while the east was earnest in bringing its religious and philosophical precepts into practice as far as possible, the west seems to satisfy itself with the mere exposition of its various philosophical theories. Notwithstanding the absenoe of histories and biographies regarding the saintly life of Indian philosophers and true religi- ous devotees who observed their religious and philosophical precepts to the very letter, there is yet enough of literary re- cords to show that with the ancient Indians there was no wide gulf between religious theories and their practical applications. Confining our attentton to historical personages we cannot fail to admire the self-less activities of Mahävlra during the reign of Srenika in Magadha, the Buddha and his followers in Benares and other parts of Northern India, Cänakya in the court of Candragupta, Upagupta and his followers in the empire of Aioka, Patañjali, the founder of the Yoga philosophy during the reign of Pusya Mitra, the Jaina ascetic P&amp;dalipta and his disciples during the reign of the Sakas, Vasubandhu, the Buddhist teacher, and his followers during the asoendancy of 'the Guptas, Meru-</page><page sequence="9">Porms of Government in Ancient India 9 tuňga, a Jaina ascetic and Bãna and Mayüra, the celebrated Brãhman poet-philosophers, in the court of Harsavardhana, Vidyãnanda, Bhattãkalaxika, Jinasena, and other Jaina teachers, Samkarãcãrya, Sivagnãna Sombandhiar, Vãgíáa, Tlrumangayl- var and other Brahman philosophers expounding the principle of self-denial on the basis of Advaita, Saivism or Vaisnavism in the reign of Srlvallabha in the south, Hemacandra and his colleagues at the court of Kumärapäla in Guzarat, Halãyudha during the reign of the Käkatiyas in Yarãfigul, and Vidyãraçya during the commencement of the empire of Vijaynagar. All these teachers preached in one loud and continuous voice the worthlessness of the physical and the intellectual culture and the paramount importance of self-culture and self- realisation. It is well known to students of Indian history how Upagupta, one of the most distinguished Buddhist teaohers, succeeded in converting Aáoka, the Maurya emperor of India , to Buddhism and in impressing on his mind the laws of Dharma ; and how the emperor realising the truth relinquished the pomp and luxury of his imperial palaoe and found contentment and joy in living like an ascetic in a monas- tery. A perusal of his memorable edits will show how after he embraced Buddhism he found it possible to live in peace and joy and to win the love not only of his subjects, but also of his enemies both within and without his empire. As a Buddhist monk he had no necessity to change his beds at night in order to to safeguard his personal safety from enemies aiming at his life. Nor was there any need for him to increase his army and main* tain it in effioient condition to ensure the safety and security of his empire. All this change for better in his life was due to his relinquishment of his sensual life which was worth more than the revenue of his empire and to his life of self--denial which was far oheaper and more enjoyable than that of a peasant in a hut. Of the life which Cãnakya lived as a Brãhman house-holder when the whole of the empire of Nanda with Candragupta, his nominee, at its bead was at his feet, the author of the Mudrâ- räksasa speaks as follows : - ( III. 15 ) i</page><page sequence="10">IO Annoila of th» Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute "This is the stone'piece to split into small pieces the dried cow- dung balls ( to kindle the sacrificial fire ) this is a heap of kuáa- grass by his baohelor students ; this is his dilapidated hut, the thatched roof of which is bent down by bundles of fire-kindling wooden sticks placed thereon for being dried ( in the sun ). ' The author of the drama was not however a contemporary, of Cãnakya and it is probable that his description of Cãnakya' s life is rather an exaggerationjthan a fact. Still it must be noted that the ideal of life which a house-holder has to live is of the kind which the dramatist has given expression to. A simple selfless life, even in an enviroment of luxury and pomp, is what has been enjoined in the Sütras and Dharmaáãstras. Speaking of his own simple life as a Brahman house-holder Halãyudha says in his Brãhmana Sarvasva as follows t- " In whose house there shine wooden vessels along with golden vessels apart in another corner, there hang garments as white as the moon along with deer's skin apart in another corner; there rises in volume the smoke due to the pouring of oblations into the fire along with the smoke of fragrance apart in some another corner. Thus the fire-ritual together with what may be termed its benefioial results expected after life is simultaneously visible. " The luxury of golden vessels and costly white garments for which Halãyudha seems to have cared a straw are evidently the presentations made by the king under whom he was the ohief judicial officer. This office he seems to have accepted not as a means to earn hoards of wealth, but merely as a social service, the only earthly end of his learning. The other and the only end of his life was self-realisation which he had in view and practice. There can be no doubt that the influence whioh a minister like Cãnakya and a judicial officer like Halãyudha brought to bear upon the life of the kings they served not in their own interests, but in the interest of the kings themselves was for the good of the country at large. Coming to the life of Patañjali and his life-works on Grammar and Yoga philosophy, it is unnecessary to say that he</page><page sequence="11">Forms àf Government in Ancient India 11 benefited by his exemplary life not merely his contemporaries, both kings and people, but also the Indian posterity even to the present day. I have already spoken of the economical motive of Vedic sacrifices. Patañjali's participation in the horse-sacri- fice performed by Pusyamitra, as implied by his statement made in the Mahãbhãsya " we shallj cause Pusyamitra to sacrifice " goes to prove that besides being a Yoga philosopher not caring for sacrifices, he was also for sacrifices as an eoonomioal measure oonducive to spiritual life. It was as binding upon a king as upon his wealthy subjeots to spend the surplus earnings so as to ensure public good. Be- sides the construction of wells, tanks, gardens, roads and other public works, ancient Indian kings undertook the performance of Vedic sacrifices to find an outlet for their surplus revenue. The other source of expenditure is enjoyment or pleasure-seeking pursuits. But instead of mitigating desire for new forms of pleasure, search for pleasure augments it. " Never, " says a Sanskrit adage, " does desire for pleasure subside by enjoyment ; it grows on the other hand stronger and stronger like fire witlji clarified butter poured over it. ' ' Hence the best way of getting rid of surplus wealth is in the view of ancient Indians oharity or saorifice. Following this custom under the advice of Patañ- jali and other saintly persons Pusyamitra performed a horse- sacrifice and disposed of the surplus revenue of his empire. How Kumãrapãla, king of Guzarat, instituted under the advice of Hemacandra a number of hospitals and feeding houses to alleviate the misery of the afflicted and the needy and how under the guidance of Vidyãranya, the kings of Vijayanagara, ^ukka and Harihara spent their state-revenue in the construc- tion of tanks, canals, temples, mathas, agrãhãras and other charitable works is a historical fact too well-known to need a description here. This form of ethico-political teaohings carried on by the Vedantins, the Buddhists and the Jainas terminates about the fourth century A. D. and is followed by what is called Ãgama and Pamcarätra systems of religion and ethics. As already pointed out, this religion is Dravidian in its origin and Aryan in its</page><page sequence="12">12 Annals t&gt;f the Bhandarkar Oriental Besearch Institute development. Having Siva or Visnu as a personal god, it is purely an idolatrous form of worship. In its ethical and philoso- phical aspects it follows the Upanisads. The Brahmasutras treating of the nature of Brahma and of the principles of inter- pretation of the Upanisads are commented upon by Saivites and Vaisnavites substituting Siva or Visnu for Brahma. The political theory based upon this Agamic form of worship is quite different from that based upon the polytheism of the Vedas or the pantheism of the Upanisads. As already pointed out, the king of the Aryans during the Vedic period was more or less a servant of the assembly of the people and had to follow its behests or suffer from banishment. During the period of the Upanisads he had to live the life of a Räjarsi or an ascetic king having his will and senses under his control or had to fall a prey to his enemies. In the Agamic period the king was merely a servant of Siva or Visnu in whose name he had to administer the state. In many native states in southern India it is usual with the kings to wear garments of yellow colour and put on a turban Jof yellow colour while drawing along with his subjects and other people the car of the tutelary deity of their states during the car festival. The king is the chief servant of the temple. In the first DIdhiti of his Rftjadharma Kaustubha, Ananta Deva, son of Khanda Deva, says as follows i - In the Srimadbhägavata the king is said to acquire his right of ownership of lands of all kinds in the state ( Sarvaprakärabhümisvämya ) only in virtue of his having set up idols of gods in a temple. 'He acquires the ownership of all the land in virtue of his setting up idols of gods ; of the three worlds in vii tue of his erecting temple ; of the abode of Brahma in virtue of his making endowments for the worship of gods ; and he will attain equality with me ( god Krsna ) in virtue of his performance of all the three. ' Likewise in the Visnudharmottara " Kings desirous of attaining to heaven should in the Kali age set up cities after erecting temples." Here the word cities implies villages and fortified towns also. The verse quoted from the Bhãgavata lays down that a king who is desirous of acquiring the ownership of cities, towns and the like which he establishes should at first erect temples. Whoever is desirous /of acquiring</page><page sequence="13">Forms of Government in Ancient India 13 such ownership in virtue of his being annointed as a king the erection of temples, palaces, and the like are mentioned first. In the verse of Bhägavata the king is said to acquire ownership of all the land in virtue of setting up of idols of gods and temples. . In this connection there crop up two alternatives : whether the word 'Mahïpala ' in the verse means -a person who is already exercising his royal duties, as stated in the Prima facie view in the Mimãmsã sütras of Jaimini ( II. 3, 3 ) or any other person of the ruling caste, as stated in the conclusion of the commentary on the same sõtras. It cannot be the first meaning, for in that case there is no necessity for the annointment of such a person as a I Ang. Nor is the erection of a temple etc. the duties of a person who is already exercising his royal duties ; for the right to observe such duties is dependent upon his acquisition of that power by buildings etc. Nor can it be the second, i. e. any person of the ruling caste, for in that case the construction of palaces and temples eto. which can be undertaken by any person irrespective of his caste and creed would become a spiritual duty of a Ksatriya. The reply is ' Not so ' for though the erection of palaces and temples in general be undertaken by any man, still the construction of such buildings prior to the work of laying out cities and villages can be regarded as a special duty of a person of Ksatriya caste in view of his acquiring the right of sovereignty. In fact only such a person as is possessed of bravery, martial courage and other manly qualities befitting him to be a capable protector of people is regarded as worthy of being annointed as a king. Hence along with qualities such as bravery, courage and capacity to protect, the construction of temples and other buildings befits a person to be a sovereign. There is no doubt that this new theory of theocratic mo- narchy was propounded and practised in mediaeval India. The existence of a great number of temples in the ruined capital towns of kings in mediaeval India, especially in the Dekhan proves it beyond doubt. One of the most interesting of the funda- mental political principles that deserves our attention here is the question relating to a king 's right of ownership of land and man. This is an important question that has long been exercis~ ing the minds of stategmei* and politicians $11 the world oyey</page><page sequence="14">14 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute and has not yet been definite? settled. The question is whether an emperor or hie feudal chief can justly claim and exercise his right of ownership over the land and men in his state. This has been answered in two different ways. The Mlmãmsakas or the sohool of the Vedic exegetics headed by Jaimini hold that neither an emperor ( Särvabhauman ) nor a feudal chief ( Mãndalika ) is justified in exercising any right of ownership over the state land or his people; whether, father, mother or children or his servants. They say that he is only entitled to a fixed share of revenue in kind in virtue of his protective care and that the land and other natural things of the state are cbmmon to all. This is the conclusion arrived at by Jaimini and his commentators who have discussed the point in all its bearing ( Mi tnãmsã sütras, VI. 7, 2 ). Quite opposed to this is the view held by Kautilya, the author of the Arthasãstra. He says for example, that the king shall exercise his right ¿of ownership with regard to fishing, ferrying and trading in vegetables in reservoirs or lakes ( II. 1 ); that besides collecting revenue, the king shall keep as state mono- poly both mining and oommerce ( II. 12 )¡ and in view of justify« ing the levy of an extra water-tax ( II. 24 ) his commentator Bhattasvãmi, quotes a verse in which the state ownership of land and water is clearly mentioned. The verse runs as follows: - "Those who are well versed in the Sastras admit that the king is the owner of both land and water and that the people can ¡only exercise their right of ownership over all other things except these two. ( P. 144, Eng. Tra. ). The view that is held by the Mlmãmsakas seems to be the view that is still current in the transaction of the villagers in India whenever they sell a pieoe of land, they declare in the bond the transfer of eight kinds of enjoyment, such as (1) nidhi ( treasure-trove ), (2) niksepa ( deposit hidden in the earth ), (3) water, (4) trees, (5) stones, (6) agami, anything that may come in future, (7) samcita, anything that is standing, and (8) Akslna, imperishable. This declaration is evidently opposed to the view held by Kautilya and other later politicians who held that any tyreaçure-trove contained in the earth, any deposit of money and</page><page sequence="15">Forms of Government in Ancient India the like concealed in the earth, the salt and other minerals to- gether with water are what the king alone can justly claim as his property. As the Mîmâmsaka view of land-tenure is in agreement not merely with the history of sooial evolution all the world over, but with the nature of the political constitution which obtained in India during the Yedic and the Brähmanic periods, the historical importance of Jaiminťs view on this question cannot be overvalued. Hence I add here below my own trans- lation of the Sütras of Jaimini together with the commentaries of Pärtha Sãrathy Mišra: - The Sõtras( VI. 7, 2 ) are thus commented upon by Pärtha Sãrathy Misra;- It is delared in the Vedas that in the Vis va jit sacrifice the sacrificer makes a gift of all that is his own. There as to the doubt whether even the cognates that are designated by the word ' Sva, ' 4 one's own, * are to be given over or only such wealth as he can claim to be his own, it may be asserted that in the absence of particularisation, all that is implied by the word 'Sva* one's own should be given over ; for it is possible to render father and others subservient to others; the act of bringing a thing under the ownership of another man is what is meant by a gift, hence father and others should also be given over:- But it is not so ; evidently they cannot be given over as a gift, in as much as a gift in the real sense of the word means 'the relin- quishing of one's ownership of a thing and placing it under the ownership of another,-, accordingly (affather cannot be given over) for a father cannot become no-father, though he is given over. But only that which can be called one's own in virtue of his exercis- ing his right of lordship over it can be given over as a gift ; for, when such a thing is gifted, the giver gets rid of his owner- ship and the donee acquires it. Also the word ' sva, ' one's own, means in virtue of its diverse significant power ' self ', 'one's own, 9 4 cognates ' and 4 wealth ' Of these several meanings, it means a single particular meaning in a patrticular context. Since among the meanings, it is only the wealth that forms a</page><page sequence="16">16 Annals of the Btiandarkar Oriental Research Institute proper article of gift, the word 4 sva 9 is here used only in that sense. Hence only wealth, but not father and others. As to the question whether that which is the broad earth should be gifted or not the holder of the prima facie view speaks of it as an article of gift, thinking that it is the wealth of the emperor. But it is no one's property ( sva ). Consisting as it does in the protection of, and the removal of the wicked from, his state, sovereignty ( rãjya ) means the collection of taxes from the agri- culturists and others and of fines from the guilty ( dandya ) ; this much is the relation ( between the king and his state ), but no lordship or ownership ( svãmitã ). Hence no empwor shall make a gift of the broad earth, nor a feudal chief his feudal land. As to the doubt, whether a áüdra who attends upon a master as his servant in view of doing the religious duty should be given over as a gift or not, it may be said that he should be given over, in as much as it is inclusively favoured by the epithet M all " and also it is possible to render him subservient to another. But as there is no master's ownership with reference to him and as there is the possibility of dislike on his part to accept sub- serviency to another, he should not be given over as a gift. In the seventh discourse of his Vivãda-bhangãrnava, Jagan* nãtha Tarkapancãnana agrees with the Mïmârhsakas in the view that the king is no owner of the land and the king is entitled only to certain amount of tax on it, the cultivator of the land being by time-honoured custom its real owner with right of alienation. The context in which he states this view is the sale of the slave girl by one of many brothers, in the house of each of whom she is made to work in turn, as agreed upon during the time of the division of inheritance. The slave woman is com- pared to the land which may change hands by sale. The trans- lation of the text is as follows : - Brhaspati says that a single woman should be made to work in each house ( i, e., the bouse of each of the brothers ) according to the share of the inheritance. Well, there arises a doubt here "vhether the slave woman should or should not go to work on the appointed days in the houses of other brothers, if she is sold to a stranger by one of the brothers on the day when she had to work</page><page sequence="17">t'orras of Government in Ancient India 17 in tins seller's house, we reply thus * the purchaser has acquired the same kind of property right in her that the seller had in her before selling. Hence the purchaser had the right to command her service only for as many days as she attended on her seller by turns in the middle of each month. It is also for this reason that in the kingdom ( country ) purchased by a king, his right of possession of the country extends only to the collection of taxes on it ; and at the same time there remains the right of ownership vested in the cultivator, in virtue of which he is entitled to the produce. Hence also the claim of a cultivator who cultivates a piece of land and enjoys the produce after paying taxes due to the king, to its ownership is admitted on all hands. Hence it is that when the owner of the land sells the land, the purchaser acquires the same right of ownership in virtue of which he is entitled to its enjoyment after paying the taxes due to the king ; aàd that the cultivator's ownership of the land is never denied, as suoh denial is quite opposed to custom ( vyavahära )• Since various kinds of ownership with regard to a single property are accepted, it must be presumed that the claims of two different persons to the same kind of ownership with regard to a property are opposed to each other. Notwithstanding the conflicting views regarding the owner- ship of land, it is a historical fact that in those states in which a theocratic form of government was established with éiva or Visnu as a tutelary deity the whole of the state land is believed to be the property of the temple, the king being regarded as the manager of the property. In Travancore the king is even now regarded as a servant of Padmanãbha, the tutelary deity of the state and is called Padmanãbhad ãsa. The kings of Vijayanagar called themselves servants of Yirupãksa, their family god. The surplus of the state-revenue that remained after administrative and military expenditures are met with, is made use of for reli- gious purposes in connection with the state-temple. The kings of Vijayanagar, the Colas, the Pändyas and the Ceras seem to have spent a major portion of the revenue on temple-worship and on the costly periodical car festivals. Feeding the poor of all castes in the temples seems to have been the duty not only of kings, but also of the wealthy people. Even theft for the purpose of 3</page><page sequence="18">18 Annals of thé Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute feeding the poor in the temple seems to have been considered no punishable crime. One of the sixty three Saivite? saints is said to have been acquitted and permitted to take as much rice as he lfced from the store of grains made in the palace, when brought before the king for punishment for stealing rice from the palace store, be confessed that his theft of rice was for no other purpose than that of feeding the poor devotees in the state temple. Nor there seems to have been any caste distinction either among the early Sai vites or the Vaisna vites. It is believed that the áaivites form a single caste and that the Vaisçavites another caste with no sub-castes or sects among themselves. No dis- tinction other than that of learning and exemplary devotion is ever made among the devotees. The rule of practice observed by them is " To him should be given and from him should be taken," - This is the rule binding upon all the devotees of the same religion, whatever might be their Varna or caste. "Tasmai deyam tato grãhyam trisu varçesvayam vidhih. " The R&amp;mã- nujäcärya's grant of permission to the Ãdikarriatakas of his time to enter into the temple of god Kešava at Belur for worshipping the gods for three days during the annual car festival is an extension of the same principle, i. e., no caste-distinction among the followers of the same religion. This spirit of religious equa- lity seems to have undergone a change for the worse under the lead "of Ve däntadesika during the latter part of the thirteenth century. Before his time the rule of equal treatment of all followers of the same religion quoted above seems to have been applied even to intermarriage and interdining irrespective of caste. Vedãntadesika, however, seems to have restricted the ruje to all other acts of social intercourse except intermarriage and interdining, and thus paved the way for the appearance of rigid caste distinctions among tie followers of the same religion. The réintroduction of such distinctions in social and religious matters between man and man due to birth seems to have given rise to distinctions in political sphere also, and theBr&amp;hmans seem to have claimed and received more social, religious and political Privileg es than others, lhe endowments oí temples and other reli-</page><page sequence="19">Forms of Government in Ancient India 19 gions institutions seems to have been monopolised by tbem and the ruling class for their own material aggrandisement. This is however a selfish turn and abuse of the ancient ethical theory of action with no aspiration for the enjoyment of the results of that action. The later Brãhmans took themselves to temple- worship solely for the material benefits accruing from it. The kings tolerated them, chiefly because they wanted their approval of their own sensual indulgence, as opposed to the saintly life, silf-abnegation ( Rãjarsivrtta ) in acoordanoe with the ethical and spiritual principles of the Upanisads. They became lords of temples instead of temple servants. The revenue of the state went into their palace treasury for the benefit of women and courtiers instead of the temple treasury for the feeding of the poor with no distinction of caste. It is this form of despotism which prevailed throughout India when the British arri ved here. The evils of despotism are rather economic than anarchic. With a view to finance their sensual activities despots are always careful to maintain law and order in their states with as much rigour as possible. It was in their power to introduce such fiscal laws as would fill their treasury. :By the time the Agamic theocratic form of government was established in Indian states, civil and criminal laws were consolidated and regarded as being suscep- tible of no change. They were administered in accordance with the Dharmasästras. Hence fiscal policy was the only factor that was liable to change and disturb the economical equilibrium of the states. There were however three forms of restraints to check the autocracy of the kings : ( 1 ) the Religious ( 2 ) the Ethical and ( 3 ) the Political. The religious restraint of the law of Karma, according to which, any individual, no matter whether he is a prince or a pauper, given to sensual proceedings, is liable to rebirth, and sufferings from the evil consequences of his past Karma. The second is the loss of spiritual bliss due to the violation of the moral law of doing work with no selfish aspira- tion for the fruits thereof. The third is the disaffection and dis- loyalty of the subjects due to unrighteous oppression leading to war and danger to state itself. The first is dependent upon faith and the last two on reason and sound public opinion. A king gjoing against public opinion is adhãrmika since dharma is based</page><page sequence="20">20 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute upon social imperative or command as defined by Jaimini in his Mlmãmsã sütras. In his Vakyãrtharatna áhobala says regarding the source of moral sense as follows : - " But Guru ( Prabhâkara ) says that so far as secular activitjr is concerned, whatever is fit, and possible to be worked out ( Kärya or duty ) as mirrored in the opinion of elders in societjr is ( ought to be ) a motive for work. " The Naiyãyikas or the logicians define a good motive foe work as " Balavadanistänanubandhi krtisãdyatã jnänam pravai-! takam " i. e., whatever is not seriously harmful and is at the same time possible of being accomplished is a duty and it is au a motive an incentive for action. According to Prabhâkara il; is the public opinion that enables one to understand the nature of duty. It follows therefore that proceedings opposed to publie opinion are immoral and are therefore ruinous. During the period of the Upanisads the elders in society whose opinion wais authoritative and binding were the Vänaprasthas. No king: who cared for the safety of his person and the security of hi« kingdom would forfeit the regard and good wishes of the hermits and thus endanger both his life and throne. During Aga- mic period the pious band of temple-worshippers of the type of the Saivite sixty three saints and the Vaisnavite Alvars formed the home of social opinion decisive of good and bad and right and. wrong course of action. Defiance of their opinion spelled danger to the safety of the state. Being of a warlike temperament, the Saivites were ever ready to eradicate impiety and sensualit3r from the kingdom of their god Siva, among whose servants the king was the head. Though naturally peace loving, the Vaisna- vites were not cowards in such matters. They were no less ready to put an end to impiety and sensuality in the kingdom of their god, Visftu. Thus the religious, ethical, and political restraints which the ancients brought to bear upon the conduct of their rulers were no less formidable than the constitutional brakes devised to arrest the precipitate speed of the state-engine. In modern European sta- tes the king or the president as the exeoutive head is made sub-</page><page sequence="21">Forms of Government in Ancient India 21 ordinate to the legislature and the judiciary whose independence in the interpretation and the administration of the state-law is maintained with scrupulous care and, as it were, with a sort of religious dread. The power of the peoples' representatives over the state purse is so unquestionable that the state machine can be made to stand still until the errors of the executive in their finan- cial administration are set right to the satisfaction of the repre- sentatives. Nevertheless the economic evils even in the model democratic states of Europe and America have grown so serious that a new class of critics known as socialists and communists come forward and began to question the ethical aspect of *he basic principles of democracy or parliamentary government itself. Seeing the growing poverty of the workers, the increasing con- centration of the capital in a few hands, the consequent depres- sion of the small capitalist into a dependent of the master- class, the extension of the market to the whole world as a unit with the resultant solidarity of labour fche whole world over, the socialsits have come to the conclusion that economic necessity is the real foundation upon which all other parts of social structure must be built. In his Communism p. 53 H. J. Laski says that "regarding parliamentary government the sceptic might reason- ably interject the observation that we are witnessing its increa- sing rejection rather than its increasing acceptance/' With it« military organisation the modern democratic state has proved too strong to be destroyed as easily as the mediaeval states were. Having the means of securing the good will of the people's re- presentatives Capitalism has grown in power under the disguised form of imperialism. The socialists are of opinion that 'law, religion, politics, philosophy-all these born of the reaction upon the human mind of the methods by which men wrest from nature the necessary means of life. Hence those who control the means occupy in a society a place of special power : it is a governing class. In short society consists of two classes ; those who control and those who are controlled. As a remedy for this anamolous state they propose the aboli- tion of private property and of the master class. Towards this end they proposelthe seizure of machinery of the state, to,- 'replace thç official class by socialists, to repress'capitalism, to substitytç</page><page sequence="22">22 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute corporation of workers consisting of legislature and executive for parliamentary government and lastly to keep the army in the hands of the workers. They say that parliament fools the common people. This however seems to be a wild dream. Apart from the ques- tion of its feasibility and of its productivity of the desired end, viz., "From each according to his power and to each according to His needs", the consequences of Russian revolution are believed to disprove the theory. "Broadly speaking* ' says H. J. Laski ( Communism p. 50 ), "there would not be much disagreement with the view that after a premature attempt at Communism the Bolshevists have reintroduced some of the normal features of a capital economy limited, however, by vigorous state control. From this it follows that form of government is least likely to change human nature. Whatever may be the form, whether des- potism, oligarchy, or democracy, some grow rich with the ma* jority remaining poor. It is a fact. Whether it is due to the Hindu Karma theory or to what is called heredity, we need not discuss the question. Taking inequality as a natural fact the an- cient Indian economists devised the ethico- economical solution of filling the pit with the soil taken from the elevated land in propor- tion to its extra rise in level. As already pointed out, they propo- sed to confiscate the surplus that remains afiier allowing an indi- vidual what is enough to maintain himself and his family for three years and to distribute the amount thus collected among the poor as capital for earning. In his social philosophy of Comte Edward Caird says (p. 36 ) that "the higher must stoop to con- quer the lower, by submission to it ;that those who are morally and intellectually great should learn self-abnegation and lead the lower, that they cease to influence men if they try to dominate them ; that a purely altruistic and intellectual being in whom personal motives do not exist would be best fitted to lead We need not pause here to enter into a discusision of the merits and demerits of this economical solution. The main point under our consideration is the comparative worth of the political restraints and checks applied to arrest the precipitate pursuit of a wrong course by the state machinery. It is clear from the foregoing exposition of the ethico-political restraints of the'ancient Indians</page><page sequence="23">Forms ôf Government in Ancient India 28 as compared with the. constitutional checks of modern parlia- mentarism that economically the mediaeval Hind d states fared far better under their theocratic form of government than modern European states under their parliamentary form of government. Neither in ancient nor in mediaeval India was there any possibility for despotic form of government to e*ifci The least propensity of a king to pursue a course of what are called seven vices, woman, liquor, gambling, hunting, etc,, was enough to bring about disaffection of his people and give an opportunity to usurpers to seize his kingdom with the coopera- tion of his disaffected subjects. Such rise and fall of kings did not affect the condition of the people. It was a misery of the kings and not of people. It is well known that when war was going on between Tippu and the English near Sirangapatam, the people were engaged in their agriculture and other possible pur- suits with as much peaoe of mind aB if there was no war. Noř did ancient warfare dislocate the economic condition of'the people as much as modern European warfare. The reason is that while ancient warfare was only between armies, modern warfare is between the opposing peoples themselves. Hence it was quite necessary to be vigilant and base the security of his throne on the loyalty of his prosperous people. Despotism with all its terrors and miseries, was unknown to mediaeval Indian states and it reigns supreme in most of modern Indian native states. With the exception of Mysore, Travancore and other few native states, the rest are under the worst type of despotism. Despots are human beings, and are therefore susceptible of at least some humane qualities. In their own interests they are sometimes kind to their subjects and it is easy for a host of sycophants and flatteres to floursih under the darkness of their dissipation. The causes of their despotic proceedings are not far to seek. The modern constitutional form of government with its wholesome checks has not dawned there. They are benighted lands ever in the dark. Of the ancient religious, ethical and political checks, they have all disappeared under the thunder of European sciences and machine guns. With the spread of the knowledge of modern experimental sciences, belief in transmigration, and spiritual pleasure was driven out- Fear of sin and of rebirth t reap theç&gt;</page><page sequence="24">24 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute harvests of seeds sown in the previous birth have received the name of superstition unworthy of entertainment by men of scientific education living with modern enlightenment. Spirit- ual pleasure is the dream of a diseased brain. It is only the idiots and the insane that do action with no aspiration for the fruits there. Sunk in physical and sensual pleasures, the princes have no time to spare to cultivate intellect and enjoy its pleasures. The princes are quite safe now and spend their life in pursuit of pleasure at all costs. The seven ▼ices are now seven pleasures for them. The whole of their state revenue is quite insufficient for them. They not only rackrent their people, but also mortage their states for the sake of money to spend on the seven pleasures. This is certainly worse than des- potism. European historians are quite justified in applying the word despotism ko the form of government prevailing in most of our native states at the present time. But to apply the same epithet to the forms of government that were prevalent in the ancient and mediaeval native states of India, before the advent of the Mahamadans and the British is not only unreasonable, but a positive encouragement to most of the princes to continue their wickedness under the delusion that their ancestors had no better form of government. It is high time that che princes should as soon as possible introduce the modern constitutional form of government in their states. It is impossible for them to revive the ancient ethico-political form of government or theocracy, for the enviroment and other conditions that were oongenial for the preservation of their vitality have long dis- appeared and cannot be revived.</page></plain_text>
